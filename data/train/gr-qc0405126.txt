    "one of the two main avenues for current research in quantum gravity is that of quantum geometry ( also known as loop quantum gravity ) .",
    "this is a theory that leads to space - time that is discrete at planck - length scales , giving rise to predictions of quantized areas and volumes ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in recent years",
    ", these ideas have been applied to the study of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "just as minisuperspace models reduce the infinitely many degrees of freedom down to a finite , quantum mechanical model , the basic idea of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is to use symmetry reduction to develop relatively simple models for various space - times .",
    "however , many of the features of lqc are similar to those in the full theory ; in particular , the hamiltonian constraint is constructed analogously to the full one @xcite , and as a consequence takes the form of a discrete recursion relation @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmological models are free of singularities , irrespective of the type of matter content @xcite .",
    "this is seen as a general consequence of the quantum evolution equation , which is a difference equation for the wave function and does not break down where the classical singularity would be . at the same time , additional conditions for the wave function can arise as consistency conditions for solutions of the difference equation whose coefficients can become zero .",
    "these conditions can be interpreted as dynamical initial conditions @xcite . for a vacuum isotropic model @xcite",
    ", it turns out that together with the notion of _ pre - classicality _",
    "@xcite a unique lqc solution is picked out .",
    "pre - classicality requires the coefficients of the wave function to lack large variations over planck - scale lengths , and thus allows the solution to match a semi - classical wave function far away from the singularity .",
    "because one is dealing with discrete recursion relations , this means that as the parameter is increased by one , there should not be a great change in the value of the coefficients .",
    "( a precise definition of pre - classicality would require more information about observables and the physical inner product than is presently available @xcite . )",
    "the situation is more complicated in anisotropic models , with several independent directions in minisuperspace along which oscillations need to be suppressed , and therefore the hamiltonian constraint becomes a partial difference equation .",
    "we will look in detail at the bianchi i lrs model , which has only two independent degrees of freedom and simplifies thanks to its separable evolution equation . as we will see , the generic sequence alternates between positive and negative values , thus exhibiting huge oscillations .",
    "however , with the new techniques introduced here to lqc it is possible to select out special boundary values that give pre - classical sequences ; from this set of possibilities , pre - classical wave functions can be built up .",
    "because these generating function methods can be used to solve generic ( partial ) difference equations , they are useful to obtain pre - classical solutions for other lqc models and their hamiltonian constraints .",
    "to study the relation between the quantum theory and its classical limit , it is of particular interest to construct solutions which in presumed semiclassical regimes describe wave packets following classical trajectories at least approximately .",
    "this requires a sufficiently large set of independent pre - classical solutions such that an initial wave packet can be formed by superposition . that this is realized is not at all obvious .",
    "for instance , the continuum limit of the difference equation with the corresponding ( dewitt @xcite ) initial condition is not well - posed ( solutions to the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation which are zero at the boundaries of minisuperspace do not suffice to allow reasonable initial data ) .",
    "even though there are lqc models which are well - posed in contrast to their wheeler  dewitt analog @xcite , it is conceivable that in a model like that studied here the lack of well - posedness in the continuum limit precludes the existence of sufficiently many pre - classical solutions .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case as will be discussed later together with possible consequences and interpretations .",
    "the loop quantized hamiltonian constraint for the particular case of a bianchi i lrs space - time used here has already been worked out  @xcite . here",
    "we present more systematic methods of finding solutions with particular properties , which are useful not only for this space - time , but for any model system to be considered in loop quantum gravity . in section [ sep - sec ] ,",
    "we discuss in detail how to use generating functions to obtain information about a sequence with one parameter .",
    "this allows us to tune the magnitude and asymptotic behavior of the sequence by choosing the appropriate initial values . by combining two such one - parameter sequences",
    ", we can solve the bianchi i lrs recursion relation , and pick appropriate combinations to have the desired properties at large values of the evolution parameter @xmath0 .",
    "section [ full - sec ] generalizes the similar method to solve the full two parameter recursion relation .",
    "however , because of numerical limitations , the actual sequence is obtained only over a small extent in the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , but still its properties can be tuned by appropriate choices of boundary conditions .",
    "the general solutions we obtain here are similar in form to those of section [ sep - sec ] . as an application of the results we discuss the issue of pre - classical solutions and the semiclassical limit in the conclusions .",
    "the bianchi i lrs ( locally rotationally symmetric ) model is the simplest anisotropic model , being derived from the bianchi i model with symmetry group @xmath2 by imposing the condition of one rotational symmetry .",
    "there are thus two degrees of freedom left .",
    "in addition , the classical equations of motion of the model can easily be decoupled , and the quantum hamiltonian separates .",
    "we will first recall the basic equations of this model from the appendix of @xcite and then discuss its separated evolution equations .",
    "the bianchi i lrs model has two degrees of freedom which , in real ashtekar variables , are given by two connection components @xmath3 and the conjugate momenta @xmath4 with sympletic structure given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 is the gravitational constant and @xmath8 the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter of loop quantum gravity .",
    "the momenta @xmath4 are components of an invariant densitized triad which determine the scale factors @xmath9 of a bianchi i metric by @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the metric is @xmath12 in cartesian coordinates and is degenerate for @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as functions of time is determined by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath15 which is proportional to @xmath16 , leading to decoupled hamiltonian equations of motion solved by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . after introducing a new time",
    "coordinate @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath22 and @xmath23 and thus scale factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 whose exponents @xmath26 and @xmath27 indeed solve the kasner conditions for bianchi i solutions , @xmath28 in the special lrs case @xmath29 .",
    "after quantizing the model with loop techniques @xcite , the triad components @xmath30 and @xmath31 become basic operators with discrete spectra , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the wave function is thus supported on a discrete minsuperspace , and as a solution to the quantized hamiltonian constraint subject to a difference equation , @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the coefficients of the wave function ( rescaled by a factor of the world volume of each basis state ) .",
    "also we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the remainder of the paper , the parameter @xmath0 will act as a `` time '' parameter . defining @xmath38 ( @xmath39 )",
    ", the recursion relation simplifies to @xmath40   + 2 d_2 ( m ) [ t_{m , n+1 } - t_{m , n-1 } ] = 0.\\ ] ] note that for typographical simplicity , here and throughout the rest of the paper the notation @xmath41 and @xmath35 has been reversed from their use in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath35 includes the volume of each basis state , it follows that @xmath42 must vanish at the boundaries , @xmath43 . because of its definition in terms of @xmath35 , the values @xmath44 are freely specifiable ; the boundary condition @xmath45 is then used in computing @xmath46 from @xmath47 via @xmath48 .",
    "we still must have @xmath49 , which will act as boundary conditions for our sequence .",
    "the continuum limit of the difference equation is obtained at large triad components ( or in the @xmath50 limit @xcite ) , which implies @xmath51 such that the difference operators can be approximated by differentials .",
    "one thus arrives at the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the continuous function that interpolates the discrete @xmath54 for large @xmath55 .",
    "note that the difference equation ( [ diff ] ) for @xmath42 is of order four , higher than that of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation , which is always second order .",
    "this is a consequence of the loop quantization and can not be avoided .",
    "it implies that there are more independent solutions to the discrete equation than the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation has ; in fact , not all the discrete solutions have a continuum limit .",
    "those which do have such a limit are the pre - classical solutions which do not change rapidly if the discrete labels @xmath1 and @xmath0 are increased .",
    "it is known that , when boundary conditions are not taken into account , there are always sufficiently many pre - classical solutions for the semiclassical limit to be achieved @xcite . in practice , finding those solutions is usually difficult when also boundary conditions have to be taken into account .",
    "solutions of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation can easily be studied after introducing @xmath56 and separating the resulting differential equation @xmath57 .",
    "writing @xmath58 we obtain the conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 solved by @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , any non - zero solution @xmath63 diverges either at the boundary @xmath13 or at the classical singularity @xmath14 unless @xmath64 . for the original wave function",
    "@xmath65 this implies that solutions regular at the boundary are available only for @xmath66 .",
    "dewitt s condition @xmath67 in this model , which says that there is zero probability of finding the universe at a singularity , is thus ill - posed since not enough separable solutions for constructing given initial values are available  @xcite .",
    "the difference equation @xmath68 for @xmath41 can be solved similarly by assuming that the sequence @xmath41 is separable into two one - parameter sequences @xmath69 and @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "this is possible if @xmath69 and @xmath70 satisfy    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the separation parameter now for the sequences .",
    "any choice of these two sequences will solve the original recursion relation ; because the @xmath74 and @xmath75 relations are second - order , the first two values @xmath76 and @xmath77 , for example , are enough to describe the rest of the sequence @xmath74 for a particular @xmath73 .",
    "however , as noted before the order is higher than that of the 1st order separated wheeler ",
    "dewitt equations and there are additional solutions with large oscillations . for negative @xmath73 , for instance ,",
    "picking any two random values for the boundary data will generically give sequences that alternate between positive and negative values with magnitudes that increase as the parameter ( @xmath1 or @xmath0 ) increases .",
    "an example of such a generic choice is shown in figure [ oscill ] . because of this alternation , the wave function will not be smooth at large @xmath0 and therefore not be pre - classical",
    ".    that solutions generically have alternating behavior can be understood as follows : for large @xmath1 , the right hand side of ( [ a - eqn ] ) is usually small compared to the left hand side such that @xmath78 .",
    "the relation between neighboring values , @xmath79 and @xmath74 , is determined by the initial values @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "together they determine @xmath80 . for negative @xmath73 , and @xmath81 , say , @xmath82 has the opposite sign from @xmath77 which translates to @xmath74 having the opposite sign from @xmath79 for large @xmath1 and thus alternating behavior .",
    "if @xmath83 , @xmath82 may have the same sign as @xmath77 , but still generically oscillations will set in later . only for positive @xmath73",
    "is it easy to suppress the oscillations .",
    "however , since @xmath73 enters the equation for @xmath75 with the sign reversed , now the @xmath84-sequence will develop alternating behavior such that the full solution alternates generically .",
    "we will develop techniques , which can be used analytically or numerically , to check whether it is possible to choose special initial values such that oscillations are suppressed .",
    "this will fix the relation between initial values and thus reduce the amount of freedom in pre - classical solutions . in particular , values like @xmath76 may not be allowed to vanish . while this does not pose a problem for the @xmath85-sequence , for the @xmath84-sequence we have a different initial value problem , requiring @xmath86 as a consequence of @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for the @xmath75 the only way to suppress oscillations is by restricting to @xmath88 .      our strategy for choosing the initial values of the sequence @xmath74 will be to work with a generating function .",
    "this is a function of one variable @xmath89 such that the value @xmath74 is the coefficient of @xmath90 in a taylor expansion , i.e. @xmath91 this will allow us to go from a recursion relation for @xmath74 to a differential equation for @xmath92 . to see how this works , we look at how derivatives act on the function @xmath93 , for a fixed @xmath94 .",
    "we have @xmath95 = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty } ( m + k ) a_m x^{m + k - 1},\\ ] ] so we can see that linear functions of @xmath1 in the recurrence relation become linear derivatives of the generating function .",
    "this makes it easier to work with @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 because @xmath96 , unlike @xmath97 , is polynomial and the map between recursion relation and differential equation is more obvious .",
    "techniques for studying the values of the @xmath75 sequence will be discussed later .",
    "we start with the recursion relation ( [ a - eqn ] ) for @xmath74 , multiply it by @xmath98 and sum over all values of @xmath1 for which the relation is valid ( i.e. @xmath99 ) ; then the sum is written as , so that all coefficients are of the form @xmath100 , instead of beginning at @xmath101 ( with a @xmath102 term ) to avoid placing extra relations on the coefficients @xmath74 .",
    "this has the effect of shifting @xmath103 . ]",
    "@xmath104 x^m = 0.\\ ] ] by mapping instances of @xmath1 into derivatives , we arrive at the differential equation for @xmath105 given by @xmath106 -   2\\lambda\\frac{f(x ) - a_0}{x } = 0\\ ] ] or @xmath107-   2\\lambda\\frac{f(x)}{x}+a_0\\frac{1 + 2\\lambda x}{x^2}=0\\,.\\ ] ] as written , this equation has singularities at @xmath108 and 1 , which makes it problematic to expand around @xmath109 in the taylor series expansion ( [ expand ] ) of the generating function ; however , we are interested not in the solution itself , but in the relation between the coefficients in its series expansion . because of this , there is some freedom to find an equation more tractable to analysis , so it is natural to define a new function @xmath110 substituting this in to the relation for @xmath105 gives a simpler differential equation for @xmath111 , @xmath112 - 2\\lambda g(x ) = a_0.\\ ] ] by going from @xmath105 to @xmath111 , we have reduced the number of singularities by one , but the question now is to relate this new generating function to the sequence @xmath74 . if we take @xmath113 then the mapping ( [ 1d - shift ] ) between the generating functions @xmath105 and @xmath111 implies that the two sequences @xmath74 and @xmath114 are related by @xmath115 thus , simplifying the differential equation has resulted in a `` shift '' upward in the sequences .",
    "once we know the two initial values of the @xmath114 sequence , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , then we can find those of the @xmath74 sequence by using @xmath118 which comes from the recursion relation ( [ a - eqn ] ) for @xmath74 in the particular case @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the relation between @xmath119 and @xmath120 implies one between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the information in this differential equation is equivalent to that in the recurrence relation ; any series solution of the differential equation ( [ gen - ode ] ) will solve the relation ( [ a - eqn ] ) for @xmath74 , after shifting @xmath114 back to @xmath74 via ( [ alph - def ] ) .",
    "the question now is how to avoid alternating oscillatory behavior in the sequence .",
    "we look at the function @xmath121 , which is a function that generates the _ differences _ between adjacent values of @xmath114 , that is , @xmath122 if this function has no singularities , then the sequence @xmath114 will converge to a finite value without oscillation .",
    "because of the @xmath123 factor appearing in the differential equation ( [ gen - ode ] ) for @xmath111 , the function will in general have poles at @xmath124 .",
    "thus the function is regular for @xmath125 , and if there is no singularity at @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 such that the sequence @xmath114 has a finite limit . moreover , if there is not a pole at @xmath128 , @xmath129 , so alternating oscillations are suppressed .",
    "this avoids situations such as that seen , for example , in the taylor expansion of @xmath130 , where the coefficients of @xmath90 alternate sign : @xmath131 obviously , @xmath121 will have the same behavior at @xmath128 that @xmath111 does ; we avoid oscillations by requiring no singularity in the function @xmath111 at @xmath128 . from this",
    ", we get a relation between the two initial values @xmath119 and @xmath120 . the story is slightly different at @xmath126 ; @xmath111 may blow up there , but @xmath121 can be finite if , e.g. , @xmath111 has a simple pole at @xmath126 .",
    "two examples of this are seen in the expansions for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , @xmath135 in the first , the coefficients of the sequence maintain a constant value ; in the second , they converge to zero .",
    "we will see that the latter is exactly the behavior found generically in the solutions @xmath111 for negative @xmath73 .    with this in mind",
    ", we take as a particular example the choice @xmath136 ; solving our differential equation for the generating function @xmath111 given in @xmath137 with the condition @xmath138 , we obtain the solution @xmath139 in obtaining this solution from the differential equation ( [ gen - ode ] ) for @xmath111 , we have used the relation ( [ ic - rel ] ) between @xmath76 and the initial values @xmath119 and @xmath120 . for generic values",
    "@xmath119 and @xmath120 , this function will have singularities at @xmath140 ; to ensure that the singularity at @xmath128 does not give rise to oscillatory behavior at large @xmath1 , we require that @xmath141 = 0.\\ ] ] when we solve this relation , we find that @xmath142 which already implies that @xmath143 is regular at @xmath128 .",
    "notice that the @xmath126 singularity remains because of the @xmath134 term ; however , @xmath144 is zero at @xmath126 , so @xmath143 is regular . as discussed above , this is a `` good '' singularity where the coefficients of the taylor series go as @xmath145 ; this behavior in @xmath74 is seen in figure [ good - a(m ) ] .",
    "we remark here , however , that only for negative @xmath73 do we get the type of behavior seen above ; when @xmath146 , the pole at @xmath126 is of higher order .    for arbitrary @xmath73 we first solve the homogeneous equation ( [ gen - ode ] ) for @xmath81 by @xmath147 . by varying the constant @xmath148",
    "we obtain the general solution to the inhomogeneous equation as @xmath149 with @xmath150 for @xmath151 in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath152 .",
    "( if @xmath153 , the equation can be integrated in a manner similar to the @xmath154 case . ) this gives @xmath155 where only the first term determines the singularity structure at @xmath128 since the hypergeometric function @xmath156 is regular at @xmath157 taking the value @xmath158 for all @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the singularity at @xmath128 can always be removed by choosing @xmath160 . since @xmath161 with the digamma function @xmath162",
    ", this translates to the condition @xmath163 this expression is finite for all @xmath73 which are not positive integers since the digamma function is analytic except for simple poles at @xmath164 . for @xmath154 , for instance , we can use @xmath165 and re - obtain the special case studied before .    at @xmath126",
    ", @xmath166 has a branch point which is logarithmic for @xmath167 or @xmath168 .",
    "thus , @xmath143 always has a singularity at @xmath126 , which for positive @xmath73 is enhanced by the factor @xmath169 .",
    "thus , for @xmath170 the sequence @xmath114 is unbounded .",
    "now we turn to putting the @xmath74 and @xmath75 sequences back together . for each @xmath73 , a pre - classical sequence @xmath41",
    " when the boundary values have been appropriately tuned  is completely characterized by the choice of @xmath73 , with an additional scaling factor . because @xmath171 by the boundary conditions on the sequence , changing @xmath172 will simply scale the magnitude of the @xmath75 values .",
    "similarly , pre - classicality requires a relation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , so one is fixed by the choice of the other , while varying this choice will again only scale the @xmath74 sequence . since increasing @xmath172 by a constant factor and decreasing both @xmath76 and @xmath77 by the same factor ( to preserve their relationship ) leaves the @xmath41 sequence constant , only one of these is independent .",
    "thus , a general pre - classical solution @xmath173 can be written as a sum @xmath174 , with the coefficient @xmath175 used to scale the individual terms of the sum .",
    "we can use linear combinations of these to get a generic solution . as an example of this , we require that the sequence @xmath41 match a gaussian wave packet in the parameter @xmath1 , at large values of @xmath0 ( see figures [ sep - graph ] and [ final - sep ] ) .",
    "one difficulty in doing this , however , is apparent when looking at the @xmath74 graph , figure [ good - a(m ) ] ; because the sequence becomes essentially constant for large @xmath1 , it is difficult to get the necessary discrimination in @xmath1 for the wave packet was the `` @xmath1 derivative '' of the original sequence @xmath35 , so one might wonder if these conclusions change when @xmath176 is used .",
    "in fact , they remain much the same  since @xmath74 gives the change in @xmath35 with @xmath1 , its decline to zero means that @xmath35 is basically constant for large @xmath1 .",
    "thus , again only at small @xmath1 is the spatial discrimination possible to build a wave function with desired properties at large @xmath0 . ] .",
    "in the previous section , we looked at separating out the @xmath1 and @xmath0 dependence into two distinct sequences , then using generating function methods to analyze the @xmath74 sequence . because this has reduced the problem to finding the right initial values @xmath76 and @xmath77 , there is much to be said for the simplicity of this method .",
    "however , we can ask whether the full recursion relation ( [ diff - eqn ] ) is amenable to study by generating functions .",
    "we shall see that this is feasible , and provides a method to study other spacetimes where the recursion relation may not be separable ( which includes the schwarzschild black hole interior @xcite ) .    starting again with the general difference equation @xmath68 , we can work with a generating function @xmath177 , which describes the sequence . because occurrences of @xmath0 translate to derivatives @xmath178 of the generating function",
    ", the function @xmath97 on the surface presents a problem  there would be a non - polynomial function of derivatives acting on the generating function . to deal with this ,",
    "we write the sequence @xmath41 as @xmath179 where the @xmath180 satisfy    @xmath181   + \\frac{2}{m } [ t^{(0)}_{m , n+1 } - t^{(0)}_{m , n-1 } ] & = 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2n } [ t^{(k)}_{m+1 , n } - t^{(k)}_{m-1 , n } ]   + \\frac{2}{m } [ t^{(k)}_{m , n+1 } - t^{(k)}_{m , n-1 } ] & = \\left(\\frac{1}{2n}-d(n)\\right ) ( t^{(k-1)}_{m+1,n}-t^{(k-1)}_{m-1,n})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , we are using the fact that @xmath182 to write the sequence @xmath41 as a perturbation series .",
    "in other words , we choose the leading order sequence @xmath183 to satisfy a recursion relation with coefficients polynomial in the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , such that a partial differential equation can be found that is equivalent to the @xmath183 relation ( [ diff - eqn2 ] ) . boundary or initial values would then be set such that @xmath184 is pre - classical , i.e.  by removing singularities of the generating function . for higher terms @xmath185 , @xmath186",
    ", we can choose vanishing boundary and initial values .",
    "each such contribution by itself would not be pre - classical , but its oscillations would contribute only small perturbations to @xmath184 . indeed",
    ", because of the small difference between @xmath187 and @xmath97 , the right hand side of the equations for @xmath188 , @xmath189 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath190 compared to the left hand side .",
    "it is thus consistent with pre - classicality to use the relation for @xmath184 in order to fix boundary values as before , and then solve the relations for higher @xmath185 with boundary and initial values zero . with a vanishing right hand side",
    "the solution would be @xmath191 for @xmath186 , and the small right hand side will lead to small values for the higher terms which become negligible compared to the @xmath183 values . because of this , for the rest of the paper we focus on solving for the sequence @xmath183 ; obtaining finer accuracy for small @xmath55 would be possible using higher @xmath180    working with the @xmath183 sequence , we look for a partial differential equation for the generating function @xmath192 multiplying the recursion relation ( [ diff - eqn2 ] ) for @xmath193 by @xmath194 and summing over all values it is valid gives @xmath195",
    "x^m y^n = 0,\\ ] ] and we arrive at an equation for @xmath177 which is similar in form to the separable case , i.e. there are singularities at @xmath196 . to avoid this , we define a new function @xmath197 as @xmath198 = \\frac { [ f(x , y ) - y a(y ) ] } { xy},\\ ] ] where @xmath199 is related to the generating function of the @xmath200 boundary for the original @xmath183 sequence ( the definition of @xmath201 chosen here is to simplify the form of our eventual differential equation for @xmath197 ) .",
    "this sum begins at @xmath202 , since the boundary conditions imply @xmath203 .",
    "this gives a `` shifted '' sequence , since @xmath204 note the similarity between this relation between @xmath177 and @xmath205 , and the analogous one between @xmath105 and @xmath111 in the separable case .",
    "again , the coefficients are shifted by one , now in each of the parameters ; if @xmath206 then @xmath207 this gives us the pde @xmath208 +   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y } [ ( 1 - y^2 ) g(x , y ) ] = a(y).\\ ] ] again , we will have singularities at both @xmath124 and @xmath209 .",
    "our discussion of the singularities in section [ sep - sec ] for separable solutions carries over here similarly for functions of two variables .",
    "first , we want the functions @xmath210 and @xmath211 both to be finite for all values of @xmath89 and @xmath212 , respectively , to ensure that at large @xmath1 or @xmath0 , the sequence is either constant or smoothly changing . putting these together means that @xmath213 has to be finite for all @xmath214 . as with the separable solutions ,",
    "the only problem with this might be at @xmath128 and @xmath215 .",
    "one condition for @xmath216 to be finite along these two lines in the @xmath217 plane is that the function @xmath218 satisfies @xmath219 .",
    "when we solve for @xmath197 in terms of @xmath220 in the above relation ( [ g - h - eqn ] ) , we find the new equation @xmath221",
    "so , given our boundary conditions on @xmath220 mentioned above , and any choice for @xmath201 , we can solve this equation numerically .",
    "this is exactly how we would go about finding the sequence if there was a desired sequence of values @xmath44 , which is what @xmath201 specifies .",
    "however , more likely one wants a particular limiting case for the sequence @xmath41 for large @xmath0 , for example . here",
    ", the properties of the functions @xmath197 and @xmath220 come into play . because it is assumed that @xmath216 is finite",
    ", then @xmath197 itself can have simple poles at @xmath126 and @xmath222 .",
    "for the cases mentioned in section [ sep - sec ]  the functions @xmath223 and @xmath224  the coefficients in the taylor series converge to constant values ( unity in the first sequence , zero in the second ) .",
    "so , if one looks at the expansion in @xmath212 , the coefficients of @xmath197 will assume some constant profile in @xmath89 for large powers @xmath225 ; this profile will be determined by , e.g. , the residue of the function @xmath205 at a simple pole @xmath222 . up to a constant factor , this is simply the function @xmath226 ; along the lines @xmath126 and @xmath222 , the function @xmath220 gives us information about the asymptotic behavior of the sequence @xmath41 . in fact",
    ", @xmath226 is simply the generating function reflecting how @xmath41 behaves at large @xmath0 , and similarly for @xmath227 .",
    "thus , to assemble the desired profile at , say , large @xmath0 , one requires that @xmath226 be a certain function , treating the @xmath225 coefficients of the source term @xmath201 as unknowns to be solved for",
    ". this can be done either numerically or by using pseudo - spectral methods ; the form of the partial differential equation makes it particularly amenable to the use of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure [ spectral ] ; notice that this has the same basic shape as the sequence assembled out of the separable solutions in section [ sep - sec ] .",
    "loop quantum cosmology has discrete evolution equations of higher order than the wheeler ",
    "dewitt differential equation which is obtained in a continuum limit .",
    "there are thus additional independent solutions which display an alternating behavior .",
    "those solutions are not necessarily unphysical and can in fact contain important information about quantum effects . nevertheless , for studying the semiclassical limit of those models it is important to have control on the subset of solutions for which the small - scale oscillations are suppressed .",
    "in particular , one needs to find selection criteria for this subset , usually by specifying initial or boundary values .",
    "choosing those special values , if possible at all , is thus not done to achieve a particular physical consequence and does not amount to fine - tuning .",
    "as demonstrated here for the bianchi i lrs model , appropriate solutions can be extracted analytically by employing generating function techniques .",
    "it is emphasized here that these methods will work with other partial difference equations , so they can be applied to any lqc model .    for this particular model we can apply the results to discuss the initial value problem .",
    "in general , one would need separated solutions for all values of the separation parameter in order to construct a given initial wave packet at large @xmath0 , far away from the classical singularity at @xmath228 . the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation with dewitt s initial conditions does not allow sufficiently many solutions and thus presents an ill - posed initial value problem . for the difference equation of loop quantum cosmology ,",
    "the initial value problem is well - posed in the sense that there are always non - trivial solutions . however , in the semiclassical limit one also has to find enough solutions which do not oscillate strongly at small scales .",
    "one may then speculate that analogously to the ill - posed wheeler ",
    "dewitt problem there are not sufficiently many pre - classical solutions .",
    "another system which is ill - posed from the wheeler ",
    "dewitt point of view , an isotropic model with a free , massless scalar has been studied in @xcite . there",
    "it turned out that the loop problem is well - posed and still allows enough pre - classical solutions .",
    "however , the situation there was different in that the matter term was responsible for the ill - posedness of the continuum formulation .",
    "the bianchi i lrs model thus presents a qualitatively different system to study well - posedness , which can be done in detail with the methods developed in this paper .",
    "what we have seen is that for negative separation parameter @xmath73 we can find pre - classical solutions .",
    "the problems of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantization at the boundary @xmath13 do not occur in the discrete formulation and pre - classicality puts strong restrictions on the sequence @xmath74 fixing its boundary values .",
    "the sequence @xmath75 has only small oscillations for @xmath88 such that one can choose a pre - classical solution .    for positive @xmath73 ,",
    "on the other hand , the situation is different .",
    "now , the @xmath74 sequence is not problematic , and for @xmath75 one would have to choose special initial values in order to guarantee pre - classicality . however , since @xmath86 is required by the difference equation , this option is not available and @xmath75 will always be alternating for positive @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 does not have a continuum limit but @xmath229 does .",
    "however , the corresponding continuum limit of the difference equation acting on @xmath230 has an additional relative minus sign from the @xmath231 such that one obtains a different wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation : introducing @xmath232 into the difference equation ( [ diff - eqn ] ) for @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath233=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sign of the second term is switched .",
    "this is an example of different continuum limits obtained from one and the same difference equation , which , from the point of view of the discrete formulation , can be interpreted as a duality between different continuum formulations @xcite .    in order to construct semiclassical wave packets at large @xmath0",
    ", one can try to use only negative @xmath73 in order to avoid oscillations .",
    "however , the resulting solutions are mostly concentrated at small values of @xmath1 since the pre - classical separable solutions @xmath74 decrease with @xmath1 .",
    "one can also see that using only negative @xmath73 is not enough by observing that the wheeler ",
    "dewitt solutions @xmath234 for positive integer @xmath73 are just what one needs for a taylor expansion from which one could construct any analytical initial wave packet .",
    "using these @xmath73 in the discrete case requires to have alternating @xmath75 , which implies that such wave packets do not follow the classical trajectory since they are solutions to the wheeler - dewitt equation with a sign flip .",
    "thus , in this model the discrete analog of dewitt s initial condition may be problematic .",
    "it is possible to avoid dewitt s initial condition by using a symmetric version of the constraint ( which is non - singular if the constraint is symmetrized after multiplying with @xmath235 @xcite ) . in this way",
    "detailed studies of models can teach lessons for the full theory since the same ordering should be used in all cases . with this symmetric ordering , @xmath236 would be free such that it can be fixed as done for the @xmath74 sequence if one requires a pre - classical solution .",
    "however , due to the symmetrization of the constraint operator the difference equation will change and be more complicated ; moreover , one loses conditions on the wave function .",
    "even with the non - symmetric constraint used here , it follows from the results of this paper that , with the condition of pre - classicality in addition to dynamical initial conditions , the wave function will not be unique .    alternatively",
    ", one can take the lack of pre - classical solutions seriously for this model .",
    "if we only look at large values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , i.e.  only at the semiclassical regime , there is no problem at all and we can construct any initial state we like . most of those states would not solve the initial conditions imposed by the quantum constraint at the classical singularity and thus have to be discarded . at this point , however , we already use information from the quantum theory : the behavior of the wave function at the classical singularity is invoked .",
    "thus , the properties of wave functions discussed here can be interpreted as a quantum effect .",
