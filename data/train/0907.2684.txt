    "top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known to - date discovered at fermilab in 1995 @xcite . during the current run  ii period of the tevatron accelerator ,",
    "the growing statistics permits to study in detail further kinematic properties of the top pair production as well as recently observed electroweak production of individual top quarks .",
    "we preset the latest results on the @xmath0 cross sections measurements , their combination and interpretation in terms of limits on new physics .",
    "we summarise the current state of the observation of the single top quark production and the measurements and searches based on the @xmath1 vertex properties .",
    "as the top quark was first observed produced in @xmath0 pairs via the strong interaction , the pair production is the obvious first handle to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) while the decaying system properties can be used as an electroweak laboratory to search for new physics . at tevatron",
    "the production proceeds mostly via @xmath2 annihilation ( 85% ) accompanied by the @xmath3 fusion ( 15% ) .",
    "the final states of the @xmath0 system are determined by the leptonic , hadronic or mixed decays modes of the @xmath4-bosons .",
    "the dilepton ( @xmath5 ) final state is easy to identify , has low background , but also low branching fraction ; the @xmath6jet channels ( with prompt @xmath7 or cascade @xmath8 ) have larger branching fraction , more background , but have only one escaping neutrino ; the hadronic channel has the largest branching ratio , but suffers from overwhelming background from qcd multijet production .",
    "dedicated @xmath9jets analyses are challenged by the @xmath10 lepton identification , but provide important additional information and offer windows on testing new models with prominent couplings to @xmath10 .",
    "the cross - section analysis in the @xmath6jets was divided into several bins in terms of the jet multiplicity , with @xmath11 + 1,2  jets serving as a control sample to tune selection and data / simulation agreement , and the 3 and @xmath12 jet bins ( with larger signal fraction ) for the measurement itself .",
    "we required at least one jet identified as a @xmath13-jet using a neural network ( nn ) @xmath13-tagger , one isolated lepton and large missing transverse energy .",
    "additionally the leading jet @xmath14 was required to be @xmath15gev .",
    "most of standard model backgrounds were modelled using alpgen+pythia parton shower , including theory nlo / lo scale factors .",
    "the largest physics background comes from the @xmath16jets events , other backgrounds include diboson and single top production .",
    "as there is no reliable model of the multijet production beyond several final state hard partons , the multijet background was taken from a special data with inverted cut on the lepton isolation .",
    "the signal fraction grows with the number of the @xmath13-tagged jets ( see  figure  [ fig : ljjets ] , left ) . a kinematic likelihood discriminant based on several topological and kinematic variables ( see  figure  [ fig : ljjets ] , right )",
    "was employed to fit the @xmath0 fraction and the cross - section .",
    "cross - section measurements in @xmath6jets , @xmath5 and @xmath17 channels were combined using a total of 14 orthogonal channels , the combined cross - section was fitted using a likelihood function with poisson terms for signal and background yields .",
    "systematic uncertainties are included using gaussian probability density function .",
    "the combined result is @xmath18 , assuming @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties dominate the error on this result .",
    "we also provide the ratios of cross - sections between the channels @xmath20 , where most of systematics cancel , leading to results on @xmath21 and @xmath22 which are consistent with the sm value of 1 and are shown in  figure  [ fig : xsect_combi_d0_cdf ] .",
    "in addition , cross - section ratios between individual channels can be used to set upper limits on the @xmath23 branching ratio , as for @xmath24 one would observe an enhancement of the @xmath10 channel ( using @xmath25 ) .",
    "leptophobic @xmath26 would lead to an enhancement of the @xmath6jets channel ( using @xmath27 .",
    "we extracted the expected and observed upper limits as shown in  figure  [ fig : ttbar_h_limits ] using pseudo - experiments derived from the data distributions .",
    "the current tevatron @xmath28 combined measurement is precise to @xmath29gev @xcite , triggering discussions on the definition and interpretations of the top mass which is actually measured .",
    "a complementary information on @xmath28 with different sensitivity to theoretical and experimental uncertainties can be extracted from the @xmath30 dependence .",
    "assuming different @xmath31 , the measured @xmath0 cross - section can be compared to nlo and approximate nnlo ( nll ) calculations , where @xmath28 definition is usually the pole mass .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath28 range from @xmath32 to @xmath33gev depending on the theory used , with errors of @xmath34gev , being in good agreement with the world - average of @xmath35gev @xcite as depicted in  figure  [ fig : mass_from_xsect ] .",
    "the electroweak ( single ) top quark production had been one of the remaining sm processes to be observed until recently @xcite , with the evidences for single top production reported by the tevatron collider experiments in 2007 @xcite and 2008 @xcite . indeed , this process has a much larger background and smaller cross - section compared to the @xmath0 production . at the same time ,",
    "observation of the single top production is rewarding in providing a direct access to the @xmath1 vertex properties and another window to new physics .",
    "two basic production modes can be distinguished at lo , denoted the @xmath36 and @xmath37-channels .    the basic experimental requirements to measure the single top cross - section include the selection of events with one isolated lepton and at least two jets with at least one with @xmath38gev .",
    "in addition , the missing transverse energy ( @xmath39-signature ) is required to be @xmath40gev in the two - jet ( @xmath41 ) bin .",
    "one or two of the jets is required to originate from @xmath13-hadrons using the secondary vertex information incorporated into a neural net @xmath13-tagger . selecting 4,519 @xmath13-tagged events",
    ", we expect @xmath42 single top events with signal acceptances of 3.7% ( 2.5% ) for @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "as the expected signal fraction of 39% is in fact smaller than the background uncertainty , a simple counting experiment method is impossible and multivariate techniques are needed to extract the signal .",
    "three analysis methods named boosted decision trees ( bdt ) , bayesian neural - network ( bnn ) , matrix element ( me ) giving consistent results were employed and used to produce a combined discriminant ( see  figure  [ fig : d0_singletop_2 ] ) . the result based on @xmath45 data collected by the d detector",
    "is shown in  table  [ table : singletop_individual ] .",
    "being 5060% correlated , combining the individual results leads to an improved significance .",
    "the combined cross - section measurement is then @xmath46         one can also search new phenomena in the same final state , e.g. for charged higgs bosons decaying to top and bottom quarks in @xmath49 collisions @xcite .",
    "limits on the charged higgs mass a function of @xmath50 were set based on a discriminating variable of the jet - jet-@xmath4 invariant mass ( figure  [ fig : d0_singletop_4 ] ) .",
    "single top production also provides a direct access to the properties of the @xmath1 vertex , allowing a search for anomalous top quark couplings @xcite .",
    "the sm lagrangian allows only the @xmath51 vertex structure , but a more general form can be probed : @xmath52 where sm corresponds to the case of @xmath53 , @xmath54 . using the @xmath4 helicity measurement in the @xmath55jet channel ( which constrains form factors ratios ) for probability density priors , the extracted bayesian limits on the vector and axial vector form factors are @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 assuming @xmath53 ."
