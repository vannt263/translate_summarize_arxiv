    "understanding the properties of rarefied quantum systems is a fundamental question that has been addressed in a large number of works .",
    "this problem was extensively studied in the 50s-60s when significant development of mathematical formalism ( perturbative methods , feynman diagrams , diagonalization techniques , etc . ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite ) permitted to obtain important results and brought a lot of interest to dilute quantum systems .",
    "some important results were as well obtained in low - dimensional systems @xcite , which at that moment were rather mathematical toys with reduced applicability in the real world .",
    "the situation changed radically with the realization of bose - einstein condensation in dilute gases@xcite .",
    "having an excellent experimental control over the geometry of the cloud it was possible to create essentially pure quantum gases in the dilute regime and to probe the system properties .",
    "the experimental advances in the field with the realization of very anisotropic traps stimulated further the interest in dilute low dimensional gases ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in the ultradilute limit the interparticle potential can be described by one parameter , namely the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 , and the ground state properties of a gas are governed by the gas parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the particle density and @xmath4 stays for the dimensionality . as the density is increased details of the interaction potential become important .",
    "such a non - universal regime has been thoroughly studied in three - dimensional geometries , where the universal terms are known @xcite .",
    "low energy corrections coming from the specific interaction potential can be described by the effective range @xmath5 .",
    "corrections to the ground - state energy , excitation spectrum and condensate fraction can be obtained ( see , for example , @xcite and more recent works @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that for two body problem the inclusion of an energy - dependent pseudopotential improves significantly upon the use of an energy - independent pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "also , the concept of momentum dependent scattering length is very useful for estimation of the interaction for a rydberg atom where it allows to take into account the effect of the coulomb potential of nucleus , see for example ref  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , much less is known in low - dimensional systems .",
    "indeed , only recently the universal terms of the 2d equation of state have been correctly derived@xcite and checked numerically @xcite . in the present study",
    "we address the problem of non - universal corrections in low - dimensional systems .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : a(k ) ] and confront that with numerical results .",
    "section  [ sec : non - universal terms ] is devoted to the study of non - universal effects in the @xmath0-wave scattering problem and in the many - body equation of state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the possibility of experimental observation of non - universal effects in trapped cold gases .",

    "in dilute systems the probability of three - body collisions is highly reduced leaving the two - body scattering the most important physical process . in this process",
    "two particles scatter each other with a relative momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the two - body scattering problem is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reduced mass . if the interaction potential @xmath9 is short - ranged , its exact shape is not important at low density and the relevant quantity of the scattering solution @xmath10 is the phase @xmath11 at distances larger than the range of the potential . for small scattering energies",
    "the phase can be expanded in terms of the momentum @xmath6 . in a 3d system",
    "this leads to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath0-wave scattering length and @xmath5 is the effective range .",
    "if the scattering momentum is very small the only relevant parameter is the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath13 and all potentials having the same value of @xmath13 will behave similarly .",
    "this limit is known as _",
    "universal regime_. the relevant length scales are then @xmath13 and the interparticle distance .",
    "it is expected that the many - body ground - state energy can be expressed in terms of the gas parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath4 denotes the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "for example , the low density energy per particle of a homogeneous weakly - interacting bose gas in 3d at zero temperature is given by @xmath15 with the leading term linear in the density being the mean - field gross - pitaevskii contribution@xcite and quantum fluctuations contributing to the subleading @xmath16 lee - huang - yang correction@xcite .",
    "the next term scales like @xmath17 , but it is no longer universal@xcite and depends on the explicit choice of the interaction potential .",
    "it is possible to recast the definition ( [ a1 ] ) of the scattering length @xmath13 in a different form , namely , as the position of the node of the analytic continuation of the scattering solution from distances much larger than the range of the potential in the zero - energy scattering limit .",
    "indeed , in 3d , in the limit of very low - scattering energy the phase reads @xmath18 and the scattering solution becomes @xmath19 , which has a node at @xmath20 .",
    "the advantage of the alternative definition is that it is well suited also to low - dimensional problems .",
    "we generalize the last definition to finite values of the scattering energy .",
    "the generalized scattering length @xmath21 is the position of the node of the analytical continuation of the large distance @xmath22 two - body scattering solution @xmath10 at the scattering energy @xmath23 .",
    "if there are several nodes , the position of the closest node to @xmath24 is considered.[def : a(k ) ]    in this way the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath21 depends on the scattering momentum and fulfills the condition @xmath25 .",
    "an example how the @xmath0-wave scattering length changes with the type of the potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] for several characteristic interactions in one dimension .",
    "the figure shows the asymptotic continuation of zero energy scattering solution .",
    "we will show in the next sections that the inclusion of the finite - momentum corrections improves the description of the energy and allows us to estimate the term of the expansion where the non - universal behavior appears .    at this point",
    "it is important to understand the relation between the effective range and the @xmath0-wave scattering length in the description of non - universal effects .",
    "the effective - range theory is well established in three - dimensional systems ( see , for example , textbook @xcite ) .",
    "the effective range is then defined from the expansion of the phase shift in terms of the scattering momentum , see eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the constant term defines the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath13 , and the effective range @xmath5 corresponds to taking into account dependence on @xmath26 . instead",
    ", the energy dependent @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath21 includes in addition all higher order momenta , i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , ... more importantly the concept of @xmath21 can be applied to low - dimensional systems , where the non - universal terms in the equation of state are not generally known . in our approach",
    "it is enough to know the dependence on @xmath13 of the universal equation of state and the non - universal terms will be automatically generated .",
    "one peculiarity of the one - dimensional world is that several many - body models can be solved _",
    "exactly _ ( with short- @xcite and long- @xcite range interactions ) , in the sense that the exact ground state can be written either explicitly@xcite or can be easily obtained as the solution of a system of integral equations @xcite .",
    "this allows us to test the proposed approach of using an energy dependent scattering length by comparing to the exactly known results .",
    "the ground - state energy of a bose gas with a repulsive @xmath29-pseudopotential interaction ( lieb - liniger model ) can be obtained by solving bethe _ ansatz _ equations .",
    "the expansion of the energy in the mean - field regime@xcite has a structure similar to that of the three - dimensional case ( [ e3d ] ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the one - dimensional coupling constant .",
    "indeed , the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ e1d ] ) is the same as it would come out from the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation , while the subleading term is the same as obtained from bogoliubov theory . in passing by",
    "we note that such a coincidence is not obvious _ a priori _ , as both the gross - pitaevskii and bogoliubov theories assume that all or a large fraction of particles are in the condensate . instead , strictly speaking , bose - einstein condensation in homogeneous one - dimensional system is absent@xcite .",
    "the reason why the theories based on the presence of a bose condensate produce correct results for energetic properties can be understood by following the similar arguments used in the renormalization group approach ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "the main contribution to the energy comes from short distances . at short distances",
    "the phase coherence may be present even in the absence of the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "therefore , on this length scale it is possible to apply the perturbative theories that are based on the assumptions of a macroscopic occupation of the condensate .",
    "coherence at finite distances larger than the interparticle distance is sufficient for mf and bogoliubov theories to yield correct result for the ground - state energy .",
    "in particular , such theories successfully describe one - dimensional systems at zero temperature ( such as lieb - liniger gas in the regime of weak correlations ) and two - dimensional dilute bose gas at finite temperature , none of which has true bose - einstein condensation . a mathematical way to resolve the paradox and to prove the validity of the bogoliubov result in one - dimensional systems is to use space discretization and to introduce the concept of a quasi - condensate@xcite .",
    "contrary to three- and two- dimensional systems , here the mean - field regime means high densities @xmath32 .",
    "this precludes us from using the concept of energy - dependent scattering length in the mf regime , as the energy of an incident particle would be huge , see eq .",
    "( [ e1d ] ) , and so would be the deviations of @xmath21 from @xmath13 . thus , the mean - field regime is no longer universal ( contrary to what happens in 3d and 2d systems ) , as the energy and correlation functions are very different for the @xmath29-pseudopotential @xcite , the calogero - sutherland @xmath33 potential @xcite and the dipolar @xmath34 interaction @xcite .",
    "instead , in the regime of strong quantum correlations , @xmath35 , the energy and correlation functions of all those models ( essentially , for any repulsive interaction potential ) approach the same _ universal _ limit referred as tonks - girardeau@xcite regime ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] ) .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the one - dimensional world that the dilute regime , @xmath36 corresponds not to a mean - field limit , but rather to a regime where quantum fluctuations are dominant .",
    "the energy in this limit is given by the energy of an ideal fermi gas @xmath37 and the wave function of strongly interacting bosons can be mapped onto a wave function of non - interacting fermions@xcite .",
    "for instance , the energy of a gas of hard rods of size @xmath38 is obtained from the energy of an ideal fermi gas by taking into account the excluded volume@xcite : @xmath39 .",
    "we expand this expression in terms of the one - dimensional gas parameter @xmath40 at small densities @xmath41 and get @xmath42    it is worth mentioning that the beyond - mean - field terms in three - dimensional systems were first obtained for a hard - sphere gas by lee , huang , yang@xcite and afterwards were shown to be universal@xcite .",

    "we argue that the universal equation of state is smooth as a function of the one - dimensional gas parameter @xmath50 .",
    "this is supported by the apparent similarities between the hard - rod gas and the gas - like state of the attractive @xmath29-pseudopotential ( `` super - tonks - girardeau '' system)@xcite .",

    "we find that the first three terms of the expansion are the same for considered potentials .",
    "the physical meaning of such terms is that particles behave as if they were ideal fermions in the box of size @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , this interpretation explicitly applies to the hard - rod gas , where the excluded volume correction is negative , as @xmath38 . for a negative scattering length the `` excluded volume ''",

    "the slope of @xmath10 is determined by the scattering momentum ( refer to eq .",

    "the scattering solution for a lieb - liniger hamiltonian can be `` adjusted '' to match the tonks - girardeau solution by the change @xmath59 ( mind that @xmath60 in this case ) .",
    "this makes natural that the `` excluded volume '' correction is encountered for different potentials and it can change its sign .",

    "there it was demonstrated that the dipoles crystalize at large densities .",
    "the density of the quantum phase transition turned out to be extremely large @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "this shows that dipolar interaction potential is rather `` soft '' compared to the hard - core potentials , which are expected to crystallize at values of the gas parameter smaller than unity ( for example , @xmath62 in the case of hard - disks @xcite ) .",
    "the equation of state of a dilute gas was obtained both in the universal and non - universal regimes from monte carlo calculations for dipoles @xcite , hard- and soft- disks @xcite .",
    "a peculiarity of the two - dimensional systems is that the gross - pitaevskii equation has a limited applicability even in very dilute systems @xcite due to the logarithmic dependence on the gas parameter rather than on powers of it , like in three- and one- dimensional systems .",
    "this means that it is extremely difficult to study numerically the universal equation of state .",
    "densities as low as @xmath63 had to be reached in calculations @xcite in order to check numerically the low - density expansion of the universal equation of state .",
    "it turns out that in order to describe correctly the beyond mean - field effects , several terms have to be summed even at densities as low as @xmath64 since the series comes out in terms of the slow converging logarithm function @xmath65 , which at such densities is of the order of the next ( constant ) term .",

    "the substitution of ( [ pseudopotetnial ] ) into the expression of the interaction energy written in first quantization simplifies the double integration @xmath70 . treating the field operator @xmath71 as a classical field and substituting it with the particle density @xmath72 one obtains the mean - field expression for the energy @xmath73    it is easy to see from eq .",

    "the energetic properties of trapped gases can be accessed by observing the frequencies of collective oscillations . by displacing the center of the trap it is possible to generate oscillations which depend only on the frequency of the trapping potential . instead , a sudden change in the frequency of the trap causes `` breathing '' oscillations , for which the frequency depends on the compressibility of the gas , which , in turn , is related to the equation of state .",
