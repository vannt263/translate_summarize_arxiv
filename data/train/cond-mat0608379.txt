    "neurons in a brain communicate information , emitting spikes which propagate through axons and dendrites to neurons at the next stage .",
    "it has been a long - standing controversy whether information of neurons is encoded in the firing rates ( _ rate code _ ) or in the more precise firing times ( _ temporal code _ ) @xcite .",
    "some experimental results having been reported seem to support the former code while some the latter @xcite .",
    "in particular , a recent success in brain - machine interface ( bmi ) @xcite@xcite suggests that the population rate code is employed in sensory and motor neurons while it is still not clear which code is adopted in higher - level cortical neurons .",
    "experimental observations have shown that in many areas of the brain , neurons are organized into groups of cells such as columns in the visual cortex @xcite . a small patch in cortex",
    "contains thousands of similar neurons , which receive inputs from the same patch and other patches .",
    "there are many theoretical studies on the property of neuronal ensembles consisting of equivalent neurons , with the use of spiking neuron models or rate - code models ( for a review on neuronal models , see @xcite ; related references therein ) . in the spiking neuron model , the dynamics of the membrane potential of a neuron in the ensemble",
    "is described by the hodgkin - huxley ( hh)-type nonlinear differential equations ( des ) @xcite which express the conductance - based mechanism for firings . reduced , simplified models such as the integrate - and - fire ( if ) and fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) models have been also employed .",
    "in contrast , in the rate - code model , neurons are regarded as transducers between input and output signals , both of which are expressed in terms of spiking rates .",
    "computational neuroscientists have tried to understand the property of ensemble neurons by using the two approaches : direct simulations ( dss ) and analytical approaches .",
    "ds calculations have been performed for large - scale networks mostly described by the simplest if model .",
    "since the computational time of ds grows as @xmath1 with @xmath0 , the size of the ensemble , a large - scale ds with more realistic models becomes difficult .",
    "although ds calculations provide us with useful insight to the firing activity of the ensemble , it is desirable to have results obtained by using analytical approaches .",
    "analytical or semi - analytical calculation methods for neuronal ensembles have been proposed by using the mean - field ( mf ) method @xcite , the population - density approaches @xcite-@xcite , the moment method @xcite and the augmented moment method ( amm ) @xcite ( details of the amm will be discussed shortly ) .",
    "it is interesting to analytically obtain the information of the firing rate or the interspike interval ( isi ) , starting from the spiking neuron model .",
    "it has been shown that the dynamics of the spiking neuron ensemble may be described by des of a macroscopic variable for the population density or spike activity , which determines the firing rate of ensemble neurons @xcite-@xcite . by using the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation between",
    "the applied dc current @xmath3 and the frequency @xmath2 of autonomous firings , the rate - code model for conduction - based neuron models is derived @xcite .",
    "when we apply the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) method to the neuron ensemble described by the if model , the averaged firing rate @xmath4 is expressed by @xmath5 which denotes the distribution probability of the averaged membrane potential @xmath6 with the threshold @xmath7 for the firing @xcite .",
    "it is well known that neurons in brains are subjected to various kinds of noise , though their precise origins are not well understood .",
    "the response of neurons to stimuli is expected to be modified by noise in various ways . indeed , although firings of a single _ in vitro _",
    "neuron are reported to be precise and reliable @xcite , those of _ in vivo _ neurons are quite unreliable due to noisy environment .",
    "the strong criticism against the temporal code is that it is not robust against noise , while the rate code is robust .",
    "it is commonly assumed that there are two types of noise : additive and multiplicative noise .",
    "the magnitude of the former is independent of the state of variable while that of the latter depends on its state .",
    "interesting phenomena caused by the two noise have been investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the property of multiplicative noise is different from that of additive noise in some respects .",
    "( 1 ) multiplicative noise induces a phase transition , creating an ordered state , while additive noise works to destroy the ordering @xcite@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) although the probability distribution in stochastic systems subjected to additive white noise follows a gaussian , multiplicative white noise generally yields a non - gaussian distribution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the scaling relation of the effective strength for additive noise given by @xmath8 is not applicable to that for multiplicative noise : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote effective strengths of multiplicative and additive noise , respectively , in the @xmath0-unit system @xcite . a naive approximation of the scaling relation for multiplicative noise : @xmath12 as adopted in ref .",

    "the amm in @xcite was originally developed by expanding variables around their stable mean values in order to obtain the second - order moments both for local and global variables in stochastic systems . in recent papers @xcite ,",

    "a study on the langevin model with multiplicative noise made in @xcite , has been applied to an investigation on the firing properties of neuronal ensembles .",

    "for a study of the property of a neuron ensemble containing finite @xmath0 neurons , we have assumed that the dynamics of the firing rate @xmath35 ( @xmath15 ) of a neuron @xmath16 ( @xmath17 to @xmath0 ) is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath20 are arbitrary functions of @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 denotes the coordination number , @xmath21 an input from external sources and @xmath43 the coupling strength : @xmath44 and @xmath22 express the strengths of additive and multiplicative noise , respectively , given by @xmath23 and @xmath45 expressing zero - mean gaussian white noise with correlations given by @xmath46 the rate model in eq .",

    "this is consistent with the recent calculation for hh neuron multilayers @xcite , which shows a nearly linear relationship between the input ( @xmath57 ) and output rates ( @xmath58 ) for @xmath59 hz ( fig . 3 of ref .",
