    "the recent mathematical theory of compressed sensing @xcite has been shown to be very promising in a number of areas as diverse as medicine @xcite , biomedicine @xcite , geophysics @xcite , radar @xcite , astronomy @xcite , or microscopy @xcite .",
    "most inverse problems in these areas are considered to be underdetermined , meaning that we do not have unique solutions and , therefore , it is apparently impossible to identify which one is indeed the correct one .",
    "what makes compressed sensing at once interesting is that , often , the sought solution is known to be structured in the sense that it is sparse or compressible , which means that it depends upon a small number of parameters",
    ". this additional information changes the imaging problem dramatically because we can exploit the sparsity of the image and look for the simplest one that tends to be the right one .    in this paper",
    ", we study narrow - band , active array imaging of a small number of localized scatterers using both single and multiple illuminations .",
    "the goal is to determine the positions and reflectivities of the scatterers from the echoes recorded at an array of sensors when a few narrow band signals are sent to probe the medium . by localized scatterers",
    "we mean scatterers whose diameter is small compared to the wavelength .",
    "hence , the foldy - lax approximation to the wave equation can be used to model wave propagation in the medium @xcite .",
    "the number of scatterers is small because only a small portion of the region of interest is occupied by scatterers and , thus , the image we wish to recover is sparse .",
    "we study the case in which the interaction between the scatterers is strong so that multiple scattering is important , and the case in which the interaction is small so that multiple scattering is negligible .",
    "we consider imaging in homogeneous media and imaging in randomly inhomogeneous media with significant scattering from the inhomogeneities .",
    "we restrict this study to the case in which the full waveform at the array is available for imaging , which means that in the frequency domain both amplitudes and phases can be measured and recorded . for the case in which the phases can not be recorded",
    "we refer to @xcite .    in this work we consider narrow - band array systems and ,",
    "therefore , the frequency diversity content of the data measured at the array is very limited .",
    "there is an extensive literature on imaging techniques that deal with this problem .",
    "kirchhoff migration @xcite , matched field imaging @xcite , and multiple signal classification ( music ) @xcite are among the most used techniques . as in narrow - band array imaging the data is scarce , and hence , there are infinitely many configurations of scatterers that match the data set , we formulate active array imaging as an optimization problem with constraints @xcite . when multiple scattering between the scatterers is important , the resulting problem is nonlinear , and therefore , it is apparently impossible to solve the optimization problem non - iteratively @xcite .",
    "we show , however , that the nonlinearity can be avoided through a two - step process that effectively linearizes the inverse problem . in the first step",
    ", we treat the scatterers as equivalent sources and we recover their locations and strengths . in the second step , once the locations of the scatterers are fixed , we recover their true reflectivities using a known relationship between the source strengths and the scatterer reflectivities .",
    "this is an explicit relation that comes from the foldy - lax equations , given the scatterer locations and the illumination .",
    "when multiple scattering is significant some scatterers may be obscured due to screening effects .",
    "therefore , not all the scatterers may be recovered from data generated by a single illumination .",
    "indeed , given an array illumination , multiple scattering may reduce the effective illumination at certain locations due to destructive interferences of secondary sources coming from all the scatterers . to mitigate this additional problem of multiple scattering ,",
    "we will discuss the use of multiple illuminations .",
    "the resulting optimization problem with multiple illuminations will be formulated as a joint sparsity recovery problem where we seek an unknown matrix whose columns share the same support .",
    "thus , we seek for solution vectors corresponding to different illuminations that have a common support but have possibly different nonzero values .",
    "the key point of the proposed two - step approach is the possibility of exact recovery of the locations of the equivalent sources in the first step .",
    "we give conditions on the array imaging setup and the measurement noise level under which the locations of the sources can be recovered exactly .",
    "the uniqueness and stability of the solution are analyzed , showing that the errors are proportional to the amount of noise in the data with a proportionality factor that depends on the sparsity of the solution and the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix @xcite .",
    "these conditions are given for general imaging configurations .",
    "conditions on the resolution of the images that guarantee exact recovery in the paraxial regime are derived in @xcite for scatterers whose range is known . a more general paraxial model with scatterers at different ranges from the array",
    "is considered in @xcite .",
    "the interesting case of imaging scatterers with small off - grid displacements are studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a simple perturbation method is proposed to reduce the gridding error for off - grid scatterers .",
    "the authors in @xcite also present a very nice discussion on how to interpret the results obtained with @xmath0 minimization when modeling errors due to off - grid displacements are significant .",
    "for the case in which multiple scattering can be ignored , we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the use of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the data matrix with @xmath0 minimization @xcite .",
    "we use the top right singular vectors of this matrix as illumination vectors to collect the data .",
    "then , we project the data onto the subspace spanned by the top left singular vectors to filter out the unnecessary data and the noise , and to reduce the dimension of the linear system . finally , @xmath0 optimization is applied to this reduced linear system to obtain the sparsest solution .",
    "this hybrid-@xmath0 method turns out to be very useful when imaging in random media .",
    "imaging in random media is fundamentally different from imaging in homogeneous or smoothly varying media . when the medium is inhomogeneous we know , at best , the large scale , but we can not known the small scale structure . hence , when the small structure of a medium is important we model it as a random spatial process . in these cases , it is essential to take into consideration the statistical stability of the images , which refers to the robustness of the imaging methods with respect to different realizations of the medium .",
    "in fact , many of the usual imaging methods used in homogeneous ( or smoothly varying ) media fail , even for broadband signals and large arrays , because the images become noisy and change unpredictably with the detailed features of the fluctuations of the medium .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the images obtained with kirchhoff migration that depend on the particular realization of the random medium , and thus , they become unstable .",
    "statistical stability typically holds only in broadband , we refer to @xcite for details . here , we consider narrow - band array systems .",
    "we show that , in these cases , large arrays are essential to stabilize the images when the medium is random . in particular , we show that the hybrid-@xmath0 method and music are efficient and robust when the arrays are large enough .",
    "we compare , using numerical simulations , the images obtained with these methods with those obtained with kirchhoff migration .",
    "the numerical simulations show that the hybrid-@xmath0 method becomes stable faster than music as the array size increases .",
    "kirchhoff migration is , as expected , unstable even for very large arrays .",
    "the analysis of imaging in random media is done using a relatively simple random phase model for the effects of the random medium .",
    "this model characterizes wave propagation in the high - frequency regime in random media with weak fluctuations and small correlation lengths compared to the wavelength .",
    "it is widely used , for example , in adaptive optics to compensate for rapidly changing distortions in the received wavefronts due to the atmospheric turbulence caused by changing temperature and wind conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the array imaging problem in homogeneous media when the multiple scattering is important . in  [ sec : homogeneous medium ] , we describe the optimization methods that determine the locations and reflectivities of scatterers using a two - step non - iterative approach , with and without multiple illuminations . in  [ sec : single scattering ] , we consider the case where multiple scattering is negligible , and we give a hybrid-@xmath0 method that improves the resolution of the image . in  [ sec : random medium ] , we consider imaging in random media . using the simple random phase model ,",
    "we show that the hybrid-@xmath0 and the music methods are statistically stable provided the arrays are large .",
    "the effectiveness of all the methods is illustrated in various numerical examples with comparisons to other imaging methods in each of the sections .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the proofs of the theoretical results are given in the appendix .",

    "however , by rearranging the terms in these equations , we can reformulate the problem to solve for the locations of scatterers directly , without any iteration , and then to recover the reflectivities of each scatterer in a second single step , as we explain next .",
    "the localization problem is by far much more difficult than the estimation of reflectivities , which is a straightforward inversion if the former is exact . to localize the scatterers without any iteration",

    "it is important to emphasize that due to the existence of multiple scattering , the solution of may not give all the support of @xmath39 .",
    "this is not a flaw of the new formulation , but an implicit problem of array imaging when multiple scattering is important .",
    "indeed , it is possible that one or several scalars @xmath59 , @xmath19 , are very small or even zero , and hence , the corresponding scatterers become dark .",
    "this is the well - known _ screening effect _ which makes scatterers undetectable , and that is manifested in our formulation making some components of the effective source vector @xmath64 arbitrarily small .",

    "the following theorem gives conditions under which recovers the positions and the strengths of the effective sources exactly if the data is noiseless .",
    "the proof follows that in @xcite .",
    "[ thm0 ] assume that the resolution of the iw is such that @xmath72 if the number of effective sources @xmath13 is such that @xmath73 , then @xmath74 is the unique solution to with support fully contained by that of @xmath39 .",
    "the condition of the sensing matrix @xmath75 is determined by the array imaging configuration .",
    "it is a measure of how linearly independent the columns of the sensing matrix are and it is related to the array geometry as shown in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that to prove the result in theorem [ thm0 ] , the condition has to be satisfied only on the support of @xmath76 .",
    "this means that if the distance between the effective sources is known a priori to be large so holds for the set of indices corresponding to its support , the discretization of the iw can be as small as we want .",

    "optimization ( or ) gives the effective source vector @xmath64 .",

    "imaging with a single illumination can be very sensitive to additive noise , especially when the noise level is high .",
    "moreover , the _ screening effect _ can cause the failure of recovering some of the scatterers",
    ". note that , for a fixed imaging configuration , the _ screening effect _ depends on the illumination vector @xmath43 and the amount of noise in the data . when the effective source at @xmath18 is below the noise level because @xmath59 is small",

    "this motives us to consider active array imaging with multiple illuminations . in this case ,",
    "active array imaging is modeled as a joint sparsity recovery problem , in which we seek for a matrix solution @xmath92 whose columns share the same support . by increasing the diversity of illuminations , we are able to minimize the _ screening effect _ and have higher chance of locating all the scatterers more stably .      instead of simply stacking multiple data vectors @xmath93 obtained from different illuminations @xmath48 , @xmath94 , and",
    "solving the corresponding augmented linear system as in  [ subsec : single illumination ] , we formulate the problem using the _ mmv _ approach where the unknown vectors @xmath95 corresponding to each illumination @xmath48 are arranged into a matrix .",
