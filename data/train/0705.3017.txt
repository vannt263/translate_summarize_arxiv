    "the problem of dark matter seems to be a challenge for theoretical and observational investigations .",
    "recent astronomical observations , like the measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by wmap @xcite , or measurements of distant supernova type ia ( snia ) @xcite , indicate that the universe , apart from matter , is fulfilled with a phenomenological fluid with negative pressure ( called dark energy ) which could be responsible for the current acceleration of the universe . while the nature of this energy is still unknown ( the cosmological constant @xmath2 is the most serious candidate ) ,",
    "the combination of results from cmb measurements , snia data and extragalactic observations indicate that as much as 2/3 of total energy density of the universe is in the form of the mysterious dark energy .",
    "while it dominates the dynamics of the universe on the large scale , dark matter ( matter whose existence has been inferred only through its gravity ) clearly influences the galactic scale dynamics .",
    "its abundance is given in terms of the density parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the critical energy density , @xmath5 .",
    "for the `` concordance '' flat @xmath2cdm model we have total matter @xmath6 ; in turn from emission and absorption of photons visible matter is roughly @xmath7 and it gives us that dark matter amounts to @xmath8 .",
    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies give us the strongest evidence for dark matter .",
    "this dark matter in its @xmath9 is in some form cold and nonbaryonic .",
    "therefore , we can identify only @xmath10 of the total matter content in the present universe . if we do not postulate the existence of dark matter it is not possible to explain why at large distance @xmath11 from the centre of a given galaxy , we would find circular velocity @xmath12 , since visible matter is concentrated around its centre .",
    "for the observational results of rotation curves see ref .",
    "however , observations show that @xmath13 is independent of @xmath11 at large distances ( @xmath14 km s@xmath15 is its typical value ) . from numerical simulations of the halo formation we obtain density profiles for both small and large values @xmath16 with @xmath17 for small and @xmath18 for large distances @xcite .",
    "the flat part of the rotation curves corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "such a behavior can be explained e.g. within the isothermal sphere model of dark matter halo . in this model",
    ", the constant value of the rotation velocity @xmath13 can be related with the velocity dispersion @xmath20 of the dark matter particles by @xmath21 .",
    "there are two main candidates for cold dark matter , namely the axion and neutralino @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the axion .",
    "axions were originally proposed to solve the strong cp problem in the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "if axions have low mass , thus preventing other decay modes , axion theories predict that the universe would be filled with cold bose - einstein condensate of primordial axions @xcite .",
    "the axions in this condensate are always nonrelativistic and if the mass is about @xmath22 ev it would plausibly explain the dark matter problem .",
    "there are prospects for direct experimental detection of axion .",
    "the axion dark matter experiment ( admx ) @xcite searches for weakly interacting axions in the dark matter halo of our galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , studies of axion dark matter are not sufficiently sensitive to probe the mass regions where axions would be expected .",
    "we investigate the possibility of explanation of flat velocity curves of spiral galaxies in terms of axion condensate which can be present in the universe since the peccei - quinn phase transition .",
    "in our investigation we use the gross - pitaevski equation in an expanding frw universe @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the external potential , @xmath25 is the coupling constant between axions and @xmath26 is the scale factor .",
    "here we describe the condensate by one particle wave function @xmath27 . the circulation in condensate",
    "is expressed by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an integer called topological charge .",
    "@xmath30 denotes any contour around a vortex .",
    "when there is no vortex , @xmath31 and the circulation vanishes . when the condensate is inside a rotating environment the vortex is formed . in the interacting condensate vortices with @xmath32",
    "are unstable and decay to the vortices with @xmath33 .",
    "so in a realistic situation we have a net of elementary vortices ( @xmath33 ) which are stable . such nets of vortices are observed in laboratories @xcite .",
    "we study the possibility that a galactic halo is just such a vortex .",
    "we suppose that such a mechanism can be realised in the early universe .",
    "namely , in the presence of global rotation , the proposed mechanism yields a huge amount of small vortices whose topological charges equal @xmath34 . in this paper",
    "we consider a singular vortex in the axion condensate .",
    "the question whether rotation is an attribute of the universe as a whole has been investigated since classical works of lanczos @xcite , gamov @xcite , godel @xcite , hawking @xcite and recently by chapline and mazur @xcite . when compared with the cmb anisotropies",
    ", the effects of rotation should not be big today @xcite .",
    "barrow et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the cosmic vorticity depends strongly on the cosmological model and for a flat universe the bound on vorticity relative to the hubble parameter at present is @xmath35 .",
    "the bose - einstein occurs when the ground state becomes occupied by the macroscopic number of particles .",
    "since each of these particles is in the same quantum state @xmath36 , the density of the condensate composed of the @xmath37 particles of mass @xmath38 can be expressed as follows @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the square modulus of the wave function can be observed just as the density distribution of the particles in the condensate .",
    "the condition for condensation to occur is that de broglie wavelength of the particles must be comparable with the inter - particles distances .",
    "the individual wavefunctions of the particles will overlap then .",
    "this requirement can be translated into the critical temperature @xmath40 below which the condensation starts . for @xmath41 phase space density occupation number",
    "becomes significant .",
    "it is also important to note that condensation does not occur for the photons ( and other massless particles ) because number of photons is not conserved .",
    "therefore during a cooling , the number photons can be e.g. absorbed by the environment and condensation does not take a place .",
    "the axion field can be regarded as massless at the temperatures @xmath42 gev . in turn , at the lower temperatures , @xmath43 gev , the axion field becomes massive due to the nonperturbative qcd effects .",
    "the oscillations of this field are interpreted as the massive axion particles .",
    "the axion mass can be expressed as follows @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy of @xmath46 symmetry breaking and creation of axions .",
    "this the @xmath45 is a free parameter , however its value is empirically constrained to @xmath47 gev this corresponds to the axion mass window @xmath48ev . in the subsequent part of the paper we restrict to the case",
    "@xmath49 gev what leads to @xmath50ev .",
    "because axions are massless ate the energies @xmath42 gev , the condensation can not take place until the universe cools down to @xmath51 gev . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the axion temperature is then much smaller than @xmath40 what allows for the bose - einstein condensation to occur .",
    "namely the temperature is of the order of the hubble expansion rate @xmath52 ev while @xmath53 gev .",
    "since the axions are very weakly coupled , they can be consider as a gas of free particles . therefore in the first approximation",
    "the axion condensate can be described by the gross - pitaevski equation ( [ g - p ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . however , in order to trace the thermalization of the bose - einstein condensate , the weak gravitational coupling between axions must be also taken into account . in this section",
    ", we neglect this coupling and consider the free axion condensate formed at the qcd epoch for @xmath51 gev .",
    "namely , when the axion acquired a mass and the conditions for the bose - einstein condensation were satisfied .    in this case",
    ", the free gross - pitaevski equation ( [ g - p ] ) takes the form @xmath56\\phi({\\bf r},t).\\ ] ] the general solution of this equation is in the form @xmath57 where @xmath30 is the normalization constant and @xmath58 .",
    "energy of the particle is defined as @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the spherical bessel function related to the ordinary one with @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the standard spherical harmonics .",
    "based on ( [ sol1 ] ) , the energy density of the axion condensate , composed of @xmath37 axions can be written as follows @xmath63 where @xmath38 is axion mass . as we see , during the cosmological evolution , the axion condensate is diluted as the ordinary dust matter , namely @xmath64 .    solution ( [ sol1 ] ) is non - normalisable , therefore the constant @xmath30 can not be directly evaluated . to obtain a normalizable solution we must introduce proper boundary conditions , for example @xmath65 for some @xmath66 .",
    "but it is not natural in our case , as our universe is filled homogeneously by the axion condensate .",
    "free axions should thus be described approximately by a non - normalisable waves with defined energies .",
    "accordingly , our solution describes an axion condensate with defined nonquantized energy .",
    "our main idea is that small vortices created in the early universe can grow during expansion of the universe . at the early stage ,",
    "the vortex is a quantum object but during expansion it can becomes a classical object .",
    "the expansion of the free condensate follows directly the expansion of the universe .",
    "this might not be a case for the self - interacting condensate .",
    "then , the interaction resists the expansion due to the cosmic expansion .",
    "when the quantum system is strongly bounded , it can be even not sensitive on the cosmic expansion .",
    "it is e.g. the case for the hydrogen atom which energy levels remain unaffected by the cosmic expansion . for the free condensate , the spatial part ( in coordinate variables ) decouples from the temporal dependence",
    ". therefore if the wavefunction has some characteristic scale , let say @xmath67 , the the corresponding physical scale will be accordingly @xmath68",
    ". therefore whole physical scales of the wavefunction will expand homogeneously . in order to find the value of this growth we have to determine the total expansion of the universe since the formation of axion condensate till now ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the axion condensate was formed at some @xmath70 what we take to be @xmath71 gev .",
    "the corresponding value of time is @xmath72 sec .",
    "based on this , we have @xmath73 where the @xmath74 ev is the energy scale of recombination and @xmath75 is the corresponding value of redshift .",
    "so if the present characteristics size of the axion wavefunction is of order of the galactic scale @xmath76 kpc , it corresponds to @xmath77 m at @xmath78 .",
    "let us examine firstly the case without the vortex , @xmath31 .",
    "the solution of gross - pitaevski equation is of the form @xmath79 this solution describes a spherically symmetrical halo with the density distribution @xmath80 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the density in the central region is given by @xmath81 we must remember that the coordinate @xmath11 in not a physical distance , which is @xmath82 . for a spherical distribution",
    "we calculate the velocity rotation curve from the relation @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mass function and is expressed as @xmath85 based on this , we find @xmath86 where @xmath87    figure  ( [ dist1 ] ) shows the velocity curve for axion condensate ( [ vr0 ] ) .",
    "we compare the theoretically predicted curves with the exemplary galactic rotation curves @xcite .",
    "@xmath88{cc } \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ngc3521.eps } &   \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ngc4536.eps }   \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ngc5055.eps }   & \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ngc3621.eps }    \\end{array}$ ]    this result describes the observed galaxy velocity curves quite well  we can see the characteristic change to a plateau in the rotation curves .",
    "this is not not seen for comparison with ngc3621 galaxy , however even in this case , the main observational features can be reproduced .",
    "kinetic energy of the axion particles is equal to @xmath89 , where @xmath20 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "based on this , the equations ( [ v00 ] ) and ( [ r00 ] ) can be rewritten to the following form @xmath90 therefore , based on the observationally determined values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the quantities @xmath93 and the product @xmath94 can be determined . however , the values of of @xmath38 and @xmath20 can not be determined independently . combining the above equations",
    ", we find the consistency relation for our model @xmath95 therefore , the energy density in the central region of the halo can be determined based on @xmath91 and @xmath92 determined form the observations .",
    "this quantity can be compared with the observational value determined independently .    the value of velocity dispersion of axions can be expressed in the following way @xmath96 this expressions comes from the assumption that the axion momenta at the time @xmath78 is comparable with the corresponding hobble factor .",
    "therefore @xmath97 , the factor @xmath98 is due to the cosmological redshift .",
    "the expression does not take into account the contribution due to gravitationally induced thermalization .",
    "the interactions between the axions are neglected here .",
    "based on this , the expression on the parameter @xmath91 takes the form @xmath99 based on this , the present value of @xmath91 is predicted to be @xmath100pc .",
    "this value is six orders of magnitude shorter than the typically observed value @xmath101 kpc .",
    "therefore in order explain the galactic rotation curves by the axion condensate , the velocity dispersion @xmath20 ( or the product @xmath20 if the mass is not fixed ) must be smaller than predicted from ( [ sigmaa ] ) .",
    "namely for @xmath101kpc , based on ( [ r0s ] ) with @xmath50ev , we find @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the dispersion of the axions velocities must be extremely low in order to explain the galactic halo in terms of the wavefunction of the axion condensate .",
    "this velocity is much smaller than this predicted from equation ( [ sigmaa ] ) .",
    "moreover , the additional velocity dispersion can be produced due the the gravitational interactions .",
    "therefore we conclude that , the axions of the mass order of @xmath50ev , can not form the quantum compact structures on the galactic scales .",
    "they can however form the structures on the smaller scales .    based on ( [ r0s ] )",
    "one can answer , what should be the mass of the axion - like particle necessary to produce the quantum condensate on the galactic scales . in order to answer this",
    "we have to assume some velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .",
    "if they thermalize due to the gravitational interactions , the velocity dispersion should be order of the radial velocity of the stars ( as in the isothermal sphere model ) . taking @xmath102 and @xmath101kpc we find @xmath103 the particle must me therefore ultra - light .",
    "the interpretation of this result is clear when we recognize the right side in equation ( [ r0s ] ) .",
    "it is just , up to the numerical factor , the de broglie wavelength @xmath104 of the axion - like particle .",
    "these wavelengths have to be of the galactic sizes in order to keep the coherence of the quantum system .",
    "otherwise the whole structure will disintegrate due to decoherence . here",
    "this condition naturally emerges .",
    "namely , the equation ( [ r0s ] ) can be rewritten into the form @xmath105 where the right side is of the order of galactic diameter .",
    "the similar results can be obtained considering the vortex solution with @xmath33 .",
    "the velocity curves also exhibit a plateau , like the solution with @xmath31 .",
    "the only difference is that we now have the angle dependence @xmath106 .",
    "this produces , like for each vertex solution , distortions from the spherical shape of a dark matter halo .",
    "the @xmath33 is a stable vortex configuration .",
    "taking @xmath107 we find the corresponding solution @xmath108 in similarity with the @xmath31 case we find the density distribution @xmath109 ^ 2}_{=j^2_1\\left(\\sqrt{\\lambda}r\\right ) } \\cos^2 \\theta.\\ ] ] we have used here the definition of @xmath93 introduced in the @xmath31 case .",
    "however here one can not interpret it as a density for @xmath110 , because now @xmath111 .",
    "note , that in the case considered , the density distribution strongly depends on the angle @xmath112 , namely @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , at the surface of galactic disc ( @xmath114 ) the density of dark matter halo vanishes . this dependence must be taken into account while calculating the corresponding velocity curves .",
    "in general , one should firstly calculate the surface density @xmath115 , integration density @xmath116 over the @xmath117-direction . defining @xmath118 as a physical radial variable on the surface @xmath119 we find @xmath120 we were however unable to compute this integral analytically . based on",
    "this one can derive the mass function @xmath121 and then the corresponding velocity curve @xmath122 since this method is rather not practical computationally , we can alternatively integrate over the angular part , then @xmath123 ^ 2.\\ ] ] with use of expression on @xmath124 ( without the factor @xmath125 , since we have already integrated over the solid angle ) and ( [ vel ] ) we find @xmath126+(r / r_0)^2+(r / r_0)\\sin(r / r_0 ) } , \\label{vl1}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath91 are defined in the same way as in the @xmath31 case . in fig . [ rvc ]",
    "we compare expression ( [ vl1 ] ) with the analogous function previously found in the @xmath31 case .     and @xmath31 .",
    "in both case , the velocity curves are flat , @xmath127 , for @xmath128.,width=302 ]    as we see there is no qualitative difference between the velocity curves for @xmath33 and @xmath31 . in both cases ,",
    "the velocity curves become flat , @xmath127 , for @xmath128 . in fig . [ 3521v ] we compare velocity curve ( [ vl1 ] ) with the exemplary galactic velocity curve .    ) for the axion condensate with @xmath33 compared with the observational data for the galaxy ngc 3521 . in general",
    ", we observe a good agreement between the theoretical curve and the observational data .",
    "the main difference is the first peak in the theoretical curve .",
    "the predicted radial velocity is at this point about @xmath129 higher than the observed value.,width=302 ]    the fit gives a qualitatively good explanation of the observational data . despite this , as we have discussed before , the quantum structure on the galactic scales can be formed only if the axion - like particle is extremely low .",
    "this results naturally apply for the case of single vertex considered in this section .",
    "the vortex in axion condensate can not forms on the galactic scales because the axion mass is to high .",
    "however , the vortices can be formed on the much smaller scales . as we have previously estimated , @xmath130pc , neglecting the gravitational interactions of the axion particles .",
    "such a small vortices can however give seed to the galaxy formation .",
    "they can also be a source of the angular momenta of the primordial galaxies .",
    "this possibility is an attractive subject for the further studies .",
    "therefore the concept of axion vortices can be still potentially useful in explaining formation of the galaxies .",
    "we have considered axion condensate as a candidate for dark matter in galactic halos .",
    "condensates in laboratories are known to exhibit vortices induced by rotation of the environment .",
    "such vortices are unstable and decay into states with the lowest angular momentum .",
    "we prolong this picture onto the entire universe whose global rotation might give rise to the rotation of particular galaxies .",
    "precisely , the total angular momenta can decay onto the elementary vortices , each with the same topological charge @xmath33 .",
    "we have considered the non - normalizable states of the axion condensate with @xmath31 and @xmath33(vortex ) .",
    "it was shown that these solutions leads to the flat velocity curves characterized by oscillations in a plateau region .",
    "there was no qualitative difference between the velocity curves obtained in these two cases .",
    "we have confronted the theoretical curves with the exemplary observational data .",
    "we found that the theoretical curves reproduce the observational data .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that we neglected contribution from the ordinary luminous matter . therefore obtained velocity curves give only the contribution form the dark matter halo .",
    "the contribution from the luminous matter can be important near the galactic center , but is secondary at the larger distances .",
    "therefore , the flatness of the velocity curves at @xmath128 will be conserved even in presence of this additional matter content .    in this paper",
    "we have restricted to the case of the free axion condensate",
    ". some tiny interaction can be interaction present due to the gravitational forces .",
    "these interaction can be in fact important from the perspective of thermalization of the axion condensate .",
    "it requires further numerical studies to take into account the gravitational interactions in the considered scenario .",
    "in particular , the axion condensate will not expand freely during the cosmological evolutions , as it was observed in case of the free axion condensate .",
    "another issue is that the axions have some velocity dispersion . because of this",
    ", the individual wavefunctions of the axions differ a bit , and the wavefunction of the condensate should be considered as a superposition @xmath131 where @xmath132 are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian .",
    "the function @xmath133 is the gauss - shaped function centered at @xmath134 and with the dispersion related to @xmath20 .",
    "this superposition of non - normalizable states will lead to the normalizable state @xmath135 .",
    "the considered model has however serious limitations if applied to axions .",
    "namely , the velocity dispersion of the axions must be much smaller that predicted from the theory .",
    "moreover , the gravitational interaction of the axion will lead to the velocity dispersion much higher than required to form the quantum vortex on the galactic scales .",
    "intuitively , the de broglie wavelength of axions is much smaller than the galactic scales .",
    "therefore the quantum condensate will not keep the coherence on such scales .",
    "however , it does not exclude the axions as dark matter particles forming the galactic halo .",
    "due to the gravitational interactions they thermalize and can be described by the model of isothermal sphere . in this case , the flat velocity curves are also explained , and the constant velocity of galaxies is related to the velocity dispersion of axions by the relation @xmath136 .",
    "the vortices in axion condensate can be however important in the process of the galaxy formation .",
    "namely they can give the initial conditions for the galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , they can be responsible for the initial angular moment .",
    "this may also explain why the masses of the spiral galaxies are similar and equal to @xmath137 .",
    "this can be possibly explained since all the vortices have the same topological charge @xmath33 , what is directly a quantum effect .",
    "therefore , initially , galaxies can grow on the independent vortices in the axion condensate .",
    "but later , when the accretion of matter ( including other axions ) proceed , the length of coherence of the individuals vortices became much smaller than the length of created gravitating structure .",
    "the vortices in the axion condensate can be therefore a seeds of the galaxies but have no important influence on them at the further stages .",
    "however , the idea that the vortices in the axion condensate could have something to do with the galaxy formation must me approved be the further investigations .",
    "alternatively , the coherent quantum structure as the vortices , can be formed on the galactic distances but only if the mass of the axion - like particles is extremely low , namely is of the order of @xmath1ev . in such a case",
    "the de broglie wavelength of these particles is comparable with the galactic sizes .",
    "this condition prevents the disintegration of the quantum system due to the lack of coherence between the different parts of the quantum galactic halo .",
    "concluding , the explanation of the galactic velocity curves presented in this paper can still holds , but only if the dark matter particles are ultra - light .",
    "the axions of this mass are however illicit .",
