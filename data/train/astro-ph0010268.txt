    "the high energy radiation from compact astrophysical objects is emitted by relativistic or semi - relativistic thermal and nonthermal leptons ( electrons and pairs ) via synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and compton processes , plus bound - bound and bound - free transitions of high - z elements .",
    "since compton scattering is a dominant radiation mechanism in this regime , the most efficient and accurate method to model the transport of high energy radiation is the monte carlo ( mc ) technique . during the past decade",
    "we have developed a versatile state - of - the - art space - and - time - dependent mc code to model the radiative output of compact objects ( see e.g. liang et al .",
    "recently we have added the self - consistent evolution of the leptons using a fokker - planck scheme . the lepton evolution",
    "is then coupled to the photon transport .",
    "since this is the first time that we report on results obtained with this code , the first part of the present paper is devoted to a detailed description of the capabilities of the code (  2 ) and its verification in comparison with previous work (  3 ) .    in the second part of this paper (  4 ) , we apply this coupled mc - fp code to the study of the reprocessing of blackbody radiation from a magnetized neutron star surface by a magnetized spherical shell at the alfvn radius . recent observations of weak - field neutron star binaries , such as low - luminosity , x - ray bursters ( atoll sources , e.g. , 4u  1608 - 522 : @xcite , 4u  1705 - 44 : @xcite ) , bursting soft x - ray transients ( e.g. , aql  x-1 : @xcite ) , or pulsar binary systems ( e.g. , psr  b1259 - 63 : @xcite ) indicate that many of them exhibit soft ( photon index @xmath0 ) power law tails extending beyond @xmath1  kev , at least episodically , in addition to the thermal component at temperatures of @xmath2  a few kev , which presumably originates from the stellar surface .",
    "the luminosity of this high - energy tail appears to be anti - correlated with the soft x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of this high energy tail is unexplained at present",
    ". it could be due to thermal comptonization by a hot coronal plasma , or it could be due to nonthermal emission .",
    "tavani and liang ( 1996 ) examined systematically the possible sites of nonthermal emissions and concluded that the alfvn surface is the most likely candidate since the dissipation of the rotation energy of the disk is strongest there , due to magnetic reconnection and wave turbulence generation . here",
    "we first focus on particle acceleration by wave turbulence .    because of the 1-d nature of our code at this stage",
    ", the neutron star is assumed to emit isotropic blackbody radiation , the reprocessing magnetospheric plasma is idealized as part of a spherical shell at the alfvn radius , and the magnetic field is taken to be nondirectional , so that the radiation output is isotropic . even though this is not a perfect representation of a quasi - dipolar magnetosphere and accretion flow ,",
    "we believe that , except for very special viewing angles , our output spectra should be a reasonable approximation to the angle - averaged output of the reprocessing by a hybrid thermal / nonthermal magnetosphere .",
    "we assume that the leptons are energized by coulomb collisions with virial ions and accelerated nonthermally by alfvn and whistler wave turbulence , and cooled by cyclotron / synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse comptonization of both internal soft photons and blackbody photons from the stellar surface .",
    "the primary focus of the parameter study presented in  4 is the application to weakly magnetized neutron stars with surface magnetic fields of @xmath3  g. in particular , we will show that the anti - correlation of the hardness and luminosity of the hard x - ray emission with the soft x - ray luminosity is a natural consequence of the energetics of particle acceleration and cooling near the alfvn radius .",
    "we predict that the nonthermal tails in the hard x - ray spectra of accreting , weakly magnetized neutron stars may extend up to @xmath4  mev . a solid detection and the measurement of the cutoff energy of these high - energy tails by the integral mission , scheduled for launch in 2002 , will provide important constraints on accretion - based models for the hard x - ray emission from accreting neutron stars .    in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that chatterjee , hernquist , & narayan ( 2000 ; see also @xcite ) have recently proposed a similar type of accretion - powered emission for anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , as an alternative to models based on magnetic - field decay ( @xcite ) or residual thermal energy ( @xcite ) . according to chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) the x - ray emission from axps ( which generally consists of a soft , thermal component with @xmath5  0.4  kev plus a hard x - ray tail with photon index @xmath6",
    " 4 ) is powered by accretion of material from the debris of the supernova which had formed the neutron star , onto a the surface of the neutron star , which possesses a typical pulsar magnetic field of @xmath7  g. therefore , we extend our parameter study to parameter values relevant to accreting pulsars .",
    "however , we point out that in the case of a magnetic field as high as @xmath8  g , the assumed shell geometry and the quasi - isotropy of the emission from the neutron star surface may be a gross over - simplification . however , although consequently the precise parameter values used in this region of the parameter space should not be taken at face value , our parameter study might still provide interesting insight into the dependence of the equilibrium electron and photon spectra on the various input parameters in the high - magnetic - field case .",
    "we use the monte carlo ( mc ) technique ( podznyakov , sobol , & sunyaev 1983 ; canfield , howard , & liang 1987 ; @xcite ; hua , kazanas , & titarchuk 1997 ) to simulate relativistic photon transport .",
    "we include the full ( energy - and - angle - dependent ) klein - nishina cross section for comptonization , relativistic bremsstrahlung from lepton - ion and lepton - lepton scattering ( @xcite ) , and cyclo - synchrotron processes ( @xcite ) in magnetic fields .",
    "the mc photon transport is fully space - and - time - dependent .",
    "photons are born with a certain `` weight '' ( which is basically the total energy in photons within a spatial region or emitted from a photon source , divided by the number of monte - carlo particles ) which is diminished by absorption and escape , until the weight drops below a user - specified limit , at which point the photon is `` killed '' . in the simulations shown later in the paper , we specify this energy weight cutoff as 1/100 of the initial statistical weight of the photon .",
    "the final results are insensitive to the choice of this energy weight cutoff , as long as it is @xmath9 .",
    "surviving photons are sampled at boundaries to provide time - and - frequency - dependent spectral output .",
    "in addition to self - emitted photons from the plasma , soft photons can be injected at zone boundaries and inside volume elements .",
    "currently the code can handle 1-d spherical , cylindrical or slab geometries with an arbitrary number of spatial zones .",
    "however since the photon ray tracing is done with full angle informations , the generalization to 2-and-3-d transport is straight forward .",
    "the maximum number of photon frequency bins is 128 . for more details of this code",
    "see canfield et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and bttcher & liang ( 1998 ) .",
    "a typical mc run with a million particles at a thomson depth of a few takes 10s of minutes on a dec alpha server . since the cpu time usage scales as the square of the thomson depth (  number of scatterings )",
    ", thomson thick runs can be quite time consuming .",
    "we are currently developing a random walk scheme for wien photons trapped in thomson thick zones , which would save large amounts of cpu time without introducing too much error .",
    "the lepton population is computed locally in each spatial zone using the fokker - planck approximation ( dermer , miller , & li 1996 ; li , kusunose & liang 1996a ) , taking into account coulomb and moller scattering , stochastic acceleration by alfvn and whistler wave turbulence , and radiative cooling ( plus pair processes if necessary ) .",
    "in general the lepton population consists of a low energy thermal population plus a high - energy tail truncated at the highest energies by radiative cooling .",
    "the photon and lepton evolutions are coupled to each other via a quasi - implicit time scheme in which we use an average of the photon - electron energy exchange rates between two subsequent time steps to compute the electron cooling rates , in particular due to compton scattering .",
    "the fokker - planck equation governing the electron evolution is solved using a fully implicit scheme .",
    "in contrast to several other codes currently used in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , we solve the evolution of the entire electron population with the fp scheme and do not introduce any artificial separation between thermal and non - thermal particles . since the lepton distribution typically evolves much faster than the photon distribution , each photon cycle contains many lepton cycles .",
    "the user , however , can always turn off the nonthermal lepton acceleration and assume a strict thermal population whose temperature can be computed self - consistently from energy balance alone .    in oder to calculate the emissivities and opacities for thermal cyclotron , non - thermal synchrotron , and thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( and only for this purpose ) , the electron distribution calculated with our fokker - planck scheme is decomposed into a thermal population plus a non - thermal tail .",
    "for the thermal bremsstrahlung and non - thermal synchrotron emission and absorption , the standard expressions from rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) are used . for the thermal cyclotron emission ,",
    "we add explicitly over the first 5 harmonics , beyond which we use the asymptotic continuum representation of mahadevan , narayan & yi ( 1996 ) .",
    "since in many cases of interest to the current investigation the moderately to strongly magnetized coronal plasma is optically thick at low frequencies , @xmath10  kev , due to synchrotron-(self-)absorption , we use the following simplification in order to save cpu time : for any given frequency @xmath11  kev , we compare the absorption length @xmath12 to the compton mean free path , @xmath13 and the radial extent @xmath14 of the current zone of the comptonizing region .",
    "if    @xmath15    any soft photon produced at this frequency has a very small probability of escaping the current zone or being up - scattered ( to a frequency at which the absorption length will be different so that the above criterion has to be re - evaluated after the scattering event ) before being re - absorbed .",
    "thus , in the frequency ranges where eq .",
    "( [ abs_length ] ) is fullfilled , the radiation escaping at the boundary of that zone will be approximately given by the respective section of the thermal blackbody spectrum .",
    "accordingly , our code neglects the volume emissivities in those frequency ranges and , instead , produces thermal blackbody photons at the zone boundaries .    during each photon time step",
    ", the code keeps track of the energy transferred between photons and electrons due to compton scattering and cyclotron / synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission and absorption .",
    "the respective heating and cooling rates are used to scale the energy loss / gain coefficients of electrons at a given energy @xmath16 . for the bremsstrahlung energy loss rate",
    ", we use the approximate scaling law @xmath17 ( bttcher , pohl , & schlickeiser 1999 ) .",
    "coulomb heating / cooling is included using the energy exchange and dispersion rates given in dermer & liang ( 1989 ) .",
    "we assume that the ions have a pre - specified temperature @xmath18  mev , which is not significantly affected by any changes of the electron temperature .",
    "for the energy exchange due to mller scattering ( elastic electron - electron scattering ) we use the electron energy exchange and dispersion coefficients given in nayakshin & melia ( 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to coulomb interactions and radiative losses , we also account for stochastic ( 2@xmath19 order fermi ) acceleration due to alfvn and whistler waves . for a given background magnetic field @xmath20 , the magnitude and spectrum of hydromagnetic plasma wave turbulences",
    "are determined by the parameters @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the amplitude of the magnetic - field fluctuations , and @xmath23 , the spectral index of the turbulence spectrum .",
    "we will generally use @xmath24 , characteristic of kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the electron acceleration and energy dispersion rates are calculated using the formalism of schlickeiser ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , we have to take into account that those plasma waves interacting efficiently with the low - energy , quasi - thermal part of the electron spectrum will be efficiently damped and absorbed by the process of landau damping ( e.g. , schlickeiser , fichtner & kneller 1996 ) .",
    "this leads to a strong truncation of the kolmogorov wave spectrum above a critical wave number for which the equivalent absorption depth through the region occupied by the hot plasma exceeds unity .",
    "we take the effect of landau damping into account by introducing an effective absorption depth @xmath25 at wave number @xmath26 , and correcting the acceleration rate @xmath27 of schlickeiser ( 1989 ) due to the `` optically thin '' plasma wave spectrum by an absorption term :    @xmath28    here @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the landau damping rate at wave number @xmath31 at which alfvn waves are resonating preferentially with electrons of energy @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the alfvn crossing time of the zone .",
    "this modified acceleration term can be renormalized either to correspond to the pre - specified value of @xmath34 for electrons resonating with waves in the weakly damped part of the alfvn wave spectrum ( i.e. at high electron energies ) , or by specifying a heat input rate into the electron ensemble due to resonant wave / particle interactions .    as an option ,",
    "our code can account for pair production and annihilation and the corresponding photon absorption and emission .",
    "the pair annihilation rates and annihilation radiation emissivities are taken from svensson ( 1982 ) , and the @xmath35 pair production rate of bttcher & schlickeiser ( 1997 ) is used .",
    "in addition , simple compton reflection schemes , using the green s functions for reflection off neutral disk material of white , lightman & zdziarski ( 1988 ) and lightman & white ( 1988 ) , can be used to simulate a compton reflection component either off the inner boundary ( corresponding to a quasi - homogeneous slab geometry ) or reflecting part of the radiation escaping at the outer boundary ( e.g. , corresponding to a cold outer disk ) .    assuming local isotropy of the electron distribution",

    "all other coefficients evolve sufficiently slowly ( i.e. on time scales much longer than the electron - evolution time scale ) so that the coefficients evaluated under the conditions at the beginning of the current time step can be used .    the implicit scheme of eq .",
    "[ discrete ] is known to approach the equilibrium solution for the electron distribution exactly , although the temporal evolution calculated this way becomes inaccurate on short time scales . since in the problems of interest here ,",
    "the electron distributions typically evolve on timescales much shorter than the photon distributions , the electrons always attain a distribution close to local equilibrium during each photon time step .",
    "hence , the degree of accuracy provided by the implicit scheme is sufficient for our purposes . as an option",
    ", the code can perform the same simulations using an explicit scheme to solve the fokker - planck equation . in all test cases , both schemes produced virtually identical results , but the implicit scheme executes a factor of @xmath51  100 faster because of the larger individual fokker - planck time steps allowed in this scheme .",
    "however , we did not find an appropriate method to calculate the coefficients for the pair production and annihilation rates at time step @xmath52 .",
    "for this reason , we have to correct the electron and positron distribution functions for pair production and annihilation in an explicit manner .",
    "this becomes obviously inaccurate in the case of strongly pair producing model situations .",

    "the convergence of the electron and photon spectra can be greatly accelerated if one starts out with an appropriate first guess for the equilibrium electron temperature .",
    "for this reason , we have developed an analytical estimate of the equilibrium electron temperature , which is described in appendix a. this analytical estimate is implemented in our code and can be used to determine the appropriate initial conditions for our equilibrium simulations .",

    "we have verified that in cases in which radiative cooling and hydromagnetic acceleration are inefficient , our fokker - planck scheme correctly produces a thermal electron distribution in temperature equilibrium with the protons .    in the analysis of coronal energy and radiation transfer , it is customary to paramatrize energy input and dissipation rates @xmath57 [ ergs  @xmath58  s@xmath59 by the dimensionless compactness , @xmath60 , which in spherical geometry , is defined by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the radius of the spherical volume . in slab geometry",

    "obviously , the resulting compactness will depend not only on the energy density in protons and magnetic turbulence , but also on the current electron distribution ( i.e. temperature , if the distribution is predominantly thermal ) , and can thus not be specified a priori as a free parameter . for comparison with previous work , we need to find appropriate values of the ion temperature and the wave turbulence amplitude in order to reproduce the dissipation compactness quoted in those papers .",
    "we define the temperature corresponding to the electron spectrum resulting from our simulations by requiring that the average electron lorentz factor , @xmath66 , be equal to the average lorentz factor of a thermal electron population of the respective temperature ,    @xmath67    to test our energy balance calculations , we have performed a series of simulations to reproduce the results of the slab corona model of dove et al .",

    "the latter simplification is justified by the argument that at low electron energies the thermalization time scale is much shorter than any other relevant time scale , and that long - wavelength plasma waves , with which low - energy electrons resonate preferentially , are strongly damped and in energy elequilibrium with the thermal pool of electrons . in our simulations , both effects are taken into account self - consistently without making the a - priori assumption of the existence or development of a non - thermal population .",

    "this reduction of the soft photon compactness leads to an increasing equilibrium electron temperature in the accretion shell .",
    "consequently , as the accretion rate decreases , the photon spectra change in the following way : for @xmath121 , the hard x - ray spectrum smoothly connects to the peak of the thermal blackbody bump from the neutron star surface , and shows a quasi - exponential cutoff at high energies . for lower @xmath116 , the spectrum turns into a typical low - hard state spectrum of x - ray binaries with the thermal bump clearly distinguished from a hard power - law + exponential cutoff at high energies .",

    "nonthermal tails in the electron spectra become more pronounced with increasing neutron star magnetic moment . for the weak - field case with @xmath123 ,",
    "we find that the high - energy end of the electron spectra are always truncated with respect to a thermal distribution due to strong compton losses , rather than developing a non - thermal tail .    at very low accretion rates , resulting in very low proton and electron densities in the accretion shell",
    ", we find that even at low turbulence level the heating due to stochastic acceleration strongly dominates over coulomb heating .",
    "consequently , the resulting electron spectrum becomes strongly non - thermal .",
    "we need to point out that in those cases , our treatment is no longer self - consistent since in our code the attenuation of alfvn waves is calculated under the assumption that it is dominated by landau damping in a thermal background plasma .",
    "the results illustrated in figs . [ fig_delta0_mu_3 ] and [ fig_mu_3 ] are in excellent agreement with the general trend ( @xcite ) that hard tails in lmxbs and soft x - ray transients containing weakly magnetized neutron stars are only observed during episodes of low soft - x - ray luminosity . while at large soft - x - ray luminosity , the x - ray emission out to @xmath127  kev is dominated by the thermal component from the neutron star surface and the hard tail is very soft with a low cut - off energy at @xmath128  kev , in lower - luminosity states the hard x - ray tail becomes very pronounced with photon indices @xmath129  3 and extends out to @xmath130  mev .",
    "dedicated deep observations by the upcoming integral mission should be able to detect this hard x - ray emission from neutron - star - binary soft x - ray transients and atoll sources in both high and low soft - x - ray states and thus provide a critical test of this type of accretion model for weakly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "interestingly , a similar anti - correlation of the hard x - ray spectral hardness with the soft x - ray luminosity seems to exist for high surface magnetic fields ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_delta0 ] and [ fig_mu1 ] ) only in the case of very low accretion rates ( @xmath131 ) and rather high magnetic turbulence levels ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray spectral indices resulting from our simulations are in excellent agreement with the values of @xmath6  4 generally observed in anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "this may provide additional support for accretion - powered emission models for axps .",
    "our simulations predict cutoff energies of @xmath133  500  kev .",
    "we have reported on the development of a new , time - dependent code for radiation transport and particle dynamics .",
    "the radiation transport , accounting for compton scattering , bremsstrahlung emission and absorption , cyclotron and synchrotron emission and absorption , and pair processes , is done using a monte - carlo method , while the electron dynamics , including radiative cooling , compton heating / cooling , and stochastic acceleration by resonant interaction with alfvn / whistler wave turbulence , are calculated using an implicit fokker - planck scheme , coupled to the monte - carlo radiation transfer code .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we have applied our code to the static situation of a shell at the alfvn radius of a magnetized neutron star .",
    "this situation is representative for accretion onto weakly magnetized neutron stars ( bursting atoll sources or soft x - ray transients containing wekaly magnetized neutron stars ) as well as to recently suggested models of accretion - powered emission from anomalous x - ray pulsars .",
    "the main results of our parameter study are :    \\(1 ) the lepton thermal temperature increases , and the hard x - ray photon spectrum becomes harder as the accretion rate is decreasing . at the same time , the normalization of the hard x - ray power - law , relative to the thermal blackbody from the neutron star surface , becomes smaller .",
    "\\(2 ) the nonthermal tails in the electron and photon spectra become more dominant and harder as the turbulence level is increasing . at the same time , the quasi - thermal electron temperature decreases , leading to a softer hard - x - ray spectrum .",
    "\\(3 ) for low accretion rates ( @xmath72  a few % ) , the photon spectra are only very weakly dependent on the magnetic moment of the neutron star . for higher accretion rates , an increasing neutron star magnetic moment leads to a moderate hardening of the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the non - detection of hard x - ray tails during soft x - ray high states of systems containing weakly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "however , we predict that a hard x - ray excess beyond @xmath134  kev should exist even in the high / outburst state . this excess should have a cutoff energy of @xmath133  200  kev . in the low / quiescent state ,",
    "the predicted spectral indices of @xmath135  3 are in excellent agreement witht he observed hard x - ray excesses observed from sources believed to contain weakly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "we predict that these spectra should extend out to @xmath130  mev .",
    "in the strong - field case , representative of a recently suggested model for anomalous x - ray pulsars , we expect a strong correlation between the hard x - ray spectral hardness and the soft x - ray luminosity only in the case of very low accretion rates and high magnetic turbulence level .",
    "the predicted hard x - ray spectral indices are generally in very good agreement with the observed values of @xmath6  4 .",
    "cutoff energies of @xmath133 ",
    "500  kev are predicted .",
    "dedicated , deep observations by the upcoming integral mission should be able to establish the existence of the hard power - law tails predicted in the models discussed here , and to constrain the high - energy cutoff of these tails .",
    "these measurements will be essential ingredients for a more detailed modeling of the physical conditions governing the accretion onto magnetized neutron stars .",
    "the code outlined above can be used for equilibrium situations by simply letting it evolve until both the photon and electron distributions have relaxed to a steady state . in order to provide a consistency test of our numerical methods ,",
    "we compute a quasi - analytical estimate for the expected equilibrium electron temperature . in our equilibrium simulations",
    ", we use this estimated equilibrium temperature as initial condition in order to accelerate the convergence .",
    "the photon energy density @xmath148 is calculated iteratively from the contributions of the various soft photon fields , and repeated compton scatterings : assume that the soft photon energy density @xmath149 ( sycnhrotron + bremsstrahlung + external radiation field ) is centered around a soft photon energy @xmath150 , and that @xmath151 . the average energy change of a photon with mean photon energy @xmath152 ( compton scattered @xmath26 times ) changes on average by a factor @xmath153 in the course of the @xmath154 . scattering .",
    "then , the total internal photon energy density is        in the cases we are interested in , the bremsstrahlung photon input will be negligible compared to cyclotron / synchrotron and the external soft photon fields .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath158 with @xmath159 and @xmath160 the photon energy @xmath150 is @xmath161 if @xmath162 , or @xmath163 else , where @xmath164 ."
