    "four dimensional quaternion algebra is defined by w. r. hamilton in 1843 . after the definition of quaternion algebra , j. t. graves asked hamilton about higher dimensional algebras .",
    "he tried to define eight and sixteen dimensional algebras , but graves encountered zero divisors on sixteen dimensional algebra . because of zero divisors , graves defined only eight dimensional real octonion algebra in 1843 . besides graves definition , a. cayley defined also octonions in 1845 . for detailed knowledge reader referred to [ 2 ] .",
    "octonion algebra is eight dimensional , non - commutative , non - associative and normed division algebra .",
    "this algebra is used in various physical problems such as ; supersymmetry , super gravity and super strings . in addition octonions",
    "are used in many subjects such as , unified fields of dyons and gravito - dyons , electrodynamic , electromagnetism . for background",
    "the reader can find their properties in [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .",
    "+   + the octonion algebra @xmath0 form an eight - dimensional real algebra with a basis @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "addition operation is component - wise and multiplication operation of base elements can be made by cayley - dickson process with quaternions or fano plane or multiplication table . for detailed information ,",
    "see [ 2 ] . +   + now , we give some fundamental definitions for the octonion algebra .",
    "let @xmath3 be any octonion , i.e ; @xmath4 where @xmath5 are base elements .",
    "conjugate of any octonion @xmath3 can be defined as @xmath6 one can easily see that the conjugate of an octonion @xmath3 is an involution of first kind [ 19 ] . with the help of the conjugate , norm of an octonion @xmath3",
    "can be defined as follows , @xmath7 to reader who wants to make further readings on octonions , we refer to [ 2 , 7 , 20 ] .",
    "+   + one can find many studies involving sequences with positive integers which satisfy a recursive relation in the literature . and",
    "many paper are dedicated to fibonacci sequences and their generalization .",
    "+ in this study we generalize fibonacci octonions and we investigate their fundamental properties . in first section ,",
    "we give definition of octonions . in second section , we give definition of horadam numbers which is generalization of fibonacci numbers . in third section , we introduce horadam octonions which contains fibonacci , lucas , pell , jacobsthal and all other second order sequences . for this newly defined sequence",
    "we give the generating function , norm value , cassini identity , a summation formula . as we give identities and properties mentioned above we present connections to earlier studies .",
    "the famous fibonacci numbers are second order recursive relation and used in various disciplines . some lesser known second order recursive relations are lucas numbers , pell numbers , jacobsthal numbers , etc .. many mathematicians tried to generalize these second order recursive relations .",
    "then horadam generalized these relations and this generalization is named as horadam sequence .",
    "horadam sequences are firstly defined for generalization of fibonacci and lucas recurrences as @xmath8 in [ 13 ] and this version of horadam numbers studied by koshy in [ 18 ] .",
    "then this definition is altered such that it includes other integer sequences like jacobstal numbers .",
    "we note that there are many identities and properties about horadam sequence [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] .",
    "+   + now , let us recall the definition of horadam numbers . in [ 15 ] ,",
    "horadam numbers are defined as + @xmath9 where @xmath10 are integers .",
    "let us give four important properties that are needed .",
    "firstly , binet formula of horadam sequence can be calculated using its characteristic equation .",
    "the roots of characteristic equation are @xmath11 using these roots and the recurrence relation binet formula can be given as follows @xmath12 secondly , the generating function for horadam numbers is @xmath13 thirdly , the cassini identity for horadam numbers is @xmath14",
    "lastly , a summation formula for horadam numbers is @xmath15 horadam firstly defined horadam numbers on @xmath16 and then defined horadam numbers on @xmath17 and @xmath18 [ 14 ] . in addition , halici gave a very complete survey about horadam quaternions in [ 9 ] .",
    "+ more recently octonions have been studied by many authors .",
    "for example , the fibonacci octonions , pell octonions and modified pell octonions appeared in [ 3 , 17 , 22 ] .",
    "there are many studies about fibonacci numbers over dual octonions and generalized octonions [ 11 , 21 , 23 ] . also , some representations of fibonacci octonions are considered , for example see [ 12 ] . + in the next section we define a new octonion sequence with horadam components which is generalization of earlier studies , for example , see [ 3 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 21 , 22 , 23 ] .",
    "and then we give some fundamental properties and identities related with this sequences .",
    "in this section we introduce horadam octonions .",
    "horadam octonions are octonions with coefficients from horadam sequence and we inspired the idea from [ 9 ] . in [ 9 ] , author studied binet formula , generating function , cassini identity , summation formula and norm value for horadam quaternions .",
    "similarly we define horadam octonions and we investigate binet formula , generating function , cassini identity , summation formula and norm value for horadam octonions .",
    "horadam octonions can be shown as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 as in equation @xmath21 . because of its coefficients this new octonion can be called horadam octonion . after some necessary calculations we acquire the following recurrence relation ; @xmath22 in this section we give binet formula , generating function , cassini identities , summation and norm of these octonions .",
    "binet formula is very useful for finding desired horadam octonion and this formula takes part at many theorems proof .",
    "+ the cassini identity yields many fascinating by - products and this formula is used to establish interesting results concerning with some sequences .",
    "+    the binet formula for horadam octonions is + @xmath23 + where @xmath24 and @xmath25    binet formula for horadam octonions can be calculated similar to binet formula for horadam sequence . by using characteristic equation @xmath26 the roots of characteristic equation",
    "is @xmath11 using these roots and the recurrence relation binet formula can be written as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28    in the binet formula of horadam octonions if we take @xmath29 and calculating the value of @xmath30 then we have @xmath31 + @xmath32 we should note that the equation @xmath33 is binet formula of modified pell octonions which is given by catarino in [ 3 ] . also , if we take @xmath34 and calculate the value @xmath30 with respect to its recurrence relation , we have binet formula for fibonacci octonions which is given by keiliolu and akku in [ 17 ] .",
    "+ in the following theorem we give the generating function for horadam octonions .",
    "the generating function for horadam octonions is + @xmath35    to prove this claim , firstly , we need to write generating function for horadam octonions ; @xmath36 + secondly , we need to calculate @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the following equations ; + @xmath39 + finally , if we made necessary calculations , then we get the following equation + @xmath40which is the generating function for horadam octonions    using the initial values for modified pell octonions and the equation @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42 in fact the formula @xmath43 is the generating function for modified pell octonions given by catarino in [ 3 ] .",
    "in addition if we take initial values of fibonacci octonions and calculate equation @xmath41 accordingly then we get generating function for fibonacci octonions .",
    "so , generating function for horadam octonions generalizes fibonacci octonions , lucas , octonions , modified pell octonions , etc .. +   + in the following theorem , we state two different cassini identities which occur from non - commutativity of octonion multiplication . +    for horadam octonions the cassini formulas are as follows @xmath44 @xmath45    we use binet formula in order to prove equation @xmath46 + @xmath47@xmath48 + if necessary calculations are made , we obtain + @xmath49 + which is desired . in a similar way ,",
    "the equation @xmath50 can be easily obtain .",
    "cassini identities are studied for fibonacci octonions in [ 12 , 17 ] and for modified pell octonions in [ 3 ] . +   + if we consider as @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the equation @xmath46 and @xmath50 we have the cassini identities of fibonacci octonions .",
    "hence , we conclude that horadam octonions are a generalization of all the fibonacci - like octonions .",
    "+ summation formula for the first @xmath53 horadam octonions can be given as follows .",
    "+    the sum formula for horadam octonions is follows , + @xmath54 + where @xmath55 is as follows , + @xmath56    using the binet formula we can calculate the summation formula as follows @xmath57 from geometric series we get the following @xmath58 after direct calculations we will get the explicit result as @xmath59    summation formula for horadam octonions is a generalization of summation formula for fibonacci octonions which can be calculated according to its initial values as follows .",
    "@xmath60    using the initial values and roots of characteristic equation we state the norm of @xmath61 horadam octonion as follows .",
    "+    the norm of nth horadam octonion is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is @xmath64    we defined @xmath61 horadam octonion as @xmath65 so , norm of @xmath61 horadam octonion is @xmath66 making necessary calculations and using the equations @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we will get the explicit form of desired result as @xmath69 @xmath70    one can observe that the norm of horadam octonions is generalization of pell octonions and pell - lucas octonions . to get desired norms on [ 3 ]",
    "one can take values @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we define horadam octonions which is studied for the first time .",
    "moreover , we give their binet formula and some identities related with them .",
    "we demonstrate that our results are generalization of the other studies in this area .",
    "it should be noted that the further studies can be to investigated to get new identities about horadam octonions .",
