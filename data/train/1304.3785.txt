    "the newly discovery of ternary iron - selenide superconductors a@xmath0fe@xmath6se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs , and tl ) @xcite opens an interesting route to explore the origin of high temperature superconductivity in fe - based superconductors .",
    "these materials have @xmath3 up to 30k , which is relatively high in comparison to the average @xmath3 in the family of fe - based superconductors . however , unlike many other fe - based materials , in which the sc order gets suppressed in the presence of the af order due to their strong competition , early resistivity measurements @xcite surprisingly found that af order and sc order coexisted while @xmath3 was still kept relatively high .",
    "further systematic investigations reveal that @xmath3 s and the af transition temperatures ( @xmath7 ) of these materials exhibit similar trends : both @xmath7 and @xmath3 are higher in the sc samples than those in the non - sc sample .",
    "this clearly implies that the coexisted antiferromagnetic ordering and superconductivity are not simply competing against each other @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is found that the af phase coincides with the @xmath8 fe - vacancy order with extraordinarily large magnetic moment of 3.3@xmath9/fe @xcite .",
    "these results prompt a critical examination and explanation on how the af order with large moment can coexist with the sc order while @xmath3 remains so high .    to explore the origin of relatively high @xmath3 in ternary iron - selenides , the nature of the phase with coexistence of sc and af orders is further examined .",
    "a number of experiments @xcite show that instead of being coexistent homogeneously , the sc and af orders are phase separated at mesoscopic scales . in particular , the volume fraction of the sc phase is estimated to be less than 20% by using local probes texier2012,shermadini2012 . furthermore , it is shown that metallic behavior is exhibited in the sc phase @xcite , while semiconducting behavior is found in the magnetic phase @xcite .",
    "in addition , a heterostructure arrangement of sc and af layers stacking alternatively is observed in tem experiments @xcite , in consistent with the picture suggested by charnukha",
    "_ et al_. @xcite .",
    "a more direct visualization is obtained by recent stm results @xcite , in which two distinct regions along c - axis are clearly identified in k@xmath10fe@xmath11se@xmath12 compound , sc kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 ( 122 system ) and insulating k@xmath10fe@xmath13se @xmath2 ( 245 system ) with the @xmath8 order .",
    "furthermore , it is found that pure kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 could exist in a metallic state without superconductivity but with weak charge density wave @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "much work has been devoted to understand homogeneous af and sc phases of either 122 or 245 system @xcite .",
    "little is known about the mechanism of superconductivity in the combined system .",
    "recently , jiang _ et al_. @xcite investigated a bilayer heterostructure with both sc and af phases .",
    "based on the pair - hopping approximation between the sc and af layers , it is shown that a drop of magnetic moment occurs in the af layer when the temperature goes below the sc transition , in agreement with the observation of neutron scattering experiments @xcite . since the effect on sc phase due to the af order is found to be quite substantial @xcite , it is interesting to examine what is the effect of af order on superconductivity , especially in the presence of such strong af order in the iron - vacancy - ordering phase .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate superconductivity in a bilayer system with iron vacancy - free layer on top of an iron vacancy - ordered af layer ( 245 ) . the iron vacancy - free layer is nominally taken to be the 122 system with fitted band structures .",
    "the electronic structures are examined under different strength of interlayer hopping , interlayer spin coupling , and af order .",
    "it is shown that both the interlayer hopping and interlayer spin coupling generally suppress superconductivity .",
    "in particular , the interlayer hoppinng would result in deformed fermi surfaces structures that tend to frustrate the coupling of sc orders on fermi surfaces .",
    "however , unexpectedly we find that for fixed hopping amplitude , larger af orders actually result in larger sc orders , which explains the observed relatively high @xmath3 and trends of @xmath3 versus the af transition temperature @xmath7 @xcite in these phases .",
    "our results imply that in the 2d limit , the pure sc phase in phase - separated ternary iron selenides may have a much higher @xmath3 , being around @xmath14 .",

    "comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) shows that the suppression of the sc order is due to the deformed fs structures induced by the interlayer hopping .",
    "the deformed fs structures generally frustrate the coupling of sc orders on fs s and thus suppress the sc order .",
    "however , in the presence of strong af order , the 245 layer is insulating with a gap .",
    "since the coherence length @xmath148 of an af phase is @xmath149 with @xmath150 being the characteristic fermi velocity , a large af gap implies a short penetration depth of the af order into the sc layer .",
    "hence the induced deformation of fs structure is weak , which leads to weak suppression of superconductivity .",
    "note that since the interlayer hopping between af layer and sc layer suppresses @xmath3 , these results imply that the pure sc phase has a higher @xmath3 .",
    "if one takes @xmath98 and @xmath151 as a reasonable estimation of phase - separated ternary iron selenides , the real sc transition is around @xmath14 , which is comparable to highest observed @xmath3 in the family of iron selenides @xcite .",
    "the suppression of @xmath152 due to the interlayer hopping @xmath84 is also studied by berg _",

    "the susceptibility suppression also happens in our case as one can see that in eq .",
    "( [ susceptibility])@xmath155 will change @xmath114 and @xmath156 and thus values of @xmath157 .",
    "however , due to multi - orbital nature of our model , the behavior of @xmath3  at small @xmath84 do not follow simple quadratic behavior . only for weak suppression of @xmath3 at large",

    "the interlayer spin coupling @xmath159 is 0.01 with the corresponding @xmath160 s for _ _ u__=1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 cases being 0.0016 , 0.0032 , and 0.0001 respectively.,width=326 ]    finally we examine effects of interlayer spin interaction @xmath19 on superconductivity . for this purpose ,",
    "we first note that @xmath19 only characterizes single particle scattering in the 122 layer and 245 layer respectively .",
    "hence the effective hamiltonian for scatterings of cooper pairs in the 122 layer must be second order in @xmath19 .",
    "to the second order in the perturbation theory , scattering of two particle for particle - particle channel in the 122 layer is given by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the unperturbed ground state energy , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 is the energy excitation for the intermediate state . during the scattering of two particles in the 122 layer ,",
    "scatterings in the 245 layer are captured by the magnetic susceptibility with the major weight being in particle - hole excitations since the particle - hole excitation energy of an af insulator is the sum of the energies for two quasi - particles above the af gap , the change of energy for the intermediate state during scattering of cooper pairs is at least @xmath165 . by neglecting dispersion of energy spectrum ,",
    "we find @xmath166 @xmath167 .",

    "the mechanism behind the behavior of suppression of @xmath170 is clearly due to the dependence of effective pairing strength @xmath160 being inversely proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "in addition to direct interlayer spin coupling , in real materials , @xmath159 may arise from super - exchange interaction between the 122 and 245 layers .",
    "in that situation , @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath171 . since @xmath172",
    ", we have @xmath173 . as a result ,",
    "not only the wave - function hybridization due to @xmath174 but also the interlayer spin interaction resulted from @xmath175 suppress pairing and result in non - monotonic suppression of @xmath3 with @xmath170 being less suppressed for large @xmath81 .",
    "hence while both interlayer hopping and interlayer spin couplings suppress superconductivity , a large af order in the 245 layer can result in stronger superconductivity in the 122 layer .",
    "in summary , we have found that the existence of large magnetic moment in the af phase is the key reason of why the phase - separated ternary iron selenides can maintain a relative high @xmath3 despite of the strong competition between sc and af orders .",
    "based on a minimal bilayer model with both the 122 and 245 phases , we show that proximity effects of the af order on the sc order generally result in the deformation of fs due to the interlayer hopping and cooper pair scatterings due to the interlayer spin interaction .",
    "it is shown that the deformed fs s generally frustrate coupling of sc orders and result in the suppression of superconductivity .",
    "in addition , the interlayer spin coupling generates repulsive cooper pair scattering and it also tends to suppress superconductivity .",
    "however , when the af phase has a large af order , it is insulating with a large gap and the penetration of the af order into the sc layer is suppressed . as a result , the superconductivity is protected against interlayer hopping and interlayer spin coupling when @xmath81 is much larger than the interlayer hopping .    while our results are consistent with experimental observations made so far , there are a number of experimental observations of 3d - like fs s in the phase - separated region @xcite .",
    "to account for these experimental results , it would require a relatively large interlayer coupling .",
