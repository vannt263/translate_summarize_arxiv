    "evidence for the existence of the exotic baryon @xmath0  @xcite has been stimulating theoretical and experimental studies in hadron spectroscopy . the study of multiquark states in qcd will eventually lead to the understanding of the rich structure of hadronic matter .",
    "recently , however , the existence of the @xmath0 has become controversial  @xcite .",
    "there are more than 10 experiments that indicate evidence of the @xmath0 , whereas a similar number of experiments claim null results .",
    "in such a situation , confirmation of existence ( or nonexistence ) of the @xmath0 is urgent and crucially important . for this",
    ", it is strongly desired to clarify the reaction mechanism for the production of @xmath0 . among various possibilities ,",
    "a particularly interesting property that is expected to be characteristic to exotic baryons is their strong coupling to two - meson states in transitions to an ordinary baryon .",
    "this is the subject we study in the present paper .",
    "studying two - meson coupling is important for several reasons .",
    "first , a heptaquark model has been proposed in the early stage of development to explain a light mass and a narrow decay width  @xcite .",
    "although a quantitative study  in particular with a model of hadrons where @xmath0 is regarded as a bound state of @xmath6 system  does not work with the present knowledge of hadron interactions , a two - meson contribution to the self - energy of @xmath0 has been shown to be consistent with the expected pattern of the masses of the antidecuplet members  @xcite .",
    "second , the importance of two - meson coupling has been implied from an empirical observation of the extended ozi rule  @xcite .",
    "the dominance of connected quark lines favors creation of a @xmath7 pair in the transition of @xmath8 , which is naturally associated with the coupling to two mesons , whereas a coupling to a single meson is suppressed .",
    "finally , two - meson coupling plays an important role in reaction studies . without two - meson coupling ,",
    "all the amplitudes for @xmath0 production are proportional to the @xmath9 coupling , which is fixed by the very small decay width of the @xmath0 .",
    "however , two - meson coupling is determined from other source as we will see in the following , independently of the @xmath9 coupling .",
    "therefore , even with the extremely narrow width of @xmath0 , a sizable cross section can be obtained with two - meson coupling .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analysis of the two - meson coupling is performed in the study of the self - energy of the @xmath0 , assuming that @xmath2 with @xmath10 in the same antidecuplet ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 can not decay into @xmath12 channel , the coupling constants are determined from the @xmath13 decay into the @xmath1 channel and flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "two types of lagrangians are found to be important for the self - energy of the baryon antidecuplet .",
    "it is also shown that the two - meson contribution is indeed dominant over a single - meson contribution",
    ". however , the assumption of pure @xmath11 may not be the case in reality .",
    "this point is clarified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we study the phenomenology of flavor partners for the @xmath0 .",
    "we assign the masses of experimentally known particles in an octet - antidecuplet mixing scheme , finding good fits for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the decay width of the @xmath0 is also evaluated in the same scheme , and the @xmath14 case naturally explains the narrow width , in accordance with the quark model estimation  @xcite . in both @xmath15 cases ,",
    "we obtain relatively large mixing angles , which implies the importance of the representation mixing .    hence ,",
    "combining these two findings , we calculate the two - meson couplings including the representation mixing .",
    "first we determine the coupling constants of @xmath16 from the experimental widths and separate the @xmath11 component from the @xmath17 component .",
    "then , by using su(3 ) symmetry , the coupling constants of @xmath18 can be determined for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , including representation mixing of @xmath17 and @xmath11 .",
    "we focus on the decay channels in which the two pions are correlated in scalar - isoscalar and vector - isovector channels , which are the main decay modes of the resonances and play a dominant role in the @xmath0 self - energy  @xcite .    as an application of the effective lagrangians , we perform the analysis of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 reactions .",
    "these reactions were studied using effective lagrangian approaches  @xcite .",
    "experiments for @xmath19 have been performed at kek  @xcite , and a high - resolution experiment for the @xmath20 reaction is ongoing .",
    "we can compare the results with these experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the framework of representation mixing and relevant experimental information of nucleon decay . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lag ] , the effective interaction lagrangians for nucleons and for the antidecuplet are introduced for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases .",
    "the coupling constants are determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] by considering the decay widths of @xmath13 resonances and the self - energy of the @xmath0 . with the effective lagrangians ,",
    "the reaction processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : reaction ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary .",
    "let us briefly review the previous study of representation mixing  @xcite and summarize the experimental decays of nucleon resonances .",
    "we have performed a phenomenological analysis on the exotic particles using flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "it is found that the masses of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are well fitted in an antidecuplet ( @xmath11 ) representation which mixes with an octet ( @xmath17 ) , with known baryon resonances of @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath23 case gives too large a decay width for the @xmath0 , and not enough resonances are well established for @xmath24 to complete the analysis . under the representation mixing , the physical nucleon states are defined as @xmath25 two states @xmath26 and @xmath27 represents @xmath28 and @xmath10 for the @xmath29 case and @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the @xmath3 case .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath32 can be determined by experimental spectra of known resonances as @xmath33 both angles are close to the ideal mixing @xmath34 , in which the nucleon states are classified by the number of strange quarks ( antiquarks ) . in other words , states are well mixed and the effect of mixing of states is important .    using these mixing angles and decay widths of nucleon resonances ( @xmath35 ) , we can calculate the decay width of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) through the su(3 ) relation between the coupling constants @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the coupling constants of @xmath36 and nucleon resonances . with the known coupling constants @xmath40 and @xmath41",

    "for these terms , we need the yukawa couplings such as @xmath74 and @xmath75 couplings .",
    "there are two schemes to introduce the yukawa couplings , namely , pseudoscalar ( ps ) and pseudovector ( pv ) schemes .",
    "for the construction of the born amplitude , it is reasonable to rely on chiral symmetry , where the two schemes should provide the same results .    in this case",
    "the meson - baryon scattering amplitude should be a quantity of @xmath76 or higher , where @xmath77 is a momentum of mesons . in the pv scheme , since each @xmath78 coupling is of @xmath76 , the born amplitude behaves as @xmath79 , consistent with this observation .",
    "in contrast , a naive construction of the born term in the ps scheme leads to an amplitude of @xmath80 .",
    "it is well - known that a scalar exchange term cancel the term of @xmath80 .",

    "in the nonrelativistic expansion this term yields a @xmath93-wave coupling so that the square of momenta appears in the vertex .",
    "it reduces the contribution further than the @xmath29 case , and therefore , the effect of born terms for @xmath14 is also small .",
    "in this paper , we studied the two - meson couplings of @xmath0 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "these values were further constrained in order to provide appropriate size of the self - energy of the @xmath0 . finally , we applied the effective lagrangian to the meson induced reactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we found that there is an interference effect between the two amplitudes of the scalar and vector types , which can help to explain the very small cross section for the @xmath19 reaction observed at kek  @xcite . in this case , reflecting the symmetry under exchange of two amplitudes , the large cross section for @xmath20 reaction was obtained as a consequence of the interference .",

    "we observe that the large cross section of the order of millibarns for @xmath20 is obtained for the @xmath29 case , whereas the upper limit of the cross section is not very large for @xmath3 case .",
