    "the method we develop is an analytical approach based on the jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation .",
    "it is first tested at zero temperature by making sure it reproduces all the numerically derived exact existing results , then it is applied at finite temperature .",

    "however , no zero - temperature phase diagram was produced in their work .",
    "none of these analytical methods was able to create a complete phase diagram including the weak , intermediate , and strong coupling regimes which compares well with numerical data because of their various limitations .",

    "the system can be found in one of the three different ordered states displayed on the left of this figure . when @xmath29 , the system adopts the nel state with ferromagnetic spin arrangements along the diagonals . when @xmath30 the system adopts the ferromagnetic rung state . in this case , the af arrangement shifts to the diagonals , and spins on the rungs are forced to adopt a ferromagnetic arrangement . when @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the system adopts a ferromagnetic chain state , where the spins on the chains are ordered ferromagnetically , and antiferromagnetically on the rungs .",
    "the phase diagram in this classical limit will also be given later on for comparison .",
    "in the heisenberg limit with full quantum fluctuations , we assume that in a one - to - one correspondence each of the magnetic orders in fig . [",
    "fig : jd1 ] evolves into a state which is characterized by only short - range order of the same kind as in the ordered state .",
    "so , we replace the rigid up and down orientations of the spins by sublattice labels @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jd1 ] . according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "the boundaries in the phase diagram of the ising limit move as a consequence of quantum fluctuations , but the number of phases stays the same , namely three . for this reason",
    ", we continue to label the phases using the same terms as in the ising limit except that we now add the word type to indicate that the phases are not magnetically ordered but are rather characterized by short - range order only .",
    "so , the phases are now called nel - type ( n - type ) state , ferromagnetic - type rung ( r - type ) state , and ferromagnetic - type chain ( f - type ) state . for the n - type state in the absence of frustration , the ground - state of the two - leg ladder is a gapped disordered spin liquid dominated by short - range af correlations for any nonzero @xmath35.@xcite the gap increases linearly with rung coupling , except near zero coupling where a slight downward curvature is present .",
    "the ferromagnetic - type rung state is also referred to as the haldane - phase or rung triplet phase because in this case the system presents some resemblance to the @xmath36 chain .",
    "precisely , in the case @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath39 , with low - lying excitations identical to those of the @xmath36 haldane chain due to the fact that the interaction is now between the resultant of the two spins on the rungs.@xcite the n and f - type states are also known as the dimerized or singlet states because of the formation of singlets along the rungs in the quantum case .",
    "the two phases belong to the same universality class so they are only topologically distinct due to the symmetry of the system.@xcite for the n - type state , in the limit @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the ground state is made of independent rung singlets .",
    "we use the spin arrangements on the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : jd1 ] as a starting point .",
    "we assume that in the heisenberg limit short - range af correlations are important enough to justify its use .",
    "note that these spin arrangements are not static in the quantum limit , but fluctuate while the relative average orientations of adjacent spins remain the same .",
    "we will confirm that the frustrated two - leg ladder is characterized by quantum criticality ( criticality at zero temperature induced solely by quantum fluctuations ) , and show that it is also characterized by criticality at nonzero temperature .",

    "our gap behaves linearly in all the mean - field calculations whereas in the dmrg it is nearly horizontal for small and large values of @xmath108 .",
    "the most important feature that both bmft and dmrg results share is that the gap shows a minimum at the critical value of @xmath108 . in the dmrg results@xcite , the transition was interpreted to be second order because the gap vanishes ( within uncertainty ) at the transition . in bmft",

    "for @xmath116 the minimum gap value from dmrg@xcite is @xmath117 , and in bmft it is @xmath118 .",

    "@xcite as frustration increases the local minimum at 0 decreases rapidly but the absolute minimum at @xmath71 decreases only slowly .",
    "so the energy gap decreases slowly while the minimum is at @xmath71 , but starts to decrease rapidly once the absolute minimum shifts to @xmath124 .    within the bmft ,",
    "the shape of the spectrum for @xmath125 and @xmath126 is different from the exact one .",
    "but as discussed in ref.@xcite , the important feature shared by both results is the presence of an energy gap .",
    "also , bmft rightfully describes the physics of the two - leg ladder in this limit , namely that the ground state consists of the formation of renormalized spin singlets on the rungs .",
    "the difference in the curves for the energy gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : engap4 ] ) is due to the complex behavior of the spectra shape as the couplings are varied . near the boundary line between r and n - type states , for @xmath122 and @xmath121 the bmft spectra yield a low - lying excitation spectrum that overall behaves like the dimer - expansion data of ref .",

    "[ fig : parameterstemp ] because thermal fluctuations allow the rungs to adopt sometimes the af arrangement .",
    "note that eventually , the af correlations diminish in the very high temperature limit , a fact that is indicated by @xmath58 decreasing as @xmath128 after reaching a maximum . in the ising limit ,",
    "the phase boundary between the r - type and n - type phases is @xmath129 , and the boundary between the r - type and and f - type phases is @xmath130 .",

    "it is found that as temperature increases the phase boundaries move toward @xmath131 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "as temperature rises @xmath58 approaches but never becomes larger than @xmath59 and @xmath57 for @xmath132 , fig .",

    "the parameters decrease following a curie - weiss @xmath138 law but never vanish , excluding in this way the occurrence of any finite - temperature phase transition from a state with finite spin bond order to a high-@xmath110 state with zero spin bond order . note that eqs .",
    "( [ hight ] ) fit very well the numerically calculated parameters as seen in fig .  [ fig : parameterstemp ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the parameters have the same form and show the same dependence on the ratio of the coupling constant , in the direction in which the parameter is calculated , and temperature .",
    "note that the smallest parameter corresponds to the direction in which the spins are ferromagnetically arranged , e.g. @xmath58 is the smallest parameter in the r - type state . at high temperature ,",
    "it is easy to see from  ( [ eq : ht ] ) that the parameter corresponding to the smallest coupling value will be smallest .",
    "so , in the high - temperature limit the largest coupling value determines the state of the system . this is why the boundaries in the phase diagram shift to @xmath139 and @xmath115",
    "for sets of coupling values ( @xmath140 , @xmath108 ) within the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetemp ] , the thermal fluctuations can cause a first - order phase transition from the r - type state to the f - type state or n - type state .",
    "there are no thermally - induced transitions between the f - type and n - type states because the boundary between the n and f - type states is not temperature dependent due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian with respect to exchanging @xmath13 and @xmath141 terms .",

    "the specific heat is calculated using @xmath146 .",

    "we found that in the limit @xmath107 and @xmath154 the jump in entropy goes to zero . for small coupling values this jump could be smaller than experimental precision",
    "( if a real material existed ) so that it would become difficult to assert that the transition is a first - order one .",
    "for example , for @xmath116 and @xmath155 the jump in entropy is about @xmath156 only . note that because all three states are gapped , both entropy and specific heat show an activated behaviour in the viscinity of zero temperature .",
    "all the phases of the system are disordered ; i.e. , none of them is characterized by long - range magnetic order of any kind .",
    "the proposed thermally - induced criticality can be seen as a remnance of the zero-@xmath110 ( quantum ) criticality because of the temperature dependence of the phase boundaries . as mentionned",
    "earlier in the introduction , the mean - field parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 do not represent any kind of long - range order .",
    "the zero - temperature phase transitions we analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : zerotemp ] all occur between disordered phases that differ only by the way the spins arrange themselves on very short distances ( refer to fig .  [",
    "fig : jd1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that the finite-@xmath110 transitions we find here for the present practically one - dimensional system are not an artifact of the mean - field character of bmft .",
    "these phase transitions are due to frustration ; i.e. , they disappear once frustration is brought to zero .",
    "they are also a consequence of the fact that the zero-@xmath110 quantum phase transition boundary depends on temperature .",
    "because zero temperature can not be reached in practice , a quantum phase transition can not in fact be observed directly . for the present system , the signature for such",
    "a transition would be the observation of the finite-@xmath110 transitions ( if an experimental system existed ) .",
    "while the quantum criticality we find in this system has been already found elsewhere using exact numerical methods , the criticality at finite temperature we report on here remains to be confirmed by other theoretical methods .",
    "experimentally , if ever a frustrated two - leg ladder where the strength of frustration is as important as the coupling along the rungs and chains existed , then thermodynamical measurements would either confirm or refute our claims .",
    "perhaps the application of a high pressure on a two - leg ladder material could increase the diagonal interaction and allow the search for this thermally - induced criticality . in the absence of diagonal interaction ( frustration ) , the af heisenberg two - leg ladder shows neither quantum nor classical criticality .",
    "interestingly , it is the frustration that is responsible for both criticalities .",
    "a strong argument in favor of the existence of the finite-@xmath110 criticality is the existence of the zero-@xmath110 one itself because in both cases each phase boundary separates two of the same three disordered phases .",
    "denying the finite-@xmath110 criticality would amount to denying the zero-@xmath110 one according to the present theory .",
    "in this work , we studied quantum as well as classical criticality in the two leg - ladder with exchange interactions along the chains , rungs , and diagonals using the jordan - wigner transformation and the bond - mean - field theory .",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram of this system is calculated .",
    "we found it to exhibit three quantum phases , characterized all by an energy gap and absence of magnetic order .",
    "these states are labeled nel - type ( n - type ) , rung - type ( r - type or haldane - type ) and ferromagnetic - type chain ( f - type ) states .",
    "this result agrees well with existing numerical data .",
    "the transitions from one phase to any of the two others are all first - order . because they occur at zero temperature , they enter under the category of quantum phase transitions .",
    "when temperature increases for some sets of coupling values , the system undergoes a phase transition from the r - type state to the n or f - type state at a finite temperature .",
    "the finite temperature phase diagram is calculated as well . in it ,",
    "the size of the r - type state becomes smaller while the f - type state and the n - type state increase in size with increasing temperature .",
    "the good agreement between our results and existing exact results for the zero-@xmath110 phase diagram suggests that the present mean - field treatment is acceptable .",
    "the various phase transitions found in this work occur between magnetically disordered states .",
    "it is solely the frustration , the spin bond parameters and the nature of short - range magnetic correlations that determine the nature of all three phases that characterize the frustrated antiferromagnetic heisenberg two - leg ladder . in the present mean - field - type approach ,",
