    "the primary objectives of near future neutrino experiments are to determine the ordering of the neutrino masses and to measure the value of @xmath16 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the origin of neutrino mass and lepton flavor mixing is still unknown although there has been lots of theoretical studies .",
    "motivated by the observation that the simple tri - bimaximal mixing possibly originates from a @xmath17 flavor group , non - abelian discrete flavor symmetry has been extensively exploited to explain the observed lepton mixing angles .",

    "many approaches have been pursued to explain such a largish @xmath8 . within the paradigm of the discrete flavor symmetry",
    ", model - independent scan of the lepton sector reveals that only large flavor symmetry groups ( e.g. @xmath21 with the group i d [ 648 , 259 ] ) can produce mixing patterns compatible with experimental data and the dirac @xmath0 phase is generally trivial if the lepton mixing matrix is fully fixed by the symmetry alone  @xcite .    in order to accommodate a non - zero @xmath8 and a nontrivial dirac @xmath0 phase simultaneously , it is interesting to combine flavor symmetry with @xmath0 symmetry",
    "this approach can generate a rich structure of mixing patterns which are in good agreement with the experimental data , and it allows us to predict all the mixing angles and @xmath0 phases in terms of a small number of input parameters  @xcite . from the bottom - up point of view , the generic neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices have both residual @xmath0 symmetry and residual flavor symmetry , and the residual flavor symmetry can be generated from the residual @xmath0 transformations  @xcite .",

    "the neutrinoless double @xmath270 decay is a lepton number violating process .",
    "it is an important probe of the majorana nature of neutrinos , and it can provide us with precious information on the neutrino mass scale and ordering . searching for @xmath271 decay has a long history .",
    "there are many new sensitive @xmath271 experiments which are in various stages of planning and construction .",
    "the @xmath271 decay rate is proportional to the effective majorana mass @xmath272 which is expressed in terms of neutrino masses and lepton mixing parameters as  @xcite , @xmath273 where @xmath274 are light neutrino masses . for each admissible case ,",
    "the allowed regions of the effective majorana mass @xmath272 as a function of the lightest neutrino mass are shown in figure  [ fig : mee_uab ] , figure  [ fig : mee_uac ] and figure  [ fig : mee_uac_2 ] . both parameters @xmath275 and @xmath276 freely vary between @xmath277 and @xmath278 , and the three lepton mixing angles are required to lie in their current @xmath223 ranges  @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath272 does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "hence if two cases have the same residual symmetry but differ in the permutation matrices with @xmath233 and @xmath234 respectively , the same predictions for @xmath272 would be obtained . for the case of ih neutrino mass spectrum ,",
    "the effective majorana mass is almost independent of the value of @xmath279 .",
    "the reason is because the term in @xmath272 proportional to @xmath280 is suppressed by both @xmath236 and the small value of @xmath280 itself .",
    "moreover , we see that @xmath272 is predicted to be around the upper boundary 0.048  ev , lower boundary 0.015  ev or close to 0.028  ev for ih .",
    "although these predictions are beyond the reach of the facilities in running , the next generation elaborate @xmath271 decay experiments are capable of covering the full ih region , such that the present predictions could be tested in near future . for the case of nh mass spectrum ,",
    "cancellation between different terms in @xmath272 could occur for certain values of the lightest neutrino mass , consequently the effective mass can be smaller than @xmath281  ev .",
    "however , the range of @xmath282 in which @xmath272 can be quite small is significantly reduced with respect to the generic case .",
    "we can even find a non - trivial lower bound on @xmath272 in some cases , see e.g. figure  [ fig : mee_uab ] for the remnant symmetry @xmath283 with @xmath284 .",
    ".[tab : res_symm_lepton ] the residual flavor symmetries @xmath285 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , the corresponding residual @xmath0 transformations @xmath227 consistent with @xmath231 and the takagi factorization matrix @xmath228 .",
    "let s denote the generator of @xmath231 as @xmath230 , then @xmath232 is also a residual @xmath0 symmetry , and it is given in the parenthesis .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we do not distinguish between the abstract elements of the @xmath6 group and their representation matrices in @xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "following the methods in section  [ subsec : criterion_z2xcp ] and section  [ sec : quark_z2xcp ] , we can find out the criterion to determine whether two distinct residual symmetries of the structure @xmath1 in both the up and down type quark sectors lead to the same ckm matrix for the general case with @xmath286 , if possible shifts of the free parameters @xmath287 and @xmath288 are considered . the expression for the combination @xmath289 is written as eq .  .",
    "one can always set @xmath290 and @xmath291 to be real and positive by redefining the quark fields .",
    "we shall report the results in the following .",
    "* @xmath292 ,   @xmath293 + in this case , the conditions under which essentially the same quark mixing is obtained , are given by @xmath294 with @xmath295 * @xmath296 ,  @xmath297 + the equivalent conditions are found to be @xmath298 where @xmath299 with @xmath300 * @xmath301 ,   @xmath206 + the resulting ckm matrices would be related through redefinition of the parameters @xmath287 and @xmath302 if the following constraints are fulfilled , @xmath303 where @xmath304 with @xmath305 * @xmath296 ,   @xmath206 + the postulated residual symmetries would give rise to the same quark mixing pattern if the following conditions are satisfied , @xmath306 note that the above results are valid up to the transformations in eq .",
