    "[ th : comtetparam ] the domain of convergence of the transformed series is defined by equations @xmath378 which is equivalent to @xmath379 where @xmath79 is the root of equation @xmath380 .",
    "the proof of the theorem is similar to that of theorem [ th : convcomtetreal ] and based on an application of theorem  [ th : convcomtetsigmatau ] to the transformed series . in particular , substituting the expressions in we obtain in the real case , i.e. under assumption @xmath381 , the inequality . applying lemma [ lemma ] to the latter",
    "we get , where @xmath382 , which justifies the above assumption and the theorem follows .",
    "the formula can be obtained by substituting equations in .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath383 defined by , @xmath384 is monotone decreasing with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the larger @xmath18 , the wider domain of convergence of the transformed series ( cf .",
    "remark [ rem : x(alpha ) ] ) .    in the formula , when @xmath385 but @xmath386 , we can also write @xmath387 .    [ remark 7.2 ] the convergence condition can be extended to the case of complex @xmath116 similar to the extension of the condition for the untransformed series by theorem  [ th : convcomtetcomplex ] .    to find out the domain of convergence of the transformed series one should substitute in and solve the obtained equation for @xmath116 as a function of @xmath18 . as a result",
    ", we obtain formulae to compute @xmath384 similar to those stated in theorem [ th : alphadomains ] .",
    "we also can find a very good approximation for @xmath384 for @xmath388 using equation @xmath231 , stated in remark [ rem : x = x1 ] , and theorem [ th : similarity ] . specifically , substituting in this equation we obtain @xmath389    the accurate and approximate values of @xmath384 are depicted in figure [ fig : x(p ) ] by solid line and circles respectively together with curve ( dashed line ) .",
    "it follows from figure [ fig : x(p ) ] as well as from and that with increase of parameter @xmath18 the domain of convergence of the transformed series monotonely extends . to illustrate and qualitatively verify this result we design an appropriate numerical procedure .",
    "the method is simply to compute the partial sum of a series to a high number of terms , using extended floating - point precision as necessary , and then to plot the ratio of the partial sum to the exact value ( the exact value is obtained using a built - in maple function lambertw(k , x ) , where a method different from series summation is used ) .",

    "this point is very close to 1 , which sharp demonstrates the result in theorem [ th : convreal ] .",
    "we can summarize the above findings by noting that series ( [ eq : improvedstir ] ) has a wider domain of convergence , and a better behaviour with @xmath18 , while the domain of convergence for series ( [ eq : comtet ] ) becomes worse in that order .",
    "the fact that the domain of convergence of the transformed series is extending while the parameter @xmath18 is increasing can also be found in the complex case based on the results of theorems [ th : convcomplex ] and [ th : comtetparam ] . to make certain of this",
    "it is sufficient for the series , to substitute expressions ( with @xmath391 ) into equation and for the series , to consult remark [ remark 7.2 ] .",
    "the results are presented for @xmath392 in figure [ fig : complexdomain2ap ] and figure [ fig : complexdomain3ap ] for the series and respectively where the curves for @xmath371 are the same as in figure [ fig : complex ] and the points of intersection of the curves with the positive real axis correspond to points on the curves depicted in figure [ fig : x(p ) ] .      by rate of convergence",
    ", we are referring to the accuracy obtained by partial sums of a series .",
    "given two series , each summed to @xmath393 terms , the series giving on average a closer approximation to the converged value is said to converge more quickly .",
    "the qualification ` on average ' is needed because it will be seen in the plots below that the error regarded as a function of @xmath116 can show fine structure which confuses the search for a general trend .",
    "further , the comparison of rate of convergence between different series can vary with @xmath116 and @xmath18 .",
    "for some ranges of @xmath116 , one series will be best , while for other ranges of @xmath116 a different series will be best .",
    "although one series may converge on a wider domain than another , there is no guarantee that the same series will converge more quickly on the part of the domain they have in common .",
    "the practical application of these series is to obtain rapid estimates for @xmath0 using a small number of terms , and for this the quickest convergence is best , but this will be dependent on the domain of @xmath116 .",
    "the previous section showed that positive values of the parameter @xmath18 extend the domain of convergence of the series , but its effect on rate of convergence is different .",
    "figures [ fig : comtetaccuracy ] and [ fig : improveaccuracy ] show the dependence on @xmath116 of the accuracy of computations of the series ( [ eq : comtet ] ) and ( [ eq : improvedstir ] ) respectively with @xmath394 for @xmath395 and @xmath390 .",
    "one can see that the behaviour of the accuracy is non - monotone with respect to both @xmath116 and @xmath18 although some particular conclusions can be made .",
    "for example , one can observe that for the series ( [ eq : comtet ] ) at least for @xmath396 within the common domain of convergence the accuracy for @xmath397 and @xmath390 is higher than for @xmath398 .",
    "for the series ( [ eq : improvedstir ] ) an increase of positive values of @xmath18 reduces a rate of convergence within the common domain of convergence i.e. for @xmath399 .",
    "however , at the same time for @xmath400 computations with @xmath398 are more accurate than those with positive @xmath18 and for @xmath401 the highest accuracy occurs when @xmath402 .    the next two figures [ fig : comtet fixed z ] and [ fig : improved fixed z ] display the dependence of convergence properties of the series ( [ eq : comtet ] ) and ( [ eq : improvedstir ] ) respectively on parameter @xmath18 for different numbers of terms @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",
    "again , the curves in these figures confirm that the accuracy strongly depends on parameter @xmath18 and is non - monotone and show that on the whole an increase of the number of terms improves the accuracy .",
    "it is also interesting that there exists a value of @xmath18 for which the accuracy at the given point is maximum ; this value depends very slightly on @xmath393 and approximately is @xmath405 in figure [ fig : comtet fixed z ] and @xmath406 in figure [ fig : improved fixed z ] .",
    "the explained behaviour of the accuracy depending on parameter @xmath18 shows that introducing parameter @xmath18 in the series can result in significant changes in accuracy .",
    "the pointed out non - monotone effects of parameter @xmath18 on a rate of convergence can be due to the aforementioned non - monotone behaviour of @xmath27 .",
    "the above discussion has considered only real values for the parameter @xmath18 .",

    "although the maximum error occurs at @xmath419 , the transformed series is exactly correct at @xmath420 .",
