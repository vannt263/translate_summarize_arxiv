    "vortices appear in several branches of physics , such as fluid dynamics ,  @xcite superfluidity ,  @xcite bose - einstein ( b - e ) condensates ,  @xcite and superconductivity .",
    "@xcite the vortex is usually described by a field ( for instance , the velocity field ) which diverges as @xmath5 as one approaches its core .  @xcite they can be treated as quasiparticles ,",
    "since they can be created or destroyed , they interact with each other and with the interfaces . unlike in fluid dynamics , in superfluids",
    "( including here superconductors and b - e condensates ) vortices are quantized objects . in superconductors , for example , they carry a magnetic flux which is a multiple of the flux quantum , @xmath6 , and are characterized by a core of area @xmath7  where the superconductivity is highly depreciated  surrounded by superconducting currents ( screened at distances of order @xmath8 ) . here , @xmath9 is the coherence length .",
    "they have been intensively studied , since abrikosov  @xcite predicted their existence from the solution of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations in a type - ii superconductor for @xmath10 ( see also refs .   and  ) . in an infinite , and defect free superconductor ,",
    "vortices arrange themselves in an hexagonal ( abrikosov ) lattice .",
    "a detailed phenomenological description of the superconducting state can be derived from the gl theory ,  @xcite by means of two parameters : the complex order parameter , @xmath11 , which is related to the superconducting electron density , and the vector potential , @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "each vortex can be viewed as a particle , since inter - vortex separations , @xmath14 , are such that @xmath15  assuring that vortex cores do not overlap  and the major role between vortex - vortex interactions is played by the superconducting shielding currents . in such cases",
    "the london limit turns out to be a good approximation of the gl theory , becoming better for higher values of @xmath16 ( see for example refs .  ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the superconducting electron density is considered constant throughout the entire superconductor and the vortex cores are represented by singularities in the phase of the order parameter .",
    "this allows to treat vortices as particles .    in a thin film of thickness @xmath17 ,",
    "the effective magnetic field shielding length turns out to be the effective penetration depth , @xmath18 , instead of @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite at distances @xmath19 the electromagnetic interaction is still logarithmic , as in the three dimensional case , but with screening length @xmath20 [ however the perpendicular magnetic field and the shielding currents decay as @xmath21 and @xmath22 far away from the vortex core for @xmath19 , instead as @xmath23 in the bulk case . ]",
    "similarly as in the bulk case , in a thin film vortices also form an hexagonal abrikosov lattice .",
    "@xcite    in mesoscopic superconductors both the geometry and size of the specimen influence the vortex configurations , due to the interaction between vortices and the surface .",
    "therefore , for small enough samples ( with sizes comparable to @xmath9 ) , the conventional hexagonal lattice predicted by abrikosov no longer exists , and vortex configurations adjust to the sample geometry , yielding some kind of vortex molecule states .",
    "@xcite for example , vortices arrange themselves in ringlike structures in disks with radii ( @xmath24 ) a few times @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite such patterns show similarities to what is observed in electrons in artificial atoms , where particles obey specific rules for shell filling and exhibit magic numbers .",
    "nevertheless when overlapping of vortices starts to take place , discrepancies between vortices and a picture based on particles arise , such as the formation of giant vortex states .",
    "also , vortex - antivortex configurations may become possible for non circular geometries .",
    "@xcite    within the london limit the vortex interaction potential in a thin disk of arbitrary radius was first calculated by fetter  @xcite .",
    "also in the london limit , vortex configurations up to @xmath25 were studied by buzdin and brison  @xcite for @xmath26 ( where demagnetization effects can be neglected ) . in the latter limit it is possible to substitute the interaction between the vortices and the disk border by the interaction between vortices and their images ( see also ref .  ) . within the london limit one",
    "is able to find analytical expressions for the energy and forces of an arbitrary arrangement of vortices inside the disk , since vortices can be treated as particles .",
    "vortices considered as particles were also studied by monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations . in ref .",
    "vortex configurations with up to 2000 vortices were studied and an hexagonal lattice was found for thin disks , although they did not consider the vortex interaction with the disk edge .",
    "vortex molecules in long cylinders with radius much larger than @xmath8 were studied by venegas and sardella .",
    "@xcite other geometries were investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example .    in this paper",
    "we will study multivortex states where many vortices nucleate , yielding a triangular lattice in the center of the disk and a ringlike structure close to the edges . within the gl framework",
    "several other works have been reported regarding vortex states in thin disks ,  @xcite but they were limited to much smaller disk radius .",
    "in such small systems the formation of multivortex states with high vorticity is not allowed and , consequently , it was not possible to study the transition from a ringlike structure to an abrikosov lattice , which is the subject of the present paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in fact for such large @xmath119values @xmath274 no longer increases and the peak in @xmath289 is slightly broadened due to the appearance of grain boundaries in the abrikosov lattice as will be shown in the next section .",
    "as a result of the competition between the geometry induced ring - like structure near the disk border and the hexagonal structure in the center , topological defects in the lattice appear in between these two regions ( a feature also observed in confined classical systems  @xcite ) . in order to study the distribution of these deffects in the disk",
    ", we applied the voronoi construction . in an infinite system both the gl theory and the london approach predict a coordination number equal to six and the voronoi construction would yield hexagonal unit cells for each vortex . in the disk",

    "the expected number of nearest neighbors should be four .",

    "vortices with coordination number @xmath311 ( positive topological charge ) appear accompanied by negative topological charges , leading to the formation of dislocations .",
    "the defects in the vortex configurations are more suitable to sit in the disk edge or in the region delimiting the abrikosov lattice and the ring - like structure .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath4 increases , dislocations proliferate and form grain boundaries in the region where the hexagonal lattice appears .",
    "this is also the reason why the @xmath251 and @xmath252 states have smaller @xmath274 values and less sharper peaks in the @xmath289 distribution than the lower @xmath4 states , for instance @xmath237 .",
    "such feature is also observed in simulations performed by reefman and brom  @xcite considering @xmath312 vortices ( although they considered vortices in the london limit without interaction with the disk edge ) and in classical systems of charged particles interacting with each other via the coulomb potential and confined to a parabolic potential .",
    "@xcite    koulakov and shklovskii  @xcite described the presence of dislocations in configurations of classical charged particles confined by a parabolic potential as due to two main reasons : the inhomogeneity in the density of particles and the presence of disclinations .",
    "the latter ( which is always present in an hexagonal arrangement confined to a disk ) causes a large deformation in the particle configurations .",
    "dislocations thus appear in order to reduce such deformations , eventually decreasing the energy of the system .",
    "such effect , also called screening , was previously described by nelson and halperin  @xcite when studying the melting driven by dislocations in two dimensional systems , and is linked to the lack of translational long - range order in two - dimensional solid systems ( although orientational order is still present ) .",
    "@xcite these dislocations are arranged close to or at the disk edge .",
    "the former reason induces dislocations in the interior of the disk . in ref .",
    ", it was found that there exists a threshold number of particles ( which in their case is approximately @xmath1 ) below which dislocations are due mainly from screening and , above which , such defects appear due to the inhomogeneity of the particle density .",
    "at least qualitative similarities exists between such system of charged particles and our vortex configurations .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to speculate that the same mechanisms which drive the appearance of dislocations is also present here . just like in the system of charged particles ,",

    "one can notice that the total number of defects is not a monotonic function of the london energy of the configuration .",

    "for example , a configuration free of dislocations ( in which only six disclinations occur ) almost always has a higher energy than , e.g. , one with a total number of @xmath314 topological charges .",

    "within this sheath @xmath324 , opposed to a maximum of @xmath325 between two adjacent vortices . nevertheless , according to the criterion adopted to characterize the existence of a giant vortex state ( @xmath326 in the region between vortices ) ,  @xcite a giant vortex state appears at @xmath327 . in this state @xmath328 , except at @xmath329 where @xmath330 ( cf .",
    "[ surf1 ] at right ) . at @xmath321",
    "the maximum value of @xmath331 is @xmath332 in the region between two adjacent vortex cores , while @xmath333 at the disk edge .",
    "such a configuration is not yet a giant vortex state , although the multivortex state in this case is extremely ` dilute ' .",
    "possibly @xmath320 is close to the field in which a giant vortex state decays into a multivortex state .",
    "@xcite moreover , at this magnetic field the depreciation of @xmath176 close to the vortex cores is different whether a vortex sits in the outermost ring or in the interior of the disk .",
    "this feature is depicted in fig .",
    "[ surf2 ] , where a contour plot of the logarithm of the superconducting electron density is shown in the center of the disk ( at left ) and close to the edge ( at right ) .",
    "we investigated the magnetic field dependence of vortex states in thin disks with large radius .",
    "the nonlinear gl equations , as well the london approximation were used to obtain stable vortex configurations .",
    "although both methods lead , for small fields , to similar vortex configurations , the energies are different .",
    "this is the reason for the failure of the london limit to yield the correct ground state configuration . for low values of the vorticity we improved the london approximation by including the spatial variation of @xmath176 close to the vortex cores , which resulted in energies which were very close to those of the gl approach .",
    "multivortex states were obtained for fields up to @xmath334 , above which a giant vortex state appears .",
    "we investigated how the configuration of this multivortex state changes as function of the magnetic field . at low magnetic fields ( @xmath335 )",
    "we find vortex configurations having ringlike distribution , as expected from symmetry considerations .",
    "however as the number of vortices increases , the vortex - vortex repulsion starts playing a larger role and we observed the appearance of an hexagonal lattice .",
    "the ringlike structure is replaced by an abrikosov lattice in the center of the disk as soon as the field is close to @xmath336 , when @xmath337 , but is preserved near the edges . for fields larger than @xmath338",
    "this abrikosov lattice becomes even more pronounced compared to the ringlike structure .",
    "the topological defects in the vortex configurations and their distribution were also studied .",
    "we observed two types of defects : ( wedge ) disclinations and dislocations .",
    "the net topological charge is always @xmath309 , as required for an hexagonal structure confined to a circular geometry .",
    "similar to classical particles confined in radially symmetric potentials , we find that these topological defects appear mostly close to the edge for @xmath339 , in order to adjust the ringlike structure to the abrikosov lattice .",
    "we attribute the presence of dislocations in that region due to the screening of disclinations . as @xmath4 increases",
    "further dislocations start to be spread in the center of the disk and form grain boundaries .",
    "surface superconductivity was observed at fields around and above @xmath340 .",
    "this surface superconductivity becomes more pronounced as the vorticity increases , which resulted in a larger overlap between the vortices .",
    "we also noticed that the transition from a multivortex to a giant vortex state takes place at magnetic fields slightly above @xmath341 . just below the formation of the giant vortex state",
    ", the superconducting electron density presents markedly distinct spatial dependence close to the disk edge  where the vortex structure starts to coalesce  compared to what is observed in the center of the disk .",
