    "staggered quarks @xcite employ an incomplete reduction of the lattice doubling symmetry , and therefore have an extra degree of freedom called `` taste . '' in four dimensions , a single staggered field on the lattice produces four tastes in the continuum limit .",
    "it is possible to interpret taste as physical flavor ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) by explicitly breaking the continuum taste symmetry with general mass terms @xcite .",
    "however , that approach leads to a variety of problems including complex determinants , violations of chiral symmetry even in the limit of vanishing light quark masses , and the necessity of fine tuning . the current standard approach  and the one assumed in this paper",
    " is to introduce a separate staggered field for each physical flavor , and then attempt to eliminate the unwanted taste degree of freedom by taking a root of the staggered fermion determinant .",
    "this procedure was proposed by marinari , parisi and rebbi @xcite in a two - dimensional context ; a fourth root is required in four dimensions .",
    "such `` rooted '' staggered quarks have been used by the milc collaboration for recent dynamical simulations @xcite , which give good agreement with experiment for many simple hadronic quantities @xcite .",
    "there is wide - spread agreement that , whatever their practical problems in reproducing the desired four - flavor mass spectrum , `` unrooted '' staggered fermion quarks are a consistent way to simulate four degenerate tastes of quarks in the continuum limit .",
    "but the correctness of the fourth root trick to reduce four tastes to one has not been proven , and there are concerns expressed in the literature about its use in lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "the difficulties arise from the fact that taste symmetry is broken at order @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lattice spacing .",
    "this prevents one from implementing the rooting simply by projecting the local four - taste staggered dirac operator onto a local operator in a single - taste subspace . without a local dirac operator ,",
    "usual physical properties of a lattice theory such as unitarity or universality are called into question . in the past few years , many authors have addressed the issue of the validity of the fourth - root procedure @xcite . while a proof is still lacking , the result of these investigations is to make it rather plausible that staggered quarks with the fourth - root trick do in fact have the correct continuum limit . at finite lattice spacing , however , it seems clear that the fourth root procedure introduces a variety of unphysical sicknesses .",
    "this follows not only from the renormalization group approach introduced by shamir @xcite , but also from the staggered chiral theory , as discussed below .",
    "the issue is then to prove that these unphysical effects disappear or decouple in the continuum limit .    here , i start with a simpler , but related , problem : what is the chiral theory that correctly describes rooted staggered quarks ?",
    "lee and sharpe @xcite found the chiral theory that corresponds to a single unrooted staggered field . in the current terminology , this is a one - flavor case , with four tastes .",
    "it was generalized to more than one flavor ( more than one staggered field ) and called `` staggered chiral perturbation theory '' ( s0.4expt ) by aubin and bernard @xcite .",
    "certain , rather noncontroversial , assumptions go into these derivations . in particular , one needs to know the symanzik theory @xcite that describes unrooted staggered quarks as one approaches the continuum limit . in deriving the symanzik theory",
    ", one assumes that the taste , lorentz , and translation symmetries become exact in the continuum , and that the lattice symmetries fit inside the continuum group in a straightforward way .",
    "in addition to theoretical understanding of why this should be the case @xcite , there is good numerical evidence for the restoration of these symmetries @xcite . to find the chiral theory for _ rooted _ staggered quarks , an additional assumption is needed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed that one could represent the effects of the fourth root by locating the sea quark loops in s0.4expt , and then multiplying each one by a factor of @xmath11 . here , i take this prescription as defining what i mean by s0.4expt   for rooted staggered quarks .",
    "the question then becomes : is s0.4expt  the correct chiral theory ?    in this paper ,",
    "i show that the validity of s0.4expt  follows from certain nontrivial assumptions on the phase structure and mass dependence of the theory .",
    "these assumptions will be introduced as needed ; the most important of them are also collected in the concluding section .",
    "while i will try to argue from simulations and experience for the plausibility of these assumptions , significantly more work is required to prove and/or numerically test them . on the other hand ,",
    "in most cases it will be clear that the assumptions are not only sufficient for the validity of s0.4expt  but also necessary .",
    "tests of the assumptions therefore provide new means to test s0.4expt  itself .",
    "note first of all that s0.4expt  for rooted quarks does show unphysical effects at nonzero lattice spacing . in the published literature , this is seen most clearly in prelovsek s calculation of the flavor nonsinglet scalar correlator @xcite . on the lattice",
    ", she finds intermediate - state contributions with mass below that of the lightest physical intermediate state ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "i call this sickness a `` unitarity violation '' at finite lattice spacing , since it is due to contributions from `` extra '' light mesons of various tastes , which only cancel completely in the continuum limit .",
    "the flavor - singlet scalar correlator provides another example of such unitarity violation .",
    "it has recently been worked out for the three- and one - flavor cases , both unrooted and rooted @xcite . because the one - flavor case is a key test of the ideas discussed in the current paper , i present some relevant details in .",
    "the scalar correlator at nonzero lattice spacing has intermediate - state contributions from light pseudo - goldstone pions , even though a one - flavor theory should have only a massive pseudoscalar , the @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , these unphysical states decouple from the correlator in the continuum limit .",
    "thus s0.4expt  captures some sicknesses expected of the rooted theory at nonzero lattice spacing .",
    "but it is not obvious that s0.4exptcaptures all such sicknesses .",
    "perhaps there are other violations of unitarity , or indeed other more subtle features of the rooted theory , that should be present in the corresponding chiral effective theory but are missed by s0.4expt .",
    "i argue below that no such effects are missed .",
    "the starting point is a special case in which there is virtually no doubt about the correct chiral theory : a rooted theory with four degenerate quark flavors . in this case , the fourth - roots of the four determinants are identical , so their product just gives the determinant of a single , unrooted staggered field .",
    "( note that the staggered determinant is positive , and the algorithmic treatment of the rooting trick in the simulations gives the positive fourth root @xcite . ) with the noncontroversial assumptions mentioned above , the corresponding chiral theory is just the s0.4expt  of lee and sharpe @xcite .",
    "one can then expand around the degenerate case to treat the case of nondegenerate masses .",
    "for technical reasons , this requires the use of a partially quenched chiral theory with valence masses degenerate with those of the sea quarks .",
    "golterman , sharpe and singleton ( gss ) @xcite show that the phase structure of a quenched chiral theory can be subtle , and analogous questions can be raised about the partially quenched theory .",
    "the use of partial quenching in this paper seems to be safe from any gss subtleties .",
    "however , since the theory has not yet been investigated in detail using the gss methods , i highlight a few places where complications could conceivably enter . further investigation along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite is planned .",
    "the completion of the argument for four nondegenerate flavors requires nontrivial assumptions about the analytic structure of the mass dependence .",
    "in particular , i need to assume that there is no essential singularity at zero degeneracy in the difference between s0.4expt  and the putative correct chiral theory .",
    "phase transitions in the chiral theory at nonzero quark mass differences would also be dangerous , although the existing simulations @xcite can be put forward as evidence against such phase transitions , at least in the region of parameter space investigated to date .    to move to the phenomenologically more interesting case of three light flavors",
    ", the mass of one quark can be taken large . in s0.4expt",
    ", it is quite clear that the heavy quark will decouple , leaving three - flavor s0.4expt .",
    "however , in the lattice qcd of rooted staggered quarks , the nature of the decoupling , while in my opinion plausible , requires an additional assumption . with this assumption",
    ", it follows that s0.4expt  is the correct chiral description of the rooted three flavor theory .",
    "the process can then be repeated , leading to statements about the two- and the one - flavor theories .    if s0.4expt  is accepted as the correct chiral description , it provides strong evidence that rooted staggered quarks have the desired continuum limit , in other words that they are in the correct universality class .",
    "the point is that s0.4expt  automatically becomes continuum chiral perturbation theory ( 0.4expt ) in the continuum limit , modulo the usual assumptions on the restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit of unrooted staggered quarks .",
    "therefore , this line of reasoning says that the low energy ( pseudoscalar meson ) sector of lattice qcd with rooted staggered quarks is , in the continuum limit , indistinguishable from that of ordinary qcd .",
    "this would significantly reduce the `` phase space '' for any possible sicknesses of rooted staggered quarks in the continuum limit .",
    "another consequence of the arguments in this paper is more technical : if s0.4expt  is valid , the lattice theory with rooted staggered sea quarks and ordinary staggered valence quarks ( the theory in the milc simulations @xcite ) behaves like a `` partially quenched '' theory .",
    "effectively , this means that there are symmetries that connect valence and sea quarks . as usual for a partially quenched theory ,",
    "such symmetries may be broken in a controlled way by mass differences between valence and sea quarks .",
    "however , the symmetries are not broken by lattice corrections .",
    "the theory therefore does not behave like a `` mixed '' theory , in which valence and sea quarks have different lattice actions . in the mixed case ,",
    "there are no symmetries at finite lattice spacing that connect valence and sea quarks .",
    "the chiral descriptions of mixed theories @xcite thus have terms  vanishing in the continuum limit  that violate such symmetries .",
    "these terms can , for example , lead to mass splittings between mesons composed of two valence quarks and those composed of one valence and one sea quark .",
    "i show here that the chiral theory for staggered valence and rooted staggered sea quarks does _ not _ have such terms ; corresponding valence - valence , valence - sea , and sea - sea mesons are degenerate .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in , i discuss the replica trick in s0.4expt ; this is a systematic way to find sea quark loops in the chiral theory and multiply each by a factor @xmath11 . then introduces the notation needed to describe the various theories considered here , at both the qcd and the chiral levels , and makes some introductory comments about these theories .",
    "the details of my assumptions and arguments for s0.4expt  in the four - flavor case are presented in ; while the extension to three or fewer flavors is treated in . shows in some detail how the one - flavor case works .",
    "i resolve there the apparent paradox of light pseudo - goldstone mesons appearing the one - flavor chiral theory .",
    "consequences of my arguments for the rooted theory at the qcd level are described in .",
    "finally , i review the assumptions and conclusions and make some additional remarks and speculations in .",
    "in s0.4expt  for rooted staggered quarks , one needs to identify the presence of sea quark loops in various meson diagrams , and multiply each such loop by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "the sea quark loops were located in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the quark flow approach @xcite .",
    "while quark flow gives a rather intuitive physical picture , it suffers from the disadvantage in the current case that it is formulated as a series of rules for tracing flavor indices , not as an algebraic statement .",
    "the replica trick provides an alternative approach that is systematic and algebraic .",
    "it was applied to partially quenched theories by damgaard and splittorff @xcite and was first used for s0.4expt  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the replica procedure for rooted s0.4expt  is very simple : one starts by replicating the sea - quark flavors , replacing each dynamical staggered field by @xmath14 identical copies , where @xmath14 is a ( positive ) integer .",
    "one then calculates straightforwardly order by order in the corresponding ( unrooted ) s0.4expt , keeping the @xmath14 dependence explicit .",
    "finally , one sets @xmath15 .",
    "note that , at any finite order in s0.4expt , the @xmath14 dependence is polynomial : it just comes from the sum over the sea quark indices in meson loops .",
    "therefore , the process of taking @xmath16 is straightforward and unambiguous order by order .",
    "as always in chiral perturbation theory , we treat the low energy constants ( lecs ) as free parameters for each @xmath14 .",
    "we should not use any relations that hold only for special values of @xmath14  analogous to those discussed by sharpe and van de water  to reduce the number of chiral operators . if it turns out that we are left with some redundant operators when @xmath17 , we can always redefine the lecs to absorb the redundancy at the end . within chiral perturbation theory",
    ", we do not worry about ( nor do we have any control over ) the dependence of low energy constants themselves on @xmath14 .",
    "such dependence , coming from an underlying qcd - like theory , would in fact be nonperturbative in the strong coupling @xmath18 and probably not polynomial in @xmath14 .    at the qcd level , it is difficult to give the replica trick any meaning beyond weak - coupling perturbation theory , in which the @xmath14 dependence is again polynomial . within weak - coupling perturbation theory ,",
    "the replica trick is in fact somewhat useful , because it provides a convenient way of keeping track of sea - quark loops .",
    "this can aid in clarifying the argument in ref .   of the validity of the fourth - root procedure in perturbation theory , and will also be helpful in .",
    "nonperturbatively , however , even if we were to assume that the @xmath17 limit should be taken by analytic continuation , the replica trick would be ambiguous since there is no unique continuation from the integers .",
    "a related comment is that the use of the replica trick for a chiral theory is valid , _ a priori _ , only for order by order calculations in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we have no guarantee of its correctness in general nonperturbative chiral calculations , such as the determination of the correct vacuum state .",
    "however , in the degenerate four - flavor theory , we know the chiral theory ( and hence the appropriate phase ) independent of the replica trick . as i move away from the degenerate limit , i will in any case need to assume that dependence on quark mass is smooth and no phase change occurs ( see ) .",
    "thus , there is no further restriction coming from the perturbative nature of the replica trick .",
    "we need some notation to refer to the various versions of qcd and their corresponding chiral theories .",
    "define a version of lattice qcd by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of flavors ( the number of staggered fields ) , @xmath21 is the number of tastes per field , and @xmath14 is the number of replicas .",
    "the corresponding chiral theories are denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath14 is trivially equal to 1 ( because the replica trick is not relevant ) , it is omitted .",
    "when @xmath22 or @xmath19 are used in equations , i am referring specifically to the generating functionals for these theories , with sources to be discussed below .",
    "i focus primarily on three versions of qcd , and four versions of chiral theories :    * @xmath23 and @xmath24 : these are the chiral and qcd theories of a single staggered field ( one flavor ) with four tastes . by ( noncontroversial ) assumption , the chiral theory @xmath23 is just the s0.4expt  of lee and sharpe @xcite .",
    "no rooting is done at the qcd level , and no replica trick is necessary at the chiral level . *",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 : these are the theories for @xmath20 staggered fields ( @xmath20 flavors ) , each replicated @xmath14 times . when @xmath14 is indicated explicitly , as in this case , it is taken to be an integer only ; no rooting is done .",
    "the chiral theories @xmath25 are  again by noncontroversial assumption  just those of aubin and bernard @xcite for integer ( @xmath27 ) number of flavors . they are obtained from the @xmath20 flavor chiral theories by replicating the sea - quark degrees of freedom in the chiral fields . * @xmath28 and @xmath29 : these are the chiral and qcd theories of @xmath20 staggered fields ( @xmath20 flavors ) with the @xmath30 taken at the qcd level to reduce 4 tastes to 1 for each flavor .",
    "since i do not want to assume here that the rooting procedure is correct , i write the @xmath4 for tastes in quotation marks . then @xmath28 is by definition the chiral theory generated by @xmath29 .",
    "the main point of this paper is to construct @xmath28 unambiguously .",
    "* @xmath31 : this is the chiral theory @xmath25 , now implementing the replica trick by taking @xmath16 , with the goal of describing rooted staggered quarks . in the literature ( _ e.g. _ ,",
    "@xcite ) , it is _ assumed _ that this procedure produces the right chiral theory ; in other words , it is assumed that @xmath28 = @xmath31 .",
    "here , i define s0.4expt  as @xmath31 , and then ask the question of whether s0.4expt  is indeed the correct chiral theory . note that i avoid reference to corresponding qcd theories `` @xmath32 '' because , as discussed in , i do not know how to give unambiguous meaning beyond perturbation theory to the replica trick for those qcd - level theories .    for my arguments , the chiral theories @xmath25 are key objects . on the other hand , the corresponding qcd theories @xmath26 , in particular @xmath33 , are introduced for convenience , because they allow one to keep track more easily of the factors of @xmath14 that relate valence- to sea - quark matrix elements ( see ) .",
    "these qcd - level theories can be eliminated at the expense of a somewhat less intuitive argument at the chiral level , related to quark flow .",
    "an outline of such an alternative argument is given in ; it does however seem to require a weak additional assumption . because the @xmath33 theories are just used formally , it is probably unnecessary that the standard , broken realization of chiral symmetry assumed in @xmath34 actually occurs in @xmath33 .",
    "the unpleasant fact that asymptotic freedom ( and presumably spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ) is lost for @xmath35 in @xmath33 seems to be irrelevant . an easy way to see",
    "this is to realize that the precise correspondence between @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be maintained by an artifice , as follows : note first that the order of the polynomial dependence on @xmath14 is bounded at a given order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "this means there is maximum value of @xmath14 , @xmath36 , that need be considered in order to determine the polynomial completely .",
    "one can then simply imagine increasing the number of colors sufficiently to ensure that the qcd theory has the standard , spontaneously broken , realization of chiral symmetry for any @xmath37 .",
    "recall that the mesonic chiral theory generated by a given @xmath33 is independent of the number of colors as long as the phase is unchanged .",
    "the numerical values of the lecs do depend on the number of colors , but we are uninterested in those values here .    in the next section",
    ", i argue that the replica trick produces the correct chiral theory in the four - flavor case . in other words ,",
    "i claim that @xmath38 this should be taken as a statement about the generating functionals of the two chiral theories .",
    "i use `` @xmath39 , '' rather than `` @xmath40 , '' to compare two chiral theories , because what i mean is that they are the same functions of the lecs : true equality would only result if we adjusted the lecs to be the same .",
    "one also needs to be careful about what sources ( equivalently , external fields ) one is allowing in the green s functions on both sides of equations such as .",
    "for example , there are more sea - quark fields available in the @xmath41 theory , from which @xmath42 is obtained , than there are in the @xmath43 theory .",
    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , such generating functionals should be taken to describe partially quenched theories , with sources coupled to valence fields only .",
    "ghost ( bosonic ) fields , degenerate with the valence fields and required to cancel the valence determinant , are also implicit . when i need to make the sources explicit",
    ", i will include any valence sources @xmath44 among the arguments , for example @xmath45 .",
    "identical staggered valence fields with identical valence sources are always assumed on both sides of equations relating generating functionals .",
    "the key ingredient is the observation that , when there are four degenerate flavors ( four staggered fields with equal masses ) , the rooting procedure clearly reduces the four flavor theory to a one flavor theory . in other words , instead of acting on tastes and ( presumably ) reducing the four tastes per flavor to one taste per flavor , we can think of the rooting in this case as acting on flavor and reducing four fields to one , without affecting the tastes .",
    "let the quark mass matrix be @xmath46 .",
    "the condition of degeneracy is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a number and @xmath49 is the identity matrix in flavor space .",
    "it then follows that : @xmath50 the last equivalence in is manifest order by order in s0.4expt : since the result for any physical quantity is polynomial in the number of degenerate flavors , taking @xmath51 degenerate flavors and then putting @xmath15 gives the same chiral expansion as a one - flavor theory .",
    "one can make a stronger statement than by adding sources and computing specific green s functions in the degenerate case . in order to keep the arguments simple ,",
    "i generally use only taste - singlet scalar sources , which are all that are necessary to allow us to move beyond the degenerate mass limit . for writing explicit terms in the chiral theory ,",
    "however , it will be convenient below to include pseudoscalar sources temporarily , since it is linear combinations of scalar and pseudoscalar source that transform simply under chiral transformations .",
    "one can also easily generalize to sources of arbitrary taste if desired .",
    "i start by adding introducing the scalar sources into the sea - quark sector of the qcd - level theory @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the sea quark field of flavor @xmath54 at space - time point @xmath55 . for convenience ,",
    "i work in the taste representation @xcite , with taste ( and spin ) indices on @xmath56 implicit , but there is no reason why one can not work directly with the one - component staggered fields instead .",
    "the source @xmath57 is taken to be a hermitian matrix in flavor space .",
    "the mass and source terms are then : @xmath58 where sums over flavor indices @xmath59 are implied .",
    "one needs to state precisely here what is meant by a rooted staggered theory with sources . in this paper , i always mean : ( 1 ) introduce the sources into the corresponding unrooted theory ; ( 2 ) integrate the sea quark fields to get a determinant that is a function of the sources ; ( 3 ) replace the determinant by its fourth root . derivatives with respect to the sources ,",
    "if desired , are taken only after step ( 3 ) .",
    "now introduce the same sources into the replica qcd theories @xmath33 , with the specification that a given source couples equally to all replicas .",
    "we have : @xmath60 sums over the replica index @xmath61 , as well as the flavor indices @xmath54 and @xmath62 , are implied .",
    "when the sources are nonzero ( which includes the case of nondegenerate quark masses as a special case ) , we do not yet know that @xmath42 is the right chiral theory .",
    "one could imagine that there are extra terms in @xmath43 that vanish in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "so i define the difference to be an unknown functional @xmath64 $ ] : @xmath65 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath66\\!=\\!0 $ ] .",
    "as far as we know at this point , @xmath64 $ ] could be quite sick .",
    "for example , it could generate euclidean correlation functions with unphysical decay rates ( unphysical intermediate states ) , even in the continuum limit .",
    "there are further restrictions on @xmath64 $ ] coming from the fact that the two chiral theories must be equivalent when there is exact flavor symmetry .",
    "we must have @xmath64\\!=\\!0 $ ] whenever @xmath57 is proportional to the identity in flavor space or can be brought there by an @xmath67 chiral flavor rotation .",
    "therefore it takes some care even to write down a possible term in @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "i temporarily add a hermitian pseudoscalar source @xmath68 to the theories .",
    "for example , corresponding to is @xmath69 the spurion combinations @xmath70 and @xmath71 transform simply under chiral rotations @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 if @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a constant matrix and @xmath77 is a c - number function , then @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be made everywhere proportional to the identity by the chiral rotation @xmath80 , @xmath81 and there is exact flavor symmetry , unbroken by masses or sources .",
    "we can now look for possible terms in @xmath82 , at first expressed as functionals of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "an example that satisfies the above requirements is @xmath85   - \\fourth{\\textrm{tr}}\\left [ h(x)\\ , h^\\dagger(x)\\right ]      { \\textrm{tr}}\\left [ h(y)\\ , h^\\dagger(y)\\right ] \\bigg ) \\eqn{v1big}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a flavor trace , and @xmath87 a distance scale that might not go to zero in the continuum .",
    "for example , one could have @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is some constant . in the worst case",
    ", @xmath90 might not even correspond to the mass of any physical particle in qcd .    removing the pseudoscalar source @xmath68 and keeping only the lowest nonvanishing term in @xmath7 ,",
    "one gets the following example of a possible contribution to @xmath64 $ ] : @xmath91   - \\fourth{\\textrm{tr}}\\left [ s(x)\\right]\\ ,      { \\textrm{tr}}\\left [ s(y)\\right ] \\bigg ) \\eqn{v1}\\ ] ] the goal is of course to prove that @xmath92 $ ] actually vanishes .",
    "if we take derivatives of the generating functionals with respect to @xmath7 and evaluate them at @xmath63 , we will have green s functions for degenerate quark masses .",
    "at the level of the chiral theories , i claim that ( modulo some technical assumptions ) actually imply the stronger statement : @xmath93 for any given combination of derivatives with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "a difficulty in proving is that , as soon as the sources are taken to be nonzero in order to compute the derivatives , we no longer know that @xmath43 and @xmath42 are the same .",
    "further , i must avoid the use of @xmath94 , which is not well defined .",
    "finally , i can not use @xmath24 easily as an intermediate step , because sea quark sources with nontrivial flavor ( @xmath95 ) can not be inserted into a one - flavor theory .",
    "the need for nonzero sea - quark sources in can be circumvented by using valence sectors , in other words , by considering the partially quenched version of .",
    "i thus introduce into all theories of interest an arbitrary number , @xmath96 , of staggered valence fields @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the valence flavor index .",
    "these have degenerate mass @xmath48 and are coupled to valence sources @xmath99 , giving mass and source terms as follows : @xmath100 with sums over @xmath101 and @xmath102 implied .",
    "the valence - quark source @xmath103 is exactly analogous to the sea - quark source @xmath95 ; they only differ in the type of quarks to which they couple .",
    "i also introduce @xmath96 corresponding ghost ( bosonic ) quarks , again with degenerate mass @xmath48 .",
    "these ghosts do not couple to the @xmath103 source , so that derivatives with respect to @xmath103 produce green s functions made purely of ( fermionic ) valence quarks .",
    "when @xmath104 , the valence and ghost determinants cancel .",
    "the partially quenched version of remains valid , since the valence / ghost sectors are identical on both sides , and the sea - quark determinants are equal as long as the sea - quark source @xmath7 vanishes ( giving degenerate masses ) : @xmath105 where sea and valence sources are indicated explicitly .",
    "the equality of generating functionals must also be true for the corresponding chiral theories : @xmath106 this follows by definition of what it means to be the corresponding chiral theory .",
    "i am assuming that such partially quenched chiral theories exist .",
    "but note that the starting lqcd theories both have local actions , so this appears to be a rather safe assumption .",
    "i am not claiming , however , that i know explicitly how to calculate ghost or valence green s functions in either of these chiral theories .",
    "my expectation is that the `` naive '' meson feynman rules , which follow from the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite , are probably correct .",
    "however , to prove that would require an analysis along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the proper saddle point for the mesons constructed from valence or ghost quarks , around which the chiral perturbation theory can be developed .",
    "such an analysis is in progress .    in discussing",
    ", i claimed that the equivalence of the @xmath107 and @xmath42 theories is `` manifest '' order by order in s0.4expt . in the presence of valence / ghost fields and sources , the corresponding statement is almost certainly still true .",
    "even if the saddle point for ghost mesons ( or valence ) mesons is nontrivial , it is very difficult to see how it could be affected , order by order , by the difference between having one sea - quark flavor or having @xmath51 degenerate sea flavors and then putting @xmath15 .",
    "combined with , this gives @xmath108    in the limit @xmath109 , all quarks , both valence and sea , are degenerate .",
    "this means one can relate green s functions constructed from sea - quark fields to those constructed from valence fields , or equivalently , relate derivatives with respect to @xmath7 to those with respect to @xmath44 .",

    "it could go wrong in two ways .",
    "first of all , there may be a connected `` line '' of singularities , an actual `` domain boundary '' that prevents one from extending @xmath64\\!=\\!0 $ ] arbitrarily far from @xmath63 .",
    "of course , 0.4expt  or s0.4expt  must eventually break down for large enough quark masses , so it is meaningless to imagine extending to mass differences that put one or more masses outside the range of chiral perturbation theory .",

    "if such a boundary occurred , it would probably imply a phase change : that the true ground state for @xmath131 changes discontinuously from the ground state assumed by @xmath42 .",

    "but the effects of a phase change that occurred outside the ( rather wide ) range of masses or lattice spacings studied by milc would probably not have been noticed .",
    "in addition , since the milc simulations involve three flavors , the logical possibility exists that a phase change occurs with four flavors but disappears when the fourth quark is decoupled . on the positive side ,",
    "note that @xmath42 automatically becomes standard continuum 0.4expt  in the continuum limit ( see ) . therefore",
    ", if @xmath64\\not=0 $ ] outside some mass region , we must at least have @xmath64\\to0 $ ] in the continuum limit to avoid the bizarre scenario in which @xmath52 is a valid four - flavor qcd theory in some range of quark mass differences but not outside this range",
    ".    a second way that the analyticity assumption could go wrong would be the presence of essential singularities in @xmath64 $ ] for all values of @xmath7 such that the flavor symmetry is exact .",
    "for example , one could imagine that @xmath64\\propto \\exp(-1/v^2_1)$ ] .",
    "although i can not rule them out at this point , such singularities seem implausible to me , since we are expanding around a massive theory in euclidean space and there are thus no obvious infrared problems .",

    ", i speculate on a possible proof of the absence of an essential singularity in @xmath64 $ ] at @xmath63 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath64 $ ] is analytic is equivalent to the assumption that the expansion of @xmath64 $ ] around @xmath63 is convergent .",

    "an alternative line of reasoning for qed is due to dyson @xcite .",
    "he argued that the expansion in @xmath101 around @xmath132 must be asymptotic because @xmath133 leads to an unstable vacuum and therefore can not be smoothly connected to the @xmath134 region .",

    "each such loop corresponds exactly to a quark loop at the qcd level and produces one factor of @xmath14 .",
    "the same analysis then needs to be repeated for diagrams with valence quark indices .",
    "note that this argument assumes that , at the chiral level , mesons made from ( fermionic ) valence or sea quarks have identical feynman rules , except for the counting factors coming from replication .",

    "the most interesting cases phenomenologically are three light flavors ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , or , at extremely low energies , two light flavors ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) . to extend the above argument to @xmath136",
    ", we can start by taking one the mass of one of the four quarks large and using decoupling ideas @xcite . call this quark the charm quark , with mass @xmath137 .",
    "the difficult point here is that the relation can only be used where chiral perturbation theory is applicable , so we can not just take @xmath138 on both sides of and then appeal to decoupling .    in the real world , we know that the effective coupling of 0.4expt  for the strange quark is roughly @xmath139 @xcite , with @xmath140 .",
    "so it is likely that 0.4expt   breaks down completely for quark masses that are not very much larger than the physical strange quark mass , @xmath141 .",
    "for concreteness , imagine the breakdown occurs at @xmath142 , in other words for meson masses greater than @xmath143 , which is the mass of a `` kaon '' made with a strange quark of mass @xmath144 .",
    "i want to decouple the charm quark from s0.4expt  before this breakdown occurs , say at @xmath145 . since there is not a lot of room between this value of @xmath137 and @xmath141 , it is useful to consider first the case where @xmath146 is significantly smaller than @xmath141 .",
    "i try to argue that this @xmath2 case is correctly described by @xmath147 .    with @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath146 all small ,",
    "i increase @xmath137 to @xmath150 .",
    "modulo the assumptions discussed in , the relation @xmath151 should continue to hold for @xmath137 in this range .",
    "i then integrate out ( decouple ) the charm quark degree of freedom from the chiral theory @xmath42 .",
    "the procedure is completely analogous to the way the strange quark is decoupled from the continuum @xmath152 chiral theory to obtain the @xmath153 theory @xcite .",
    "since this process is perturbative , there is little doubt that what remains after the charm quark is decoupled will be the @xmath154 chiral theory , @xmath147 . in the chiral limit ,",
    "rather problematic ; while the `` fine '' lattices ( largest splittings @xmath155 ) , should be acceptable . ] nevertheless , a check of this assumption in s0.4expt  would be reassuring , and is planned @xcite .",
    "thus i expect @xmath52 with @xmath145 to be described at low energy by the chiral theory @xmath147 .",

    "when @xmath137 gets to be of order of the cutoff , @xmath157 , one expects that it will decouple in the usual way from the qcd - level theory , leaving @xmath158 .",
    "the only effect of the charm quark should be renormalizations of the @xmath158 couplings",
    ". the decoupling would be virtually certain if @xmath52 were a normal theory described by a local lattice action .",

    "i believe the assumption is plausible because the chiral theory shows that @xmath137 is already decoupled from the low energy physics by @xmath163 .",
    "i am simply assuming that it stays decoupled as its mass is increased further .",

    "a line of reasoning parallel to that in can now be applied : once is known to be valid for some range of quark masses , then the difference between the two theories must vanish everywhere if it is analytic .",
    "the analyticity could be violated by a phase boundary at some values of the quark mass differences .",
    "however , i can again point to the milc simulations @xcite as evidence against a phase boundary within the region of parameter space that has been studied .    the arguments ( and assumptions ) of this section",
    "may now be repeated to show @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "an interesting paradox arises from the final result of the previous section for @xmath1 . because of the anomaly , a theory with a single quark flavor should have no light ( pseudo ) goldstone bosons , but only a heavy pseudoscalar , the @xmath13 . on the other hand , the s0.4expt  for a single rooted staggered flavor contains 16 pseudoscalars (  pions \" ) , of which only one , the taste - singlet , is heavy .",

    "in this section , i present a particular example to show in detail how the decoupling takes place at leading order in the chiral theory .",

    "we can now add the various contributions to @xmath242 , the fourier transform of @xmath212 , resulting in : @xmath243 the first line in comes from ( a ) and ( d ) , which give the @xmath244 and the @xmath192 terms , respectively ; the second line , from ( b ) , ( c ) , and their @xmath237 versions ; the last line , from ( e ) .",
    "note that the negative sign of the anomaly hairpin , , makes the second line negative and leads to the possibility of cancellations among the various light pions .",
    "it is not an accident that the hairpin is negative : it is required in order to give a positive mass to the @xmath13 when the geometric series of insertions is summed .",
    "using , from , @xmath245   = \\frac{1}{n_r}\\left [ \\left(\\left(p+q\\right)^2 + m^2_{\\eta'_i}\\right ) -   \\left(\\left(p+q\\right)^2 + m^2_i\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] one can rewrite in a form that shows more clearly how the continuum limit works : @xmath246 setting @xmath247 , the last line of vanishes immediately .",
    "the light pions then contribute only in the second line . in the continuum limit all 16 of the light masses",
    "@xmath223 become degenerate , and the two terms on the second line cancel also .",
    "the remainder , the first line , comes from the exchange of two heavy singlet mesons ( @xmath230 ) , and indeed has the same normalization as would be found for this correlation function using a continuum one - flavor chiral theory .",
    "this resolves the apparent one - flavor paradox , showing that it does not provide a counterexample to the arguments of this paper .",
    "with the usual assumption that taste symmetry is restored in the continuum limit for unrooted staggered quarks , @xmath25 becomes ordinary chiral perturbation theory for @xmath248 `` flavors '' in the continuum limit .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that , for a given combination of quark flavors , all 16 taste pions become degenerate in the continuum limit ( before the effects of the anomaly are included , which affects only the taste singlet , flavor singlet meson , as always ) . then taking @xmath17 order by order necessarily produces standard , continuum 0.4expt  for @xmath20 flavors .",
    "all existing s0.4expt  calculations @xcite have this expected continuum limit .",
    "the statement that @xmath249 is the correct chiral theory for @xmath29 ( for @xmath250 ) therefore has important implications for the validity of the rooting procedure itself .",
    "since s0.4expt  becomes standard 0.4expt  in the continuum limit , the low energy ( light pseudoscalar meson ) sector of @xmath20-flavor lattice qcd with rooted staggered quarks is , in the continuum limit , indistinguishable in its structure from that of ordinary @xmath20-flavor qcd .",
    "there are no violations of unitarity , and no introduction of unphysical nonlocal scales .",
    "of course , the chiral perturbation theory arguments presented in this paper do not address possible sickness due to rooting that would appear in sectors of the theory not described by 0.4expt .",
    "nevertheless , the extension of my arguments to at least some sectors other than that of the light pseudoscalar mesons seems possible . in particular , heavy - light physics can be described by the addition of a _ valence _ heavy quark with a nonstaggered action to the existing s0.4expt  framework @xcite .",
    "as such , the arguments in should also apply in the heavy - light case with @xmath0 sea quarks , implying that it too is free from unphysical effects in the continuum limit .",
    "further , i see no obvious problems with an extension to @xmath136 , since the heavy - quark can be treated by heavy quark effective theory at both the qcd and the chiral level , and thus does not introduce a new scale that would interfere with decoupling .",
    "the case of baryons , described by staggered heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , also seems straightforward for @xmath0 .",
    "however , the artifice of increasing the number of colors at the qcd level is not applicable in this case , because it changes the nature of the baryons .",
    "therefore , any counting arguments like those in would need to be performed at the chiral level only .",
    "in addition , it is not obvious that one can use decoupling to analyze the @xmath136 cases , since we would now have the baryon mass scale at the qcd level between @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "one _ caveat _ should be added to the discussion of this section : since the chiral expansion expresses physical quantities in terms of unknown lecs , the statement that s0.4expt  is valid does not by itself@xmath253 imply that the lecs generated by the rooted staggered theory take on their correct ( real qcd ) values in the continuum limit . on the other hand , in the four - flavor case we do know that the lecs are correct in the degenerate case .",
    "this follows from universality since the degenerate action is local .",
    "but the lecs are by definition mass independent , so if s0.4expt  is indeed the right chiral theory for four nondegenerate flavors , the lecs are _ per force _ also correct . with fewer than four flavors ,",
    "though , my assumptions on decoupling do not appear to be strong enough to continue to guarantee correct lecs .",
    "for that one would need to show universality at the lattice qcd level ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or to argue from the agreement of rooted staggered simulations with experiment @xcite . of course ,",
    "numerical checks against experiment are not proofs , and they run the risk , at least in principle , of confounding small violations of universality due to rooted staggered quarks with small violations of the standard model . such checks will become more convincing when one can see agreement between at least two different lattice fermion approaches .      in current dynamical staggered simulations @xcite , the fourth - root trick is applied to the sea quarks , while the valence quarks are described by ordinary staggered fields . in this section",
    ", i call this situation a `` rooted - staggered theory '' for simplicity .",
    "because valence and sea quarks are treated differently , it has been suggested @xcite that rooted - staggered theories fall into the class called `` mixed , '' where the valence and sea quarks have fundamentally different lattice actions .",
    "in mixed theories the mass renormalizations of sea and valence quarks are different , meaning in particular that there is no simple way to ensure that sea and valence quarks have the same physical mass .",
    "further , the continuum symmetries that would rotate valence and sea quark into each other are violated by discretization effects .",
    "this implies , for example , that even if the quark masses are adjusted to make the mass of a meson with two valence quarks equal to the mass of a meson with two sea quarks , the mass of a meson with one valence and one sea quark will be different by @xmath254 or @xmath255 terms .",
    "such terms show up in new operators in the 0.4expt  for the mixed theory @xcite .",
    "i claim , however , that the rooted - staggered case is not a mixed case , but in fact resembles much more closely a partially quenched theory , where the symmetries between valence and sea quarks are violated only by explicit differences in quark masses .",
    "first of all , i sketch a proof that the renormalization of sea and valence quark masses are the same to all orders in ( weak - coupling ) perturbation theory .",
    "imagine we have determined the mass counterterm for a valence quark up to an including a given order in perturbation theory .",
    "i need to show that the same mass counterterm will work to renormalize the mass on a sea quark line that appears as a loop inside some other diagram .",
    "go inside the diagram , and draw a box around a self - energy insertion on a sea quark line . as remarked in",
    ", the replica trick shows that the rooting procedure simply multiplies each sea quark loop by @xmath11 in perturbation theory , so the self - energy insertion as well as the associated mass counterterms on that line are all multiplied by the same overall factor of @xmath11 , compared to the corresponding self - energy insertion and mass counterterms on a valence line .",
    "thus the same counterterms work in both cases .",
    "of course there may be additional factors of 1/4 for any sea quark loops that appear in sub - sub - diagrams . but these will be the same for a sea quark line as for a valence line .",
    "the argument in the proceeding paragraph is based on weak - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "could there be `` mixed effects '' that show up only nonperturbatively ?",
    "i can not answer that question for general nonperturbative effects , but i can answer it  modulo the assumptions in  for the large class of effects described by the chiral theories .",
    "the appropriate chiral theory is @xmath31 , which is obtained order by order from @xmath256 .",
    "the latter theories have symmetries interchanging valence and sea quarks . for @xmath96 flavors of valence staggered quarks",
    ", the full symmetry group is in fact @xmath257 .",
    "the taste symmetries are broken on the lattice at @xmath255 , but the `` flavor subgroup '' @xmath258 is exact up to quark mass terms .",
    "extra chiral operators that would split valence - sea mesons from sea - sea or valence - valence mesons are forbidden by these symmetries . since",
    "such operators are absent for all @xmath14 , they can have no effect when we take @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , corresponding sea - sea , valence - valence , and valence - sea mesons are all degenerate ( when the quark masses are degenerate ) in @xmath256 , and therefore in @xmath31 .",
    "thus , at least within the context of chiral perturbation theory , the rooted - staggered theory behaves like a partially quenched theory , _ not _ like a mixed theory .",
    "one does have to be careful in defining the word `` corresponding '' in the previous paragraph .",
    "the valence sector of a rooted - staggered theory is `` richer '' than the sea sector , in that it includes particles in the continuum limit whose sea - sector analogues have decoupled from the physical theory .",
    "this is not surprising , since the purpose of the fourth root is to reduce four sea quark tastes to one , and there is no fourth root taken in the valence sector .",
    "a simple example of this behavior can be seen from the result in .",
    "if one adds together the valence contractions in without the extra factor of @xmath185 relating the last two terms to the first , then one gets a valence green s function with no sea - quark analogue .",
    "intermediate light ( pseudo - goldstone ) mesons will appear as intermediate states of this green s function in the continuum limit . in this sense , the rooted - staggered theory , is inherently `` partially quenched , '' even in limit of equal valence and sea masses .",
    "in a normal partially quenched theory , one can always take more valence quarks than there are sea quarks , so one has the option of creating valence states that have no analogue in the sea - quark sector .",
    "the main difference here is that one has no choice in the matter : the physical sea - quark subspace is always a proper subspace of the complete theory in the continuum limit .",
    "under certain assumptions that i repeat below , i have shown in this paper that staggered chiral perturbation theory ( s0.4expt ) correctly describes the low energy physics of four or fewer flavors of rooted staggered quarks .",
    "the s0.4expt  theory @xmath31 takes into account the fourth - root procedure by the replica trick ( or equivalently , by quark - flow analysis ) . at finite lattice spacing ,",
    "s0.4expt  reproduces unphysical features of the rooting that may perhaps best be described as violations of unitarity , with unwanted intermediate states contributing to amplitudes .",
    "this is clearly seen in ref .",
    "@xcite or in the example presented in @xcite .",
    "because s0.4expt  becomes standard 0.4expt  in the continuum limit , the unitarity violations seen in s0.4expt  at nonzero @xmath10 must go away when @xmath259 .",
    "if s0.4expt  is indeed the correct chiral theory for rooted staggered quarks , then this implies that the low energy ( pseudoscalar meson ) sector of lattice qcd with rooted staggered quarks is , in the continuum limit , indistinguishable in its structure from that of ordinary qcd .",
    "there are no violations of unitarity , and no introduction of unphysical nonlocal scales .",
    "this would not , by itself , show that the rooting procedure is valid , because there could be problems in sectors of the theory not described by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , it would significantly reduce the possible ways in which rooted staggered quarks could go wrong .",
    "my s0.4expt  results also give support to the statement that the theory with staggered valence quarks and rooted staggered sea quarks is not a `` mixed '' theory . like a partially quenched theory with the same action for the valence and sea quarks ,",
    "the rooted staggered theory has flavor symmetries rotating sea and valence quarks into each other .",
    "these symmetries may be broken in the usual way by mass terms , but they are not broken by lattice corrections .",
    "the starting point of my argument was the observation that four flavors of degenerate staggered quarks simply reduce to a single flavor when the fourth root of the determinant is taken . to make use of this observation",
    ", i needed several assumptions , the most important of which are :    * the taste symmetry is restored in the continuum limit of the normal , unrooted staggered theory .",
    "* the difference @xmath64 $ ] between the s0.4expt  theory for four flavors @xmath42 and the true chiral theory @xmath43 is analytic in @xmath7 ( for space - time independent @xmath7 ) , up to possible isolated singularities . * as a single quark mass ( `` charm '' ) is increased beyond the point at which it has decoupled from the chiral theory to a scale much larger than the lattice cutoff , the low energy physics of @xmath52 is unaffected , except perhaps by renormalizations of the lecs .",
    "i consider assumption 1 ) to be noncontroversial , and there is a lot of numerical evidence for it , but it has not been rigorously proven .",
    "the renormalization group methods of shamir @xcite seem to me the best way to make progress on this issue .",
    "assumption 2 ) is used in to move from degenerate to nondegenerate masses in the four - flavor case .",
    "the most important `` obstruction '' here would seem to be the possible existence an essential singularity in @xmath64 $ ] at @xmath63 ; i speculate below on how this possibility might be eliminated .",
    "note that the existence of such singularity immediately would imply that s0.4expt  is incorrect .",
    "a second way the assumption could be violated would be the presence of a phase boundary at a finite distance from @xmath63 .",
    "this would imply the existence of a region of mass differences in which s0.4expt  is valid , and another region of larger mass differences in which s0.4expt  is invalid .",
    "generically , i would expect an abrupt change like this to cause significant effects that would likely have been noticed in simulations if they occurred within the parameter ranges studied . both types of potential analyticity violations certainly merit further investigation , however .",
    "assumption 3 ) allows me in to extend the result in the four - flavor case to the more interesting cases with fewer than four light flavors . it should be possible to test this assumption numerically by simulating a four - flavor theory in appropriate mass range and seeing if it is describable at low energy by the proper chiral theory with a decoupled charm quark , @xmath147 .",
    "such tests are under consideration by the milc collaboration and may be performed in the near future .",
    "the main uncertainty is the precision at which these tests could be made , which would strongly influence how convincing they would be .    to investigate a possible essential singularity ,",
    "i restrict myself to diagonal sources , constant in space - time . in other words ,",
    "i consider a function @xmath82 of the four mass differences from the degenerate mass @xmath48 . to correspond with the previous notation , i write @xmath260 , with @xmath261 and @xmath262 . considering @xmath263 to be complex",
    ", the arguments in still go through formally , although one may want to put the system in finite volume to avoid any dangers from @xmath264 with constant sources .",
    "we then have a complex function @xmath265 , all of whose complex derivatives vanish at @xmath266 .",
    "this would forbid essential singularities in @xmath265 , which do not have well - defined complex derivatives .",
    "what would be needed to make such an argument reasonably rigorous ? on the s0.4expt  side , we are defining @xmath42 in ( chiral ) perturbation theory , so i do not expect problems at any finite order in adding small , complex @xmath267 to the masses in euclidean space . on the other hand , we do not know what @xmath43 is _ a priori _ , so we would need to add @xmath267 to the masses in the qcd - level theory @xmath52 . the main problem there seems to be that a complex @xmath263 makes the determinant complex .",
    "the issue of how one chooses the phase of the fourth root thus becomes relevant , as it is for the case of nonzero chemical potential @xcite .",
    "unlike the chemical potential case , however , the imaginary part of @xmath267 adds a constant amount to all eigenvalues of flavor @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath267 may be taken very small , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  much less than both @xmath48 and @xmath268 .",
    "i am hopeful therefore that any phase ambiguities can be shown to be manageable , but that remains to be seen .",
    "a further difficulty could come in trying to `` match '' @xmath52 onto @xmath42 in order to turn statements about smoothness of each theory separately into statements about @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "i conclude with a two additional comments :    * because the `` wrong '' mesons , which may be lighter than the physical states , contribute to correlation functions at nonzero lattice spacings in s0.4expt , the infinite - distance limit of some quantities may not commute with the continuum limit .",
    "this order of limits issue is very similar to that concerning the chiral and continuum limits , described in ref .",
    "it is not a practical problem , since of course only finite distances are relevant to simulations , and the extrapolation can be taken in the proper order with the aid of s0.4expt .",
    "* there is nothing in my argument that @xmath42 is the correct chiral theory for four flavors of fourth - rooted staggered quarks that is really dependent on the fact that we are taking the _ fourth _ root .",
    "the same arguments would also imply that @xmath269 is the chiral theory for three flavors of staggered quarks for which the _ third _ root is taken !",
    "the decoupling arguments in ( which presumably still apply ) would say further that @xmath270 gives the chiral theory for @xmath271 flavors of third - rooted staggered fields .",
    "there is no contradiction here : @xmath270 describes a sick theory , _ even in the continuum limit _ , except for the uninteresting case of 3 degenerate flavors . since",
    "a staggered field always has four tastes , only a fourth ( or square ) root the root can describe an integer number of flavors ( and therefore a local action ) in the continuum limit .",
    "the @xmath1 example from provides a simple illustration : the contributions from light pions in the second and third lines of vanish in the continuum if and only if @xmath272 .",
    "( i ignore the trivial case @xmath273 , as well as @xmath274 , which violates the spin - statistics theorem . )",
    "even @xmath275 leaves some light - pion contributions , as it should since that is really a two - flavor case .",
    "i am very grateful to maarten golterman and yigal shamir for extensive discussions , invaluable suggestions , and careful readings of the manuscript , as well as for a question by maarten on whether the rooted staggered case should be considered a mixed theory , which started me thinking along the present lines .",
    "i also thank jon bailey , carleton detar , urs heller , andreas kronfeld , as well as other milc and fermilab colleagues , for helpful comments and questions .",
    "finally , i am indebted to carl bender for discussions on analyticity and high orders of perturbation theory .",
