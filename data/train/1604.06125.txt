    "there are already some important studies on a collective coordinate quantization approach to the skyrme model with nonrelativistic  @xcite and relativistic treatment  @xcite which have as a goal an explanation of some basic properties of hadrons .",

    "there is no straightforward procedure how to obtain a suitable parametrization of the zero modes for @xmath23 , however , one can not exclude that such a parametrization exists .    in this paper , we shall deal with a slightly different parametrization of the field variable @xmath17 , namely , with the hermitian variable @xmath24 obtained as a result of transformation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a diagonal constant matrix @xmath27 .",

    "let us note that for the variable @xmath17 in the lagrangian ( [ actionp ] ) the boundary conditions which result in @xmath72 break partially the symmetry associated with the transformation @xmath18 .",
    "unlike for the standard skyrmion , where the chiral field @xmath73 goes to @xmath74 and the symmetry is simply broken down to @xmath75 , the @xmath76 has a nontrivial value which depends on winding numbers . moreover",

    "the symmetry transformation becomes diagonal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 , and then an explicit form of @xmath20 can be easily determined as expansion in basis of the standard gell - mann matrices .",
    "it is worth it to stress that for the planar case the classical equations of motion and their classical solutions have exactly the same form for both parametrizations .",
    "furthermore , since the quantization procedure is based on properties of classical solutions then the resulting quantum spectra must correspond .",
    "the variable @xmath24 has close relation with a well - known hermitian projector @xmath78 that satisfies @xmath79 the projector @xmath78 is defined as @xmath80 where the symbol @xmath81 stands for the @xmath6-component complex vector @xmath82 which depends on two variables @xmath83 .",

    "for this reason it does not contribute to the classical equations of motion . on the contrary , @xmath4 is trivial for @xmath3 and therefore the hopf term is not a homotopic invariant in this case .",
