    "the first - principle electronic structure calculation , based on the local - density approximation ( lda ) within the density - functional theory ( dft ) ,  @xcite has had great success in theoretical investigations of the ground state property of condensed matters .",

    "the electronic structure in strongly correlated electron systems has been highly challenging field .",
    "the self - coulomb and self - exchange interactions almost cancel with each other in many cases of the lda but still not completely in _ t_o .",

    "@xcite it gives satisfactory results for the band gap and magnetic moments in the transition metal monoxides _",
    "t_o ( tr = mn , fe , co , and ni ) except vo .",
    "the lda+u method  @xcite works reasonably well for the mott - hubbard insulators or rare earth metal compounds where the 3@xmath1 or 4@xmath4 bands are partially filled .",
    "the lda+u method is a static limit of the gw approximation ( gwa ) .",
    "@xcite however , application of the lda+u method to early transition metal monoxides tio and vo would lead to antiferromagnetic insulators rather than paramagnetic metals .",
    "@xcite    the gwa is the first term approximation of the many - body perturbation series for the green function , and is a simple but excellent method to calculate the self - energy with the dynamical correlation .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the hf approximation overestimates the band gap in insulators and semiconductors because of the lack of the screening terms and gives zero density of states at the fermi level in the electron gas . in the gwa , there is no self - interaction because the exchange term of the gwa is of the hartree - fock type .",
    "the dynamical correlation effect in the gwa is treated by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . in the gwa ,",
    "the dynamical effects give rise to important features that are not accounted for by the hf approximation , for example , damping of quasiparticles and characteristic structure in the spectral function .",
    "the screening effects recover the finite density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the band gap is corrected and reduced in the gwa by the dynamical screening effects in comparison with the one of the hf approximation .",
    "the dynamical correlation effect is important for the band width in the transition metals .",
    "@xcite we could not expect improvement in the gwa for the exchange splitting and satellite structure because it needs higher order diagrams ( e.g. , vertex corrections ) for electron - electron and hole - hole scattering processes .",
    "@xcite the gwa has been applied to several real systems , for example , simple metals ,  @xcite semiconductors and insulators ,  @xcite transition metals ,  @xcite and transition metal monoxides .",
    "@xcite in simple metals and semiconductors , the gwa can be formulated with plane wave basis set based on the pseudopotential method and the plasmon pole approximation has been often used for calculating dielectric function .",
    "@xcite in contrast , transition metals and their compounds have strong atomic potentials and the gwa based on the pseudopotential method can not be applied because of restriction of the number of plane waves .",
    "it is essentially important to include core electrons in many cases and , moreover , the plasmon pole approximation is not applicable to the dielectric function for transition metals and their compounds because there is no isolated plasmon pole .",
    "therefore , all - electron calculation and no plasmon - pole approximation in the dielectric function are required for transition metals and their compounds .",
    "the gw calculation of ni , based on the linearized augmented - plane - wave ( lapw ) basis and no approximation in the dielectric function , gives results in good agreement with experiments .",

    "@xcite in the pioneering work of the gw calculation of nio by aryasetiawan , the band gap and magnetic moment agree quite well with experimental values .",
    "@xcite in the analysis of photoemission spectroscopy by the cluster configuration - interaction theory , nio is assigned as a charge - transfer type insulator ,  @xcite but in the lda it is classified as a mott - hubbard type insulator because the transition metal 3@xmath1 bands appear at higher energy than oxygen 2@xmath0 bands .",
    "@xcite the relative position of the oxygen 2@xmath0 states of the gwa is also improved in comparison with that of the lda .",
    "however , the top of the valence bands in the gwa is mainly ni 3@xmath1 states and nio could not be a charge - transfer type insulator .    in most gw calculations , full self - consistency",
    "is not carried out .",
    "the self - consistency in the gw calculations can maintain the conservation laws of particle number , energy , and momentum .",
    "@xcite however such treatment can not guarantee better agreement with experimental results .",
    "@xcite because it is derived from many - body perturbation theory , the gwa is applicable to wide variety of classes of systems , and should be tested in various systems . in this paper ,",
    "the gw method based on the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method  @xcite is applied to several non - magnetic oxides , insulating mgo , cao and metallic tio , vo . only the electronic structure in mgo was calculated by the gwa before .",

    "we will discuss the electronic band structure and its systematic variation for mgo , cao , tio , and vo , concerning with the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation , band gap , band width , the density of states , plasmon frequencies , structures in the energy loss spectrum , and other properties .",
    "we will also discuss the correlation effects , including the strength of the coulomb interaction with @xmath1-@xmath1 screening effects .",

    "we present our summary .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tio3dtbl ]    the position of oxygen 2@xmath8 band is pushed down in the gwa so it is close to the experimental value .",
    "the lda makes the core or semicore states locate into shallow energy regions , compared with experiments , because the lda potential contains self - interaction .",
    "the self - energy and the correction @xmath9 to the lda energy of mgo are shown in the left side of fig .",
    "[ inssele ] .",
    "the gap at the top of the valence bands ( the energy zeroth ) is seen in the self - energy and as a result the energy correction @xmath9 has the discontinuity . in conduction bands , fluctuations of @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "are caused by different orbital characters , but the correction terms @xmath12 converge to almost constant value .",
    "the correction terms of the highest valence band @xmath13 and those of the lowest conduction band @xmath14 are as follows : in mgo , @xmath13 = @xmath15@xmath16 and @xmath14 = @xmath17@xmath18 ; in cao , @xmath13 = @xmath19@xmath15 and @xmath14 = @xmath20@xmath21 .",

    "the reduction of the band gap from the hf result to the static cohsex result and that from the static cohsex result to the gw result are attributed to the static screening effect and the dynamical screening effect , respectively .",
    "therefore , in mgo and cao , the static screening is the major contribution rather than the dynamical effects .",
    "the valence band width is 5.6  ev in mgo , and 3.4  ev in cao in the static cohsex approximation . in the gwa",
    "the valence band width is slightly reduced in comparison with the static cohsex approximation .",
    "the reduction from that of the hf approximation to that of the static cohsex approximation is much larger in mgo , because of the large difference of electronegativity and resultant importance of the static screening .",
    "the comparison of the band width by the gwa with that by the static cohsex approximation clearly shows that the dynamical effects are appreciable in the electron - electron correlation .",

    "a real gap of about 2  ev in tio and that of about 1.5  ev in vo can be seen between this bonding states ( mainly oxygen 2@xmath0 ) and the antibonding states ( mainly transition metal 3@xmath1 ) at around @xmath24 . the occupied conduction states are heavily dominated by transition metal 3@xmath1 orbitals .    the band width of metal 3@xmath1 states becomes narrower in the gwa than in the lda .",

    "@xcite    in tio and vo the width of oxygen 2@xmath0 valence band in the gwa becomes narrower in comparison with that of the lda , which is not the case in mgo and cao .",
    "the hybridization is very small in mgo and cao . in tio and vo , the hybridization between the transition metal 3@xmath1 and oxygen 2@xmath0 increases due to deepening metal 3@xmath1 states with the increase of the @xmath1 electron",
    "once one adopts the gwa , the wave functions of valence bands are localized more due to the screening effects and the width of the band around @xmath28  ev becomes narrower .",
    "then the conduction bands are lifted to higher energy side , relative to the lower energy oxygen @xmath29 ( bonding ) band in tio and vo .",
    "the effects of the reduction of the conduction ( transition metal @xmath30 ) band width also causes the increasing the separation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 states .",
    "the position of oxygen 2@xmath8 band is also pushed down by the gw correction , and this is caused by the self - interaction correction as in mgo and cao .    the self - energy and the correction @xmath9 to the lda energy of tio are shown in the right side of fig .",

    "then the correlation term @xmath40 is @xmath41  ev in tio and @xmath42  ev in vo .",

    "the band width of the static cohsex approximation does not become narrower appreciably in comparison with the lda results .",

    "when the interband transition exists at lower energy side of the plasmon frequency , the frequency of vanishing @xmath46 shifts towards higher frequency side .",
