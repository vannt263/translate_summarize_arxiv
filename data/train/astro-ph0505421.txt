    "an important aspect of understanding underlying astrophysical reasons for galaxy formation and evolution involves studying the relative distribution of red ( early - type ) and blue ( late - type ) galaxies , as a function of the galaxy environment .",
    "observational measurements of this so - called density - morphology relation suggest evidence that early - type galaxies are predominantly found in dense environments such as galaxy groups and clusters ( dressler 1980 ; goto et al .",
    "2003 ) evidence also suggests that the formation of early - type galaxies predates the formation of galaxy clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the era of wide - field galaxy surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al . 2001 ) or the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , detailed statistics on galaxy types and their environments allow one to now construct detailed models related statistics of galaxy types and where these galaxies are located . these models may then aid in explaining the underlying reasons for the occurrence of galaxy types and their preferred environments with initial conditions given by the primordial density fluctuations and cosmological parameters that determine the expansion .",
    "following these lines , numerical and semi - analytical models of galaxy formation are generally pursued to model and understand galaxy statistics including luminosity functions , occurrence of galaxy types , their spatial distribution , and clustering properties .",
    "while initial conditions and background cosmology are known adequately , these techniques are yet to describe statistical measurements of the galaxy distribution with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the main unknown here comes from our limited understanding of gastrophysics involving how baryons cool to form stars and how the formation of stars and their evolution , including the stellar end products , may lead to various feedback processes that affect subsequent starformation . the standard _",
    "text book _ description of galaxy formation involves gas first heating to virial temperature during the formation of dark matter halos and subsequently cooling at halo centers to form stars ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; white & rees 1978 ) a characteristic scale in galaxy formation is then related to the amount of gas , basically within the `` cooling radius '' , that can cool within the hubble time given a mass scale for the halo .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2001 ) and direct hydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy distribution ( e.g. , kay et al .",
    "2002 ) generally over predict the number of galaxies both at the low - end and the high - end of the galaxy luminosity function . the bright - end of the lf is always associated with the `` over cooling problem '' in numerical simulations ( balogh et al .",
    "2001 ) , where hot gas cools rapidly to form luminous galaxies at halo centers .",
    "the faint - end problem , involving a lack of faint galaxies in the observed lf , is generally explained as due to a feed back process during the era of reionization ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) when primordial galaxies started to form .",
    "models are generally evoked to expel gas from halos , such as through heating associated with reionization or a first generation of supernovae ( e.g. , bullock et al .",
    "2000 ; benson et al . 2002 ) , but the gas expelled from small halos settle eventually in more massive halos and cool to form bright central galaxies with luminosities exceeding those observed ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2003 ) .    ignoring galaxy growth through continuous cooling of hot gas , in cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005a ) , the central galaxy luminosity growth , as a function of the halo mass was explained based on a simple description for galaxy merging to the halo center with an efficiency determined by the dynamical friction alone .",
    "these models also lead to a characteristic scale in the galaxy formation reflected in terms of a flattering of the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass , or @xmath0 relation , as the halo mass is increased .",
    "this characteristic luminosity is associated with a critical mass scale when the dynamical friction time scale becomes close to or exceed the hubble time . in cooray & milosavljevic ( 2005b ) , a model for the lf of galaxies that relied primarily on this relation , and to a lesser extent on the relation between total galaxy luminosity in a given halo and",
    "it s halo mass , was used to show that this characteristic luminosity is same as @xmath1 in the lf , when the lf is described with the schechter ( 1976 ) form of @xmath2 .",
    "the success in describing the lf of galaxies using the @xmath0 relation and it s scatter led to the conclusion that the @xmath1 in the luminosity function is not a reflection of efficiency associated with gas cooling as has been argued in the past based on traditional models of galaxy formation dominated by hot gas cooling in dark matter halos ( e.g. , dekel 2004 ) .",
    "the characteristic luminosity is rather due to decreasing efficiency of dissipationless merging of galaxies to a central galaxy as hierarchical structure formation builds up massive parent halos .",
    "other evidences for a departure from traditional ideas of galaxy formation and evolution comes from numerical simulations , where some simulations now suggest that gas , as dark matter halos virialize , never heat to the `` virial '' temperature completely , but rather , shock heating during virialization forms a bimodal temperature distribution ( dekel & birnboim 2004 ; keres et al . 2004 ) .",
    "binney ( 2004 ) suggested that only the colder component cools to form a galaxy , while the hotter component remains at the same temperature .",
    "there is a lower characteristic scale in galaxy formation associated with the mass scale where most gas is never shock heats and remains at the virial temperature , but rapidly cools at the center to form a galaxy .",
    "one - dimensional numerical simulation suggests this lower mass scale is @xmath3 m@xmath4 ( dekel 2004 ) . in this description for galaxy formation",
    ", galaxies in more massive halos can only grow in luminosity only through mergers with other galaxies . the dynamical friction process involved with merging produces a consistent @xmath0 relation that agrees with observations ( cooray & milosavljevi 2005a ) .",
    "the same relation , when combined with the mass function , leads to the lf , and can be fitted with the schechter ( 1976 ) form the exponential drop - off of the lf at the bright - end is reflection of the scatter in the @xmath0 relation ( cooray & milosavljevi 2005b ) .    here , we extend the model of cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b ) to describe galaxy statistics measured by the 2dfgrs survey .",
    "the main advantage of using 2dfgrs data is the availability of lf measured as a function of the galaxy type , and the environment , measured in terms of the galaxy overdensity over the volume determined by size scale of 8 @xmath5 mpc ( croton et al .",
    "the 2dfgrs data also allow measurements of the conditional luminosity function ( clf ; yang et al .",
    "2003b ) , the luminosity function of galaxies as a function of the halo mass ( yang et al , 2005 ) .",
    "our models on the clf can be directly compared to these measurements and interesting information on the relative distribution of galaxy types can be extracted from the data .    while not complicated as semi - analytical models of galaxy formation , the empirical modeling approach utilized here has the advantage that one is able to understand main ingredients that shape the clfs easily .",
    "the approach builds upon attempts by yang et al .",
    "( 2003b ) to describe the lf with clfs , but assuming schechter forms a priori for the clf , and approaches that are built upon the halo model for the galaxy distribution ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) , but now extended to discuss conditional functions ( zheng et al .",
    "2004 with the stellar mass function and zehavi et al .",
    "2004 in the case of clfs ) . while the halo model has been successfully used to describe statistics of the dark matter field ( such as clustering : seljak 2000 , peacock & smith 2000 or weak lensing : cooray et al .",
    "2000 , cooray & hu 2001 ) , and basic properties of galaxy clustering ( e.g. , scoccimarro et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is useful to consider more applications of this technique which can provide information on underlying physics related to the galaxy distribution .    here , we will separate our discussion to central and satellite galaxies and make few assumptions as possible through simple model descriptions . the motivation for the separation of galaxies to these two divisions",
    "are numerous : from the theoretical side , a better description of the galaxy occupation statistics is obtained when one separates to central and satellite galaxies ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2004 ) , while from observations , central and satellites galaxies are known to show different properties , such as color and luminosity ( e.g. , berlind et al . 2004 ) .",
    "our goal here is to consider an analytic description for the lf with built in model ingredients that recover the observations .",
    "we then argue that instead of attempting to understand mass - averaged statistics such as the lf , it may be best to reproduce main ingredients that shape clfs with numerical and semi - analytical models of galaxy formation in order to understand underlying physics .",
    "in the case of clfs , we will argue that the main ingredient is the @xmath0 relation , and in the case of galaxy types , a model on the fraction of early - type and late - type galaxies as a function of the halo mass .",
    "if these relations and their observed scatter can be explained with simple physics , then it is guaranteed that the lf would be recovered .    to model the environmental lf ( croton et al .",
    "2004 ) , we need information on the mass function of dark matter halos that corresponds to the environment of interest , whether it is a void or a dense region . since this information is not directly available under a simple model ( see , for example , mo et al .",
    "2004 and the approach there that utilized numerical simulations ) , here we make use of the observed measurements to extract information on these conditional mass functions .",
    "these mass functions , as well as related probabilities , then provide us with general information on how blue and red galaxies are distributed in the universe .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we will outline the basic ingredients in the empirical model for clfs and present a comparison to measurements using 2df data ( from yang et al . 2005 ) , both in terms of average number of galaxies and in terms of galaxy types . in section  3",

    "the central galaxy clf takes a log - normal form , while the satellite galaxy clf takes a power - law form in luminosity .",
    "such a separation describes the lf best , with an overall better fit to the data in the k - band as explored by cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b ) . while a previous attempt to describe clfs , as appropriate for 2dfgrs , involved a priori assumed schechter ( 1976 ) forms , we believe the description here is more appropriate .",
    "our motivation for log - normal distributions also come from measured conditional lfs , such as galaxy cluster lfs including bright galaxies , where data do require an additional log - normal component in addition to the schechter ( 1976 ) form ( trentham & tully 2002 ) . similarly , the stellar mass function , as a function of halos mass in semi - analytical models , is best described with a log - normal component for the central galaxies ( zheng et al .",

    "the scatter in the @xmath0 relation is captured through the dispersion @xmath15 of the log - normal distribution . in cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b ) , we found @xmath16 to describe the field - galaxy luminosity function in the k - band ( huang et al .",

    "incidently , a value for the dispersion of 0.17 is in good agreement with the value of 0.168 found for the dispersion of central galaxy luminosities by yang et al .",

    "this condition does not include the fact that at low mass halos , galaxy formation is inefficient and not all dark matter halos host a galaxy .",
    "this is equivalent to modifying the halo mass function at the low - mass end to select only halos that host a galaxy .",

    "when model fitting the lf , or the lf as a function of the environment , this description is unimportant as the central galaxies dominate galaxy statistics .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as discussed in cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b ) , the lf is dominated by central galaxies instead of satellites , which has also been noted by zheng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) when describing the stellar baryonic mass function .",
    "though @xmath37 does not matter for the lf , it is important when comparing the clf of galaxies in halos with a narrow mass range and when the clf is measured with central galaxies removed from the data . with regards to satellites , note that @xmath21 equals @xmath14 for @xmath44 , and thus @xmath45 at low halo masses .",
    "such halos only have a single galaxy , at the center of the halo .    in eq .",
    "[ eqn : clf ] , @xmath46 is taken to be a function of the halo mass . in cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005b )",

    "( 2004 ) , and we used that value in all mass scales there when modeling the k - band lf . here ,",
    "based on a comparison to clfs measured in the 2dfgrs galaxy group catalog , we find that @xmath46 is , in fact , a function of mass that varies from -1 at cluster scales to 0 at masses corresponding to groups with few galaxies .",
    "a similar mass dependent variations on the faint - end slope , parameterized by @xmath48 in schechter function forms for the clf was found by van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) when model fitting the clf using 2df lf and luminosity - dependent galaxy bias .",
    "while the differences associated with variations to the slope , as a function of mass , are significant when clfs between galaxy clusters and poor groups are considered , in the case of the lf , which averages over clfs of various mass scales , the difference resulting from either assuming a mass - dependent slope for @xmath49 or an average value , such as @xmath50 , is minor .",
    "again , this is due to the fact that the lf is dominated by central galaxies rather than the satellites .",
    "thus , we will set @xmath51 when calculating the lf and the environmental lfs in the present paper , but when describing the clfs of yang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we allow for a mass dependence for @xmath49 ( see , figure  3 ) .      here , in addition to the 2dfgrs lf , we will also model the lf of galaxy types , broadly divided in to two classes involving red , or early - type , and blue , or late - type , galaxies .",
    "a previous modeling of galaxy types using clfs is described in van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; our approach differs because of the overall division of the sample to central and satellite galaxies .",
    "thus , the division to two types applies to these two components , separately , in a given halo .",
    "as it is clear , the clfs we have developed facilitate this easy separation .",
    "as we find later by comparing to 2dfgrs data , central galaxies tend to be early - type when found in massive halos , corresponding to groups and clusters , but late - type when in low mass halos with a few or no satellites .",
    "thus , the division of central galaxies to the two types can simply be described as a function of mass .",
    "while we have extracted this division in a function form here , we have not investigated the underlying reasons how galaxy types in the center of halos change from primarily late to early type , as the halo mass function increases . the form is given and it remains to be seen if this analytical description is reproduced in numerical or semi - analytic models of galaxy formation or not .    in the case of satellites , a comparison to the 2dfgrs clfs measured by yang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows that the division to early- and late - type galaxies is simply not a function of mass alone , but rather a function of both mass and luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "for example , in low mass halos corresponding to galaxy groups , the low luminous satellites with luminosities less than 10@xmath52 l@xmath4 tend to be mostly late type or blue galaxies , while the bright satellites , with luminosities around 10@xmath53 l@xmath4 are dominated by early type or red galaxies .",
    "to describe these general behaviors , we consider the division of central and satellite conditional luminosity functions to early- and late - type separately , and write @xmath54 where the two functions that divide between early- and late - types are taken to be functions of mass , in the case of central galaxies , and both mass and luminosity in the case of satellites .",
    "note that these fractions are defined with respect to the total galaxy number of a halo .",
    "since the early- and late - type fractions should sum to unity , late - type fractions are simply @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] for central and satellite galaxies , respectively .",
    "given this simple dependence , we do not write late - type fractions separately .    in the case of central galaxies , we assume that there is a smooth transition between a dominant fraction of late - type to a dominant early - type fraction , as a function of the halo mass , as the halo mass is increased . a description that fits the 2dfgrs clfs of yang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) was @xmath57 \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath58 m@xmath4 and @xmath59 ; as the halo mass increased , a large width for the transition from predominantly late - type to early - type galaxies in the centers of massive halos results in an early - type fraction that never falls to unity or zero either of the two ends in the mass ranges of interest .    for satellites , at high mass halos",
    ", we found early type fraction to be roughly two - thirds while at the low mass end , this fraction decreases to around one - third . at the low end of halo masses where satellites are found , however , this fraction is luminosity - dependent . the model that describes",

    "this function varies between @xmath66 and @xmath67 when low - mass , low - luminosities to high - mass , high - luminosities .",
    "note that satellites are subhalos that have merged with a central halo .",
    "thus , before these galaxies became satellites .",
    "they were in fact central galaxies .",
    "thus , the fact that the fraction of early - to - late satellite galaxies is both mass and luminosity dependent should not be considered a drawback in this description or the halo approach to galaxy statistics in general .",
    "in fact , a model where redshift dependences are also included , including a merging hierarchy , one may able to start with simple a description for early - to - late type galaxy fraction that is mass dependent alone and understand how the merging of these galaxies result in the fractional dependence of early galaxies , say , as satellites in massive dark matter halos .",
    "clearly , such work follows underlying motivations of semi - analytical models of galaxy formation . here",
    ", we provide the relations that needed to be explored in such an approach .    in figure  1 , as a summary ,",
    "we show , as a function of the halo mass various fractions encountered in our model .",
    "note that the central galaxy fraction falls below unity at halo masses below 10@xmath28 m@xmath4 , which is due to the efficiency factor we included to account for the fact that not all halos at the low - end may host a galaxy .",
    "setting @xmath68 results in an over prediction for the abundance of galaxies at that low - luminosity end .",

    "we can not distinguish between the two possibilities ; but , it is likely that most selection biases are already accounted when constructing the lf and the effect we are seeing mostly is due to the fact that not all low mass dark matter halos host a galaxy .",

    "the total sample bias is close to that of late - type galaxies , while at the bright - end average bias for the whole sample is close to that of early - type galaxies .",
    "we also note an important differences in the bias when comparing satellite galaxies and central galaxies ; satellite galaxies , on avearge , have a higher bias factor at all luminosities when compared to central galaxies .",
    "this is due to the fact that satellite galaxies are preferentially in higher mass halos that are , on averge , biased higher with respect to the linear density field .",
    "the average bias factor , for the whole sample , however is dominated by central galaxies , for same reasons the lf is also dominated by central galaxies .",
    "bias measurements as a function of galaxy type exist in the form of clustering information such as the correlation length as a function of luminosity and type ( norberg et al .",
    "while we have not attempted to convert this clustering information to obtain bias @xmath106 as a function of galaxy type here , since it involves an additional step of modeling , our next improvement in this approach is to compute clustering statistics , in which case a direct comparison could easily be made .",

    "the motivation for such an assumption is inherent in the halo model ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) , where one makes the assumption that galaxy distribution can be associated with the halo mass rather than the environment .",
    "similarly , observational studies based on the sloan survey indicate that galaxy color may also be independent of the environment , implying that the clfs for galaxy types are not dependent on @xmath107 ( blanton et al .",
    "thus , given that @xmath8 is @xmath107 independent , all variations in @xmath110 must come from variations in the halo mass function , as a function of @xmath107 .",

    "in this paper , we have made use of the scaling relation between the central and the total galaxy luminosity of a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass , to construct the clf of galaxies .",
    "the clf provides a powerful technique to understand galaxy properties , especially on the spatial distribution of galaxies , in the era of wide - field large scale structure surveys where large galaxy samples can easily be subdivided with adequate statistics ( yang et al .",
    "the clf is closely related to the halo occupation number , which is the average number of galaxies given the halo mass ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) .",
    "the halo occupation number captures galaxy statistics that simply treat each galaxy in the sample equally and is useful when attempting to understand statistics such as galaxy clustering statistics , on average .",

    "this division is central to are arguments on how the clf is shaped and assumes that different physics govern the evolution of these two components . in our underlying physical description , following cooray & milosavljevi ( 2005a ) , central galaxies grow in luminosity through dissipationless merging of satellite galaxies .",
    "these satellites are both early- and late - types , with the fraction of early type galaxies taken to be dependent on both the halo mass and the satellite galaxy luminosity .",
    "underlying physical reasons for this dependence is not clear , but could very well associated with a tidal stripping effect that removes gas and the stellar content of late - type galaxies in more massive halos and convert these galaxies to early - types",
    ". it will be helpful to understand if numerical and semi - analytic models predict the fractions of late to early type galaxies , including the suggestion that the fraction in satellites changes at a luminosity around @xmath139 l@xmath4 from more late - types at lower luminosities than this value to more early - types .",
