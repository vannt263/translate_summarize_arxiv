    "since the box covering method is central to the understanding of the scale - invariant properties of networks , we describe it in more detail here .",

    "we tile the system by first assigning nodes 1 and 2 to the box colored in blue .",
    "notice that the maximum distance between the nodes of a given box is @xmath66 .",
    "thus , node 8 would not be in the blue box since its distance from node 2 is @xmath67 ( even though its distance from 1 is @xmath68 ) .",
    "then we cover the nodes 6 and 7 with the orange box , and the nodes 3 , 4 , and 5 with the red box .",
    "finally , the last node 8 is assigned to the green box .",
    "the number of boxes to cover the network is then @xmath69 .",
    "the renormalization is then applied by replacing each box by a single node .",
    "thus , nodes 1 and 2 will be combined into a single node as indicated by the arrow from the first panel to the second panel in fig .",
    "this renormalized node is connected with the orange and green boxes because there is a link between nodes 2 and 7 , and 1 and 8 , respectively .",
    "the same rule applies to the other boxes .",
    "the renormalized network is shown in the second panel .",
    "the system is then tiled again with boxes ; in this case two boxes ( blue and red ) are needed to cover the entire network .",
    "the two boxes are then replaced by nodes and a second renormalized network is obtained as shown in the third panel . finally , the last two nodes belong to the same ( red ) box and are replaced by a single node .",
    "this procedure is applied to the www in fig .",
    "the main panel corresponds to the first stage in the renormalization of the web for @xmath36 .",
    "the procedure is applied again obtaining the remaining panels in fig .",
    "[ web]b until the web is reduced to a single box in the last panel .",
    "the colors of the nodes corresponds to the boxes to which they belong .    in fig .",
    "[ fractal]d we show the invariance of the degree distribution @xmath6 under the renormalization performed as a function of the box size in the www .",
    "the other networks analyzed in this study present the same invariant property .",
    "it is important to mention that the networks are also invariant under multiple renormalizations applied for a fixed box size @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds , for instance , to the stages depicted in fig .",
    "[ web]a in the second row for @xmath36 for the network demo .",
    "figure [ pk1 ] shows the invariance of @xmath6 for the www after several stages of the renormalization for a fixed @xmath36 , and it is the analogous of fig .",
    "[ fractal]d for different box size .",
    "the stages 1 , 2 , and 3 correspond to the networks depicted in the first 3 stages in fig .",
    "[ web]b .    from the above explanation",
    "it should be clear that there are many ways to tile the network .",
    "for instance in fig .",
    "[ demo]b we show another tiling . in this case",
    "we assign nodes 4 and 7 together in a single box instead of nodes 6 and 7 as in fig .",
    "this tiling results in an extra box needed to cover node 6 and therefore in a larger number of nodes to tile the system , @xmath70 .",
    "while there are many ways to assign nodes to the boxes , we notice that the rigorous mathematical definition of eq .",
    "( [ dh ] ) corresponds to the _ minimum _ number of boxes needed to cover the network @xcite .",
    "this minimization does not have any consequence for the determination of the fractal dimension in homogeneous clusters .",
    "however , it may become relevant when calculating the self - similar exponent of a complex network with a _ widely _ distributed number of links . finding the minimum number of boxes to cover",
    "the network is a hard optimization problem to solve , analogous to the graph coloring problem in the np - complete complexity class .",
    "this minimization problem has to be solved by an exhaustive numerical search since there is no numerical algorithm to solve this kind of problems .",
    "we have performed the search over a limited part of the phase - space for the www to obtain an estimation of the average and the minimum number of boxes needed to tile the network for every value of @xmath11 .",
    "we find that the average value of the boxes is very close to the estimated minimum number of boxes .",
    "moreover , we find that the minimization is not relevant and any covering gives rise to the same exponent .",
    "the underlying meaning of the existence of scale - free networks which are self - similar is yet to be deciphered , but some insight can be gained by examining the simplest structure of a known network of that kind : a _ tree _ network which has been characterized using field theoretical arguments and fractal dimensions in @xcite .    the sequence of renormalization steps depicted in fig . [ web ] suggests the following scheme : one begins with a single node and then constructs the network by applying the renormalization procedure in a reversed fashion .",
    "this can be achieved by following the procedure in fig .",
    "[ web ] for a specific value of @xmath11 .",
    "more specifically , a single node with a large number of links is first connected to the next generation of nodes . for every node",
    "we assign a number of links from a power - law distribution with a given @xmath7 .",
    "the next layer of the tree is generated in the same way .",
    "a tree structure with a power - law degree distribution and self - similar topology emerges which is depicted in fig .",

    "[ tree]b where we study a scale - free tree structure with 192,827 nodes and @xmath71 , and we find @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the parallels between the features of such a simple structured network and those discussed in this paper suggest that this simplified view may lie at the core of more complex self - similar networks .",
    "moreover , we also calculate the average mass of the boxes and the mass of the clusters in the box covering method and the cluster covering method , respectively , and we find the power law of eq .",

    "however , we find that the distribution of @xmath77 remains a power law and the degree distribution @xmath6 is invariant under the renormalization suggesting that some self - similar properties might still be valid for the internet .",
    "we notice that internet maps are made by programs that use the ip protocol to trace the connections between each registered node in the internet .",
    "these maps are incomplete since they map a few routers from each domain and also due to the existence of firewalls .",
    "thus , the apparent lack of self - similarity might be due to incomplete information of the network .",

    "next we introduce an example of a model lacking self - similarity : the random scale - free model .",

    "<S> complex networks have been studied extensively due to their relevance to many real systems as diverse as the world - wide - web ( www ) , the internet , energy landscapes , biological and social networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of real networks are called `` scale - free '' because they show a power - law distribution of the number of links per node @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is widely believed that complex networks are not _ length - scale _ invariant or self - similar . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion originates from the `` small - world '' property of these networks , which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the `` diameter '' of the network @xcite , rather than the power - law relation expected for a self - similar structure . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , here we present a novel approach to the analysis of such networks , revealing that their structure is indeed self - similar . </S>",
    "<S> this result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure which coarse - grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given `` size '' . </S>",
    "<S> concurrently , we identify a power - law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box defining a finite self - similar exponent . </S>",
    "<S> these fundamental properties , which are shown for the www , social , cellular and protein - protein interaction networks , help to understand the emergence of the scale - free property in complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> they suggest a common self - organization dynamics of diverse networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together previously unrelated fields : the statistical physics of complex networks with renormalization group , fractals and critical phenomena </S>",
    "<S> .    two fundamental properties of real complex networks have attracted much attention recently : the small - world and the scale - free properties . </S>",
    "<S> many naturally occurring networks are small world since one can reach a given node from another one , following the path with the smallest number of links between the nodes , in a very small number of steps . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the so - called `` six degrees of separation '' in social networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is mathematically expressed by the slow ( logarithmic ) increase of the average diameter of the network , @xmath0 , with the total number of nodes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the _ shortest _ distance between two nodes and defines the distance metric in complex networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , we obtain : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a characteristic length .    </S>",
    "<S> a second fundamental property in the study of complex networks arises with the discovery that the probability distribution of the number of links per node , @xmath6 ( also known as the degree distribution ) , can be represented by a power - law ( scale - free ) with a degree exponent @xmath7 usually in the range @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9    these discoveries have been confirmed in many empirical studies of diverse networks @xcite . with the aim of providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism which leads to these common features one needs to probe the patterns within the network structure in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> the question of connectivity between groups of interconnected nodes on different length - scales has received less attention . </S>",

    "<S> here we show that real complex networks , such as www , social , protein - protein interaction networks ( pin ) and cellular networks are indeed constructed of self - repeating patterns on all length - scales , and are therefore invariant or self - similar under a length - scale transformation .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ smallworld ] ) with self - similarity , or in other words an underlying _ length_-scale - invariant topology ? at the root of the self - similar properties that we unravel in this study is a scale - invariant renormalization procedure which we show to be valid for dissimilar complex networks . in order to demonstrate this concept we first consider a self - similar network embedded in euclidean space , </S>",
    "<S> of which a classical example would be a fractal percolation cluster at criticality @xcite . in order to unfold the self - similar properties of such clusters we calculate the fractal dimension using a `` box counting '' method and a `` cluster growing '' method @xcite .    in the first method we cover the percolation cluster with @xmath10 boxes of linear size @xmath11 . </S>",
