    "scaling relationships play an important role in understanding the nature and behavior of galaxies .",
    "this is because it is often possible to infer properties that are difficult to measure ( such as stellar age ) from other , more readily available information ( such as metallicity fraction ) . while there are a number of scaling relations currently in use in modern astronomy , such as the faber - jackson law @xcite , the @xmath5-@xmath6 relationship @xcite , the fundamental plane @xcite , and the bulge black hole mass relation @xcite , rotationally dominated ( i.e. , spiral ) galaxies can be described by the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation .",
    "first measured by @xcite , the tf relation measures the correlation between a galaxy s total luminosity and maximum rotational velocity , finding that the brighter a galaxy is , the faster it rotates , leading to wider measured rotation curves .",
    "originally , the tf relation was measured using b - band luminosities @xcite , but a large dispersion around the fitted slope ( due primarily to dust extinction , scattering , and galactic attenuation ) somewhat limited its utility .",
    "later speculations suggested that longer - wavelength data , being less susceptible to extinction and recent star formation , would show a smaller dispersion @xcite , and this prompted the creation of tf relations in redder bands .",
    "in particular , there have been several tf relations constructed in both the optical ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the near - infrared ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the specific tf parameters ( slope and intercept of a linear fit ) vary from study to study , the tf scatter does generally decrease as the observed wavelength increases .    in this work ,",
    "we continue to extend the redward trend of tf relations , using luminosity data obtained from the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) satellite . like the previous 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , the _ wise _ mission was designed to image the entire sky in the ir regime . however , _",
    "wise _ is equipped with much redder bandpass filters ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath0 m ) , making it a mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) instrument .    at the very longest mid - ir wavelengths , photons from warm dust and gas",
    "dominate galaxy luminosity , rather than direct stellar emission .",
    "due to the spatially variable nature of dust in galaxies , tf relations constructed at these wavelengths may show significantly increased scatter , as the empirical relationship ( originally designed to match stellar luminosity and rotation ) is altered by this extra flux . in order to avoid this possibility",
    ", we only focus on the shortest _ wise _ bandpass ( 3.4 @xmath0 m ) , where , after fitting a 300 k blackbody spectrum to the mid - ir spectral energy distribution of a typical star forming galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we find that only 1% to 5% of the total emission at 3.4 @xmath0 m is due to dust .    by utilizing 3.4 @xmath0 m data , we are able to compare our results to the surprising 3.6 @xmath0 m tf relation presented in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "a mid - ir tf relation was constructed from a sample of eight galaxies cross - matched between the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "key project s cepheid distance sample @xcite and a catalog of nearby galaxies @xcite imaged with the _ spitzer space telescope_. ( two of these galaxies , ngc 4725 and ngc 7331 , are included in our final data set . ) without explicitly correcting for several systematic effects , the sample showed a remarkably small dispersion ( @xmath7 mags ) , opening up the possibility that the mid - ir tf relation could be used as a tool for measuring precision cosmological and distance parameters .",
    "however , as correctly noted in that paper , a much larger sample of galaxies  preferably containing objects with more commonly observed magnitudes  is needed to verify ( or reject ) this result . using data acquired from an all - sky instrument such as _ wise _ , we are in a prime position to attempt such a task .",
    "this paper , along with the preliminary work by @xcite and the work of @xcite , presents the first tf relationship constructed at mid - infrared wavelengths , and allows us to probe some empirical properties of galaxies in a regime where the oldest ( assuming inside - out growth of stellar mass ; e.g. , @xcite ) , most centrally - located stars make up a slightly more prominent fraction of the total luminosity @xcite .",
    "in addition to galaxy properties , however , the tf relation can also be used for cosmological purposes .",
    "specifically , the tf relation can be used to measure peculiar velocities , which can , when taken over a large enough volume , begin to constrain the dark matter distribution in the local universe . with a potentially lower tf scatter in the mid - ir , peculiar velocities can be more robustly determined , ultimately resulting in better dark matter mapping and an improved understanding of the nature of the universe s mass structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the data products ( magnitudes and line widths ) used in this work , along with the initial catalog and specific data cuts used to construct the final galaxy sample . in section 3 , we outline our tf analysis , highlighting several corrections designed to homogenize the galaxy sample .",
    "it is in this section where we present the final , best - fit _ wise _ tf relation .",
    "we discuss the results of the tf analysis in section 4 .",
    "specifically , we compare the parameters of _ wise _ tf to other near- and mid - ir tf relations and identify potential sources of intrinsic tf scatter at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "we briefly conclude in section 5 . additionally , technical details testing the accuracy of the peculiar velocity corrections , along with measurements showing the effects of the corrections on the final tf relation , are presented in an appendix .    throughout this work , we assume a hubble parameter @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc @xmath9 .",
    "all magnitudes are calculated in the vega system .",
    "we select the initial tf candidate galaxies by cross - matching magnitudes from the _ wise _ @xmath1 ( 3.4 micron ) all - sky data release catalog with rotational velocity ( line width ) measurements from the 2mass tully fisher ( 2mtf ; @xcite ) all - sky galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "while the complete 2mtf catalog contains line width measurements acquired from archival sources  the cornell digital archive @xcite and the hyperleda database @xcite  and new observational data from the green bank telescope and the parks radio telescope @xcite , we construct the _ wise _ tf relation using only the publicly available line width data ( i.e. , the cornell and hyperleda samples ) .",
    "although there are selection effects embedded in the overall archival catalogs ( due to the heterogeneous nature of how they were compiled ) , the subset of the data comprising the 2mtf sample is specifically designed to be complete down to magnitude @xmath10 , minimizing any potential selection bias .",
    "we explicitly exclude galaxies in a related catalog , the 2mtf `` galaxy template '' sample @xcite from our final data set , as this sample will be analyzed separately in a companion paper .",
    "because the remaining `` non - template '' 2mtf galaxies cover a larger area of the sky , include a wider range of environments ( from clusters , to groups , to field galaxies ) , and span a similar redshift range ( @xmath11 ) , removing the galaxy template sample from our analysis will not bias the final results .    in the _",
    "wise _ catalog , magnitudes of resolved 2mass galaxies are measured using an elliptical aperture designed to mimic the size and shape of a given galaxy .",
    "this is achieved by convolving the galaxy s shape , as measured in the 2mass extended source catalog @xcite , with the _ wise _ @xmath1 point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "this particular magnitude , called _ w1gmag _ , captures more light than the standard , profile - fit magnitude _ w1mpro _",
    "( optimized for measuring point - sources ) and is less sensitive to systematics from inclination effects .",
    "while a _ w1gmag _ magnitude can underestimate the true magnitude by as much as 20% , this is a significant improvement over _ w1mpro _ , which typically underestimates extended source flux by 60 - 80% .",
    "this underestimation is encoded in the final magnitude uncertainty .",
    "we note that alternatives to _ w1gmag _ are also in development ( see e.g , @xcite ) which may provide improved magnitude estimates . in particular , an isophotal curve - of - growth analysis ( combined with the careful removal of foreground stellar light ) yields @xmath1 galaxy magnitudes that are on average @xmath12 mags brighter than their _",
    "w1gmag _ counterparts ( t. jarrett and m. bilicki , private communication ) .",
    "we can therefore revisit the issue of galaxy photometry when these alternative catalogs are released publicly .",
    "however , with a potential scatter of only @xmath13 mags relative to the _ w1gmag _",
    "values , these updated measurements will not significantly affect the tf slope or dispersion parameters in our analysis ( section [ tf_construction ] ) .",
    "after the initial cross - matching , we begin with a set of 1929 galaxies .",
    "however , in order to improve the quality of the sample we apply a number of data cuts . only galaxies with the highest line width quality flags ( `` g '' from the archive and `` a '' from the hyperleda data ; see @xcite and @xcite , respectively for flag descriptions ) are kept , as these are most accurate measurements for tf purposes . to reduce the intrinsic scatter of the line width measurement",
    ", we apply a signal - to - noise cutoff of @xmath14/width @xmath15 , and also reject galaxies with an inclination angle less than @xmath16 .",
    "inclination angles are derived from the axis ratio of each galaxy , but rather than measuring these quantities directly from the _ wise _ catalog , we instead use the optical ( v - band ) axis ratios presented in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "this is done so that the axis ratio is optimized to measure the bluer disk light rather than the redder bulge light , which often underestimates ellipticity .",
    "a morphology cut is also applied to the data , to ensure that we only select rotationally - supported galaxies in the final sample . specifically , we select galaxies classified between type s0 ( t @xmath17 ) and sd ( t @xmath18 ) , using the de vaucouleurs t - type classification scheme .",
    "morphology information is taken from the cfa redshift catalog ( zcat ; @xcite ) .",
    "after applying all cuts , we are left with 568 galaxies in the final sample . while the overall number has been dramatically reduced , the physical characteristics of the remaining galaxies are not significantly different from the original population .",
    "in particular , shapes of galaxy magnitude , line width , and recessional velocity distributions remain the same before and after the cuts are applied , and the final sample still covers a large area across the sky . because of this , we are confident that the reduced data set is not fundamentally different from the full set , and analysis of the final galaxy sample will yield robust results",
    ".    a map of the positions of sample galaxies ( in galactic coordinates ) , along with a redshift distribution histogram can be seen in figure [ fig : galaxy_distrib ] . since , as mentioned above , we do not use the 2mtf galaxy sample observed with the parkes telescope @xcite , our sample is artificially cut off at @xmath19 declination . in the lower panel , both the pre - cut ( green ) and post - cut ( blue ) redshift distributions are shown , highlighting the fact that our cuts do not significantly bias the physical properties of the galaxy sample .",
    "the observed redshift of the sample extends to 14000 km s@xmath9 ( @xmath20 ) .     to improve the contrast of the distribution . *",

    "before attempting to fit a tf relation to our galaxy sample , we first apply a number of corrections to ensure homogeneity . we now briefly describe each of these corrections , and our specific methods for implementing them .",
    "first , we apply several photometric corrections to the observed apparent magnitudes of the sample . in all cases ,",
    "the distance modulus required for converting a galaxy s apparent magnitude into the absolute frame is the largest correction , but there are a number of smaller corrections necessary as well .",
    "these include adjustments for peculiar velocity ( @xmath22 ) , galactic extinction ( @xmath23 ) , and internal absorption ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we now describe each of these processes",
    ".      in the nearby universe ( @xmath25 ) , the peculiar velocity of a galaxy ( i.e. additional speed and direction relative to the hubble flow ) , is typically on the order of 200 km s@xmath9 @xcite . over the distance range of the _ wise _ tf galaxy sample , this translates to a ( cosmological ) redshift uncertainty between 1.4 and 100% , giving rise to an additional 0.03 to 1.5 magnitudes of scatter in the tf relation .",
    "removing the effects of this peculiar motion should , therefore , reduce the observed scatter . in this work",
    ", we achieve this by applying the peculiar velocity model of @xcite to each galaxy .",
    "since the @xcite model is coarsely sampled , with peculiar velocity values only reported at regular ( 5 mpc x 5 mpc x 5 mpc ) intervals in cartesian supergalactic space , we rely on interpolation to improve the model s utility .",
    "in particular we apply a 3rd - order , bicubic spline interpolation scheme to the model grid so that we are able to apply a unique peculiar velocity value at the coordinates of each sample galaxy .",
    "systematic tests assessing the accuracy of our spline interpolation scheme can be seen in the appendix .",
    "the model provides an estimate of total velocity ( @xmath26 ) as a function of hubble flow velocity ( @xmath27 ) for any supergalactic ( sgl , sgb ) position .",
    "we therefore interpolate over the inverse function , @xmath28 , ( assuming @xmath29 , the galaxy s observed redshift velocity ) to remove the effects of peculiar velocity .",
    "the cmb reference frame is used throughout this process .    while , in general , it is not always possible to uniquely invert the total velocity function due to complications from the `` triple - value problem '' ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , we find @xmath26 to be monotonic with redshift for all galaxies in our sample , resulting in an unambiguous hubble flow velocity measurement every time .",
    "the @xmath27 values can then be used to derive a corrected distance modulus , according to the equation :    @xmath30 - 25\\ ] ]      in addition to peculiar velocity modifications , we also correct the _ wise _ photometry for the effects of dust extinction , due to both milky way reddening and internal absorption from the galaxies themselves .    to correct for galactic extinction , we apply the dust models of @xcite , obtaining reddening values for each galaxy from the nasa / irsa dust web service .",
    "since the web service only offers corrections for a limited number of wavebands , we adopt the reddening correction associated with the 3.6-micron irac-1 channel ( @xmath31 ) , as this wavelength is the closest to that of the 3.4 micron _ wise _",
    "w1 data we use . in general , extinction due to galactic reddening is small ( @xmath32 mag ) , however , the correction is still included for completeness sake .    we must also account for internal extinction by a galaxy s interstellar medium , an effect which increases with inclination angle . for this correction",
    ", we use the same technique described in @xcite : the modification takes the form of a broken power - law model with a shallow slope for low - to - moderate - inclination galaxies , and a steeper slope for high - inclination ( nearly edge - on ) galaxies .",
    "we specifically choose the broken power - law correction rather than a purely linear one ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to better match the redder near - ir colors of high - inclination ( @xmath33 galaxies @xcite . to correct the _",
    "wise _ galaxy sample , we start with the 2mtf k - band model from @xcite , but we scale both slopes to the w1 band by a 1/@xmath34 scaling law . this serves to flatten both the low - end and high - end slopes by nearly a factor of two ( @xmath35m/@xmath36 m ) , but this is expected , as dust absorption ( both internal and external ) is much less prevalent as wavelength increases .",
    "like the galactic extinction mentioned above , internal extinction corrections are also usually small ( @xmath37 mag ) , though some of the steeply inclined galaxies on our sample ( inclination @xmath38 ) can show as much as a 0.2 mag difference .      after calculating all of the luminosity corrections ,",
    "we apply them to the observed magnitudes , according to the equation :    @xmath39    these corrected magnitudes are then used in the tf relation .      like the luminosity",
    ", rotation widths must also be corrected before a tf relation can be fit . in particular , we must account for systematic effects between different telescopes , line width broadening due to cosmology , turbulent motion in the disks of galaxies , and inclination of the galaxies themselves .",
    "we now briefly describe these corrections .      since our line width data is taken from publicly available archives ,",
    "many galaxies ( especially those found in the cornell archive ) have already been corrected for both instrumental and cosmological effects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if these corrections are not already available , we calculate them ourselves using other methods , according to the equation    @xmath40    where @xmath41 represents the systematic instrumental correction , and the @xmath42 term corrects for cosmological broadening .      based on the turbulent motion simulations presented in @xcite , we apply a constant correction of @xmath43 km s@xmath9 to account for potential turbulent motion broadening .",
    "this shifts the entire tf relation to slightly lower line widths , decreasing the intercept of the fit by a small amount .      in order to further normalize our line width data",
    ", we also apply a correction for galaxy inclination .",
    "this is done using the standard @xmath44 broadening correction , where the inclination angle @xmath45 is again calculated from the galaxy s optical axis ratio .",
    "just as before , we apply all of the above corrections to the measured line widths for the tf analysis , according to the following equation :    @xmath46        after applying the corrections to galaxy magnitudes and line widths , we are able to create a tf relation with the data",
    ". a first look at this relation is shown in figure [ fig : tf_initial ] .",
    "like tf relations in other bands , the _ wise _ tf relation shows a positive correlation between galaxy magnitude and line width , with an average dispersion that increases towards the faint end . to better quantify this behavior",
    ", we fit a line to the data , using a levenberg - marquardt least squares optimization routine to determine the best - fit slope and intercept parameters .",
    "the minimization itself is applied to the bivariate @xmath47 function given by :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the model slope and offset , respectively , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the line widths and magnitudes of the sample galaxies , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the uncertainties on the measured data .",
    "these uncertainties are calculated by adding the intrinsic measurement uncertainties of the data in quadrature with the errors propagated from the corrections applied in the previous section .    to prevent outliers from biasing the results , we repeat the fitting process several times , applying a 3.5@xmath6 sigma clip to the data after each iteration . if after a particular iteration no galaxies are clipped from the sample ( typically after the 3rd or 4th fit ) , we consider the fit to have converged and treat the final parameters as our best - fit tf slope and intercept",
    ". examples of the fit can be seen in figure [ fig : tf_fits ] .    for the initial _",
    "wise _ tf relation , we find a best - fit slope of @xmath55 and a best - fit intercept of @xmath56 .",
    "to characterize uncertainties on the parameters , we analyze 1000 bootstrap resamplings of the data , measuring an average variation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the slope and intercept , respectively .    as a check on these parameters , we also fit the data with an inverse tf relation ( assuming @xmath51 as the dependent variable ) , given by @xmath59 like before , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the best fit slope and intercept , respectively . to obtain the best fit",
    ", we use a modified @xmath47 function : @xmath62 but maintain the 3.5@xmath6 clip .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters remain unchanged with this optimization scheme ( i.e. , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , and thus we focus only on the bivariate relation in the remaining analysis .      after initially constructing _ wise _ tf ( figure [ fig : tf_initial ] ) we notice a broken power - law feature in the data , occurring at @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both found slight morphological dependencies on tf parameters , with @xcite showing that earlier type spirals ( s0 through sb ) have a slightly brighter tf intercept , and @xcite finding that these spirals have both brighter intercepts and intrinsically shallower slopes .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that this morphological dependence may ( at least partially ) explain the break that we see . to investigate this",
    ", we separate our galaxy sample ( including those galaxies rejected by the sigma - clip ) into three distinct morphological categories : an s0/sa group , an sb group , and an sc / sd group , and fit a separate tf relation to each set .",
    "these fits can be seen in figure [ fig : morph_subgroup ] , and as expected , the s0/sa and sb galaxy samples do indeed have a shallower slope than the sc / sd subsample .",
    "in particular , we find slopes of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "these slope discrepancies are larger than those measured by @xcite in the optical , but are comparable to the near - ir slope discrepancies seen in the 2mtf templates @xcite . furthermore , since each group occupies a distinct region of tf phase space , with the s0/sa and sb groups laying mainly above @xmath65 and the sc / sd group positioned mainly below @xmath65 , the morphology dependence does appear to explain why the broken power - law feature is so distinct in figure [ fig : tf_initial ] .",
    "following @xcite , we apply an additional magnitude correction to s0/sa and sb galaxies , in order to normalize the data into a single sc / sd - equivalent tf relation . by doing this",
    ", we further reduce the dispersion on the _ wise _ tf relation , and can more easily compare it to the 2mtf templates , which are normalized to sc .",
    "we first fit new tf relations to the s0/sa and sb galaxy samples , but force the slopes to match the sc / sd sample slope .",
    "differences between the sc /",
    "sd tf intercept and the new , fixed tf relation intercepts ( @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ) are then added to the magnitudes of a given morphological type . to correct the `` tilt '' of the earlier - type spirals",
    ", we also include a line - width - dependent magnitude correction , given generally by @xmath71 $ ] , where @xmath72 is the difference between the s0/sa or sb slopes and the sc / sd slope presented above .      with all galaxies normalized to an sc template , we fit a new tf relation to the entire _ wise _ tf galaxy sample ( figure [ fig : tf_normalized ] ) , using the same bivariate fitting and sigma - clipping procedure outlined previously .",
    "the normalized relation shows a steeper overall slope ( @xmath76 ) and fainter intercept ( @xmath77 ) when compared to the unnormalized galaxy sample .",
    "we take these values to be our final , best - fit parameters , and use them to create a master _ wise _ tf relation :    @xmath78\\ ] ]    the data used to construct this final relation , including the observed galaxy magnitudes and line widths , the corrections applied to the observed quantities , and final data sigma - clipping can be seen in table [ tbl : tf_data ] .    to measure the total dispersion for the master _ wise _ tf , we calculate the weighted standard deviation around its fitted slope .",
    "we employ an inverse variance weighting scheme , taking the total variance for a given galaxy to be the quadrature sum of the uncertainties in line width and magnitude . for our data ,",
    "we find a total dispersion of @xmath3 magnitudes .",
    "from figure [ fig : tf_normalized ] , it is clear that the mid - ir tf relation does not maintain the near - zero scatter presented in figure 7d of @xcite , though this is not entirely surprising . since the sample used in @xcite is quite small ( consisting of only 8 galaxies )",
    ", it is possible that small - number statistics and chance alignment conspire to create the unusual result  a fact that freedman & madore themselves point out . by including a much larger sample of galaxies , as we have",
    ", one can gain a more complete picture of mid - ir tf magnitudes , leading to the larger dispersion estimates we see in our sample .",
    "in fact , over - plotting the @xcite sample on to the _ wise _ tf relation ( after adjusting the sample s zeropoint ) , we find that they are perfectly consistent with many of our own galaxies ( figure [ fig : wtf_vs_fm ] ) .",
    "the @xcite mid - ir tf relation provides a better point of comparison for _ wise _ tf . also using _ spitzer",
    "_ 3.6 @xmath0 m photometry , @xcite construct a tf relation using @xmath79200 galaxies found in large clusters . while the photometric corrections they apply to their galaxies are slightly different from our own ( they include small corrections for doppler shifting and psf diffusion , and do not include corrections for peculiar velocity or morphology ) , and the analysis technique is not the same ( in particular they only consider errors on line widths , rather than the bivariate fitting scheme we employ ) , we find that the final tf parameters agree well with _ wise _ tf : @xmath80 $ ] , where the 3.6 @xmath0 m zeropoint has been corrected from ab to vega magnitudes .",
    "the total dispersion of this tf relation is @xmath81 mags , slightly lower that the value we find for _ wise _ tf , but still much closer than that presented in @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to this `` raw '' tf relation , @xcite apply an extra ( i - [ 3.6 ] ) color correction to their galaxies in order to reduce the total scatter , showing that redder galaxies tend to lie above their mean tf relation and bluer galaxies lie below ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "this does reduce the scatter ( @xmath82 mags ) but also results in a shallower slope ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we do not apply this correction to our sample , but doing so may reduce the overall dispersion by up to 10% , based on the reduction to the 3.6 @xmath0 m relation .",
    "since our galaxy data is drawn from the 2mtf catalog , it is also interesting to see how the _ wise _ tf relation compares to the 2mtf templates .",
    "a comparison between the normalized _ wise _ tf relation and the k - band 2mtf relation from @xcite is shown in figure [ fig : wise_vs_k ] .",
    "for all three important tf parameters , the two relations are remarkably similar :    1",
    ".   slope : ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) 2 .",
    "zeropoint : ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) 3 .",
    "total dispersion : ( @xmath3 mag , @xmath88 mag ) .",
    "this agreement can ( at least partially ) be explained by examining the @xmath89 colors of typical tf galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : kw_colors ] we show the color magnitude diagram for the galaxies in the final _ wise _ tf sample . while there are a few noticeable outliers , a large majority of objects fall within 0.5 magnitudes of @xmath90 . of these ,",
    "nearly all are also within 0.2 magnitudes , save for a slight blueward trend at @xmath91 . given this near - neutral color , which suggests that the @xmath92- and @xmath1-bands trace similar stellar populations , ( including the older , centrally - located bulge stars near the cores of galaxies ) , it is clear the features of tf relations constructed in these two bands should very nearly mimic each other .",
    "like the 2mtf relations , the total scatter of the _ wise _ tf relation appears to qualitatively decrease towards the bright end of the sample .",
    "therefore , in addition to calculating a dispersion for the full data set , we also measure dispersions for subsamples of the data , binned by line width . this result is shown in figure [ fig : dispersions ] .",
    "as expected , the _ wise _ tf dispersion ( represented by green points ) does indeed decrease as line width increases , with narrow - end galaxies showing an average dispersion of @xmath79 1 magnitude , and wide - end galaxies showing an average dispersion of @xmath79 0.5 magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : dispersions ] also presents the binned k - band dispersion ( red points ) . comparing the two data sets",
    ", we see that the k - band relation is systematically lower than the _ wise _ tf , but by @xmath93 0.1 magnitudes , which is within the level of statistical uncertainty .",
    "large galaxies like m31 , which can compose up to 5% of a tf sample , have a prominent bulge in the mid - ir , much more so than in the optical .",
    "assuming model a of @xcite , m31-like galaxies have a bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio given by l@xmath94(bulge)/l@xmath94(disk ) = ( 2.5/2.7 ) @xmath95 ( 4.4/7 ) = 0.58 in the @xmath96-band . if the bulge is a magnitude redder than the disk in @xmath97 , the corresponding bulge - to - disk ratio in the mid - ir will instead be l@xmath98(bulge)/l@xmath98(disk ) = 1.45 .",
    "this suggests that _ wise _ magnitudes of the largest galaxies tend to be bulge - dominated .",
    "in addition to the luminosity , the presence of a bulge also affects the dynamical parameter ( i.e. , line width ) in the tf relation ( @xcite ) . switching a bulge on and off in a large galaxy , then ,",
    "could perturb such a galaxy s position in the tf relation by as much as 0.1 dex .",
    "bulge variance in massive galaxies therefore contributes to the scatter in tully - fisher , and may be partially responsible for the measured dispersion in the _ wise _ tf relation .",
    "galaxies with an active nucleus ( agn ) can also add to the scatter of the tf relation , as the flux coming from the active core can often dwarf the stellar emission , leading to a mismatch between a galaxy s total magnitude and line width . since it is possible that up to 10% of all emission - line galaxies in the local universe host an agn @xcite , it is important to identify and eliminate these objects from potential tf samples . while there are a number of successful techniques capable of identifying and segregating agn from other galaxies , one particularly apropos method utilizes a combination of mid - ir colors @xcite .",
    "originally developed using the _ spitzer _ irac wavebands , the concept has recently been extended to include _ wise _ photometry , where it has been shown that a ( @xmath99 ) color selection is remarkably efficient at segregating agn from normal , star - forming galaxies  at least for objects with redshifts @xmath100 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have further included _ wise _ @xmath101- and @xmath102-band information to the detection efforts , allowing for an improved targeting of dust - obscured agn as well .    while all of these studies share the common goal of obtaining the largest , cleanest sample of agn , we seek to do the exact opposite  namely , determine the _ wise _ color parameter(s ) that will most efficiently _ eliminate _ agn while keeping as many normal , star forming galaxies as possible .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wise_colors ] , we plot several color - color diagrams of the _ wise _ tf sample .",
    "along with the final _ wise _ tf galaxies ( red points ) we additionally plot the full 2mtf candidate galaxy catalog ( blue circles ) , in order to see if there are any significant differences between `` good '' tf galaxies and those rejected according to other physical parameters .",
    "we also include a set of known low - redshift ( @xmath25 ) agn ( yellow stars ) , taken from the @xcite quasar ( qso ) catalog , in order to better see the differences between active and normal galaxies .    in ( @xmath103)/(@xmath104 ) color space ( left panel ) , we see ( like previous studies ) a clear separation between the qso and tf galaxies , with the qsos having a significantly redder ( @xmath103 ) color .",
    "intriguingly , the qso color space is also populated with several rejected tf galaxy candidates , suggesting that our applied data cuts ( section [ data ] ) can at least partially eliminate some agn contamination already . while no single cut parameter eliminates all of the galaxies above the qso line , the line - width quality , inclination - angle , and morphology cuts are responsible for removing @xmath79 80% of these objects .",
    "replacing the ( @xmath104 ) color with ( @xmath105 ) ( middle panel ) , we still see the prominent separation between the qsos and tf galaxies , but the overall agn locus is much more pronounced , thanks to the reduced spread of the ( @xmath105 ) color . in many ways",
    "the `` best '' dividing line between qsos and normal galaxies is much easier to identify in this color space , and it may well be that , in the very local universe , the ( @xmath103)/(@xmath105 ) parameter is an even more efficient agn / tf discriminator .",
    "for the 2mtf catalog , cutting galaxies with ( @xmath103 ) @xmath106 should cleanly remove bright agn without significantly impacting the galaxy sample . finally , to highlight the importance of the ( @xmath103 ) color , we also plot objects in ( @xmath104)/(@xmath105 ) color space ( right panel ) . unlike previous color spaces",
    ", this space does not significantly differentiate between agn and normal galaxies , severely limiting its usefulness as a tf galaxy discriminator .",
    "we have presented a mid - infrared extension of the tully - fisher relation , using luminosities obtained from the _ wise _ satellite . the galaxies used in this work",
    "are taken from the all - sky , near - infrared 2mtf galaxy catalog and cover distances out to redshift @xmath107 .",
    "prior to constructing the full tf relation , we apply a number of corrections to both the magnitudes and line widths of these galaxies , in order to reduce the observed tf scatter and better compare our results to previous work .",
    "in particular we pay special attention to correcting the effects of peculiar velocities , using the model of @xcite , and we also apply a morphology correction in order to normalize magnitudes to an sc - type template .    after applying the corrections , we use a bivariate , least squares fitting routine to generate the best - fit tf parameters , finding a slope of @xmath76 and an intercept of @xmath108 .",
    "transforming the line widths into a magnitude measurement leads to the final _ wise _ tf relation , given by : @xmath109\\ ] ] we calculate the dispersion around the best fit model , measuring an average _ wise _ tf scatter of @xmath3 .",
    "however , we find that the overall scatter is strongly dependent on line width , with galaxies near @xmath110 having a dispersion approximately 0.5 mags greater than galaxies near @xmath111 .",
    "we find that the _ wise _ tf relation is significantly different from the preliminary 3.6 @xmath0 m _ spitzer _ tf relation presented in @xcite , with _ wise _",
    "tf having both a steeper slope and larger scatter .",
    "this is not surprising , however , given the small sample size and unusually bright galaxies chosen in that work .",
    "conversely , we find good agreement between _ wise _ tf and the cluster - based mid - ir tf relation presented in @xcite . given these similarities , in spite of somewhat different analytical techniques ,",
    "we conclude that a steeper , more scattered tf relation better describes the properties of galaxies observed in the mid - ir than the optimistic results of @xcite .",
    "finally , we also compare _ wise _ tf to the near - ir ( @xmath92-band ) 2mtf template relation presented in @xcite , and find that , both in terms of tf parameters and in total dispersion , the two relations agree extremely well , with both showing a tf slope near the theoretical limit of @xmath112 predicted from physical arguments",
    ". this result may not be entirely surprising , given that the typical @xmath89 color of _ wise _ tf galaxies is @xmath79 0 , and it suggests that the @xmath92-band and @xmath1-bands are tracing similar stellar populations ( including the older , centrally - located stars in the bulge ) .",
    "whether this agreement holds for tf relations constructed at longer wavelengths  where the observed light from thermally - heated dust will ostensibly begin to trace the younger , disk - dominated stars again  is unknown , but would be an interesting question to examine in future work .    the authors wish to thank the anonymous referee for thoroughly reading this manuscript and for providing several helpful comments and suggestions that greatly improved the work .",
    "we also thank pirin erdodu for providing the initial peculiar velocity model .",

    "while the interpolation procedure we use to smooth the @xcite peculiar velocity model allows us to select a more diverse range of peculiar velocities , these values may not always be correct , especially if the real velocity field varies in an unexpected way between data points .",
    "inaccurate velocity corrections can cause problems in the analysis , fundamentally change the fitted tf parameters , or at the very least increase the overall tf dispersion , leading to a pessimistic assessment of _ wise _ magnitudes for tf purposes .",
    "therefore , to check the accuracy of our interpolation scheme we compare our model peculiar velocities to real data , using galaxies with known redshifts and ( redshift - independent ) distances .    to collect a sample of galaxies with known distances , we turn to the ned - d database , an online compilation of redshift - independent distance measurements taken from the literature . while the full ned - d catalog contains over 60000 measurements , we limit our selection to distances calculated from type - ia supernova data , and further limit this subsample to galaxies located less than 247.5 mpc away from the earth ( the limit of the @xcite model ) .",
    "this leaves us with a total of 2189 measurements for 373 unique galaxies .",
    "we calculate peculiar velocities from these data using the standard technique of combining the distance measurement ( @xmath113 ) with its assumed hubble constant ( @xmath114 , also provided from ned - d ) and redshift ( @xmath115 ) , according to : @xmath116 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , the total and hubble flow recessional velocities mentioned in section [ vpec ] .    for each observed peculiar velocity , we also generate a corresponding model value using our interpolation method .",
    "since we already know the distances to these objects ( and hence , their true position in model space ) , we do not need to iterate over the total velocity field like we did for the galaxies in the main tf sample ( section [ vpec ] ) to measure a model peculiar velocity . instead",
    ", the peculiar velocity can be measured directly , using an object s supergalactic coordinates and observed distance : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is simply the @xcite model without a hubble flow component .",
    "the comparison between observed and model peculiar velocity values is presented in figure [ fig : vpec_comp ] .",
    "the left panel of the figure shows all galaxies taken from the ned - d catalog , while the right panel shows only those galaxies which have at least 10 independent distance measurements . in both panels ( for the sake of clarity )",
    "we average all measurements of a given galaxy into a single data point , using error bars to represent the dispersion of both quantities .",
    "overall , a meaningful description of the differences between the observed and model peculiar velocities is difficult , especially given that the error bars on the observed velocities are large .",
    "while the full galaxy sample shows a mild positive correlation between the two quantities ( @xmath119 ) , there is still a significant dispersion around the 1:1 correspondence line ( @xmath120 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "however , the correlation increases ( @xmath121 ) and the dispersion decreases ( @xmath122 km s@xmath9 ) when focusing only on the galaxies with 10 or more distance measurements , suggesting that , at least in cases where the distance to a galaxy is well constrained , there is not as significant a disagreement between observation and our model .    given the moderate success in recreating observed peculiar velocities , then , we believe that our interpolated peculiar velocity model will not statistically bias the magnitudes of our galaxy sample , and can thus be safely used to construct the _ wise _ tf relation .",
    "to observe the effects of peculiar velocity on the tf relation , we rerun the analysis without applying the interpolated model , then compare the parameters of this new tf model to the original .",
    "this is done after applying the initial magnitude and line width corrections ( section [ initial_tf ] ) , but _ before _ applying the morphology correction ( section [ morphology ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : vpec_results ] shows the results of this comparison , both in terms of the fit parameters ( left panel ) and total dispersion ( right panel ) .",
    "overall , we find that the peculiar velocity correction does not significantly alter the final results .",
    "while the slope of the uncorrected relation is nominally shallower ( @xmath123 ) , the intercept is brighter ( @xmath124 ) and the dispersion measurements differ ( the corrected relation shows slightly lower dispersions at the narrow line width end and slightly higher dispersions at the wide end ) , all of these changes are well within the current limits of statistical uncertainty .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected , given that on average a peculiar velocity correction alters galaxy magnitudes by less than 0.2 magnitudes , while the measured dispersion of the overall _ wise _ tf relation ranges between 0.5 and 1.5 magnitudes ( figure [ fig : dispersions ] ) .",
    "this suggests that peculiar velocities do not contribute significantly to the dispersion budget of the tf relation ( at least when dealing with mid - ir magnitudes ) , and that the scatter is instead driven by some other , unidentified parameter .",
    "however , even though the total effect is small , we still choose to include the peculiar velocity correction in our analysis , for the sake of completeness .",
