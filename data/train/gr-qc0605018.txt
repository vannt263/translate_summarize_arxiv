    "the coalescence of compact binaries are among the most important sources of gravitational waves to be detected by ground - based laser interferometers like ligo , tama , geo , and virgo .",
    "these observational efforts have served as the primary motivation to simulate compact binary systems .",
    "the simulations will provide crucial information in support of the data analysis .",
    "most of the focus has been on the simulation of black hole ( bh ) binaries and neutron star ( ns ) binaries , leaving aside the bh - ns binary system ( see  @xcite for recent progress ) . from the point of view of numerical relativity , the system bh - ns exhibits a dual challenge .",
    "it has the difficulties of evolving the geometry in the vicinity of bhs together with the difficulties inherent to magneto - hydrodynamical calculations .    from an astrophysical point of view",
    ", ns - bh binaries have the added interest of their potential relevance to gamma ray bursts .",
    "observations of short gamma ray bursts ( see  @xcite and more recently  @xcite ) suggest that the coalescence of ns binaries and/or bh - ns binaries are the underlying mechanism in the central engine for those bursts that last about @xmath0 .",
    "due to the high computational cost of simulations of bh - ns binary systems ( and the high cost of developing the appropriate computational infrastructure ) it is desirable to have a framework in which to study certain dynamical regimes of this system , relevant to gravitational - wave physics , that admit the use of approximations and thus facilitates a drastic reduction of the computational resources required . in this sense",
    ", we are particularly interested in the stages of the evolution where the predictions of post - newtonian methods become unreliable and where numerical relativistic simulations should take over .",
    "the _ hydro - without - hydro _ approximation that we propose in this paper aims at covering such part of the dynamical regime where the dynamical timescales related with deformations of the ns due to tidal effects are much bigger than the orbital timescales . in this regime",
    "we can freeze most of the hydrodynamical degrees of freedom and evolve a finite number of them by using appropriate approximations , focusing the attention on the radiation reaction effects in the orbit .",
    "it is this reduction of degrees of freedom which avoids the use of hydrodynamical computations .",
    "such an approach may also be relevant for extreme - mass - ratio binary systems whose dynamics are driven by radiation - reaction effects .",
    "the main goal of this paper is then to describe the setup for this type of simulations and test , by extending an existing code for bh evolutions , the basic ingredients of this framework .",
    "these ingredients can be summarized as follows :    [ [ spacetime - description ] ] spacetime description : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we use a full numerical relativity description of the spacetime based on the 3 + 1 bssn formulation ( baumgarte , shapiro  @xcite , and shibata , nakamura  @xcite ) of einstein s equations as implemented in the 3d numerical relativity code maya ( described in detail in  @xcite ) .",
    "the maya code is written by using the computational toolkit cactus  @xcite and the mesh refinement package carpet  @xcite .",
    "the key extension of this code regarding this project is the introduction of the matter source terms associated with the ns and the associated infrastructure to evolve the matter degrees of freedom .    [",

    "the tov model describes the equilibrium configuration of a stationary , relativistic star in spherical symmetry and thus represents a convenient description of the matter sources in the bh - ns system at hand .",
    "the superposition is carried out by using a procedure analogous to that used for the construction of binary bh initial data initial data in ks coordinates  @xcite .",
    "even though the resulting initial data do not satisfy the constraint equations exactly , the constraint violations are comparatively small because the individual bh and ns models do represent exact solutions of the einstein field equations . in this work",
    "we will investigate in detail the properties of these initial data from a physical and mathematical point of view .",
    "we will also discuss potential modifications of the data with regard to their repercussions on the physical content .",
    "finally we illustrate how adequate evolutions , even in the case of more extreme mass ratios , are facilitated by the modern infrastructure of numerical relativity .",

    "this is not necessary as the complete evolution of the matter sources is taken care of by the einstein field- and the energy - momentum conservation equations . in reducing the degrees of freedom in the way we are proposing , one",
    "is usually left with an approximation scheme in which the _ internal _ and _ external _ motions are cleanly separated , even though they are coupled in general .",
    "external _ motion consists in the motion of a reference point of the matter distribution , typically a relativistic generalization of the newtonian concept of center of mass , whereas the _ internal _ motion consists in the evolution of the parameters describing , for instance , the deformations of the matter distributions due to tidal deformations . as a consequence of reducing the number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "the description of the motion of the energy - momentum distribution in our setup consists of a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "the matter sources , as they appear in the evolution equations for the spacetime geometry are thus updated by merely substituting the values of the energy - momentum quantities after the motion of the matter has been determined . in this paper",
    ", we consider the simplest such description of the ns , namely that of a star _ rigidly _ moving along a prescribed trajectory . by using this simplification",
    "we ignore internal motions as well as radiation - reaction and finite size effects due to the _ external _ gravitational field .",
    "more specifically , the matter sources are prescribed by taking particular density and pressure profiles from a tov model which are going to be maintained along the evolution . the only way in which the sources change is through the _ rigid _ bulk motion of the center of the tov model along a fixed trajectory .",
    "the reason for considering such a simplified model is to perform a feasibility study of this method and thus lay the foundation for future studies of more realistic physical configurations of the bh - ns binary system . a similar approach to that proposed here has recently been used by bishop _",
    "@xcite in the framework of a characteristic formulation of the einstein equations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : theory ] we present the mathematical description of the different ingredients of our framework : spacetime geometry and dynamics ( [ spacetime ] ) , the descriptions of the bh and the ns ( [ bhdescription ] and  [ sec : tov ] respectively ) , the initial data for the bh - ns system ( [ initialdata ] ) , the dynamics of the ns ( [ nsmotion ] ) . in section  [ numericalframework ]",
    "we describe the computational framework and report on the results of numerical tests we have performed to analyze the initial data ( subsection  [ analysisinitialdata ] ) and to test time evolutions with matter sources ( [ timeevolutions ] ) .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of our findings .",
    "for the purpose of presenting the relativistic equations we set @xmath1 throughout this work .",
    "in this section we describe the different ingredients that constitute the mathematical framework that we are proposing for the numerical description in the time domain of bh - ns binary systems . for this purpose",
    "we need to consider both , the generation of initial data , and the evolution of these data . in the construction of initial data",
    "we closely follow a procedure used for a binary bh systems : the superposition of two bh solutions in ks form ( cf .",
    "this technique is based on the properties of the ks form of a single bh metric and its invariance under lorentz transformations of the coordinates .",
    "then , starting from two single bhs in ks coordinates ( and different coordinate origin ) a lorentz boost is applied to each of them and then , by identifying the coordinate systems , a superposed metric is constructed",
    ". this metric is no longer an exact solution of the einstein field equations ( the constraint are not satisfied ) , but it is an approximation which improves as the bh separation increases .",
    "this type of data has been shown to work well in numerical relativity simulations  ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it has the advantage that one can consider kerr bh initial data without the need to worry about spurious radiation that may originate in initial data constructions based on conformally - flat slicings .",
    "the evolution of the data is performed in analogy to that of bh - data , with one exception : the addition of matter source terms on the right hand side of the evolution equations .",
    "we thus obtain a fully non - linear evolution of the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "in contrast , we substantially reduce the degrees of freedom of the matter sources .",
    "we will discuss in detail in this section , how this enables us to obtain an approximate evolution of the matter data .",
    "we begin our description of the mathematical model with the spacetime geometry . in this work",
    "we follow the standard 3 + 1 splitting of einstein s equations based on the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formulation  @xcite ( see  @xcite for details ) . there",

    "we thus obtain @xmath20 where we have introduced the time derivative operator : @xmath21 because we are dealing with a physical system that contains matter , we also need to apply the 3 + 1 splitting to the energy - momentum tensor @xmath22 .",
    "this can be done by decomposing @xmath22 with respect to the unit normal @xmath23 : @xmath24 where the different quantities that appear in this expression are defined as follows : @xmath25 applying the 3 + 1 splitting to einstein s equations we obtain the _ evolution equations _ : @xmath26\\ , , \\label{dkdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the _ constraint equations _ :",

    "we are going to use a modification of this formulation due to shibata and nakamura  @xcite , and baumgarte and shapiro  @xcite , now known as the bssn 3 + 1 formulation of einstein s equations , which has been found to result in vastly improved stability properties in numerical simulations compared with the adm equations .",
    "the way in which the bssn formulation is introduced from the adm formulation is as follows : we introduce new variables based on a trace decomposition of the extrinsic curvature and a conformal rescaling of both the metric and the extrinsic curvature .",

    "the constraint violations inherent to this construction , however , are expected to be small . if , for example , one considers this type of superposed data as the background metric fields for the conformal transverse - traceless method of lichnerowicz , york and others  @xcite , the conformal factor obtained from solving the hamiltonian constraint is close to unity throughout the whole spacetime  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the quality of the data can always be enhanced by increasing the distance between the bhs .",
    "finally , this data is believed to avoid spurious radiation contamination , and in contrast to conformally - flat data , it is possible to introduce kerr bh solutions in a straightforward way .",
    "bonning _ et al _  @xcite have further shown that the superposed binary bh initial data lead to the correct ( newtonian ) binding energy in the newtonian limit .",
    "we can ask the same question about the prescription we have presented for bh - ns binaries . the answer is negative , and , in essence",
    ", the reason is that the way in which the ns has been introduced does not account for the deformations caused by the bh gravitational field . in the case of bh binaries",
    "the binding energy is defined as @xmath153 , where the total adm energy is @xmath154 and the individual energies are defined in terms of the apparent horizon masses : @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) . in the newtonian limit ( @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes the coordinate separation ) they are given by  @xcite : @xmath159 $ ] and @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "we thus get the familiar expression @xmath161 . if one of the objects is a ns , all that changes , is the individual energy @xmath162 associated with the star .",
    "it is now obtained from the integration of the ns energy density over the initial slice . including the contribution of the bh to the volume element , the result is @xmath163 , where @xmath164 denotes the ns self - binding energy .",
    "therefore , we do not recover the newtonian expression .",
    "the reason for this lies in the way in which the ns has been introduced in the superposition and the fact that the definition for its individual energy , @xmath162 , does not include the gravitational influence of the bh .",
    "it turns out that this way of superposing the ns is closer to the case of a test body . indeed ,",
    "if we look at the binding energy by considering the ns as a test body , we find that @xmath165 , i.e. the usual definition for test masses , and we obtain the correct newtonian expression .",
    "we could modify our description by performing an additional coordinate change to the ns model , prior to the superposition .",
    "this would result in extra parameters , which may be fixed so that the deformations of the ns produced by this coordinate change will account for the effects caused by the presence of the bh . while a detailed study of such modifications is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", it will be interesting to study their effect in future work .      in a completely general setup the equations of motion for the matter fields associated with the ns just follow from the local conservation of energy and momentum , i.e. @xmath166 which leads to the equations of magneto - hydrodynamics . in this paper ,",
    "however , we are advocating an approximate approach that avoids solving hydrodynamical equations by reducing the number of physical degrees of freedom to a finite number , the _ hydro without hydro _ approach .",
    "more precisely , the idea is , that we can approximate the matter description by a simplified model that involves a finite number of parameters , @xmath167 , so that the associated energy - momentum distribution is determined in terms only of these parameters and the trajectory of a certain _ center of mass _ , @xmath168 , that is , @xmath169\\,.$ ] then , in order to update the matter sources that enter in our bssn evolution equations we merely need to evolve the parameters @xmath167 ( referred to in this work as the _ internal _ motion ) and the components of the trajectory @xmath168 ( the _ external _ motion ) . in practice , evolution of these parameters",
    "is obtained from ordinary differential equations .",
    "this is a direct consequence of going from an infinite number degrees of freedom , as described by partial differential equations , to a finite number , described by ordinary differential equations .    for the case of extreme - mass - ratio binaries ,",
    "the structure of the small object may be neglected as a first approximation , so that we do not need to consider the interior motion . the external motion , in turn ,",
    "is given by the solution of the geodesic equations in the numerically constructed spacetime . in order to obtain a more realistic description of bh - ns binaries with similar masses",
    ", it is important to take into account the internal motion or , in other words , we need to allow for deformations of the ns associated with tidal forces arising from the presence of the bh . to that end ,",
    "an interesting approach is to consider the so - called affine stellar model introduced by lattimer and schramm  @xcite and further developed by carter and luminet  @xcite and generalized for curved spacetimes in  @xcite .",
    "as it stands now , however , the affine model is applicable only to slowly varying general relativistic spacetimes  @xcite , where a stationary background can be identified .",
    "this is an assumption that can not be adopted in our framework , since we are interested in situations that involve strong and dynamical gravitational fields .",
    "therefore , the affine model should be generalized appropriately for dynamical spacetimes . a particularly interesting way of doing this is based on dixon s work @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . the idea is to use the multipole moments associated with the energy - momentum tensor to construct equations of motion for the _ center of mass _ , i.e.@xmath168 , and for the extra parameters that describe the ns internal motion . in any case",
    ", the affine model has been used successfully to study the tidal interaction and disruption of stars by supermassive bhs  @xcite , isolated rotating stars  @xcite , stars in binary systems  @xcite and , more recently , gravitational signals arising from tidal interactions  @xcite .",
    "another semi - analytic approach is the ellipsoidal energy variational or roche - riemann model  @xcite and its relativistic generalization  @xcite which is formally equivalent to the hydrostatic limit of the affine model .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to investigate the stability of the numerical relativistic evolutions under the presence of moving matter distributions . to that end",
    ", we adopt the simplest possible evolution for the ns , namely a fixed trajectory around the bh .",
    "the numerical results presented in this work have been obtained with the 3d numerical relativity maya code which has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the code uses the cactus computational toolkit  @xcite for parallelization , data input / output and horizon finding .",
    "inside the cactus environment mesh refinement is provided by the carpet package  @xcite . with regard to earlier versions of the maya code used for bh simulations ,",
    "the evolution of extreme - mass - ratio binaries in the framework of the geodesic approximation method has made necessary some additions and modifications to the code .",
    "foremost , these are the implementation of dynamic ( moving ) mesh - refinement and the addition of the matter source terms on the right hand sides of the einstein field equations .",
    "both will be described in more detail as we discuss the numerical simulations performed in this work .",
    "we first address the calculation of the tov profiles .",
    "the tov equations  ( [ toveq1])-([toveq3 ] ) constitute a boundary value problem for the variables @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "this system of equations is closed by an equation of state @xmath173 , chosen to be of polytropic type in this work .",
    "the boundary conditions are given by @xmath174 at the center as well as @xmath175 and @xmath176 at the stellar surface .",
    "we solve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations using a standard relaxation scheme  @xcite . in practice",
    ", we calculate the tov profiles during the initialization phase of the code and store them as functions of the radial variable @xmath177 .",
    "the values required on the three - dimensional cartesian grid are then obtained from third order polynomial interpolation .",
    "the discretization of the bssn evolution equations  ( [ dtgdt]-[dtgdt ] ) has been implemented using centered second order stencils for spatial derivatives , except for the advection terms of type @xmath178 , for which second order accurate upwinding operators have been used .",
    "the integration in time is done using an iterative crank - nicholson scheme . as in simulations of vacuum spacetimes",
    "we have treated the spacetime singularities associated with the bhs by excising an area of finite size inside the apparent horizons ( see  @xcite for the details of the implementation of this technique ) .      in order to study the properties of the initial data proposed in this paper we have considered six different tov models for the ns .",
    "the physical features of these models ( the polytropic coefficient @xmath79 , the polytropic index @xmath80 , stellar radius @xmath95 and mass @xmath179 , compactness ratio @xmath180 , and central density @xmath181 ) are shown in table  [ tab : stellar_models ] .",
    "notice , that the compactness ratios are small and hence some of the models would describe stars much less compact than astrophysical nss .",
    ".[tab : stellar_models ] parameters and resulting mass and density for the six stellar models discussed in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the convergence analysis we have calculated the data for two different grid spacings @xmath182 and @xmath183 as listed in the table . because an isolated boosted tov star is a solution of the einstein equations we expect the hamiltonian and momentum constraints , given by equations  ( [ hconstraint],[pconstraint ] ) , to converge to zero at second order .",
    "numerically this implies that the constraint violations obtained for the high resolution calculation should be @xmath184 smaller than those obtained at coarse resolution .    figure  [ fig : close_r0.1_m0.01_hamx_momxx ] demonstrates second order convergence for the hamiltonian and the norm @xmath185 of the momentum constraints along the @xmath186-axis , obtained for the most compact model of table [ tab : stellar_models ] , model 4 .",
    "we find similar results for all constraint functions on arbitrary axes .",
    "a similar analysis at coarser resolution ( @xmath187 instead of @xmath188 ) , however , gave less satisfactory results , indicating that the resolutions used here are necessary for model 4 .",
    "for the other , less extreme , models we find correspondingly less strict requirements on the resolution to achieve second order convergence .",
    "we now turn our attention to the binary data obtained for non - vanishing mass of the bh . in the continuum limit",
    "the resulting data are a solution of the einstein equations only as the separation of the two objects becomes infinite .",
    "we therefore do not expect the constraint violations to converge to zero . on the other hand",
    ", the constraints will never be satisfied exactly in a numerical simulation because of the finite numerical accuracy . in order to assess the significance of the constraint violations inherent to the superposed data relative to the limitations in numerical accuracy we follow the same approach as in  @xcite and study the constraint violations at different resolutions .",
    "if the constraint violations decrease at about second order for higher resolutions we conclude the inherent constraint violations ( due to the fact that we are not solving them ) to be insignificant relative to the purely numerical error .    for this purpose",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : constraints_bh ] the convergence of the hamiltonian constraint and the norm @xmath189 of the momentum constraints along the @xmath186-axis . for clarity we have used a logarithmic scale for the distance from the origin in both directions . as in the case of an isolated star , we find that the constraints converge away at second order for the resolutions used here .",
    "the only exception is the region of the star , where the non - linear interaction between the gravitational fields of the two objects is strongest and we expect the constraint violations inherent to this data construction to be largest .",
    "it is these constraint violations which represent the approximative nature of our approach to study this type of binary configurations .",
    "figure  [ fig : constraints_bh ] also illustrates the high computational demands for simulations of more compact objects .",
    "the two models ( 3 and 4 of table [ tab : stellar_models ] used in the figure represent the least and most compact stars . clearly the constraint violations found for model @xmath190 in the upper two panels are very large compared to the average violations near the bh .",
    "this is an artifact of the high densities and curvature encountered near the small star in combination with resolutions currently available with our computers . in contrast the constraint violations found for model @xmath191 in the lower panels is substantially smaller than those observed near the bh .",
    "we emphasize that this issue is separate from the convergence properties mentioned above .",
    "in fact , the convergence properties found for model 4 are closer to second order than those found for model @xmath191 .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the constraint violations near the very compact object @xmath190 are dominated by the discretization errors arising from the insufficient resolution near the stellar center . for these reasons we study in the next subsection evolutions of the less compact model @xmath191 only , for which we are confident to achieve sufficient resolution , even inside the star .      in this section we present time evolutions of the initial data presented above .",
    "following our previous discussions , we focus on the implementation of the different elements of this type of simulations in the framework of moving refinement components with emphasis on the stability of the evolutions .    to this end , we have evolved the superposed data of a bh of mass @xmath192 and stellar model @xmath191 as listed in table [ tab : stellar_models ] .",
    "because of memory restrictions of the available computational resources we have evolved this binary system using a distance @xmath193 and a grid setup slightly different from that of table [ tab : reflevels ] . the grid specifications used in the evolution are listed in table [ tab : reflevels_evol ] . of the refinement levels listed there , number @xmath43 to @xmath194 remain fixed throughout the evolution .",
    "level @xmath195 , however , is required to follow the motion of the stellar object and thus needs to move .",
    "for this purpose we use the _ regridding _ operation implemented inside carpet .",
    "this operation allows for interpolation of function values from coarser onto finer refinement levels .",
    "this operation is regularly performed in mesh refinement simulations of berger - oliger type to provide boundary conditions for the inner levels , the so - called _",
    "prolongation_. in case of a moving high resolution grid component , the same operation is used to fill the new points on that component with valid data from the coarser levels . inside the maya code",
    "we use this feature by adjusting the specifications , i.e.@xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , of refinement level @xmath195 in the course of the evolution .    c|c|cccc refinement level & @xmath200 $ ] & @xmath201 $ ] & @xmath202 $ ] & @xmath203 $ ] & @xmath204 $ ] +   + 1 & @xmath205 & @xmath206 & @xmath207 & @xmath206 & @xmath207 + 2 & @xmath208 & @xmath209 & @xmath210 & @xmath209 & @xmath210 + 3 & @xmath211 & @xmath212 & @xmath213 & @xmath212 & @xmath213 + 4 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 & @xmath215 & @xmath216 + 5 & @xmath217 & @xmath218 & @xmath219 & @xmath218 & @xmath219 + 6 & @xmath220 & @xmath221 & @xmath222 & @xmath223 & @xmath208 +    we have implemented two alternative ways of controlling these values .",
    "the first uses the tracking of the bh singularity , as provided , for example , by an apparent horizon finder , and moves the center of the refinement component by a corresponding amount . because this method is inherently restricted to bhs , we also allow for the center of the component to follow a user specified trajectory .",
    "this second method is realized for the case of the stellar object discussed in this work .",
    "the    trajectory is the same as that used for the motion of the stellar object itself . in fig.[fig",
    ": evolution ] we show four snapshots of the ensuing evolution .",
    "the figure shows the trace of the extrinsic curvature obtained at times @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "while the bh is represented by the large central throat , the stellar object manifests itself in the form of the small perturbation initially visible to the right of the bh ( upper left panel ) .",
    "the simulations we have carried out last at least for an evolution time of @xmath228 , corresponding to about one and a half orbits , without showing signs of instability . furthermore , no elaborate fine - tuning of the parameters was necessary to achieve evolutions . in conclusion ,",
    "simulations on orbital timescales appear to be achievable rather straightforwardly using the approach discussed in this work .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a framework to study bh - ns binaries using a fully non - linear evolution of the spacetime geometry and an approximate evolution of the ns matter sources based on the reduction of the degrees of freedom of the ns , so that hydrodynamical calculations are avoided .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom , including the motion of the ns are governed by odes .",
    "we expect this framework to be useful to investigate certain dynamical regimes of the bh - ns binary system relevant for the point of view of gravitational - wave astronomy .",
    "the construction of the initial data is performed by generalizing the superposition technique of @xcite , as applied to bh binaries in ks form , to bh - ns binaries in ks - like coordinates . in order to make this approach functional in numerical relativity using three - dimensional",
    "cartesian coordinates , we found it necessary to modify the standard coordinate transformation to ks coordinates inside the ns .",
    "in particular , we used a coordinate transformation that avoids the appearance of a coordinate singularity at the stellar centre , while preserving the light - like geodesic structure of the coordinates outside the star .",
    "we have studied the properties of the initial data thus obtained for a set of stellar models with different values of the compactness and mass ratios .",
    "an adequate description of extreme - mass - ratio binaries involving compact stars is only made possible by the use of advanced mesh - refinement techniques .",
    "we have demonstrated second - order convergence of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints in the case of an isolated ns ( corresponding to an infinite bh - ns separation ) . for finite separations we still observe second - order convergence of the constraints over large parts of the computational domain .",
    "we thus conclude that these initial data sets are as suitable for the description of bh - ns binaries as the pure bh - bh analog previously discussed in the literature .",
    "finally , we have investigated the feasibility of evolving such scenarios in time using modern methods of numerical relativity . in the numerical simulations considered in this work for testing purposes ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the simple case in which the ns follows a prescribed trajectory .",
    "foremost , our interest was focused on the stability of the resulting simulations and the demands on computational resources .",
    "we have found that for sufficiently extreme mass ratios , long - term stable simulations on orbital time scales can be achieved straightforwardly using standard evolution schemes for solving the einstein field equations .",
    "as the equal - mass limit is approached , the stability properties deteriorate because of the strong dynamics in the vicinity of the bh . in this limit",
    ", our approach no longer provides an adequate description of the matter sources , however .",
    "the scenarios of immediate interest for our approximation technique are thus within the range of capability of our evolution code .    with regard to the compactness of the ns we find that the combination of extreme mass ratios with high compactness of the ns result in very steep gradients .",
    "these , in turn , demand a very high resolution and a large number of refinement levels .",
    "currently we do not have the computational resources available to provide such resolution in long - term evolutions .",
    "we have therefore studied the time evolutions of less compact objects , but still orders of magnitude more compact than what has hitherto been considered using this type of approach . such studies are well within the scope of current resources and can be refined in the future , by adding radiation - reaction effects to the dynamics and/or internal degrees of freedom of the ns to study different aspects of these systems in the context of gravitational - wave astronomy .",
