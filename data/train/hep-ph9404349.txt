    "su(5 ) supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) is an attractive candidate for the unified theory of strong and electroweak interactions .",

    "one of the features of mssm / susy - gut is the existence of soft susy breaking .",
    "it gives quarks ( or leptons ) and their superpartners different mass matrices in the generation ( flavor ) space . in results , due to the discrepancy between the mass diagonalizing bases of quarks and those of squarks ,",
    "a generation mixing occurs in the quark - squark - gaugino coupling ( gluino coupling , in particular ) , which may give considerable contributions to the nucleon decay , flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and other various phenomena in susy - gut .",
    "the flavor mixing in the gaugino coupling plays an important role in the nucleon decay , since its amplitude is dominated by the dimension five interaction followed by the gaugino `` dressing '' process @xcite in the minimal su(5 ) susy - gut model .",
    "however , only a simplified treatment is made in the previous analyses of the nucleon decay @xcite , where the diagonal ( in the generation space ) gluino coupling is assumed leading to the negligible contribution from the gluino dressing process .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the flavor mixing in the gaugino coupling extensively and evaluate the contribution of the gluino dressing process to the nucleon decay amplitude .",
    "based on the minimal su(5 ) supergravity ( sugra- ) gut @xcite , we assume that the soft susy breaking parameters are `` universal '' at the gut scale @xcite . we include all off - diagonal elements of yukawa coupling matrices and of squark / slepton mass matrices in solving numerically one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) for all mssm parameters @xcite with the universal boundary conditions",
    "we then evaluate the effective potential for the higgs fields at the electroweak scale to find a consistent su(2)@xmath2u(1 ) breaking minimum in accordance with the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario @xcite .",
    "the obtained mass matrices of all particles are diagonalized to evaluate the flavor mixing in the gaugino couplings .",
    "the mass spectrum and the mixing are then used to calculate the nucleon decay amplitudes for various decay modes .",
    "it is found that the flavor mixing in the gluino coupling depends on @xmath0 ( ratio of vacuum expectation values of the higgs doublets ) and is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding kobayashi - maskawa matrix element . as for the nucleon decay",
    ", we find the gluino dressing process dominates the amplitude for the decay modes containing a charged lepton ( and a meson ) if @xmath0 is large and if the gluino mass is much smaller than the squark masses . note that the flavor mixing in the gaugino couplings is studied previously in a systematic analysis of fcnc @xcite with a semi - analytic solution of the rges for small @xmath0 ( top yukawa coupling @xmath4 bottom yukawa coupling ) . on the contrary ,",
