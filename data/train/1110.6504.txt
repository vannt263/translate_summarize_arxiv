    "meson - nucleus systems are one of the most interesting laboratories to study the meson properties at finite density and to explore the symmetry breaking pattern of qcd and its partial restoration in nucleus  @xcite . especially , the studies of the bound states of meson and nucleus have the following advantages ; ( i ) the selective observation of the meson properties is possible by making use of the fixed quantum numbers of the bound states , ( ii ) the meson properties inside the nucleus can be observed clearly only with relatively small contamination from the vacuum processes , and ( iii ) the system is quasi - static and the time dependent dynamical evolution of the system is irrelevant .",

    "the one nucleon pick - up reactions are found to be useful for the mesic nucleus formation , however , they require the large momentum transfer for heavy meson production which is one of the main obstacle to observe bound states .",
    "thus , we think that we need to develop new methods for bound state formations to extend our studies to other meson - nucleus systems , especially for heavier mesons . actually , we are interested in the heavy meson - nucleus systems such as @xmath7 meson for the studies of @xmath8 anomaly effects  @xcite , @xmath9 meson for @xmath10 components of nucleon and ozi rule at finite density  @xcite , and @xmath11 mesons for the charm meson properties in nucleus  @xcite .",
    "thus , we would like to study the two nucleon pick - up reactions theoretically as a possible method suited to form the heavy meson nucleus bound systems .",
    "one of the most serious problems in the formation reactions of the heavy meson nucleus systems are the large momentum transfer as mentioned above .",
    "it is known that the matching condition of momentum and angular momentum transfers plays an important role to determine the largely populated subcomponents and it is also known that the best choice for our purpose is the total angular momentum transfer @xmath12 state formation in the recoilless kinematics in many cases . in the one nucleon pick - up reactions which we have mainly considered so far , the recoilless kinematics can not be satisfied for the formation of heavier meson bound states than the nucleon mass because of the large mass of the meson .",

    "<S> we develop a model to evaluate the formation rate of the heavy mesic nuclei in the two nucleon pick - up reactions , and apply it to the @xmath0li target cases for the formation of heavy meson@xmath1 bound states , as examples . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the quasi - deuteron in the target nucleus is assumed in this model . </S>",
