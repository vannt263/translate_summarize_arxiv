    "the approximation of the exact density of states of a quantum system in terms of classical periodic orbits via semiclassical trace formulae is a fascinating subject which has triggered a lot of research ( see @xcite and the literature quoted therein ) .",
    "it presents a nice illustration of the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics , besides allowing one to approximately determine quantum shell structures in terms of classical mechanics ( see @xcite for applications in various fields of physics ) . in hamiltonian systems which are classically neither regular nor purely chaotic ,",
    "this semiclassical theory is enriched  but also complicated  by the many facets of non - linear dynamics .",
    "one of them is the bifurcation of periodic orbits when they undergo changes of stability @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient to determine the stability of a periodic orbit is its so - called stability matrix @xmath4 , appearing in the amplitudes of gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite , which is determined from the linearized equations of motion around the periodic orbit .",
    "the analytical calculation of @xmath4 for non - integrable systems with mixed dynamics is in general not possible ; the only non - trivial example is , to our knowledge , that of a two - dimensional quartic oscillator @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the stability matrix @xmath4 of the simplest orbit in a class of two - dimensional potentials which are a generalization of the famous hnon - heiles ( hh ) potential @xcite that has become a text - book example of a system with mixed classical dynamics . for small energies",
    "the motion is dominated by a harmonic - oscillator part and is quasi - regular ; at energies close to and above the saddles ( @xmath0 ) , over which a particle can escape , the motion is quasi - chaotic ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the literature quoted therein ) . at all energies below the saddle , there exists a straight - line librating orbit a oscillating towards one of the saddles .",
    "this orbit undergoes an infinite sequence of stability oscillations and hence a cascade of bifurcations , which can be understood as the main mechanism of the transition from regular motion to chaos @xcite .",
    "the stability traces of the new orbits r and l generated at the bifurcations are found numerically @xcite to intersect linearly at the saddle energy ( @xmath0 ) , forming what was termed the `` hnon - heiles fans '' @xcite .    in the present paper we present analytical calculations of the stability traces of both the a orbit and the new orbits r and l bifurcating from it .",
    "the results are obtained in the limit close to the saddle ( @xmath5 ) and hence asymptotically valid as the bifurcation energies @xmath2 approach the saddle energy @xmath0 .",
    "they confirm analytically the numerical properties of the `` hnon - heiles fans '' also in the generalized hh potential . as a bonus ,",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for the bifurcation energies @xmath2 , which are mathematically valid asymptotically for @xmath6 , i.e. , for @xmath7 , and practically for @xmath8 within 5 digits .    in",

    "we present the basic ideas of our analytical approach and the essential results , while the technical details of our calculations are given in the appendices [ app1 ] and [ app2 ] . in we present an alternative perturbative approach for evaluating the stability traces , with the details given in appendix [ appc2 ] , and compare its results with those of the non - perturbative calculations .",
    "in this paper we investigate the following family of hamiltonians : h_ghh = 12(p_x^2+p_y^2)+12(x^2+y^2 ) + , [ ghh ] where @xmath9 is a parameter specifying specific members of the family , and @xmath10 is a chaoticity parameter that can be scaled away with the energy as shown below . for @xmath11 ,",

    "the c@xmath12 symmetry is lost and only the reflection symmetry at the @xmath21 axis remains ; there are , however , still three saddles over which the particle can escape . for @xmath22",

    "the scaled hamiltonian becomes independent of @xmath25 , and for a given @xmath26 there is only one parameter @xmath27 that regulates the classical dynamics . for simplicity of notation ,",

    ", the three saddles are at the scaled energy @xmath0 ; one of them is positioned at @xmath29 , @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the saddle with energy @xmath0 persists at the same position , while the two other saddles lie at different energies and are positioned symmetrically to the @xmath21 axis . for a more detailed description of the topology of the potential ( and an even larger class of generalized hh potentials ) and its shortest periodic orbits , we refer to a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "the shortest periodic orbits of the standard hh system ( @xmath11 ) have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , and their use in semiclassical trace formulae for the quantum density of state of the hh system was investigated in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , we use henceforth the symbols @xmath28 for the scaled coordinates ( corresponding to @xmath32 ) , along with the scaled energy @xmath27 given in .",
