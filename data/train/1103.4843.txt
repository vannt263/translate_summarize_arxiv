    "a concrete statement was formulated in  @xcite .",
    "it relates quantum deformed periods on the seiberg - witten spectral curve to the nekrasov prepotential with only one turned on .",
    "the conjecture has been tested extensively for the pure @xmath2 gauge theory in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "here we consider this theory with additional @xmath1 matter hypermultiplets in fundamental representation .",
    "some checks for @xmath3 theory with @xmath4 flavours were performed in  @xcite and  @xcite employing the baxter equation for the gaudin magnet as the quantum version of the spectral curve equation .",
    "here we perform a thorough set of checks for various @xmath5 and @xmath1 using instead the baxter equation for the xxx spin chain .",

    "additionally we show that the conjecture holds to _ all _ orders in @xmath6 for the perturbative part of the prepotential in the case of @xmath7 with up to four hypermultiplets .",
    "let us note that the equivalence of the gaudin systems and spin chains is not trivial even in the _ classical _ limit , so it is remarkable that the two systems do give the same _ quantum _ periods .",
    "our general claim is as follows .",
    "one starts with the equation for the seiberg - witten spectral curve , which in our case reads  @xcite k(p ) - 2 (k_+(p)e^ix + k_-(p)e^-ix)=0 , [ class ] where @xmath8 and k(p)=u_n _ j=1^n_c ( p - _ j)=_j=1^n_c u_j p^j ,    ccc k_+(p)= _ j=1^n_+ ( p + m_j ) , & k_-(p)= _ j = n_+ + 1^n_f ( p + m_j ) , & k_+(p ) k_-(p ) = _ j=1^n_f ( p + m_j ) = _ j=1^n_f",
    ".    the distribution of masses between  `` @xmath9 '' and  `` @xmath10 '' polynomials does not affect the periods of @xmath11 .",
    "the periods of the differential @xmath12 found using  ( [ class ] ) define the seiberg - witten prepotential  @xmath13  ( which we call the `` classical '' one ) : a_i & = & ^0_a_i(,m , ) = _ a_i pdx , [ classper1 ] + & = & ^0_b_i(,m , ) = _ b_i pdx .",
    "[ classper2 ] one obtains the `` quantum deformed '' prepotential by quantization of eq .",
    "( [ class ] ) .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ class ] ) is understood as the semiclassical limit of schrdinger - like equation ( which is in fact the fourier transform of the baxter equation for the xxx spin chain ) and @xmath14 is just the classical momentum  @xcite .",
    "the periods of @xmath12 are the same as the periods used in the bohr - sommerfeld quantization conditions in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "they are therefore subject to quantum corrections : the differential @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath15 .",
    "these _ exact quantum periods _ determine the deformed prepotential by the formulas similar to  ( [ classper1 ] ) ,  ( [ classper2 ] ) : a_i & = & ^_a_i(,m , ) = _ a_i pdx , + & = & ^_b_i(,m , ) = _ b_i pdx .",
    "the prepotential defined in this way turns out to coincide with the nekrasov function with only one @xmath16-parameter turned on ,  @xmath17 .    when one tries to quantize eq .",
    "( [ class ] )   that is write @xmath18 instead of @xmath11   one encounters the operator ordering problem .",
    "this is in fact a minor obstacle because different orderings are related by the shift in masses of the hypermultiplets : e^itx ( -i+ m_f ) e^i(1-t)x = ( -i+ m_f - t ) e^ix . having this in mind one writes out the baxter equation corresponding to eq .",

    "( [ equation ] ) ( or equivalently to choose what we call the mass of the hypermultiplet ) so as to make all the odd powers of @xmath6 in periods vanish .",
    "this was automatic in the pure @xmath2 case but requires fixing the particular ( symmetric ) ordering in our case .",
    "let us briefly recall the idea of perturbative checks analogous to  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is as follows :    * solve the quantum baxter equation perturbatively in @xmath6 to find several first @xmath22 .",

    "we remind the nekrasov functions relevant for our case . in section  [ pertchecks ] we perform the checks for lower orders in @xmath6 .",
    "this prescription is of use to check the conjecture to any desired order both in @xmath6 and @xmath25 , but the _ general _ order can not be approached in such a manner",
    ". however there exists a way to check the conjecture for 1-loop part of the nekrasov function to _ all _ orders in @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the 1-loop part of @xmath35 is dominant for small @xmath25 , when all the instanton corrections are suppressed .",
    "our objective is therefore to investigate the corresponding case @xmath36 in the quantum baxter equation  ( [ equation ] ) .",
    "there are no instanton corrections to @xmath37 , so @xmath38 in this regime .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 does not recieve @xmath6 corrections and therefore @xmath40 .",
    "this can be inferred from the following argument . in gauge theory",
    "the seiberg - wittem prepotential is defined up to addition of a function quadratic in @xmath41 , thus to the classical b - periods one can add a term linear in @xmath41 ( in zero instanton approximation just @xmath23 ) .",
    "as we have mentioned , periods of the nekrasov prepotential can be generated by acting on classical periods with certain differential operator @xmath28 .",
    "higher orders of @xmath42 in @xmath6 should not change if we consider @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 as a classical period .",
    "thus the differential @xmath28 does not change @xmath23 and hence the a - periods in the zero instanton approximation .    to find the b - periods one observes that @xmath45 can be rewritten as p(x ) = -i ( x ) , where ( x ) = ( ^x p(y)dy ) .",
    "the b - periods are thus rewritten using @xmath46 : ^_b_i(,m , ) = ( a ) - ( b ) , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 lie on different sides of the cut expansion of the periods . here",
    "we provide an exact result for  @xmath36 . ] . solving the baxter equation  ( [ equation ] ) in the limit",
    "@xmath36 one finds agreement with perturbative part of the nekrasov prepotential .",
    "we carry out this checks in the case of pure @xmath3 gauge theory with up to four hypermultiplets in section  [ exactcheck ] .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us remind that the exact momentum @xmath49 is understood as a perturbative series @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , one needs to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "for this task it is convenient to define the generating function @xmath51 substituting the expansion for @xmath49 into eq .",
    "( [ genfunc ] ) and expanding the exponent in terms of @xmath52 one obtains @xmath53 expanding @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 one gets @xmath56 and finally @xmath57 now having the expression  ( [ k(d ) ] ) we can proceed to solve eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) .",
    "one notices that the system of equations is `` triangular '' ( though nonlinear )   meaning that @xmath58 appears linearly in order @xmath59 and is expressed through the lower @xmath60 .",
    "thus for any given @xmath61 one can solve the equation iteratively .",
    "the first correction @xmath62 turns out to be total derivative : p_1=-12 ( k + v ) , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , this was exactly our aim when we chose operator ordering on eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) .",
    "the non - trivial correction appears only in the second order : @xmath66 the third order is again total derivative as required , though less simple : @xmath67 this conforms with our intention of eliminating all the odd orders of @xmath6 in the quantum periods .",
    "it is instructive to see that the classical periods @xmath68 do not depend on the particular partition of @xmath69 into the `` @xmath9 '' and `` @xmath10 '' groups . moving @xmath70 from one group to another",
    "is equivalent to shifting @xmath71 .",
    "then the change in @xmath68 is ^0 = p_0 dx p_0 dx - i = _0 - i . because the contours can be chosen not to encircle the @xmath72 point , the period is left unchanged .",
    "if analogously to  @xcite one considers a more general form of eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) with two different constants ( instead of single one   @xmath73 ) in front of the two exponents then the classical periods @xmath74 will depend only on the product of these constants .    having these two facts in mind one can consider only the case @xmath75 and thus replace @xmath76 by @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",

    "now we try out the `` asymmetric '' form of the baxter equation : ( -i_)^2 + ^2 + ",
    "( e^(_+ m_1 + ) (_+ m_2 + ) + e^- ) = 0 . [ su2 + 2b ]",
    "the solution in the @xmath129 region is the same as in the pure gauge theory : @xmath137 ; in the @xmath130 region eq .",
    "( [ su2 + 2b ] ) becomes ( -i)^2 _ + ^2 _ + e^ (+ m_1 + ) (+ m_2 + ) _ = 0 , with @xmath138 .",
    "the solution is chosen so as to be regular at the point @xmath139 : @xmath140 here @xmath141 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "the period determined by the asymptotics of the solutions @xmath142 , @xmath143 coincides with the one obtained in the `` symmetric '' form of the baxter equation .",
    "one also obtains the same result with yet another placement of the multiplets : ( -i_)^2 + ^2 +  ( e^+ e^- (_+ m_1 - ) (_+ m_2 - ) ) = 0 .",
    "the solutions are _ ( ) & = & f_2 ( , -m_1 , -m_2 ; - ) , + _ ( ) & = & f_0 ( , ) .",
    "thus the periods are the same in this case . summing up",
    ", we see that shuffling the hypermultiplets between the two terms of the baxter equation indeed does not affect the periods .      two of the three hypermultiplets must be placed in front of one of the exponents .",
    "otherwise the resulting equation will be higher than second order and therefore not tractable .",
    "following the same steps as in the previous subsections one gets the solutions and the period for this case : _ ( ) & = &  ( - ) f_1 ( , m_3 ; - ) , + _ ( ) & = & f_2 ( , m_1 , m_2 ; ) .",
    "_b^= - [  ( ) ^-  ( ) ^2 _ f=1 ^ 3 ] .",
    "for the case of four hypermultiplets instead of @xmath73 one has @xmath144 with @xmath145 being the microscopic coupling , well defined in this situation .",
    "otherwise this case is in complete analogy with the previous ones and the periods are found to be _b^= - [  ( ) ^-  ( ) ^2 _ f=1 ^ 4 ] .",
    "we have presented evidence that nekrasov prepotential for @xmath2 theory with hypermultiplets in fundamental representation arises when one considers the quantization of the corresponding seiberg - witten curve .",
    "we have checked this conjecture :    * for perturbative part of the prepotential for general @xmath5 and @xmath1 to the order @xmath146 . * for 1-instanton part for @xmath147 , @xmath98 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 to the order @xmath146 . * for perturbative part of the prepotential for @xmath97 and @xmath148 to all orders in @xmath6 .    what is important , these checks were exact in masses of the hypermultiplets .",
    "thus we have also checked that the baxter equation for the xxx spin chain and gaudin magnet give the same quantum deformed periods in the listed cases .",
    "this statement requires further investigation because for the gaudin system only lowest correction in  @xmath6 for the case of @xmath3 was obtained in  @xcite .",
