    "the feature of quantum mechanics which most distinguishes it from classical mechanics is the coherent superposition of distinct physical states , usually referred to as quantum coherence .",
    "it embraces also entanglement , i.e. non - local quantum correlations arising in composite systems @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence results rather fragile against environment effects and this fact has boosted the development of a quantum control theory @xcite . just like the classical one ,",
    "quantum control theory includes open - loop control and closed - loop control according to the principle of controllers design @xcite .",
    "feedback is a paradigm of closed loop control , in that it involves gathering information about the system state and then according to that actuate a corrective action on its dynamics .",
    "it has been shown that quantum feedback is superior to open - loop control in dealing with uncertainties in initial states @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proven that it works better than open - loop control when it aims at restoring quantum coherence @xcite .    in the presence of feedback",
    ", suitable quantum operations are added to the bare dynamical map ( resulting from the environment action ) of a quantum system .",
    "these quantum operations should be determined according to the desired target state .",
    "this is like to say that one optimizes the _",
    "actuation_. besides , it is known that there is a correspondence between measurement on the environment and the representation of the map @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is clear that one has to optimize the _",
    "measurement _ overall possible representations of the map in order to to extract the maximum information with the minimum disturbance .",
    "altogether , it can be said that feedback implies in the quantum realm a double optimization , over the measurement and over the actuation process @xcite .",
    "this makes designing the optimal feedback control a daunting task for quantum systems , especially composite ones and hence entanglement control ( we refer here to _ local _",
    "control , i.e. measurement and actuation are both local operations ) . in linear bosonic systems",
    "the pursued strategy was to steer a system towards a stationary state entangled as much as possible @xcite . dealing with the inherent nonlinearity of qubits",
    "makes this strategy very challenging and no progresses have been made since the seminal work of ref.@xcite .",
    "hence , we shall consider here a feedback control whose aim is to preserve as much as possible an initial maximally entangled states for two - qubit dissipating into their own environments .",
    "actually we shall employ maps and corrective actions much in the spirit of @xcite , without analyzing continuous time evolution .",
    "optimal control is found by first gaining insights from the subsystem purity and then by numerical analysis on the concurrence .",
    "repeated feedback action is also investigated , thus paving the way for a continuous time formulation and solution of the problem .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the model in sec.[sec : model ] .",
    "then we discuss the feedback action in sec.[sec : fb ] and subsequently address its optimality in sec.[sec : opt ] .",
    "sec.[sec : repeat ] is devoted to repeated applications of the dynamical map .",
    "finally , sec.[sec : conclu ] is for conclusion .",
    "we consider two qubits ( distinguished whenever necessary by labels @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) undergoing the effect of local amplitude damping , so that their initial state @xmath2 changes according to the following quantum channel map @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the kraus operators ( satisfying @xmath5 ) constructed from those of local ( single qubit ) amplitude damping channels @xmath6 here @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) is the ground ( resp .",
    "excited ) qubit state and @xmath9 $ ] is the single qubit damping rate .",
    "the map implies the probability for each qubit of losing independently the excitation into its own environment .",
    "suppose that the two qubits are initially prepared in a maximally entangled states , e.g. @xmath10 with @xmath11 in the computational basis @xmath12 , it has the following matrix representation : @xmath13 from here on we assume the freedom to perform local operations ( and eventually classical communication ) , i.e. they are costless .",
    "hence the above assumption of the initial state is equivalent to any other maximally entangled state .    in the computational basis @xmath14 ,",
    "the state @xmath15 resulting from eq .",
    "reads @xmath16 now consider the subsystem purity @xmath17 as measure of entanglement .",
    "although it is only valid for pure states @xmath2 , it can give us some insights also for mixed states entanglement .",
    "thanks to it is straightforward to show that @xmath18 the minimum @xmath19 is achieved for @xmath20 , i.e. when the channel reduces to the identity map .",
    "a faithful measure of entanglement is the concurrence defined as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22s are , in decreasing order , the nonnegative square roots of the moduli of the eigenvalues of @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the complex conjugate of @xmath2 . using",
    "we can show that @xmath25 fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the subsystem purity as well as concurrence resulting from state as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "we can see that they behave opposite one to another .",
    "hence we can argue that parameters minimizing the subsystem purity would also maximizing the concurrence .     for the state @xmath27.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "the map in eq . can be regarded as the effect of a measurement process described by a probability operator valued measure ( povm ) whose elements are @xmath28 and whose",
    "outcomes are labelled by the values of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "notice that the elements @xmath28 are local , hence we consider _ local feedback _",
    "actions @xmath30 su(2)@xmath31su(2 ) to be applied in correspondence of the outcomes @xmath29s .",
    "that is , in the presence of feedback the dynamical map changes into @xmath32 due to the symmetry of the initial state @xmath33 and of the action of the dissipative map , the unitary operators @xmath34s can be taken as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are generic elements of su(2 ) with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 the euler angles .",
    "this model makes fully sense because now once we are given an entangled state the feedback operations are completely local and the aim is to restore as much as possible entanglement ( degraded by the local dissipation ) .",
    "so the goal is to find the euler angles that maximizes the amount of entanglement of @xmath40 .",
