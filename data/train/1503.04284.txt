    "equilibria of three point charges on an ellipse have been discussed in some detail in @xcite .    in this paper , we deal with a specific problem related to our previous research of charged polygonal linkages @xcite .",
    "namely , given a collection of @xmath3 points @xmath0 on a given ( fixed ) closed curve @xmath1 , we wish to investigate if this collection of points is an equilibrium of @xmath4 for a certain system of point charges @xmath5 .",
    "if this is possible , any such collection of charges @xmath5 will be called _ balancing charges _ for @xmath0 .",
    "we also want to investigate if this can be done with positive charges only .",
    "an analogous definition is meaningful and interesting for several other potentials of point interactions , e.g. , for gravitational potential or logarithmic potential in the plane and more general central forces .    in the sequel we deal mostly with the ( electrostatic ) coulomb potential @xmath4 and the @xmath4-equilibrium problem for triples of points on a closed curve in the plane .",
    "we reveal that this problem is closely related to certain geometric issues concerned with the concept of _ caustic _ ( evolute ) of a plane curve and present several results along these lines . in particular , we give a geometric criterion for balancing three points on an arbitrary closed curve ( theorem [ t:3pod ] ) and present a condition for balancing with positive charges ( proposition [ poscharges ] ) .",
    "we give a description of the set of triples which can be balanced on an ellipse , and also a description of the set of triples on an ellipse which can be balanced by positive charges .",
    "some related results and arising research perspectives are discussed in the last section of the paper .",
    "an important observation is that coulomb forces can be replaced by hooke forces produced by ( either compressed or extended ) connecting springs , or by any other _",

    ". then the caustic @xmath54 divides the plane in closed domains . for each of the points @xmath2 of the plane",

    "next we discuss the equilibria with positive charges .",
    "double normals to @xmath1 provide an extra structure .",
    "it is known that each curve has at least two double normals . there",
    "exist curves with infinitely many double normals ( circle other curves of constant width ) but they are highly non - generic , so here we assume that the number of double normals is finite .",
    "assume that an orthotripod changes continuously so that the orthotricenter crosses none of double normals .",
    "then the signs of the balancing charges do not change .    away from double normals ,",
    "balancing charges depend continuously on the orthotripod .",
    "if one of the charges changes the sign , then by proposition [ poscharges ] the orthotricenter crosses a double normal .",
    "double normals yield a further partition of the core of the caustic into smaller ( open ) regions . in each of the regions the three charges form a non - zero triple with constant signs .",
    "in case the points @xmath85 satisfy the corank 1 condition ( i.e. their normals form an orthotripod ) we can search for the balancing charges @xmath45 .",
    "if the rank is exactly two they will define a one - dimensional subspace of @xmath86 . since only the ratio is important , we have a point in @xmath87 .",

    "our original paradigm is given by the case of a circle , considered , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the following can be shown by direct calculations or as corollaries of theorem [ t:3pod ] and proposition [ poscharges ]",
    "any 3 points on a circle can be balanced .",

    "in fact near to the vertex ( on any curve ) we can not have an equilibrium with only positive charges .",
    "several results in this case have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "however some formulations in @xcite are not completely rigorous and one of the aims of our research was to clarify several issues discussed in @xcite in full generality . due to our theorem [ t:3pod ] and propositions [ poscharges ] and [ cau3pod ] we obtain mathematically rigorous statements in the case of three points on the ellipse :    1 .",

    "sheets are now denoted ( with the numbers of the perpendiculars ) by @xmath106 ( no ordering involved ) .",
    "next we label the cusp and the edges of the caustic with the labels of the coinciding normals :    1 .",

    "there are 3 sheets involved and the folding changes from one pair to some other pair of sheets .",
    "see the figures [ fig : patching1 ] and [ fig : patching2 ] for the details about the gluing .",
