    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are instantaneously the most luminous objects in the universe , produced by the deceleration of ultra - relativistic outflow ( lorentz factors @xmath14 ) .",
    "the core - collapse of massive stars are the progenitor of long grbs , and the merger of binary compact stellar objects such as neutron stars ( ns ) and black holes ( bh ) are the possible progenitor of short grbs ( woosley & bloom 2006 , nakar 2007 , berger 2014 ) . in both cases accretion onto a compact object is likely to power the relativistic outflow and the same physical processes are involved .",
    "the outflow energy is first dissipated by internal shocks ( or another form of internal dissipation ) which produces the prompt @xmath15-rays .",
    "later the interaction of the outflow with the ambient medium produces an external shock which expands and produces the subsequent afterglow ( e.g. piran 2004 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "relativistic motion is an essential ingredient in the grb model although the exact outflow formation process is not known .",
    "understanding the nature of the outflow , especially the acceleration , collimation , and energy content is a major focus of international research efforts in the context of grb and other astrophysical jets .",
    "grb outflows are conventionally assumed to be a baryonic jet ( paczynski 1986 ; shemi & piran 1990 ) , although polarization measurements imply that magnetic fields play a role in the jet acceleration ( e.g. steele et al .",

    ". stellar tidal disruption by a massive bh is also likely to produce a relativistic jet ( bloom et al .",

    ", we could gain an insight into the processes that govern the formation of relativistic jets ( e.g. marscher 2006a , nemmen et al . 2012 ) .    in the case of blazars , we can measure apparent superluminal motion ( i.e. lower limits of @xmath1 ) , where reported apparent velocities are as high as @xmath16 for @xmath15-ray bright blazars ( jorstad et al .",
    "2005 ; lister et al 2009 ; piner et al .",

    "the lorentz factor for agn is typically @xmath17 ( e.g. marscher 2006a ; saikia et al .",
    "2016 , etc . ) or @xmath18 ( lister et al . 2009 ) .",
    "blazars with a high@xmath19 overpopulate centimeter - wave surveys of bright flat - spectrum sources because of beaming bias .",
    "alternatively , a volume - limited sample of radio - loud agn would be dominated by objects with more mundane jets .",
    "a power - law distribution of lorentz factors for agn can be assumed , @xmath20 , where population synthesis studies show that a value of @xmath21 between 1.5 and 1.75 provides a good match between a synthetic and observed distribution of apparent velocities ( lister & marscher 1997 ; marscher 2006b ) .",
    "recent work indicates a value of @xmath22 for blazars ( saikia et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "many observations indicate that grbs are produced by ultra - relativistic outflows with @xmath23 .",
    "however , grb progenitors might not always eject such a high@xmath19 flow .",
    "for example , if the outflow is baryonic , the baryon loading might not always be optimal , resulting in lower lorentz factors .",
    "for an outflow with low @xmath1 , the internal dissipation processes ( i.e. @xmath15-ray production ) happen when the outflow is still optically thick .",
    "since we are currently discovering grb events through wide field monitoring of the @xmath15-ray sky ( e.g. swift , fermi , ipn ) , a population of low@xmath19 outflows might be undiscovered .",
    "compact stellar mergers are the most promising targets for ground - based gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors such as advanced ligo , virgo and kagra .",
    "the merger of a binary bh system produced the advanced ligo detection gw150914 , the first direct observation of gw ( abbott et al .",
    "em counterparts to bh - bh mergers are not expected , fermi gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) however , claimed a 2.9@xmath24 detection of a weak @xmath15-ray burst 0.4 seconds after the gw detection ( connaughton et al .",
    "2016 ) , if this burst is associated with gw150914 then an electromagnetic ( em ) afterglow would also be present ( yamazaki et al . 2016 ) . to maximize the science returns from further gw detections , the identification of",
    "an em counterpart will be crucial .",
    "the @xmath15-ray emission from short grbs are an ideal em counterpart to ns - ns / ns - bh mergers , and potentially bh - bh mergers . however , they occur relatively rarely within the range of gw detectors ( 300 mpc for face - on ns - ns mergers ) , this is possibly because @xmath15-ray emission is highly collimated , or the mis - match between short grb peak energies and the swift detection band can make detection more difficult",
    ". additionally the intrinsic rate of compact object mergers within this volume is relatively low .",
    "more isotropic em components such as macronovae are often discussed to localize a large sample of gw events ( e.g. metzger & berger 2012 ; nakar & piran 2011 ; gao et al . 2013 ; kisaka , ioka & takami 2015 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possibility that a significant fraction of compact stellar mergers result in the production of low@xmath19 jets ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "conclusions are given .",
    "observed grbs contain a large fraction of high energy @xmath15-ray photons , which can produce electron - positron pairs if they interact with lower energy photons .",
    "if the optical depth for this process is large , pairs will form rapidly and compton scatter other photons , resulting in an increased optical depth .",
    "the optical depth for the pair creation is very sensitive to the lorentz factor of the source @xmath28 ( e.g. piran 1999 ; lithwick & sari 2001 for the typical high energy spectral index @xmath29 ) . the source becomes optically thin if it is expanding with a lorentz factor @xmath23 .",
    "if there are baryons in grb outflows , another limit on @xmath1 can be obtained by considering the scattering of photons by electrons associated with these baryons ( e.g. lithwick & sari 2001 ) .",
    "note that high polarization results still suggest magnetized baryonic jets , rather than poynting - flux dominated jets ( steele et al .",
    "2009 ; mundell et al .",
    "the optical depth due to these electrons at radius @xmath30 is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath33 is the total isotropic explosion energy and @xmath34 proton mass . outflows",
    "become optically thin at the photospheric radius , @xmath35 where @xmath36ergs and @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",

    ", we obtain @xmath42 . for outflows with a small lorentz factor @xmath43",
    ", the internal dissipation happens when the outflow is still optically thick .",
    "the photons will remain trapped and the thermal energy will be converted back to the kinetic form ( kobayashi & sari 2001 ; kobayashi et al . 2002 ) , and the prompt @xmath15-ray emission would be suppressed ( i.e. failed grbs ) .    usually outflows are assumed to have a sub - relativistic temperature after the internal dissipation , and the internal energy density is comparable to the mass energy density @xmath44 . if a significant fraction of the internal energy is converted to electron - positron pairs , the number density of the electrons and positrons @xmath45 could be larger by a factor of @xmath46 than that of electrons that accompany baryons , where @xmath47 is the electron mass . a more detailed discussion ( lithwick & sari 2001 ) also shows that the scattering of photons by pair - created electrons and positrons is nearly always more important than that by electrons that accompany baryons .",
    "since the lepton pairs create an effective photosphere further out than the baryonic one , the approximation in equation ( [ eq : rph ] ) will provide conservative estimates when we discuss failed grb rates in @xmath27 4 and @xmath27 5 .",
    "even if a jet does not have a velocity high enough to emit @xmath15-rays , it eventually collides with the ambient medium to emit at lower frequencies .",
    "such synchrotron shock radiation has been well studied in the context of grb afterglows ( e.g. mszros & rees 1992 , 1997 ; sari & piran 1999 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "because of relativistic beaming , the radiation from a jet can be described by a spherical model when @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the jet half - opening angle .",
    "we here consider a relativistic shell with an energy @xmath33 and an initial lorentz factor @xmath1 expanding into ism with particle density @xmath50 .",
    "the deceleration of the shell happens at , @xmath51 where @xmath52 protons @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is measured in the grb rest frame .",
    "the typical frequency and the spectral peak flux of the forward shock emission at the deceleration time @xmath54 are , @xmath55 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ; granot & sari 2002 ) where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the microscopic parameters , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 cm ( i.e. the ligo range for face - on ns - ns mergers ) .",
    "the optical emission , assumed to be between the peak frequency @xmath61 and the cooling frequency @xmath62 , is expected to rise as @xmath63 and decay as @xmath64 after the peak @xmath65 .",
    "self - absorption can significantly reduce synchrotron shock emission at low frequencies .",
    "the upper limit can be approximated as black body flux for the forward shock temperature ( e.g. sari & piran 1999 ) , the limit at @xmath54 is @xmath66 where @xmath67ghz and the observable blast - wave size @xmath68 . equalizing the synchrotron emission and the black body limit",
    ", we obtain the self - absorption frequency @xmath69 ghz at the deceleration time @xmath54 .",
    "the self - absorption limit initially increases as @xmath70 , and then steepens as @xmath71 after @xmath61 crosses the observational frequency @xmath72 . considering that the synchrotron flux at @xmath73 also increases as @xmath70 , if @xmath74 at @xmath54 , the synchrotron emission would be reduced by the self - absorption at least until the passage of @xmath61 through the observational band at @xmath75 days .",
    "if the jet break happens while the flux is still self - absorbed , the light curve becomes flat @xmath76 const ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "however , this estimate is obtained by assuming the rapid lateral expansion ( i.e. @xmath77 ) .",
    "recently studies show that the sideways expansion is rather slow especially for mildly - relativistic jets ( granot & piran 2012 ; van eerten & macfadyen 2012 ) .",
    "we will assume that the blast - wave emission starts to decay at the jet break , @xmath78 even if it is in the self - absorption phase . at low frequencies @xmath79 ghz and early times , forward shock emission would be affected by synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "however , currently most radio afterglow observations are carried out at higher frequencies ( e.g. vla 8.5 ghz ) at which self - absorption is more important for the reverse shock emission .    just before the deceleration time",
    "@xmath54 , a reverse shock propagates through the jet and heats the original ejecta from the central engine .",
    "the reverse shock region contains energy comparable to that in the forward shock region .",
    "however , it has a lower temperature due to a higher mass ( i.e. lower energy per particle ) . the shock temperature and the typical frequency are lower by a factor of @xmath80 and @xmath81 compared to those of the forward shock ( e.g. kobayashi & zhang 2003 ) .",
    "although reverse shocks in low-@xmath1 jets could emit photons in the radio band , the self - absorption limit is tighter due to the lower shock temperature ; we find that the forward shock emission always dominates .",
    "note that we rarely catch the reverse shock emission even for regular grbs with detectable @xmath15-ray emission .",
    "we will discuss only the forward shock ( i.e. blast wave ) emission in this paper .",
    "by using the estimates of lorentz factors based on long grb afterglow peak times , hascot et al .",
    "( 2014 ) demonstrated that an apparent correlation between isotropic @xmath15-ray luminosity @xmath82 and lorentz factor @xmath1 can be explained by a lack of bright bursts with low lorentz factors .",
    "they have also predicted the existence of on - axis orphan afterglows of long grb events .",
    "we here extend their argument to short grbs , and we apply their formalism to cosmological ( i.e. @xmath15-ray satellite range ) and local ( i.e. gw detector range ) events to study the on - axis orphan afterglows of failed short grbs ( i.e. low-@xmath1 events ) .",
    "the following assumptions are made in our simple monte carlo simulation of a synthetic population of merger events :    1 .",

    "the jet half - opening angle is not well constrained for short grb jets ( the median value for 248 long grbs is @xmath232 ; fong et al .",

    "if the typical jet half - opening angle of short grbs is @xmath237 , the beaming factor is @xmath238 where @xmath239 , only a small fraction of short grb jets point toward us ( see the black dashed line in figure [ fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "however , since the gw polarization components @xmath240 and @xmath241 depend on the inclination angle @xmath242 of the binary , mergers emit gws much more strongly along the polar axis than in the orbital plane .",
    "considering that the jets from the mergers are also likely to be directed along the polar axis , kochanek & piran ( 1993 ) show that when a grb is associated , the gw amplitude @xmath243 is stronger by a factor of @xmath244 than the amplitude averaged over the sky ( as seen from the source ) .",
    "the distances out to which gw detectors could detect the binary increases by a factor of @xmath245 if the jet points toward us ( we define an on - axis event as any jet where the inclination is within the half - opening angle , @xmath246 ) .",
    "when we consider a sample of merger gw events detected by a gw detector with sensitivity @xmath247 , their jets would tend to be directed to us .",

    "we also conduct a monte carlo simulation to estimate the on - axis probability . in the simulation , mergers",
    "are uniformly distributed in space , with a random inclination angle , and they emit gws with amplitude @xmath250 . after selecting the events detectable by a gw detector : @xmath251",
    ", we evaluate the fraction of the events which have an inclination angle smaller than a given jet half - opening angle @xmath49 ; we assume uniform jets with a top hat distribution throughout from the jet symmetry axis ( e.g. @xmath252 outside of some core angle ) , only the central part could have lorentz factors high enough to produce @xmath15-rays .",
    "although the detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper , the failed grb rate could be even higher for structured jets .",
    "the result ( the red solid line ) does not depend on the detector sensitivity as long as the merger distribution is homogeneous . if we consider gw trigger events , the on - axis probability ( the red solid line ; @xmath253 and @xmath254 for @xmath255 and 33@xmath236 , respectively ) is much higher than the beaming factor ( the black dashed line ) .",
    "although isotropic em counterparts such as macronovae could be ideal to localize a large sample of gw events , @xmath256 of gw events would still be associated with the on - axis orphan afterglow of failed grbs especially when they have wider jet opening angles compared to short grb jets . for long grb jets ,",
    "observational results indicate such a correlation @xmath257 with @xmath258 ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; salmonson & galama 2002 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2002 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "the failed grb rates could be higher than those discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "we have shown that failed grbs are much more frequent than short grbs when the lorentz factors of jets from compact stellar mergers follow a similar power - law distribution as those observed for agn .",
    "for most events the internal dissipation process happens when the jet is still optically thick , and the photons produced by the dissipation process will be converted back to the kinetic energy of the jet . by using a simple monte carlo model , we have shown that even for the local merger population within the ligo / virgo range , the @xmath15-ray emission from jets with @xmath176 will not be detected by @xmath15-ray satellites ( e.g. swift ) . for a power - law distribution of the jet lorentz factors @xmath259 , 78% of compact object mergers that have jets result in a failed grb .",
    "the failed grb events will produce on - axis orphan afterglow at late times .",
    "using the local short grb rate as normalization , the all - sky rate of the on - axis orphan afterglow is about 2.6 and 26 per year for the ns - ns range ( 300 mpc ) and ns - bh range ( 600 mpc ) , respectively .",
    "the opening angle of jets for long grbs was found to be a function of @xmath1 ( e.g. ghirlanda et al .",
    "2013 ) , if low-@xmath1 jets from compact - binary mergers have wider half - opening angles @xmath49 than those of short grbs then the real rate would be higher than these .",
    "we have evaluated the peak time and peak luminosity of the on - axis orphan afterglows in x - ray , optical , and radio bands .",
    "although it is usually difficult to model observational data for orphan afterglow candidates when the explosion time is unknown ( i.e. the @xmath26 issue ) . for gw trigger events , gw signals will provide the explosion time @xmath26 .",
    "the peak time distribution in the x - ray and optical band is rather wide @xmath260 days after the gw signals . although the sky localization of sources by gw detectors is not accurate enough for follow - up observations by most conventional telescopes ( abbott et al .",
    "2016a ) , 85% of the on - axis orphan afterglows are brighter than @xmath261 . the current and upcoming optical transient search ( e.g. iptf / ztf , pan - starrs , goto , blackgem , kiso , skymapper , subaru hsc , lsst ) should be able to detect the optical transients . the x - ray and/or optical detection",
    "can be followed by radio observations ( e.g. vla ) , also several radio instruments have the potential to be leading transient detectors due to their large fov ( e.g. ska , lofar , apertif , mwa ) .",
    "radio emission is expected to peak around @xmath262 days after the merger events .",
    "optical and radio observations will constrain the opening angle of low-@xmath1 jets ( and high @xmath1-jets ) .    since merger jets from gw trigger events tend to be directed to us , the on - axis probability (",
    "e.g. 13% and 44% for @xmath255 and 33@xmath236 , respectively ) is much higher than the beaming factor @xmath263 .",
    "a significant fraction of gw events could be associated with on - axis orphan afterglows .",
    "observations of on - axis orphan afterglows and grb afterglows will enable us to determine the @xmath1 distribution of jets ( e.g. clustered at high-@xmath1 , a power - law distribution , a lognormal , or multiple populations ) , and it will provide constraints on the acceleration process of relativistic jets .",
