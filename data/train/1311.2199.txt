    "such systems have been studied extensively @xcite , most commonly in the context of well - established models of statistical mechanics , population genetics and related models of infinitely - many interacting diffusion processes .",
    "one of the central examples of this literature is the _ parabolic anderson model _",

    "@xmath21 exists and is positive and finite for all real numbers @xmath22 , where @xmath23 [ one can prove that , because of ( [ init ] ) , @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath14 . ]",
    "jensen s inequality readily implies that @xmath24 is nondecreasing on @xmath25 . in the case",
    "that @xmath13 denotes the discrete laplacian on @xmath26 , for example , the theory of carmona and molchanov @xcite implies that @xmath27 this property is referred to as _ intermittency _ and suggests that the random function @xmath28 develops very tall peaks that are distributed over small space  time `` islands . ''",
    "section  2.4 of bertini and cancrini @xcite and section  7.1 of khoshnevisan @xcite describe two heuristic derivations of this `` peaking behavior '' from intermittency condition  ( [ cm - i ] ) .    in the present nonlinear setup , the lyapunov exponents do not generally exist .",
    "therefore , one considers instead the ( maximal ) _ bottom _ and _ top lyapunov exponents _ of the solution @xmath28 to ( [ she ] ) ; those are , respectively , defined as @xmath29 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber \\overline{\\gamma}_k(u ) & : = & \\limsup_{t\\to\\infty } \\sup _ { x\\in{\\mathbf{z}}^d } t^{-1 } \\log{\\mathrm{e}}\\bigl ( \\bigl|u_t(x)\\bigr|^k \\bigr ) . \\ ] ] whenever @xmath30 , we write @xmath21 for their common value and think of @xmath21 as the _ @xmath2th moment lyapunov exponent _ of @xmath28 .    in the present nonlinear setting , intermittency is defined as the property that the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both strictly increasing on @xmath25 . because of convexity",
    ", one can establish intermittency when @xmath33 and @xmath34 for all @xmath22 , @xcite , proposition  7.2 .",
    "we will prove that @xmath35 is generically finite for all @xmath36 ; see theorem  [ th : exist : unique ] . therefore , as far as matters of intermittency are concerned , it remains to establish the positivity of the bottom lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is a nongeneric property . to wit",
    ", when @xmath37 is a constant and @xmath13 is the discrete laplacian on @xmath16 , carmona and molchanov @xcite have shown that @xmath38",
    "if and only if @xmath39 .    this paper is concerned with various results that surround this general topic . as a first example of the type of result that we will establish ,",
    "let us point out the following , which is related to the mentioned peaking property of the parabolic anderson model : one can apply theorem  [ th : exist : unique ] below to the parabolic anderson model in order to see that for all @xmath7 there exist finite and positive constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 such that @xmath42 uniformly for all @xmath8 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is then possible to combine this bound , together with the method of conus et al .",
    "@xcite , in order to estimate the size of the peaks of the solution relative to the spatial variable @xmath14 .",
    "for example , if @xmath13 is finite range , then it is possible to prove that the tall peaks grow at all times as @xmath43 for large values of @xmath44 and more precisely , that @xmath45 we will not establish this fact since it follows fairly readily from ( [ cm - u ] ) and the methods of @xcite . instead let us return to ( [ she ] ) in its nonlinear form .    in general ,",
    "properties such as ( [ cm - u ] ) , whence ( [ peaks ] ) , can be shown to fail .",
    "this is so , for example , when @xmath1 is bounded ; see conus et al .",
    "@xcite for analogous results .",
    "therefore , in order to prove ( [ cm - u ] ) for ( [ she ] ) we need to impose some growth conditions on the nonlinearity @xmath1 .    define @xmath46 because of ( [ eq : sigma(0)=0 ] ) , @xmath47    suppose that @xmath48 and @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "then we will prove that ( [ cm - u ] ) holds , and in particular the lyapunov exponents are always positive and finite ; see theorem  [ th : exist : unique ] . property ( [ cm - u ] ) contrasts sharply with the continuous - space analogues of ( [ she ] ) wherein typically the @xmath2th moment lyapunov exponents are of sharp order @xmath4 as @xmath51 @xcite and implies that , although the intermittency peaks of semi - discrete stochastic pdes grow rapidly with time , they grow far less rapidly than those of fully - continuous stochastic pdes .",
    "not much else seems to be known about the detailed behavior of the lyapunov exponents of the solution to ( [ she ] ) : ours seem to be the only methods that thus far have succeeded in analyzing the asymptotics of the lyapunov exponents of the solution to ( [ she ] ) when @xmath1 is nonlinear and/or @xmath13 is nonlocal ; borodin and corwin have found a few remarkable instances of ( [ she ] ) where all integer - moment lyapunov exponents can be computed precisely .    the second nontrivial contribution of this paper concerns the local behavior of the solution to ( [ she ] ) .",
    "the statement is that there frequently exists a monotone function @xmath52 such that for all @xmath7 fixed , @xmath53 converges to white noise on @xmath16 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 see theorem  [ th : local : radonnikodym ] , and especially theorem  [ th : clt ] , for more details .",
    "one can interpret our result as saying that the function @xmath52 is the infinite - dimensional analogue of the scale function for a finite - dimensional diffusion .",
    "the function @xmath52 is in fact also an abstract hopf  cole transformation for many nonlinear systems of the form ( [ she ] ) ; see @xcite for the role of the latter transformation in the continuous - space parabolic anderson model .    finally , we state and prove perhaps the most interesting contribution of this paper , namely that the solution to ( [ she ] ) is strongly dissipative when ( [ she ] ) is weakly disordered .",
    "see theorem  [ th : as ] for a precise statement .",
    "the latter theorem implies that ( [ she ] ) is a model with hysterisis ; see remark  [ rem : hysteresis ] for more details . theorem  [ th : as ] is also significant because it rules out the possibility of the existence of an anderson mobility edge for the present model ( [ she ] ) , when ( [ she ] ) is weakly disordered .",
    "we are aware only of one such nonexistence theorem , the original stationary anderson model ( but on `` tree graphs '' ) ; see the recent paper by aizenman and warzel @xcite . among other things ,",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th : as ] relies on a comparison theorem for renewal processes , which we state and prove in the [ see lemma  [ lem : re : comparison ] ] .",
    "it is likely that our comparison theorem has other uses in applied probability as well .",
    "in this section we present the main results of this paper .",
    "let us begin by making the assertions in the more precise .",

    "standard moment methods  which we will have to reproduce here as well  show that @xmath68 is almost surely a hlder - continuous random function for every hlder exponent @xmath69 .",

    "[ th : local : radonnikodym ] for every @xmath61 and @xmath8 , @xmath71 in addition , @xmath72 almost surely .",
    "local iterated logarithm laws , such as ( [ eq : local : lil ] ) , are well known in the context of finite - dimensional diffusions ; see , for instance , anderson @xcite , theorem  4.1 .",
    "the time - change methods employed in the finite - dimensional setting will , however , not work effectively in the present infinite - dimensional context . here",
    ", we obtain  ( [ eq : local : lil ] ) as a ready consequence of the proof of the `` random radon ",
    "nikodm property ''  ( [ eq : local : rn ] ) .",
    "fix an @xmath8 and a @xmath7 , and consider the ratio @xmath73/[b_{t+\\tau } ( x)-b_t(x)]$ ] ; this is a well - defined random variable for every @xmath74 , since @xmath75 with probability one for every @xmath74 .",
    "however , @xmath76 is not a well - defined stochastic process since there exist random times @xmath74 such that @xmath77 a.s .",
    "thus one does not expect that the mode of convergence in ( [ eq : local : rn ] ) can be improved to almost - sure convergence .",
    "this statement can be strengthened further still , but we will not do so here .    according to ( [ eq : local : rn ] ) , the solution to the ( [ she ] ) behaves as the noninteracting system `` @xmath78 '' of diffusions , locally to first order .",
    "this might seem to suggest the [ false ] assertion that @xmath79 ought to be a sequence of independent random variables .",
    "this is not true , as can be seen by looking more closely at the time increments of @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , our arguments can be extended to show that the spatial correlation structure of @xmath28 appears at second - order approximation levels in the sense of the following three - term stochastic taylor expansion : in the scale @xmath80 : @xmath81 where : ( i ) `` @xmath82 '' denotes approximation of distributions ; ( ii ) @xmath83 is a standard normal variable independent of @xmath84 ; ( iii ) @xmath85 is a nontrivial random variable that depends on the entire random field @xmath86,y\\in{\\mathbf{z}}^d}$ ] ; ( iv ) @xmath87 as @xmath88 means that @xmath89 .",
    "in particular , ( [ eq : taylor ] ) tells us that the temporally - local interactions in the random field @xmath79 are second order in nature .    rather than prove these refined assertions , we next turn our attention to a different local property of the solution to ( [ she ] ) and show that , after a scale change , the local - in - time behavior of the solution to ( [ she ] ) is that of spatial white noise .
