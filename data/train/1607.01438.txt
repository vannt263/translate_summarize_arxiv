    "social networks have certainly become an important center of attention in our modern information society by transforming human relationships into a huge interchange of , very often , _ sensitive _ data .",
    "there are many truly beneficial consequences when social network data are released for justified mining and analytical purposes .",
    "for example , researchers in sociology , economics and geography , as well as vendors in service - oriented systems and internet advertisers can certainly benefit and improve their performances by a fair study of the social network data .",
    "but , such benefits are definitely _ not _ free of cost as dishonest individuals or organizations may compromise the _ privacy _ of its users while scrutinizing a public social network and may deliberately use such privacy violations for harmful or other unfair commercial purposes . a common way to handle this kind of unwelcome intrusion on the user s privacy",
    "is to somehow _ anonymize _ the data by removing most potentially identifying attributes .",
    "however , even after such anonymization , often it may still be possible to infer many sensitive attributes of a social network that may be linked to its users , such as node degrees , inter - node distances or network connectivity , and therefore _ further _ privacy - preserving methods need to be investigated and analyzed .",
    "these additional privacy - preserving methods of social networks are based on the concept of @xmath0-anonymity introduced for microdata in  @xcite , aiming to ensure that _ no _ record in a database can be re - identified with a probability higher than @xmath1 .",
    "crucial to modelling a social network anonymization process are of course the adversary s background knowledge of any object and the structural information about the network that is available . for example , assuming the involved social network as a simple graph in which individuals are represented by nodes and relationships between pairs of individuals are represented by edges , the adversary s background knowledge about a target ( a node ) could be the node degree  @xcite , the node neighborhood  @xcite , _ etc_. in such scenarios , it frequently suffices to develop attacks to re - identify the individuals and their relationships .",
    "such attacks are usually called _ passive _ ( see  @xcite for more information ) .",
    "some examples of passive attacks and the corresponding privacy - preserving methods for social networks can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , backstrom _",
    "_  introduced the concept of the so - called _ active _ attacks in  @xcite .",
    "such attacks are mainly based on creating and inserting in a network some nodes ( the `` attacker nodes '' ) under control by the adversary .",
    "these attacker nodes could be newly created accounts with pseudonymous or spoofed identities ( commonly called sybil nodes ) , or existing legitimate individuals in the network which are in the adversary s proximity .",
    "the goal is then to establish links with some other nodes in the network ( or even links between other nodes ) in order to create some sort of `` fingerprints '' in the network that will be further released .",
    "clearly , once the releasing action has been achieved , the adversary could retrieve the fingerprints already introduced , and use them to re - identify other nodes in the network .",
    "et  al . _  in  @xcite showed that @xmath2 attacker nodes in a network could in fact seriously compromise the privacy of any arbitrary node . in recent years",
    ", several research works have appeared that deal with decreasing the impact of these active attacks ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . for other related publications on privacy - preserving methods in social networks ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "there are already many well - known active attack strategies for social networks in order to find all possible vulnerabilities .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , not many prior research works have addressed the goal of measuring how resistant is a given social network against these kinds of active attacks to the privacy . to this effect ,",
    "very recently a novel privacy measure for social networks was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the privacy measure proposed there was called the _ @xmath3-anonymity _ , where @xmath0 is a number indicating a privacy threshold and @xmath4 is the _ maximum _ number of attacker nodes that can be inserted into the network ; @xmath4 may be estimated through some statistical methods - anonymity where @xmath4 represented the number of common neighbors of two nodes . ] .",
    "trujillo - rasua and yero in  @xcite showed that graphs satisfying @xmath3-anonymity can prevent adversaries who control at most @xmath4 nodes in the network from re - identifying individuals with probability higher than @xmath1 .",
    "this privacy measure relies on a graph parameter called the @xmath0-metric anti - dimension .",
    "consider a simple connected unweighted graph @xmath5 and let @xmath6 be the length ( number of edges ) of a shortest path between two nodes @xmath7 .",
    "for an ordered sequence @xmath8 of nodes of @xmath9 and a node @xmath10 , the vector @xmath11 is called the _ metric representation _ of @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "based on the above definition , a set @xmath14 of nodes is called a @xmath0-_anti - resolving set _ for @xmath9 if @xmath0 is the largest positive integer such that for every node @xmath15 there exist at least @xmath16 different nodes @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 and @xmath19 have the same metric representation with respect to @xmath13 . the @xmath0-_metric anti - dimension _ of @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath20 , is then the minimum cardinality of any @xmath0-anti - resolving set in @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath0-anti - resolving sets may _ not _ exist in a graph for every @xmath0 .",
    "the connection between @xmath21-anonymity privacy measure and the @xmath0-metric anti - dimension can be understood in the following way .",
    "suppose that an adversary takes control of a set of nodes @xmath13 of the graph ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath13 plays the role of attacker nodes ) , and the background knowledge of such an adversary regarding a target node @xmath12 is the metric representation of the node @xmath12 with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath3-anonymity privacy measure is then a privacy metric that naturally evolves from the adversary s background knowledge .",
    "intuitively , if @xmath13 ( the attacker nodes of an adversary ) is a @xmath0-anti - resolving set then the adversary can not uniquely re - identify other nodes in the network ( based on the metric representation ) from these attacker nodes with a probability higher than @xmath1 ( based on uniform sampling of other nodes ) , and if the @xmath0-metric anti - dimension of the graph is @xmath4 then the adversary must use at least @xmath4 attacker nodes to get the probability of privacy violation down to @xmath1 .",
    "there is a rich literature on theoretical investigations of privacy measures and privacy preserving computational models in several other application areas such as multi - party communications , distributed computing and game - theoretic settings ( _ e.g. _ , see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , none of these settings apply directly to our application scenario of active attack model for social networks .",
    "the differential privacy model , introduced by dwork  @xcite in the context of privacy preservation in statistical databases against malicious database queries , works by computing the correct answer to a query and adding a noise drawn from a specific distribution , and is quite different from the anonymization approach studied in this paper .",
    "it is obviously desirable to know how secure a given social network is against active attacks .",
    "this necessitates the study of computational complexity issues for computing @xmath3-anonymity .",
    "currently known results only include some heuristic algorithms with no provable guarantee on performances such as in  @xcite , or algorithms for very special cases .",
    "in fact , it is not even known if any version of the related computational problems is @xmath22-hard . to this effect , we formalize three computational problems related to measuring the @xmath3-anonymity of graphs and present non - trivial computational complexity results for these problems . the rest of the paper is organized as follows :    1 .   in section  [ sec - termi ]",

    "<S> with the arrival of modern internet era , large public networks of various types have come to existence to benefit the society as a whole and several research areas such as sociology , economics and geography in particular . however , the societal and research benefits of these networks have also given rise to potentially significant privacy issues in the sense that malicious entities may violate the privacy of the users of such a network by analyzing the network and deliberately using such privacy violations for deleterious purposes . </S>",
    "<S> such considerations have given rise to a new active research area that deals with the quantification of privacy of users in large networks and the corresponding investigation of computational complexity issues of computing such quantified privacy measures . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we formalize three such privacy measures for large networks and provide non - trivial theoretical computational complexity results for computing these measures . </S>",
    "<S> our results show the first two measures can be computed efficiently , whereas the third measure is provably hard to compute within a logarithmic approximation factor . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also provide computational complexity results for the case when the privacy requirement of the network is severely restricted , including an efficient logarithmic approximation . </S>"
