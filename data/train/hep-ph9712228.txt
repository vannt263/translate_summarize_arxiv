    "this will be discussed in section  [ secres ] where the results are presented . in the next section some details on the calculation",
    "are given .",
    "in the following the method used for the calculation is briefly described . instead of directly computing",

    "the imaginary part then immediately leads to contributions to @xmath34 .",
    "this avoids the separate treatment of infra - red and collinear divergences and has the advantage that the advanced computational tools available for two - point functions can be used .",
    "in addition , as the top quark is much heavier than all other mass scales involved in the problem , it is tempting to perform an expansion in the inverse top quark mass . the method which provides a systematic expansion in @xmath2",
    "is given by the so - called hard mass procedure ( hmp ) @xcite .",
    "the application of the hmp requires in a first step the identification of all hard subgraphs which contain all lines carrying the large mass and whose connectivity components are one - particle - irreducible with respect to lines corresponding to light or massless particles .",
    "these subgraphs have to be expanded with respect to the small masses and the external momenta . in the full diagram",
    "all lines of the hard subgraph have to be shrunk to a point to give the so - called co - subgraph .",
    "the result of the expansion is inserted as an effective vertex . finally the loop integrations are performed .    at two - loop level seven",
    "diagrams have to be considered .",
    "their calculation would still be feasible by hand . at three loops ,",
    "however , 69 diagrams contribute and a computation by hand is very painful especially if higher order terms in the @xmath2 expansion are considered .",

    "it generates all possible subgraphs of a given diagram together with some auxiliary files which allow the computation to be done automatically .",
    "the output of exp can directly be used as input for matad  @xcite and mincer  @xcite where the loop integration is performed .",
    "it is possible to separate the diagrams at two - loop level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2l ] ) into two classes : if the hmp is applied to the diagrams of type @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 the resulting integrals factorize into massive diagrams with only one mass scale times purely massless ones with external momentum @xmath51 . for the types @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the hmp also leads to a factorization of the original integral . here , however , massive one - loop integrals with two different masses and non - vanishing external momentum have to be computed . at three - loop level , where the same classification is valid , in principle",
    "even the @xmath55 part would be necessary .",
    "for this reason we apply the hmp again to these co - subgraphs with the conditions @xmath56 , or alternatively , @xmath57 . here , @xmath58 is the gauge parameter appearing in the @xmath16 and @xmath59 propagators .",
    "of course , both descriptions must lead to identical final results as the @xmath58 dependence drops out at the very end . in intermediate steps , however , the expressions which have to be evaluated are different .    at the end",
    "@xmath26 has to be chosen .",
    "then the above inequalities are seemingly inadequate . however , a closer look to the corresponding diagrams shows that actually @xmath60 , respectively @xmath61 , has to be compared with @xmath62 .",
    "the procedure is furthermore justified a posteriori as rapidly converging series are obtained from the expansions .",
    "since we are interested in the virtual effect of the top quark which renders the decay of the @xmath4 boson into bottom quarks different from the one into other down - type quarks , in the following the quantity @xmath63 is considered . in this difference",
    "the counterterm contribution exactly cancels .",
    "this means that the renormalized partial decay rate can be written in the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the contribution from the diagrams involving a @xmath16 boson to the partial decay rate @xmath66 @xcite .",
