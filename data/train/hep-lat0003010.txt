    "it is well known that some higgs theories with non - abelian gauge group admit stable monopole solutions  @xcite . in certain cases , most notably in grand unified theories , the residual unbroken gauge group is non - abelian .",
    "it is then particularly interesting to study the interaction between two monopoles , or between monopole and antimonopole , induced by the quantum fluctuations of the unbroken gauge group . beyond the relevance that these interactions may have for the original theory , they can help clarify the low energy properties of the residual theory itself : from the point of view of the low energy theory , monopoles are point - like external sources of non - abelian gauge field , so they act as non - trivial probes of the strong coupling dynamics .",
    "indeed , already some time ago thooft  @xcite and mandelstam  @xcite proposed that condensation of magnetic monopoles could be responsible for the confinement mechanism  @xcite .",
    "if the vacuum state of a non - abelian gauge theory is characterized by the presence of a monopole condensate , this will screen the monopole - antimonopole interaction , which should therefore exhibit a yukawa - like behavior .",
    "if there is no condensate whatever , one should expect instead a coulombic interaction between the monopoles , as is the case in classical su(2 ) theory .",
    "finally , in a theory characterized by a condensation of electric charges , the monopole - antimonopole interaction energy should increase linearly with separation . while a substantial of work has already been done to understand the role of monopole condensation for the confinement mechanism  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge a precise determination of the monopole - antimonopole interaction potential in a quantum non - abelian theory is still lacking . in this paper",
    "we plan to fill this void , presenting a numerical calculation of the monopole - antimonopole potential in the @xmath0 theory .",
    "our results show that the monopole - antimonopole interaction potential is screened , buttressing the conjecture of a monopole condensate .",
    "we also study the monopole - antimonopole system in the high - temperature , deconfined phase of su(2 ) .",
    "the interaction still exhibits screening , which can be ascribed to a magnetic mass .",
    "we will investigate the temperature dependence of this mass .",
    "the procedure for introducing @xmath1 monopole sources on the lattice was devised by ukawa , windey and guth  @xcite and srednicki and susskind  @xcite , who built on earlier seminal results by thooft  @xcite , mack and petkova  @xcite and yaffe  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will follow the method of ref .  @xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "an external monopole - antimonopole pair can be introduced by `` twisting '' the plaquettes transversed by a string joining the monopole and the antimonopole ( see fig .  [ chain ] ) , i.e.  by changing the coupling constant of these plaquettes according to @xmath2 to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an element of the center of the group .",
    "the location of the string is unphysical .",
    "it can be changed by redefining link variables on the plaquettes transversed by the string by @xmath5 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ chain2 ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath6 is an element of the center @xmath1 guarantees that the above redefinition is a legitimate change of variables . on the other hand ,",
    "the position of the cubes that terminate the string can not be changed .",
    "those cubes contain two external monopoles of charge @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ( or , equivalently , a monopole of charge @xmath6 and its antimonopole ) . in the @xmath0 theory we consider in this paper ,",
    "the only non - trivial element of the center of the group is @xmath8 and thus monopole and antimonopole coincide .    in four dimensions ,",
    "a static monopole - antimonopole pair is induced by replicating the string on all time slices .",
    "the insertion of a monopole - antimono - pole pair can be reinterpreted in terms of the electric flux operator and several investigations have been devoted to the study of such operator ( see for instance refs .",
    "however , as we already stated , accurate numerical information on the free energy of a monopole - antimonopole has never been obtained .",
    "the numerical calculation of a free energy by stochastic simulation can be a quite challenging problem , since the free energy is related to the partition function and the partition function , which is the normalizing factor for the simulation , can not be directly measured . in our case , we need the ratio of the partition functions of a system containing the monopole - antimonopole pair to the partition function of the free system . in order to calculate this quantity",
    "we define a generalized system where the coupling constant @xmath2 has been replaced by @xmath9 on all the plaquettes transversed by the string . for sake of precision , if we place the monopole at the spatial location of integer value coordinates @xmath10 and the antimonopole at @xmath11 , the plaquettes with coupling @xmath9 will be all the @xmath12-@xmath13 plaquettes with lower corner in @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 denote the extents of the lattice in the four dimensions .",
    "the @xmath18 offsets in the coordinates of the monopole and antimonopole are due to the fact that we consider them located at the center of two spatial cubes , namely those with lowest corners in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . for the monopole - antimonopole configuration we use periodic boundary conditions",
    ". we will also consider single monopole configurations .",
    "for these we use periodic boundary conditions only in time and the two spatial directions orthogonal to the string , while we choose free boundary conditions in the spatial direction parallel to the direction of the string .",
    "we let the string run from the mid - point of the lattice to the free boundary .",
    "this places a single monopole in the middle of the lattice and emulates as well as possible a configuration where the antimonopole has been removed to infinity .",
    "let us denote by @xmath21 the set of all the plaquettes with modified coupling constant .",
    "the action of the modified system is then @xmath22 and the corresponding partition function is @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the set of all configurations . for @xmath25",
    "our generalized system obviously reduces to a homogeneous @xmath0 lattice gauge system with coupling constant @xmath2 , whereas for @xmath26 it becomes an @xmath0 model with a static monopole - antimonopole pair . in this latter case , as discussed above , the partition function becomes independent on the actual location of the string , and depends only on the distance @xmath27 between monopole and antimonopole ( beyond depending , of course , on @xmath2 and the extent of the lattice ) .",
    "the change of free - energy induced by the presence of the pair is thus @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the temperature of the system ( @xmath30 denotes , as usual , the lattice spacing ) .",
    "this is the quantity we want to calculate . for @xmath9",
    "not equal to @xmath31 , @xmath32 does depend on the location of the string .",
    "nevertheless eq .  [ modified ] continues to define the partition function of a statistical system , which we will use for our calculation of @xmath33 .",
    "the basic idea is that we will perform monte carlo simulations of the modified system for a set of values of @xmath9 ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath34 which is sufficiently dense that for all steps in @xmath9 we can reliably estimate the change induced in @xmath35 .",
    "conceptually this corresponds to the observation that for an infinitesimal change in @xmath9 the change in free energy will be @xmath36 and thus the free energy of the monopole pair can be computed as @xmath37 where the integrand in the r.h.s .",
    "is an observable , namely the energy @xmath38 of the strip of plaquettes transversed by the string .",
    "however , implementing eq .",
    "[ integral ] would be inefficient , due to the large number of subdivisions that the numerical integration would require for accuracy .",
    "rather , we calculate @xmath33 by following the ferrenberg - swendsen multi - histogram method  @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose a set of @xmath39 values @xmath40 ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 . in the actual calculation , we chose them equally spaced , although this is not necessary .",
    "the number @xmath43 is determined by a criterion that will be explained below . for each value @xmath44 we perform a monte carlo simulation of the corresponding system and record the values of the energy @xmath45 of the plaquettes transversed by the string ( see eq .  [ energy ] ) in a histogram @xmath46 .",
    "more exactly , in our calculation rather than simply accumulating the entries in the histograms , we distributed the measured energy values over the four neighboring vertices according to the weights of a cubic interpolation formula .",
    "this substantially increases the accuracy when the values in the histograms are subsequently used to approximate integrals over the density of states : @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the total number of entries in the histogram .",
    "indeed , by using this procedure , we were able to reduce the number of bins to @xmath49 without noticeable discretization effects .    from each separate histogram one can obtain an independent estimate of the density of states @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the partition function for the specific value @xmath44 and @xmath52 is the total number of histogram entries .",
    "of course , the normalizing factors @xmath51 are still not known .",
    "indeed , the entire goal of the computation is to calculate the relative magnitude of the partition functions @xmath51 . starting from eqs .",
    "[ rhoi ] one can however obtain the partition functions @xmath51 up to a common constant of proportionality by a self - consistent procedure .",
    "we start from the crude approximation that all @xmath51 are equal .",
    "since we are only interested in ratios of partition functions , we can set this common value to 1 .",
    "we combine then the estimates of the density of states given by eqs .",
    "[ rhoi ] into a first approximation @xmath53 from this value of the density of states we can now obtain a better approximation of the partition functions @xmath54 equations  ( [ rhoi]-[partf ] ) can now be iterated to get @xmath51 up to a multiplicative factor .",
    "if the iterations converge , the final results will provide a self - consistent set of values for the partition functions @xmath51 , up to a common constant .",
    "in particular , we will be able to obtain @xmath55 and the free energy of the monopole - antimonopole pair .",
    "a necessary condition for the above procedure to work well is that the histograms corresponding to adjacent @xmath9 have a sufficient overlap . in fig .",
    "[ multihisto ] we plot the histograms obtained in a typical run and one can see that they exhibit indeed a substantial overlap .",
    "in our calculation we found that the self - consistent procedure outlined above converged rapidly for all the values of lattice size , coupling constant and monopole - antimonopole separation we considered .",
    "we checked that the results for the free energy we obtained with the multihistogram method are consistent with the values one can obtain from the numerical integration of @xmath56 ( cfr .",
    "eq .  [ integral ] ) , within the error of the latter procedure .",
    "we simulated a pure @xmath0 system with a combined overrelaxation and multihit - metropolis algorithm for minimal autocorrelation time .",
    "we studied systems with coupling constants varying between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , spatial sizes ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath60 and euclidean temporal extents ranging from @xmath61 down to @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding temperatures span the deconfinement phase transition , which occurs at @xmath63 for @xmath64 and between @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath57 and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "full details of lattice sizes and couplings used in our simulations are given in table [ runs ] .",
    "for each lattice size , value of @xmath2 and monopole separation , we performed a sequence of simulations , starting with @xmath68 and decreasing @xmath9 in steps ( cfr .",
    "[ sec : free ] ) to its final value @xmath26 .",
    "precisely , we performed @xmath69 thermalization steps at @xmath68 followed by measurements separated by @xmath70 updates .",
    "we decreased @xmath9 , performed another @xmath71 thermalization followed by the same number of measurements , again separated by @xmath70 updates , and so on , until completion of the measurements with @xmath26 . for each measurement , as a variance reduction technique , we performed @xmath72 upgrades of the links in the plaquettes belonging to the flux tube @xmath21 , while keeping all other link variables fixed . in this way",
    ", we obtained @xmath72 histogram entries per configuration .",
    ".[runs]lattice sizes and couplings at which the simulation was performed . [ cols=\">,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to compare our results to the solutions of the classical theory . since to the best knowledge of the authors",
    "there is no analytical solution to the classical two monopole problem , we have investigated its properties numerically . to do this",
    ", we found the minimal energy solutions on a lattice and checked their behavior .",
    "we put the classical system on a 3-dimensional lattice with free boundary conditions .",
    "( we used free boundary condition because the calculation itself shows that the potential has a long range behavior and with free boundary conditions we can reduce finite size effects . )",
    "we started both from a random non - abelian configuration and and from a random abelian configuration and performed iterative local minimization to relax the system to its lowest energy state .",
    "there were no surprises as we found that for both initial conditions the system relaxed to a minimal energy state of the same energy and that the non - abelian solution , after going to a maximally abelian gauge , turned out to be entirely abelian in nature . also , the potential of interaction was well fit by the coulomb form @xmath73 .",
    "( one expects a coefficient 1/4 in the coulomb potential because the total magnetic flux from the monopole is @xmath74 .",
    "this value has been numerically confirmed in our calculation . )    in figure  [ compare ] we compare the monopole - antimonopole potentials in the confined phase of the quantum system and in the classical system .",
    "the comparison shows a clear difference between the classical and quantum case and reinforces the conclusion that quantum fluctuations introduce a screening of magnetic monopoles .",
    "we further illustrate this point by displaying in fig .",
    "[ pic ] snapshots of a typical quantum configuration ( from a simulation at @xmath57 and @xmath75 ) and of the classical solution . in the pictures ,",
    "vectors show the magnetic field in a maximal abelian projection and the size of the dots measure the non - abelian character of the configuration at that point ( it is proportional to the square of the components orthogonal to the abelian projection ) . in the classical case",
    "the location of the monopole - antimonopole pair is evident . in the quantum case",
    "it is marked by the crosses in the middle of the second picture .",
    "had we not marked the location of monopole and antimonopole in the quantum case , the reader would be hard pressed in finding where they are .",
    "the marked difference between the classical and quantum configurations gives a vivid illustration of how the quantum fluctuations of the gluon field provide a mechanism for the screening of external monopole sources , which is most likely also responsible for confinement in the low temperature phase and for the emergence of the magnetic mass in the high temperature phase .",
    "we have measured the free energy of a monopole - antimonopole pair in pure su(2 ) gauge theory at finite temperature .",
    "we find that the interaction is screened in both the confined and deconfined phase .",
    "the mass of the object responsible for the screening at low temperature is approximately twice the established value for the lightest glueball , indicating a prevalent coupling to glueball excitations .",
    "there is no noticeable discontinuity in the screening mass at the deconfinement transition , but in the deconfined phase we clearly see an increase of the screening mass with temperature .",
    "our results support the hypothesis of existence of monopole condensate in the vacuum of the su(2 ) theory and provide evidence that some glueball excitation could serve as a `` dual photon '' in the dual superconductor hypothesis of quark confinement .",
    "finally , we would like to observe that the method we have developed for the calculation of the monopole - antimonopole free energy is applicable to other models , beyond the su(2 ) theory considered in this paper . while moderately demanding in computer resources , it appears capable of producing accurate numerical results for the monopole - antimonopole potential of interaction .",
    "thus it could be used to shed light on the dynamics of other interesting systems that are expected to exhibit the formation of electric or magnetic condensates in their vacuum states .",
