    "the chiral phase transition is a main feature of qcd . in the instanton picture @xcite",
    "the chirally broken phase is represented by an ensemble of weakly interacting instantons and anti - instantons . due to the fermionic quasi zero modes of the ( anti- ) instantons , a finite density of eigenvalues , @xmath2 ,",
    "is generated near zero in a ( large ) volume @xmath3 , and according to the banks - casher formula  @xcite @xmath4 chiral symmetry is broken . in the chirally symmetric phase instantons and anti - instantons form",
    "strongly bound molecules , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator move towards the bulk of the spectrum and the eigenvalue density vanishes near the origin . of course one would like to verify the essential parts of this picture in qcd .",
    "therefore we study the localization properties of the eigenmodes of the lattice dirac operator in the neighborhood of the chiral phase transition . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have investigated this question with the wilson gauge action on smaller lattices . here",
    "we present results obtained on larger lattices with the lscher - weisz gauge action .",
    "the temporal extension @xmath5 of the lattice is related to the temperature @xmath6 by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lattice spacing . due to the periodic boundary condition in the time direction ,",
    "an instanton becomes a chain of instantons which one calls caloron @xcite .",
    "the properties of a caloron are similar to that of an instanton : a caloron has topological charge one and a localized left - handed fermionic zero mode .",
    "however , the localization pattern of the zero mode is different .",
    "whereas in the case of an instanton the zero mode is localized in space and time , the zero mode of a caloron is localized in space but delocalized in time .",
    "let us now compare the localization of the zero mode in the different sectors of the polyakov loop @xmath9 .",
    "we know that in the deconfined phase @xmath9 clusters around the values @xmath10 , with @xmath11 ( real sector ) and @xmath12 ( complex sector ) @xcite .",
    "because the fermionic action does not share the @xmath0 symmetry of the gauge action , the localization of the eigenmodes of the dirac operator can depend on the polyakov loop sectors .",
    "indeed one finds that the zero mode @xmath13 of the caloron is more localized in the real sector than in the complex sector , as can be seen from @xcite @xmath14/r^2.\\ ] ] next we will search for caloron - like configurations concentrating on the fermionic properties of the caloron described above .",
    "we work in the quenched approximation with the lscher - weisz gauge action @xmath15 & = & \\textstyle \\beta_1 \\sum_{pl } \\frac{1}{3 } { \\mathrm{re}}\\ ; { \\mathrm{tr}}\\ ; [ 1 - u_{pl } ] +   \\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\textstyle \\beta_2 \\sum_{rt } \\frac{1}{3 } { \\mathrm{re}}\\ ; { \\mathrm{tr}}\\ ; [ 1 - u_{rt } ] + \\nonumber \\\\    &   & \\textstyle \\beta_3 \\sum_{pg } \\frac{1}{3 } { \\mathrm{re}}\\ ; { \\mathrm{tr}}\\ ; [ 1 - u_{pg } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 means a summation over all plaquettes , @xmath19 rectangles and parallelograms , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are computed from @xmath22 via tadpole improved pertubation theory .",
    "further we use the staggered dirac operator @xmath23 \\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath25 come in pairs of @xmath26 with @xmath27 real , so we can restrict ourselves to positive @xmath27 in the following . in the continuum limit",
    "this action corresponds to four quark flavors . from now on we set @xmath8 to 1 .",
    "we have calculated the lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors for lattice sizes @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 below the deconfinement phase transition at @xmath31 ( @xmath32 @xcite ) and above at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 @xcite ) with the arnoldi method  @xcite .",
    "we will present data for the largest lattice at @xmath35 .",
    "when searching for calorons on the lattice with the help of their fermionic properties , the zero mode of the dirac operator plays the central role . unfortunately the staggered dirac operator has no exact zero modes , but , as we can see clearly in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there are for both polyakov loop sectors low - lying eigenmodes with a high value of @xmath36 and eigenmodes in the bulk of the spectrum with values of @xmath37 around zero .",
    "we find that the low - lying eigenvalues are quasi 4-fold degenerate in the sense that the number of low - lying eigenmodes is almost always 4 , 8 , 12 ,   ( in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] this is illustrated by the encircled eigenmodes , which belong to the same gauge field configuration .",
    "note that the total number of low - lying eigenmodes of that configuration is 8 . )",
    "so one would expect that those low - lying eigenmodes correspond to exact zero modes with definite handedness in the continuum .",
    "let us now look at the localization properties of these approximate zero modes .",
    "we define a gauge - invariant measure of the localization of a quark eigenmode @xmath38 ( @xmath27 is the dirac eigenvalue , @xmath39 a color index ) , the inverse participation ratio @xmath40 ^ 2}\\ : ,    \\label{idef}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the number of lattice sites and @xmath41 is the gauge - invariant probability density @xmath42 . for a completely delocalized state ( all @xmath43 the same ) one finds @xmath44 , whereas a state localized on a single lattice site ( only one non - zero @xmath43 ) would have @xmath45 . in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot @xmath46 vs.  @xmath47 .",
    "we see that the modes in the real sector are , in general , more localized than those in the complex sector . in both polyakov loop sectors",
    "the approximate zero modes have a greater value of @xmath46 than the modes in the bulk spectrum , which means that they are more localized .",
    "these are exactly the properties we expect for caloron configurations .",
    "finally we consider the localization pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] isosurfaces of @xmath48 and the local chirality @xmath49 are plotted at fixed @xmath50 and at fixed @xmath51 for one of the encircled eigenmodes .",
    "this ( typical ) mode is clearly localized in space but not in time and the isosurfaces for @xmath48 and @xmath52 are very similar .",
    "this is again as is expected for caloron - like configurations .",
    "studying the localization and chirality properties of low - lying quark eigenstates in quenched lattice qcd , we could characterize semiclassical properties of the gauge field configurations without any cooling . for temperatures above @xmath1 we found isolated modes with definite handedness .",
    "they are localized in space but not in time with characteristic differences between the polyakov loop sectors .",
    "thus they show essential properties of quark states associated with calorons .",
