    "4u0352 + 309/xpersei is a classical persistent be / x - ray binary system , consisting of an x - ray pulsar and a be star companion optically identified with the star hd24534 .",
    "it was discovered during a high x - ray intensity state in 1972 ( for simplicity below such high states are referred to as outbursts ) , when pulsations with a period of @xmath6 s were detected by the _ copernicus _",
    "observatory @xcite .",
    "the distance to the source was estimated by different authors in the range of 700 to 1300 pc . in this paper",
    "we used the value of @xmath7 pc obtained by @xcite . adopting this distance the source peak luminosity @xmath8  in the @xmath9 kev energy range",
    "was registered in 1975 .",
    "the close proximity allowed the source to be observed in x - rays by different missions and experiments after 1978 , despite its relative low luminosity @xmath10 .    for a long time",
    "xpersei was the only known persistent x - ray pulsar in be - systems , until @xcite pointed out the existence of a subclass of binaries with be companions which harbor a slowly rotating neutron star and are characterized by a persistent low - luminosity x - ray emission and , probably , a long orbital period .",
    "soon after , @xcite succeeded in determining orbital parameters for xpersei and showed that the pulsar is in a moderately eccentric orbit ( @xmath11 ) with a @xmath12 days orbital period .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a similarly long orbital period of @xmath13 days for another x - ray pulsar rxj0440.9 + 4431 , which belongs to this subclass as well .",
    "usually spectra of x - ray pulsars have an exponential cutoff at energies about @xmath1420 kev ( see , e.g. , the recent review of * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . however results of the _ ginga _ observatory gave evidence for the presence of a hard tail in the spectrum of xpersei above @xmath15 kev@xcite . based on data of the _ bepposax _ observatory",
    ", @xcite showed that its broadband spectrum can be described by a combination of the standard model and a power law with both high- and low - energy cut - offs , which dominates above @xmath16 kev .",
    "later @xcite suggested that the thermal component with temperature of @xmath17 kev is typical for spectra of low luminosity , long period be / ns binaries .",
    "similar to other accreting pulsars , the history of the xpersei pulse period shows episodes of both spin - up and spin - down .",
    "previous to 1978 its spin history was erratic , with a general spin - up trend at a rate of @xmath18 yr@xmath5 . since 1978 the neutron star has been spinning down with a similar rate @xmath19 yr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "note that the spin - up episode in 1975 - 1978 coincided with the decay phase of the outburst .",
    "be stars are known to have a dense slow disk - like equatorial wind along with a low - density fast wind at higher latitudes .",
    "xpersei has shown large variations in optical and infrared brightness ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and in the strength of the emission balmer line ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these variations are usually interpreted as changes in the physical properties ( density , geometry ) of the be star equatorial disk .",
    "the bright state of the star correlates with the presence of the emission lines and is evidence of the equatorial disk presence . at the same time , as it was mentioned by @xcite , the strong variability seen in the optical and infrared is not reflected in the x - ray light curve .",
    "particularly , the 1975 peak of the x - ray flux happened during the diskless state , while during the 1990 diskless state no x - ray brightening was observed .",
    "the absence of a direct correlation between the optical and x - ray light curves excludes the possibility that the neutron star is always accreting from the be disc , probably due to the truncation of the disc @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the detailed study of the correlation between optical and x - rays was hampered by the absence of continuous measurements of the source flux in x - rays .    in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the properties of the x - ray pulsar xpersei over the period 1996 to 2011 , encompassing the quite low state and subsequent strong outbursts activity .",
    "thanks to the _ rxte _ and _ swift _ observatories , which have regularly monitored the whole sky in the last decades , we are able to look for the first time for a correlation between x - ray and optical data on a time scale from days to years . moreover , based on data from the _ integral _ and _ rxte _ observatories we traced the evolution of the source pulse period and its spectral parameters during outbursts .",
    "we also used deep observations of the _ integral _ observatory to detect for the first time a hard x - ray emission from the pulsar up to @xmath3 kev at a high significance level .",
    "in this work we use data obtained with the _ rxte _ @xcite and _ integral _ @xcite observatories . in particular , we used data of the _ asm / rxte _ monitor to trace the long - term behavior of the xpersei flux in the soft energy band ( @xmath22 kev ) . to compare it with the source behavior in hard x - rays we used observations of the _ ibis / integral _ and _ bat / swift _ telescopes @xcite . in the standard x - ray energy band ( @xmath2 kev ) data from the _ pca / rxte _ instrument ( obs.id",
    "30099 , 40424 , 50404 , 60067 , 60068 ) were used to study the variability of the source spectrum and pulse period .    in 2003 - 2006",
    "xpersei was in the field of view of telescopes of the integral observatory only episodically . during deep observations of sky fields around the source in 2008 - 2010 the effective exposure of both x - ray telescopes of the observatory , _ jem - x _ and _ ibis / isgri _ , rose up to @xmath23 ksec and @xmath24 msec , respectively .",
    "the reduction of the _ isgri _ detector data was done using recently developed methods described by @xcite . the source spectrum from the _",
    "jem - x _ telescope was extracted with the standard _ osa _",
    "package version 9.0 . for timing analysis",
    "the _ ibis _ data was processed with the software developed and maintained in the national astrophysical institute in palermo ; a description of the data processing technique can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    to build a complete picture of the secular variability of the xpersei pulse period we included in our analysis data from the _ xmm - newton _ observatory that observed the source twice in feb 2003 and feb 2010 ( obs.id . 0151380101 and 0600980101 , respectively ) .",
    "version 11.0 of the _ xmm - newton science analysis system sas _ was used to process the data .",
    "the final spectral and timing analysis for all x - ray instruments was done using the standard tools of the ftools / lheasoft 6.7 package .    to search for a correlation between the source outbursts activity in x - rays and optics ( @xmath25-band )",
    ", we took data from the aavso international database .",

    "the grey box indicates an interval with simultaneous _ bat / swift _ observations .",

    "were averaged over 30 and 20 days for _ asm / rxte _ and _ bat / swift _ , respectively , while _ isgri / integral _ measurements were averaged over one spacecraft revolution ( about three days ) .",
    "[ fig : xray_lc ] ]    the xpersei light curve obtained with the _ asm / rxte _ monitor in 1996 - 2011 indicates that during the first years of observations the source intensity was low and relatively stable at the level of @xmath27 mcrab , that corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath5 in the @xmath9 kev energy band for the adopted distance ( fig.[fig : xray_lc ] ) .",
    "such a level of intensity is typical for the normal ( low ) state of the pulsar , which had been observed since the end of 1970s ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in 2000 - 2001",
    "the source flux began to steadily increase and reached a maximum ( @xmath29 mcrab ) in may 2003 .",
    "it then dropped very quickly ( within 4 - 5 months ) by a factor of two and stayed near this level until 2008 , when it began to increase again .",
    "the source flux at the new maximum ( may 2010 ) was approximately the same as the preceding one . and",
    "again it dropped very quickly by a factor of 2 ( fig.[fig : xray_lc ] ) .    the described source behavior at soft energies , as registered by the _ integral _ ( 20 - 60 kev ) and _ swift _ ( 15 - 50 kev ) observatories ( fig.[fig : xray_lc ] ) , almost completely mirrors the source variability in hard x - rays .",
    "the source outburst activity continued during 2011 , when a third outburst with a slightly lower intensity was detected by the _",
    "swift _ observatory .",
    "a comparison of x - ray light curves of xpersei from fig.[fig : xray_lc ] with the source long - term behavior reported by @xcite shows that a similar outburst activity was observed more than 35 years ago , in the middle of 1970s , with the _ ariel v _ and _ copernicus _ observatories .",
    "moreover , the maximal flux from the source in 1975 , was even slightly higher that measured in 2003 and 2010 and corresponded to a source luminosity of @xmath30 erg s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "besides these large outbursts with durations of years , the light curves of xpersei demonstrate a tentative variability with the amplitude of about @xmath31 mcrab .",
    "to search for a possible correlation of these source intensity variations with the orbital phase , we folded _",
    "asm / rxte _ and _ bat / swift _ light curves with a period of @xmath32 days @xcite , but we did not find any significant deviations from the constant either in soft or in hard x - rays . finally , note that the intensity rise , which has been very smoothly for several hundred days for all observed outbursts from xpersei , is non - typical for outbursts from usual transient sources ( like black holes or transient x - ray pulsars ) .",
    "it can be connected with other mechanisms or processes responsible for the outburst activity in the source under investigation .      ]",
    "the secular variability of the xpersei pulse period is presented in fig.[fig : pulseper ] .",
    "it includes results of measurements taken from the literature and calculations performed in this work .",
    "the photon arrival times have been preliminarily corrected to the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "after that the epoch folding method has been applied to determine the period of the pulsar .",
    "the errors in the period were estimated by the method briefly described by @xcite . to calculate them we performed an analysis of @xmath33 simulated light curves .",
    "data in each light curve were generated arbitrarily inside the error bars of the original data points .",
    "after that the best period for each simulated light curve was determined .",
    "finally we computed the standard deviation of the best periods distribution and used this value as an estimation of the pulse period error .    due to the faintness of the source and a relatively long pulse period ( @xmath34 min ) observations with an exposure of several hours ( at least )",
    "are needed to determine the pulse period somewhat accurately .",
    "this was not a problem for _ integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations , where exposures were about several dozen ksec , but the typical duration of one _ rxte _ observation is only several ksec .",
    "therefore we grouped closely spaced _",
    "rxte _ observations into one set ( when possible ) and calculated the pulse period for each of them .",
    "data of the _ xmm - newton _ observatory were highly affected by event pile - up due to a very high count rate .",
    "therefore in our analysis we used the same approach as @xcite and considered only data from the annulus area , excluding the central part of the source psf . applying the standard processing described in the _ sas _ v.11 cookbook we determined the pulse period of xpersei : @xmath35 and @xmath36 sec for february 2003 and february 2010 , respectively .",
    "the quality of the data during the last observation was much better than during the first one as its duration was longer ( @xmath37 ksec vs @xmath38 ksec ) , therefore the corresponding uncertainty is lower .",
    "the obtained value of the pulse period in february 2003 is slightly lower than the value reported by @xcite .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this difference : we used a more recent version of _ sas _ , and we used the data from _ mos _ cameras only .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite data of the @xmath39 camera were affected not only by photon pile - up , but during that observation the source was imaged close to a ccd gap .",
    "finally , note that our value of the xpersei pulse period for february 2003 agrees well with the measurements from the _ integral _ observatory , performed in april 2003 ( see fig.[fig : pulseper ] ) .",
    "measurements from the _ integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories indicate that sometime before the 2003 source flux maximum a deceleration of the neutron star rotation , which had lasted from 1978 , changed to an acceleration ( fig.[fig : pulseper ] ) .",
    "this repeats approximately the pulse period behavior during the outburst in 1974 - 1978 , when the spin - up episode coincided with its declining phase , but started @xmath40 days after the luminosity maximum @xcite .",
    "the average spin - up rate since 2003 @xmath41 yr@xmath5 is higher than the one observed between 1974 - 1978 .",
    "moreover , measurements of the _ integral _ observatory suggest the presence of something like a plateau in the pulse period history during the time interval mjd @xmath42 , when the source flux was more or less stable between the first and second outbursts .",
    "in such a case the pulsar is spinning - up only during outbursts with the even higher rate of @xmath43 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the high spin - up rate can be probably connected with additional matter and angular momentum transfer to the neutron star due to the continuing source high state after the first outburst , and subsequent outbursts .",
    "this picture can be naturally explained in terms of the current theory of quasi - spherical accretion in low - luminosity x - ray pulsars @xcite . in particular , the observed spin - up / spin - down transitions correlate with changes of the source luminosity , and their numerical values reflect the ratio of x - ray fluxes during spin - up and spin - down ( see fig.1 and eqs .",
    "56 - 58 in * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the plateau at the pulse period history is apparently connected with the equilibrium state of the pulsar . using the equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 s is the equilibrium period , @xmath46 is the neutron star magnetic moment in units @xmath47",
    "g @xmath48 , which can be calculated from the measured magnetic field ( see below ) , @xmath49 is the accretion rate in units @xmath50 g / s , deriving from the source luminosity , and @xmath51 is the relative wind velocity ( in units @xmath52 cm / c ) , we can estimate @xmath51 as @xmath53 km / s , which agrees with measured or suggested values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted by @xcite , pulsations from the source are detected up to 100 kev .",
    "the pulse fraction increases from @xmath54% in the @xmath9 kev energy band to @xmath55% in the @xmath26 kev energy band , typical for x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "kev model flux of xpersei during the rising part of the first outburst as measured with the _ pca / rxte _ instrument ( see text for details ) .",
    "[ fig : pca_par1 ] ]    observations of xpersei with the _ pca _ instrument of the _ rxte _ observatory were performed several dozens of times in 2000 - 2003 .",
    "they cover the low state and the rising phase of the first outburst very well .",
    "it allowed us to study a dependence of the source spectral shape variability on its intensity .    using _ rxte / pca _ data we built a set of source spectra in the @xmath2 kev energy band and approximated them in a model that includes interstellar absorption , powerlaw and black - body components (",
    "_ wabs , powerlaw and bbodyrad _ models in the _ xspec _ package ) .",
    "interstellar absorption in the direction of the source is quite low ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 and can not be determined correctly with the _ pca _ instrument .",
    "it was fixed at the value of @xmath58 @xmath57 as measured by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "dependencies of the black - body temperature @xmath59 , the radius of the emission surface of the thermal component @xmath60 , the photon index @xmath61 and the normalization of the non - thermal component @xmath62 with time are shown in fig.[fig : pca_par1 ] along with the changes of the source flux in the @xmath63 kev energy band , which was calculated from the best fit spectral models .",
    "it is clearly seen that the photon index remains very stable during the whole period of observations and its value @xmath64 is in a good agreement with broadband spectral measurements performed with the _ integral _ observatory ( see below ) . at the same time , the normalization of the non - thermal component @xmath62 increases with the source brightness by a factor of @xmath65 .",
    "this increase is more significant in comparison with the extension of the emission surface of the thermal component from @xmath66 m to @xmath67 m that should lead to the increase in the relative contribution of the non - thermal component to the total source spectrum with the source brightening .",
    "but quantitatively this increase is practically negligible due to the simultaneous growth of the black - body temperature @xmath59 from @xmath68 to @xmath69 kev ( fig.[fig : pca_par1 ] ) , that in turn leads to the growth of the thermal component flux .",
    "it is important to note that measured values of the thermal component parameters ( black - body temperature and radius ) agree with previous results of @xcite , but are different from the ones obtained with _ xmm - newton _ @xcite  the temperature is slightly higher , the radius is lower by a factor of two .",
    "this difference is due to the different energy bands of the observatories : @xmath70 kev for _ xmm - newton _ and @xmath2 kev for _",
    "rxte_. naturally , the capabilities of the _ xmm - newton _ observatory are much more suitable for a correct determination of quantitative characteristics of the thermal emission with temperatures of @xmath71 kev . therefore the _ rxte _ data reflect only the qualitative behavior ( relative changes ) of its parameters as the source flux increases .",
    "in addition to the long - term changes , the source x - ray flux demonstrates variability on the time scale of several days , which became especially significant ( like flares ) with the growth of the source average flux ( fig.[fig : pca_par1 ] , bottom panel , see also fig.2 from * ? ? ?",
    "such flares are accompanied with the variability of the source spectral parameters , mainly its thermal component .",
    "note that flares with changes of the spectrum hardness were observed earlier during the high luminosity states in 1970s @xcite .",
    "xpersei was observed by the",
    "_ integral _ observatory with a very long exposure in 2008 - 2010 .",
    "taking into account that 1 ) the source intensity did nt change significantly during these observations ( fig.[fig : xray_lc ] ) and that 2 ) the hard non - thermal spectral component is very stable even when the source flux is variable ( see previous section ) , we could use all these data to reconstruct the broadband spectrum of xpersei . in the resulting spectrum ,",
    "the signal from the source is significantly detected up to @xmath72 kev ( fig.[fig : int_spec]a ) for the first time . to date ,",
    "hard x - ray emission at energies @xmath73 kev has been detected from only one other low luminosity x - ray pulsar rxj0440.9 + 4431 @xcite .",
    "as a first step the source spectrum was approximated by the powerlaw model with a high - energy cutoff that is typical for x - ray pulsars @xcite kev as the sensitivity of the _ jem - x _ telescope is much lower in a comparison with _",
    "pca / rxte_. moreover , due to problems with the _ jem - x _ response matrix energy channels around 6 - 7 kev were excluded from the analysis according to recommendations of the isdc helpdesk ( private communication ) ] .",
    "however this model gives an unacceptable value of @xmath74 for 45 d.o.f .",
    "deviations of the measured spectrum from the model ( fig.[fig : int_spec]b ) demonstrate a wide absorption feature near @xmath75kev , which can be interpreted as a cyclotron resonance absorption line and which was found earlier by @xcite based on the _ rxte _ data .",
    "an additional component in the form of _ gabs _ ( _ xspec _ ) : @xmath76 , improves the fit significantly to @xmath77 for 42 d.o.f .",
    "the resulting parameters of the cyclotron ine  the line energy @xmath78 kev and the line width @xmath79 kev  are in a good agreement with the results of @xcite , who also used the _ gabs _ model . using another suitable model _ cyclabs _ ( _ xspec _ ) : @xmath80 for the description of the cyclotron absorption line improves the fit even more to @xmath81 for 42 d.o.f .",
    "( fig.[fig : int_spec]c ) ; however the line energy is slightly lower in this fit ( @xmath82 kev ) , typical for a cyclotron absorption line that is approximated by _",
    "gabs _ or _ cyclabs _ models .     without ( _ b _ ) and with ( _ c _ ) a cyclotron absorption line ( see text for details ) .",
    "[ fig : int_spec ] ]    thus , the parameters of the best - fit model ( with the _ cyclabs _ component ) , describing the broadband spectrum of xpersei in the @xmath83 kev energy range are : photon index @xmath84 , cutoff energy @xmath85 kev , folding energy @xmath86 kev , line energy @xmath87 kev , line width @xmath88 kev , line depth @xmath89 .",
    "based on the measured value of the cyclotron line energy we can estimate the magnetic field on the neutron star surface as    @xmath90    depending on the model used ( _ gabs _ or _ cyclabs _ ) and using @xmath91 and @xmath92 km @xcite for the neutron star radius and mass estimates , respectively .",
    "we expect that at the low luminosity of @xmath93 erg s@xmath5 the accreted matter is falling down to the neutron star surface , where most of the energy is released and the cyclotron absorption line is formed ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , it is important to note that the cyclotron line in xpersei was found to be significantly broader than typically observed in x - ray pulsars @xcite . the unusual broadness may be explained by insufficient knowledge of spectral continuum in the broad energy band . in particular , approximation of the spectrum with other components",
    "can lead to the artificial deficit of photons in the region where the spectral components overlap ( see , e.g. , fig.8 in * ? ? ?",
    "* or current paper of doroshenko et al .",
    "this region roughly corresponds to the energy of the cyclotron line that can lead to the distortion of its parameters , particularly the width and depth of the line .",
    "-band ( top panel ) along with the _ asm / rxte _ light curve ( bottom panel ) . [ fig : optic_lc ] ]    since its discovery xpersei has been regularly observed in different wavebands .",
    "particularly , it was found that long - term fluctuations in the optical brightness ( @xmath94 ) are accompanied by the cyclic variability in the peak ratio of h@xmath95 and hei lines with periods varying between @xmath96 years ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the optical variability of the source is usually interpreted as a change of the mass content and distribution in the circumstellar disk due to the presence of one armed density wave .",
    "the lack of correlation between the strength of the line and continuum emission demonstrates that the disk variability involves a redistribution of material within the disk , leading to changes in the radial density gradient @xcite .    ]",
    "previous x - ray observations showed a number of cases when a rise of the optical brightness of the source was nt followed by a corresponding rise of the x - ray flux .",
    "this was explained by the truncation of the be star decretion disk by the tidally - driven eccentric instability ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "truncation at the 3:1 resonant radius produces a wide gap between the disc outer radius ( 0.47@xmath97 , @xmath97 is an orbital separation ) and the periastron distance ( 0.89 @xmath97 ) @xcite .",
    "this wide gap depress the accretion even at periastron , naturally leading to a low x - ray luminosity .",
    "in addition to this , @xcite report an episode of complete disc loss during the period 1988 may  1989 june .",
    "the time needed for the outer radius disk to reach the truncation radius was estimated to be about @xmath98 yr after the disc formation begins ( @xmath99 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter , * ? ? ?",
    "thus one can hardly expect any x - ray  optical correlation before the year 2000 .",
    "regular monitoring of the system by _",
    "asm / rxte _ since 1996 gives us a unique chance to test this hypothesis and to investigate the x - ray ",
    "optical dependance .",
    "fig.[fig : optic_lc ] shows the evolution of the system magnitude in @xmath25-band ( upper panel ) along with the x - ray evolution ( bottom panel ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the large variability of the source magnitude has only a weak reflection in the x - ray flux before 2002 , when the rise of the optical flux is followed by a major outburst in x - rays .",
    "given the discussion above , this rise in the x - ray flux can be interpreted as the interaction of the neutron star with the fully recovered disk .",
    "the maximum rise of the x - ray flux in 2003 is followed by a rapid decrease to the level still two times higher than the pre - outburst level , while the optical flux stays at a rather high level until a small drop in 2010 and a subsequent rise in 2011 .",
    "the drop of the x - ray flux in 2004 is probably related to the disruption of the outer layers of the disk , and the second rise of the x - ray flux is in good agreement with the estimated 5.7 years for the disk growth peiord @xcite .    in order to test qualitatively the correlation between optical and x - ray light curves with a possible non - zero time lag",
    ", we performed an interpolated correlation analysis using the improvements proposed by @xcite and @xcite . in order to increase the statistic we have binned",
    "_ asm / rxte _ data into 10 day bins . the resulting interpolated cross - correlation function ( icf )",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : crosscor ] .",
    "these data show a tentative correlation between x - rays and optical flux with a zero time lag ( with a correlation coefficient @xmath100 ) .",
    "the pronounced peaks at time lags of @xmath101 years are most probably artificial ones due to the internal _ asm / rxte _ one year periodicity related to the motion of earth around the sun @xcite and also the sampling of the optical observations after 2003 ( see fig.[fig : crosscor ] ) .",
    "these facts can also lead to the widening of the icf , thus despite the quite large correlation coefficient we prefer to call this correlation a tentative one .",
    "we presented here the comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the x - ray pulsar xpersei using data of the _ rxte _ , _ integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "the main results can be summarized as :     a strong outburst activity was detected from the source in soft and hard x - rays during 2001 - 2011 . during this period the source luminosity twice reached its maximum for the last @xmath54 years , @xmath1 ;     this activity was accompanied by drastic changes of the pulse period : a @xmath102-years period of the spin - down changed to spin - up with an average rate of @xmath41 yr@xmath5 , several times higher than previous rates of spin - up and spin - down ; moreover , this acceleration of the rotation of the neutron star is apparently not in steady state , but depends on the source flux ; the observed behaviour of the pulse period and its quantitative properties are naturally explained in terms of the current theory of the quasi - spherical accretion in low - luminosity x - ray pulsars @xcite ;     at the same time , no significant variability of the spectral parameters with the source flux was found during the rising part of the first outburst in 2001 - 2003 ; the source spectrum in the @xmath2 kev energy band can be well described by a combination of a thermal component ( with a temperature of @xmath103 kev ) and non - thermal component(powerlaw with the photon index of @xmath64 ) ;     using deep observations of the _ integral _ observatory we reconstructed a broadband spectrum of xpersei in the @xmath83 kev energy range and , for the first time , significantly detected hard x - ray emission from the source up to @xmath3 kev ;     a significant detection of the cyclotron absorption line in the source spectrum allowed us to estimate the magnetic field strength on the neutron star surface as @xmath104 depending on the model used ( _ gabs _ or _ cyclabs _ ) ; at the same time an insufficient knowledge of the spectrum continuum in the broad energy band can lead to distortion of the cyclotron line parameters ( particularly its width and depth may be affected ) ;     the observed variations of the x - ray flux are in good agreement with predictions of the viscous decretion disk of the be star @xcite , a quantitative study of the x - ray ",

    "<S> we present results of a comprehensive analysis of the x - ray pulsar xpersei over the period 1996 to 2011 , encompassing the quite low state and subsequent strong outburst activity . using data from the _ rxte _ and _ swift _ observatories we detected several consecutive outbursts , during which the source luminosity increased by a factor of @xmath0 up to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> previously the source was observed in a high state only once . </S>",
    "<S> the source spectrum in a standard energy band ( @xmath2 kev ) is independent of the flux change and can be described by a model that includes both thermal and non - thermal components . with the help of the _ integral _ observatory data we registered the highly significant cyclotron absorption line in the source spectrum and , for the first time , significantly detected a hard x - ray emission from the pulsar up to @xmath3 kev . </S>",
    "<S> we also report drastic changes of the pulse period during the outburst activity : a long episode of spin - down was changed to spin - up with a rate of @xmath4 yr@xmath5 , that is several times higher than previous rates of spin - up and spin - down . to search for a correlation between the x - ray and optical lightcurves we took data from the aavso international database . </S>",
    "<S> no significant correlation between optical and x - ray fluxes at any time lag from dozens of days to years was found .    </S>",
