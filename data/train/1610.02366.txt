    "bars are one of the most prominent morphological and evolutionary structures of spiral galaxies . their presence is quite ubiquitous , with recent observational data consistently establishing a bar fraction somewhere between 30% and 60% in the local universe @xcite and a slightly lesser value at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "bars create a strong torque on the galaxy @xcite leading to a redistribution of the gaseous and stellar component @xcite and a transport of angular momentum from the inner to the outer regions of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these dynamical effects have a wide range of consequences on both the gaseous and stellar content of the galaxy : the central bulge - like stellar component gets heated up @xcite , while gas flows from the outer to the inner regions of the galaxy @xcite . as a result , the radial chemical abundance profile initially flattens @xcite , and the concentration of gas in the centre of the galaxy increases @xcite .",
    "the accumulation of gas in the centre eventually triggers an increase in the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that this enhanced star formation activity increases the metallicity of the gas in the central region @xcite , thus explaining the origin of the observed break in the slope of the chemical abundance profiles of barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal the importance of the bar in the secular evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "although the general overview of the impact of a bar on a galactic disc is well accepted , the details of the process , and its dependence on galactic properties , pose many remaining questions . while the presence of a bar often causes an increase of the sfr",
    ", several observations show no increase @xcite or an increase only in early - type spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent work with the volunteer - based identification of morphological types by the galaxy zoo team showed that the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) is anti - correlated with the presence of a bar @xcite but at same time the relation between the sfr and the stellar mass @xmath2 seems unaffected by the presence of a bar @xcite .",
    "this matter is further complicated by bar strength and length : early - type spirals tend to have stronger bars @xcite , longer bars are redder and situated in redder galaxies @xcite , and bar length is correlated with stellar mass , srsic index , and central surface star density @xcite , all of which affect the sfr , though some studies found only marginally higher star formation efficiencies in galaxies with strong bars @xcite . the sfr of barred galaxies has also been shown to correlate with the central gas mass @xcite , and the increase in sfr , or lack thereof , in barred galaxies could be due to a temporarily pre- or post - starburst phase @xcite . a very recent study by @xcite shows that higher sfrs in the central kpc of barred galaxies are not caused by larger central gas supplies , but instead by much higher star formation efficiencies compared to unbarred galaxies , in contradiction with earlier results by @xcite .",
    "metallicities and gas content have also yielded conflicting results , with wide variations in radial abundance profiles in both gas @xcite and stars @xcite .",
    "comparison between barred and unbarred galaxies show that the former can have higher central metallicities @xcite , no significant variations @xcite , or even lower metallicities than the latter @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that bars are more common in gas - poor galaxies , but it is unclear if this is due to sfr - related gas exhaustion triggered by the bar , by lower bar formation in gas - rich galaxies or if both gas fraction and bar formation are correlated to environmental effects @xcite .",
    "the observational results described above indicate that the effect of a bar on the re - distribution of gas and metals , and subsequent star formation , is a highly complex process that proceeds differently in different galaxies .",
    "the mass of the host galaxy , its morphological type , its gas fraction , the strength and length of the bar , and the presence of an agn are all important factors which can potentially impact the local and global star formation history , the radial migration of stars , the gas enrichment and its flows . in previous work ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) we simulated a barred galaxy with a mass comparable to that of the milky way , and showed that the presence of the bar causes an important enhancement of the metallicity of gas situated within the _ central region _ , defined as a sphere with radius of @xmath3 .",
    "we also showed that this enhancement could not be solely attributed to the local star formation in the central region , but that 50% of these metals originated from a different location and flowed toward the centre along the bar .    in the current paper , we extend the work of paper  i by simulating a suite of barred and unbarred galaxies with a range of stellar masses and gas fractions .",
    "this work is particularly motivated by the observational result of @xcite that the sfrs of barred galaxies are enhanced only for galaxies with @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the stellar mass .",
    "in contrast , the metallicity enhancement measured by @xcite is seen at all stellar masses .",
    "the disparity between the central metallicity and the sfr was believed to be due to a fast , starburst - like formation episode in low - mass galaxies while high - mass galaxies retained a high sfr through their evolution . in order to provide a theoretical comparison with the results of @xcite",
    ", we simulate isolated barred and unbarred galaxies of various stellar masses between @xmath5 and 10.4 and study the variation as a function of mass of the sfr and gas flows along the bar of both barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "we present our simulation code and our suite of simulations in section  [ sec : cgcp ] .",
    "results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "summary and conclusion are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "all the simulations in this paper were performed using the numerical algorithm gcd+ @xcite .",
    "gcd+ is a three - dimensional tree / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm @xcite which simulates the galactic chemodynamical evolution , accounting for hydrodynamics , self - gravitation , star formation , supernovae feedback , metal enrichment and diffusion , and radiative cooling .",
    "it uses an artificial thermal conductivity suggested by @xcite to resolve the kelvin - helmholtz instability , and the adaptive softening length suggested by @xcite .",
    "metal diffusion is computed using the method of @xcite , while radiative cooling and heating are handled using tables computed with cloudy @xcite .",
    "star formation is handled by transforming gas particles into star particles as described in @xcite : if the local velocity of the gas particle is convergent and the density exceeds a given density threshold @xmath6 , the gas particle may transform into a star particle with a probability weighted by its density .",
    "the star particles are assumed to consist of stars whose mass follow a @xcite initial mass function and the metal enrichment they produce from type  ii and ia supernovae is calculated from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "four main parameters govern the star formation rate and the supernovae feedback @xcite and are fixed as follows : the supernovae energy output @xmath7 , the stellar wind energy output @xmath8 , the star formation efficiency @xmath9 , and the star formation density threshold @xmath10 .      for generating the initial conditions of our simulations",
    ", we use the same technique as in @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a dark matter halo which is treated analytically , and a disc made of gas and stars , which are represented by stellar and gaseous particles .",
    "we do not include a central bulge in the initial conditions .",
    "we set up the stellar particle disc using an exponential surface density profile : @xmath11    where @xmath2 is the stellar disc mass , @xmath12 its scale length , and @xmath13 the scale height , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radial and vertical coordinates , respectively .",
    "the gaseous disc has the same radial exponential surface density , but its height is determined by imposing an initial hydrostatic equilibrium within the gaseous disc .",
    "we then set an initial radial metallicity profile in both the stellar and gaseous populations , with the iron abundance being given by @xmath16}= 0.2 -0.05r,\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is in kpc .",
    "@xmath17elements are initially only present in the stellar component and their abundance is given by @xmath18= -0.16[fe / h]}(r).\\ ] ]    we modify the metallicity of each particle by adding a gaussian scatter of @xmath19 to create a local dispersion of their abundances .",
    "the star particles are assigned an initial age using an age - metallicity relation @xmath20=-0.04\\times\\,age(gyr)$ ] . as in paper",
    "i , we do not simulate the evolution of the dark matter halo .",
    "instead , we assume a static halo with an nfw profile @xcite , which is appropriate for simulations of isolated galaxies .",
    "as we vary the mass of the stellar component of the galaxy , we must adapt all of the other parameters , such as the size of the stellar disc and the mass and size of the gaseous and dark matter components , to follow the expected behaviour .",
    "following @xcite , we derive the values of all these parameters using observational or simulated relations between one parameter and the other , thus obtaining an `` average '' galaxy of a given stellar mass .",
    "we first derive the mass of the nfw halo using the results from @xcite , who obtained a parametrisation of the ratio between dark matter halo mass and the stellar mass within the halo using abundance matching analysis .",
    "this parametrisation takes the form : @xmath21^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the halo mass , @xmath23 is a normalisation factor , @xmath24 the transition mass between an evolution as a power of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we use @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 as suggested by the best fit in @xcite . instead of attributing directly a scale length to the nfw halo",
    ", we fix the concentration parameter @xmath31 to 8 in barred galaxies and 20 in unbarred galaxies .",
    "as shown in @xcite and paper  i , a high concentration parameter stabilizes the simulated disc , preventing the formation of the otherwise naturally - occurring bar .",
    "we use the halo mass and scale length to calculate a fixed gravitational potential which will act on star and gas particles through the simulation . by forgoing the dynamical nature of the dark matter halo",
    "we can greatly increase our baryonic resolution for a given computational time while having little impact on star formation and gas evolution .",
    "the value of the concentration parameter , and the presence of a live dark matter halo , have been shown to influence the rotation speed , size , morphology , and stability of the bar during its evolution @xcite .",
    "however , their influence are prominent in the long - term evolution of the host galaxy ( e.g. over a hubble time ) , while we focus here on the shorter - term , initial effect of the bar on the star formation history , i.e. @xmath0 after bar formation .",
    "long - term evolution will be considered in future work .",
    "the scale radius of the stellar disc is calculated using the relation between @xmath32 , the half - light radius , and @xmath2 , the mass of the stellar disc , as found by @xcite : @xmath33    where @xmath26 is a scaling factor , @xmath34 is the characteristic mass of the transition between the relation for lower - mass galaxies and that for higher - mass galaxies .",
    "we use @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 to evaluate the half - light radius for a given mass . assuming that the half - light radius corresponds roughly with the half - mass radius , we integrate the density profile of the stellar disc ( eq . [ eq : stellardisk ] ) up to @xmath32 to obtain a transcendental relation between @xmath12 and @xmath32 which lets us compute the scale - radius from the disc mass .",
    "finally , we set the values of the parameters for the gaseous disc using the same relation as @xcite , @xmath39    where both masses are expressed in @xmath40 units . since this relation has a non - zero initial value , the gas fraction of the galaxies will vary with stellar mass , with low - mass galaxies having a higher gas fraction than high - mass ones . as for the gaseous disc scale length ,",
    "it is fixed at twice the scale length of the corresponding stellar disc .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : newruns ]        in this study , we purposely used a larger number of particles to simulate more massive galaxies ( see table  [ table : initial ] ) , in order to maintain a fixed physical resolution across the ensemble of simulations .",
    "in all simulations , the particle mass is of order @xmath41 .",
    "if we had used instead the same number of particles in all simulations , the low - mass galaxies would have a much higher physical resolution than the high - mass ones .",
    "this could lead to potential problems if some physical phenomena only appear below a certain mass scale .",
    "these phenomena could be resolved in the low - mass galaxies , but not in the high - mass ones .",
    "also , the subgrid model of star formation and feedback used in gcd+ is known to be sensitive to physical mass resolution @xcite .",
    "having different physical resolutions from run to run might require an adjustment of the subgrid parameters .",
    "we performed two additional simulations of barred galaxies , od and hd , to illustrate the effects of varying the physical resolution .",
    "table  [ table : newruns ] lists the initial parameters of these new galaxies , along with the ones of galaxies  o , d , and  h. the seventh column shows the total number of particles @xmath42 .",
    "galaxy od has the same mass as galaxy o , but the same total number of particles as galaxy d. similarly , galaxy hd has the same mass as galaxy h , but the same total number of particles as galaxy d.    the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : d_gals ] shows the evolution of the bar strength for these runs .",
    "galaxy o does not form a significant bar .",
    "all other galaxies form a bar , and though the values of @xmath43 strongly fluctuate with time , the mean values remain around @xmath44 after @xmath45 .",
    "galaxies o has fewer particles than all the other galaxies , which suggests that there is a minimum number of particles required to resolve the formation of the bar . when the bar is resolved , its strength is independent of the number of particles used . in particular , the evolution of @xmath43 for galaxies h and",
    "hd is essentially the same , even though galaxy h has 2.5 times more particles .",
    "the upper and middle panels of figure  [ fig : d_gals ] show the evolution of the central sfr and central hydrogen mass with time , and reveal important differences between the various runs .",
    "the sfr is significantly higher in galaxy od than in galaxy o. this could be explained by the fact that galaxy o simply failed to form a bar that would drive gas inward .",
    "however , galaxy o contains three times as much central gas as galaxy od at the end of the simulation , indicating that galaxy od is much more efficient in converting gas into stars . comparing galaxies h and hd ,",
    "we see the opposite effect : galaxy hd has a lower sfr than galaxy h , and is less efficient in converting central gas into stars .",
    "this can not be explained by a bar effect , since their bars have the same strength .",
    "galaxy hd is essentially a version of galaxy h with lower physical resolution ( mass per particle : @xmath46 instead of @xmath41 ) . lowering the mass resolution increases the minimum mass of gas clumps that can form by fragmentation .",
    "these more massive clumps can not reach density as high as in galaxy h , and as a result star formation is less efficient .",
    "the sfr peak is significantly lower , and is reached later .",
    "galaxies od and o show the opposite effect . in this case",
    ", the new galaxy od has a higher physical resolution than galaxy o ( mass per particle : @xmath47 instead of @xmath41 ) .",
    "this leads to more fragmentation , smaller , denser gas clumps , and more star formation .",
    "the sfr peak for galaxy od is about @xmath48 higher than the one for galaxy o.    these comparisons show that the physical mass per particle has a major impact on the outcome of the simulations .",
    "this vindicates our decision to keep it uniform across the entire set of simulations .",
    "we have conducted a numerical study of the star formation history in barred and unbarred spiral galaxies , focussing on the dependence on the total stellar mass @xmath2 .",
    "we considered barred galaxies with masses ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , and for each barred galaxy , we simulated an unbarred galaxy of the same mass to provide a comparison sample .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   barred and unbarred galaxies evolve very differently .",
    "the bar drives a large amount of gas into the central region .",
    "this enhances the central sfr of barred galaxies compared to unbarred galaxies with the same total mass .",
    "the highest - mass barred galaxies consequently experience a starburst , with the sfr increasing by a factor up to 30 in the central @xmath51 region relative to an unbarred galaxy of the same stellar mass .",
    "2 .   in barred galaxies ,",
    "most of the gas driven into the central region by the bar eventually ends up being consumed by the star formation process . in massive barred galaxies ,",
    "the strength of the starburst more than compensates for the fact that more gas is funnelled toward the centre , so more massive galaxies end up with a lower central gas concentration ( see bottom panel of fig  [ fig : mhf2 ] ) .",
    "in unbarred galaxies , the lower sfr allows gas to accumulate in the central @xmath51 region . as a result",
    ", unbarred galaxies are expected to have a larger central gas concentration than barred galaxies above a certain stellar mass @xmath2 , and our results suggests that the difference should increase with @xmath2 , as more massive barred galaxies experience stronger starbursts ( see bottom panel of fig  [ fig : delta_h ] ) .",
    "3 .   bars drive a substantial amount of gas toward the centre of barred galaxies , but a high efficiency enables star formation to keep up with the build - up of gas in the central region . as a result , barred galaxies at late time tend to have lower central gas content and higher sfr than unbarred galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "we find that the initial gas mass is the main driver of the evolution of barred galaxies .",
    "we considered galaxies with different gas fraction , and found that galaxies with comparable initial gas masses had similar evolutions , even though their virial and baryonic masses were different .",
    "our simulated results broadly reproduce the observational results of @xcite . comparing our fig .",
    "[ fig : same_fiber_young ] with the bottom panel of their fig .  3",
    ", we see in the simulations and in the observations an increase of 0.2 dex in @xmath52 taking place at a total stellar mass @xmath53 .",
    "overall , the simulated values are 0.3 dex higher than the observed values , going from 0.3 to 0.5 instead of 0.0 to 0.2 .",
    "but it is quite remarkable that the simulations reproduce both the amplitude and location of the jump in @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite suggested that star formation in barred galaxies is short - lived below a total stellar mass @xmath54 , and ongoing above that mass .",
    "our simulations suggest an alternative explanation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sfrf ] ) : the sfr in high - mass barred galaxies sharply increases , reaches a peak , and then slowly decays , while the variations in sfr are less important in low - mass galaxies .",
    "the enhancement in sfr at high - mass found in @xcite is not caused by the sfr of individual galaxies .",
    "instead , it is the process of averaging over galaxies that have different masses and are at different evolutionary stages , but happen to have the same central stellar mass , that causes this enhancement . as the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrfm ] shows , at large central stellar masses ( @xmath55 ) , we are essentially averaging over high - mass galaxies which are in the peak of their sfr , thus explaining the large enhancement in sfr compared to unbarred galaxies . at lower central stellar masses",
    ", we are combining lower - mass galaxies , with a correspondingly lower sfr peak , with high - mass galaxies that are at an early evolutionary stage and have not yet reached their sfr peak .    an important lesson to be learned from this study",
    "is that one must be careful when comparing galaxies that share one common observable property , such as the central stellar mass .",
    "galaxies with a same central stellar mass can have completely different total masses , and be at very different stages of their respective evolution .",
    "it is preferable to compare galaxies that share at least two observable properties , such as gas fraction , but even that might not be sufficient .",
    "the various curves in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrfm ] intersect .",
    "hence , two galaxies with both the same central stellar mass and the same sfr can be very different . if the simulation of barred galaxy o was extended slightly beyond @xmath56 , the violet and yellow curves would intersect .",
    "we would then have two barred galaxies differing by a factor of 4 in total mass , having the same central stellar mass and the same central sfr .",
    "we have only considered isolated galaxies . in reality",
    ", galaxies can accrete a substantial amount of matter from the intergalactic medium , and merge with other galaxies .",
    "this could affect the dynamics of the bar , and also affect the post - starburst evolution of barred galaxies , by replenishing the supply of gas depleted by star formation , although @xcite find that the atomic gas fraction ( relative to the stellar mass ) of merging galaxies is little changed during interactions .",
    "using multi - zoom cosmological simulations , @xcite previously studied the mass assembly of galaxies in a cosmological context , in order to quantify the respective role played by mergers and accretion .",
    "these simulations reveal that the mass assembly history can vary wildly from one galaxy to another . in their section",
    "5 , they present four characteristic galaxies , and interestingly their galaxy b ) resembles ours : the total baryonic mass increases until redshift @xmath57 , then remains constant for the next @xmath58 as the gas mass decreases because of star formation ( see top right panel of their fig .",
    "14 ) . in the last @xmath58 of its evolution",
    ", their galaxy b ) essentially evolves in isolation , just like ours ( and for the same period of time as well ) .",
    "hence , our simulations are most relevant to low - redshift galaxies , when most of the mass assembly is completed . including the effects of accretion and mergers in our simulations",
    "is clearly the next step in this program , and results will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
