    "some works on the normal thermodynamics of black holes shows that in many cases , one can not identify the detailed reasons irregularities of mass , temperature and heat capacity shown by the system . during the last few decades",

    "hermann  @xcite defined the implication of thermodynamic phase space as a differential manifold with a natural contact structure , in which there exist a special subspace of thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "weinhold introduced an other geometric method in 1975  @xcite , in which a metric is defined in the space of equilibrium states of thermodynamic systems .",
    "weinhold used the notion of conformal mapping from the riemannian space to thermodynamic space . weinhold s metric",
    "is defined as the hessian in the mass representation as follows @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass , @xmath3 is the entropy and @xmath4 is the other extensive variables of the system .",
