    "it is not uncommon , in physics , that certain problems suddenly arise to a revived interest , after having been studied , and at least partially solved , in a distant past and henceforth disregarded .",
    "a bright example of such a revival is given by bloch oscillations of a quantum particle in a periodic potential .",
    "predicted by bloch and zener around 1930 for electrons in a solid crystal subject to an electric field @xcite , this phenomenon has been experimentally detected only sixty years later in semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "however , only after its observation via cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite and via light in photonic crystals @xcite new research in this direction blossomed .",
    "currently , the field of bloch oscillations of cold atoms is very diverse , including phenomena like super bloch oscillations @xcite and new applications , like precision measurement of gravity @xcite , and more : in this review we elect to limit our citations to a few seminal and typical papers , out of an impressive total list .    during this revival , experimental achievements has gone hand by hand with progress in the theory of wannier - stark states , _",
    "i.e. _ the eigenstates of a quantum particle in a tilted lattice , that are the spectral counterpart of bloch oscillations .",
    "new analytical methods have been developed , which allow one to calculate wannier - stark states for arbitrary values of the system parameters @xcite .",
    "this review is particularly focused on spectral theory : in this respect wannier - stark states constitute the second item in the list of the four fundamental quantum states in the problem of a particle in a lattice  the first place being obviously occupied by bloch waves .",
    "the third element in this list are landau states .",
    "originally , the term was meant to indicate the eigenstates of a charged particle , in free space , subject to a magnetic field .",
    "however , it is nowadays also used to denote the eigenstates in the presence of an additional periodic potential .",
    "the combined action of the magnetic field and the periodic potential yields the extremely rich physics of landau states , which is reflected in the notions of magnetic bands @xcite , hofstadter s butterfly @xcite , topological invariants @xcite , edge states @xcite , _ et cetera_. recently , following a number of theoretical suggestions @xcite , experimentalists have been able to simulate magnetic fields acting on _ neutral _ atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "precisely , the physical systems so constructed are described by a tight - binding hamiltonian , formally identical to that of a charged particle in a lattice , subject to a magnetic field .",
    "this achievement opens wide prospects for experimental studies of landau states and related phenomena .",
    "the fourth kind of fundamental states is related to the case of a quantum particle in the hall configuration .",
    "this is defined by a two - dimensional lattice , an in - plane ( real or synthetic ) electric field , and a normal to the lattice plane ( real or synthetic ) magnetic field .",
    "it will be shown in the subsequent sections that the eigenstates of a quantum particle in the hall configuration share some features with wannier - stark states .",
    "for this reason we call them _ landau - stark _ states and the associated dynamical problem _ cyclotron - bloch oscillations_. some aspects of landau - stark states and cyclotron - bloch oscillations have been addressed earlier @xcite . having been written in the period before revival , these papers did not attract the deserved attention .",
    "in addition , they were lacking a systematic approach .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that in the laboratory the hall configuration was exclusively realized by solid state systems , where the electric field can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "this is definitely not the case for the new experimental systems based on cold atoms and photonic crystals , that require a complete approach , in which electric and magnetic fields ( more generally , potential and gauge fields ) are treated on equal footing from the very beginning .",
    "the aim of the present review , which is largely based on recent works @xcite , is to fill gaps in the theory of landau - stark states and cyclotron - bloch oscillations , by systematically considering the system in all regions of its parameter space .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ seca ] we introduce our main model  the tight - binding hamiltonian of a quantum particle in the hall configuration . in this hamiltonian the magnetic field",
    "is characterized by the peierls phase @xmath0 , the electric field by its magnitude @xmath1 and orientation @xmath2 .",
    "we then recall the main properties of this system : for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , wannier - stark states are introduced ; the case @xmath5 , @xmath6 , yields landau states ; finally , when @xmath5 , @xmath4 we describe the important construction of landau - stark states .",
    "global properties of these states are discussed in sec .",
    "[ seca4 ] .",
    "we show that , unlike the case of landau states , where rationality of the peierls phase @xmath0 plays the crucial role , the structure of landau - stark states is principally determined by the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "namely , for rational @xmath7 landau - stark states are extended functions with continuous spectrum , while for irrational @xmath7 they are localized states with discrete spectrum .    extended and localized landau - stark states and their spectra",
    "are further discussed in sec .",
    "[ secb ] and sec .",
    "[ secc ] , where we focus on two limiting values of the peierls phase : @xmath8 , in sec .",
    "[ secb ] , and @xmath9 , in sec .",
    "[ secc ] . to the interval @xmath10 without any loss of generality . ] in sec .",
    "[ secb ] we also analyze the case of a _ staggered _ magnetic field , which provides a relatively easy experimental realization of the hall configuration with cold atoms @xcite .",
    "important results of these sections are the estimates of the localization length of landau - stark states for irrational @xmath7 in different situations .",
    "in particular , for @xmath11 , the localization length is shown to diverge exponentially , when the electric field decreases below a critical value .",
    "the next two sections of the review are devoted to the analysis of two difficult problems of mathematical and physical relevance , that broaden the scope of the investigation and more closely address real experimental situations . in sec .",
    "[ secd ] we consider finite systems , with specified boundary conditions , while in sec .",
    "[ sece ] we study infinite lattices , beyond the single - band approximation .",
    "finite systems can show features , like edge states , that do not appear in infinite systems .",
    "we analyze two types of boundary conditions : harmonic confinement , which is the default boundary condition for cold atoms in optical lattices , and dirichlet boundary conditions , which are realized in photonic and solid state crystals .",
    "the analysis of the system beyond the single - band approximation is aimed to answer the fundamental question whether landau - stark states are in fact metastable states , _",
    "i.e. _ , quantum resonances , as it is known to be the case of wannier - stark states .",
    "we finally end the review by listing open problems in the concluding sec .",
    "[ secee ] .    before proceeding with the main part we find useful to list the abbreviations used in the text .",
    "these are : @xmath12 1d : one - dimensional @xmath12 2d : two - dimensional @xmath12 ws - states : wannier - stark states @xmath12 bos : bloch oscilllations @xmath12 ls - states : landau - stark states @xmath12 lz - tunneling : landau - zener tunneling @xmath12 bc : boundary condition .",
    "in this section we introduce the physical model under investigation .",
    "although the theory is applicable to different physical systems , we shall use the standard terminology of solid state physics .",
    "let us therefore consider a quantum particle of mass @xmath13 and charge @xmath14 , moving in a 2d square lattice of side @xmath15 in the @xmath16 plane , created by a periodic potential @xmath17 .",
    "the particle is also under the action of an electric and a magnetic field .",
    "the former lies in the @xmath16 plane , while the latter is normal to it .",
    "this particle is described by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vector potential of the magnetic field @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the electric field .",
    "standard choices of the vector potential are @xmath22 or @xmath23 , known as the landau gauge , and @xmath24 , known as the symmetric gauge .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the system ( [ b1 ] ) is a difficult , unsolved problem .",
    "therefore , one deals with this problem by introducing suitable approximations , among which the most common is the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the starting point of the tight - binding approximation is the bloch spectrum of the quantum particle when @xmath20 and @xmath1 are null .",
    "this spectrum consists of the ground energy band , @xmath25 , separated by a finite gap @xmath26 from higher energy bands , that may overlap . using the bloch states associated with the ground band ,",
    "one constructs the localized wannier functions @xmath27 , where the indexes @xmath28 and @xmath29 label the local wells of the periodic potential . since wannier functions are related to each other by elementary translations , @xmath30 ,",
    "the single function @xmath31 is sufficient to construct all of them . on these premises",
    "the single - band approximation amounts to the following ansatz for the wave function , @xmath32 we thus truncate the hilbert space of the system to the subspace spanned by the wannier functions @xmath27 . we shall discuss the validity of this approximation in some detail later on , in sec .",
    "[ sece ] .",
    "once wannier functions have been determined , we can calculate the matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ b1 ] ) in their basis : @xmath33 . if the potential @xmath34 is deep enough ( and , hence , wannier functions are well localized within one well ) we may neglect matrix elements with @xmath35 and @xmath36 . after some elementary algebra we obtain : @xmath37 where we used the landau gauge @xmath22 and we omitted a constant term in the energy of wannier states .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 in this hamiltonian is the famous peierls phase , @xmath38 which physically corresponds to the magnetic flux through the elementary cell , in units of the flux quantum @xmath39 .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) will be our model in the main part of this review .",
    "then , without any loss of generality , we can restrict the value of the parameter @xmath0 to the interval @xmath40 .",
    "two characteristic frequencies determine the dynamics of the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) .",
    "they can be determined by alternatively letting @xmath20 and @xmath1 to be null .",
    "firstly , consider the case @xmath6 . within the tight - binding approximation ,",
    "the ground bloch band is approximated by the cosine dispersion relation @xmath41 thus , the hopping matrix elements @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) are related to the effective mass of the particle , @xmath44 , via @xmath45 . using the notion of effective mass",
    "we can introduce the cyclotron frequency @xmath46 .",
    "next , expressing the magnetic field @xmath20 through the peierls phase @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ b4 ] ) and the effective masses @xmath47 through the hopping matrix elements @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we can also write @xmath48 secondly , let @xmath49 , to define the other characteristic frequency of the system , the bloch frequency @xmath50 : @xmath51 that characterizes the so  called bloch oscillations experienced by a particle when the electric field is switched on . observe that we can also define two different frequencies , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one for each of the spatial directions .",
    "generally , when both fields are present , one expects qualitatively different dynamics of the system ( [ b3 ] ) depending on relative size of cyclotron and bloch frequencies . in what follows , to simplify equations , we set the charge @xmath14 , the lattice period @xmath15 and all fundamental constants to unity .",
    "in so doing , the bloch frequencies are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 . also , if not stated otherwise , we also set @xmath56 , which means that energy is measured in units of the hopping energy @xmath57 and time in units of the tunneling period @xmath58 .",
    "let us now describe the two limiting cases of null magnetic and electric field , starting from the former .      for vanishing magnetic field , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] )",
    "are the localized ws - states @xmath59 , for integer @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whose spectrum is given by the sum of two wannier - stark ladders , @xmath62 one can easily prove eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and find the explicit form of ws - states by noticing that for @xmath3 the hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) is separable and , hence , the 2d eigenvalue problem reduces to two independent 1d problems : one in the @xmath63 direction , @xmath64 and a fully similar one for the second degree of freedom .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) can be expressed in terms of bessel functions @xmath65 of the first kind , of argument @xmath66 .",
    "this can be seen in a variety of ways .",

    "( [ c1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) do not apply to the case where either @xmath54 or @xmath55 are null .",

    "we can predict the dynamics of an initially localized wave packet in the @xmath16 plane . in the general case ,",
    "@xmath79 , the motion is a superposition of harmonic 1d bloch oscillations . as a result , a coherent wave packet follows a lissajous - like trajectory @xcite .",
    "observe again that , in the case when one field component is null , say @xmath75 , the packet oscillates in the @xmath80 direction and spreads ballistically in the @xmath80 direction .",
    "a second , specific yet important initial condition is the bloch wave @xmath81 that is characterized by the quasimomentum @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , in this case one can only speak of oscillations of the expectation value of the velocity . to describe these oscillations , it is convenient to move from the wannier - stark to the bloch picture .",

    "we shall consider the projection of the mean velocity on the direction of the electric field , @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the velocity operators .",
    "these operators should not be confused with the momentum operators .",

    "for the operator @xmath92 one has similar expressions . ]",
    "using the solution ( [ c6b ] ) , it is easy to prove that the projection oscillates as @xmath93 where the prime denotes the first derivative of the dispersion relation along the line @xmath94 .",
    "the dynamics of bloch oscillations becomes much richer if we break separability of the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "this can be done , for example , by introducing checkerboard onsite energies : @xmath95 .",
    "this problem was considered in @xcite .",
    "the on - site potential doubles the lattice period and splits the bloch band ( [ b5 ] ) into two subbands @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "( [ c8 ] ) the quasimomenta @xmath99 and @xmath100 refer to the coordinate system defined by the primary axes of the double - periodic lattice , which are rotated by @xmath101 with respect to the primary axes of the simple square lattice .",
    "as soon as the bloch band is split into subbands a new effect comes into play : interband lz - tunneling . to take lz - tunneling into account , eq .",
    "( [ c6b ] ) must be modified as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the complex amplitudes of the lower and upper subband , respectively .",
    "recently , lz - tunneling has been intensively studied in 1d double - periodic lattices @xcite .",
    "when moving to 2d systems , a crucial difference appears : the dynamics of lz - tunneling not only depends on the field electric magnitude @xmath1 , but also on its orientation , relative to the primary axes of the lattice .",
    "we shall discuss this orientation effect in detail in sec .",
    "[ secb ] , when considering the case of @xmath105-flux , where the particle dispersion relation also consists of two subbands .",
    "the complex landau - zener dynamics of double - periodic lattices ( or , more generally , lattices with two sublattices ) is reflected in the complicated structure of ws - states and of their spectrum .",
    "this problem was considered in @xcite : it was found that ws - states are localized for ` irrational ' directions of the electric field , but extended for ` rational ' directions , defined by the straight lines connecting any two sites of the lattice . in a lattice with square symmetry",
    "the last conditions means that @xmath106 is a rational number . anticipating results to be detailed later ,",
    "let us mention that the landau - stark states ( @xmath5 ) are also extended or localized , depending on the rationality of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this is just one of the many similarities existing between lattices with non - trivial geometry and the square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "when the electric field is null , @xmath6 , the key notion of the theory is that of magnetic bands . we discuss this notion within the framework of the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ b3 ] ) , although it has a more general meaning , that can be applied to the original hamiltonian ( [ b1 ] ) as well , see @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that a non - zero peierls phase breaks separability of the 2d hamiltonian and , hence , the single bloch band ( [ b5 ] ) splits into subbands  known as magnetic bands . to find these bands",
    "one uses a formal substitution in which the wave function is a plane wave in the @xmath80 direction the substitution must rather be a plane wave in the @xmath63 direction .",

    "( [ d1 ] ) one assumes periodic boundary conditions , of period @xmath108 , that in a successive step tends to infinity .",
    "the substitution ( [ d1 ] ) results in the celebrated harper equation of @xcite , @xmath109 which is parametrized by the quasimomentum @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a rational number , @xmath110 , we can apply bloch theorem to eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) , thereby introducing the quasimomentum @xmath99 , defined in the reduced brillouin zone , @xmath111 .",

    "we describe a fundamental property of ls - states that is valid for arbitrary @xmath0 , whether large or small , rational or irrational .",
    "this property is the sensitivity of the spectrum to the orientation of the electric field , relative to the primary axes of the lattice .",

    "<S> recent experimental progress in the creation of synthetic electric and magnetic fields , acting on cold atoms in a two - dimensional lattice , has attracted renewed interest to the problem of a quantum particle in the hall configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the present work contains a detailed analysis of the eigenstates of this system , called landau - stark states , and of the associated dynamical phenomenon of cyclotron - bloch oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that landau - stark states and cyclotron - bloch oscillations crucially depend on two factors . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the orientation of the electric field relative to the primary axes of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the second is ratio between the frequencies of bloch and cyclotron oscillations , that is also the ratio between the magnitudes of electric and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is first carried out in the tight - binding approximation , where the magnetic field is characterized by the peierls phase entering the hopping matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> agreement of this analysis with the full quantum theory is also studied . </S>"
