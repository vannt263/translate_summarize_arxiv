    "the cr - driven dynamo model consists of the following elements ( based on hanasz et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) : ( 1 ) the cosmic ray component is an relativistic gas described by diffusion - advection transport equation ; ( 2 ) anisotropic diffusion of cr along magnetic field lines ; ( 3 ) localized sources of cr : random explosions of supernova remnants in the disk volume , which supply the cr energy density ; ( 4 ) uniform resistivity of ism ; ( 5 ) shearing boundary conditions and tidal forces are implemented to reproduce the differentially rotating disk in the local approximation ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 ) ; ( 6 ) realistic vertical disk gravity following the model of milky way ( ferrire 1998 ) with scaled contribution of disk and halo to irregular galaxies .",

    "we perform a two series of numerical experiments for different values of angular velocity @xmath2 and shearing parameter @xmath3 ( see caption of fig . [ rys1 ] ) . in experiments",
    "a1a5 we found that the efficiency of magnetic field amplification depends strongly on the angular velocity ( fig .",

    "to estimate the total production rate of magnetic field energy during simulation time , we calculate the outflowing magnetic energy density through the @xmath8 top and bottom domain boundaries .",
    "our results show that large amounts of magnetic energy are lost through the open boundaries of the computational box , suggesting that irregular galaxies due to their weaker gravitation can be efficient sources of intergalactic magnetic fields .",
