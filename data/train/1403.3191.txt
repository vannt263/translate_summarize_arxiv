    "random walks @xcite have played a key role in statistical physics for over a century .",
    "they were proposed to stochastically formulate transport phenomena and macroscopic diffusion observables were calculated in long - time and short - distance limits of them @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the key quantity characterizing the random walks or diffusion phenomena , the mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath8 , grows linearly with time .",
    "however , hurst found the persistence of hydrologic time series indicating that the msd behaves in nonlinear way @xcite and in recent , such phenomena have been observed in many different systems such as chaotic @xcite , biophysical @xcite , economic systems@xcite , and etc .",
    "the nonlinear behavior is recognized as anomalous diffusions compared with the linear behavior that is regarded as normal diffusion , and is characterized in terms of the msd x^2 ( t ) ~t^2h . [ 2h ] here @xmath9 means average over independent realizations , i.e. , ensemble average , in general , in non - equilibrium .",
    "@xmath0 is called as the anomalous diffusion or the hurst exponent which classifies superdiffusion ( @xmath10 ) in which the past and future random variables are positively correlated and thus persistence is exhibited , and subdiffusion ( @xmath11 ) which behaves in the opposite way , showing antipersistence .",
    "the hurst exponent however , does not provide any informations on underlying physical mechanism of anomalous diffusion , and so a variety of models to describe the mechanism have been proposed @xcite but they do not give any a universal mechanism but rather suggest very distinct origins , separately .",
    "the representative models among them are the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite , the lvy flights @xcite , and the continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite . in the fbm , long - ranged temporal correlations between steps is given so that msd scales like eq .",
    "( [ 2h ] ) within the range of @xmath12 , and thus fbm describes both subdiffusion and superdiffusion however , its correlation is mathematically constructed and it shows stationary behaviors unlike nonstationary nature shown in real experiments and systems .",
    "meanwhile other two models mimic further specific systems and describe only one region of anomalous diffusions , respectively . in lvy flights ,",
    "step - length distribution follows the power - law asymptotic behavior , so that the average distance per a step is infinite , which invokes superdiffusions . in ctrw model",
    "a time interval between two consecutive steps is a continuous random variable which is drawn according to the waiting time distribution ( wtd ) . for the wtd possessing the finite average of waiting time",
    "the msd is linearly dependent on time , that is , the normal diffusive behavior is shown , while for the cases where the wtd behaves asymptotically as power - laws and thus possesses infinite average of waiting time , subdiffusive behaviors are induced . also ctrw and lvy walks have been generalized to reflect more physical realities by considering coupled space - time memory or various correlations between steps @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", a microscopic non - markovian model with perfect memory of previous history was proposed , in which a walker jumps persistently or antipersistently according to prior steps with a probability parameter @xcite . below the critical value of the control parameter , the model shows normal diffusive behaviors while above it , superdiffusive behaviors . due to its simpleness , the microscopic memory effect , the novel key origin of anomalous diffusion ,",
    "was easily applied to other models , among which cressoni et.al .",
    "suggested that the loss of recent memory rather than the distant past can induce persistence , which is relate to the repetitive behaviors , psychological symptoms of alzheimer disease @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that by adding a possibility that a walker does not move at all in the model of @xcite , diffusive , superdiffusive , and subdiffusive behaviors can exhibit in different parameter regimes .",
    "it has advantage to describe the anomalous diffusion within a single model just by changing the parameters , however , in this case , the subdiffusive property may be caused by the staying behavior rather than the memory effect and thus superdiffusion and subdiffusion are not induced by a single origin .",
    "thus although anomalous diffusions have been described by various origins separately , more general origins which can describe the nonstationary mechanisms in both superdiffusions and subdiffusions are still questionable . to answer this , we focus on two features , microscopic memory effect varying with time and the competition between markovian and non - markovian processes which are realized by simple stochastic models . in the first model ,",
    "non - markovian processes induced by the full memory of entire history and markovian processes constructed by the original random walk are competed by a probability parameter . in the second model ,",
    "non - markovian processes are induced by the latest memory rather than full memory and its realizations vary with time . from these models",
    "we find that in the regime where nonmarkovian nature prevails , superdiffusion is induced by the perfect memory , while the latest memory enhanced with time cause subdiffusions as well as superdiffusions .",
    "first , we define a simple microscopic non - markovian model in which a walker moves depending on full memory of its entire history with probability @xmath1 and at random with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the random walker starts at origin and randomly moves either one step to the right or left at time @xmath14 , so the position of the walker becomes @xmath15 with @xmath16 or -1 .",
    "then the random variable @xmath17 is preserved in the set @xmath18 to memory the entire history of the walking process . at time @xmath19",

    "hence it results in the superdiffusion with the relation between the hurst exponent and the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the marginal superdiffusive phenomena is shown for @xmath57 .",
    "these results have been confirmed by computer simulations as shown in the fig .",

    "in conclusion , the microscopic nonstationary mechanisms of anomalous diffusions have been studied through the simple new models with memory effects of previous walk processes . in the models , markovian and nonmarkovian processes",
    "were controlled by the probability parameter , and anomalous diffusions were induced with the hurst exponent related to the parameter .",
    "the perfect memory of whole history invokes superdiffusive behaviors with @xmath2 for @xmath33 in which regime the nonmarkovian nature prevails , while subdiffusions are not invoked .",
    "the anomalous diffusive behaviors involving both superdiffusions and subdiffusions could be described in the mechanism where the latest memory increases with time .",
    "the persistent behaviors with the latest memory enhancement induced the superdiffusions with @xmath4 . while taking the opposite direction to the latest step brought about the subdiffusive behaviors with @xmath5 .",
    "the perfect memory resulted in the long - range step correlation decreasing with time , while even though the memory is restricted to the latest step , the memory enhancement resulted in the long - range correlations increasing with time above the critical time which increases with the interval .",
    "thus the enhancement of memory may be a novel key origin describing all anomalous diffusions and we expect that these time - varying features will be measured in various real systems showing anomalous diffusions and these simple models can be served as basic models in studying another various aspects of anomalous diffusive phenomena .",
    "meanwhile we need to consider the ergodicity breaking in the processes .",
    "it is known that nonstationary stochastic processes are generally not ergodic , that is , the means as ensemble averages are different from those as time averages @xcite .",
    "these processes are nonstationary due to the memory effect and all the analysis in this study was made on the basis of nonequilibrium ensemble averages , so that it does not mean that when time average is run it gives the same hurst exponent as the above provided .",
    "we are going to deal with the ergodicity breaking in these models in elsewhere .",
