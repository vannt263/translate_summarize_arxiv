    "our observation of a metamagnetic behavior in low in - plane fields ( of about @xmath65  t at 2  k ) is consistent with previous findings @xcite .",
    "the non - linearity of the @xmath79 curve likely originates from the field - dependent volume fraction of the four antiferromagnetic domains , in which spins are ( anti)parallel to the @xmath22 or @xmath80 axis .",
    "we can not exclude , however , a more complex spin - reorientation transition taking place at @xmath81  t.    concomitant with the emergence of a long range magnetic ordering at @xmath2 , we observe a transition into a ferroelectric state with the polarization along the @xmath14-direction , which appears under an applied magnetic field .",

    "we assume that the antiferromagnetic order parameter in bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1  is , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the sublattice magnetization labeled by the four independent cu sites occupying the 4c wykoff positions in the crystallographic unit cell with the coordinates @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90",

    "the inversion symmetry breaking by this antiferromagnetic ordering allows for a linear magnetoelectric effect .",
    "we note that the non - centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic order is incompatible with the interpretation of the metamagnetic behavior in terms of a weak ferromagnetic moment @xcite .",
    "the free energy density describing the linear mangetoelectric coupling contains 4 terms allowed by _",
    "p4/ncc _ symmetry of the crystal lattice , @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 are the coupling constants .",

    "we first discuss the magnetoelectric behavior of bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1  in h  @xmath25  a ( see figs .",
    "[ figi](c ) and [ figj](a ) ) .",
    "our polarized neutron scattering data show that in zero field the antiferromagnetic vector @xmath92 lies in the @xmath4 plane .",

    "instead , we observe a metamagnetic transition at @xmath81 t ( see fig .  [ figc ] ) , which indicates that in zero field bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1   is divided into domains with @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the zero - field magnetic susceptibility is then the average of the longitudinal ( @xmath108 ) and transverse ( @xmath109 ) magnetic susceptibilities . above the metamagnetic transition",
    "the @xmath110-domains disappear and the magnetic susceptibility becomes purely transversal , which explains why above @xmath65  t it increases approximately by factor of @xmath111 ( see fig .  [ figc ] ) .",
    "the peculiar dependence of @xmath60 on @xmath112 shown in fig .",
    "[ figj](a ) is consistent with this scenario . as follows from eq.([eq : pz ] ) , the linear magnetoelectric coefficient @xmath113 , which is why @xmath60 grows linearly with the field below @xmath65  t , when the @xmath110-domains are present , and decreases above @xmath65  t , when these domains disappear .",
    "below we discuss the spin - reorientation transition in more detail .",
    "because of tetragonal symmetry of bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , the @xmath107 state has a lower free energy than the @xmath106 for an arbitrarily small @xmath112 .",
    "however , in low applied magnetic fields the motion of domain walls separating the @xmath106 and @xmath107 domains can be hindered by pinning and the ferroelectric state with @xmath114 can survive as a metastable state .",
    "there is , however , an upper critical field , @xmath115 , above which the ferroelectric state becomes locally unstable and disappears .",
    "this can explain the nature of the metamagnetic transition observed at @xmath65  t.    this transition as well as the observed magnetoelectric response can be described using the phenomenological landau theory . assuming that both the vector order parameter and the applied magnetic field are confined to the @xmath4 plane ,",
    "while the electric field is parallel to the @xmath14 axis , we can write the free energy density of bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1  in the form , @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the background magnetic susceptibilty and @xmath121 , @xmath122 being the transition temperature in zero magnetic field .",
    "the quartic anisotropy coefficient , @xmath123 , favors @xmath92 ( anti)parallel to the @xmath22 and @xmath80 axes , while @xmath124 favors @xmath125 .    minimizing the free energy eq.([eq : landau ] ) with respect to @xmath110 for @xmath126",
    ", we obtain the order parameter in the metastable state , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the transition temperature in the applied field .",
    "the ( temperature - dependent ) critical field , @xmath115 , above which this state is unstable , is given by @xmath129    the electric polarization , given by eq.([eq : pz ] ) , is approximately propoportional to @xmath112 , for @xmath130 ( the magnetic field dependence of @xmath110 ( see eq.([eq : l_a ] ) ) is weak , since our experiment shows that the transition temperature is practically field independent ) .",
    "finally , the dielectric susceptibility associated with the antiferromagnetic order is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the antiferromagnetic susceptibility : @xmath133 near the transition ( see ref .",
    "[ ] , where also the effect of spin fluctuations on the critical behavior of the dielectric susceptibility of a linear magnetoelectric material is discussed ) . the dielectric susceptibility diverges because in the applied magnetic field a linear magnetoelectric material becomes ferroelectric , since for @xmath134 the antiferromagnetic order , @xmath110 is linearly coupled to the electric field , @xmath135 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : chic ] ) is consistent with our observations ( see sec .",
    "[ h||a ] ) : the magnetic field dependence of @xmath73 is only strong close to @xmath136 , where the divergence of @xmath137 compensates for the weakness of the magnetoelectric response .    the explanation of the magnetoelectric response in h  @xmath25  c ( see figs .  [",
    "figh](c ) and [ figj](b ) ) is less straightforward .",
    "according to eq.([eq : pz ] ) , the linear magnetoelectric coefficient @xmath138 is only nonzero if @xmath139 .",
    "however , @xmath140 is zero in zero field and h  @xmath25  c is unlikely to result in a transition that rotates @xmath92 out of the @xmath4 plane .",
    "also the linear dependence of @xmath141 on @xmath142 ( figs .",
    "[ figc](a ) and ( c ) ) shows the absence of any transition .",
    "one possible explanation is a small in - plane magnetic field component resulting from a small misalignment of the sample or demagnetizing fields .",
    "note that @xmath143 is @xmath144 times smaller than @xmath145 for @xmath146 t.    another possible explanation is that the actual symmetry of bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1is lower than tetragonal .",
    "we did not , however , find any indication for a symmetry lowering , even though our high - resolution powder x - ray diffraction measurements allow us to resolve tiny thermal expansion effects ( see fig .",
    "[ figx ] ) .",
    "ferroelectricity in bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1can , in principle , be induced by a complex magnetic ordering , such as an incommensurate spin spiral with a small wave vector .",
    "the rotation of the spiral plane in an applied magnetic field , which transforms a non - ferroelectric helical spiral into a ferroelectric cycloidal spiral , can mimic linear magnetoelectric response , as was observed in the cocr@xmath5se@xmath1 spinel @xcite .",
    "however , also in the spiral state scenario it is difficult to explain why the out - of - plane electric polarization is induced by both in - plane and out - of - plane magnetic fields .",
    "a combination of several experimental techniques was applied to clarify the nature of magnetic ordering in floating zone grown bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1  single crystals .",
    "polarized neutron scattering measurements clearly show that ordered magnetic moments of cu ions are confined to the @xmath4 plane , which resolves the long standing controversy .",
    "in addition , we observe a ferroelectric polarization parallel to the @xmath14 axis induced by applied magnetic fields , which is consistent with inversion symmetry breaking by the c - type antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "we argue that the electric polarization in the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath22 axis originates from the linear magnetoelectric effect in a metastable state , which disappears above a critical magnetic field .",
    "the relatively weak response observed in the magnetic field parallel to the @xmath14 axis does not seem to be compatible with symmetry of bi@xmath0cuo@xmath1  and remains a puzzle .",
