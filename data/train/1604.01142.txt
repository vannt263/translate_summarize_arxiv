    "this is the so called risk - neutral situation where the players ( i.e. , the decision makers or controllers ) ignore the risk . if the players are risk - sensitive ( i.e. , risk - averse or risk - seeking ) , then the most appropriate cost criterion is the expectation of the exponential of the integral of costs .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an excellent note on risk - sensitive nash - equilibria . since the cost criterion is the expectation of the exponential of the integral costs , it is multiplicative as opposed to the additive nature of the cost criterion in the expectation of the integral costs case .",
    "due to this , the analysis of the risk - sensitive case is significantly different from its risk - neutral counterpart . to our knowledge ,",
    "the risk - sensitive criterion was first introduce by bellman @xcite , see @xcite and the reference therein . though this criterion has been studied extensively for stochastic optimal control problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the corresponding literature in the context of stochastic differential games is rather limited .",

    "the discounted cost criterion is analyzed in section 3 . under certain additive structural conditions on the drift vector and the cost functions we establish the existence of a nash equilibrium in markov strategies . in section 4",
    "we study the ergodic case . under a lyapunov type stability condition we establish the existence of a nash equilibrium in stationary strategies .",
