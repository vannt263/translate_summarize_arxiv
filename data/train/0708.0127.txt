    "the three methods of accuracy control in the wannier state calculation are proposed . among all the methods , the localization constraint on each wavefunction @xmath10 is imposed as a spherical region whose center is the weighted center of the wavefunction @xmath14 .",

    "the method is demonstrated in nanocrystalline silicon of an isolated cubic sample with 91 atoms .",
    "@xcite the sample is thermally vibrated with 300 k and an additional slow constant - velocity motion is introduced for the atoms on the sample surface . as a result , the sample is stretched in the [ 001 ] direction with thermal vibration .",

    "[ fig - on - dg-91atom - all ] , the radius is chosen to be a constant value of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the equilibrium bond length .",
    "this value is chosen for all wannier states through the simulation . without an external load",
    ", this radius sets the localization region of the wannier states to about @xmath21 atoms .",
    "we should say that a results with the cc method is expected to be rather poor , because the sample in the present md simulation will be stretched by the external load and the number of atoms within the localization region tends to decrease during the md simulation .",
    "this point will be confirmed numerically in the last paragraph of the present subsection .    a better way for accuracy control is to give the number of atoms in the localization region , @xmath22 , instead of a given radius @xmath15 , which realized a flexible control for the localization radius . in this method ,",
    "the radius @xmath15 is chosen so that the localization region contains a given number , @xmath23 , of atoms or more .",
    "this method is called flexible control method at the first level ( ws - fc1 method ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - on - dg-91atom - all](a ) we choose the value of @xmath24 . in results",
    ", the localization radius @xmath15 may be different among the wannier states and the number of atoms within the localization region ( @xmath22 ) always satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "now we explain the third method for setting the localization region , called flexible control method at the second level ( ws - fc2 method ) . in the program code , an iterative solution procedure is carried out for an equation of generalized wannier states .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for the explicit expression of the equation .",
    "since the residual of the equation ( @xmath26 ) is well defined for each wavefunction @xmath10 , the accuracy of a calculated wavefuncion can be rigorously monitored by the residual norm @xmath27 .",
    "the residual norm vanishes , when the calculated wavefuncion will be exact ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "when the wavefunction @xmath29 has a large residual norm @xmath27 , a larger number of atoms ( @xmath16 ) should be assigned inside the localization region so as to reduce the residual norm @xmath27 . in the present code ,",
    "the assignment is carried out automalically for each wavefunction at each time step . in the calculation with fig .",
    "[ fig - on - dg-91atom - all](a ) , we classify all wavefunction into three classes with different numbers @xmath23 ; @xmath30 or 80 .",
    "the classification procedure is carried out with the averaged value @xmath31 of the residual norm among all wavefunctions @xmath32 .",
    "if the residual norm of a wavefunction ( @xmath33 ) is almost the same as its averaged value ( @xmath34 ) , the number of @xmath23 is set to be the small one ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "if the residual norm of a wavefunction ( @xmath33 ) is slightly larger than its averaged value ( @xmath36 ) , the number of @xmath23 is set to be the middle one ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "if the residual norm of a wavefunction ( @xmath33 ) is larger than 150 % of its averaged value ( @xmath38 ) , the number of @xmath23 is set to be the large one ( @xmath39 ) .    when the three control methods with wannier states , ws - cc , ws - fc1 and ws - fc2 methods , are compared , in fig .",
    "[ fig - on - dg-91atom - all](a ) , with a reference data by the conventional eigen state method , one finds that the flexible control methods , fc1 and fc2 methods , are siginificantly better in accuracy than the cc method .",
    "this statement is clarified in fig .",
    "[ fig - on - dg-91atom - all](b ) , when the trajectories without that of the cc method show a better agreement .",
    "although the flexible control methods give , in general , a better accuracy during the md simulation than the cc method , any of the three methods , ws - cc , ws - fc1 and ws - fc2 methods , is sufficient for discussing physical quantities in the present case ; for example , the averaged gradient of fig .",
    "[ fig - on - dg-91atom - all ] is proportional to the young modulus in the [ 001 ] direction @xmath40 , because the stretching motion is realized within a constant velocity .",
    "the young modulus is estimated , commonly among four calculation methods , to be @xmath41gpa , where the estimated value may include an error on the order of 10 % .",
    "the estimated value is comparable with the experimental bulk value @xmath42 gpa but is deviated , owing to the small system size .",
    "satisfactory results are given also for critical stress for cleavage ; @xmath43 gpa .",
    "moreover the cleavage propagation velocity ( not shown ) agrees well among the three wannier state calculations and the eigen - state calculation .",
    "note that the discussion of these quantities in nanocrystalline silicon is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ws - fc2 method is required in several simulations and one example is the case of fig .",
    "[ fig - si110](a ) or silicon cleavage with si(111)-2@xmath121 cleaved surface ; the elementary reconstruction process occurs among several bond sites including surface and subsurface layers , @xcite and a larger region is required for describing wavefunctions near the cleaved surface . since the number of wavefunctions near the cleaved surface accounts for only a small fraction , typically 10 % , of the total number of wavefunctions , the total computational cost of the fc2 method is moderate , when compared with the cc method .",
    "finally we note that a similar flexible control is also used in krylov - subspace theory , another theory for large - scale - calculation theory",
    ". see appendix of ref .",
    "in this paper , we focus the way of accuracy control in dynamical process or md simulation .",
    "flexible control methods are proposed so as to realize large - scale process ( md ) calculation , in which the electronic freedoms are determined optimally at each time step .    since nature ( or electronic structure ) of physical system",
