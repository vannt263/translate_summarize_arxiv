    "today the @xmath2-scheme is the _ de facto _ standard used for comparisons of qcd predictions as well as experimental results .",
    "it was introduced for practical reason , as an offspring of dimensional regularisation , whereas the method of effective charges ( ech ) and the corresponding renormalisation scheme are motivated physically .",
    "the ech method has been in some detail discussed in the talk of maxwell @xcite . for completeness here the basic formulae and results",
    "are assembled in view of the later interpretation of the data .",
    "ech has been originally introduced in @xcite , a clear access , taking the observable itself as perturbative expansion parameter ( called renormalisation group improved perturbation theory , rgi ) is given in @xcite .",
    "with respect to ech i follow the arguments of @xcite which applies the ech method directly to @xmath3data .",
    "the results especially apply to mean values ( or moments ) of the event shape distributions which depend on a single energy scale , the centre - of - mass energy , @xmath4 , only .",
    "the general next - to - leading order ( nlo ) expression for event shape distributions of an observable @xmath5 reads : @xmath6 + { \\cal{o}}(\\alpha_s)^3 \\label{eq : secondorder}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the first and second order coefficients of the perturbative expansion .",
    "note that due to the normalisation to the total cross - section the integral of eqn .",
    "[ eq : secondorder ] is normalised to 1 .",
    "the @xmath9 ( or alternatively the @xmath10 ) dependence reflects the dependence of the prediction on the renormalisation scheme . in nlo",
    "the change of renormalisation scheme is fully equivalent to the change of the renormalisation scale .",
    "weighting eqn .",
    "[ eq : secondorder ] with and integrating over the observable then yields the mean value @xmath11 which can be directly measured .",
    "normalising @xmath11 to the leading order coefficient @xmath7 a measurable quantity @xmath12 is obtained .",
    "such quantities are called effective charges .",
    "the idea of the ech method is now to chose ( in any order of perturbation theory ) a scheme such that all higher order coefficients for @xmath12 vanish .",
    "this implies that @xmath12 coincides with the strong coupling extracted in a leading order analysis and explains the name ech as such observables are directly comparable to other observables of this kind as well as to the coupling . in nlo this leads to the following scale : @xmath13 an effective charge @xmath12 obeys the renormalisation group equation ( rge ) : @xmath14\\quad + \\quad k_0\\cdot e^{-s / r}r^{\\delta}+\\dots \\label{eq : rge}\\ ] ] as the observables @xmath12 are directly measurable in dependence of the energy the @xmath15-functions are measurable quantities .",
    "the leading coefficients of the @xmath1-functions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are universal ( the same as for the coupling ) , the higher coefficients are observable dependent but free of renormalisation scheme ambiguities .",
    "non - perturbative contributions , invisible in perturbation theory , lead to the term with the exponential .",
    "@xmath18 is proportional to the factor multiplying a power term in the usual power model expressions . omitting for simplicity the non - perturbative term eqn .",
    "[ eq : rge ] can be integrated yielding : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined by the square bracketed term in eqn .",
    "[ eq : rge ] .",
    "the constant of integration , @xmath21 , should have _ physical significance _ and is related to @xmath22 by an * exact * expression @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath23  can be calculated from @xmath21 practically without additional uncertainty .    besides the derivation of the above fundamental equations the paper @xcite includes a broad discussion of the extraction of @xmath24  from @xmath3data and shows the following :    * the _ ech formalism",
    "... is more general than the adoption of a particular scheme ... _ it can be derived _",
    "non - perturbatively _ assuming only that the high energy behavior of the observable is given by the leading order perturbative expression . * ... _ higher orders can be split into a predictable contribution _ ( of known `` rg predictable '' terms @xmath25 ) _ and a remaining piece containing all the genuinely unknown aspects . _ ... _ the choice @xmath26 _ removes the predictable scatter and provides genuine information on the interesting ... higher - order _ _ terms . *",
    "_ one can exhibit the relative size of the _ ( truly ) _ uncalculated higher - order corrections for different quantities_. these corrections _ are related to how the energy dependence of the quantity differs from its asymptotic dependence as @xmath27 .",
    "_ * _ ... by comparing with data one can test how well the first few _ perturbative terms _ represent the observed running .",
    "_ marked discrepancies indicate the importance of _ higher order terms , or ... non - perturbative contributions .",
    "_    these findings imply that the ech scheme offers exceptional experimental control of higher order contributions by comparing different effective charge observables or measuring their energy evolution .      the later discussion is mainly based on precise data of shape distributions obtained at the z - peak and of their mean values in the full range of @xmath3  experiments above the b - threshold .",
    "some more recent results @xcite refer to the energy range @xmath2820 - 202 ge-0.2exv  and comprise data on events with a radiated hard photon ( @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "all experimental results correspond to simple @xmath3  annihilation and are fully corrected for experimental effects .",
    "it has been realised @xcite , that hadron mass effects have a particularly strong influence for the so - called jet mass observables .",
    "this strong mass dependence has been avoided in @xcite by redefining the particle four momenta using the so called p - scheme : ( @xmath30 ) or e - scheme : ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "moreover in @xcite extra transverse momentum from b - hadron decays was corrected for by using monte carlo .",
    "this correction is power behaved and can have influence on the energy evolution of the observables .",

    "b - decays also influence event shape distributions . for 2-jet like topologies the distributions are depleted .",
    "these events are shifted towards 3-jet topologies by the extra transverse momentum from the decay . for observables calculated from the whole event ( like @xmath32 ) the decay from the narrow event side contributes for all values of the observable leading to visible effects in the whole range of the observable . in principle",

    "several experiments attempted , however , to determine optimal scales by fitting @xmath0  and @xmath35  simultaneously to the data . in view of this , so called experimental optimisation , it is instructive to discuss the influence of @xmath35  on the prediction eqn .",

    "other observables show a similar though often less pronounced discrepancy . as a consequence",
    "the quality of the fits for @xmath35=1 is , in general , unsatisfactorily bad and the fitted values of @xmath0  depend on the interval chosen for the fit .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : asthrxmu ] e.g. for the thrust @xcite .",
    "this behavior is basically known since petra  @xcite or the early days of lep  and has been observed at small values of the event shape observables ( in the 2-jet region ) where the perturbative @xmath39  predictions are presumed little reliable .",
    "it should be noted , however , that due to the normalisation of the event shape distributions @xmath40 , the misfit between data and prediction must persist at large @xmath5 if present at small @xmath5 .",
    "this has indeed been seen @xcite .",
    "the optimisation of a single scale value for a distribution has been criticised @xcite as , in principle , the scale is expected to be @xmath5-dependent ( compare eqn .",
    "[ eq : xech ] ) . however , the change of scale expected in the typical fit ranges of the data is moderate ( compare fig .  [",

    "results on experimental optimisation are included in @xcite .",
    "the first reference , which is discussed below , comprises 18 observables and is based on high statistics data . moreover in this analysis the dependence of the event shape distributions on the polar angle of the event axis with respect to the beam has been exploited .",
    "this is advantageous in view of experimental systematics and leads to a large number of statistically independent data points .",

    "the matching from an experimental point of view represents a kind of `` averaging '' of both predictions where in the 2-jet regime the nlla part and in the 3-jet regime the @xmath39  part dominates . as in the matching the @xmath39  prediction",

    "as discussed above for the pure @xmath39  prediction persist , though diminished by the matching with the nlla part . in consequence the @xmath41 is often in - acceptably bad when applying standard rules .",
    "additional theory errors are introduced to regain consistency . as in the @xmath39case",
    "the fitted value of @xmath23  often shows a marked dependence on the observable . to illustrate this in fig .",

    "it is likely that a large part of the annoying and unsatisfactorily large spread of the @xmath23  results obtained from different event shape observables using standard analyses is due to perturbing logarithmic terms induced by the choice of the so - called physical scale and the @xmath2   renormalisation scheme . given the above quoted positive ech results experimentalists should be encouraged to also analyse their data using the ech scheme where possible and not regard this alternative to the @xmath2  convention as a heretical digression .",
