    "the heavy hadron spectroscopy played a major role in the foundation of qcd .",
    "in last few years , it has sparked a renewed interest in the subject due to numerous data available from the b factories , cleo , lhcb and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "in more recent times the discovery of x - y states @xcite as possible charmonium and bottonium hybrids have extended such study of the exotic heavy hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the most recent discoveries of the charmonium pentaquarks @xcite have further increase its importance .",
    "the simplest system of this area are the heavy - light and heavy - heavy hadrons .",
    "+ in the present paper , we will report a study of such heavy flavored mesons in a qcd potential model persued in recent years . in the last few years",
    ", the experimental study of heavy - light and heavy - heavy mesons have renewed the theoretical interest towards hqet ( heavy quark effective theory ) and isgur wise function @xcite .",
    "+ the present work takes into account the idea of quantum mechanics that a scale factor ` c ' in a potential should not effect the wave function of the meson while using perturbation theory like dalgarno s method @xcite.here both the short range and long range effect is tried to incorporate in the total wave function . because in our earlier works @xcite , the properties of the mesons are studied considering the coulombic part of the cornell potential dominant over the linear part . on the other side of our work @xcite , the schrodinger equation is solved by considering the linear part to be dominant over the coulombic part .",
    "+ in section 2 , we outline the formalism , while in section 3 summarize the results for masses of various mesons and slope and curvature for i - w function .",
    "section 4 contains conclusion and comments .",
    "the non - relativistic two body schrodinger equation @xcite is @xmath5 so that the first order perturbed eigenfunction @xmath6 and eigenenergy @xmath7 can be obtained using the relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10    we calculate the total wave function using dalgarno s method of perturbation for the potential @xmath11    where -@xmath12 is due to the color factor , @xmath13 is the strong coupling constant , r is the inter quark distance , b is the confinement parameter ( phenomenologically , @xmath14 @xcite ) and ` c ' is a constant scale factor .",
    "@xcite , the parent and perturbed hamiltonian were considered respectively as    @xmath15    and @xmath16    the total wave function for this case is @xmath17 \\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-\\epsilon}e^{-\\frac{r}{a_0}},\\ ] ]    where normalisation constant    @xmath18 ^ 2\\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-2\\epsilon } e^{-\\frac{2r}{a_0}}dr\\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{2}}},\\ ] ]    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of the light and heavy quark / antiquark respectively and @xmath23 is the reduced mass of the mesons and    @xmath24    the relativistic effect due to dirac modification factor and @xmath25 is the undetermined coefficient appearing in the series solution of schrodinger equation .",

    "now in the present work we want to see whether the term ` c ' has also its effect even if we consider ` c ' in the parent part of the hamiltonian .",
    "+ to explore the effect of ` c ' in the parent hamilonian we make two choices for the potential ( 5 ) : + choice - i:@xmath46 as parent and br as perturbation or + choice - ii : br+c as parent and @xmath47 as perturbation . +",
    "using dalgarno s method of perturbation the total wave function for choice - i upto @xmath28 is [ appendix - a ] : + @xmath48\\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-\\epsilon } e^{-\\frac{r}{a_0}},\\ ] ]    where the normalization constant @xmath49 is    @xmath50 ^ 2\\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-2\\epsilon } e^{-\\frac{2r}{a_0}}dr\\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{2}}}.\\ ] ]    similiarly , the wave function for choice - ii including relativistic effect @xcite considering upto o(@xmath51 ) [ appendix - b ] is    @xmath52a_i[\\rho_1 r+\\rho_0 ] \\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-\\epsilon},\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the normalization constant    @xmath54 ^ 2 \\left ( a_i[\\rho_1 r+\\rho_0]\\right ) ^2 \\left ( \\frac{r}{a_0}\\right ) ^{-2\\epsilon}dr\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } .\\ ] ]    the co - efficients are    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    the equations ( 25 ) and ( 27 ) shows that even if we consider the scale factor ` c ' in the parent hamiltonian its effect will be on the the total wave function .",
    "+ therefore dalgarno s method in general conflicts with the quantum mechanical idea that the scale factor ` c ' should not have an observable effect except the energy shift .",
    "+ there are two possible ways of making the perturbative approach adequate to quantum mechanics . at phenomenological level",
    "one keeps the scale factor in the potential so that it can contribute to the short and long range of the inter quark distance @xcite without modifying the wave function further .",
    "a more theoretically satisfactory approach will be to limit the domain the applicability of dalgarno s method .",
    "this approach is then corrected quantum mechanically .",
    "we take this later view point in the present paper . + for the validation of the quantum mechanical expectation we therefore consider @xmath58 in the potential of equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the heavy quark meson is governed by the inter quark potential .",
    "the properties of the heavy mesons are in rough approximation is described by the cornell potential as defined in equation ( 5 ) , which is the sum of a coulomb , linear and a scale factor .",
    "both the potentials play decisive role in the quark dynamics and there seperation is not possible . besides there is no appropriate small parameter so that one of the potential within a perturbative theory can be made perturbative .",
    "+ however it is well known that at short distance coulomb potential plays a more dominant role than the linear confinement because while the former is inversely proportional to ` r ' , the later is linear . similarly , for large distance",
    "the confinement takes over the coulomb effect .",
    "therefore if the inter - quark seperation ` r ' can be roughly divided into short distance ( @xmath1 ) and long distance ( @xmath2 ) effectively one of the potential will dominate over the other .",
    "in such situation confinement parameter ( b ) and the strong coupling parameter ( @xmath13 ) can be considered as effective and appropriate small pertubative parameters .",
    "+      masses of heavy flavored mesons in a specific potential model in the ground state can be obtained as : @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the mass of pseudoscalar meson and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the masses of quark and anti - quark of the meson respectively . + the above expression shows that to calculate the masses of mesons one needs to find @xmath63 , so that @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    to take into account both the coulomb and linear part of the potential we improve the above equation with the cut off scales @xmath1 and @xmath2 as    @xmath67.\\ ] ]      isgur , wise",
    ", georgi and others showed that in weak semi - leptonic decays of heavy light mesons ( e.g. b mesons to d or @xmath68 mesons ) , in the limit @xmath69 all the form factors that describe these decays are expressible in terms of a single universal function of velocity transfer , which is normalized to unity at zero - recoil .",
    "this function is known as the isgur - wise function .",
    "it measures the overlap of the wave functions of the light degrees of freedom in the initial and final mesons moving with velocities @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "+ the isgur - wise functions are defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the normalization condition at the zero - recoil point ( @xmath75 ) @xcite .",

    "we therefore set a cut off @xmath91 in the integration limit and later we fixed it to 1 fm @xcite for our calculations .",
    "+ to find the cut offs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we use the two choices of perturbative conditions : + choice - i : @xmath92    choice - ii :    @xmath93    from ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) we can find the bounds on r upto which case - i and ii are valid .",
    "case - i gives the cut off on the short distance @xmath94 and case - ii gives the cut off on the long distance @xmath95 .",
    "+ in table-1 , we show the bounds on @xmath1 and @xmath2 in fermi which yields exact / most restrictive upper bounds of the quantities to be calculated",

    "@xcite and @xcite are plotted in both the graphs .",
    "figures show that the computed results are well within the other model values @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the values of masses and convexity parameter of the i - w function considering the scaling factor ` c ' as zero .",
    "one of the important point about this work is that we have given equal fitting to both the coulomb and linear part of the cornell potential unlike in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "also our calculations provide a measure of the slope and curvature of the form factors with finite mass corrections .",
    "we can say that the modification induced by mass effect are not so significant .",
    "furthermore , the consideration of the finite mass correction changes the results only slightly ( significantly for @xmath98 meson ) .",
    "however , for the mesons where light quark / antiquark is not so light compared to the heavy quark / antiquark , the finite mass limit do show a very strong dependence on the spectator quark mass ; for example we can see @xmath99 meson ( table-4 ) .",
    "+ our calculated values of masses of mesons are found to be in good agreement with the experimental values ( table-2 ) .",
    "also the calculated values of slope and curvature of i - w function in this work are well within the limit of other theoretical values ( table-3 ) .",
    "however the re - evaluation of the model with a non - zero scaling factor with the satisfaction of the quantum mechanical idea is currently under study .",
    "+ let us conclude this paper with a comment that the relativity is by no means negligible for heavy - light systems .",
    "such effects do not merely lead to a dirac modification factor as used in the present work , but also have other significant effects as have been studied in various relativistic treatments of the problem @xcite .",
    "inspite of the phenomenological success of the present model , it falls short of such expectation .",
