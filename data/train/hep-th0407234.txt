    "[ intro ]    recent suggestions that large @xcite@xcite or infinite @xcite@xcite extra dimensions are not necessarily in conflict with present observations provide new opportunities for addressing several outstanding problems of modern theoretical physics like the hierarchy problem @xcite@xcite,@xcite , @xcite or the cosmological constant problem @xcite@xcite . in the course of this development and inspired by string theoretical arguments @xcite ,",
    "the notion of brane world scenarios emerged in which the usual standard model fields are supposed to be confined to a so - called @xmath7-brane , a @xmath5-dimensional sub - manifold of some higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "as shown in @xcite also gravity can appear to be effectively @xmath5-dimensional for a brane - bound observer provided the conventional scheme of kaluza - klein compactification @xcite@xcite is replaced by a compactification using non - factorizable ( also called warped ) geometries ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this triggered an immense research activity in theories involving @xmath7-branes with interests ranging from elucidating the global space - time structure of brane world scenarios , properties of gravity , cosmology and brane cosmological perturbations , generalizations to higher dimensions etc .",
    "while the possibilities are rich , realistic scenarios remain rare .",
    "for example the simple randall - sundrum - ii model @xcite faces the problem of being geodesically incomplete @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to look for adequate alternatives or generalizations to the randall - sundrum - ii model which avoid the above mentioned problems while sharing its pleasant feature of the effective @xmath5-dimensional low energy gravity on the brane .    in this paper",
    "we present a @xmath8-dimensional brane - world model which solves the geodesic incompleteness of the randall - sundrum ii model while preserving its phenomenological properties concerning the localization of gravity .",
    "we try to illustrate our motivation for considering a particular geometry by using the simple picture of a domain structure in extra dimensions resulting from a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry .",
    "the associated higgs - field takes different values in regions separated by a domain wall , which restricts the possibilities of combining domain walls depending on the global topology of the space - time under consideration .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath8-dimensional case , see @xcite,@xcite@xcite for higher dimensional constructions .",
    "let us analyze a few simple cases :    non - compact extra dimension    : @xmath9 . in this case , by choosing the origin @xmath10 to coincide with the position of the brane",
    ", we obtain two non - overlapping regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 and we can thus consistently have one brane in such a theory .",
    "an example for this configuration is provided by the randall - sundrum ii model @xcite .    compact extra dimension    : @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we now consider two possibilities , depending on the spatial topology of our manifold :    * ( a ) *    @xmath14 : if the ordinary dimensions are supposed to be non - compact , it is not possible to consistently put only one brane in the extra dimensions .",
    "at least two branes are needed .    *",
    "( b ) *    @xmath1 : if _ all _ spatial coordinates are part of a compact manifold , the simple picture shown in fig .",
    "[ ct ] seems to suggest that it is possible to consistently put a single brane in the bulk space - time .    to the best of our knowledge case * ( b ) * has not yet been considered in the literature and our aim is to present such a construction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ one ] we discuss the basic geometric and topological properties of our brane - world scenario like einstein equations , junction conditions and the distance hierarchy between the extra dimension @xmath2 and the observable universe @xmath3 .",
    "section [ two ] is dedicated to the study of geodesics and the demonstration that our model does not suffer from being geodesically incomplete . in section",
    "[ three ] we present a detailed computation of the propagator of a massless scalar field in the given background serving as an easy , phenomenological approach to the study of gravity .",
    "we discuss the behavior of the two - point function in three different distance regimes .",
    "it turns out that the computations are rather technical and we therefore collect large parts of it in four appendices .",
    "we eventually draw conclusions in section [ four ] .",
    "[ one ] the aim of this section is to present the topology and geometry of the brane - world model which we set out to study but also to motivate how this particular model emerged through imposing several physical conditions on the more general set of solutions .",
    "we would like to construct a space - time with all spatial dimensions being part of the same compact manifold .",
    "one more motivation for this lies in a possible solution of the strong cp problem within theories with extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the overall topology would then be given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the time - coordinate and @xmath17 any compact manifold .",
    "as announced , we will restrict ourselves to the case of one extra dimension and an induced metric on the brane characterized by a spatial component of geometry @xmath18 .",
    "the idea is to combine two @xmath8-dimensional regions of space - time dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath19 in such a way that the border of the two regions can be identified with a @xmath7-brane , constituting our observable universe .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite the manifold @xmath17 has to be highly anisotropic in order to single out the small extra dimension from the three usual ones .",
    "it is not a priory clear whether the einstein equations allow for such solutions at all and if so whether gravity can be localized on the brane in such a setup .",

    "finally we would like to point out a very peculiar property of the manifold under consideration : as it can immediately be deduced from the line element ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ sigmaandgamma ] ) , any two points on the brane are separated by not more than a distance of the order of @xmath2 regardless of their distance as measured by an observer on the brane using the induced metric .",
    "[ two ]    it is well known that the randall sundrum - ii model is timelike and lightlike geodesically incomplete @xcite which means that there exists inextendible timelike and lightlike geodesics .",
    "an inextendible geodesic is a geodesic parametrized by an affine parameter @xmath81 such that by using up only a finite amount of affine parameter the geodesic extends over infinite coordinate distances . in a more physical language",
    "one could reformulate the above statement by saying that it takes only a finite amount of affine parameter @xmath81 in order to reach the infinities of the incomplete space - time . as we will illustrate later in this chapter ,",
    "the reason why the randall - sundrum ii setup ceases to be geodesically complete is simply due to a specific way of gluing two patches of @xmath0 .",
    "one of the main motivations for this work was to provide an alternative to the randall sundrum ii model that has the advantage of being geodesically complete while conserving the pleasant phenomenological features of the latter .",
    "we divide the discussion of geodesics in two parts : in subsection [ rsgeod ] we illustrate the effects of incomplete geodesics in the randall - sundrum ii setup for timelike and lightlike geodesics . in the following subsection [ ourgeod ]",
    "we demonstrate why our setup is geodesically complete by looking at corresponding geodesics . finally , we complement the discussions by illustrating the physics with the use of the penrose - diagram of ( the universal covering space - time of ) @xmath0 .",
    "our discussion of geodesics in this chapter is in no sense meant to be complete . without going into the details of the computations we merely intend to present the solutions of the geodesic equations in certain cases . for more general and more complete discussions of this issue we refer to the literature ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we first consider lightlike geodesics in the randall - sundrum ii background metric given in appendix [ appparallel ] , eq .",
    "( [ rsmetric ] ) .",
    "let us suppose that a photon is emitted at the brane at @xmath10 in the positive @xmath82-direction at coordinate time @xmath83 then reflected at @xmath84 at the time @xmath85 to be observed by an observer on the brane at time @xmath86 .",
    "in this situation @xmath87 corresponds to the proper time of an observer on the brane at rest .",
    "a simple calculation reveals @xmath88 a brane bound observer will therefore note that it takes an infinite time for a photon to escape to @xmath89 .",
    "however , parameterizing the same geodesic by an affine parameter @xmath81 reveals the lightlike incompleteness of the randall - sundrum ii space - time .",
    "let the events of emission , refection ( at @xmath84 ) and arrival on the brane again be labeled by @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "using the geodesic equation @xmath93 an easy computation shows : @xmath94 the constant @xmath50 is a remnant of the freedom in the choice of an affine parameter . and @xmath81",
    "are related by @xmath95 , since this is the most general transformation leaving the geodesic equation ( [ geodesicequation ] ) invariant .",
    "the choice of the origin of time to coincide with the emission of the photon only fixes @xmath96 but does not restrict @xmath50 . ] from the last equation we see that now @xmath97 meaning that in order to reach infinity ( @xmath98 in the extra dimension it takes only a finite amount @xmath99 of affine parameter @xmath81 , the expression of incompleteness of the randall - sundrum ii space - time with respect to affinely parametrized lightlike geodesics .    in the case of timelike geodesics",
    "the inconsistency is even more striking . as shown in e.g. @xcite , a massive particle starting at the brane with vanishing initial velocity travels to @xmath89 in finite proper time given by @xmath100 while for a brane - bound observer this happens in an infinite coordinate time . to summarize , the randall - sundrum ii brane - world model is geodesically incomplete both for null and for timelike geodesics . as we will see in the next section ,",
    "the geodesic incompleteness is a direct consequence of the use of a particular coordinate system in @xmath0 , the so - called poincar - coordinate system , which covers only a part of the full @xmath0 space - time .",
    "we will also see that the problem of incomplete geodesics is absent in the setup we propose in this paper .",
    "we would now like to answer similar questions to the ones considered in the previous section for the background ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "for example , we would like to know what time it takes for light to travel from the brane ( at @xmath37=0 ) in the @xmath37-direction to a given point in the upper hemisphere with @xmath37 coordinate @xmath101 , to be reflected and to return to the brane . as in the last section ,",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath81 will denote the coordinate time ( proper time of a stationary observer on the brane ) and the affine parameter used for parameterizing the geodesics , respectively .",
    "again we choose @xmath83 ( @xmath90 ) for the moment of emission , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) for the reflection and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) for the time where the photon returns to the brane . due to the enormous hierarchy of distance scales in our model , one might wonder whether photons ( or gravitons ) are able to carry information from an arbitrary point on the brane to any other point on the brane connected to the first one by a null - geodesic in the extra dimension .",
    "for an observer on the brane such a possibility would be interpreted as 4-dimensional causality - violation . however , as we will see in the following , none of these possibilities exist in our model . omitting all details",
    "we find @xmath106 } \\right],\\ ] ] so that an observer on the brane will see that the photon reaches the `` north pole '' @xmath107 at finite time @xmath108     \\approx r_u \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ , .\\ ] ] note that due to the warped geometry , it is @xmath3 entering the last relation and not @xmath2 , so that even though the physical distance to the `` north pole '' is of the order of @xmath2 it takes a time of the order of @xmath3 for photons to reach it , excluding causality violation on the brane as discussed above . if the same geodesic is parametrized using an affine parameter we obtain @xmath109}{\\cosh \\frac{\\omega\\pi}{2}}\\right]\\ , , \\ ] ] such that the amount of affine parameter needed to reach @xmath107 starting from the brane is : @xmath110 here again @xmath50 reflects the freedom in the choice of the affine parameter .",
    "the results formally resemble those of the randall - sundrum ii case . however , the important difference is that in our case each geodesic can trivially be extended to arbitrary values of the affine parameter , a simple consequence of the compactness of our space .",
    "once the photon reaches the point @xmath62 it continues on its geodesic , approaching the brane , entering the southern `` hemisphere '' , etc .",
    "it is clear that it needs an infinite amount of affine parameter in order to travel infinite coordinate distances .",
    "therefore , the null geodesics in our setup which are the analogues of the incomplete null geodesics in the randall - sundrum ii setup turn out to be perfectly complete due to the compactness of our space .",
    "the situation for timelike geodesics is fully analog to the case of the null geodesics .    to end this section about the geometric properties of our model we would like to discuss the conformal structure of our space - time and point out differences to the randall - sundrum ii setup .",
    "let us review briefly the basic properties of @xmath0 space - time to the extend that we will need it in the following discussion .",

    "note that the position of the randall - sundrum brane can not be represented in a simple way in the penrose diagram of @xmath122 .",

    "[ three ]    there are at least two equivalent ways of addressing the problem of the localization of gravity in brane - world scenarios .",

    "the coordinates of @xmath0 used by randall and sundrum are closely related to the so - called poincar coordinates of @xmath0 .",
    "while the extra dimension in this set of coordinates provides a slicing of @xmath0 along flat @xmath5-dimensional minkowski sections ( resulting in a flat minkowskian induced metric on the brane ) , their disadvantage is that they do not cover the whole of @xmath0 space - time .",

    "one can easily convince oneself that in the limit @xmath336 the resulting green s function is independent of the choice of the ( homogeneous ) boundary condition at @xmath346 .",
    "we therefore follow @xcite and use also a neumann boundary condition at @xmath346 .",

    "finally we note that this factor of @xmath347 can be accounted for by an overall redefinition of the 5-dimensional newton s constant leaving the two theories with equivalent predictions .",

    "we face the following major technical difficulties : there is no analog of cauchy s theorem in the discrete case of the fourier sum .",

    "the procedure again is similar to the one outlined for the randall - sundrum case .",
    "another technical problem , however , in connection with large distances corrections has its origin in the simple fact that by large distances in our setup we mean distances large with respect to the extra dimension @xmath2 but also small with respect to the size of the observable universe @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we present a brane - world scenario in which two regions of @xmath0 space - time are glued together along a 3-brane with constant positive curvature such that _ all _ spatial dimensions form a compact manifold of topology @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the induced geometry on the brane is given by einstein s static universe . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to achieve an anisotropy of the manifold which allows for a huge hierarchy between the size of the extra dimension @xmath2 and the size of the observable universe @xmath3 at present . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy is also at the origin of a very peculiar property of our model : the physical distance between _ any two points _ on the brane is of the order of the size of the extra dimension @xmath2 regardless of their distance measured with the use of the induced metric on the brane . in an intermediate distance regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 gravity on the brane is shown to be effectively @xmath5-dimensional , with corresponding large distance corrections , in complete analogy with the randall - sundrum ii model . </S>",
    "<S> for very large distances @xmath6 we recover gravity in einstein s static universe . however , in contrast to the randall - sundrum ii model the difference in topology has the advantage of giving rise to a geodesically complete space . </S>"
