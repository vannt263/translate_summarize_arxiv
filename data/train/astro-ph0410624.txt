    "a key property of the cosmic radiation is the division between those particles of galactic origin and those which are extragalactic .",
    "it is virtually certain that those below about loge ( ev ) = 17 are galactic ( g ) and that the very highest energy particles are extragalactic ( eg ) , but the energy ( e@xmath7 ) at which eg starts to dominate is debatable .",
    "it is this question that is the subject of this paper .    in every model",
    "the galactic magnetic field progressively loses its trapping power as the rigidity increases so that the mean charge of the detected galactic particles increases .",
    "ideally , measurements of the mass composition should be possible and these would appear to indicate e@xmath7 but there is the distinct likelihood of a significant fraction of heavy nuclei in the eg beam .    here , we start by considering the measured spectral shape and then examine the possibility of an explanation in terms of primary protons .",
    "this is followed by an analysis of the mass composition and its relevance to the galactic / extragalactic boundary .",
    "a number of measurements have been made over the years , using increasingly large extensive air shower ( eas ) arrays .",
    "our earlier work @xcite gave a summary and here we update the analysis .",
    "figure 1 gives the individual spectra .",
    "it will be noted that , when the energy range covered is large enough , there is clear evidence for the presence of an ankle . defining ` sharpness ' as in related work , ( e.g. @xcite ) , by s = @xmath8 with a bin width of loge = 0.2  or converted to that value  the values derived by us are",
    "as given in table 1 ( references to the individual arrays are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    a variety of methods have been used to determine the sharpness values including a variation where the regions near the individual ankles ( @xmath90.2 in loge ) are not used in determining the actual ankle position in each case .",
    "the result is that there should be no artificial sharpening of the overall ankle ( a situation suggested by some , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the superimposed spectra normalized to the datum intensity @xcite and the ankle - energy .",
    "it is evident that the well known large systematic differences in intensity do not occur until beyond the ankle region .",
    "figure 3 shows the combined data  and corresponding uncertainties . the extent to which our simple explanation in terms of the addition of a rapidly falling g - spectrum and a standard ( approximately e@xmath10 ) eg - spectrum fits the data near",
    "the ankle is clear .",
    "the expectation ( sum ) has observational uncertainties added to it ; their effect is very small .",
    "returning to the sharpness values , set ( 3 ) in table 1 is probably the safest to use .",
    "the mean value is s = @xmath11 where the ` error ' has been derived from the dispersion of the individual values .",
    "the expected value for the ` intersecting lines ' from g and eg spectra , is s = 0.96 without experimental resolution , falling to @xmath120.90 with the inclusion of noise .",
    "thus , there is consistency .",
    "as remarked earlier , the competing models have the galactic flux reduced to a very low level by the time the ankle is reached and the ankle is formed by the effect of e@xmath13e@xmath14 production on the ( assumed ) eg proton spectrum .",
    "figure 4 shows the galactic fraction for the various models , including our own .",
    "figure 5 shows the rate of energy loss for e@xmath13e@xmath14 and pion production from our own calculations @xcite and by others @xcite .",
    "if a function of this type is multiplied by an assumed eg injection spectrum then the usual form of eg - proton spectrum is derived ; it is evident that there is , indeed , an ankle in the region of log e = 19 .",
    "figure 6 shows the multiplying factor for a number of situations , to be described .",
    "it should be pointed out that the use of the factor taken simply as the reciprocal of figure 5 , is for a euclidian universe , ie with no expansion and integration for a uniform spatial and temporal distribution of sources out to the hubble radius .",
    "in fact , there will be a number of factors which perturb the simple form of the predicted spectrum , particularly at and below several times log e = 19 ( at higher energies the collection volume is local and expansion effects are small ) .",
    "the factors of concern are :    * the limit on red - shift beyond which the spatial density of galaxies  which are potential sources of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr )  becomes small . * scattering of particles , which increases the path length and thereby travel time . * possible @xmath15-dependent production rates ( the ` cosmological increase ' ",
    "e.g. @xcite ) * the enhanced cmb temperature , and consequent increased energy loss rates for the protons , as @xmath15 increases . *",
    "the stochastic nature of the sources in space and in time .",
    "concerning 1 , there is the immediate problem relating to the actual nature of the sources of uhecr . in order of increasing",
    "general activity we have the following approximate densities , in units of number per gpc@xmath6 ."

    "<S> we have argued ( e.g. @xcite ) that the well - known ` ankle ' in the cosmic ray energy spectrum , at loge ( ev ) @xmath0 18.7 - 19.0 , marks the transition from mainly galactic sources at lower energies to mainly extragalactic above . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , there have been claims for lower transitional energies , specifically from loge ( ev ) @xmath0 17.0 @xcite via @xmath1 @xcite to 18.0 @xcite . in our model </S>",
    "<S> the ankle arises naturally from the sum of simple power law - spectra with slopes differing by @xmath2 ; from differential slope @xmath3 for galactic particles ( near loge = 19 ) to @xmath4 for extragalactic sources . in the other models , on the other hand , the ankle is intrinsic to the extragalactic component alone , and arises from the shape of the rate of energy loss versus energy for the ( assumed ) protons interacting with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> + our detailed analysis of the world s data on the ultra - high energy spectrum shows that taken together , or separately , the resulting mean sharpness of the ankle ( second difference of the log(intensity@xmath5e@xmath6 ) with respect to loge ) is consistent with our ` mixed ' model . </S>",
    "<S> for explanation in terms of extragalactic particles alone , however , the ankle will be at the wrong energy  for reasonable production models and of insufficient magnitude if , as seems likely , there is still a significant fraction of heavy nuclei at the ankle energy . </S>"
