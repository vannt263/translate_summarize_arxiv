    "prior to the discovery of bose - einstein condensates , the only quantum liquids realized experimentally are the electron liquids in solids , and the low temperature phases of liquid @xmath6he and @xmath7he .",
    "all these systems are made up of spin-1/2 fermions ( like electrons and and @xmath7he atoms ) , or spin-0 bosons ( @xmath6he atoms ) .",
    "recent advances in the cooling of atomic gases , however , have created the exciting opportunities of studying high spin quantum fluids .",
    "the spins of atomic bosons can range from @xmath8 ( @xmath9rb bosons ) to @xmath10 ( @xmath11dy bosons)@xcite , and the spin of atomic fermions can be as high as @xmath12 ( @xmath13k ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15dy)@xcite .",
    "theoretical generalizations of the bose - einstein condensate and fermion pair superfluids to high spin particles have been made about a decade ago @xcite .",
    "while there are many experiments on large spin bose condensates ( or spinor condensates ) , experiments on large spin fermions are still at their infancy . at present , there is no realization of the superfluid phases of large spin fermions because of their very low transition temperatures . on the other hand , scatterings in different angular momentum channel and dipolar effects",
    "can lead to non - trivial spin structures in the normal state , which may be realized at higher temperatures .",
    "these scattering lengths in various spin channels can be measured using techniques in ref.@xcite .",
    "as we shall see , these scattering lengths can lead to a great variety of spin structures in the normal state , most of which do not have analogs in solid state systems .    the possibility of rich spin structures for high spin fermions has already been illustrated in the cases of spin-@xmath16 fermions @xcite@xcite , spin-@xmath17 @xmath13k experiments@xcite , and alkali earth fermions with su@xmath18 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the case of spin-3/2 fermions is very illuminating . by simply changing the spin value from 1/2 to 3/2",
    ", the system immediately gains a rich so@xmath19 symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we shall discuss the spin structure of spin-@xmath0 fermions in the normal state by analyzing their single particle density matrices .",
    "we shall show that these density matrices can be decomposed into different angular momentum components , @xmath20 made up of a particle and a hole .",
    "we then show that each @xmath5-component can be represented by @xmath5 pairs of antipodal points ( or majorana points ) on a sphere . from the single particle density matrix",
    ", one can see that the @xmath21 component is the average density , and the @xmath22 components describe the spin structure of the system . the entire spin structure",
    "is then specified by a sequence of @xmath1 spheres with @xmath23 pairs of antipodal majorana points respectively . to illustrate the special properties of these spin structures",
    ", we shall study the class of inert states @xcite which are robust against perturbations .",
    "we show that many of these inert states have the symmetry of platonic solids and will have non - abelian line defects .",
    "furthermore , we shall perform mean field calculations to demonstrate the emergence of some of these inert states .",
    "for spin-@xmath0 bosons , its condensate ( known as spinor condensates ) is a @xmath24 component vector @xmath25 , @xmath26@xcite , where @xmath27 is the field operator that destroys a particle with spin component @xmath28 . for fermion superfluids made up of pairs of total angular momentum @xmath29 , its order parameter also transforms like that of a spin-@xmath29 spinor condensate@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the local spin order of a fermi gas , which is contained in the single particle density matrix @xmath30 , @xmath31 for large spin systems where dipolar effects are important , @xmath32 can acquire spatial variations even in equilibrium . for simplicity , we shall from now on suppress the spatial coordinate until they need to be made explicit .    under a spin rotation @xmath33 , the field operator and the density matrix transform as @xmath34 where",

    ", we decompose it in terms of tensor operators of different angular momenta ( made up of a particle - hole pair ) .",
    "this is achieved by noting that the @xmath41 matrix , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the clebsch - gordon coefficient , transforms under rotation as @xmath44 thus , @xmath45 is a tensor operator @xcite ( with angular momentum @xmath5 ) in the spin-@xmath0 space .",
    "we can then expand @xmath40 as @xmath46    to simplify notation , we will sometimes omit the indices @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath40 , and treat these matrices as @xmath49 and @xmath32 .",
    "since the clebsch - gordon coefficients are real numbers , so is @xmath48 .",
    "that means @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 means hermitian conjugate and transpose of the matrix . since the clebsch - gordon coefficients satisfies @xcite , @xmath53 we have @xmath54 from the rotational properties in eqn ( [ rho - trans ] ) and ( [ y - trans ] ) , it is easy to show that the vector @xmath55 transforms as a spin-@xmath5 vector in spin space , @xmath56 another convenient way to represent this transformation property is to regard @xmath57 s as the expansion coefficients of a abstract spin state @xmath58 in the angular momentum basis @xmath59 , latexmath:[\\[\\label{sector }    rotation property of @xmath58 immediately gives eqn.([rot - pro ] ) .",

    ", one sees from equation ( [ baral ] ) that @xmath257 will be maximized if the sign of @xmath160 matches that of the racah coefficient @xmath259 . to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we consider a set of @xmath160 s with the same magnitude @xmath260 with a sign matching that of @xmath261 .",
    "equation ( [ tc ] ) then becomes @xmath262 this condition is plotted in figure 2 for a spin @xmath14 fermi gas .",
    "it shows spin orders as high as @xmath263 can emerge at the phase boundary for @xmath264 . while equation ( [ newtc ] ) is sufficient for the appearance of @xmath62 , it is not necessary . once a low order @xmath62 is present , say , @xmath104 , higher @xmath5 spin order can emerge through non - linear coupling as temperature is lowered .",
    "finally , we note from eqn.([newtc ] ) that the larger the spin @xmath0 of the fermions , the larger the sum in eqn.([newtc ] ) , and the smaller the gas parameter @xmath265 needed to activate the spin order .",
    "since the diagonal element of the density matrix is the spin population along a specified spin quantization axis , say @xmath266 , they can be determined by the stern - gerlach method . to access the off diagonal elements",
    ", one can apply a magnetic pulse to rotate @xmath32 to @xmath267 , where @xmath268 is a rotational matrix , see eqn.([rho - trans ] ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath269 will then contain information of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath32 due to the rotation @xmath268 . by repeating the measurement of diagonal matrix elements for different @xmath268 s",
    ", one can then extract the information of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the original density matrix @xmath32 .",
    "large spin quantum gases are fertile grounds for new quantum matter . here , we have pointed out the very rich spin order possible in large spin fermions , most of which have no analog in electron matters . we show that the spin order in different sectors can be conveniently described as majorana antipodal points on a sequence of spheres representing the spin order of different particle - hole angular momenta .",
    "our model calculations show that some of these orders can take the form of platonic solids , which are structures that exist within certain _ region _ of the parameter space instead of a single point .",
    "these structures are therefore robust and will have good chance to be realized .",
