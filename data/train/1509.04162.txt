    "recently , several vector - tensor ( vt ) theories involving a vector field , @xmath1 , and the metric tensor @xmath2 have been applied to cosmology @xcite ; in these theories , the background energy density , @xmath3 , of the vector field @xmath1 plays the role of the dark energy ( hereafter the subscript @xmath4 stands for background ) ; for example , in @xcite , where the theory of gravitation considered in this paper was proposed , the equation of state is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure due to the field @xmath1 and @xmath7 ; hence , the constant energy @xmath8 plays the role of vacuum energy .",

    "was obtained by using the well - known bardeen formalism @xcite to write the evolution equations of the scalar linear perturbations in vt theory , and also to find the initial conditions at high redshift necessary to solve these equations [ see @xcite ] . by using these elements , a modified version of the code cosmomc @xcite based on statistical techniques as the markov chains  was designed to fit the vt predictions with the observational data mentioned above . a model involving seven free cosmological parameters",
    "results were encouraging @xcite and the theory deserves attention .    before writing any field or cosmological equation , let us fix some notation criteria .",

    "the two vt theories mentioned above correspond to different choices of the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 involved in the action @xcite : @xmath36 where the tensor @xmath15 defined above is not the electromagnetic one . the vt theory studied in this paper",
    "[ see @xcite ] corresponds to the following choice of the free dimensionless parameters involved in action ( [ 1.1 ] ) : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in this theory of gravitation , it has been proved that there are no ghosts and unstable modes for @xmath39 . moreover , for a homogeneous and isotropic robertson - walker background universe , the energy density of the vector field @xmath3 has been proved to be @xmath40 where @xmath41 . therefore , constant @xmath42 must be positive to have @xmath43 .",
    "the vector field equations , when applied to robertson - walker cosmology , predict a constant value for @xmath44 and , consequently , @xmath3 is strictly constant as the vacuum energy density .",
    "the viability of vt as a theory of gravitation and its cosmological success require @xmath42 and @xmath45 parameters satisfying the inequalities @xmath46 , but their values can not be fixed .",
    "in this situation , it is worthwhile the design of new applications of the vt theory with the essential aim of fixing @xmath42 and @xmath45 and any other arbitrary quantity related with our limited knowledge of the @xmath1 nature and properties , which are being analyzed .",

    ", our attention is focused on the simplest of these problems : the study of the vt horizons of outer ( no matter content ) spherically symmetric stationary space - times , which are fully characterized by the mass @xmath47 ( no electrical charge and rotation ) and the cosmological constant @xmath48 .    according to its formulation ,",
    "vt is a theory of pure gravitation .",

    "the u(1 ) gauge symmetry of maxwell theory is not required in vt .",

    "is treated in the standard way ( minimal coupling with the gravitational part of the lagrangian ) .",
    "in other theories the action is designed to describe both the gravitational and the electromagnetic fields ; interesting cases may be found , e.g. , in @xcite , where non - minimal couplings of the electromagnetic field with gravity are proposed . a very promising non - minimal coupling between the electromagnetic field and a @xmath53 function",
    "is applied to cosmology in @xcite , where it is claimed that the theory is viable , and also that inflation and late time acceleration may be simultaneously explained . however , in vt theory , as well as in gr , it must be recognized that inflation is to be produced by additional fields .",
    "it is due to the fact that inflation must lead to an isotropic universe , whereas the inflation due to a vector field is expected to be anisotropic .",
    "only a triplet of orthogonal vector fields or n randomly oriented vector fields might produce an isotropic enough expansion @xcite , but this is not the case of the vt theory .    in order to explain inflation we could replace @xmath19 by an appropriated function @xmath50 in the lagrangian of the vt theory ; in this way , the field @xmath49 could explain the accelerated late time expansion , whereas the scalar field , associated to @xmath53 in the einstein frame , could account for the required inflation ; hence , function @xmath50 would be chosen to achieve a good inflation , without producing late time acceleration , which implies less restrictions to be satisfied by f(r ) .",

    "<S> a certain vector - tensor ( vt ) theory of gravitation was tested in previous papers . in the background universe </S>",
    "<S> , the vector field of the theory has a certain energy density , which is appropriate to play the role of vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this background and its perturbations may explain the temperature angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) obtained with wmap ( wilkinson map anisotropy probe ) , and other observations , as e.g. , the ia supernova luminosities . the parametrized post - newtonian limit of the vt theory has been proved to be identical to that of general relativity ( gr ) , and there are no quantum ghosts and classical instabilities . here , the stationary spherically symmetric solution , in the absence of any matter content , is derived and studied . </S>",
    "<S> the metric of this solution is formally identical to that of the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter solution of gr , but the role of the electrical charge is played by a certain quantity @xmath0 depending on both the vector field and the parameters of the vt theory . the black hole and cosmological horizons are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the vt black hole horizon deviates with respect to that of the kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter radius . </S>",
    "<S> realistic relative deviations depend on @xmath0 and reach maximum values close to 30 per cent . for large enough @xmath0 values </S>",
    "<S> , there is no any black hole horizon , but only a cosmological horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of this last horizon is almost independent of the mass source , the vector field components , and the vt parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it essentially depends on the cosmological constant value , which has been fixed by using cosmological observational data ( cmb anisotropy , galaxy correlations and so on ) . </S>"
