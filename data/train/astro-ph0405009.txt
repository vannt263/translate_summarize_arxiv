    "understanding the formation and evolution of disk galaxies is a crucial aspect of galaxy formation studies ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) .",
    "much of our knowledge about such disks is based upon detailed observations of the milky way , and in this regard , its globular clusters ( gcs ) have played a prominent role .",
    "the milky way possesses a retinue of @xmath8150 gcs which , while a minor contributer to the total mass budget of the galaxy ( they constitute some @xmath83@xmath910@xmath10 in total , or @xmath80.1% of the baryonic mass of the milky way ) , have proved invaluable for understanding its structure , stellar populations , and mass aggregation history ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "they comprise of at least two components , a spatially extended , metal - poor , pressure - supported system , and a metal - rich , centrally concentrated system which exhibits some rotation ( zinn 1985 ) .",
    "although initially thought to be associated with the thick disk ( zinn 1985 ) , the majority of these metal - rich clusters are now believed to be associated with the bulge ( frenk & white 1982 ; minitti 1995 ; cot@xmath11 1999 ; forbes , brodie & larsen 2001 ) .    to date , all the gcs in the galaxy for which detailed color - magnitude diagrams have been obtained appear old ( i.e. , @xmath28 gyr ) , although a subset of metal - rich gcs may be up to @xmath820% younger than the inner - halo gcs ( rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ; salaris & weiss 2002 ) .",
    "there is also evidence for a spread of ages among the outer - halo gcs , suggesting either a clumpy collapse ( searle & zinn 1978 ) or accreted origin ( e.g. , cot@xmath11 et al . 2000 ; bellazzini et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the significance of such accretions are currently the subject of much debate in light of the presently favored hierarchical clustering paradigm ( brook et al .",
    "2003 ; martin et al . 2004",
    "; forbes , strader & brodie 2004 ) .    notwithstanding our increasingly detailed knowledge regarding the milky way gc system ,",
    "surprisingly little is known about the gc systems of spiral galaxies in general .",
    "this is largely a result of the difficulties involved in observing what are relatively poor gc systems ( compared with luminous ellipticals ) , that are often projected against an inhomogeneous background .",
    "however , the gaps in our knowledge about the gc systems of external spirals is slowly changing , with increasingly detailed photometric ( e.g. , goudfrooij et al .",
    "2003 ; rhode 2003 ; chandar , whitmore & lee 2004 ) and spectroscopic studies ( chandar , bianchi & ford 1999 ; schroder et al . 2002 ; olsen et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in this regard , our close companion , the andromeda spiral ( m31 ; d@xmath8780 kpc , holland 1998 ; stanek & garnavich 1998 ) provides an important test - bed for the generality of any milky way formation theories .",
    "it is of similar hubble type ( sb ) to the milky way , although it is possibly less massive ( cot@xmath11 et al .",
    "2000 ; gottesman , hunter & boonysait 2002 ) .",
    "unlike the milky way , m31 appears to have a predominantly metal - rich stellar halo ( e.g. , holland , fahlman & richer 1996 ; bellazini et al .",
    "2003 ; rich et al . 2004 ) .",
    "m31 possesses the most populous gc system in the local group .",
    "van den bergh ( 1999 ) estimated a total gc system of 400 @xmath12 55 , which is at least a factor of two larger than that of the milky way .",
    "previous studies to catalog the m31 gc system have included sargent et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , battistini et al .",
    "( 1980 , 1987 , 1993 ) and crampton et al .",
    "recently , barmby et al . ( 2000 ) published a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic catalog of 435 gcs and gc candidates .",
    "these authors showed that the m31 gc system could be divided into metal - poor and metal - rich sub - populations , with their kinematics separating into halo and bulge / disk components similar to that of the milky way .",
    "perrett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained intermediate resolution spectra for a subset of @xmath8200 m31 clusters , offering a great improvement in velocity accuracy over previous efforts .",
    "this increase in accuracy lead a recent study by morrison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to kinematically identify what is possibly a _",
    "thin _ disk population of m31 gcs .",
    "such a system has not been observed in the milky way .",
    "van den bergh ( 1969 ) was the first to study the metallicity distributions of gcs in m31 , from integrated spectra and @xmath13 photometry obtained with the hale 200-inch .",
    "he concluded that on average , the m31 gc system was more metal - rich than both the milky way and fornax dwarf gc systems .",
    "in an important contribution , burstein et al . ( 1984 ) comprehensively discussed differences in the stellar content of gcs in the milky way and m31 . from integrated spectra , they found that at high metallicity , at a given metal - line strength the hydrogen lines ( specifically h@xmath5 ) of the m31 gcs were systematically stronger than their galactic counterparts .",
    "they explored a number of possible explanations for this phenomenon , and concluded that the most likely explanation was for an age difference in the gcs , in that the m31 gcs were systematically younger than the milky way s .",
    "they also found that cn in the intermediate- to metal - rich m31 gcs was significantly enhanced ( by several tenths of a magnitude ) when compared to elliptical galaxies .",
    "this cn enhancement could not be demonstrated at low metallicities .",
    "no satisfactory explanation which could explain both the cn anomaly and the enhanced balmer indices has been put forward .    in a series of papers brodie & huchra 1990 , 1991 ; huchra , brodie & kent 1991 ) investigated the metallicity and abundances of m31 gcs using a more extensive sample of integrated spectra .",
    "in general , they found that the properties of the m31 gc system were similar to those of the galactic system .",
    "notable exceptions were that the cn and h+k line - strengths were higher in the m31 gcs ( at a given metallicity ) than the galactic gcs , supporting the burstein et al .",
    "( 1984 ) findings .",
    "however , with the exception of a few individual cases , they saw no systematic evidence for an enhancement in h@xmath5 in m31 gcs .",
    "the cn enhancement in the m31 gcs is now reasonably well established ( trippico 1989 ; ponder et al .",
    "1998 ; li & burstein 2004 ) , whilst the differences in h@xmath5 are somewhat more controversial ( see trippico 1994 for a short review ) . however , it is important to note that in the above studies , the most metal - rich galactic gcs were not well represented , mostly due to the difficulty of observing these objects against the bright background presented by the galaxy . if metal - rich gcs are associated with spiral bulges ( frenk & white 1982 ; cot@xmath11 1999 ; forbes et al .",
    "2001 ) , then m31 s bulge , which is an order - of - magnitude more massive than that of the milky way should host many more metal - rich bulge gcs , resulting in an unequal comparison between the two gc populations ( see trager 2004 ) .    in this paper , we compare galactic gc data , which include a number of bulge gcs ( cohen , blakeslee , & rhyzhov 1998 ; puzia et al .",
    "2002 ) and newly analyzed spectroscopic data for m31 gcs in order to investigate some of these issues in detail . in a forthcoming paper ( beasley et al .",
    ", in preparation ( paper ii ) ) , we compare these full datasets to contemporary stellar population models in order to derive parameters such as metallicity , age and @xmath14-to - iron abundance ratios .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ data ] we discuss the samples under study and new data reduction steps required .",
    "next , details of the spectroscopic system are given in section  [ indices ] . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we look at the behavior of the balmer and cn indices of the gcs , compared to recent elliptical galaxy data . in section  [ secyoung ]",
    "we look in detail at eight young clusters in the m31 spectroscopic sample",
    ". finally , we present our discussion and conclusions in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the integrated spectra of m31 globular clusters used in this study were previously described in barmby et al .",
    "these authors obtained radial velocities for the clusters , and derived metallicities using the empirical calibrations of brodie & huchra ( 1990 ) .",
    "we have not used the mmt spectra described in barmby et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , since these spectra are generally of insufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for accurate line - strength analysis . in the following ,",
    "we describe this dataset , and outline the data reduction steps which differ from barmby et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    integrated spectra for 42 gc candidates in m31 were obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck - i telescope .",
    "the observations were undertaken in 1995 , september 21st-23rd , and in 1996 , december 8th , with some effort to obtain spectra of clusters in the central galactic regions of m31 .",
    "candidates were drawn from the catalog of barmby et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with the majority originating from the work of battistini et al . (",
    "integrations were typically 5 minutes per target , which with characteristic magnitudes of v@xmath817 , yielded spectra with s / n of 20  200 per resolution element .",
    "typical seeing was 1 arcsec during these observations , and the same 1 arcsec @xmath9 1.5 arcmin longslit was used for all clusters .",
    "a 600 line mm@xmath15 grating was used yielding a 1.2    pixel@xmath15 dispersion , and a full - width , half - maximum resolution ( fwhm ) of 5   .",
    "this resolution was determined from measuring a series of isolated arc - lines in the comparison lamp spectra , and found to be constant over our spectral range 36706200   .",
    "the data reduction steps of bias subtraction , flat - fielding and sky - subtraction were performed using standard packages in @xmath16 . the spectra were wavelength calibrated using arc lamp spectra , covering the full spectral range , which were interspersed amongst the m31 observations .",
    "the accuracy of the relative flux calibrations of the spectra can have a significant impact on the measurement of certain broad line - strength indices .",
    "for these data , this is true of the lick cn@xmath17 , cn@xmath18 , mg@xmath17 , mg@xmath18 and tio@xmath17 indices . for the present study , the original un - flux calibrated spectra from barmby et al .",
    "have been re - fluxed using a larger series of flux standards taken during the time of the lris observations .",
    "these flux standards , bd+28@xmath194211 , bd+25@xmath194655 , feige 110 and gd 50 were all selected from the faint spectrophotometric standard star list of oke ( 1990 ) .",
    "the standards were all taken with the same slit size ( 1 arcsec @xmath9 1.5 arcsec ) as the program observations , and covered a range of airmasses .",
    "in general , the new flux calibrations agree to within @xmath810% of the old calibrations .",
    "however , we do observe significant differences in the spectra which exhibit earlier spectral - types ( see section  [ secyoung ] ) , which we attribute to differences in airmass between the original flux standards and the program clusters .",
    "the following analysis is based on the newly flux - calibrated m31 data .",
    "reliable line - strength measurements require a s / n such that the index and pseudo - continuum are well defined .",
    "therefore , we have focused on a high s / n ( @xmath230 pixel@xmath15 ) subset of these data . from 42 spectra of candidate m31 gcs , 36 are of sufficient s / n for a detailed analysis of their line - strength indices .",
    "five clusters , all drawn from the near - nucleus cluster catalog of battistini et al . (",
    "1993 ) , we have identified as being likely foreground g - dwarfs of the basis of their spectra .",
    "these objects exhibit weak cn and tio molecular bands , closely following the dwarf sequences of the lick stellar library , rather than that of the majority of the m31 gcs and lick giants .",
    "moreover , a measure of their surface gravities based upon the srii / fei diagnostic ( rose 1985 ) places them clearly on the locus of lick dwarfs , rather than that of a dwarf - giant mix expected for gcs ( tripicco 1989 ) .",
    "this places them at the lower - velocity end of the m31 gc velocity distribution , which has a maximum - likelihood systemic velocity of 284@xmath129 kms@xmath15 , and an overall velocity dispersion of 156@xmath126 kms@xmath15 ( perrett et al .",
    "2002 ) . ] .",
    "these objects ( nb  68 , nb  74 , nb  81 , nb  87 and nb  91 ) were removed from the sample .",
    "the basic data for all the m31 clusters which satisfy our s / n and star cluster criteria are listed in table  [ basicdata ] .",
    "the spatial distribution of the sample with respect to m31 is shown in figure  [ spatial ] .    to anticipate some of the results of this study , spectra for eight of the m31 gc candidates have spectral characteristics typical of young stellar populations or a - f stars ; weak metal - lines , relatively strong absorption in the hydrogen balmer lines and relatively blue continua when compared to classical g or k - type gc spectra .",
    "these are discussed separately in section  [ secyoung ] and not included in the main analysis .",
    "galactic gcs play a vital role in the interpretation of the integrated light of more distant gc systems .",
    "they not only allow for direct comparative studies , but also provide important benchmarks for stellar population models since they generally have independently derived ages , metallicities and often , heavy - element abundance ratios .",
    "increasingly , high - quality integrated spectra for galactic gcs are appearing in the literature , and we make use of two such studies",
    ".    cohen et al . (",
    "1998 ; henceforth cbr98 ) obtained lris long - slit spectra for 12 galactic gcs in order to compare with their multi - slit m87 gc data .",
    "these spectra were obtained by scanning @xmath890 arcsec across the cores of the galactic gcs in order to synthesize a larger aperture , and thus obtain a representative integrated spectrum .",
    "these data are all of high s / n , but were taken using differing grating angles yielding 6 spectra with wavelength ranges in the interval 3800  6500   , and 6 spectra slightly shifted to the red , with wavelength ranges of 4500  7200   . the lris 600 lines mm@xmath15 grating used yielded a dispersion of 1.2    pixel@xmath15 , and resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath86   .",
    "cbr98 did not flux - calibrate these data , and measured indices by individually shifting each index to its rest wavelength .",
    "we elected to derive new wavelength solutions for the 12 spectra ( kindly provided by j. cohen and j blakeslee , see beasley et al .",
    "2004 ) by comparing the central index positions in these spectra with known wavelengths from our present m31 data , and galactic gc data from puzia et al .",
    "we have also performed a first - order flux calibration to the spectra using the sensitivity functions derived from our long - slit lris data using a similar instrumental set - up .",
    "puzia et al .",
    "( 2002 ; henceforth p02 ) have presented high - quality integrated spectra for 12 galactic gcs , with the inclusion of a number of bulge clusters .",
    "their sample also contains an integrated spectrum of the outer bulge of the galaxy .",
    "these authors obtained fixed - position ( i.e. not drift - scanned ) spectra with different pointings ( see p02 ) using the boller & chivens spectrograph at the eso 1.52 m at la silla .",
    "a 600 lines mm@xmath15 grating gave 1.89    pixel@xmath15 , with a fixed 3 arcsec slit yielding a resolution of @xmath86.7   .",
    "four of the gcs in the p02 sample are in common with those in the cbr98 sample , namely ngc  6356 , ngc  6528 , ngc  6553 and ngc  6624 , resulting in a total of 20 unique gcs for our analysis .",
    "these four common clusters between the cbr98 and p02 datasets have allowed us to examine any systematic offsets between these data , in addition to estimating the true uncertainties in the cbr98 data ( section  [ indices ] ) .",
    "we have chosen to investigate the chemical properties of the m31 and galactic globular clusters using the line - strength indices defined by the lick group ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; trager et al . 1998 ) . for the following discussion ,",
    "we first draw a clear distinction between the lick @xmath20 and the lick @xmath21 .",
    "lick _ indices _ now describe a set of 25 indices ( see trager et al .",
    "1998 and worthey & ottaviani 1997 for the latest definitions ) which are defined by two central feature bandpasses , and four pseudo - continuum bandpasses ( a total of six bandpasses , or wavelengths ) .",
    "however , the lick _ system _ refers to lick indices which are measured on spectra which match ( or mimic ) the behavior of the mildly non - linear and un - flux calibrated lick / image dissector scanner ( lick / ids ) .",
    "this is achieved by virtue of either the spectra having been acquired with the lick / ids , or by calibrating onto the lick / ids system by matching its resolution and correcting for systematic offsets through observing sufficient lick standard stars .",
    "the advantages in using the lick system and indices are that they are widely used by galactic and globular cluster researchers , and that an extensive stellar library exists for the construction of stellar population models ( e.g. , worthey et al .",
    "important drawbacks are that calibrating non - lick / ids data onto the lick system can be difficult , generally requiring many observations of standard stars , and that data of higher resolution than that of the lick library ( 811   ) , must be degraded to this resolution , potentially losing important information .    in principle",
    ", line - strength indices measured on flux - calibrated spectra obtained with modern spectrographs and linear detectors should be well reproducible , providing these data are at the same resolution ( e.g. , vazdekis 1999 ) .",
    "for the case of spectra with good sky - subtraction and flat - fielding , no systematic offsets should be observed between measurements of common objects , with the scatter entirely reflecting the random uncertainties between the two observations .",
    "therefore , we have chosen not to correct these data to the lick system , but compare the cbr98 , m31 and p02 data at the lick resolution .",
    "note for the p02 data , we have de - licked these indices using the values given in p02 . however , for comparison with stellar population models based upon the worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) lick fitting functions , correction to the lick system is a requirement .",
    "we determine these corrections in section  [ lickcorrections ] .    to match the lick / ids resolution , the cbr98 and m31 data have been smoothed with a wavelength - dependent gaussian kernel based on the known variation of fwhm with wavelength of the lick / ids given in worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "these m31 data were then shifted to the rest - frame using the velocities given in barmby et al .",
    "this shift was unnecessary for the cbr98 data since they were wavelength calibrated in the rest - frame ( section  [ galacticglobs ] ) .",
    "cbr98 originally measured a subset of lick indices from their spectra using the original index definitions of burstein et al .",
    "for these re - calibrated cbr98 data , we have measured lick indices using the updated definitions in trager et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and worthey & ottaviani ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that the differing grating angles used in these observations ( section  [ galacticglobs ] ) yielded different spectral ranges , resulting in 6 clusters which do not have measured indices blueward of 4500    ( c@xmath18 4668 ) .",
    "all the measured lick indices which fall within the spectral range are given in table  [ cbr98indices ] .",
    "due to the high s / n nature of these spectra , photon statistical errors generally underestimate the real uncertainty in the lick indices measured .",
    "since we have no repeat observations of these clusters with which to determine our repeatability , we have estimated the uncertainty in each index by comparing our measured lick indices with four gcs which are in common with the p02 sample .",
    "we determine the rms difference between each lick index to yield @xmath22 .",
    "the mean difference and @xmath22 for each index between the common clusters are listed in table  [ galacticoffsets ] .",
    "unfortunately , only one of the galactic clusters common between the cbr98 and p02 datasets ( ngc  6356 ) includes all the blue indices in the cbr98 spectrum .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 for indices h@xmath23 through to fe4531 was taken to be the absolute difference between the measurement .",
    "the shot - noise uncertainties for these data were determined using the method described by cardiel ( 1998 ) , which we denote @xmath24 , yielding a total error : @xmath25 .",
    "values of @xmath26 are also given in alternate rows in table  [ cbr98indices ] .",
    "as can be seen , in general the agreement between the two datasets is good and offsets between the cbr98 and p02 data are small .",
    "this is true for the most important indices ( e.g. , cn , mg@xmath18 , mg @xmath27 , fe5270 , fe5335 ) .",
    "we see significant offsets in g4300 , h@xmath28 , c@xmath184668 and fe5015 .",
    "the reason for these differences is unclear , however we note that the lick correction employed by p02 for these indices ( which we have de - corrected these indices by ) are significant .    for the m31 data ,",
    "twenty - four lick indices were measured from h@xmath29 ( the bluest ) to tio@xmath17 ( the reddest ) as defined in trager et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and worthey & ottaviani ( 1998 ) .",
    "we were unable to measure tio@xmath18 since this index extends beyond our red wavelength limit .",
    "these indices are tabulated in table  [ m31indices ] .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainties in these data by comparing clusters in common between the two observing runs .",
    "there are three clusters in common which are commonly used as velocity standards : 158 - 213 , 163 - 217 and 225 - 280 ( using the nomenclature of huchra , brodie & kent 1991 ) , and we have taken the rms , @xmath22 , between index measurements of these clusters as an estimate of our repeatability .",
    "this method worked well for most indices , and any systematic offsets were generally small .",
    "the exceptions to this were h@xmath29 and nad which both showed rather large offsets between the 1995 , december and 1996 , september runs ( 0.4    and 0.5    respectively ) for reasons that remain unclear . in view of this",
    "we assigned rms s of 0.4    and 0.5    respectively , and note that these are problematic indices .",
    "poisson ( shot - noise ) errors ( @xmath24 ) were calculated as for the cbr98 data .",
    "values of @xmath26 are given in alternate rows in table  [ m31indices ] .",

    "whilst there does appear to be a mild enhancement in several clusters at [ mgfe]@xmath82 , which is most pronounced in their h@xmath28 and h@xmath37 indices , this is not particularly significant since there are two galactic gcs ( ngc  6388 and ngc  6637 ) at this metallicity which differ by @xmath80.4    in h@xmath5 ; ngc  6388 lies squarely amongst these m31 clusters .",

    "this difference of 0.43    in h@xmath5 is close to the dispersion in the metal - poor m31 clusters alone .",

    "the lack of obvious enhancement in the cn@xmath17 and cn@xmath18 indices between the galactic and m31 clusters probably reflects the relatively low sensitivities of these indices to cn , when compared to cnb , rather than any systematic offset between these data ( see trager ( 2004 ) for a discussion of this issue ) .",

    "to conclude , we obtain an age - determination for hubble v of 100500 myr , in good agreement with previous determinations , under the assumptions that the chemical composition of the young m31 clusters ( metallicity , abundance ratios ) are similar to those of the lmc system .",
    "we have performed the previous exercise for the remaining young m31 spectra , each time choosing the three closest cross - correlation templates to the cluster in question .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ crosscorrtab ] . according to the lmc templates , the m31 clusters span a significant range of ages from between 1030 myr ( 327 - 053 ) up to 0.82 gyr ( 292 - 010 ) .",
    "the relative age rankings are qualitatively supported by the appearance of the cluster spectra in figure  [ youngspectra ] .",
    "we now appeal to the predictions of stellar population models for more information regarding these objects . to estimate the cluster ages and metallicities we have employed the evolutionary population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; hereafter bc03 ) . in the optical range which we are interested in ( 36706200   ) , the bc03 models employ the recent stellar library ( stelib ) of le borgne et al.(2003 ) .",
    "the library , which consists of 249 stars taken at a resolution of 3    ( fwhm ) , covers with varying degrees of completeness the metallicity range 2.0 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 + 0.50 , luminosity classes i to v , and spectral types o5 to m9 .",
    "perhaps the most serious limitation of these ( and other ) models for our purposes is the lack of hot stars ( @xmath49 10,000 k ) at non - solar metallicities .",
    "this , however , should not be too problematic since we expect the abundances of the young m31 clusters to be at or near solar metallicity .",
    "we show in figure  11 the evolution of the lick - defined h@xmath5 index as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "the models shown adopt the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , with a lower mass cut - off of 0.1@xmath43 and upper mass cut - off of 100@xmath43 .",
    "the use of a salpeter imf has small effect on the optical indices in question here ( bc03 ) . according to the bc03 models , the h@xmath5 index increased rapidly with time until @xmath8300 myr , as turn - off",
    "a - stars come to dominate the integrated light .",
    "the strength of the index then decreases monotonically with age . in this regime",
    ", age is the single - most important influence on this index , whereas metallicity is a significant , but less important contributer .",
    "we have plotted our h@xmath5 measurements for the eight young clusters in figure  11 , which range from 3.12  6.83   . in themselves , these suggest an age range between 0.025 gyr .",
    "the higher - order balmer lines show very similar behavior to that of h@xmath5 .    as has been noted before , the relatively narrow definition of the lick h@xmath5 index is not particularly well suited for very young stellar populations ( e.g. , larsen & brodie 2002 ) . however , we do not rely solely on the balmer lines for age discrimination . following the method outlined in proctor et al . (",
    "2004 ) , we have determined the ages and metallicities of the clusters by fitting all our measured lick indices to the predictions of the bc03 models . using the entire set of lick indices",
    "maximizes the amount of age and metallicity information present in the spectra , since each index is individually sensitive to age and metallicity ( and chemical abundance ratio variations ; proctor & sansom 2002 ) .",
    "this approach is particularly useful in this case since in these young clusters the metal - lines are extremely diluted .",
    "bc03 provide lick indices for their model seds which cover the age - range 0.125 myr  20 gyr , and a metallicity range of 0.0001  0.05 @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", we use lick indices measured off the bc03 seds , not those derived using the lick fitting functions since our data is not corrected to the lick system . as is the case for the lick stellar library",
    ", the stelib library is based on solar neighborhood stars . as such",
    ", it reflects the solar neighborhood abundance pattern .",
    "this creates an abundance ratio bias which is implicit in stellar population models which employ empirical stellar libraries ( trager et al .",
    "2000 ; thomas & maraston 2002 ; proctor & sansom 2002 ) . for very young systems correcting for this bias is highly uncertain , and therefore we make no correction to the bc03 models .",
    "this should not introduce serious errors in our derived abundances near to solar metallicity ( proctor et al .",
    "2004 ) .    for each cluster ,",
    "we perform a @xmath51 fit of all our measured indices to each combination of age and metallicity in the bc03 models .",
    "the age and metallicity of the model which is best found to fit these data are then adopted as the best age and metallicity estimate of the particular cluster in question . for detailed discussions of the method applied to galaxy spectra see proctor & sansom ( 2002 ) and proctor et al .",
    "the results of our @xmath51 analysis are given in table  [ chitab ] , and we show the age - metallicity relation for these clusters in figure  12 . for comparison , we have also performed the same analysis for a subset of the beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) lmc clusters .",
    "the majority of the ages derived from the bc03 models are consistent with those obtained from the lmc cluster templates .",
    "however , the bc03 models do generally predict older ages than these templates .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the lmc templates are somewhat more metal - poor than the young m31 clusters . for hubble",
    "v , we obtain an age of 0.51@xmath120.59 gyr , which is consistent with previous studies ( da costa & mould 1988 ; lee 1996 ) .",
    "figure  12 shows that , with the exception of 292 - 010 , all of the young clusters are less than 1 gyr old , and are very close to solar metallicity .",
    "cluster 292 - 010 appears to be closer to 3 gyr old , and is also somewhat more metal - poor .",
    "we conclude that our age determinations are in reasonable accord with the lmc templates , and henceforth we adopt the age and metallicity estimates for the young clusters based on the bc03 models which are given in table  [ chitab ] .",
    "we are now in a position to estimate the masses of the clusters .",
    "we have de - reddened the v - band apparent magnitudes of the clusters using the mean reddening , e(b ",

    "( 2000 ) and adopting @xmath52 ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) . assuming a distance modulus to m31 of @xmath53=24.47 ( holland 1998 ; staneck & garnavich 1998 )",
    ", we obtain absolute magnitudes , and hence total v - band luminosities for the clusters .",
    "@xmath54 ratios for the clusters come from bc03 , based upon our bc03 age determinations .",
    "this has the benefit of adding internal consistency to our calculations . in table",
    "[ chitab ] we list the adopted @xmath54 ratios and estimated masses for the young m31 clusters . estimating the uncertainties in our mass determinations is difficult , a major contribution to the error budget is the unknown reddening in the disk of m31 .",
    "an increase in our adopted mean reddening by a factor of 2 ( e(b  v)=0.44 ) would roughly increase our mass estimate by the same factor .",
    "an adopted factor of 2 uncertainty in the values given in table  [ chitab ] is not unreasonable .",
    "the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf used in the bc03 models predicts that aging these clusters to @xmath813 gyr will result in their fading by up to four magnitudes .",
    "given their current absolute magnitude range of 8.57 @xmath55 7.24 , this will result in clusters with 4.57 @xmath55 3.24 , which is some four magnitudes fainter than the peak of the galactic gc luminosity function .",
    "a further consideration in this mass calculation is the effect of dynamical evolution , both internal and external to the clusters ( e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "several effects are expected to occur on different time - scales which will act to lower the cluster masses . for ages",
    "@xmath56 years , stellar winds and supernovae will remove some @xmath8 30% of the initial mass from a cluster , whereas for clusters older than this , two - body relaxation , bulge and/or disk shocking and dynamical friction will all act upon the clusters to varying degrees .",
    "the survival of galactic _",
    "open _ clusters ( ocs ) at a given mass depends crucially upon their linear size ( wielen 1971 ) .",
    "massive , but small clusters , will feel the effects of dynamical relaxation most strongly , whereas more extended clusters will be more susceptible to the effects of the galaxian tidal field . for the m31 clusters in question , with masses @xmath57 , we expect two - body relaxation to be the primary source of mass evolution ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . obtaining structural parameters for",
    "these clusters will shed light on this important issue .",
    "suffice to say that our mass estimates do not correct for any dynamical evolution .",
    "the cluster masses and faded absolute magnitudes we derive are relatively modest in gc terms .",
    "some 90% of the galactic gc system have masses @xmath58 .",
    "the only cluster in the sample that lies in this gc mass regime is the slightly older , more metal - poor 292 - 010 , which lies out of the plane of the disk ( see later ) . for reference , one of the least massive gcs known in the galaxy is am-4 , which has an absolute magnitude , @xmath59=1.24 .",
    "assuming @xmath54=2 for an old stellar population , we obtain a mass of @xmath60 for this cluster .    an important question here is whether these are actually young gcs , ocs , or lie somewhere else in the mass spectrum of star clusters .",
    "after larsen & richtler ( 1999 ) , in figure  13 we plot the young m31 clusters in the @xmath59age plane compared to the galactic oc catalogue of lyng  ( 1987 ) , and the young , massive clusters ( ymcs ) identified in a sample of nearby spirals by larsen & richtler ( 1999 ) .",
    "the comparison between the young m31 clusters , the ocs and ymcs is not strictly fair for two reasons .",
    "firstly , ages are derived for these latter two cluster types using integrated colors , whereas the m31 clusters have spectroscopically derived ages .",
    "secondly , and perhaps more importantly , the selection functions of the three cluster types are very different .",
    "however , figure  13 is revealing .",
    "the galactic ocs from lyng  ( 1987 ) are rather well bounded by the bc03 models for @xmath61 at solar metallicity .",
    "very few are found to lie above this mass for the chabrier imf . with the exception of 327 - 053 ,",
    "all the m31 clusters are well separated from the upper envelope of the galactic ocs .",
    "in fact , the m31 clusters roughly cover the mass range of larsen & richtler s ( 1999 ) ymcs , although are somewhat older .",
    "this is probably not a real effect , but reflects a bias in the larsen & richtler sample in that they preferentially obtained data for the bright end of the ymc luminosity function , which are intrinsically younger ymcs .",
    "also in figure  13 we show the position of a gc at the turnover of the gclf ( @xmath62 ) , with an observed dispersion of 1.2 mag . as the young m31 clusters fade and follow the locus of the models",
    ", they will occupy an area slighly below this region , between the gcs and ocs . therefore , at present , we can not say for certain whether we are seeing massive ocs , or relatively low - mass gcs .",
    "high - resolution imaging , and dynamical mass estimates will distinguish between these two possibilities .    with the exceptions of hubble",

    "morrison et al . ( 2004 ) argued that , although they had no secure age estimates for these disk clusters , the fact that the disk clusters extend down to such low metallicities was indicative that the thin disk of m31 was likely to be old ( @xmath8 10 gyr ) .",
    "four of the six disk clusters in our sample are included in the morrison et al .",
    "( 2004 ) study , namely 314 - 037 , 321 - 046 , 327 - 053 and 380 - 313 .",

    "these are consistent with their definition of belonging to a thin disk population , and indeed these clusters lie near the rotation curves shown in figure  14 .",

    "we suggest that age - metallicity degeneracy , and the lack of balmer lines in the perrett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) spectra , lead these authors to conclude incorrectly these were metal - poor rather than young objects .",
    "a full census of the ages of these disk clusters is required to investigate this point .",

    "we have shown that this remains true for gcs in the range 1.5 @xmath6 [ fe / h ] @xmath6 0.3 ( the metallicity range of the milky way gcs in our sample ) . moreover , both the m31 and milky way gcs are enhanced in cn when compared to elliptical galaxies , which themselves show differences when divided into field and cluster samples ( s@xmath30nchez - bl@xmath30zquez et al .",
    "the very existence of cn variations suggest than n is the main culprit , since c is expected to be effectively absorbed into the co molecule .",

    "a better understanding of the behavior of c and o in gcs may benefit from a comprehensive study of the co feature at 2.3@xmath53 m ( e.g. , davidge 1990 ) .",
    "varying cn enhancements in the _ integrated _ spectra of galactic and m31 clusters is particularly interesting when one considers the cn variations known to exist between stars in individual galactic globulars .",
    "the best documented case is that of 47 tucanae .",
    "norris & freeman ( 1979 ) found that the giants in this cluster exhibited cn - strong and cn - weak bimodality from the cn molecular band at @xmath414150   .",
    "this bimodality has since been observed to several magnitudes below the main sequence turn - off in galactic gcs , along with the discovery that cn and ch are anti - correlated as expected from the cno cycle ( e.g. , cannon et al .",
    "1998 ; gratton et al .",

    "although no such studies exist for the much more distant m31 gcs , tripicco ( 1989 ) and tripico & bell ( 1992 ) , showed that , on the basis of near - uv integrated spectroscopy and synthetic spectra , cn enhancement in the m31 gcs likely arises from cn - strong giants _ and _ cn - strong dwarfs . thus , the luminosity dependence of cn appears to exist in m31 gcs as well as milky way clusters .    as discussed comprehensively by cannon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and summarized by harbeck et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , three scenarios have been discussed to explain these puzzling chemical inhomogeneities ; internal evolution of gc stars , gc self - pollution from evolved stars and primordial differences or gc self - enrichment .",
    "both the internal evolution and gc self - pollution scenarios have difficulty explaining the observed bimodality in cn in general , and its existence well below the main - sequence turn - off in gcs .",
    "cno variations are expected to occur on the giant branch from standard mixing theory , where the convective envelope reaches it closest penetration to the cno burning shell .",
    "however , this is not expected in stars well below the main - sequence turn - off , which are not expect to undergo deep mixing ( renzini & voli 1981 ) .",
    "self - pollution from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are expected to eject cno products through stellar winds , which may be deposited upon the rest of the stars in the cluster ( ventura et al .",
    "however , such accreted material is expected to be diluted in red giant branch ( rgb ) stars which undergo deep mixing .",
    "this is generally not observed , except possibly in a few metal - poor gcs ( suntzeff 1981 ; carbon et al .",
    "1982 ) .",
    "the primordial scenario argues that the proto - globular clouds had a range of chemical compositions , and a collision between two such clouds may result in the observed bimodality , if the gas remained unmixed prior to the onset of star formation . this picture is not unreasonable in an early proto - galactic environment , when the cross - section of cloud - cloud collisions is expected to be high ( bekki et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , this scenario faces the constraint in that the iron - peak elements show very little dispersion in individual gcs ( e.g. kraft 1994 ) .",
    "all of the m31 gcs in our sample have similar metallicities and luminosities to their galactic counterparts , and lie on the same fundamental plane ( barmby , holland & huchra 2002 ) .",
    "these clusters are enhanced in cn with respect to the milky way gcs , which themselves show cluster to cluster variations ( cannon et al .",
    "it seems unlikely that internal - evolution or self - pollution would operate preferentially in the m31 gcs , but not in milky way clusters , particularly since the m31 gc dwarfs are likely cn - strong ( tripicco & bell 1992 ; li & burstein 2004 ) . unless there are significant age differences between the milky way gcs and all the m31 clusters in our sample ( which we have not observed , paper ii )",
    ", it seems highly likely that the source of the cn enhancement was external to the m31 cluster system .",
    "although highly speculative , we are forced to conclude that the nitrogen enhancement in m31 gcs must be primordial in origin .",
    "the m31 proto - globular clouds were presumably enriched in nitrogen at some early epoch , whereas the proto - globular clouds of the milky way gcs were not .",
    "much of the remaining nitrogen - rich material must have become incorporated into the bulk of the galaxy itself , although the m31 bulge shows significantly lower cn than the m31 gcs . with the advent of larger aperture telescopes , fine abundance analysis of individual halo stars in m31",
    "would be extremely interesting in this regard .",
    "six of the young clusters in our sample appear to be disk clusters .",
    "they are projected on to the m31 disk , appear to rotate with the h@xmath63 gas , and have approximately solar metallicities .",
    "interestingly , one non - disk cluster appears to be somewhat older ( @xmath83 gyr ) , and lies approximately 7 kpc away from the plane of the disk .",
    "on the basis of our mass estimates , it is presently not clear whether these objects are true gcs .",
    "provided that they survive the dual effects of the tidal field of m31 , and two - body relaxation , they will possibly evolve to populate the fainter end of the gclf , or populate the bright end of the oclf .",
    "are these clusters unusual ?",
    "the work of larsen & richtler ( 1999 , 2000 ) highlighted the fact that young , massive clusters are actually a common feature of local spiral galaxies .",
    "the presence of young disk clusters in m31 is therefore not surprising .",
    "based on a sample of 31 nearby spirals , larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) found a correlation between the specific @xmath65-band ymc luminosity , @xmath66 , and the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the galaxies as traced by the far infrared luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to ask the question , where does m31 lie on this relation ? using equation ( 7 ) of larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) , based upon the far - infrared luminosity of m31",
    ", we obtain a normalised sfr for this galaxy of : @xmath67 . assuming that all the metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.0 ) disk clusters in the morrison et al .",

    "clearly the sample of m31 disk clusters is not complete , but these values suggest that m31 lies on the larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) relation , and in the reasonably low sfr , low @xmath66 regime ( see figures 3 & 5 of larsen & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "this lends support to the idea that these objects are not open clusters in m31 , and may represent the precursors of true thin disk globular clusters .",
    "a system of young disk globular clusters is not seen in the milky way , and if m31 is truly forming disk gcs then this has important implications for galaxy formation theories .",
    "gcs are thought to trace the early episodes of the collapse of their host galaxy ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ) as well as later accretion ( cot@xmath11 , marzke & west 1998 ) and galaxy merging ( ashman & zepf 1992 ) .",
    "our results suggest that gcs may also trace the build up of galaxy disks , both at the present epoch and at higher redshifts .",
    "indeed , the very existence of such disk clusters is expected on the basis that disks are where the majority of present - day star formation occurs .",
    "recent efforts to simulate gc formation in the cdm paradigm also identify that a large fraction of gcs are expected to form in disk - like structures at high redshift ( beasley et al .",
