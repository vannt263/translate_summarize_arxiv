    "recent advances in experimental and theoretical investigations of nuclear incompressibility have also enabled studies of the evolution of incompressibility in isotopic chains @xcite . as for many other structure phenomena , for instance the evolution of magic numbers @xcite ,",
    "a study of the isotopic dependence might provide a more general and deeper insight into the inner workings .",
    "it has recently been inferred that measurement of isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr ) may probe nuclear incompressibility in a range of low nucleonic densities , rather than exactly at saturation density @xcite .",
    "experiments on isotopic chains @xcite , possibly also extended to exotic nuclei @xcite , are therefore important for constraining the density dependence of the incompressibility .",
    "investigations of isotopic chains also enable studies of pairing and shell effects on incompressibility .",
    "it has been shown that one can not neglect the effect of shell closure on nuclear incompressibility , and pairing correlations affect the position of the gmr excitation energy @xcite .",
    "the effect of shell closure ( and therefore magicity ) on the incompressibility has been discussed in ref .",
    "however , there is a general consensus that pairing effects alone are not large enough to explain the available data @xcite .",
    "early microscopic studies of the nuclear incompressibility were carried out using skyrme effective forces .",
    "later , with the inclusion of relativistic mean field models , detailed comparisons between different model predictions led to the conclusion that the nuclear matter incompressibility extracted from e.g. @xmath0pb lies in the range @xmath1 240@xmath220 mev ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the remaining uncertainty reflects our incomplete understanding of the specific effects related to finite nuclei , and further justifies the need of studying extended isotopic chains .    the theoretical framework of energy density functionals ( edf ) @xcite is the tool of choice for a quantitative analysis of these phenomena .",
    "preliminary studies , undertaken in the 1980 s , analyzed the dependence of the nuclear incompressibility on mass number , but only four doubly magic nuclei were considered and it was suggested that the nuclear incompressibility is rather constant for heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "another aspect is that the occurrence of low - energy monopole strength in exotic nuclei has recently been predicted @xcite , and this might affect the nuclear incompressibility .",
    "more generally , the present study of extended isotopic chains could also be useful for the understanding of incompressibility in other fermionic systems , or for astrophysical processes such as core collapse supernovae .",
    "the use of both analytical and fully microscopic approaches will provide complementary information about the incompressibility in both stable and exotic nuclei .",
    "section [ analytic ] defines the analytical relations between the incompressibility and other relevant nuclear quantities .",
    "section [ micro ] compares the analytical results with the microscopic ones obtained using the edf framework .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we review the relations between the nuclear incompressibility k@xmath3 and the nucleonic kinetic energy in the following analytical models : infinite nuclear matter , fermi gas , and the harmonic oscillator .",
    "for instance , in the free fermi gas approach the incompressibility of the system is directly linked to the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "the incompressibility of a fermionic system composed of a particles is defined as the second derivative ( curvature ) of its energy with respect to the mean square radius at the minimum @xcite :    @xmath4    where the label @xmath5 indicates that the quantities are evaluated in the ground state . for the isoscalar monopole transition operator @xmath6 the dielectric theorem @xcite yields @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the inverse energy weighted sum rule , proportional to the polarizability of the system .",
    "the energy of the isoscalar gmr can be defined by the following relation @xcite : @xmath9 the moment @xmath10 is evaluated by the double commutator using the thouless theorem @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermion mass , that is , @xmath13 938 mev for the nucleon .",
    "( [ eq : katwo ] ) , ( [ eq : egsum ] ) and ( [ eq : m1 ] ) lead to @xcite : @xmath14      an analytical derivation of the nuclear incompressibility k@xmath3 in the nuclear matter , the fermi gas , and the harmonic oscillator models , will provide a complementary insight to the microscopic results of the next section .",
    "let us first consider infinite homogeneous nuclear matter .",
    "the nuclear matter incompressibility at saturation @xmath15 is understood fairly well , whereas the behavior of the , more general , density - dependent incompressibility has not been studied much . by defining the general density - dependent incompressibility k(@xmath16 )",
    "@xcite @xmath17 and neglecting inter - nucleon interactions , one finds @xcite @xmath18 this equation exhibits the density dependence of the incompressibility , known to play an important role in the relation between the measurement of gmrs and the equation of state @xcite : in the case of non - interacting nuclear matter the density - dependent incompressibility is proportional to @xmath19 . at saturation density ( @xmath20=0.16 @xmath21 )",
    "( [ eq : rinf ] ) yields @xmath22=220 mev , and at the so - called crossing density @xcite ( @xmath23=0.1 @xmath21 ) one gets @xmath24=160 mev .",
    "this shows that the density dependence of the incompressibility of non - interacting nuclear matter presents a good approximation at saturation density but not at the crossing density , for which @xmath2540 mev is the expected value @xcite .",
    "this can be understood because at the crossing density interaction effects are expected to be more important , whereas at saturation density the homogeneous nucleonic system can simply be modeled by non - interacting hard spheres . considering an average spacing @xmath26 among the constituents , one gets for the homogeneous density of the system : @xmath27 in the case of nucleons , @xmath281.2 fm yields @xmath29 0.15 @xmath21 , and this shows the validity of the model in the vicinity of saturation density .    approximating the nucleus by a free fermi gas of nucleons",
    ", we study a spherical fermionic a - body system with a typical equilibrium inter - nucleon distance @xmath26 .",
    "the radius of the system is then @xmath30=@xmath31 . to establish a link between the incompressibility @xmath32 and the zero - point energy , one inserts eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rinf ] ) , and this leads to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the zero - point kinetic energy ( zpe ) of a fermion in the system @xcite : @xmath35    the zpe , first discussed by mottelson in ref .",
    "@xcite , depends only on the characteristics of the constituent fermions , but not on the system itself . for nucleons",
    "@xmath36 30 mev , and this yields @xmath37 210 mev .",
    "it should be noted that blaizot also derived a relation between k@xmath3 and the average kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "however , the average kinetic energy depends on the model and the system considered . here",
    "the incompressibility is linked to the zpe , which does not depend on any model nor on the specific system .",
    "( [ eq : rinf2 ] ) shows that the larger the zpe , the system becomes more difficult to compress : quantum localization of individual nucleons determines the nuclear incompressibility . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath32 should be independent of a because the incompressibility is directly linked to the nucleonic zpe ( provided , of course , that the surface to volume ratio is small enough ) .      in the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) approximation the @xmath38 radial compression mode ( gmr )",
    "can be represented by a 2@xmath39 mode @xcite , where @xmath39 is @xmath40 assuming spherical density , @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ka ] ) can be approximated by @xmath42/5 where @xmath30 is the nuclear radius , and the gmr energy becomes : @xmath43 in the ho approximation @xmath44=2@xmath39 , and from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ho ] ) and ( [ eq : ka2 ] ) one obtains : @xmath45 therefore , in the ho approximation the compression modulus is also found to be constant and directly related to the zero - point kinetic energy ( zpe ) .",
    "this again means that the higher the zpe , the harder it becomes to compress the system . for nuclei @xmath32",
    "is expected to be a constant in the lowest - order approximation , depending only on the nucleon mass and the typical inter - nucleon distance .",
    "( [ eq : katop ] ) yields @xmath32 @xmath46 140 mev , and one expects that the ho value is more accurate than the one obtained in the fermi gas model .",
    "this is because the ho potential presents a much better first - order approximation to the nuclear mean - field potential .",
    "if independent of a , however , the value @xmath32 @xmath1 140 mev does not correspond to the limit of infinite nuclear matter when @xmath47 , that is , @xmath15=220 mev .",
    "the reason is that the ho value has been derived under the assumption that the gmr is a 2@xmath39 mode , but this is not valid any more for infinite nuclear matter . in that case",
    ", it is the incompressibility of the fermi gas that should be used , yielding @xmath32=210 mev as described above .",
    "this difference is also confirmed by the fact that : i ) @xmath48 mev is predicted by microscopic calculations in finite nuclei @xcite , and ii ) @xmath49 mev is obtained by microscopic extrapolation of gmr measurements to infinite nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the first fully microscopic studies of the behavior of k@xmath3 as a function of the number of nucleons were performed in the 80 s @xcite . at that time",
    "only four spherical magic nuclei were considered : @xmath50o , @xmath51ca , @xmath52zr and @xmath0pb .",
    "it was inferred that @xmath32 is not very sensitive to a , although a general conclusion was hindered by the small number of nuclei included in the analysis .",
    "one should also emphasize that light nuclei are unlikely to fit into the general picture because of the large surface to volume ratio . in light nuclei",
    "the experimental isgmr strength distribution displays pronounced fragmentation , and it is hard to extract a well - defined value for the monopole energy .    to investigate the evolution of nuclear incompressibility along isotopic chains , it is necessary to use global , edf - based models , that also take into account pairing effects .",
    "the constrained - hfb ( chfb ) and the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite are employed in the present study . for the latter , both relativistic and non - relativistic implementations",
    "will be used to reduce possible model dependencies .",
    "our aim is to verify , in a microscopic calculation , the constant behavior of @xmath32 predicted by the analytical model described in the previous section .",
    "microscopic edf - based calculations of isoscalar gmrs are usually performed using the chfb or the qrpa frameworks @xcite . in this study",
    "we calculate the gmr excitation energies using the chfb approach based on a skyrme edf , and qrpa calculations are carried out using both skyrme and relativistic functionals .      the extension of the constrained hf method @xcite to include pairing correlations , that is , the chfb approach has been detailed in ref .",

    "[ fig : ka ] are close to 140 mev , in quantitative agreement with the ho prediction ( eq . ( [ eq : rinf2 ] ) ) .",

    "many energy functionals are characterized by values of the effective mass @xmath82 that are smaller than 1 . in this case",
    "it is the rpa attractive residual interaction that lowers the monopole energy to its empirical value , even when the unperturbed energy is larger than 2@xmath39 , that is , ( 2@xmath83 ) .",
    "therefore , one understands that the ho estimate of k@xmath84140 mev is close to the results obtained edf calculations .",
    "even though the latter include effects of the effective mass and the residual interaction , there is an approximate cancellation of these effects .",
    "the sudden decrease of k@xmath3 beyond the doubly magic nuclei @xmath85sn and @xmath0pb is , of course , related to the opening of new major shells in which monopole particle - hole configurations are formed .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a soft monopole mode that increases the monopole moment @xmath8 and , consequently , decreases the deduced value of k@xmath3 .",
    "soft monopole modes have been predicted in several studies @xcite . in ref .",

    "however , the present results show that just beyond major - shell closure the nuclear incompressibility decreases because of the appearance of the soft monopole mode .",

    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig : snr ] and [ fig : pbr ] clearly exhibit the emergence of a soft monopole mode in the qrpa monopole response functions of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "it might , therefore , be useful to calculate the values of the incompressibility @xmath32 separately in the low - energy region of the soft mode , and in the energy region of the gmr .",

    "[ fig : kasn ] and [ fig : kapb ] , where the isotopic dependence of this values , calculated using the qrpa with the functional sly5 , is plotted for a series of sn and pb nuclei , respectively . the boundary between the low - energy and gmr regions",
    "is set arbitrarily at 13.5 mev for sn isotopes , and at 11 mev for pb isotopes .",
    "@xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is determined from the monopole response below ( above ) this threshold .",
    "the isotopic dependence of @xmath86 and @xmath87 reflects the evolution of the soft monopole mode and the gmr .",
    "while in the case of the sn isotopes no definite trend is found , for the pb nuclei both @xmath86 and @xmath87 show a steady decrease with increasing neutron number .",
    "the incompressibility of finite fermionic systems has been studied using several analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "analytic relations obtained using a simple free fermi gas or harmonic oscillator ( ho ) models point to a direct link between the incompressibility of the system and the zero point kinetic energy of constituent particles .",
    "the incompressibility is thus related to the localization of the individual fermions . for atomic nuclei the ho model predicts the incompressibility @xmath88 5@xmath89 mev .    to quantitatively analyze the evolution of nuclear incompressibility in isotopic chains of medium - heavy and heavy nuclei ,",
    "microscopic edf - based approaches have been used : the constrained hfb method and the qrpa based on both non - relativistic and relativistic density functionals .",
    "all microscopic models predict a remarkably similar trend for the incompressibility : an almost constant behavior in stable nuclei and systems not far from stability , with values of @xmath32 close to those predicted by the ho model , and a steep decrease of @xmath32 in nuclei with pronounced neutron excess , caused by the emergence of a soft monopole mode in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "it would be important to have an experimental confirmation of the soft monopole mode in neutron - rich nuclei and , more generally , to study the behavior of the monopole response in exotic nuclei and/or beyond shell closures .",
    "for instance , measurement of the gmr beyond @xmath85sn and @xmath0pb would be very interesting .",

    "<S> the incompressibility of finite fermionic systems is investigated using analytical approaches and microscopic models . </S>",
    "<S> the incompressibility of a system is directly linked to the zero - point kinetic energy of constituent fermions , and this is a universal feature of fermionic systems . in the case of atomic nuclei , this implies a constant value of the incompressibility in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of nuclear incompressibility along sn and pb isotopic chains is analyzed using global microscopic models , based on both non - relativistic and relativistic energy functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the result is an almost constant incompressibility in stable nuclei and systems not far from stability , and a steep decrease in nuclei with pronounced neutron excess , caused by the emergence of a soft monopole mode in neutron - rich nuclei . </S>"
