    "many - body green s function theory is a powerful tool for theoretical studies of spin systems . in this formalism",
    ", a certain decoupling approximation is generally required to terminate the infinite hierarchy of equations of motion for higher - order green s functions . the first ( lowest ) order decoupling scheme introduced by tyablikov,@xcite which is called the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) or `` tyablikov decoupling , '' is a very simple yet effective way to perform this operation .",
    "many previous authors have attempted to go beyond tyablikov s method and generated a variety of decoupling procedures such as the callen decoupling,@xcite tahir - kheli s theory,@xcite the modified versions of the callen decoupling,@xcite and oguchi s variational theory.@xcite nevertheless , it is known that the rpa decoupling is still the simplest and most reliable first order approximation [ see , for example , the comparison between the rpa , the callen decoupling , and the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations in ref .  ] .",
    "more quantitative results may be obtained by applying the second - order green s function theory originally proposed by kondo and yamaji  @xcite for the one - dimensional isotropic heisenberg model . in this theory ,",
    "the hierarchy of equations of motion is terminated at the second step with introducing vertex parameters .",
    "shimahara and takada  @xcite applied this theory to the two - dimensional case , and junger _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and antsygina _",
    "et al_.  @xcite extended it to the case where a uniform external field is applied .",
    "several other methods  @xcite have also been attempted .",
    "however , some problems , e.g. , how to determine the vertex parameters , are still under discussion , and thus these formalisms have not been fully established yet .",
    "therefore , the simple rpa decoupling scheme is still often used for analytical studies of complicated systems .",
    "field - induced phenomena in spin systems have been the focus of both theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "for example , in uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnets , the magnetic field applied along the easy - axis induces multicritical behavior at the triple point of the antiferromagnetic , spin - flop , and paramagnetic phases.@xcite the spin reorientation transition induced by a transverse magnetic field has also attracted considerable interest for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases.@xcite some of them were studied by using green s function formalism with the rpa decoupling .",
    "however , in this paper , we point out that one should pay careful attention in applying the rpa decoupling scheme to such a complicated system , which has an anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the magnetization . as an example of such systems , we consider spin-@xmath2 ferromagnets with an easy - plane exchange anisotropy .",
    "this system can be described by a comparatively simple model , and thus we can clarify the issues .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ 2 ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian considered in this paper . in sec .",

[ 4 ] , we show that one more equation , which can not be obtained by the above procedure , can be derived by considering all combinations of green s functions .",
    "moreover , we point out that the two equations contradict each other if one demands that the identities of the spin operators are exactly satisfied . in sec .  [ 5 ] , the cause of the problems found in the previous section are discussed , and we attempt to improve the method in a self consistent way .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the qmc data .",
    "finally , a summary is presented in sec .  [ 6 ] .",
