    "this method of calibration assumes perfect pointing only for the template spectrum , pointing errors on all other vx sgr observations will be corrected relative to the template scan . at bima , a phase calibration tone leaking into the bandpass prevented calibration using the spectral template technique .",

    "for the two vlba sites , correspondence between the two calibrations is distinctly inferior . in the elevation range @xmath20 to @xmath21 , the gain curve calibration is consistently below the vx sgr sefd values by as much as a factor of 4 in the case of los alamos , and by a factor of 2.5 for pie town .",
    "the difference between the calibration schemes is probably due to pointing errors at the vlba sites which are given , along with their effects on vlbi amplitudes , in table  [ tab : pointing ] .",
    "the loss factors given are 1@xmath22 values , so the observed scatter in the spectral template results is entirely consistent with pointing errors as well . at 86  ghz ,",
    "the vlba pointing is affected by known systematic pointing offsets at the 20 arc second level due to ripple in the azimuth track ( dhawan , private communication ) .",
    "both a - priori calibration methods thus do not compensate for pointing errors on sgr a * observations at the vlba antennas . in order to avoid these difficulties in calibration , which are likely not tractable at 3.5  mm",

    "a fringe search was conducted on sgr a * to refine the delays and rates using the haystack observatory postprocessing system ( hops ) software .",
    "this step used interpolations of delay and rate from adjacent calibrator scans as well as strong sgr a * detections on sensitive baselines to constrain searches on weaker baselines .",

    "the bispectral snr is proportional to the product of the snrs of each contributing baseline and it can be shown ( rogers , doeleman & moran 1995 ) that this snr is greater than that of the closure phase alone .",
    "we employ a bispectral snr cutoff which ensures an snr in each 10 second segment on each baseline of approximately 1.6 .",

    "<S> at radio wavelengths , images of the compact radio source sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) in the galactic center are scatter broadened with a @xmath0 dependence due to an intervening ionized medium . </S>",
    "<S> we present vlbi observations of sgr a * at 86 ghz using a six station array including the vlba antennas at pie town , fort davis and los alamos , the 12  m antenna at kitt peak and the millimeter arrays at hat creek and owens valley . to avoid systematic errors due to imperfect antenna calibration </S>",
    "<S> , the data were modeled using interferometric closure information . </S>",
    "<S> the data are best modeled by a circular gaussian brightness distribution of fwhm @xmath1 mas . </S>",
    "<S> the data are also shown to be consistent with an elliptical model corresponding to the scattering of a point source . </S>",
    "<S> the source structure in the n - s direction , which is less well determined than in the e - w direction due to the limited n - s @xmath2 coverage of the array , is constrained to be less than 0.27 mas by these measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with extrapolations of intrinsic structure estimates obtained with vlbi at 7  mm wavelength assuming the intrinsic size of sgr a * has a greater dependence than @xmath3 with wavelength . </S>"
