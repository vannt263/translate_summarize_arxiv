    "the u(1 ) gauge theory normally consists of a gauge field and matter fields .",
    "the lagrangian is invariant under the simultaneous gauge transformation of the gauge field and the matter fields .",
    "after this was generalized to non - abelian group@xcite , we learned that the non - abelian extension underlies dynamics of the fundamental particles .",
    "let us take a side step and ask out of curiosity the following question : is it possible to construct a gauge - invariant lagrangian with matter fields alone ?",
    "for instance , can we construct a _",
    "local _ field theory with the electron - positron field alone such that it is invariant under the space - time dependent rotation @xmath4 even in the absence of an auxiliary gauge field ? if the particles are bosons , the @xmath5/@xmath6 model@xcite would probably be the best known example of this type .",
    "its supersymmetric extension was also discussed.@xcite in the case that the matter fields are fermions alone , the history actually goes much further back to the work by bjorken@xcite , but the work along this line has not been fruitful .",
    "the method of the auxiliary vector fields was often used in the past to proceed in this kind of argument .",
    "it introduces nonpropagating gauge fields at start and their kinetic energy terms are added later by the loop contribution , ending up with the lagrangian of matter propagating gauge fields .",
    "many argued that the nonpropagating gauge field implanted as an auxiliary field in lagrangian should be interpreted as turning into a bound state once it has acquired its kinetic energy from the loop contributions .",
    "but it is an inevitable consequence of gauge invariance of lagrangian that such an auxiliary field , elementary or otherwise , ought to acquire a gauge invariant kinetic energy term @xmath7 after loops are included .",
    "would nt it be more illuminating if composition of the massless vector - state can be seen explicitly in terms of the constituent matter fields ?",
    "such a diagrammatic computation was indeed made by haber , hinchliffe and ravinovici@xcite for the @xmath6 model many years ago .",
    "unfortunately , this demonstration can not be repeated when the constituents are fermions , since a simple _ local _ gauge - invariant lagrangian corresponding to that of the @xmath5 model has not been known in the case of fermion constituents .",
    "more recently , attempt has been made to introduce composite gauge bosons through the fifth dimension of the randall - sundrum model @xcite .",
    "the gauge bosons live in the branes and can be interpreted as composite wholly or partially .",
    "this is a new class or concept of composite gauge bosons .",
    "models were built and phenomenology was discussed for possible extensions of the standard model along this line.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to focus on the dynamics of formation of composite gauge bosons at an elementary level of particle physics .",
    "many of us have the underlying conviction or speculation that when lagrangian is locally gauge invariant , gauge bosons must emerge as composite states even if they are not placed as elementary particles",
    ". we would like to see it with our model lagrangians in an explicit diagrammatic way . in order to separate the issue from the argument based on the auxiliary vector field trick",
    ", we study the lagrangians consisting of fermion fields alone . furthermore , since our lagrangian consists only of fermions , supersymmetry is not relevant to our argument , barring the nonlinear realization@xcite .",
    "we stay in the flat space - time of dimension four all the time .",
    "we have no need of an extra dimension explicitly or implicitly .",
    "given our lagrangian , we can carry through diagram calculation in the leading 1/n order with no further approximation or assumption . in this way we can observe how the composite gauge bosons are made of their consituents dynamically .",
    "our reasoning for construction of the lagrangian is simple and resorts to no sophisticated mathematical argument or technique .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to give model lagrangians that advocate inevitability of gauge bosons in gauge symmetric theories .",
    "although application of our class of model lagrangians to the real world is not our primary concern at this moment , short comments are made at the end on issues in electroweak phenomena . at the end , looking back the history of `` compositeness '' including findings in some supersymmetric theories , we wonder if it is really a meaningful concept at a fundamental level .    at present , we do not have in mind an immediate application of our model lagrangian to particle phenomenology .",
    "the gauge bosons have been generally accepted as the `` elementary '' particles and , experimentally , there is no compelling reason of compositeness for them .",
    "therefore we shall not pursue experimental relevance of our models seriously in this paper .",
    "our emphasis at present is primarily on their theoretical implications in composite gauge bosons in general .",
    "when yang and mills introduced the non - abelian gauge field theory@xcite , it had no immediate application .",
    "even the @xmath8-meson was not known at that time although the concept of the weak intermediate bosons was entertained by theorists .",
    "the yang - mills theory became a subject of intense phenomenological interest only after the higgs mechanism@xcite , weinberg s `` a model of leptons''@xcite and quantum chromodynamics were developed unexpectedly one after another .",
    "if we recall this history , we may have chance to see some feature of our models develop into a subject of experimental interest as the large hadron collider upgrades luminosity and energy further .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section ii , following the footstep of the @xmath5 model , we introduce the u(1 ) gauge model of charged dirac fields alone .",
    "we emphasize that , in contrast to the @xmath5 model , one can not write a @xmath9 lagrangian of fermion fields alone with the so - called auxiliary field trick . in section iii we show that the noether current is inevitably absent in the gauge theories that consist of matter fields alone . in section iv , we show dynamics of the u(1 ) gauge - boson formation first in the bosonic matter model and then in the fermionic matter model .",
    "we introduce , as usual , the n families of matter fields and take the large n limit in order to solve the models explicitly in a compact form .",
    "we find that a massless bound state appears in the @xmath1 channel of elastic fermion - antifermion scattering , but that the fermion - antifermion pair must interact in the @xmath10 channel as well in order to form the massless bound state of spin - one . in section",
    "v we extend our models to the non - abelian gauge symmetry . choosing the matter fields in su(2 )",
    "doublet , we can build a non - abelian model with dirac fields .",
    "computing the elastic scattering amplitude , we find the non - abelian gauge bosons in the su(2)-triplet channel as bound states with the correct self - couplings as required by the non - abelian gauge invariance . in our class of models ,",
    "the su(2)-doublet matter plays a special role ; it is impossible to extend the model to matter fields of general su(2 ) multiplets nor to general lie groups .",
    "the special role of the su(2 ) doublet is discussed in the text and also with two examples in one of the appendices . in the final section",
    "vi , we discuss on relevance of the missing noether currents to the no - go theorem of weinberg and witten@xcite .",
    "we conclude with comments on possible relevance to the electroweak phenomenology and on historical mutation of the concept of compositeness .",
    "we proceed by following an elementary line of argument .",
    "the first step is to construct a local lagrangian @xmath11 such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 depends on space - time coordinates @xmath14 only through the unconstrained fields @xmath15 .",
    "we can not construct such a lagrangian backward from the qed lagrangian by integrating out the gauge field @xmath16 : we would need a gauge fixing to integrate over @xmath16 , but fixing a gauge breaks manifest gauge invariance .",
    "we make our search here with the @xmath17 model as a guide .",
    "quantum electrodynamics can not be modified or extended in our way if both renormalizability and locality are required in the space - time of ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "we do not consider here genuinely or intrinsically nonlocal field theories in which the fundamental fields and/or interaction contains nonlocality .",
    "in contrast to nonlocality , unrenormalizability can be controlled formally by dimensional regularization or by a covariant cutoff in phenomenology .",
    "therefore , we abandon here renormalizability in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions for the moment and move to a world off ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions or consider a covariant cutoff theory in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .      in order to construct a local lagrangian with fermion matter fields alone ,",
    "we first reexamine the gauge invariance of the bosonic matter model , namely the @xmath5 model , from a slightly different viewpoint .    in the @xmath5 model the gauge noninvariance of the free lagrangian @xmath18 due to @xmath19 under @xmath20",
    "must be counterbalanced with that of the interaction @xmath21 .",
    "therefore @xmath21 must have at least the same number of derivatives as @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath21 have the same space - time dimension , we must introduce an inverse of @xmath22 in @xmath21 to make up for the dimension due to @xmath23 in the numerator of @xmath21 . keeping the number of @xmath23 in @xmath21 the smallest , we reach almost uniquely the simplest form of the gauge - invariant lagrangian made of the matter fields alone as @xmath24 where @xmath18 is the standard free lagrangian , @xmath25 and the interaction lagrangian @xmath21 is given by @xmath26 the indices @xmath27 run from @xmath28 to @xmath29 so that the model be solvable in the leading order of @xmath30 .",
    "they are referred to as the _ copy _ indices hereafter . from time to time , however , the summation over the copy indices will be suppressed unless we need to remind of it .    under the local u(1 ) gauge transformation ,",
    "the fields transform with a space - time dependent phase @xmath31 common to all the copy index @xmath32 as @xmath33 for the total lagrangian , each of @xmath18 and @xmath21 varies nontrivially under the gauge transformation eq.([bgt ] ) , but the variations @xmath34 and @xmath35 are so made as to be proportional to each other : @xmath36 these gauge variations cancel each other between @xmath18 and @xmath21 for @xmath37 if we remove the mass term and impose the constraint @xmath38 in eq.([lbint ] ) , we recognize this lagrangian ( with @xmath39 ) as that of the @xmath6 model @xcite .",
    "however , we have introduced n copies solely for the purpose of the computational ease of the leading 1/n expansion .",
    "our interest is not in the su(n ) symmetry among the different copies .",
    "as far as u(1 ) gauge invariance is concerned , we may add to eq.([lb ] ) the terms that are gauge invariant by themselves .",
    "for instance , nonderivative @xmath40-couplings such as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are arbitrary real constants . however , in the leading 1/n order the interactions such as @xmath43 do not affect on the bound - state formation .",
    "therefore we leave out such interactions hereafter .",
    "it is reassuring to see later that the vector bound state comes out massless with the correct gauge coupling irrespectively of the additional gauge - invariant interactions such as @xmath44 .      following the reasoning outlined above , we can obtain with a little stretch of imagination a fermionic extension of the bosonic model lagrangian eq.([lb ] ) . since the free lagrangian @xmath18 contains only one first - derivative of @xmath45 , the interaction @xmath21 can counterbalance the gauge variation of @xmath18 with only one first - derivative of field .",
    "just as in the bosonic case , we need to introduce the inverse of the scalar density @xmath46 in @xmath21 in order to match the dimension . following this reasoning as in the bosonic model ,",
    "we reach the lagrangian @xmath47 , @xmath48 where the gauge invariance is realized at @xmath39 . under the gauge transformation , @xmath49 the lagrangian of eq.([lf ] )",
    "is invariant by cancellation between the gauge variations of @xmath18 and @xmath21 at @xmath39 : @xmath50 we may add to @xmath21 the self - gauge - invariant terms such as @xmath51 where insertion of the fermion mass @xmath52 is just to make the constant @xmath53 dimensionless .",
    "the constant @xmath53 is unconstrained by gauge invariance .",
    "after we compute for the massless bound state with @xmath21 of eq.([lf ] ) alone , we shall examine how the interactions like @xmath43 affect its mass and coupling . since they will turn out to be irrelevant to determination of the mass and coupling of the massless bound state",
    ", we shall not include them in our diagram calculation . before diagram calculation",
    ", some may suspect that the fermion - antifermion interaction through @xmath54 might be responsible for or relevant to binding a gauge boson .",
    "it is wrong .",
    "such an interaction does not exist in our @xmath21 . even if one includes it in @xmath21 , it does not participate in formation of the massless gauge boson nor in determination of the gauge coupling , as we shall see later .    our fermionic lagrangian eq.([lf ] ) is obviously nonrenormalizable in four space - time dimensions just like that of the @xmath17 model . as we know",
    ", the only renormalizable u(1 ) gauge field theory with a charged fermion is quantum electrodynamics : it needs the propagating gauge field @xmath55 explicitly in lagrangian .",
    "our bosonic lagrangian eq.([lb ] ) with @xmath56 takes the same form as what we could obtain by starting with the gauge - invariant lagrangian of a nonpropagating auxiliary gauge field @xmath55 , @xmath57 either by integrating eq.([auxb ] ) over @xmath58 or by substituting the equation of motion for @xmath58 , @xmath59 we obtain for @xmath60 the @xmath5 lagrangian ( before imposing the constraint and turning it into @xmath6)@xcite .",
    "when we compute by the loop correction the dimension - four operator of @xmath58 for the effective action , we obtain the `` kinetic energy term '' @xmath61 .",
    "one can not obtain anything other than the gauge invariant @xmath62 term ( `` the maxwell term '' ) since the lagrangian eq.([auxb ] ) is gauge invariant by construction . whether this appearance of the @xmath62 term is to be interpreted as `` generation of a bound state '' or not should be subject to debate .",
    "if we accepted such interpretation , a massless spin - one state would emerge irrespectively of strength of the interaction @xmath63 which is implanted in eq.([auxb ] ) at the beginning .",
    "after a rescaling of the @xmath55 field , the physical coupling of @xmath55 to @xmath64 is fixed to some number , which is independent of @xmath65 in the one - loop and logarithmically divergent in four dimensions .",
    "turning of the field @xmath55 into a massless boson is guaranteed once the field is introduced as an auxiliary field . in contrast , in our model the strength of interaction @xmath21 must be tuned to the optimum value ( @xmath39 ) in order to make the bound state massless . in this way",
    "we see that masslessness of the vector bound - state is a dynamical consequence of gauge invariance rather than a kinematical outcome .",
    "substitution of the equation of motion eq.([eofm ] ) also needs scrutiny : if one computes @xmath66 with this @xmath58 , one would obtain @xmath67 instead of @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the field @xmath58 of eq.([eofm ] ) is not acceptable as the composite gauge field .",
    "one would need contributions from loops to write a dynamical gauge field that obeys the correct equation of motion .",
    "we do not know how to write such an object in a local composite field .    what would happen if one attempts to introduce the auxiliary field @xmath55 in the fermionic model ?",
    "for the fermionic matter , the lagrangian with a nonpropagating auxiliary field is simply equal to @xmath69 the equation of motion with respect to @xmath55 is trivially equal to @xmath70 and provides us nothing . as for the functional integration over the auxiliary field @xmath55 , one can not carry it out at the tree level since the auxiliary lagrangian eq.([auxf ] ) is not quadratic in @xmath55 unlike that of the bosonic model .",
    "when the two - point loop - diagrams of @xmath71 is computed , the local limit of the two - point functions ought to be proportional to @xmath72 by the underlying gauge invariance .",
    "but we can not obtain a compact local lagrangian of the matter fields alone such as ours out of the auxiliary lagrangian of eq.([auxf ] ) .",
    "the auxiliary vector - field trick bypasses the important part of dynamics of the matter fields . in contrast , our explicit lagrangian models provide dynamical details of binding which are missing in the auxiliary field trick or else very different from it .",
    "when we attempt to write a conserved current in our models , we encounter one peculiar problem : we are unable to construct a conserved current with the prescription of the noether theorem .",
    "in fact , such a current simply does not exist .    according to the general prescription",
    ", the noether current @xmath73 is obtained when lagrangian is invariant under a set of space - time independent phase transformations of fields . in the bosonic model",
    ", it would be generated by the transformation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is infinitesimal and _ independent _ of space - time .",
    "the variation @xmath76 of @xmath77 under this transformation leads to divergence of the noether current through the identification ,",
    "@xmath78 using the equation of motion in the right - hand side , one ought to obtain the noether current @xmath73 as @xmath79 when we follow this standard procedure in our models , we find that the right - hand side of eq.([noethereq ] ) is identically zero in the gauge symmetry limit by cancellation between the contributions from @xmath18 and @xmath21 : @xmath80 where the term proportional to @xmath81 comes from @xmath21 and the gauge symmetry holds at @xmath39 .",
    "one may be puzzled when one thinks of perturbative calculation : since @xmath82 and @xmath83 always appear pairwise in product in the lagrangian , one may assign the conserved u(1 ) charge @xmath84 to @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "then this charge ought to be conserved in all diagrams of physical processes such as scattering and decay even in the gauge symmetry limit where the noether current disappears .",
    "the same happens in the fermionic model too .",
    "just as in the bosonic model , the conserved noether current disappears in the gauge symmetry limit : @xmath85 the current @xmath86 is not the noether current .",
    "it is a general property of the gauge theories having no gauge field that the noether current is identically zero ; @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to trace the root cause of absence of the noether current to local gauge invariance itself .",
    "an almost trivial proof is given in the appendix a. the proof can be easily extended to the non - abelian models .",
    "it has an important implication in the non - abelian case : if the noether current existed , generation of the massless gauge bosons would face a potential conflict with the no - go theorem of weinberg and witten@xcite .    unlike the noether current , the conserved energy - momentum tensor exists in the abelian and non - abelian gauge theories of matter fields alone . for the fermionic u(1 ) model with the lagrangian of eq.([lf ] ) , the conserved energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath88 it is manifestly gauge invariant with the matter fields alone .",
    "it is natural to wonder if our u(1 ) models contain a gauge boson as a composite state even though we have not placed it by hand . in order to answer to this question ,",
    "we carry out diagram calculation in this section in order to exhibit the dynamical mechanism of forming the composite gauge boson .",
    "we compute our models perturbatively in the 1/n expansion : we sum an infinite series of the leading 1/n order terms and show explicitly that a massless vector boson indeed appears as a pole in scattering amplitudes with the properties required by gauge symmetry both in the bosonic and the fermionic model . in the case of the @xmath6 model",
    "in which @xmath89 is subject to a constraint , this diagram computation was done by haber _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "our primary interest is in the fermionic model , which is technically complex since channel coupling occurs between the @xmath1 and @xmath10 channels . unlike the formal argument based on the auxiliary vector - field trick@xcite , the diagrammatic computation allows us to see",
    "explicitly how a massless bound state is formed dynamically with the matter particles .",
    "for instance , when we examine elastic fermion - antifermion scattering of @xmath90 , we find that the massless bound state appears in the @xmath1 channel , not in the @xmath10 channel .",
    "that is , the bound state couples with the fermions through the vertex @xmath2 , not through @xmath91 .",
    "nonetheless , the interactions of both types are needed to form a massless bound state .",
    "we start with our u(1 ) bosonic model for study of a composite gauge boson before our study of the fermionic model since the computation is simpler for the bosonic model , yet it demonstrates essential aspects of the diagram calculation .",
    "we consider the two - body @xmath92 scattering in @xmath93-wave ( @xmath90 ) , treating all @xmath29 copies of the fields ( @xmath94 ) as independent .",
    "we show that a pole of a massless bound - state appears in this channel",
    ". then we proceed to make sure that the pattern and magnitude of the coupling of this bound state indeed obey what we expect for the u(1 ) gauge boson .",
    "we study the @xmath93-wave amplitude for the two - body scattering , @xmath95 we compute the amplitude in the leading @xmath30 order since a compact explicit solution can be obtained only in this order . in the scattering eq.([bscat ] ) , the copy indices are chosen to be the same for the initial particles and also for the final particles . in the diagram calculation , @xmath21 is separated from @xmath96 in eq.([lbint ] ) and treated as _ the interaction_.",
    "while this statement sounds trivial , we point out one subtlety .",
    "that is , when we carry out perturbative calculation by splitting the lagrangian into @xmath18 and @xmath21 , we have fixed once for all the gauge ambiguity of our lagrangian eq.([lb ] ) .",
    "that is , when we write the propagator of @xmath64 in the momentum space as @xmath97 , we need no more gauge fixing since there is no @xmath58 field in the lagrangian . with this separation ,",
    "the fields obey the equation of motion of @xmath18 that violates gauge symmetry .",
    "consequently the noether current of @xmath18 is the conserved current in diagrams . for the purpose of visualizing how the gauge - invariance limit is reached , we float @xmath81 in @xmath21 as a free parameter until we set it to unity at the end of calculation .    in the diagram calculation of the leading 1/n order , we normal",
    "- order the operator @xmath89 in the denominator of @xmath21 and expand it around its vacuum value as @xmath98 where the summation @xmath99 with no index attached means the summation over the copy index @xmath100 .",
    "this separation of the vacuum value is important to handle the denominator of @xmath21 in a systematic 1/n expansion.@xcite the vacuum expectation value @xmath101 is infinite in the ( 3 + 1 ) space - time , so it is regularized dimensionally as @xmath102 where @xmath29 copies of bosons contribute to the vacuum value of the scalar density .",
    "the space - time dimension @xmath103 is set to four eventually .",
    "we denote this vacuum - expectation - value by @xmath104 hereafter , @xmath105 now we are ready to compute for the two - body scattering of eq.([bscat ] ) .",
    "the great simplification of the leading @xmath30 order is that for elastic scattering we have only to sum the chain of the bubble diagrams , as shown in fig . 1 , in which the copy index @xmath32 runs within a loop of each bubble .",
    "let us define with the s - matrix the two - body scattering amplitude @xmath106 as @xmath107 the amplitude @xmath108 has the lorentz structure of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 and the one - particle states are normalized as @xmath111 so that the amplitude @xmath112 is a lorentz scalar . for the elastic scattering in the leading @xmath30 order , it is sufficient to keep only the first term of the expansion eq.([expansion ] ) in the denominator of @xmath21 .",
    "the normal - ordered product @xmath113 starts contributing to the next - to - leading order of 1/n in the elastic scattering .",
    "the amplitude @xmath114 starts with a contact interaction term with no bubble , the first term in the right - hand side of fig .",
    "1 , which is equal to @xmath115 where the superscript `` zero '' of @xmath116 indicates the zero - loop contribution of @xmath117 .",
    "the bubble summation can be carried out by solving the algebraic equation ( fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath118 where the kernel @xmath119 is given by the single bubble diagram in which the copy index flows around the loop . eq.([baleq ] ) will become powerful later when we sum the corresponding series in the fermionic model in which two eigenchannels contribute and entangle in formation of a bound state .",
    "straightforward computation gives us the kernel as @xmath120 since we want to extract the pole and residue of a massless bound state at @xmath121 , we need @xmath122 only to the orders no higher than @xmath123 .",
    "the factor outside the large bracket in eq.([kernel ] ) is simply equal to @xmath81 when eq.([vacb ] ) is substituted for @xmath124 so that @xmath125 note here that @xmath122 does not satisfy the transversality , @xmath126 .",
    "this is not violation of gauge invariance . in the standard lagrangian where the elementary @xmath55 field is present",
    ", one would need the @xmath127 term to realize transversality of the photon self - energy , @xmath128 , namely , gauge invariance .",
    "the term needed for transversality does exist in our model , but it is tucked away elsewhere at this stage . as we shall see in a moment , it is this nontransversality of @xmath122 that makes the composite boson massless .",
    "model analyzed in @xcite too . ] .",
    "let us substitute eq.([kernel1 ] ) in the iteration equation eq.([baleq ] ) and move the term @xmath129 of the kernel @xmath122 to the left - hand side . we may drop the term proportional to @xmath130 by use of @xmath131 on the external boson lines .",
    "then eq.([baleq ] ) turns into @xmath132 now we go to the gauge limit @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath134 is independent of @xmath135 , eq.([aleq1 ] ) tells us that in this limit there is a pole at @xmath136 in the amplitude @xmath114 as @xmath137 when the parameter @xmath81 is off the gauge limit ( @xmath138 ) , the pole is located away from zero at @xmath139m^2 $ ] so that the bound state would be either a massive vector boson or a tachyon .",
    "we extract the residue of the pole at @xmath121 for @xmath39 and compare this residue with what we would obtain from the feynman diagram of the standard u(1 ) gauge lagrangian of the charged scalar fields , @xmath140 by equating our residue with that of feynman diagram , we obtain the coupling @xmath63 of our model as @xmath141 when we approach the space - time dimension of @xmath142 , this coupling can be expressed in terms of the logarithmic cutoff of divergence as @xmath143 where @xmath144 ( @xmath145 = euler constant ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath63 comes out to be correctly positive .",
    "it is amusing to observe that the factor @xmath146 in the denominator of eq.([pole ] ) is combined with @xmath147 in @xmath148 of @xmath134 to turn into @xmath149 , which is the logarithmic divergence in the space - time dimension of @xmath142 .",
    "that is , a quadratic divergence @xmath147 metamorphoses into a logarithmic divergence , which can happen in the dimensional regularization .",
    "if we started with the auxiliary @xmath55 field and generate the @xmath150 to the leading 1/n order , we would obtain the coupling constant identical with eq.([u1bcoupling1 ] ) after rescaling @xmath55 by wave - function renormalization.@xcite this equality is not unexpected since the one - loop self - energy diagram of the auxiliary @xmath55 field leading to eq.([u1bcoupling1 ] ) is identical with the bubble diagram of the @xmath93-wave @xmath151 scattering in the leading 1/n order .",
    "there is no guarantee that this equality holds beyond the leading 1/n order since noncontact interactions enter the scattering amplitude while the self - energy diagram remains the two - point function .    in order to claim that the massless bound state discovered above is indeed the u(1 ) gauge boson",
    ", we must show that other couplings of this state obey the pattern required for the gauge boson .",
    "one may bypass this part by resorting to the gauge invariance that has been embedded in the lagrangian of our model .",
    "but we show here explicitly how the u(1)-gauge invariance arises diagrammatically for the coupling of the massless bound state .",
    "absence of the coupling @xmath152 is obvious since the form of our @xmath21 requires the bound state to couple with @xmath153 through @xmath154 not through @xmath155 .",
    "this is also required by @xmath156-invariance of our lagrangian .",

    "what should we do with this theorem for our non - abelian models ?",
    "if we could write the non - abelian noether currents with the matter fields alone , we would potentially interfere with this theorem .",
    "however , the lorentz - covariant conserved currents do not exist in our models .",

    "to be frank , the present author is not totally comfortable with this answer .",
    "but it appears in our models that generation of the massless non - abelian composite bosons evades the conflict with the weinberg - witten theorem .",

    "both experimentalists and phenomenologists are working toward to this goal @xcite .",
    "when our model is expressed as a composite gauge theory with the effective fields @xmath371 , difference from the minimal standard model would appear in the interactions of dimension higher than four which are suppressed by powers of @xmath399 at @xmath400 .",

    "is it really possible to tell experimentally or even theoretically whether a given particle is elementary or composite ?",
    "this is a nagging question that confronted theorists@xcite at the height of nuclear democracy in the early 1960 s .",
    "theorists proposed various criteria of compositeness , but no consensus emerged .",

    "can we really answer the question of elementarity vs compositeness once for all ?",
    "the following theorem was given by kamefuchi , orafeartaigh and salam@xcite in 1961 : if a composite local operator carries all quantum numbers of a given particle in regard to space - time ( @xmath401 ) and other properties ( charge , isospin etc ) , it gives the same s matrix amplitudes on the particle mass shell up to overall normalizations .",
    "difference shows up only off the mass shell .",
    "but the `` off - shell amplitudes '' are not really scattering amplitudes of the particle , but include continuum contributions . according to this theorem , therefore , the definition of particle fields is infinitely ambiguous with respect to their continua .",

    ", we were tempted to replace the field theory with the s - matrix theory in the 1960 s so as to deal only with the on - shell amplitudes and the observables . as we know , it led us to the dual resonance model and then back to lagrangian theory of strings with the nambu - goto action",
    ".    meanwhile , the present author has been brought attention to one interesting observation in supersymmetric theory . along the line of the olive - montonen conjecture , seiberg and",
    "witten@xcite showed in the @xmath402 supersymmetric theory that the strong and weak coupling limits are dual to each other . to be more specific , the roles of a particle and a soliton of the same spin - parity are interchanged between the strong and weak limits of coupling .",
    "since solitons are composite in everyone s picture , in such theories elementarity vs compositeness loses its absolute meaning .",

    "if something similar holds in nonsupersymmetric theory as well , the meaning of elementarity and compositeness of particles would finally disappear and the naming would become just for a matter of convenience ; if lagrangian takes the simplest form with a certain choice for a set of particle fields , one would call such particles as _ elementary _ for convenience .",
    "the noether current does not exist in the theories that satisfy local gauge invariance with matter fields alone .",
    "the proof is almost trivial .",
    "we give it here only for the u(1 ) bosonic model since extension to fermions and non - abelian theories is straightforward .    under the u(1 ) gauge transformation",

    "this cancellation is nothing other than gauge invariance itself .",
    "consequently , eq.([acurrent ] ) does not follow in the conventional gauge theory .",
    "extension of this proof to the fermion models and the non - abelian models is just as simple and easy .    despite this general proof of @xmath412",

    "then the result is a trivial identity : @xmath422 .",
    "therefore the conclusion from this exercise is as follows : only when one violates gauge invariance by staying away from the symmetry limit ( @xmath138 ) , can the noether theorem define a conserved current in the familiar form with strength reduced by @xmath413 .",
    "the same happens for our fermion model . just as in the bosonic model ,",
    "the current @xmath423 is not the conserved noether current in the gauge symmetry limit .",
