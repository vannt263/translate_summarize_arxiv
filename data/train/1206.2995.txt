    "the last decades have witnessed the great progress experienced by the interdisciplinary field of quantum information science @xcite , which began with the recognition of the potential of quantum systems and quantum correlations for information processing tasks . while it is well known that quantum entanglement is essential for quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and also for achieving exponential speed - up in pure state based quantum algorithms @xcite , the mixed state based quantum algorithm of knill and laflamme @xcite showed that such speedup could in principle be achieved in this case without a substantial presence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "this has oriented the attention to alternative definitions and measures of quantum correlations for mixed states , like the quantum discord @xcite .",
    "while coinciding with the entanglement entropy for pure states , the quantum discord differs essentially from the entanglement of formation in the case of mixed states , being non - zero in most separable mixed states and vanishing just for states which are strictly classically correlated at least with respect to one of the constituents , i.e. , diagonal in a standard or conditional product basis @xcite .",

    "@xcite showing the existence of a finite discord between the control qubit and the remaining qubits in the circuit of ref .",
    "@xcite , unleashed a great interest on this measure and several investigations on its fundamental properties @xcite , on its evaluation on spin chains and specific states @xcite as well as on related measures @xcite , have been recently made ( see ref .",

    "distinct quantum capabilities of states with non - zero discord have also been recently investigated @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to describe the remarkable behavior of the quantum discord and of other related entropic measures of quantum correlations , in the exact ground state of finite @xmath0 chains in a transverse field @xcite .",
    "we first provide in sections 25 a brief review of the quantum discord and of the generalized entropic measures of quantum correlations discussed in refs .",
    "the latter comprise as particular cases the one - way information deficit @xcite and the geometric measure of discord of ref .",
    "@xcite , embedding them in a unified formalism based on majorization @xcite and general entropic forms @xcite .",
    "while their basic features are similar to those of the quantum discord , the possibility of using simple entropic forms permits an easier evaluation , allowing for analytical expressions in some cases , as occurs with the geometric discord of general two qubit states @xcite .",
    "we then use these measures to investigate , in sections 68 , the quantum correlations of spin pairs in the exact ground state of finite @xmath0 chains in a transverse field .",
    "we review the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite on the behavior of the quantum discord in these chains and also add new results concerning the behavior of the geometric discord and other related measures in such chains .",
    "the exact ground state of a finite @xmath0 chain in a transverse field has a definite spin parity and this fact will be seen to deeply affect the discord and the previous measures for fields lower than the critical field @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that the essential results in this sector can be interpreted in terms of the discord of mixtures of aligned pairs .    moreover",
    ", these chains can exhibit a _ factorizing field _",
    "@xcite , where they have a completely separable ground state . for transverse fields ,",
    "such eigenstate actually breaks the previous parity symmetry and is hence degenerate , coinciding @xmath2 in a finite chain with the last crossing of the two lowest opposite parity levels @xcite .",
    "a related remarkable effect is that in the immediate vicinity of @xmath2 , pairwise entanglement , though weak , reaches _ full range _",
    "@xcite , regardless of the coupling range . here",
    "we will show that the quantum discord as well as the entropic measures of quantum correlations also reach full range at this point , exhibiting universal features such as being independent of separation and coupling range @xcite .",
    "moreover , the value reached by them at this point is non - negligible and does not decrease with size , in contrast with the pairwise entanglement , since these measures are not restricted by the monogamy property @xcite which affects the latter ( limiting the concurrence @xcite to order @xmath3 in an @xmath4 spin chain if all pairs are equally entangled ) .",
    "consequently , the behavior of these measures with the applied field and separation will deviate significantly from that of the concurrence or entanglement of formation for @xmath5 .",
    "conclusions are finally discussed in section 9 .",

    "they determine , for instance , the values of @xmath287 and @xmath288 in terms of @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath275 and @xmath291 .",
    "a careful engineering of couplings and fields can then always produce a chain with such eigenstate , for any chosen values of @xmath291 .",
    "it is also apparent that this eigenstate is degenerate , since @xmath292|0_j\\rangle$ ] will have the same energy ( and differ from @xmath293 if @xmath294 for some @xmath12 ) , indicating that these fields necessarily correspond to the crossing of two opposite parity levels .",
    "each local state in the product ( [ stt ] ) is a local coherent state .",
    "we also note that any state @xmath295 can be written , except for a normalization factor , in the form ( [ stt ] ) by allowing a complex @xmath296 @xcite .",
    "( [ aa])([bb ] ) are then generally valid for such type of states .",
    "the second equation ( [ bb ] ) cancels the matrix elements of @xmath297 between @xmath293 and one spin excitations , and is then a `` mean field - like '' equation , i.e. , that which arises when minimizing the average energy @xmath298 with respect to the @xmath291 , for fixed fields and couplings . the first equation ( [ aa ] )",
    "ensures that the minimizing separable state is an exact eigenstate , by cancelling the residual matrix elements of @xmath297 connecting @xmath293 with the remaining states ( two - spin excitations ) .",
    "it can be also shown @xcite that in the ferromagnetic - type case @xmath299 where all off - diagonal elements of @xmath297 in the standard basis of @xmath300 eigenstates are real and negative , the state ( [ stt ] ) is necessarily a _ ground state _ if @xmath301 @xmath152 @xmath12 , as the exact ground state must have ( or can be chosen to have if degenerate ) expansion coefficients of the same sign in this basis ( different signs will not decrease @xmath302 ) , and hence can not be orthogonal to @xmath293 @xcite .",
    "in particular , a uniform solution @xmath303 @xmath152 @xmath12 , leading to @xmath304 , is feasible if the coupling anisotropy @xmath305 is _ constant _ @xmath152 @xmath306 and non - negative @xcite . of course , if @xmath307 we can change it to @xmath308 by swapping @xmath309 through a rotation of @xmath310 round the @xmath252 axis .",
    "in such a case , eqs.([aa])([bb ] ) lead to @xmath311 where eq .",

    "( [ aaa])-([bbb ] ) allow , for instance , the existence of a factorizing field for uniform first neighbor couplings @xmath313 in a finite linear spin @xmath314 chain if @xmath315 , both in the cyclic case ( @xmath316 ) , where the factorizing field is completely _ uniform _ , @xmath317 as well as in the open case ( @xmath318 ) , where @xmath319 at inner sites but @xmath320 at the borders @xcite . a fully and equally connected spin @xmath314 array with @xmath321 @xmath152 @xmath322 ( lipkin model @xcite ) will also exhibit a uniform transverse factorizing field at @xmath323 if @xmath324 @xcite .",
    "the ensuing state @xmath293 can be ensured to be a _ ground state _ in all these cases if @xmath325 ( when @xmath326 $ ] ) .",
    "other possibilities , like solutions with alternating angles @xcite , can also be considered .",
    "let us now focus on finite spin chains which exhibit a separable parity breaking exact eigenstate @xmath293 at the factorizing field @xmath2 .",
    "it will be of course degenerate with @xmath327 .",
    "the important point is that the definite parity states @xmath328 i.e. the states ( [ sts ] ) in the uniform case , will also be exact ground states at @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , since the exact ground state of a finite chain will actually be non - degenerate away from the factorizing field ( and the other crossing points ) , it will have a definite parity .",
    "hence , the actual ground state side - limits at @xmath323 will be given by the definite parity states ( [ pt ] ) ( rather than @xmath329 ) .",
    "a ground state parity transition @xmath330 @xmath331 @xmath332 will then take place as the field increases across @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "while the ground states of each parity sector become degenerate in the large @xmath4 limit for fields @xmath5 , in finite chains the degeneracy is lifted and the actual ground state will exhibit important correlations arising just from the definite parity effect .",
    "for instance , in the immediate vicinity of @xmath2 , the pairwise correlations , rather than vanish , will approach the values determined by the states ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "they will then depend on @xmath291 and @xmath296 for a pair @xmath306 , irrespective of the separation @xmath333 . in the uniform case , such correlations",
    "will then be _ independent of the separation _",
    ", since the states ( [ pt ] ) will be completely symmetric and will lead to a separation independent pair reduced state @xmath334 ( @xmath335 denotes the rest of the chain ) .",
    "such state is given exactly by @xcite @xmath336 where @xmath337 for @xmath338 .",
    "this parameter is then small for not too small @xmath4 and @xmath245 . in the @xmath339 limit one",
    "recovers the mixture ( [ st ] ) .    the concurrence of the state ( [ ste ] ) ( a measure of its entanglement @xcite ) depends essentially on @xmath340 and is therefore small , vanishing for @xmath339 ( as in this limit the state ( [ ste ] ) becomes separable ) .",
    "it is given explicitly by @xcite @xmath341 which is parallel ( antiparallel ) @xcite for @xmath342 ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "its maximum value is @xmath344 ( in agreement with the monogamy property @xcite ) , reached for @xmath272 in the negative parity case , where the state ( [ sts ] ) approaches an @xmath345-state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we have seen that the quantum and geometric discord , as well as the other measures of quantum correlations ( [ if ] ) , do acquire finite and non - negligible values in the mixture ( [ st ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , i.e. , in the state ( [ ste ] ) even for @xmath339 , entailing _ simultaneous and coincident _ finite values for all pairs in the state ( [ sts ] ) @xcite .",
    "this implies in turn _ infinite range _ of pairwise quantum correlations , as measured by @xmath259 or @xmath190 , at least in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing field @xmath2 , where they will be described by the state ( [ st ] ) and will therefore be _ independent of both separation and coupling range_.    as illustration , we first depict in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the quantum discord and the geometric discord of spin @xmath234 pairs for @xmath0 couplings ( @xmath346 @xmath152 @xmath306 ) in the ground state of the fully connected array ( lipkin - type model ) and of the nearest - neighbor cyclic chain , for anisotropy @xmath347 in the ferromagnetic type case ( @xmath348 ) .",
    "the emergence of a finite appreciable value of these quantities for @xmath282 , persisting for pairs with large separation even in the case of first neighbor couplings , is then a direct consequence of the definite parity effect .",
    "the exact results for @xmath349 spins were computed by direct diagonalization of @xmath297 in the lipkin case ( where the ground state belongs to the completely symmetric representation having total spin @xmath350 ) , while in the nearest neighbor chain they were obtained through the exact jordan - wigner fermionization @xcite , taking into account the parity effect exactly in the discrete fourier transform ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in both cases",
    "the ground state exhibits @xmath351 parity transitions as the field increases from @xmath281 , the last one at @xmath2 , although for the case depicted ( @xmath352 ) , their effects on @xmath259 or @xmath269 are not visible in the scale of the figure ( they become visible for smaller @xmath4 @xcite ) .",
    "it is verified that at the factorizing field ( [ bs ] ) , the exact results for @xmath259 and @xmath269 in both models coincide with those obtained for the mixture ( [ st ] ) , i.e. , with eqs .",
    "( [ dth ] ) and ( [ i2th ] ) for @xmath353 ( eq .  ( [ aaa ] ) ) , being then identical and the same for any pair at this point .",
    "moreover , in the fully connected case the exact results for @xmath259 and @xmath269 are actually practically coincident with those obtained from the mixture ( [ st ] ) ( dotted lines ) _ in the whole region @xmath354 _ if @xmath245 is the mean field angle satisfying @xmath355 ( eq .  ( [ bb ] ) ) , since the ground state is in this region well approximated by the definite parity states ( [ pt ] ) or ( [ sts ] ) , even away from @xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath259 and @xmath269 for @xmath356 $ ] resembles then that obtained for the mixture ( [ st ] ) for @xmath357 $ ] .",
    "this is not the case in the chain with first neighbor couplings , where the agreement holds just at @xmath2 , and where @xmath259 and @xmath269 become appreciable only for @xmath358 ( which is smaller than the mean field critical field @xmath359 but slightly above the factorizing field @xmath360 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the values attained by @xmath259 and @xmath269 in the whole region @xmath5 are still quite large , owing to the definite parity effect , although they exhibit the effects of correlations beyond the parity projected mean field description provided by the states ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "we also depict in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] results for @xmath259 and @xmath269 for all separations @xmath361 of the spins of the pair , in the nearest neighbor coupling case ( in the fully connected model they are obviously identical @xmath152 @xmath362 ) .",
    "it is seen that the values of @xmath259 and @xmath269 ( and the same for @xmath270 or other @xmath190 s ) rapidly saturate as @xmath362 increases in the region @xmath282 , reaching here a finite non - negligible value due to the definite parity effect , whereas for @xmath363 they are appreciable just for the first few neighbors ( @xmath364 ) . in the last region",
    "they can be described perturbatively @xcite .",
    "it is apparent from figs .",
    "[ f2][f3 ] that the same qualitative information can be obtained either from the quantum discord @xmath259 or the geometric discord @xmath269 , except for the type of maximum .",
    "that of @xmath269 is cusp - like due to the sharp @xmath365 transition in the minimizing measurement direction that arises as the field increases , which parallels that occurring for the state ( [ st ] ) as @xmath245 decreases ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . such transition reflects the change in the type of pairwise correlation , and resembles that of the concurrence ( which changes from antiparallel to parallel at @xmath2 @xcite ) .",
    "we also mention that while the behavior of @xmath270 ( not shown ) is similar to @xmath269 , other @xmath190 can exhibit a smoothed maximum as the transition from @xmath157 to @xmath366 in the measurement direction can be continuous @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that the exact ground state pairwise concurrence in the fully connected case is small ( of order @xmath3 and bounded above by @xmath344 ) , @xcite such that the entanglement monotones associated with @xmath259 and @xmath269 ( the entanglement of formation and the squared concurrence ) are very small in the scale of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . the same occurs with the concurrence of largely separated pairs in the nearest neighbor case @xcite , which is non - zero ( but very small for this anisotropy and size ) just in the immediate vicinity of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we have examined the behavior of pairwise quantum correlations in the exact ground state of finite ferromagnetic - type @xmath0 spin chains in a transverse field , by analyzing the quantum discord as well as other generalized measures of quantum correlations .",
    "we have first provided a brief review of the latter , which are based on general entropic forms and defined as the minimum information loss due to a local measurement in one of the constituents .",
    "they generalize the one - way information deficit and contain the geometric discord as a particular case , preserving at the same time the basic properties of the quantum discord like reducing to the ( generalized ) entanglement entropy in the case of pure states and vanishing just for classically correlated states .",
    "we have shown that all these measures indicate the presence of long range pairwise quantum correlations for @xmath282 in the exact ground state of these chains , which arise essentially from the definite @xmath240 parity of such state and can be understood in terms of the model based on the mixture of aligned states ( [ st ] ) .",
    "they all reach full range at the factorizing field , where they acquire a finite non - negligible constant value which is independent of the pair separation or coupling range and is determined solely by the coupling anisotropy .",
    "such value is exactly described by the states ( [ st ] ) or ( [ ste ] ) , which also provide a quite reliable description of these correlations for all @xmath282 for long range couplings , as we have seen in the case of the fully connected model .",
    "parity effects are then seen to be of paramount importance for a proper description of quantum correlations in finite quantum systems .",
    "a final comment is that the use of simple entropic forms involving just low powers of the density matrix , like those underlying the geometric discord @xmath269 and the cubic measure @xmath270 , enables an easier evaluation , offering at the same time an increased sensitivity of the optimizing measurement to changes in the type of correlation .",

    "<S> we examine the quantum correlations of spin pairs in the ground state of finite @xmath0 chains in a transverse field , by evaluating the quantum discord as well as other related entropic measures of quantum correlations . a brief review of the latter , based on generalized entropic forms , is also included . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that parity effects are of crucial importance for describing the behavior of these measures below the critical field . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that these measures reach full range in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing field , where they become independent of separation and coupling range . </S>",
    "<S> analytical and numerical results for the quantum discord , the geometric discord and other measures in spin chains with nearest neighbor coupling and in fully connected spin arrays are also provided . </S>"
