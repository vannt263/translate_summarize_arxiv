    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the indirect nature of the energy band - gap in silicon has always been the major obstacle for its employment in light emitting devices , since the momentum conservation requires additional mechanisms involved in the recombination process ( e.g. electron - phonon interaction ) , that occur with low probability , hence producing very poor emitting rates . in the last decade the discovery of efficient visible photoluminescence ( pl ) and optical gain from silicon nanoclusters ( si - ncs ) has demonstrated the possibility to overcome the indirect band gap of silicon by exploiting the quantistic behaviour of the matter at the nanoscale.@xcite + theoretically , the optical emission has been attributed to transitions between states localized inside the nanocrystal [ as a consequence of the so - called quantum confinement ( qc ) effect],@xcite or between defect states.@xcite while there is still some debate on which of the above mechanisms primarily determines the emission energy , some recent works have proposed that a concomitance of both mechanisms is always present , favouring one or the other depending on the structural conditions.@xcite in the attempt of explaining the observations , it was suggested that for nc diameters above a certain threshold ( of about 3 nm ) the emission peak simply follows the qc model , while interface states would assume a crucial role only for small - sized ncs . anyway ,",
    "such consclusion was still unsatisfactory in many case .",
    "more recently , in a brilliant experiment godefroo et al.@xcite solved the puzzle demonstrating , by using magnetic fields to tune the qc and uv lasers to induce defects , that it is possible to reversibly control the origin of the pl by introducing or removing defects in a single sample : in the former case the pl originates from defects while in the latter case it originates from qc .",
    "+ previous works already highlighted the dramatic sensitivity of the opto - electronical properties to the si / sio@xmath0 interface configuration , especially for very small ncs ( @xmath1 nm ) , where a large proportion of the atoms is localized at the interface .",
    "in the latter case , several nc characteristics such as passivation , symmetry , and strain , considerably concur for the determination of the final opto - electronic response , producing sensible deviations from the simple qc model.@xcite moreover , many pl experiments demonstrated that only a very small fraction of the ncs in the samples contributes to the observed pl , enforcing the idea that precise structural conditions are required in order to achieve high emission rates.@xcite finally , recent calculations reported especially high optical yields for small ncs,@xcite , enhancing the weight held by their contribution in real samples .",
    "it is therefore clear the importance of understanding the factors that , at these sizes , contribute to enhance ( or reduce ) the nc optical response .",
    "embedding si - ncs in wide band - gap insulators is one way to obtain a strong qc .",
    "si - ncs embedded in a silica matrix have been obtained by several techniques as ion implantation,@xcite chemical vapour deposition,@xcite laser pyrolysis,@xcite electron beam lithography,@xcite sputtering,@xcite and some others .",
    "+ experimentally , several factors contribute to make the interpretation of measurements on these systems a difficult task .",
    "for instance , samples show some dispersion in the nc size , that is difficult to be controlled . in this case it is possible that the observed quantity does not correspond exactly to the mean size but instead to the most responsive ncs.@xcite moreover , ncs synthesized by different techniques often show different properties in size , shape and in the interface structure .",
    "finally , in solid nanocrystal arrays some collective effects caused by electron , photon , and phonon transfer between the ncs can strongly influence the electron dynamics in comparison with the case of isolated ncs.@xcite in practice , all the conditions remarked above lead to measurements of collective quantities , making the identification of the most active configurations at the experimental level a non trivial task .",
    "+ from the theoretical side , the possibility of atomically manipulating the structures and of associating the selected configuration to the calculated response allows in principle to elucidate some of the points raised above .",
    "however , it must be taken into account that an accurate characterization of the electronical properties requires a full _ ab - initio _ approach , limiting the systems size to a few thousands of atoms in the case of density functional theory ( dft ) methods .",
    "in addition , the calculation of realistic optical absorption or emission spectra , involving excited states , requires refined treatments that dramatically increase the computational effort , furtherly reducing the maximum manageable system size .",
    "+ in this work we present dft calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) of the ground - state electronic configuration of si - ncs of different size embedded in a sio@xmath0 matrix , both in the amorphous and in the crystalline phase .",
    "the reason for taking into account amorphous ncs is based on the fact that real samples are always characterized by a certain amount of amorphization , in particular for ncs of small diameter.@xcite the absorption spectra , represented by the imaginary part of the dielectric function , are then evaluated within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , with and without the inclusion of local field effects ( lfe ) .",
    "+ it is well known that the dft - lda severely underestimates the band gaps for semiconductors and insulators . a correction to the fundamental band gap",
    "is usually obtained by calculating the separate electron and hole quasiparticle energies via the gw method.@xcite in this method the self - energy @xmath2 is expanded in terms of the single particle green function @xmath3 and the screened coulomb interaction @xmath4 , and at the first order is truncated to the first term @xmath5 .",
    "the knowledge of the quasiparticle energies , however , is still not sufficient to correctly describe a process in which electron - hole pairs are created such as the light absorption process .",
    "if the electron and the hole , created during the absorption process , are considered as independent quasiparticles , the structures of the absorption spectrum are located at the differences between the corresponding single - quasiparticles excitation levels .",
    "however , the attractive interaction between the positively and negatively charged quasiparticles can lead to a strong shift of the peak positions as well as to distortions of the spectral lineshape , known as excitonic effects . within the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) framework such interaction",
    "is taken into account by the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for the polarizability.@xcite + an alternative approach to mbpt for the computation of neutral excitations is represented by time - dependent dft ( tddft).@xcite tddft is expected to be more efficient than the mbpt - based approach , however many conceptual and computational problems remains still unsolved preventing its application to complex systems.@xcite moreover , a recent comparison of the two techniques applied to si - ncs revealed that tddft does not take into account correctly the screened coulomb interaction , also for small ncs.@xcite + even if complex mbpt treatments should be invoked to include self - energy and excitonic effects , previous many - body calculations on si - ncs reported fundamental gaps@xcite and absorption spectra@xcite very close to the independent - particle calculated ones when lfe are neglected . in ref .",
    "we verified this statement for the si@xmath6 and a - si@xmath6 embedded ncs , showing that self - energy corrections ( calculated through the gw method ) and electron - hole coulomb corrections ( calculated through the bethe - salpeter equation ) nearly cancel out each other ( with a total correction to the gap smaller than 0.2 ev ) .",
    "these considerations justify our choice of dft - lda for the calculation of the optical properties of larger clusters , allowing a good compromise between results accuracy and computational effort .",
    "the crystalline embedded structures have been obtained from a betacristobalite cubic supercell by removing all the oxygens included in a cutoff - sphere , whose radius determines the size of the nc . by centering the cutoff - sphere on one silicon or in an interstitial position it is possible to obtain structures with different symmetries . to guarantee a proper shielding of the strain arising from the difference in the silicon / silica lattice spacing",
    ", we preserved a separation of about 1 nm between the ncs replica .",
    "+        the glass models have been generated using classical molecular dynamics simulations of quenching from a melt , followed by _",
    "ab - initio _ relaxations ( see ref .",
    "for further details ) .",
    "the amorphous dot structures have been obtained , like in the case of the crystalline systems , by applying the cutoff sphere on the glass supercells.@xcite it is worth to stress that also in the crystalline case the embedding matrix looses its symmetry after the inclusion of the nc , due to the metastable nature of the betacristobalite.@xcite + the relaxation of all the structures have been performed using the siesta code@xcite with a dzp basis set ( double-@xmath7 basis plus polarization orbitals ) and troullier - martins pseudopotentials with non - linear core corrections .",
    "a cutoff of 250 ry on the density and no additional external pressure or stress have been applied .",
    "atomic positions and cell parameters have been left totally free to move .",
    "+ following the procedure described above we have built three crystalline embedded nanostructures , si@xmath6 , si@xmath8 , si@xmath9 , and their respective amorphous counterparts , a - si@xmath6 , a - si@xmath8 , a - si@xmath9 .",
    "the structural characteristics of all the systems are reported in table [ table1 ] .",
    "+ in order to investigate the role of the embedding medium on the lfe we have also built the freestanding counterparts of the crystalline and amorphous si@xmath9 ncs by extracting the si - ncs from the silica , including or not the first shell of interface oxygens , and then by passivating the dangling bonds with hydrogen . in this way we have obtained four freestanding ncs : si@xmath9-(oh)@xmath10 , si@xmath9-h@xmath10 , a - si@xmath9-o@xmath11-h@xmath12 , a - si@xmath9-h@xmath13 . for such structures , in order to preserve the strain induced by the silica matrix on the ncs,@xcite we performed a structural relaxation on the sole hydrogens , while holding the position of the other atoms .",
    "the structural properties of the freestanding structures are therefore identical to the embedded ones .",
    "+ for each structure we have calculated the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the kohn - sham hamiltonian using the espresso package .",
    "@xcite calculations have been performed using norm - conserving pseudopotentials within the local density approximation ( lda ) with a ceperley - alder exchange - correlation potential , as parametrized by perdew - zunger .",
    "an energy cutoff of 60 ry on the plane wave basis set has been considered .",
    "+ once the ground - state geometry has been found , the absorption spectra have been computed at the dft - rpa level with and without the inclusion of lfe .",
    "the absorption spectrum , given by the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function @xmath14 , is connected to the inverse of the microscopic dielectric function @xmath15 through the so called ` macroscopic average':@xcite @xmath16 when lfe are neglected at the rpa level , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the coulomb interaction and @xmath19 is the irreducible rpa polarizability .",
    "this procedure is in fact exact in the case of an homogeneous system for which the off - diagonal terms of @xmath15 are null . on the other hand , when local fields ( lf ) are included the quantity @xmath20",
    "must be accessed .",
    "very briefly , @xmath21 is linked to the reducible polarizability @xmath22 by the relation @xmath23 . at the rpa level",
    "we have that @xmath24 .",
    "hence by calculating @xmath25 with @xmath26 single particle green function , we can obtain @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is widely known that lfe assume a crucial role for systems characterized by strong charge inhomegeneities . instead , for ordered systems like bulk - silicon and betacristobalite ,",
    "lfe tend to vanish out.@xcite besides , the same rule applies also for completely amorphized systems , like silica - glasses , that at last behave as homogeneous materials.@xcite in the case of si / sio@xmath0 heterostructures , the inhomogeneity is represented by the interface that the nc forms with the surrounding silica , and it is therefore important to investigate the role of lf for systems with different interface conditions .",
    "freestanding ncs , with ( dashed line ) and without ( solid line ) the contribution of local fields : ( a ) crystalline oh - terminated , ( b ) crystalline h - terminated , ( c ) amorphous oh - terminated , ( d ) amorphous h - terminated .",
    "the spectra are in arbitrary units .",
    "_ , height=321 ]    it is worth to note that lfe have a strong influence at every nc size .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous works reporting high lfe on very large nanostructures , suggesting that they arise almost entirely by classical effects.@xcite in addition , we observe similar trends of the spectra of the two largest ncs ( si@xmath9 and a - si@xmath9 ) .",
    "this supports the idea that for large ncs the response should depend mainly on the ipe and not on the amorphization degree , nor on the particular geometry of the si / sio@xmath0 interface . finally , differently from ref .",
    ", we observe similar absorption magnitudes for different ncs size ( especially in the more realistic case of amorphous ncs ) , in agreement with recent experimental observations.@xcite + the comparison of the lf spectra of figs .",
    "[ fig.lf-vs-nlf]c,[fig.lf-vs-nlf]f with experimental measurements on 1nm - sized si / sio@xmath0 ncs show a nice match of the absorption profile and of the maximum absorption energy located at about 6 ev.@xcite    in order to discuss the role of the embedding medium we have considered also the case of freestanding ncs . in ref .",
    "we showed that , while the freestanding hydrogenated ncs present a larger band - gap and miss oxygen - related states at the band - edge , the nc+interface system is able ( when the strain induced by the embedding matrix is preserved ) to nicely reproduce the characteristics of the full nc+sio@xmath0 system .",
    "+ in figure [ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended ] we report the absorption spectra for the set of freestanding si@xmath9 ncs , with and without the inclusion of the lfe .",
    "first of all we note that the nlf results confirm the point remarked above : the nlf spectra of the oh - terminated ncs ( figs .",
    "[ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]a and [ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]c ) well match those of the corresponding embedded ncs in the 06 ev range , while both the nlf spectra of the hydrogenated ncs ( figs .",
    "[ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]b and [ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]d ) present some modifications and a blue - shift of about 0.5 ev on the main peak .",
    "also the lf spectra of the nc+interface systems match nicely those of the corresponding full systems , evidencing a strong screening in the 04 ev range and a blue - shift of about 2 ev on the main peak .",
    "these spectra are nicely comparable with those of ref",
    ". obtained by an effective - medium approach from experimental measurements on embedded ncs .",
    "it is worth to stress that in our samples the crystallinity degree and the amorphization degree are intentionally maximized .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to observe spectra of real 1nm - sized ncs lying in - between those of figs .",
    "[ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]a and [ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]c . + in the case of hydrogenated ncs the lfe become of dramatic proportions , with severe screening effects and a shifting of the main peak of about 5 ev , both ascribable ( by the model discussed above ) to a faster response of the iterface polarization . at last",
    "it is worth noticing that , as already evidenced for the embedded case , the introduction of lfe produces spectra that are poorly dependent on the amorphization degree .",
    "this consideration , together with the fact that in real samples the smaller ncs tend to remain amorphous,@xcite is positive in photovoltaics applications , where an efficient harvesting of the sunlight spectrum is required .",
    "the small variation of the response on the amorphization degree is in this case an advantage , because any variation could rule the smallest ncs out of the absorption process .",
    "+ in the last part of this section we investigate on the different contributions of si - nc , interface , and enclosing environment , to the absorption spectra .",
    "+ in figure [ fig.pdos ] we report the density of states ( dos ) projected on the nc silicons , nc+interface , and all the atoms , of the embedded and freestanding si@xmath9 systems . all the projected dos ( pdos ) have been normalized following the constraint @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dos projected on the nc silicons , and @xmath46 is the fermi energy located half - between the energy band gap .",
    "+ in the case of embedded ncs ( figs .",
    "[ fig.pdos]a , [ fig.pdos]d ) the contribution due to the interface - oxygens is very small concerning the conduction band while it assumes an important role in the valence band , especially for energies below -1 ev ( -2 ev in the amorphous case ) .",
    "it follows that , at least at the nlf level , the absorption below @xmath473.4 ev ( @xmath472.9 ev in the amorphous case ) is mostly due to states localized on the nc , while at higher energies also interface - to - nc transitions occur . as expected , the pdos for the oh - terminated ncs ( figs .",
    "[ fig.pdos]b , [ fig.pdos]e ) closely reproduce those of the corresponding embedded counterparts , confirming the idea that the nc+interface system is non - interacting with the remaining atoms.@xcite instead , in the hydrogenated case the pdos of the ncs present a raising in the -2    -5 ev region with respect to the other systems , that is responsible for the increased absorption in the 68 ev ( see nlf spectra of figs .",
    "[ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]b , [ fig.lf-vs-nlf_suspended]d ) .",
    "local field effects ( lfe ) have a great influence on the optical absorption of silicon nanoclusters ( si - ncs ) , and must be included for a realistic description of the optical response .",
    "their effect arise from the polarizations occurring at the nc interface ( ipe ) , and they are therefore particularly sensitive to the details of the nc termination .",
    "+ the ipe depend on the energy of the incoming field . at low energies the incoming field and the induced polarizations are in - phase , resulting in a screened effective field and a subsequent damping of the absorption .",
    "contrary , at high energies the polarizations are not able to follow the fast oscillations of the incoming field , and lfe tend to vanish out .",
    "besides , at energies for which the incoming field and the induced polarization are opportunely dephased , the former becomes anti - screened , leading to a maximized absorption .",
    "therefore , the final ( corrected ) spectrum appears reduced and blue - shifted , by magnitudes that depend on the interface polarizability conditions . in presence of interface oxygens , as for freestanding like as for embedded ncs , the lfe produce a severe reduction of the absorption up to 4 ev , and a blue - shift on the main peak settling around 2 ev . in the case of hydrogenated ncs",
    "the lfe are of dramatic proportions , with a severe damping of the absorption in the 04 ev energy range , and a blue - shift attaining an impressive value of about 5 ev .",
    "interestingly , in all the case considered , while the uncorrected spectra show an important sensitivity to the structural configuration of the ncs ( amorphization ) , lfe tend to smooth out such differences in favor of a more consistent description of the absorption characteristic .",
    "this result suggests the possibility of relying on simpler methods for the evaluation of the lfe , like the effective medium theories as already suggested for other silicon nanostructures.@xcite such a simplification would be especially convenient when considering larger ncs , requiring to date prohibitive computational efforts with the current model .",

    "<S> the effect of the local fields on the absorption spectra of silicon nanoclusters ( ncs ) , freestanding or embedded in sio@xmath0 , is investigated in the dft - rpa framework for different size and amorphization of the samples . </S>",
    "<S> we show that local field effects have a great influence on the optical absorption of the ncs . </S>",
    "<S> their effect can be described by two separate contributions , both arising from polarization effects at the nc interface . </S>",
    "<S> first , local fields produce a reduction of the absorption that is stronger in the low energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution is a direct consequence of the screening induced by polarization effects on the incoming field . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , local fields cause a blue - shift on the main absorption peak that has been explained in terms of perturbation of the absorption resonance conditions . </S>",
    "<S> both contributions do not depend neither on the nc diameter nor on its amorphization degree , while showing a high sensitivity to the environment enclosing the ncs .    </S>",
