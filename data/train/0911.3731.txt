    "in the present paper we continue the series of works @xcite on the xxz model . in @xcite",
    "we considered it in the presence of the matsubara direction , or equivalently the six vertex model on a cylinder .",
    "we computed the normalised partition function with a defect localised between two horizontal lines , which corresponds to an insertion of a quasi - local operator : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is related to the coupling parameter ( see below ) , and @xmath2 stands for the monodromy matrix on the two tensor products of evaluation representations of @xmath3 : one for the horizontal ( or ` space ' ) direction @xmath4 , and another for the vertical ( or matsubara ) direction @xmath5 . for more details see section [ xxz ] below , in particular _ fig .",
    "1_. it was important in @xcite to incorporate inhomogeneities in the matsubara chain .",
    "this allows , for example , to consider the temperature expectation values in the spirit of @xcite , by adjusting inhomogeneities and taking the limit to the infinite chain in the matsubara direction .",
    "the clue to our calculation was the introduction of operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xcite which , by acting on the primary field @xmath9 , create the space of quasi - local operators on the horizontal chain . more precisely , quasi - local operators are created by taylor coefficients of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 at the point @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we change the definition of @xmath7 , @xmath8 from those of @xcite by applying certain bogolubov transformation .",
    "compared with the original ones , they have better asymptotic properties .",
    "we shall explain this in section [ xxz ] .",
    "there is an obvious similarity with conformal field theory ( cft ) , where the descendants are created from the primary field by the action of the virasoro algebra .",
    "our aim in this paper is to examine the scaling limit of our construction in the critical regime , and to establish its precise relation with cft .",
    "we shall consider the case of a homogeneous matsubara chain .",
    "the functional is non - trivial only for operators @xmath11 of spin zero .",
    "as it turns out , for the study of the scaling limit , it is quite useful to relax this restriction .",
    "we shall first introduce the following generalisation of which is of interest on its own right .",
    "for @xmath12 we define @xmath13 where the @xmath14 s denote the coefficients of the singular part of @xmath7 at @xmath15 . when @xmath16 , a similar definition is in force using the expansion coefficients of @xmath8 . as long as @xmath17 is taken generically ,",
    "this definition is independent of its choice ( see section [ xxz ] for more details ) . in general the dependence on @xmath17 enters , but only in a  topological \" way .",
    "needless to say , what we we are dealing with is a lattice analogue of the screening operators ` a la feigin - fuchs - dotsenko - fateev @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that quasi - local operators and screening operators both arise from the same operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , as expansions either around @xmath10 or @xmath15 .",
    "after these modifications the main formula of @xcite remains valid .",
    "it reads @xmath18 where the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined by the data of the matsubara direction .",
    "we refer to this formula as the determinant formula . due to the bogolubov transformation of @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "the function @xmath23 is slightly different from @xmath24 used in @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to the scaling limit .",
    "we have two twisted transfer matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the matsubara direction .",
    "as the the number of sites @xmath27 becomes large , their bethe roots tend to distribute densely on @xmath28 .",
    "fixing @xmath29 and introducing the step of the lattice @xmath30 , we consider the limit @xmath31 at the same time we rescale the spectral parameter as @xmath32 so that the bethe roots close to @xmath33 stay finite in terms of the variable @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is a constant chosen for fine tuning ( see section [ contmatsubara ] , ) . in this limit",
    "the twisted transfer matrices turn into the transfer matrices of chiral cft on the cylinder @xmath36 , introduced and studied by bazhanov , lukyanov and zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "we wish to mention here that the present work owes a great deal to these remarkable papers without which it would have been impossible .",
    "details about the scaling limit can be found in section [ contmatsubara ] below .",
    "the relevant cft has central charge @xmath37 we shall parametrise the conformal dimension as @xmath38 and write the action of the virasoro algebra on a local field @xmath39 as @xmath40 .    in the following we set @xmath41 , and let @xmath42 indicate the scaling limit , .",
    "the functions entering the determinant formula also have finite limits , @xmath43 where @xmath44 so all these partition functions have finite limits .",
    "they should have some definite meaning in the context of cft .",
    "we contend that they are the three point functions of the descendants of the chiral primary field @xmath45 , computed in the presence of two other primary fields ( or their descendants ) inserted at the two ends of the cylinder .",
    "more specifically , we conjecture that the following picture holds true .",
    "first , the creation operators tend to a limit , @xmath46 as @xmath47 , these operators have asymptotic expansions of the form @xmath48 in the limit , the quasi - local operator @xmath9 becomes the product of two chiral primary fields @xmath49 .",
    "the operators @xmath50 and the quadratic combinations @xmath51 act only on the left component @xmath45 , and create the entire verma module spanned by the virasoro descendants @xmath52 furthermore , if @xmath53 is chosen to be generic then @xmath54 in the right hand side , the symbol @xmath55 stands for the three point function normalised as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 inserted at @xmath58 and the primary fields @xmath59 , @xmath60 being inserted at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ( see below ) .",
    "non - generic choice of @xmath53 corresponds to replacing the primary fields at @xmath63 by their descendants . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the case of generic @xmath53 .",
    "the coefficients in are homogeneous operators in the sense that @xmath64 = ( 2j-1){\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\tau$}}^*_{2j-1 } , \\quad   \\left[\\ \\mathbf{l}_0\\ , , { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}}^*_{2i-1}{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\gamma$}}^*_{2j-1}\\right ] = ( 2i+2j-2){\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}}^*_{2i-1 }   { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\gamma$}}^*_{2j-1 } \\,.\\ ] ] hence , for each degree , the descendants created by @xmath65 s , and those created by @xmath50 s , @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s , must be finite linear combinations of each other .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show , for low degrees , that this is indeed the case , and that the coefficients can be found explicitly .    to determine the coefficients of the linear combination",
    ", we compare the values of @xmath68 . for the virasoro descendants ,",
    "they can be easily computed by the conformal ward - takahashi identities . for the descendants by @xmath50 and others",
    ", we need the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in section [ asymp - loga ]",
    "we develop a systematic method for computing them .",
    "we note that in both cases the results are polynomials in the conformal dimensions @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "we may regard them as independent variables and compare the coefficients , since @xmath73 in can take any integer values .",
    "this was one of reasons for us to introduce the screening operators .",
    "we consider first @xmath50 .",
    "cft allows an integrable structure based on zamolodchikov s integrals of motion @xmath74 @xcite . with the above procedure",
    "we are led to a result which should not be surprising , @xmath75 where @xmath76 are some @xmath77-dependent constants which can be found in @xcite .",
    "we then consider the action of @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s . because of a technical difficulty we have not been able to compute the asymptotics of @xmath70 for @xmath78 .",
    "here we restrict to the case @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 for any @xmath81 , restricting to @xmath79 means that we consider the quotient space of the verma module modulo the action of the integrals of motion .",
    "we assume that the vectors @xmath82 span the verma module , so the quotient space is created by the @xmath83 s . with primary fields as asymptotical states , we can compare up to the level 6 .",
    "it should be added , however , that up to this level the system of equations is overdetermined .",
    "so the very possibility of finding a solution is the strongest support of our fermionic picture .",
    "we give one example on the level 4 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 in the right hand side , we have a particular combination of the virasoro descendants .",
    "this equation says that its three - point function remains of the same determinant form before and after integrable perturbation .",
    "the text is organised as follows . in section [ xxz ]",
    "we review the results of @xcite and describe the bogolubov transformation mentioned above . in section [ rhomega ]",
    "we define the functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in section [ screenings ]",
    "we define screening operators on the lattice , and describe a generalisation of the previous results . in section [ scaling ]",
    "we start discussing the scaling limit of the xxz chain , examining the behaviour of the bethe roots in the matsubara direction as the length of the chain becomes infinite .",
    "sections [ cft ] and [ reviewblz ] are a review of the cft integrals of motion on the cylinder , and the series of works of bazhanov , lukyanov and zamolodchikov ( blz ) .",
    "we explain in section [ contmatsubara ] how the matsubara transfer matrix turns into that of blz in the continuous limit . in section [ cftlimitspace ]",
    "we discuss the cft interpretation of the scaling limit in the space direction .",
    "in section [ asymp - loga ] we study the asymptotics of thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) function @xmath88 for cft . in section [ asymp - omega ]",
    "we find the asymptotical expansion of @xmath87 for @xmath89 . in section",
    "[ final ] we compare descendants created by @xmath83 with those created by @xmath66 s and @xmath67 and give some concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "we present general properties of asymptotics of @xmath87 which apply to the case @xmath90 .",
    "let us start with a brief review of the papers @xcite . consider the xxz spin chain in the infinite volume .",
    "the space of states of the model is @xmath91 and the hamiltonian is given by @xmath92 we consider the critical xxz model in the following range of the coupling , @xmath93    together with @xmath94 we consider the matsubara space @xmath95 . in @xcite",
    "the most general case was treated : namely , @xmath95 was the tensor product of spaces of different dimensions , and to every site @xmath96 an independent inhomogeneity parameter @xmath97 was attached . in the present paper",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the case @xmath98    we consider the monodromy matrix @xmath99 .",
    "mathematically this is nothing but the image of the universal @xmath100 matrix of @xmath3 on the tensor product of evaluation representations corresponding to @xmath101 and @xmath95 .",
    "it has been said that we shall consider a homogeneous matsubara chain only . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "this correspond to setting @xmath102 for all @xmath96 .",
    "we shall absorb this into redefinition of the @xmath103-operator comparing to @xcite .",
    "let us write the definition explicitly : @xmath104 where @xmath105 with @xmath106    a local operator @xmath11 on @xmath107 is by definition an operator which acts nontrivially only on a finite number of the tensor components @xmath108 of @xmath107 .",
    "more generally we consider quasi - local operators with tail @xmath109 , which are operators of the form @xmath110 with @xmath11 being local . in this notation @xmath111",
    "is the total spin . in @xcite",
    "we computed the expectation values defined by @xmath112 this is a linear functional on the space @xmath113 of spinless quasi - local operators with tail @xmath109 .",
    "it is helpful to think of the functional @xmath114 as a ratio of partition functions of the six vertex model on the cylinder .",
    "for example , the numerator of can be presented graphically as follows .",
    ".5 cm .5 cm .5 cm _",
    "fig.1 : partition function on the cylinder .",
    "+ the functional @xmath115 is a ratio of two partition functions on the cylinder . on each crossing of a row and a column ,",
    "one associates the boltzmann weights of the six vertex model . on a particular row",
    "there are also twist fields @xmath116 ( marked by crosses ) and @xmath117 ( marked by circles ) . the numerator of @xmath115 corresponds to a lattice with defects representing an insertion of a local operator .",
    "_    .5 cm    on this picture the summation is performed over all edges except the broken ones in the middle .",
    "the arrows on the broken edges are fixed , representing the local operator @xmath11 .",
    "the one dimensional sublattice going in the infinite space direction will be called the space chain , while the compact one dimensional sublattice in the matsubara direction will be referred to as the matsubara chain .",
    "we computed the expectation values using the fermionic description of @xmath113 found in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall it . consider the space @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes the space of quasi - local operators of spin @xmath73 with tail @xmath120 .",
    "we have the creation operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the annihilation operators @xmath121 , @xmath122 which act on @xmath123 . to be precise the operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 were defined in @xcite as formal power series in @xmath124 , the quasi - local operators in @xmath123 are created by coefficients of these series",
    ". however , when the series are substituted into @xmath114 the result allows analytical continuation .",
    "so , in the present paper we shall adopt another point of view which is similar to that of cft .",
    "namely , we shall consider the operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 as analytical functions .",
    "then the relation to real quasi - local operators is achieved by considering @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 around the point @xmath10 .",
    "the creation - annihilation operators have the block structures @xmath125 the operator @xmath126 plays a special role : it is the right shift by one site along the space chain .",
    "we have @xmath127_+=\\psi ( \\xi/{\\zeta},{\\alpha}),\\quad   \\bigl [   { \\mathbf{b}}(\\xi),{\\mathbf{b}}^*({\\zeta } )   \\bigr]_+=-\\psi ( { \\zeta}/\\xi,{\\alpha})\\,,{\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 the operators in the space @xmath113 are created from the primary field @xmath9 by action of @xmath129 s and of equal number of @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s .",
    "the completeness @xcite says that the entire space @xmath130 is generated by coefficients of the creation operators considered as series in @xmath124 .",
    "certainly , this description is reminiscent of cft .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the following relations which allow for recursive computations of the expectation values : @xmath131 where @xmath132 goes around all the singularities of the integrand except @xmath133 .",
    "we think no further explanation is needed nowadays when the method of cft is a part of common knowledge .",
    "the functions @xmath134 and @xmath135 will be defined in section [ rhomega ] .",
    "we changed the notation for the former from to @xcite .",
    "the present notation agrees better with the explicit formula given below .",
    "the set of equations , , implies a determinant representation for the expectation values @xcite , we shall discuss this later .",
    "let us describe the modification of @xmath7 , @xmath8 by a bogolubov transformation which was mentioned in the introduction . denoting the operators used in @xcite by @xmath136 , @xmath137 ,",
    "define @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the following finite difference operator of the second order , @xmath140 the function @xmath141 is transcendental .",
    "for @xmath142 we define it as @xmath143 where the principal value is taken with regards to the pole at @xmath144 .",
    "in general we define it by analytic continuation with respect to both @xmath109 and @xmath145 , obtaining a meromorphic function of @xmath146 .",
    "it is bounded at @xmath147 , and its singularities closest to the real axis are the simple poles at @xmath148 with residues of opposite signs .",
    "the function @xmath149 is regular at @xmath150 , so the taylor series for @xmath7 , @xmath8 at @xmath10 are well - defined .",
    "the function @xmath87 changes following the change of @xmath21 , @xmath22 : @xmath151 where @xmath152    let us mention one marvellous property of our modified operators @xmath21 , @xmath22",
    ".    the main subject of our original study @xcite was the following normalised matrix element @xmath153 where @xmath154 denotes the ground state of the xxz hamiltonian in the infinite volume .",
    "equivalently , the numerator of is the partition function of the six vertex model on the plane with a defect localised between two horizontal lines .",
    "it is easy to see using the formulae from @xcite that , if we create the quasi - local fields by the operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , then @xmath155 vanishes on all of them with the sole exception of the descendants created by @xmath126 . for the latter we have @xmath156    we know from the algebraic construction @xcite that the taylor coefficients of the part @xmath157 , @xmath158 in produce only rational functions of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "hence all transcendental pieces of the expectation values come from rewriting a given quasi - local operator in the fermionic basis and picking taylor coefficients of the function @xmath161 .",
    "the property of @xmath6 ( except @xmath162 ) and @xmath7 , @xmath8 mentioned above is analogous to that of the virasoro generators in cft : on the riemann sphere , all normalised one point functions of the descendants vanish due to the conformal invariance . strictly speaking , the one point function of the primary field also vanishes ,",
    "so a word of clarification is necessary .",
    "take a massive model with a mass scale @xmath163 and consider the conformal limit @xmath164 .",
    "while the normalised one point function of the primary field stays equal to @xmath165 , those of the descendants vanish in the limit , because for dimensional reasons they contain additional powers of @xmath163 .    at this point one",
    "may wonder why we did not do the bogolubov transformation killing completely the function @xmath87 in , .",
    "the answer is that it is impossible to rewrite the left hand sides of , because the function @xmath87 can not be written as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "introduce the twisted matsubara transfer matrix : @xmath166 let @xmath167 be the eigenvector of @xmath168 whose eigenvalue is maximal in the absolute value . similarly let @xmath169 be the eigencovector of @xmath170 whose eigenvalue is maximal in the absolute value .",
    "it is well - known that these eigenvectors have spin @xmath33 .",
    "we call them the maximal eigenvectors , and assume that they are not orthogonal .",
    "we denote the eigenvalues of @xmath171 ( resp .",
    "@xmath172 ) on @xmath167 ( resp .",
    "@xmath169 ) by @xmath173 ( resp .",
    "@xmath174 ) .    then @xmath175 is defined by @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "we have @xmath178 the function @xmath179 is more complicated . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it is completely determined by two requirement : the singular part and the normalisation condition .",
    "then they were explicitly solved in terms @xmath159-deformed abelian integrals . in the present paper",
    "it is convenient to use an alternative , tba - like , description used in @xcite .",
    "let us explain this simplifying a little the notation of @xcite .    together with the transfer matrix @xmath26 we consider in @xcite baxter s @xmath180-operators @xmath181 .",
    "in this paper we use only one of them : @xmath182 denoting it just as @xmath183 .",
    "it is defined by the trace over the highest weight representation of the @xmath159-oscillator algebra with generators @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 ( see @xcite for notation ) , @xmath187 where @xmath188 its eigenvalue on the eigenvector discussed above will be denoted by @xmath189 . the main role in tba",
    "is played by the function : @xmath190 where @xmath191 it follows from the baxter equation that the solutions to the equation @xmath192 are the zeros of either @xmath189 or @xmath193",
    ". the function @xmath194 satisfies the nonlinear integral equation @xcite : @xmath195 where the cycle @xmath196 goes around the zeros of @xmath189 ( bethe roots ) in the _ clockwise _ direction , as opposed to all other contours .",
    "we shall need slightly more general kernel than @xmath197 , so , let us define them together .",
    "first , we introduce operations : @xmath198 then @xmath199    we shall use the the following notation : @xmath200 where the measure is given by @xmath201    now we introduce the resolvent of certain integral operator @xmath202 where @xmath203 stands for the integral operator with the kernel @xmath204 . introducing further the two kernels @xmath205 we are ready to write the definition of @xcite",
    "cleaning it from irrelevant auxiliary objects and taking into account the modification : @xmath206",
    "now we want to describe an important generalisation of results of @xcite .",
    "we have three constants : @xmath109 which defines the tail of the operator and @xmath207 , @xmath208 which define the twist of matsubara transfer matrices at @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "as it has been said in the introduction we need more freedom .",
    "let us explain how an additional parameter @xmath211 can be introduced into @xmath114 .",
    "we shall see later that in the scaling limit introduction of this parameter leads to emancipation of @xmath212 from @xmath207 and @xmath109 .",
    "let us consider the trace @xmath213 where @xmath214 carries spin @xmath215 . for definiteness",
    "we suppose @xmath12 .",
    "it follows from the ice condition that in this situation the operator @xmath216 must have spin @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that among the eigenvectors of the transfer matrices @xmath26 and @xmath217 there are maximal ones @xmath167 , @xmath218 with eigenvalues @xmath176 and @xmath219 which are defined by the requirement that @xmath220 is of maximal absolute value among all the pairs of eigenvectors .",
    "we assume further the generality condition : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the coefficients of the series can be calculated by taylor expanding the integrand and applying @xmath674 the first non - trivial term reads @xmath675    returning to the original variables @xmath299 and @xmath676 , formula for @xmath677 can be obtained from .",
    "we have @xmath678 where @xmath679 is important only in @xmath680 .",
    "notice that originally in @xmath681 we had rather @xmath682 .",
    "the change appeared due to addition of @xmath683 which explains the importance of this term . picking the residues at the poles in the upper half plane , its asymptotics as @xmath684",
    "can be calculated : @xmath685 where @xmath686 and @xmath687 the counterpart of the factorisation for @xmath601 is the vanishing property @xmath688 this ensures that the coefficients @xmath689 are polynomials in @xmath71 , @xmath690 and @xmath644 .",
    "for instance , @xmath691 here @xmath643 are given in  , and @xmath692 these structures",
    "exhibit a remarkable consistency with our fermionic picture .",
    "now we clearly see the structure of our fermions in the cft limit .",
    "they naturally split into two parts : @xmath693 the multipliers @xmath694 , @xmath695 absorb all the transcendental dependence on @xmath109 , the operators @xmath696 , @xmath697 are purely cft - objects .    the fermions act between different verma modules .",
    "in order to stay in one verma module it is convenient to introduce the bilinear combinations of fermions @xmath698    the verma module has a basis consisting of the vectors @xmath699 conjecturally the same space is also created by the action of the @xmath700 s and fermions : @xmath701 for small degrees , the transition coefficients between and , modulo descendants of the @xmath700 , can be determined by taking the expectation values with @xmath79 and equating like powers of @xmath207 .",
    "abbreviating @xmath702 and writing @xmath703 as @xmath347 , we find @xmath704    at the next degree , there are @xmath705 virasoro descendants @xmath706 , @xmath707 , @xmath708 , @xmath709 , @xmath710 , which are polynomials in @xmath71 of degree @xmath711 , respectively . with the data at hand ,",
    "obtained from the primary field @xmath59 , there remains one parameter undetermined .",
    "this can be fixed considering the first descendent @xmath712 which we hope to do in future .",
    "nevertheless we have checked that the determinant , @xmath713 after subtracting a suitable multiple of @xmath706 , has the correct degree @xmath714 in @xmath71 .",
    "we regard it as a further supporting evidence in favour of the fermionic structure .",
    "let us pass to conclusions .",
    "we believe that the fermionic description will provide new results for the theory of integrable models .",
    "for example , there is an obvious similarity between our fermions and those introduced in @xcite . with the formulae at hand",
    ", it should be possible to upgrade the qualitative description of form factors of descendants in @xcite to a quantitative level .",
    "we hope to explain this in future works . here , however , we would like to emphasise that , even for cft , the fermionic description must give something completely new .",
    "let us explain that .",
    "consider the functional @xmath715 with @xmath79 .",
    "it describes the three point function for descendants of @xmath716 and two primary fields @xmath717 , @xmath59 of equal dimension @xmath718 .",
    "it was said several times that the construction generalises if we replace the asymptotic states described by @xmath515 , by any other eigenstate of the integrals of motion @xmath401 .",
    "the only change is that the function @xmath87 is to be computed for the new asymptotic condition .",
    "it is assumed @xcite that the joint spectrum of @xmath401 is simple , so , in this way we compute all the three - point functions for a descendant of @xmath716 and descendants of @xmath717 , @xmath59 provided the latter are eigenstates of the integrals of motion .",
    "notice that the descendant of @xmath515 can be very deep in the verma module . in that case",
    "the usual cft computation is rather hard to perform .",
    "let us be more precise appealing to the classical limit .    in the classical limit @xmath265 ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath401 are in correspondence with the periodic solutions of the kdv equation .",
    "let us give some explanation about this point .",
    "consider the classical kdv hierarchy with the second poisson structure : @xmath719 the integrability of the kdv equation is due to existence of the auxiliary linear problem : @xmath720 we consider the periodic case @xmath721 . in this case one",
    "defines the monodromy matrix @xmath722 for the auxiliary linear problem in a standard way .",
    "then the local integrals of motion in involution are found in the asymptotical expansion of @xmath723 for @xmath724 : @xmath725 where @xmath726 the integrals of motion @xmath727 are well - known functionals of @xmath728 .",
    "here we use for them the normalisation of @xcite .",
    "so , the classical limit is @xmath729 it brings the virasoro commutation relations to the second poisson structure of the kdv hierarchy , and ensures the finite limits @xmath730    it is well known that periodic solutions of kdv are in correspondence with hyper - elliptic riemann surfaces which are two - fold covering of the riemann sphere of @xmath444 . in particular , the solution corresponding after the quantisation to the primary field @xmath515 corresponds to the riemann surface of genus 0 : @xmath731 from the point of view of classical theory , this is a completely trivial case which describes a constant solution of kdv .",
    "this case becomes non - trivial after the quantisation , because kdv is a theory with infinitely many degrees of freedom , and quantising the simplest classical solution one has to take into account infinitely many zero oscillations ( see @xcite for a relevant discussion ) .",
    "still it is rather unpleasant to be able to quantise only trivial classical solutions .",
    "the consideration of usual , low - lying descendants of @xmath59 does not change the situation seriously : they describe excitations for the same classical solution .",
    "what are really interesting solutions in the classical case ? they correspond to other riemann surfaces .",
    "the simplest one is described by the elliptic curve : @xmath732 at the quantum level , this solution corresponds to the following distribution of the bethe roots over the real axis in the plane of @xmath444 .",
    "going from @xmath733 we first have no bethe roots .",
    "then there is a large interval where the bethe roots are dense .",
    "then there is a large interval without the bethe roots , wherein we find one or several zeros of @xmath734 . then starting from certain point and up to @xmath735 , the bethe roots are again dense .    for a reader",
    "who is not familiar with periodic solutions of kdv , it is useful to think about this solution as a periodic analogue of one - soliton solution which we really obtain in the limit @xmath736",
    ". everybody would agree that quantising only the trivial solutions when there are solitons around is a waste of possibility .",
    "our fermionic construction gives a possibility to treat this kind of asymptotic states .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the function @xmath87 has a clear algebra - geometric meaning in the classical limit .",
    "we hope to return to all that in one of our future publications .",
    "in this section we derive the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath737 when @xmath738 .",
    "the main point of the argument is that in a certain domain , which we call a - domain , the expansion of @xmath739 holds for both @xmath299 and @xmath740 , and by the cancellation due to @xmath741 we have @xmath742 .",
    "we shall suppress the arguments @xmath207 , @xmath264 and @xmath109 in @xmath314 and @xmath737 .",
    "we set @xmath743 for @xmath744 , after simple computations we get : @xmath745 the symbol @xmath655 stands for integration over the contour @xmath196 going clockwise around the zeros of @xmath302 with the measure @xmath746 here again @xmath655 , @xmath656 and @xmath651 are slightly different than those used in section [ rhomega ] or section [ asymp - omega ] , but this should not cause any confusion .",
    "the measure @xmath656 has simple poles at the zeros of @xmath747 and @xmath748 . for simplicity of presentation",
    ", we assume @xmath207 and @xmath262 are close enough so that any zero of @xmath748 is smaller than any zero of @xmath747 .      from @xcite one concludes that @xmath753 where @xmath754 are some functions taking positive values in corresponding domains .",
    "hence @xmath755 decays rapidly in the upper half plane and grows rapidly in the lower half plane .",
    "following @xcite we write in the integral over the upper bank in using @xmath756 in order to separate the rapidly decreasing part . to formalise the story we introduce the notation @xmath757 where @xmath758 here @xmath759 is an arbitrary point lying between the largest zero of @xmath760 and the smallest zero of @xmath302 , and",
    "the modified measure is @xmath761    introduce the resolvent @xmath100 by the equation @xmath762 and two `` dressed '' kernels : @xmath763 where the functions @xmath764 , @xmath765 are defined in .",
    "they are singular at @xmath766 . according to our general prescription",
    "we understand real @xmath444 in them as @xmath767 and then continue analytically .",
    "the equation for the resolvent takes the form @xmath768 and the definition of @xmath87 can be rewritten as @xmath769 now we are ready to study the asymptotical behaviour .",
    "we shall consider @xmath444 and @xmath770 in the a - domain defined as follows : @xmath771 .",
    "we prove the correct asymptotic behaviour there , then assume that it is valid for all @xmath772 .",
    "the latter assumption is not even necessary for our goals , but we do not see why it should not be true having in mind that the only infinite series of poles of @xmath773 are the zeros of @xmath301 which accumulate to @xmath733 .    the importance of a - domain is due to the fact that in it @xmath774 introduce the operation @xmath775 using the definitions it is not hard to show that for @xmath444 , @xmath770 in a - domain @xmath776 these equations imply @xmath777 it is easy to argue that @xmath778 , @xmath779 grow for @xmath780 as powers of @xmath781 .",
    "this is enough to ensure that the `` connected part '' @xmath782 has the desired asymptotics : we just substitute the asymptotics into the formula for @xmath782 and observe that all the integrals converge because of exponential in @xmath781 decay of @xmath783 . with the `` disconnected part ''",
    "@xmath784 the situation is far more delicate , studying it we shall understand the importance of the term @xmath785 in @xmath773 .",
    "let us evaluate the last term in @xmath784 considering @xmath786 . using the definition it is easy to see that @xmath787 the function @xmath788 allows analytical continuation with respect to @xmath781 , so , we shall use it for all @xmath789 . substite @xmath790 and compute the integral @xmath791 we get after some straightforward computations @xmath792 where @xmath793 where the principal value refers to the pole at @xmath794 .",
    "consider @xmath797 .",
    "we check the equations @xmath798 the first of them follows immediately from two facts .",
    "first , @xmath799 second , writing explicitly @xmath800 and recalling the asymptotic expansion for @xmath801 , @xmath802 , we see that asymptotically for @xmath724 , @xmath803 the singularities in disappear .",
    "altogether we have for the asymptotics in both arguments @xmath804 to prove the second equation in it is not sufficient to use because @xmath788 has simple poles at @xmath794 and @xmath805 which contribute to the analytic continuation @xmath806 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the corresponding contributions cancel .    using the first of equations we get @xmath807 where due to the functions @xmath808",
    "are given by convergent integrals .",
