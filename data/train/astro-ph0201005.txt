    "observations of pulsar glitches , in addition to providing insights into the phenomenon itself , offer one of the few probes of neutron star structure , and thus the physics of ultra - dense matter .",
    "vela is the brightest known radio pulsar , and as it is at a declination of -45@xmath1 , it is above the horizon at the hobart radio observatory ( mount pleasant ) for more than 18 hours a day .",
    "it undergoes large glitches in pulse rate every few years and so provides an excellent probe of the physics of glitches .    since 1981 the university of tasmania has devoted a 14 m diameter antenna at its mt pleasant observatory to measurements of arrival times of pulses from the vela pulsar . during this time we have observed 7 large glitches , or sudden decreases , in the period of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the telescope has a single pulse observing system whose speed and sensitivity have been enhanced in order to answer a number of questions ; how quickly does the crust accelerate to the new period during a glitch , how soon does the recovery from the glitch start , and what is the form of this recovery ?    on 2000",
    "january 16 ( mjd 51559 ) the rate of pulsation jumped with a fractional period change of @xmath0 , the largest recorded for this pulsar .",
    "the glitch was automatically detected and we issued an iau telegram @xcite within 12 hours , allowing the x - ray telescope , chandra , to make target of opportunity ( too ) observations @xcite .",
    "these observations have so far failed to find the signature of neutron star heating , which was the driver for the too , but have produced spectacular images of the x - ray pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the reported observations were made simultaneously at 635  mhz , 990  mhz and 1390  mhz , to allow continuous measurement of the dispersion measure ( dm ) .",
    "dual channel receivers with an equivalent system temperature of 60 k are used at each frequency , except for 1390  mhz , where only the right handed circular polarisation is observed .",
    "receiver bandwidths of 250 khz at 635  mhz , 800  khz at 990  mhz and 2  mhz at 1390  mhz limit the pulse broadening from interstellar dispersion to less than 1% of the pulse period .",
    "the detected output from each receiver was folded for 2 minutes to give integrated pulse profiles from 1,344 pulses .",
    "the profiles were subsequently combined to give profiles of total intensity .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in each total intensity profile is typically 30:1 , allowing a mean pulse arrival time to be determined to an accuracy of @xmath2s at 635  mhz , @xmath3s at 990  mhz and @xmath4s at 1390  mhz per integration .",
    "the recent improvements in the time resolution have been achieved by incoherently de - dispersing over 8 adjacent channels at 990  mhz , thereby increasing the signal to noise ratio and allowing observations of single pulses .",
    "the de - dispersed bandpass is sampled at 2 khz and recorded directly onto disk for later retrieval , while an ` on the fly ' monitoring system folds on a ten second basis for which the rms is @xmath5s .",
    "these arrival times are monitored and if a glitch is detected a warning is issued and the single pulse data are retained .",
    "the full , folded , timing profiles are stored in epn format @xcite , cross correlated with high signal to noise profile templates , then fitted to find the time of arrival ( toa ) of the pulse .",
    "a taylor expansion is parameterised in terms of the spin - down model phase ( @xmath6 ) around a selected epoch ( @xmath7 relative to @xmath8 ) with frequency @xmath9 , and frequency derivative @xmath10 , and has the form ;    @xmath11    the post glitch frequency change can be written as the sum of the pre - glitch frequency plus the permanent change at the time of the glitch , plus other decay terms :    @xmath12    however , it should be noted that some investigators set the permanent change terms , @xmath13 and @xmath14 to zero .",
    "we have allowed @xmath13 to take non - zero values , but keep @xmath14 as zero .",
    "both of these terms affect only the longest time - scales , where both timing noise and the occurrence of the subsequent glitches make definitive separation impossible .",
    "the data presented here were recorded between mjd 51505 and 51650 .",
    "the arrival time data have been transformed to the solar system barycentre using standard techniques .",
    "the position and proper motion of the vela pulsar was defined by data from the radio vlbi position of @xcite .",
    "the recorded toas from all frequencies and both systems were fitted in the program * tempo*. the results of this fit are given in table 1 .",
    "figure 1a shows the residuals from the pre - jump fit for data taken on 2000 january 16 ( mjd 51559 ) with the full polarisation system . shortly after 07:34 ut , the residuals diverge from the fit , indicating a sudden decrease in pulse period .",
    "figure 1b shows an hour of data starting at mjd 51559.3 .",
    "individual data points represent ten second averages constructed from the single pulse data .",
    "the period jump occurs on a very short timescale , without warning .",
    "the observations are consistent with an instantaneous change in period ; modeling has shown that a spin - up timescale of forty seconds would produce a three sigma signal .",
    "the separation into four time - scales is clear .",
    "the longer three decay terms are similar to those previously reported @xcite , and are in an approximately equal ratio of 5.9:5.7 .",
    "these have been associated with the vortex creep models by @xcite and others .",
    "the fast decay timescale , not previously observed ( or observable ) is shown separated from the other effects in figure 2 .",
    "we have subtracted the terms found by * tempo * in the 2 minute data from the single pulse data folded for 10 seconds . in this plot a gradual spin - up ( as opposed to instantaneous ) would be a negative excursion around the projected time of the glitch , as we d have overestimated the phase in the model .",
    "we see a positive excursion , followed by a rapid decay .",
    "a positive excursion could be produced by the pulsar slowing down just before the glitch or , more likely , if the estimate of the glitch epoch was too early because there was an extra component not resolvable in the 2 minute data .",
    "once the original fit was removed this would give a linear rise with the gradient @xmath15 found in the 2 minutes data , followed by a decay .",
    "we have fitted this rise ( @xmath16 ) followed by a forth exponential decay term to give the true glitch epoch and the fastest decay term .",
    "since the acceleration of the crust can not be instantaneous , it should be possible to observe the spin - up of the rotation period of the pulsar .",
    "the parallel single pulse system designed to observe this has a three @xmath17 detection limit of less than 40 seconds .",
    "this is in contrast to the observations made on the crab @xcite , where the spin - up timescale has been observed to take about half a day .",
    "no variation could be seen either before or after the glitch in profile shape , magnitude , or polarisation in the radio observations on any time - scale .",
    "the raw time series using both long and short timescales has been closely examined to look for other periodic and quasi - periodic signals , but no extra terms were found .",
    "we will use our data to explore one model of pulsar glitches in which the glitches are a consequence of pinning of superfluid vortices to the stellar crust . as the neutron star slows due the external drag on the crust",
    ", an angular momentum excess develops in the pinned superfluid .",
    "ultimately the vortices unpin catastrophically , transferring the excess momentum to the crust , producing a glitch .",
    "our high time resolution studies permit constraints on the manner in which the liquid interior imparts its angular momentum to the crust .",
    "this coupling is thought to be due to dissipative motion of vortices through the crustal lattice after unpinning .",
    "various papers have tackled calculation of the drag on vortex lines within the superfluid ( e.g. @xcite ) produced by vortex - neutron scattering in the crust .",
    "we will ignore the details of the interaction here , as it is not a simple process .",
    "however , given that we have a lower limit for the spin - up time , we can obtain an observational limit for the force per length , @xmath18 , that a vortex line exerts on the superfluid during this spin - up phase in vela . assuming that pinned vorticity in the crust is responsible for the glitch , it is straightforward to calculate the torque required to spin - up the pulsar , and then , by assuming canonical neutron star radii , crust depths and vortice lengths , give the force per unit length .    during the spin - up ,",
    "the torque on the crust , @xmath19 , is :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the moment of inertia of the portion of the superfluid that drives the glitch and @xmath22 is the change in angular velocity of that component , @xmath23 is the spin - up time .",
    "since angular momentum is conserved in the glitch , the torque is    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the moment of inertia of the solid crust plus any component that is coupled to it over a timescale in less than the spin - up time @xmath23 , and @xmath26 is the observed spin - up of the crust over @xmath23 .    in magnitude , the torque is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the azimuthal component of the force that vortices exert on the lattice during the glitch , and @xmath29 is the average distance of vortices from the rotation axis , approximately the stellar radius .",
    "the azimuthal force is    @xmath30    where @xmath18 is the force exerted per unit length per vortex , @xmath31 is the average length of a vortex , and @xmath32 is the total number of vortices that are participating in the spin - up .",
    "the number of vortices is    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the number of vortices per unit area and @xmath35 is the thickness of the pinning region ( approximately the thickness of the crust ) .",
    "the number density of vortices in a rotating superfluid is    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the superfluid rotational velocity , approximately equal to the rotational velocity of the crust and @xmath38 is the quantum of circulation of a neutron fluid ( 0.0019 @xmath39/s ) .",
    "putting these expressions together gives a constraint for @xmath18 :    @xmath40    @xmath35 , the thickness of the crust , is about 0.1 km .",
    "we take @xmath31 , the length of a vortex , to be roughly @xmath35 .",
    "we defined @xmath25 as the moment of inertia of the solid plus any other component coupled to it in a timescale less than @xmath23 . if the core fluid",
    "is tightly coupled to the solid crust over @xmath23 , then @xmath25 is approximately the moment of inertia of the entire star ( about @xmath41 g  @xmath39 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the core is decoupled over @xmath23 then @xmath25 would correspond to the moment of inertia of the solid crust only , which is about @xmath42 g  @xmath39 for a moderate equation of state .",
    "so we can obtain a lower limit on @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath43    where @xmath44 is the crust inertia in units of @xmath42 g  @xmath39 .",
    "vortices could pin to the lattice with a force @xmath45 times this @xcite , but our observations constrain the value of @xmath18 during the dissipative regime , whilst the pulsar is being spun up . putting the same parameters into the crab time - resolved glitch of mjd 50259.93 @xcite we find that in that case @xmath46  dyn / cm .",
    "this is further evidence , if more was needed , that the crab pulsar is a very different object from the vela pulsar .",
    "the major difference between the crab and the vela pulsars is the age , and therefore the temperature .",
    "@xcite found a strong temperature dependence for some scattering processes , and these differences may be key to our understanding of the momentum transfer in glitches .",
    "further spin - up observations for both the crab and vela are required .",
    "further improvements of the single pulse system are being undertaken , with a new coherent dedispersion system , which will allow a detection limit of a few seconds , the order of the fastest coupling times in all theoretical models .",
    "this should also allow us to measure @xmath18 , the force per unit length on the vortices , and confirm the fast decay term . higher time resolution will allow further constraints on the coupling of the crust to the liquid interior , including the core . we will also co - ordinate with chandra to reduce the too delay time in order to determine whether a very short lived thermal pulse might be emitted ."
