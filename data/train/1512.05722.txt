    "cepheids and rr  lyrae stars have always played an invaluable role in mapping the universe and tracing the kinematical and physical properties of various stellar populations . with the advance of the gaia mission , in a few years time we will be able to fix the zero points of the period - luminosity - color or period - near infrared magnitude relations with an error lower than @xmath0  mag @xcite and thereby measure distances in the nearby universe with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "although the physics behind the basic properties ( such as their self - excitation mechanism ) of these vital objects are well known for more than half of a century , there is a nearly complete lack of understanding two , well - populated subgroups of these variables .",
    "these subgroups are those of the double - mode pulsators ( both among cepheids and rr  lyrae stars ) and the blazhko variables ( characteristically among rr  lyrae stars ) . although the modes occurring in the ` classical ' double - mode variables are well - identified with the low - order modes from the linear theory@xmath1 is a mystery ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "] , the clear cause of the sustained double - mode state is still unknown and nonlinear modeling is controversial ( see @xcite vs. @xcite ) .",
    "the situation with the blazhko stars ( rr  lyrae variables showing periodic amplitude and phase modulations ) is even worse . as of this writing , _ we do not have a clue _ why many rr  lyrae stars vary their amplitudes that leads in some cases nearly ceasing pulsation in the low - amplitude states .",
    "this is not just a minute wrinkle spoiling the classical and simple picture on these old stars . on the opposite , with no physically justified and testable idea / model we miss some basic ingredient not just in the pulsation models but most likely in the evolutionary models , too .",
    "no detailed accounts are to be given in this summary on the observational properties and failed modeling of these objects . on these",
    "we refer to the review by @xcite from the pre - kepler era and those by @xcite and @xcite more recently , already incorporating the results of the kepler mission .",
    "we list some obvious ( but strenuous ) avenues for future works , including detailed spectroscopic studies and higher dimension hydrodynamical surveys of rr  lyrae models .",
    "unconventionally , we present some new results concerning the simple consequences of the observed distributions of modulation amplitudes .",
    "here we focus on the fundamental mode ( rrab ) variables , since their considerably larger number and higher amplitudes yield statistically more reliable samples than those available for the first overtone stars .",
    "the basic rates and related data are summarized in table  [ bl_stat ] .",

    "+ @xmath3 see @xcite for a slightly lower incidence rate .",
    "+ @xmath4 no details are given .",
    "+ @xmath5 strange low incidence rate in spite of the high - quality data selection .",
    "[ bl_stat ]    what is clear from this table is that blazhko ( bl ) stars are numerous in various stellar populations and the actual figures suggest internal differences among them ( e.g. , lmc vs. galactic field ) .",
    "it is interesting that traditional ground - based surveys yield rates close to the ones derived by the orders of magnitude more accurate space missions",
    ".  cm telescope , whereas wide - field transit / variability surveys operate @xmath6@xmath7  cm - class telescopes .",
    "] this suggests that _ the relative number of bl stars with low modulation amplitudes is small_. indeed , from the @xmath8 bl stars of the _ kepler _ sample discussed by @xcite only two show modulation amplitudes lower than @xmath0  mag .",
    "this is a remarkable property , indicating the existence of some lower floor of the amplitude modulation and suggesting that reliable statistics can be derived also from the today s ground - based surveys capable of hitting the detection limit for sinusoidal signals with amplitudes of @xmath9@xmath0  mag .",
    "we see from table  [ bl_stat ] that the incidence rates in both magellanic clouds are systematically lower that those derived in the galactic bulge and , especially , in the galactic field ( gf ) .",
    "there is also a significant difference between the macho and ogle rates .",
    "since both rates are based on fairly large samples , we suspect that the difference is due to the higher accuracy of the ogle data as they evolved over the years after the macho project was abandoned . in the following we correct the macho statistics for the lower detection rates and examine if it leads to an agreement with the ogle rates .",
    "first we compute the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the maximum fourier side lobes available from the published data ( @xcite [ lmc ] ; @xcite [ m3 ] and @xcite [ gf ] ) . recall that cdf denotes the probability that the modulation amplitude is smaller than a given value , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "figure  1 shows the resulting cdfs , clearly indicating a want of the low - amplitude bl stars in the lmc sample . with similar observational noise ,",
    "the bl stars in m3 and in the gf seem to follow the same distribution ( we do not deal with the small differences at this stage ) .",
    "[ cdf_obs ]    we test the hypothesis that bl stars both in the lmc and in the gf follow the same intrinsic cdf and the difference is entirely attributed to the lower detection efficiency on the noisier macho data . in a simple approach",
    "the test can be performed by injecting sinusoidal signals in the time series consisting the gaussian noise , generated according to the standard deviations of the residuals ( particular to each star ) in the single mode rr  lyrae sample . instead of generating and then analyzing these time series",
    ", we estimate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a sinusoidal component with amplitude @xmath11 , data point number @xmath12 and noise standard deviation",
    "@xmath13 @xmath14 we tested the applicability of this formula by comparing the above parameter with the s / n of the frequency spectra .",
    "we found good correlation , and set the lower limit of snr to @xmath15 to fix the detection rate equal to the one obtained directly from the frequency spectra .",
    "[ field2lmc ]    after generating amplitudes following the cdf of the gf bl stars , many realizations are tested by using the standard deviations of the residuals in some @xmath16 monoperiodic stars from the macho lmc sample .",
    "each star is checked for the detection criterion @xmath17 and flagged as ` detected ' or ` not detected ' accordingly .",
    "since the amplitudes are known , we are able to construct the cdf for the detected cases . the result is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we see that using the noise properties of the macho data on the cdf of the gf bl stars , the resulting cdf becomes very similar to the observed cdf of the lmc .",
    "this suggests that _ the distribution of the modulation amplitudes is likely the same in the two populations_.    [ lmc_rat ]    the true incidence rate for the lmc can be calculated from the unnormalized version of the cdf based on the amplitude distribution of the gf ( black dots in fig .  2 ) .",
    "this cumulative detection rate ( see fig .  3 ) yields a factor of @xmath18 for the total detection rate .",
    "this , with the observed rate of @xmath19% of @xcite results in an unbiased incidence rate of @xmath20% . considering the values listed in table  [ bl_stat ] , we see a better ( though not perfect ) agreement with the values obtained from the more accurate ogle data for both clouds .",
    "this test supports the idea that _ the lower incidence rate in the magellanic clouds is real and that there is a likely population dependence of the occurrence of bl stars_.      with the recent sample of the gf bl stars by @xcite and the already existing large amount of data on the magellanic clouds , we are in a position to test a simple bl model involving the @xmath21 nonradial components .",
    "we recall that in the basic model of the bl effect this nonradial mode is the one that is most viable for a @xmath22 resonant interaction with the fundamental radial mode ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the coupling gives rise to a steady ( constant amplitude ) triple - mode pulsation with the @xmath23 radial fundamental , and the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 nonradial modes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the interaction leads to a phase - locked , that is single - period pulsation .",
    "the amplitude modulation is due to the changing sky - projected area with the nonradial component of the rotating star .",
    "although in this simple form this model is unable to explain asymmetric modulation side lobes , it is still interesting how the observed distribution of the modulation amplitudes look like if the above mode pattern played some role in the bl phenomenon .    following @xcite ,",
    "the observed luminosity variation of a nonradially pulsating star can be written in the following form ( the abbreviated form of his eq .",
    "6 ) @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the surface amplitude , frequency and phase of the nonradial mode .",
    "the factor @xmath31 is the associated legendre polynomial , depending on the mode order , degree and the inclination angle @xmath32 ( @xmath33 if the rotational axis is perpendicular to the line of sight ) . in the simple case of the @xmath21 mode ,",
    "this factor is just a sine function .",
    "below we examine the effect of this factor on the observed distribution of the amplitude modulation , assuming different priors for the distributions of the underlying nonradial mode amplitudes and a uniform prior for inclination angle .",
    "[ orp_test1 ]    first we assume that all bl stars have the same modulation amplitude and the observed amplitude is merely affected by the aspect angle .",
    "this , admittedly not too likely scenario leads to the theoretical cdf shown in fig .",
    "it is comforting that we can clearly exclude the extreme mechanism that might lead to such a particular amplitude distribution .",
    "next , we consider the physically more likely setting , when all amplitudes in @xmath34 $ ] occur with the same probability ( here @xmath35 is the maximum possible modulation amplitude  which , as noted earlier , we take as the maximum sidelobe in the fourier spectra ) . as shown in fig .  5 ,",
    "this is a better - fitting model but still shows characteristic deviations by under / over - estimating the observed distribution at high / low modulation amplitudes .",
    "finally , we assume that low / high modulation amplitudes are intrinsically of low probability .",
    "this situation is modeled by a gaussian distribution peaked at @xmath36 .",
    "we see on the right panel of fig .  5 that this assumption yields a considerably better fit , although the high - amplitude part of the distribution is now overestimated .",
    "from these results we conclude that even if the bl phenomenon is affected by an aspect - dependence , there should exist some mechanism that prefers mid - size modulations and makes low / high modulations much less likely .",
    "[ orp_test2 ]",
    "there are many intriguing properties of the bl stars and it is obviously impossible to list them all here .",
    "what might perhaps still be useful is to focus on the more general , robust properties , that are inescapable to deal with in any future modeling .",
    "we list these properties in table  [ bl_prop ] with some sort of ranking based on a mixture of the size and/or the commonality of the given property .",
    "we do not know which feature will finally unveil the secret of the bl phenomenon but at this stage our preference goes to those ideas / models that offer some solution to reproduce the first three / four properties .",

    "+ @xmath40 by the loose term ` strongly asymmetric ' we mean those cases when one of the side lobes is close to the noise level .",

    "see @xcite ) . at lower noise level",
    "they may exhibit both side lobes but they remain quite different . + @xmath43 the phenomenon is commonly called in the rr  lyrae community as ` period doubling ' .",
    "we think that unless it can be clearly related to the first step on the route of bifurcation to chaos , it is more appropriate to call ` amplitude alternation ' , since the expression ` period doubling ' is specifically attached to the process mentioned @xcite .",
    "we also note the systematic frequency displacements at the positions of the expected half integer resonances in some well - studied cases @xcite are also atypical of period doubling .",
    "[ bl_prop ]    for the currently available models / ideas , here is a brief summary of the main reasons of their failure in their present forms .",
    "@xmath45 _ magnetic oblique rotator / pulsator : _ @xcite : symmetric sidelobes only , lack of strong magnetic field .",
    "@xmath45 _ nonresonant radial / nonradial double - mode pulsator : _ @xcite : questions about the strength of the excitation of the nonradial mode and about the reasons why the close radial and nonradial modes are not phase - locked , leading to monoperiodic pulsation .",
    "@xmath45 _ resonant nonradial rotator / pulsator : _ @xcite : symmetric sidelobes only , questions concerning the current forms of amplitude equations in the case of nonradial modes in rr  lyrae models @xcite .    @xmath45 _ radial mode resonance of 9:2 : _ @xcite : lack of modulation in the rr  lyrae nonlinear hydrodynamical models .",
    "@xmath45 _ magnetic dinamo - driven convection : _ @xcite : lack of mathematical / physical rigor and any modeling .",
    "@xmath45 _ periodic energy dissipation driven by shock wave dynamics : _",
    "@xcite : the idea is based on the analysis of standard 1d hydrodynamical models showing no amplitude modulation , therefore it is unclear what kind of mechanism could be deciphered from these models that might be relevant for future modeling .",
    "because of the lack of any , physically sound idea , it is hard to point toward any direction in which progress can be made .",
    "nevertheless , we can mention two areas that are still not investigated with the depth required for getting useful information for model building . from the side of the observations",
    ", it would be vital to find out if there is any nonradial component .",
    "if yes , then does its size correlate with the amplitude of the blazhko effect ?",
    "it is a hard observational project ( faint objects , long - term data acquisition , need for high - dispersion spectroscopy , difficulties in disentangling the nonradial component in the presence of the large radial , time - dependent component , etc . ) . from the side of modeling  again , due to the lack of any better guidance ",
    "one may try to conduct some expensive survey of the already existing 2d/3d hydrodynamical models ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , and investigate the effect of better modeled convection or that of the rotation .",
    "of course , due to the well - known attribute of serendipity of scientific discoveries , it might well be that we find something completely unexpected in the course of other studies that will finally lead to the long - waited understanding of this exceptional hydrodynamical phenomenon .",
    "my life - long appreciation and gratitude go out to my mentor and long - time friend wojtek who introduced me into the exciting field of nonlinear stellar pulsations and gave me his support and encouragement over the years .",
