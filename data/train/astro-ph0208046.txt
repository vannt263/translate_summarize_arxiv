    "mhd turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysics . for example , it is present in the sun , the solar wind , the interstellar medium , molecular clouds , accretion disks , and galaxy clusters .",
    "theoretical understanding of incompressible mhd turbulence has grown explosively in the last decade .",
    "nonetheless , it remains underdeveloped .",
    "iroshnikov ( 1963 ) and kraichnan ( 1965 ) developed a theory for mhd turbulence .",
    "they realized that the magnetic field at the largest lengthscale in a cascade directly affects all of the smaller lengthscales .",
    "small - scale fluctuations can be treated as small - amplitude waves in the presence of a large mean magnetic field . by contrast , the large - scale velocity is unimportant for small - scale dynamics ; it can be eliminated by a change of variables , since the equations of mhd are invariant under galilean transformations .. ]    despite their realization of the importance of the mean magnetic field , iroshnikov and kraichnan assumed that small - scale fluctuations are isotropic .",
    "numerical simulations later showed that this assumption is wrong .",
    "even with isotropic excitation at large scales , fluctuations on smaller scales are elongated along the mean magnetic field ( e.g. , montgomery & turner 1981 , shebalin , matthaeus , & montgomery 1983 ) .",
    "in retrospect , it is not very surprising to find elongated fluctuations .",
    "arbitrary disturbances in incompressible mhd can be decomposed into shear - alfvn and pseudo - alfvn waves .",
    "each wave travels either up or down the mean field at the alfvn speed , @xmath0 , which is the magnitude of the mean field in velocity units .",
    "consider stirring a magneto - fluid with a spoon that is moving at speed @xmath1 , for a time comparable to the spoon s width divided by @xmath2 . on small scales , since @xmath2 decreases towards small scales , whereas @xmath0 is unchanged .",
    "] alfvn waves are radiated away from the spoon , parallel to the mean field with speed @xmath3 .",
    "after the disturbance is finished , there are two wavepackets travelling away from each other .",
    "each wavepacket is elongated along the mean field , with parallel - to - transverse aspect ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the characteristics of mhd turbulence depend critically on the amount of elongation .",
    "when parallel - to - transverse aspect ratios are smaller than @xmath5 , waves collide many times before cascading .",
    "hence the turbulence is `` weak , '' and perturbation theory can be used to derive a kinetic equation and a spectrum ( sridhar & goldreich 1994 ; see zakharov , lvov , & falkovich 1992 for a general review of weak turbulence ) .",
    "goldreich & sridhar ( 1997 ) and ng & bhattacharjee ( 1997 ) deduced the spectrum of the balanced weak cascade from scaling arguments .",
    "however , similar scaling arguments are inadequate for the imbalanced cascade ( see  [ sec : insufficiency ] of the present paper ) .",
    "galtier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived the kinetic equation for the weak imbalanced cascade .",
    "their balanced spectrum agrees with that of goldreich & sridhar ( 1997 ) and ng & bhattacharjee ( 1997 ) .",
    "they also presented a partial solution for the general imbalanced case . in ",
    "[ sec : insufficiency ] , we explain why their solution is incomplete ; in  [ sec : sses ] we give the complete solution .",
    "even if aspect ratios are smaller than @xmath5 on large scales , at a small enough scale they become comparable to @xmath5 . below",
    "this scale perturbation theory breaks down , and weak turbulence becomes `` strong . ''",
    "goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) worked out the scalings for the balanced strong cascade .",
    "they argued that aspect ratios are comparable to @xmath5 at all scales in the strong regime .",
    "strong turbulence is difficult , largely because it is non - perturbative .",
    "although strong and weak turbulence differ in a number of ways , they also share many similarities .",
    "one of our motivations for studying weak turbulence is to gain insight into strong turbulence .",
    "in particular , turbulence in the solar wind is observed to be imbalanced ; it can not be understood without a theory for imbalanced strong mhd turbulence . yet",
    "this theory is unknown . in a future paper",
    ", we will work it out by extending the results of the present paper .",
    "ideal incompressible mhd is described by the following equations of motion : @xmath6 the density is set to unity ; the fluid velocity is @xmath7 ; the magnetic field in velocity units is @xmath8(magnetic field)@xmath9 ; the total pressure is @xmath10 , which is the sum of the thermal and magnetic pressures .",
    "viscous and resistive terms are neglected in the above equations ; they are important on small scales , and will be included where required .",
    "we decompose the magnetic field into its mean , @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is the alfvn speed and @xmath12 is a unit vector , and into its fluctuating part @xmath13 . with this decomposition , the equations of motion may be written in terms of the elsasser variables , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as follows : @xmath16 note that @xmath17 is not an independent degree of freedom . taking the divergence of either equation ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) or ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) yields @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inverse laplacian . when @xmath20 , @xmath21 propagates undistorted upwards along the mean magnetic field with speed @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath22 , @xmath23 propagates downwards at @xmath0 .",
    "nonlinear interactions occur only between oppositely directed wavepackets .",
    "it is these interactions that are responsible for turbulence .",
    "there are three conserved quantities in incompressible mhd .",
    "two of these are immediately apparent from equations ( [ eq : eom1])-([eq : eom3 ] ) : the energies of the upgoing and of the downgoing waves , i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "technically , these are twice the energy per unit mass .",
    "we refer to them as simply energies throughout the paper .",
    "these energies are directly related to the total ( kinetic plus magnetic ) energy @xmath26 and to the cross - helicity @xmath27 .",
    "the focus of this paper is turbulence where the energies in the up and down waves differ , or , equivalently , where the cross - helicity is non - zero .",
    "the third conserved quantity is magnetic helicity ; however , we consider only non - helical turbulence in this paper , so helicity does not play a role .    in mhd turbulence , on lengthscales much smaller than the outer scale ,",
    "there is effectively a strong mean magnetic field that is due to fluctuations on the largest lengthscales .",
    "gradients transverse to this mean field are much larger than gradients along it ( e.g. , shebalin , matthaeus , & montgomery 1983 , goldreich & sridhar 1995 , 1997 , ng & bhattacharjee 1996 ) .",
    "this allows the mhd equations to be slightly simplified . denoting transverse components with the symbol @xmath28 ,",
    "the transverse components of equation ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) are @xmath29 assuming that @xmath30 is much smaller than @xmath31 , and equation ( [ eq : eom3 ] ) is @xmath32 we assume that the parallel components of @xmath21 and @xmath23 are either comparable to , or less than , their respective perpendicular components .",
    "we will see below that this is typically the case in the inertial range of a turbulent cascade .",
    "similarly , @xmath33",
    "@xmath34    if we change @xmath35 to @xmath36 , equations ( [ eq : eomrmhd1])-([eq : eomrmhd4 ] ) form a closed set",
    ". they are called the equations of reduced mhd .",
    "they apply also in compressible mhd whenever transverse gradients are larger than parallel ones ( e.g. , biskamp 1993 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to solve these equations .",
    "although the complete equations are not much more complicated , it simplifies our discussions to neglect parallel gradients relative to perpendicular ones at the outset .",
    "there are two conserved energies in reduced mhd : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the parallel components of equations ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) are @xmath39 after neglecting parallel gradients relative to transverse ones , and after assuming that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are not much smaller than @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are conserved quantities .",
    "the transverse equations describing reduced mhd are unaffected by these parallel equations because the former are independent of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "nonetheless , the parallel equations have observable consequences .",
    "it is conventional to decompose the normal modes of linearized incompressible mhd , @xmath48 and @xmath23 , into shear - alfven and pseudo - alfvn waves .",
    "these correspond to the alfvn and slow waves of compressible mhd .",
    "when perpendicular gradients are much larger than parallel ones , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are nearly equivalent to shear - alfvn waves ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 are nearly equivalent to pseudo - alfvn waves .    also observationally relevant",
    "is the evolution of a passive scalar @xmath51 , which satisfies @xmath52 . in terms of elsasser variables , and after neglecting parallel gradients , the passive scalar satisfies @xmath53    to avoid a proliferation of subscripts , in the remainder of this paper we drop the @xmath54 from @xmath49 and @xmath50 . to denote the parallel components",
    ", we use @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "one of the virtues of weak mhd turbulence is that it can be analyzed in a mathematically rigorous way with perturbation theory ; this yields a kinetic equation .",
    "nevertheless , we begin with a qualitative description , which captures most of the features of the turbulent cascade .",
    "mhd turbulence can be understood from the dynamics of @xmath48 and @xmath23 ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : eomrmhd1]-[eq : eomrmhd4 ] ] for reduced mhd , dropping @xmath54 subscripts ) . to linear order",
    ", @xmath48 is a wave that propagates up the mean magnetic fieldlines at the alfvn speed , @xmath0 ; @xmath23 propagates down at @xmath0 .",
    "each wave perturbs the mean magnetic fieldlines .",
    "nonlinear terms describe the interaction between oppositely directed waves : each wave nearly follows the fieldlines perturbed by its collision partner .",
    "that travels upwards at speed @xmath0 , while following the magnetic fieldlines of the down - going @xmath23 is @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eomrmhd1 ] ) for the vector @xmath48 differs from this because of the pressure term , which is required to keep @xmath48 incompressible , while conserving the energy @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath48 does not exactly follow the fieldlines of @xmath23 .",
    "nonetheless , this deviation does not greatly affect the behaviour of the turbulence .",
    "dissipation is a second effect that prevents the following of fieldlines . in the present discussion",
    ", we consider lengthscales that are sufficiently large that dissipation can be neglected . ]",
    "consider an upgoing wavepacket that encounters a train of downgoing wavepackets . as",
    "the upgoing wave travels up the length of the downgoing train , it is gradually distorted .",
    "it tries to follow the perturbed fieldlines in the downgoing train , but these fieldlines `` wander , '' i.e. , the transverse separation between any two fieldlines changes .",
    "when the up - wave has travelled through a sufficiently large number of downgoing wavepackets that the amount of fieldline wander is comparable to the up - wave s transverse size , then the up - wave cascades .    to be quantitative , let each downgoing wave in the train have a typical amplitude @xmath57 , a transverse size @xmath58 , and a parallel size @xmath59 , where `` transverse '' and `` parallel '' refer to the orientation relative to the mean magnetic field .",
    "the most important collisions are between wavepackets of comparable transverse size ( see  [ sec : locality ] ) .",
    "so let the upgoing wave have transverse size @xmath58 as well .",
    "since each downgoing wavepacket has a typical perturbed magnetic field of magnitude @xmath60 ( neglecting the factor of @xmath61 ) , it bends the fieldlines by the angle @xmath62 ; the transverse displacement of a fieldline through this wavepacket is @xmath63 ; and the wander of two typical fieldlines through the wavepacket , if they are initially separated by @xmath58 , is also @xmath63 .    in weak turbulence ,",
    "the wander through a single wavepacket is smaller than the wavepacket s transverse size , @xmath64 when these inequalities are not satisfied , strong turbulence is applicable ; see  [ sec : strong ] .",
    "thus in weak turbulence an upgoing wavepacket must travel through many downgoing ones before cascading .",
    "after @xmath65 downgoing wavepackets , fieldlines have wandered a distance @xmath66 , assuming that wavepackets are statistically independent . the upgoing wavepacket is fully distorted  and hence cascaded  when the fieldlines it is following wander a distance @xmath58 , i.e. , when @xmath67 . since each downgoing wavepacket",
    "is crossed in the time @xmath68 , the cascade time of the upgoing wavepacket is @xmath69 in this time , the upgoing wavepacket travels a distance @xmath70 , which is much larger than its own length , @xmath59 . ; the extension to the case when they differ is trivial , as long as the inequalities ( [ eq : inter ] ) are both satisfied , with the appropriate @xmath59 s . ]",
    "the head and the tail of the upgoing wavepacket are both distorted by the same downgoing wavepackets ; so both head and tail undergo nearly the same distortion as they cascade .. ] consequently , as the upgoing wavepacket cascades to smaller transverse lengthscales , it does not cascade to smaller parallel ones : @xmath71 a proof of this follows from the 3-wave resonance relations ( shebalin , matthaeus , & montgomery 1983 ; see also  [ sec : compare ] of the present paper ) .",
    "we calculate the steady state energy spectra by using kolmogorov s picture of energy flowing from large to small lengthscales .",
    "the energy in up - waves flows from lengthscales larger than @xmath58 to those smaller than @xmath58 at the rate @xmath72 ^ 2\\frac{{{\\lambda } } } { v_a } \\label{eq : epsilonheuristic }   \\ .\\ ] ] we call this simply the `` flux . ''",
    "we define @xmath73 more precisely below ( eq . [ [ eq : flux ] ] ) . in steady state",

    "however , if the cascade is imbalanced , a number of complications arise .    by the symmetry between up- and down - going waves ,",
    "the down - going flux is given by the analogue of equation ( [ eq : epsilonheuristic ] ) : @xmath78 ^ 2\\frac{{{\\lambda } } } { v_a } \\ .",

    "had this degeneracy not occurred , e.g. , had we found @xmath81 where @xmath82 , then the solution would have been simple : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which follow from the constancy of @xmath73 and @xmath79 with @xmath58 .",
    "but in weak mhd turbulence @xmath85 ( eqs . [ [ eq : epsilonheuristic ] ] and [ [ eq : epsilondownheuristic ] ] ) ; constancy of @xmath79 with @xmath58 is forced by the constancy of @xmath73 , and does not yield new information .",
    "one implication is that scaling arguments are insufficient to determine the flux ratio @xmath86 .",
    "physically , any flux ratio should be possible .",
    "but without the dimensionless coefficients of equations ( [ eq : epsilonheuristic ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilondownheuristic ] ) , @xmath86 can not be determined .",
    "the coefficients can not be obtained from scaling arguments ; they depend on the spectral slopes of @xmath80 and @xmath57 ( which are related through @xmath87 , eq . [ [ eq : intscal2 ] ] ) .",

    "( 2000 ) calculated the coefficients using kinetic equations .",
    "we explain how in  [ sec : steadystatefluxes ] . therefore these authors were able to relate the flux ratio to the spectral slopes .",
    "the arguments presented thus far are still insufficiently constraining .",
    "equations ( [ eq : epsilonheuristic ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilondownheuristic ] ) constrain only the product @xmath88 .",
    "there are seemingly an infinite number of solutions with given values of @xmath73 and @xmath79 , since @xmath80 can be multiplied by any constant as long as @xmath57 is divided by this same constant .",
    "furthermore , we expect on physical grounds that if the values of @xmath80 and @xmath57 at a given lengthscale are fixed ( instead of the values of @xmath73 and @xmath79 ) , the cascade should be completely constrained ; however , in this case the constancy of equations ( [ eq : epsilonheuristic ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilondownheuristic ] ) leaves the @xmath89-dependence of @xmath90 completely undetermined  even given the coefficients derived by galtier et al .",
    "do @xmath80 and @xmath57 cross ? are they cut off by dissipation at the same scale ?",
    "all of these problems for the imbalanced cascade can be resolved once the dynamics at the dissipation scale is understood .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that the energies of the up- and down - going waves are forced to equalize  they are `` pinned''at the dissipation scale .",
    "this completely constrains the cascade .",
    "it is unusual that the dynamics at the dissipation scale has such an important influence . in this subsection",
    "we explain why pinning occurs . in  [ sec : sses ] , we give the resulting solution of the steady state cascade .    from equation ( [ eq : cascadetime ] ) , the cascade time of the up - going waves is inversely proportional to the energy of the down - going ones : @xmath91 , and similarly for the downgoing waves .",
    "we consider how the spectra evolve if initially , on lengthscales comparable to the dissipation scale , waves going in one direction are more energetic than the oppositely directed ones .",

    ", @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is both the viscosity and the resistivity . ] on large lengthscales , the dissipation timescale is much longer than the cascade times ; @xmath97 decreases faster with increasing @xmath100 than both @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the effects of dissipation are felt on lengthscales where @xmath97 is comparable to  or smaller than  either @xmath101 or @xmath102 . since @xmath96 in the vicinity of the dissipation scale ,",
    "the largest lengthscale at which dissipation effects are felt is where @xmath103 . in figure",

    "[ fig : ke1]b - c .",
    "we hold the energies at @xmath105 fixed ; this does not affect the short - time behaviour shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ke1]b - c .",
    "since @xmath80 feels the dissipative effects at @xmath104 , its spectrum is exponentially cut off at smaller scales .",
    "this implies that the cascade time of the down waves , @xmath102 , increases exponentially towards smaller scales . as a result ,",
    "down - wave energy that is being cascaded from large to small scales can not be cascaded fast enough at @xmath106 .",
    "therefore the down - waves energy flux is backed up , and the @xmath57 spectrum rises .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath57 rises , @xmath101 falls , so the cascade time of the up - waves on small scales decreases , and the up - wave spectrum falls .",
    "the final result is that the two spectra are pinned at the dissipation scale .",
    "this pinning occurs very quickly : on the dissipation timescale .",
    "in steady state , the energy spectra @xmath80 and @xmath57 are power laws that ( i ) are pinned at the dissipation scale , and ( ii ) satisfy @xmath107 ( eq . [ [ eq : intscal2 ] ] ) .",
    "these two conditions completely characterize the steady state spectra , as long as @xmath80 and @xmath57 are specified at the outer scale .",
    "it is a remarkable feature of weak mhd turbulence that the dynamics at the dissipation scale dramatically affects the entire cascade .",
    "normally , the energy in turbulent cascades is viewed as flowing unimpeded from larger scales to smaller scales .",
    "energy is injected at the outer scale and swallowed up at the dissipation scale .",
    "but in weak mhd turbulence , if initially the spectra are not pinned , then the spectrum with lower energy becomes backed up , and its energy increases until pinning occurs .",
    "a similar effect was found by grappin , pouquet , and lorat ( 1983 ) .",
    "these authors modelled imbalanced mhd turbulence with an edqnm closure approximation .",
    "however , they assumed that the turbulence is isotropic , which is incorrect . nonetheless , they found in their model that scaling arguments constrained only the sum of the slopes of the up- and down - going waves spectra , and that the two spectra are constrained to be equal at the dissipation scale .",
    "thus they discovered pinning , even though they analyzed an invalid model of mhd turbulence .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we derive the scalings in steady state .",

    "sec : scaling ] , it is assumed that the dominant interactions are those between wavepackets that have comparable transverse lengthscales , i.e. , interactions are `` local '' in lengthscale . in this section",
    ", we justify this assumption .",
    "we focus on the cascading of an upgoing wavepacket by downgoing ones .",
    "let the upgoing wavepacket have transverse size @xmath58 , and let the downgoing wavepackets each have transverse size @xmath143 , parallel size @xmath59 , and amplitude @xmath144 .",
    "the upgoing wavepacket cascades when the fieldlines it is following wander a distance comparable to its transverse size , @xmath58 .",
    "we consider first the case that @xmath145 .",
    "two fieldlines that are separated by @xmath58 at the head of the downgoing wavepackets wander independently of each other . their transverse separation after @xmath65 downgoing wavepackets increases by @xmath146    conversely ,",
    "if @xmath147 , then the magnetic field can be expanded to linear order in @xmath58 , so the magnetic field at two points separated by @xmath58 differs by @xmath148 .",
    "consequently , the fieldlines separate by @xmath149 so long as this separation is smaller than @xmath58 .    for interactions to be local ,",
    "i.e. , for the amount of fieldline wander seen by an up - wave of transverse size @xmath58 to be maximized by those down - waves that have @xmath150 , the following two conditions must hold : ( i ) @xmath144 is an increasing function of @xmath143 ( eq . [ [ eq : wander1 ] ] ) ; and ( ii ) @xmath151 is a decreasing function of @xmath143 ( eq . [ [ eq : wander2 ] ] ) .",
    "so the cascade is local if @xmath152 the same condition clearly holds for @xmath80 . in terms of the steady - state scalings , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the condition @xmath153 is required for the cascade to be local ; otherwise , nonlocal effects are important .",

    "there is a second reason why the condition @xmath154 is necessary for our heuristic arguments to be valid .",
    "consider a single fourier mode with wavelength @xmath143 and amplitude @xmath155 ; then the typical difference in @xmath156 between two points separated by @xmath157 is @xmath158 , expanding to linear order in @xmath58 .",
    "so , if the condition @xmath154 is violated , then the contribution to @xmath80 ( i.e. , to the typical difference in @xmath156 between two points separated by @xmath58 ) is dominated by those fourier modes that have wavelengths @xmath159 .",
    "this is a different kind of non - locality than considered previously : the upgoing energy that crosses lengthscale @xmath58 comes directly from much larger scales ( with @xmath160 ) .",
    "weak turbulence is applicable when @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( eq . [ [ eq : inter ] ] ) .",
    "since @xmath58 decreases faster than both @xmath57 and @xmath80 ( eq . [ [ eq : intercond ] ] ) , even if these inequalities are satisfied at large lengthscales , they are violated at small ones .",
    "thus weak turbulence has a limited inertial range",
    ".    strong turbulence , which is applicable when the above inequalities are violated , is of greater relevance than weak turbulence for describing astrophysical sites such as the solar wind . in strong turbulence",
    "the change in fieldline separation within a single wavepacket is not smaller than the transverse size of the wavepacket .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , equation ( [ eq : cascadetime ] ) for the cascade time is no longer valid ; and second , the parallel size of wavepackets @xmath59 decreases towards smaller scales because the head and tail of a wavepacket are independently cascaded .",
    "the balanced strong cascade is worked out by goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) ; we discuss the imbalanced strong cascade in a future paper .",
    "strong turbulence is more difficult to analyze than weak turbulence because it does not submit to perturbation theory .",
    "nonetheless , a number of the features of weak turbulence that we develop in the present paper are applicable to strong turbulence .",
    "this is one of our motivations for studying the weak cascade .",
    "since this paper is concerned with weak turbulence , we choose the dissipation scale to be sufficiently large that the entire cascade is weak , i.e. , we require that @xmath163 and similarly for @xmath164 .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : wdiss ] ) and ( [ eq : ldiss ] ) , we can re - write this condition as follows : @xmath165 there is also a lower limit on the product of the outer scale energies , set by the requirement that the dissipation scale be smaller than the outer scale , which implies that @xmath166 ( see eq . [ [ eq : ldiss ] ] ) .",
    "typically , one expects that @xmath167 , so as long as @xmath168 , the above two inequalities can be satisfied with appropriately chosen @xmath169 .      in  [ sec :",

    "] by contrast , the perpendicular components control the evolution of the parallel ones .",
    "the steady state spectra of the parallel components can be derived as follows . by analogy between the equation for @xmath170 ( eq . [ [ eq : parallel1 ] ] ) and",
    "that for @xmath48 ( eq . [ [ eq : eomrmhd1 ] ] ) , the cascade time of @xmath170 is similar to that of @xmath48 , i.e. , it is given by @xmath101 ( see eq . [ [ eq : cascadetime ] ] ) .",
    "we denote the typical amplitude of the parallel component of the up - wave on lengthscale @xmath89 by @xmath172 .",
    "the cascade rate of the energy of the parallel component is @xmath173 ; in steady state it must be independent of @xmath89 .",
    "comparing this to the cascade rate of the perpendicular component , @xmath174 , which must also be independent of @xmath89 , we deduce @xmath175 note that the evolution equation for @xmath170 ( eq . [ [ eq : parallel1 ] ] ) is linear .",
    "so the overall amplitude of the @xmath172 spectrum is arbitrary ; more accurately , it is set by the value of @xmath172 at the outer scale .",
    "of course , a similar relation holds for the down - waves : @xmath176    finally , we consider the spectrum of a passive scalar , @xmath51 , whose evolution is described by equation ( [ eq : scalar ] ) . from this equation , it is apparent that the cascade time of the passive scalar is given by either @xmath101 or @xmath102 , whichever is shorter .",
    "so , by the same reasoning that we used in deriving equation ( [ eq : parspec ] ) , we deduce @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the typical value of @xmath51 on lengthscale @xmath89 . because of the pinning of the spectra , the lesser of the two spectra @xmath80 and @xmath57 is also the flatter .",
    "so @xmath178 is proportional to the flatter of @xmath80 and @xmath57 .",
    "weak turbulence can be analyzed with perturbation theory . as a consequence , the evolution of the energy spectra of the up- and down - waves is described by a closed set of two equations ; in other words , the two - point correlation functions evolve independently of all higher - order correlation functions .",
    "this is a great simplification .",

    "the turbulence is isotropic in the transverse plane , so @xmath188 and @xmath189 are functions of the magnitude of @xmath186 .    from equation ( [ eq : kineticequationappendix ] ) in the appendix ,",

    "the steady - state relation between the energy and the flux that we use above ( eq . [ [ eq : epsf1 ] ] ) is obtained in the appendix by setting the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : kineticequation ] ) zero .    within an order - unity factor , @xmath197",

    "in this section we present the results of numerical simulations which verify our previous heuristic discussions : in particular , the pinning of spectra and the scaling of the spectra in steady state .",
    "it is much faster to simulate kinetic equations than the full equations of motion for @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this .",
    "first , the kinetic equations are only one dimensional , since homogeneity has been assumed parallel to the mean magnetic field , and isotropy has been assumed in the plane transverse to the mean magnetic field .",
    "second , and more importantly , the averaged energies @xmath188 and @xmath189 are much smoother functions of @xmath100 than @xmath21 and @xmath23 . thus , a logarithmically - spaced grid can be used , which greatly reduces the number of variables that need to be evolved .",

    "first , the slopes of @xmath188 and @xmath189 do not have a spike near @xmath240 .",

    "we inject energy at @xmath240 at a fixed rate , equal to that found in steady state in the previous simulation . for the initial condition",

    "it is very similar to that found in the corresponding kinetic simulation ( figure [ fig : ke2 ] ) .",
    "in incompressible mhd , diffusive dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energies is accounted for by addition of the terms @xmath321 and @xmath322 to the right - hand sides of equations ( [ eq : eomv ] ) and ( [ eq : eomb ] ) , respectively , where @xmath99 is the viscosity and @xmath323 is the resistivity . the magnetic prandtl number is defined as @xmath324 until now , we have assumed that pr@xmath325 . in this section ,",

    "when we take the dot product of the fourier - transformed equation with @xmath330 , and then take the expectation value of the result , we can neglect the dissipation term proportional to @xmath331 , since it is much smaller than the term proportional to @xmath332 .",

    "the kinetic equation for high magnetic prandtl number is the same as that for pr@xmath325 ( eq . [ [ eq : kineticequation ] ] ) , but with @xmath334 replaced by @xmath335 .",

    "the energy spectra are cut off below the viscous scale , i.e. , the scale set by @xmath99 ( eq . [ [ eq : ldiss ] ] , within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "one might have expected that the viscous scale should only affect the kinetic energy spectrum . yet",
    "the magnetic energy spectrum is also cut off below the viscous scale .",
    "this can be understood as follows : upgoing waves each have equal magnetic and kinetic energies , and similarly for downgoing waves . as an up - wave with lengthscale slightly larger than the viscous scale",
    "is gradually cascaded to sub - viscous scales , its kinetic energy is dissipated by viscosity . since the cascade time in weak turbulence is much longer than the waveperiod , as the up - wave s kinetic energy is dissipated , its magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy so that its magnetic and kinetic energies can remain nearly equal . as a result ,",
    "both kinetic and magnetic energies are dissipated at the viscous scale .",
    "in many different types of turbulent cascades , the energy spectrum exhibits a hump on scales slightly larger than the dissipation scale ( e.g. , falkovich 1994 ) . the hump is particularly pronounced in numerical simulations that use `` hyperviscosity , '' a trick whereby the diffusive term @xmath336 is replaced by @xmath337 , where @xmath338 is typically 4 or 8 , and @xmath339 is the hyperviscosity ; the resistivity is modified in a similar manner ( e.g. , borue & orszag 1995 , biskamp 2000 ) . with this trick , a smaller part of the spectrum is affected by dissipation , so a longer inertial range can be simulated with a fixed resolution .",
    "although this trick does work , there is a problem : the spectrum on scales slightly larger than the dissipation scales is made flatter .",
    "the energy , in effect , is backed up .",
    "this is the bottleneck effect .",
    "it can be particularly problematic in simulations of strong mhd turbulence , where the energy backup can affect lengthscales considerably larger than the dissipative scales ( biskamp & mller 2000 ) .",

    "if the bottleneck effect appears , its interpretation will be simpler than in strong turbulence .",
    "we perform two simulations of the kinetic equation , one with hyperviscosity of the form @xmath341 , and the other with @xmath340 . in each simulation",
    ", we fix the energies at the outer scale , @xmath343 , @xmath281 , and allow the spectra to reach steady state .",
    "the steady state spectra of @xmath344 are shown in figure [ fig : bottle ] , offset for clarity .",
    "also shown is the simulation with ordinary viscosity described in ",
    "[ sec : fixedenergy ] . from this figure",
    "it is apparent that weak turbulence suffers from the bottleneck effect ; the effect becomes larger with increasing hyperviscous exponent .",
    "the bottleneck effect can be understood as follows .",
    "consider an up - wave with a lengthscale slightly larger than the dissipation scale .",
    "it is cascaded by down - waves that have slightly different lengthscales than its own .",
    "hyperviscosity gives a sharper dissipative cutoff to the down - wave spectrum than ordinary viscosity .",
    "therefore a hyperviscous simulation has fewer down - waves in the vicinity of the dissipation scale , and the cascade time of the up - wave is longer . for the up - wave energy flux to be independent of lengthscale , a longer cascade time implies a larger energy . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum is flatter on scales slightly larger than dissipative ones .",
    "falkovich ( 1994 ) offers a similar explanation for the bottleneck effect in hydro turbulence .",
    "in this paper we describe imbalanced weak turbulence and solve the steady state cascade . in a future paper",
    ", we will extend the result to the strong cascade .",
    "one of our ultimate goals is to develop a theory of imbalanced strong turbulence to apply to the solar wind , where imbalance is observed .",
    "although strong turbulence is more generally applicable than weak , the latter is a simple and illuminating model .",
    "there are a number of issues in strong turbulence that are not understood .",
    "weak turbulence can be used as the first step in explaining them .",
    "for example , in this paper we examined the effect of a large magnetic prandtl number on weak mhd turbulence .",
    "we also found that the bottleneck effect appears in weak turbulence , where its interpretation is straightforward .",
    "there are a number of other issues that we intend to investigate in weak turbulence as a prelude to understanding them in strong turbulence ; for example , reconnection and the turbulent dynamo .",
    "research reported in this paper was supported by nsf grant ast-0098301 .",
    "we consider the evolution of @xmath48 in a plane that is transverse to @xmath12 and moving with velocity @xmath345 , i.e. , with fixed @xmath333 . recall that @xmath12 is in the direction of the mean magnetic field .",

    "nonlinearity arises because @xmath48 modifies @xmath23 ( through eq .",

    "it does not require an infinite time for @xmath369 to interact with @xmath518 ; rather , the only quantity that enters into @xmath518 is the value of @xmath358 within the time @xmath362 of @xmath500 .",

    "one of our reasons for discussing the fourier - space picture in detail is that there have been a large number of confusing remarks about it in the literature .",
    "for example , galtier et al . (",
    "2000 , 2002 ) claim that , since the kinetic equation is apparently not applicable to the zero - frequency mode , there might be a `` condensation '' of zero - frequency modes .",
    "since the zero - frequency mode is so important , this condensation might have dramatic implications for the cascade .",
    "however , as long as correlation times are shorter than cascade times , the kinetic equation gives a complete description of the turbulence , and is applicable to the zero - frequency mode as well , which is simply given by @xmath522 .",
    "for this not to be true , large - time correlations would have to build up in @xmath358 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : qomega ] ] ) .",
    "since @xmath358 corresponds to @xmath438 in weak mhd turbulence , large - time correlations at fixed @xmath346 correspond to large - distance correlations along the @xmath183-direction .",
    "but it is impossible for two downgoing wavepackets , initially uncorrelated , to become correlated .",
    "this is because the equation for their evolution is linear : recall that in weak turbulence the backreaction term is negligible .",
