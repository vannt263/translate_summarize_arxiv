    "the smallest special unitary group that allows embedding of the standard model ( sm ) is @xmath0  @xcite . on account of its unique symmetry breaking pattern",
    "@xmath0 represents a fundamental framework to test the idea of grand unification .",
    "it is thus necessary to have clear understanding of its generic predictions and testable consequences .",
    "the most dramatic prediction of grand unified theories by far is the decay of the proton  @xcite .",
    "this generic feature has accordingly been a prime target of numerous experimental searches but a positive signal has not yet been observed .",
    "nevertheless , existing experimental limits on the proton decay lifetime have already placed rather severe bounds on simple models of grand unification .",
    "this is especially applicable to the minimal models based on @xmath0 which will be our preferred framework of interest",
    ". we will in particular focus on the current status of these models  in their supersymmetric form  with respect to the latest experimental results on proton decay .",
    "as is well - known non - supersymmetric grand unified theories , in particular the simplest realizations of the ordinary @xmath0 , were considered for a long time to be ruled out by proton decay .",
    "however , it was shown recently that there still exists viable parameter space in minimal realistic models that is yet to be excluded  @xcite .",
    "also , it has turned out that proton decay might be absent altogether in a class of models based on flipped @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "both results draw from a recent study that focused on all relevant contributions to proton decay in non - supersymmetric guts  @xcite .",
    "the situation with the status of the minimal supersymmetric @xmath0  @xcite grand unified theory is more involved .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that supersymmetry generates a large number of model dependent proton decay contributions in addition to the non - supersymmetric ones making general analysis intricate . in the context of flipped susy @xmath0 the dimension six gauge contributions for proton decay are the most important",
    "therefore , there is no problem to satisfy the current experimental bound on the proton lifetime .    in this work",
    "we study the unification constraints in the context of minimal supersymmetric models based on @xmath0 and the corresponding implications for proton decay . to be as broad as possible we will look at both types of minimal supersymmetric matter unification under @xmath0the ordinary and flipped one . in minimal supersymmetric @xmath0",
    "we investigate the case when the fields in the adjoint representation @xmath2 ( triplet of @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( octet of @xmath5 ) are not degenerated .",
    "in flipped susy su(5 ) we study the most general unification constraints .",
    "the constraints coming from proton decay are discussed in both models .",
    "we find a lower bound on the proton decay lifetime in flipped susy @xmath0 and conclude that it will be very difficult to test both models , minimal susy @xmath0 and flipped susy @xmath0 , at future proton decay experiments through the dimension six operators .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in section  1 we show the most general unification constraints in minimal supersymmetric @xmath0 and their implications for proton decay predictions . in section  2",
    "we present the relevant predictions in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric version of flipped @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section iii .",
    "minimal susy @xmath0  @xcite unifies one generation of matter of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in two superfields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while its higgs sector comprises @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in our notation",
    "the sm decomposition of the adjoint higgs superfield reads @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , it needs to accommodate at least two @xmath0 singlet superfields in order to generate observed neutrino masses or use the bilinear r - parity violating interactions .",
    "it has been claimed that this theory , in its renormalizable form and with _ low - energy susy _ , was excluded on the proton decay grounds  @xcite . for previous studies",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown  @xcite that in order to satisfy the experimentally established lower bound on proton lifetime the mass @xmath12 of the triplet fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 had to be greater than the upper bound on @xmath12 that was extracted from requirement to have successful gauge coupling unification . however , it is well - known that the minimal renormalizable susy @xmath0 is not realistic since it is not possible to establish phenomenologically consistent fermion masses and mixings within its framework .",
    "so , the above claim seems redundant to say the least .",
    "in fact , any study that aims to rule out any given gut on the proton decay grounds should be undertaken within a realistic scenario for fermion masses and mixings .",
    "we will adhere to this principle in our study .    in order to keep susy @xmath0 minimal but realistic with respect to the quark and lepton mass spectrum it is sufficient to take into account nonrenormalizable operators in the yukawa sector  @xcite .",
    "these operators modify the bad relation @xmath15 in a way that renders theory realistic . as usual , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the down quark ( charged lepton ) yukawa matrix .",
    "once these operators are present the couplings of the triplet higgs to matter are also modified .",
    "in fact , one can even set to zero all the couplings of the triplets to matter  @xcite .",
    "this in turn practically removes any phenomenological bound on the triplet mass .",
    "it is thus clear that it is rather difficult to rule out the entire parameter space of the minimal susy @xmath0 .",
    "this issue has been studied in detail in reference  @xcite , while the impact of the higher - dimensional operators on proton decay has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "if the higher - dimensional operators are allowed in the yukawa sector one should for consistency also consider other possible nonrenormalizable operator contributions and investigate their impact on the viability of the theory .",
    "we refer to two additional types of operators in particular .",
    "the first type modifies the mass spectrum of the higgs fields responsible for the gut symmetry breaking with respect to the renormalizable case  @xcite .",
    "the second type affects boundary conditions for the gauge coupling unification through modification of the gauge kinetic terms  @xcite .",
    "it is our intention to investigate in detail influence of the first type of operators on the predictions of the theory .",
    "as we will show , these modifications alone are sufficient to make theory realistic with respect to the proton decay constraints .",
    "this relaxes the need to fine - tune relevant yukawa couplings to simultaneously recreate observed masses and mixings and suppress couplings of the triplet to matter .",
    "preliminary study of their impact has already been presented in ref .",
    "our analysis will not only be more detailed but will also reflect recent improvements in our knowledge of low - energy data as given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will investigate consequences of particular realizations of the susy spectrum on the proton decay predictions .",
    "it should finally be mentioned that even the second type of operators is self sufficient in rendering theory realistic with respect to proton decay bounds  @xcite .",
    "the mass splitting between octet ( @xmath4 ) and triplet ( @xmath2 ) of adjoint higgs superfield as the simplest way to satisfy conservative experimental bound on @xmath12 within the minimal susy @xmath0 framework has first been suggested in ref .",
    "the idea is based on the fact that @xmath12 scales as @xmath18 if successful gauge coupling unification at the one - loop level is imposed .",
    "hence , sufficiently strong @xmath4-@xmath2 mass splitting could lead to @xmath12 being heavy enough to avoid even the most conservative constraints coming from experimental results on partial proton decay lifetimes .",
    "however , this approach can not be implemented in renormalizable theory where @xmath19 . to break this degeneracy",
    "one needs to consider presence of nonrenormalizable contributions which are anyhow necessary in order to accommodate observed masses of quarks and leptons  @xcite .    to outline how this idea works",
    "let us consider the superpotential up to the first order in @xmath20 .",
    "it reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the order of the gut scale ( @xmath23 ) while @xmath24 can be identified with the scale of gravity ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "if only the first two terms are taken into consideration one obtains @xmath26 if @xmath22 points in the sm direction .",
    "this hinders the possibility of increasing @xmath12 to arbitrarily high scale since , as we said before , @xmath12 depends on @xmath27 and @xmath28 only through their ratio .",
    "if , on the other hand , one considers a more general scenario  when all the terms in eq .",
    "are taken into account ",
    "it is possible to have very wide range of values for the ratio in question .",
    "for example , if one neglects for simplicity the term proportional to @xmath29 in eq .",
    "one obtains @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "that is more than sufficient to bring even the most conservative predictions of the minimal susy @xmath0 in agreement with experimental findings as we show later .    to explicitly show how @xmath2-@xmath4 mass splitting enters into prediction for @xmath12 we must resort to renormalization group equations for the sm gauge couplings . at the one - loop level , they are given by : _",
    "1 ^ -1 ( m_z ) & = & _ ^-1 + ( + + - 10 + ) , _ 2 ^ -1 ( m_z ) & = & _ ^-1 + ( - + + 2 - 6 + 2 ) , _ 3 ^ -1 ( m_z ) & = & _ ^-1 + + & + & ( - 7 + 2 + 2 - 4 + + 3 ) . + [ rgesusy ] here , for simplicity we assume the same mass @xmath31 for all mssm scalars , i.e. , sfermions and the extra higgs doublet , and the same mass @xmath32 for higgsinos and gauginos .",
    "we comment on a more general scenario that accommodates the splitting between the relevant gaugino masses later on . as usual",
    ", @xmath33 is the mass of superheavy gauge bosons while @xmath34 represents the scale where gauge couplings unify .",
    "we assume @xmath35 in what follows which is especially justified in the two - loop analysis which we also present towards the end of this section .",
    "it is easy to solve for @xmath12 in terms of all other mass scales that appear in  .",
    "if we eliminate @xmath36 we end up with two equations .",
    "they read [ tripletmass ] m_t & = & ( ) ^5/2 ( m_^4 m _ m_z)^1/6  , + & = &  .",
    "[ m3 ] of course , @xmath12 and @xmath33 are then related through [ second ] m_t =  .",
    "clearly , @xmath12 scales as @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "thus , the larger the @xmath37 ratio is the larger @xmath12 becomes as we initially suggested . if this ratio is set to one then eq .",
    "simplifies and @xmath12 can consequently be easily constrained by low energy input and assumptions with regard to the susy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that the triplet mass is too light to satisfy experimental constraints  @xcite from proton decay if one neglects the higher dimensional operators and the quark and lepton mixings . in this case",
    "we get the strongest bound on the colored triplet mass .",
    "so , how much should the ratio depart from one if we want @xmath12 to be above the most conservative experimental bound ?    to answer that we first update the result of ref .",
    "@xcite according to which the current bound on the partial proton lifetime@xmath38years  implies the following bound on the triplet mass : @xmath39gev . using this conservative constraint , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 we obtain from   the one - loop result [ borut ] m__3 > 2.0 m__8 .",
    "so , if one allows for the presence of nonrenormalizable contributions in the superpotential one can certainly make minimal susy @xmath0  @xcite realistic as long as eq",
    ".   holds without the need to suppress couplings of the triplet to the matter .",
    "in fact , since there are two relevant equations , we obtain an additional constrain .",
    "namely , eq",
    ".   simultaneously implies @xmath42gev in order that @xmath43 .",
    "let us now study unification constraints on the spectrum of the minimal realistic susy @xmath0 in detail . using   and",
    "we can plot the parameter space allowed by unification in the @xmath27-@xmath28 plane for fixed values of @xmath12 and @xmath35 .",
    "the whole parameter space is shown in fig .  [ fig : parameter1 ] assuming different values of @xmath44 and @xmath31 .",

    "[ fig : parameter1 ] is the region bounded from above by @xmath45 , from the left by @xmath46 and from the right by @xmath47 .",

    "[ fig : parameter1]b the corresponding parameter space for the so - called `` split susy '' scenario  @xcite is shown . to implement relevant experimental bounds on the masses of susy particles we use ref .  @xcite . clearly , the allowed region for @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1]b has been considerably reduced with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1]a . in all those plots",
    "we observe the well known fact that the contributions of the fermionic superpartners are very important for unification , while the contributions of the extra scalars are not relevant at one loop . in order to appreciate this effect",
    "notice the differences between fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1]c where the gaugino mass changes from @xmath52gev to @xmath53tev and the unification scale for @xmath26 is always above @xmath54gev in the latter . in all scenarios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1 ] unification scale can be naturally at the string scale  @xcite .",
    "we recall that the triplets could be light once their couplings to matter are suppressed  @xcite . to stress that point we show the possibility to achieve unification in this case in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightmt ] .",
    "it is generated with the same values of input parameters as fig .",
    "[ fig : parameter1]a but this time we include the region where both @xmath55 and @xmath13 are very light .",
    "that region could be probed at future colliders , particularly at the lhc . for relevant signals at future colliders",
    "see reference  @xcite .",
    "now , let us study the unification constraints at two - loop level .",
    "at the two - loop level , @xmath12 picks up dependence on the absolute mass scale of @xmath56 .",
    "this means that if one considers @xmath26 case and allows @xmath57 to be below @xmath12 one can establish an upper bound on @xmath12 _ only _ after one imposes a condition that @xmath34 is below some natural cutoff .",
    "for example , if we take that cutoff to be @xmath25 , the correct bound for @xmath58 , @xmath59tev and @xmath60tev reads @xmath61gev . here , @xmath62 represents the mass of the triplet for the case when @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath63 in order for successful unification to take place .",
    "this range of values for @xmath62 is obtained by allowing for arbitrary absolute mass scale of degenerate @xmath2 and @xmath4 fields . for the values quoted in eq .",
    "this scale varies between @xmath64gev for the upper bound and @xmath65gev for the lower bound , respectively . obviously , the constraint on @xmath62 is rather tight .",
    "quoted uncertainties in eq .",
    "reflect @xmath66 uncertainty in @xmath67 as given in  @xcite .",
    "we stress again that the upper bound is cutoff dependent .",
    "if we depart from the @xmath26 assumption then the upper limit on @xmath12 basically corresponds to the cutoff of the theory .",
    "we opt to present the two - loop analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] as a contour plot of the masses of @xmath4 and higgs triplet fields in the @xmath34-@xmath37 plane . in order to generate it we use values for gauge couplings at @xmath68 taken from ref .",
    "in addition , we take into account ckm mixing parameters as given in ref .",
    "@xcite and include the effect of all three families .",
    "we consider only the @xmath58 case . in our analysis",
    "the exact numerical solutions is generated for sufficient number of points to have smooth interpolation .",
    "some comments are in order with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] . vertical errors on the points that give @xmath69gev line correspond to the case when @xmath70 is varied within @xmath66 while @xmath34 and @xmath12 are kept fixed .",
    "in other words , what is varied there are the ratio @xmath37 and @xmath28 .",
    "horizontal errors on one of the points on the @xmath69gev line also correspond to the @xmath66 variation in @xmath71 .",
    "this time @xmath28 and @xmath34 are varied with @xmath37 and @xmath12 held fixed .",
    "both types of error bars are given to demonstrate the impact of the least experimentally known input parameter .",
    "the dependence on @xmath72 is practically negligible .",
    "the only other major dependence of @xmath12 is on the exact spectrum of the susy particles here encoded in parameters @xmath32 and @xmath31 for simplicity .",
    "this dependence can be treated in a satisfactory manner only if and when this spectrum is experimentally establish and/or better constrained . in any case , if we assume @xmath73gev instead of @xmath74tev then @xmath69gev line in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] is given by the thick line .",
    "as one can see , the `` overall '' change in the susy scale within the region that can be directly probed in experiments is still less significant than the uncertainty in @xmath75 .",
    "there is however one important point that regards exact susy spectrum that we need to address .",
    "namely , it is well known that the gut scale unification of gaugino masses implies that @xmath76 at any given scale up to small corrections .",
    "here @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the bino , wino and gluino masses , respectively .",
    "we can thus infer that at low - scale gaugino unification predicts @xmath80 .",
    "this , on the other hand , is obviously in conflict with our assumption of gaugino degeneracy .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that , at the one - loop level , @xmath12 scales as @xmath81 .",
    "so , @xmath12 dependence on the ratio of relevant gaugino masses is less severe than on the @xmath27-@xmath28 mass splitting . in other words , we have captured the dominant effect that controls predictions for @xmath12 within the minimal framework .",
    "but , if one assumes that this pattern of gaugino masses is indeed the correct one it is easy to apply it to our analysis . for example , the limits that are quoted in eq .   should be divided by 8 .",
    "only then our results could be compared with the existing results in the literature such as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] covers the parameter space of the minimal susy @xmath0 in both renormalizable and nonrenormalizable case and it extends only to @xmath82gev .",
    "we show the explicit dependence of @xmath12 on all relevant parameters , including @xmath34 and absolute scale of @xmath28 .",
    "gray box in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] marks a point at which @xmath83 , while empty box represents a point where @xmath84 .",
    "note that the error bars at the latter point correspond to the @xmath66 variation of @xmath75 as shown on the left side of eq .  .",
    "the error bars are much smaller there with respect to error bars elsewhere since only @xmath62 is allowed to vary to generate successful unification .",
    "last point we want to discuss is the fact that more recent lattice qcd evaluations  @xcite of the proton decay matrix element consistently imply a value that is larger than the value ( @xmath85gev@xmath86 ) used to derive the limit @xmath39gev . ref .",
    "@xcite offers alternative , even more stringent experimental limit on @xmath12 , based on the value @xmath87gev@xmath86  @xcite .",
    "when we update it to incorporate the latest experimental bound on the partial proton lifetime it reads @xmath88gev .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] that even this limit can be satisfied with @xmath89 .    as far as the correctness of the eq .",
