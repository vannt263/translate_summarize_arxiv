    "this asymmetry affects the extraction of @xmath4 from neutrino dis processes@xcite .",
    "a precise understanding on the cross - secrion for @xmath5 production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) depends on the strange sea distributions at small @xmath6 region",
    ". however , the strange sea distributions are not well determined compared with those for the light quark sea .",
    "the hermes collaboration recently presents their measurement of helicity averaged and helicity dependent parton distributions of the strange quark sea in the nucleon from charge kaon production in deep - inelastic scattering on the deuteron@xcite .",
    "the severest constrain on the strange and antistrange distributions before the hermes measurement comes from the neutrino(antineutrino)-nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in which two muons are produced in the final state , i.e. @xmath7 . most data for such processes are provided by the ccfr@xcite and nutev@xcite collaborations .",
    "there are two dominant mechanisms for the quark sea production in the nucleon : ( i ) gluons splitting into quak - antiquark pairs , and ( ii ) contributions from the meson - baryond components in the nucleon .",
    "while the sea distributions generated through mechanism ( i ) can be assumed to be flavour independent ( su(3 ) flavour symmetric ) , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 and quark - antiquark symmetric , i.e. @xmath10 , the sea distributions generated through mechanism ( ii ) violate these symmetries .",

    "flavour symmetry and quark - antiquark symmetry for the sea distributions generated via mechanism ( i ) , we can construct a quantity ( x)=(x)+(x)-s(x)-(x ) , [ delta ] which has a leading contribution from mechanism ( ii ) , and can be calculated using non - perturbative models describing that mechanism .",
    "we present a calculation of @xmath3 in the meson cloud model ( mcm)@xcite by considering fock states involving mesons in the pseudoscalar and vector octets and baryons in the octet and decuplet . combining our calculation for @xmath3 with results for the light antiquark sea distributions from global pdf",
