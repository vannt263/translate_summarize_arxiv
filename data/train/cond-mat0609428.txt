    "the corrosion of metalic surfaces is a subject of increasing interest due to widespread use of corrodable materials with all the economical and environmental implications @xcite .",
    "when the metal is in contact with an aggressive solution , the formation of a passive layer containing the metal oxide is observed after the corrosion of the topmost layer of the surface .",
    "as this layer grows , it more efficiently protects the surface from the attack of the solution , leading to the slowdown of the corrosion rate .",
    "for instance , according to the cabrera and mott@xcite law , the corrosion front is expected to move as @xmath9 ( growth rate decreasing as @xmath2 ) , which is in agreement with experimental findings .",
    "the changes in the corrosion rate are certainly accompanied by changes in the roughness of the front separating the metal and the passive layer . in the beginning of the process ,",
    "all the surface is uniformly exposed to the corrosive solution , but after the formation of the passive layer there appear points of easier or more difficult access to the solution .",
    "it is particularly important to investigate the scaling properties of the roughness because they are intimately connected to the main dynamical processes during the interface evolution @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", additional motivation comes from the renewed interest in systems whose competitive dynamics leads to crossover in roughness scaling @xcite .    here",
    "we will analyze the crossover in the front evolution and in the roughness scaling of a recently introduced model for the corrosion of a metalic surface by a solution @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanisms of the model are the corrosion of the mettalic surface exposed to the solution and the formation of the passive layer with the oxides .",
    "the layer is assumed to be porous , but the larger molar volumes of the products may block the pores and , consequently , diffusive relaxation of the volume excess is necessary for new corrosion events .",
    "this model was not devised to represent a particular real process @xcite , but to contain essential ingredients of a large variety of corrosion processes , allowing the investigation of universal features .",
    "previous numerical work on this model has shown significant differences in the corrosion fronts for small and large values of the local corrosion rate of the metal in contact with the solution @xcite . however , besides these qualitative features , only universal laws for the global growth rates in limiting cases were already derived @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we advance the quantitative study of the model , focusing on the properties of the corrosion front which separates the metal and the passive layer .",
    "we show the emergence of a crossover in the global growth rate accompanied by a crossover in surface roughness scaling , from a short time kpz behavior to long time laplacian growth ( or diffusion - limited erosion - dle ) @xcite . a scaling picture of the process is derived , along the same lines of those developed for related systems @xcite , and the results are confirmed by numerical simulation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model for corrosion and passivation . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a scaling theory for the front growth and numerical results that confirm it . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the crossover kpz - dle of the surface roughness . in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the model represents a system with the structure shown in fig .",
    "while the metal is corroded , a porous passive layer grows , with some products filling their pores .",
    "these products block the access of the solution to the surface , but they may diffuse and leave the surface of the metal exposed again .    for simplicity , the model is defined in a lattice , where the sites may have three different states : m ( metal ) , s ( solution ) or p ( passive ) .",
    "the lattice sites represent the dominant chemical species inside one a mesoscopic region . due to computational limitations of memory and time ,",
    "a square lattice will be considered in our numerical work . in order to represent the effect of the porosity of the passive layer ,",
    "we assume that a site m can be corroded ( passivated ) even when it is in contact only with p sites , thus avoiding the complication of representing the porous structure of the passive layer . the excess of products will be represented by particles w , which can only lay at p sites and may diffuse through the p matrix . at",
    "most one particle w is allowed at each p site .",
    "a region of the lattice is illustrated in fig .",
    "1b .    in the beginning of the process ,",
    "all sites above a certain row of the lattice ( height @xmath10 ) are labeled s , and all sites below or at that row are labeled m. an m site is said to be in contact with the solution if it has at least one neighbor s or one neighbor p without a w particle over it . at each time unit , each m satisfying this condition may be changed into p with probability @xmath0 ( reaction @xmath11 ) .",
    "it corresponds to the reduction of a chemical species in the solution by the metal and the formation of an insoluble film . a reaction @xmath11 is illustrated for the central site in fig . 2a . on the other hand ,",
    "2b shows a case where this reaction is not possible for the central m site due to the blocking effect of the w particle .",
    "we assume that the molar volume of the oxide products is larger than that of the metal ( pilling and bedworth factor larger than one @xcite ) , and we represent this excess by creation of w particles after the reaction @xmath11 .",
    "two w particles are produced immediately after each reaction : the first one lays at the newly created p site and the second one lays at a neighboring p or s site . the creation of the new w particles is also illustrated in fig .",
    "some differences between models with creation of one or two w particles per reaction were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the particles w may also diffuse through the p layer .",
    "this represents some type of stress relaxation which leads to the redistribution of the excess of corrosion products @xcite . at each time unit , each w attempts to execute @xmath1 random displacements to neighboring sites .",
    "the movement is possible only if the target site is p or s and if it does not contain a w particle , otherwise the attempt is rejected .",
    "an acceptable movement is illustrated in fig .",
    "2c , but an attempt to move the same w particle to any other direction would be rejected in that case .    when a w particle attempts to move to an s site , or when the w particle is created over an s site ( top of the passive layer ) , this s site is converted into p.",
    "this condition is reasonable to represent the expansion of the passive layer towards the solution side .",
    "however , it does not have a significant influence on the corrosion front , which separates the metal and the passive layer , and which is the main interest of the present study .",
    "here we focus on the case of small corrosion rates @xmath0 and of not very small values of @xmath1 .",
    "first we consider the short time behavior of the system . in one time unit ,",
    "the number of corroded sites is small compared to the total number of sites in the front , but all w particles attempt to move during the same time interval .",
    "the diffusion of w particles removes the restrictions for the corrosion and the situation in fig .",
    "2b is rare : the w particle at the neighboring p site will move away long before a successful corrosion attempt occurs at the central site . consequently",
    ", we expect that all m sites at the interface are available for corrosion with equal probabilities .",
    "the distance of the corrosion front from the initial level , hereafter called the height of the corrosion front , increases as @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is being measured in lattice units ) . in this regime ,",
    "the model is equivalent to an inverse of the eden model @xcite , in which a new particle is added to a randomly chosen neighbor of the aggregate surface at each time step .",
    "now consider the system at long times .",
    "since w particles move diffusively , their upwards displacement away from the corrosion front increases as @xmath14 , thus their velocity in the upwards direction evolves as @xmath15 \\sim { \\left ( d / t\\right)}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this decreasing velocity leads to the accumulation of w particles near the surface , which block new corrosion events .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig.3 , where a sea of w particles is shown at the bottom of the passive layer .",
    "the crossover from the initial regime to the long time one takes place at a characteristic time @xmath8 in which the height of the sea of w particles covers a finite fraction of the passive layer .",
    "the height of that sea increases as @xmath16 because it is determined by the diffusion of w particles produced at short times . on the other hand , the height of the passive layer increases as eq .",
    "( [ hini ] ) before the crossover . matching these heights",
    "we obtain the crossover time @xmath17 the height of the corrosion front at the crossover , measured in lattice units , is @xmath18    after the crossover , a corrosion event is possible only when an m site has an empty neighbor p , which requires the migration of voids ( holes ) through the sea of w particles and their arrival at the corrosion front .",
    "when the m site is corroded ( reaction @xmath11 ) , the hole of the w sea disappears because it is occupied by one of the new w particles .",
    "since these holes move diffusively from the top of the w sea to that front ( similarly to the w particles ) , we conclude that that the corrosion front will also move diffusively , with displacement increasing as @xmath9 and velocity decreasing as @xmath2 .",
    "the time evolution of the height @xmath19 of the corrosion front is expected to follow a scaling relation that involves @xmath20 and @xmath8 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a scaling function . indeed , with @xmath23 for small times , we regain eq .",
    "( [ hini ] ) , and with @xmath24 for long times we obtain @xmath25 , in agreement with the above discussion .    in order to test the scaling relation ( [ scalingh ] ) , we use simulation data for several values of @xmath0 , ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . these data were obtained in lattices with lateral length @xmath29 and periodic boundary conditions . in fig .",
    "4 we show a scaling plot of @xmath30 versus @xmath31 , which are respectively proportional to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the excellent data collapse of the results for consecutive values of @xmath0 shows that there is a universal relation between those quantities .",
    "lines with slopes @xmath32 and @xmath33 are also included in the plot in order to highlight the crossover from the @xmath34 growth to the @xmath35 growth .    in previous numerical works with small and large @xmath0 @xcite , this universal behavior was not observed because , for a single value of @xmath0 , it is difficult to span a time interval long enough to show both scaling regimes .",
    "numerical studies in three dimensions would certainly be more difficult .",
    "however , the scaling picture will be the same in three dimensions because it is derived from diffusion properties and the same stochastic rules for the model .",
    "for small times , the equivalence to the eden model ( sec .",
    "iii ) indicates that the corrosion model is in the kpz class of growth @xcite , i. e. in the continuous limit it is represented by the kpz equation @xmath36 here , @xmath19 is the height at the position @xmath37 in a @xmath38-dimensional substrate at time @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants and @xmath42 is a gaussian noise  @xcite . in the growth regime ,",
    "the lateral correlation length is much smaller than the lattice length and the roughness increases as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is called the growth exponent ( @xmath45 in @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 in @xmath48 @xcite ) and @xmath49 is an amplitude related to the coefficients of the kpz equation .    in the original eden model ,",
    "each site of the front can grow with probability @xmath32 at each time unit @xcite",
    ". however , the corrosion of an m site in our model takes place with probability @xmath0 per time unit .",
    "thus , for small times we expect that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant related to eden growth properties . in fig .",
    "5 we show a log - log plot of the small time roughness as a function of @xmath52 , for small @xmath0 , confirming the validity of eq .",
    "( [ wkpz ] ) .",
    "the average slope of this plot is significantly below the asymptotic kpz value @xmath45 , but these short time deviations are expected in the eden model @xcite as well as in related kpz models @xcite .    at long times , a corrosion event takes place when a void of the w sea arrives at the metal surface , after performing a random walk which begins at a distant point .",
    "consequently , surface peaks will be more easily subject to corrosion than the valleys of the surface , which favors the production of surfaces with low roughness , as observed in previous numerical works for high values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these features indicate that the long time regime is equivalent to that of the dle model @xcite . in dle ,",
    "eroding particles are randomly left at points very distant from the solid surface , they are allowed to diffuse and , when they reach the surface , they are annihilated together with the particle of the solid . in our model , the eroding particles of dle",
    "are represented by the holes of the w sea .    in the continuous description of dle",
    ", the stable interface is driven by the gradient of a laplacian field @xcite .",
    "a logarithmic scaling of the squared roughness is predicted in @xmath53 dimensions : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the growth velocity , @xmath39 is the time , @xmath56 is the lattice parameter and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a lengthscale associated with the noise @xcite .",
    "our model is equivalent to a dle with a probability @xmath0 of the incident particle to remove a particle of the solid .",
    "moreover , changes in the time scale are also expected because the growth rate of our model decreases in time , while it is constant in the original dle @xcite .",
    "thus , for a connection of the dle roughness in eq .",
    "( [ wlaplacian ] ) and that of our model , we use @xmath59 as the height of the corrosion front and @xmath60 .",
    "this gives @xmath61 where @xmath19 is measured in lattice units and @xmath62 is a time - independent constant associated with the noise ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "the time scaling of the surface roughness , implicitly given in its relation with the height @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ wdle ] ) , is tested in fig .",
    "6 , where we plot @xmath63 as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "large values of @xmath31 were chosen in order to ensure that only data in the long time regime were considered ( @xmath64 - see fig .",
    "4 ) , but simulations for extremely long times are feasible only for large @xmath0 .",
    "we notice that , for a given value of @xmath0 , @xmath65 oscillates around some constant value , which provides the estimate of the constant @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ wdle ] .",
    "the crossover from kpz to dle scaling is expected to take place at a time of order @xmath8 because the changes in the growth rate and in the roughness scaling are caused by the same mechanisms .",
    "in other models with crossover between different growth dynamics , it is observed that matching the scaling relations for the roughness of both dynamics leads to correct predictions of @xmath8 @xcite . following this reasoning , the @xmath66 values in eqs .",
    "( [ wkpz ] ) and ( [ wdle ] ) must be the same at time @xmath67 and for a height @xmath68 .",
    "this gives @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants . in order to test relation ( [ eqb ] ) , we plot @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 in fig .",
    "we obtain a reasonable linear fit of the data for three orders of magnitude of @xmath0 , which suggests the validity of our approach .",
    "the crossover of surface roughness is slightly different in @xmath74 dimensions because the exponent @xmath44 of the kpz class is changed @xcite and the roughness of dle saturates at a finite value @xcite .",
    "however , the model rules indicate that the short and long time dynamics are also kpz and laplacian growth , respectively .",
    "we studied the crossover from kardar - parisi - zhang growth to laplacian front growth in a model for corrosion and passivation of a metalic surface . at small times , a regime of constant growth of the corrosion front is observed , with the roughness obeying kpz scaling . at long times ,",
    "a large fraction of the layer is blocked , leading to a global corrosion rate that decreases as @xmath2 .",
    "the roughness shows logarithmic scaling , with amplitudes depending on the corrosion probability @xmath0 .",
    "scaling arguments show that the crossover between these different dynamics takes place at @xmath67 , and that the height of the corrosion front at that time is @xmath68 .",
    "universal scaling relations between the height of the corrosion front @xmath19 and the time @xmath39 are obtained , as well as relations for the surface roughness .",
    "all results are confirmed by numerical simulations in square lattices , although the scaling arguments are also valid in three - dimensions .",
    "as far as we know , the crossover from kpz to dle scaling in statistical growth models was not predicted before .",
    "the inverse situation , i. e. the crossover from dle ( short times ) to kpz ( long times ) was suggested to appear in an extension of the dle model where the movement of the eroding particles is biased towards the surface @xcite .",
    "however , recent simulation results suggest a crossover to edwards - wilkinson scaling instead of kpz @xcite .",
    "we also recall that the crossover of our model must not be confused with the widely studied crossover from kpz to diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) - see e. g. ref . @xcite .",
    "indeed , surface roughness scaling is very different in dle and dla .",
    "the universal behavior discussed here may be observed in real systems where the basic features illustrated in fig .",
    "1 are expected .",
    "such tests are certainly possible with the modern techniques of microscopy , that allow the determination of surface roughness with good accuracy",
    ". one of the interesting points for comparison is the time behavior of the roughness , which evolves from a rapid growth , typical of kpz scaling , to a very slow growth , typical of the logarithmic scaling in laplacian front growth .",
    "moreover , it would also be interesting to confirm the association of the changes in the growth rate with the changes in roughness scaling ."
