    "in unparticle physics , the standard model is extended by couplings to a conformal sector through interactions of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an operator of the conformal sector , and @xmath8 is a standard model operator  @xcite",
    ". the conformal sector may be weakly - coupled  @xcite or strongly - coupled  @xcite , but in all cases , the conformality of the new sector leads to effects that can not be explained in terms of standard particle states .    to date ,",
    "all unparticle studies are based on two key elements :  the unparticle phase space , and the unparticle propagator .",
    "conformal invariance fixes unparticle phase space  @xcite , which enters processes with unparticles in the final state , such as @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , conformal invariance dictates the form of the unparticle propagator  @xcite , which determines virtual unparticle contributions to processes such as @xmath10 .",
    "the forms of the unparticle phase space and propagator imply that unparticles do not behave as standard particles , but are more aptly interpreted as fractional numbers of massless particles  @xcite or as collections of particles with a particular distribution of masses  @xcite .",
    "these results are valid if the couplings of unparticles to the standard model are all non - renormalizable . if unparticle couplings include the super - renormalizable operator @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the standard model higgs boson , electroweak symmetry breaking breaks conformal invariance  @xcite .",
    "this modifies the unparticle propagator and implies that unparticle physics may be probed only in a narrow conformal window , typically at energies between 10 gev and 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "such energies are best probed at high energy colliders , and many studies have investigated the collider implications of unparticles  @xcite .",
    "models with conformal breaking may also share characteristics with hidden valley models  @xcite .    here",
    "we study a qualitatively new effect :  unparticle self - interactions .",
    "such 3- and higher - point interactions are always present in conformal theories , and mediate processes such as @xmath13 , with two or more unparticles in the final state . in the most interesting cases with",
    "strongly - coupled conformal sectors , the creation of additional high @xmath14 unparticles in the final state does not suppress the rate .",
    "multi-@xmath15 production therefore differs from all known examples , such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the rate is reduced with the addition of every high @xmath14 particle .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on 3-point self - interactions .",
    "these are the natural starting point for several reasons .",
    "first , unlike 4- and higher - point self - interactions , 3-point interactions are completely constrained by conformal invariance , up to a constant .",
    "second , 3-point interactions are the leading order at which induced signals may be nearly background free . for example , although the @xmath15 propagator induces signals like @xmath18 , 3-point @xmath15 self - interactions mediate @xmath19 , and many other spectacular signals through subprocesses such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4gamma_feynmandiagram ] . for this reason ,",
    "the most promising signals for unparticle discovery at colliders may in fact be those that are induced by 3-point unparticle interactions .",
    "( note that , although the production of 3 or more unparticles may also be unsuppressed , the requirement that they convert back to standard model particles to be visible does , in fact , imply that these are sub - dominant . )    in the following sections , we start from the 3-point correlation function in position space and convert it to a form useful for feynman diagram calculations .",
    "we then calculate collider rates , taking the @xmath20 signal as our example .",
    "our final result is determined up to the constant entering the 3-point correlation function . as far as we know , there is no theoretical upper bound on this constant  it is bounded only by current experimental constraints . applying these constraints , we find that the prospects for signals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are truly spectacular  the four - body final states given above may have cross sections of picobarns or larger , leading to obvious signals visible in the first year of the lhc .",
    "we also determine the predicted kinematic distributions from unparticles , which are insensitive to overall rates .",
    "these distributions provide testable predictions that could be used to distinguish multi - unparticle production from other possibilities for new physics .",
    "we begin by assuming that the standard model is coupled to the unparticle sector through a scalar operator @xmath7 . for a scalar , unitarity requires dimension @xmath21 , but there is no upper bound  @xcite . motivated by prominent supersymmetric examples  @xcite , we consider the range @xmath22 .",
    "modifications are required for vector and tensor operators  @xcite , but we expect that our primary conclusions apply to these cases as well .",
    "conformal invariance constrains the 3-point @xmath7 correlation function to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant determined by the unparticle self - coupling strength . in momentum space , it is then @xmath25 \\ ,     \\frac{1}{|z|^d \\ , |x|^d \\ , |y|^d}\\ ,   e^{i p_1 \\cdot x}\\ ,     e^{i p_2 \\cdot y } \\nonumber \\\\     & = & c'_d \\int \\frac{d^4 q}{(2 \\pi)^4 } \\ , \\int d^4 x\\ , d^4     y\\ , d^4 z\\ ,     \\frac{e^{i q \\cdot [ z - ( x - y)]}\\ , e^{i p_1 \\cdot x}\\ , e^{i p_2 \\cdot y } }     { |z|^d\\ , |x|^d\\ , |y|^d } \\nonumber \\\\     & = & c_d \\int \\frac{d^4 q}{(2 \\pi)^4}\\ ,     [ -q^2 - i \\epsilon]^{\\frac{d}{2 } - 2}\\ ,     [ -(p_1 - q)^2 - i \\epsilon]^{\\frac{d}{2 } - 2}\\ ,     [ -(p_2 + q)^2 - i \\epsilon]^{\\frac{d}{2 } - 2}\\ , , \\label{3point_correlation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality makes use of the unparticle 2-point correlation function  @xcite",
    ". @xmath26 is determined in terms of @xmath27 ; we choose to express our results in terms of @xmath26 .",

    "<S> in unparticle physics , operators of the conformal sector have self - interactions , and these are unsuppressed for strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-point interactions are completely determined by conformal symmetry , up to a constant . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know of any theoretical upper bounds on this constant . imposing current experimental constraints , we find that these interactions mediate spectacular collider signals , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , with cross sections of picobarns or larger at the large hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> self - interactions may therefore provide the leading discovery prospects for unparticle physics . </S>"
