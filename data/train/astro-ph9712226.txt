    "magnetic cataclysmic variables ( polars or am her stars ) are binary systems where a magnetised ( @xmath3 g ) white dwarf accretes from a low mass companion ( see e.g. the review by cropper 1990 ) .",
    "such magnetic fields are strong enough to disrupt disk formation . instead",
    ", the accreting stream is entrained by the magnetic field and falls freely through the gravitational potential until it hits the white dwarf surface .",
    "the resultant strong shock has a typical temperature of tens of kev for optically thin material , giving rise to an x  ray emitting plasma .",
    "normally such systems are locked into synchronous rotation by the magnetic field , so that ( to zeroth order ) the stream impacts onto the same part of the magnetosphere . however , there are now three systems known where the orbital period and white dwarf spin period are slightly different , by cam , v1500 cyg and rxj 1940.2 - 1025 ( e.g. watson et al 1995 ) , so that the accretion geometry changes continuously .",
    "recent progress in understanding the detailed shape of the x  ray emission has concentrated on the effects of reprocessing of the hard x  ray emission .",
    "inclusion of the effect of compton reflection from the white dwarf surface _ and _ complex absorption from the accreting material _ and _ the multi  temperature shock structure are necessary ingredients in the spectral model .",
    "while the importance of any one or two of these individual effects have long been recognised ( e.g. imamura & durisen 1983  absorption and shock structure ; swank , fabian & ross 1984 ; beardmore et al 1995  absorption and reflection ) all three are necessary in order to obtain a self  consistent description of the observed x  ray emission ( done et al 1995 ; cropper et al 1997 ) . both the complex absorption and compton reflection",
    "harden the spectrum , leading to an overestimate of the plasma temperature .",
    "the line emission from the hot plasma gives another independent measure of the plasma temperature , from the ratio of 6.7 and 6.9 kev lines from he and h  like iron , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the line emitting material is then lower than that inferred from the observed continuum .",
    "this discrepancy is exacerbated in detectors of low energy resolution as compton reflection produces a fluorescence iron line at 6.4 kev from the ( nearly neutral ) x  ray illuminated white dwarf surface , which is then blended by the instrument with the 6.7 and 6.9 kev lines .",
    "this reduces the mean iron line energy and leads to an underestimate of the plasma temperature .",
    "this systematic mismatch between ` observed ' line and continuum temperatures is particularly evident in the large sample of ginga ( low spectral resolution ) x  ray spectra of polars ( ishida 1991 ) , even after the inclusion of complex absorption .",
    "both complex absorption _ and _ compton reflection are required to obtain consistent temperatures from the line and continuum data ( beardmore et al 1995 ; done et al 1995 ) , but then the derived temperature is of order 10 kev , much lower than the expected rankine  hugoniot temperature for a strong shock of @xmath4 kev ( e.g. frank , king & raine 1992 , imamura et al 1997 ) . using multi ",
    "temperature shock models rather than assuming a single temperature plasma goes some way to resolving this , as the mean temperature of a @xmath5 kev multi  temperature shock structure is @xmath6 kev ( imamura & durisen 1983 ; done et al 1995 ; wu , chanagen & shaviv 1995 ; cropper et al 1997 ) .",
    "cyclotron cooling of the hottest / least dense material probably accounts for any remaining temperature discrepancy ( wu et al . , 1995 ; woelk & beuermann 1996 ) .",
    "while much real progress has been made , problems still remain .",
    "the most pressing of these have to do with the pre  shock accretion column .",
    "this material is irradiated by the x  ray emission , so should have a complex ionization structure ( see e.g. ross & fabian 1980 ; swank et al 1984 ; kallman et al 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "it is also spatially extended over the x  ray source so that different segments of the x  ray emission travel through different path lengths of the material ( done et al 1995 ) , especially as the accretion column is probably arc  like in cross - section , rather than circular ( e.g. cropper 1990 ) . the column should also add further complexity from secondary emission ( kallman et al 1993 , 1996 ) and scattering ( ishida et al 1997 ) .",
    "models including all these effects are currently being developed ( rainger et al 1997 , in preparation ) , but the situation is clearly complex .",
    "even more degrees of freedom are possible in the models : the material in the column is probably highly inhomogeneous , as dense ribbons of material embedded in a much less dense medium are required in order to explain the soft x  ray excess seen in several of these objects ( e.g. kuijpers & pringle 1982 ; frank , king & lasota 1988 ; ramsay et al . , 1994 ) .    by cam has been extensively studied by previous x  ray instruments , and its spectrum shows many of the temperature discrepancies discussed above .",
    "kallman et al ( 1993 , 1996 ) propose an explanation for these in terms of secondary emission from the column , producing an additional source of ionised 6.7 kev iron line emission .",
    "here we reanalyse the ginga and asca data from by cam and show that the spectrum is well described by the absorption / reflection / multi  temperature shock picture developed above , and that the contribution of the pre  shock material to the iron k line emission is probably negligible .",
    "the ginga data were taken in 1988 february 710 , with background observations taken directly before and after this .",
    "however , the second background could not be used as the rosat all sky survey bright source catalog gives 3 sources within 35 arcmin of the pointing position with total flux 1/5 of that from by cam itself .",
    "the first background alone is not sufficiently long to sample all the background conditions seen during the source observation so we exclude those parts of the source data which are not well matched by the background observation .",
    "standard selection and cleaning criteria were then applied to both source and background data , and the data were attitude corrected after a local background subtraction ( hayashida et al 1989 ; williams et al 1992 ) , resulting in 46 ks of data .",
    "ishida et al ( 1991 ) describes the time variability of the source during these observations .",
    "clear ( though generally partial ) eclipses are seen in the first half of the dataset , but are absent in the second half .",
    "this is explained as a transition in the accretion geometry from a two pole state , where only one of the accretion regions is periodically eclipsed by the white dwarf surface , to a state where the accretion only takes place onto the non  eclipsing pole ( see also silber et al 1992 ) .",
    "we split the data into 3 spectra as in ishida et al ( 1991 ) , namely pulse high and pulse low ( double pole accretion with the eclipsing pole oriented towards and away from the observer respectively ) and flaring ( accretion onto a single non - eclipsing pole ) .",
    "the asca data taken on 1994 march 10 - 11 observations and were previously reported by kallman et al .  ( 1996 ) .",
    "ftools 3.6 was used to generate standard response and arf files .",
    "the sis event files were screened in bright2 mode with 1024-binning .",
    "the gis3 data had to be binned onto 128 channels as the data were taken during the time when the onboard cpu mode was wrongly set .",
    "this resulted in a total exposure time of 22000 seconds and total count rate of 3.4 counts per second over the four detectors after the standard reduction .",
    "the data were accumulated into one single spectrum as kallman et al ( 1996 ) show no obvious hardness ratio changes .",
    "we restricted the energy range to 0.6 - 10 kev for sis data and 0.8 - 10 kev for gis data , and rebinned to have at least 20 counts per bin as required for validity of the @xmath7 statistic .",
    "the relative normalization of the detectors was within 10 % from our preliminary analysis , thus we fitted all the spectra as a single data group .",
    "kallman et al ( 1996 ) show the data folded on the polarization period of mason , liebert & schmidt ( 1989 ) with arbitrary phase .",
    "the orbital coverage is @xmath8% complete , and shows no evidence for an eclipse .",
    "the gaps in phase coverage are in two segments , each of width @xmath9 in phase .",
    "the ginga eclipse in the pulse state has width @xmath10 in phase ( ishida et al 1991 ) , so it seems unlikely that the asca data could have avoided the eclipse altogether .",
    "the lack of any convincing ingress / egress in the asca data then support ( although they can not confirm ) the view that the accretion geometry in by cam at the time of the asca observation was analogous to that of the ginga flaring state data .",
    "version 9.1 of xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) is used to fit the spectra .",
    "the mekal code is used to model a single temperature hot plasma , while a modified version of the cevmkl code ( see done & osborne 1997 ) is used for the multi  temperature plasma models which uses morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) abundance ratios .",
    "this gives a spectrum @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the bremstrahlung spectral emissivity at a given density @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 while @xmath15 is the total ( frequency integrated ) emissivity ( see also done et al 1995 ) .",
    "models with @xmath16 give a spectrum where each temperature component is weighted by its cooling time , i.e. the spectrum expected from pure bremsstrahlung cooling at constant pressure and gravitational field ( see the discussion in done et al 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the reflection code is described in done et al ( 1995 , 1997 ) , and here we assume a fixed inclination angle to the reflector of @xmath17 . error ranges are given as @xmath18 unless otherwise stated , although this is an underestimate of the true 90% confidence limits where parameters are correlated .",
    "single temperature plasma models , where the abundances of all the elements heavier than he are assumed to scale together , give fairly good fit , with @xmath19 , but the minimum temperature of @xmath20 kev shows that the continuum is much harder than can plausibly be expected for optically thin accretion onto a white dwarf .",
    "inclusion of an @xmath16 multi  temperature continuum model does not significantly improve the fit ( @xmath21 ) , and the derived ( maximum ) temperature is even higher , with @xmath22 kev , as the multi  temperature spectrum includes the softer cooling components .",
    "clearly there is some distortion present that is hardening the observed spectrum in the asca bandpass .",
    "absorption is the most obvious way to do this since compton reflection only contributes significantly to the spectrum above 5 kev , so is unlikely to strongly affect the asca data .",
    "simple absorption ( complete covering by neutral material ) is already included in the fit , so we try partial covering by neutral material . ishida ( 1991 ) shows that such complex absorption is not uncommon in polars , and uses this model to fit the ginga data of by cam ( ishida et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "this gives a significantly better fit for the multi ",
    "temperature @xmath16 plasma model , with @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 but still results in a physically unreasonable maximum shock temperature of @xmath27 kev",
    ". a more realistic shock temperature of @xmath28 kev can be obtained with the single temperature plasma model with @xmath29 @xmath25 and @xmath30 , but at the expense of physical consistency ( we expect multi  temperature components to be present ) and goodness of fit ( @xmath31 ) .    the asca data extend to substantially lower energies than can be studied with ginga , and so are more sensitive to the form of the absorber .",
    "a partial covering model is an _",
    "ad hoc _ description of what is expected to be a much more complex situation .",
    "a power law distribution of column with covering fraction i.e. @xmath32 ( see also norton , watson & king 1991 ) gives a good approximation to the complex absorption expected through neutral material extended over the source ( e.g. done et al 1995 ) .",
    "the sum of covering fractions must be unity so that the emergent spectrum @xmath33 is related to the intrinsic spectrum @xmath34 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the photo  electric absorption cross ",
    "section from morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) abundances as given by the wabs model in xspec .",
    "we fix @xmath38 @xmath25 , and figure 1 shows the transmitted fraction as a function of energy for @xmath39 @xmath25 with @xmath40 ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 . for comparison",
    "we also show the transmitted fraction obtained by the circular column model of done et al ( 1995 ) for a mid column of @xmath43 @xmath25 ( and hence a maximum column of @xmath44 @xmath25 ) , and that obtained from complete covering by a column of @xmath43 @xmath25 .",
    "the power law absorption model gives a smooth hardening of the spectrum which matches the data significantly better ( @xmath45 ) than the partial covering model .",
    "the derived maximum temperature of a multi  temperature plasma is then the more physically reasonable @xmath46 kev for a maximum column of @xmath47 @xmath25 , with index @xmath48 .",
    "figure 2 shows the data and residuals for this model , along with the intrinsic spectrum before the absorption .",
    "alternatively , the material may be ionized due to the intense irradiation of the pre ",
    "shock column by the x  ray emitting plasma .",
    "we use the xspec model absori to approximate this , fixing the power law temperature of the illuminated material to @xmath49 k and approximating the x  ray spectrum by a power law of photon index @xmath50 . complete covering by a ionized material gives a worse description of the data , with @xmath51 for a column of @xmath52 @xmath25 at an ionization parameter of @xmath53 , and again with an unphysically high temperature for the @xmath16 plasma of @xmath54 kev .",
    "such models have been used above 2 kev to match the complex absorption seen in the data ( beardmore et al 1995 ; cropper et al 1997 ) , but they predict a large oxygen edge which is inconsistent with the observed spectra below 1 kev .    to summarise the results so far",
    ", the data strongly require heavy absorption , which significantly hardens the spectrum below 3 kev , but this absorption is complex .",
    "complete covering of the source by a screen of material in a single ionization state ( neutral or ionised ) is strongly ruled out . instead",
    "the absorption can be described as a continuous range of columns through which the source is seen , as expected for the pre - shock material . while the ionization structure of the column is outside of the scope of this paper ( see rainger et al 1997 ) , the data are clearly consistent with a power law column ",
    "covering fraction distribution of neutral material , so we use this model in all the following fits .",
    "the continuum is also significantly better described by a multi ",
    "temperature @xmath16 cooling shock model than by a single temperature plasma , so we use this to describe the plasma emission in all the following fits .",
    "while the resultant fit is statistically adequate , there are clear residuals left around the iron k line ( see figure 2 ) . adding a narrow gaussian line gives a reduction in @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( significant at greater than @xmath57 % confidence ) for @xmath58 kev and equivalent width @xmath59 ev .",
    "this additional line component is _ inconsistent _ with being at 6.7 kev , as postulated by kallman et al .",
    "a ( nearly ) neutral iron fluorescence line is expected from reflection of the intrinsic spectrum from the white dwarf surface . fixing the line energy at 6.4 kev and including a neutral compton reflection continuum that must accompany any reflected line emission leads to @xmath60 , for an amount of reflection @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 denotes the normalisation of the reflected continuuum expected from an isotropically illuminated slab covering a solid angle of @xmath63 ) assuming the abundances in the reflector are the same as those in the hot plasma , with maximum temperature @xmath64 kev . while the detection of the reflected continuum is only marginally significant",
    ", its level is consistent with that expected from the strength of the cold iron fluorescence line .",
    "the line equivalent width and amount of reflection continuum are anti  correlated in the fitting , so a self consistent reflection model ( including both line and continuum ) would be much better constrained .",
    "this fit is detailed in table 1 , and shown in figure 3 .",
    "the abundances of the elements in the hot plasma need not all scale together , especially as by cam is proposed to have abundance anomalies to explain the enhanced nv line emission observed in its uv spectrum ( bonnet  bidaud & mouchet 1987 ) .",
    "the n x  ray lines are below the 0.6 kev well calibrated low energy limit of the asca detectors , but can be investigated by including the less reliable data down to 0.4 kev .",
    "the soft excess is then also apparent ( kallman et al 1996 ) , so a blackbody is needed to model this . the derived limit on the n abundance is then @xmath65 solar , which is not restrictive .",
    "going back to the standard bandpass , the strongest lines expected at these plasma temperatures are fe , si , s and o. letting the abundances of all these be free gives @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 , i.e. there is no significant improvement in the fit as the inclusion of 4 extra free parameters gives a reduction of only @xmath72 .",
    "thus there is no strong evidence for non  solar abundance _",
    "ratios _ of the elements , although o is marginally lower than expected .    the intrinsic multi  temperature plasma emission can also be investigated in more detail .",
    "we have so far assumed that the plasma cools from the shock temperature to the white dwarf photosphere at @xmath73 k @xmath74 ev , and that all these cooler components contribute to the spectrum . however , this is not necessarily the case since the cooling plasma may be dense enough to become optically thick , so giving an apparent minimum temperature to the cooling radiation which is rather higher than that of the white dwarf .",
    "we modify the plasma emission model to include the minimum temperature as a free parameter of the fit , and find that this converges to an identical fit as before , with @xmath75 ev .",
    "the limits on the o abundance are also unchanged , with @xmath69 ( @xmath76 ) , showing that incomplete cooling is not responsible for any potential deficit of o line emission .    similarly , the temperature distribution need not be given by the @xmath16 power law model expected from pure x  ray line and continuum cooling as the assumptions of bremsstrahlung only cooling at constant pressure and gravitational field may not be accurate . letting @xmath77 be free",
    "gives a significant decrease in @xmath55 to @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 kev .",
    "thus the data are consistent with multi  temperature emission from complete cooling behind the shock , where the accreting material is @xmath81 solar abundance in all the elements .",
    "this intrinsic spectrum is then modified by reflection from the white dwarf surface , producing both reflected continuum and associated 6.4 kev iron fluorescence line , and further distorted by complex absorption .",
    "the intrinsic emission is required to be a multi  temperature plasma , and the cooling components are significantly detected in the data .",
    "parameters for both the expected @xmath16 cooling model and the better fitting model where @xmath77 is free are given in table 1 .",
    "the best fit single temperature model ( including reflection and complex absorption ) is also tabulated for comparison , but is a worse fit by @xmath82 as the data contain significant iron l line emission which can not be fit by the single temperature models .",
    "this is the first observational confirmation of the theoretically expected cooling of the shocked plasma in polars , although the distribution of cool components with temperature is marginally inconsistent with the predicted @xmath16 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the complex absorption is clearly a major component in the spectrum , giving a smooth hardening at energies lower than @xmath83 kev which can not be described by complete covering by material of a single ionization parameter .",
    "the lack of the standard absorption signatures ( strong low energy cutoff or ionised edges ) means that it is not always obvious that this component is present in the spectrum . in by cam its main signature",
    "is that the derived temperature for the asca spectrum becomes unphysically high without it .",
    "we caution that where this complex absorption is present , the observed bremsstrahlung luminosity can be severely underestimated in spectra which only extend to 23 kev ( e.g. rosat ; ramsay et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "our model for this absorption is one in which neutral material with a range of covering fractions obscures the source , so that @xmath84 .",
    "the simplest geometry of a cylindrical neutral column overlaying a circular source predicts a distribution of column with covering fraction such that @xmath85 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this is very different from the observed @xmath86 , indicating that the situation is ( unsurprisingly ) much more complex .",
    "the absorption can only be constrained by the asca data which is phase averaged , so some of the discrepancy in expected column distribution could arise from co  adding data .",
    "further distortions could also be produced if the accretion column is ionised .",
    "this would have the effect of making the absorption from a circular column less dramatic than predicted from neutral material , as required by the @xmath86 distribution .",
    "ionization of a uniform accretion column has long been known to be likely ( ross & fabian 1980 ; swank , fabian & ross 1984 ) but is much less probable if the column has a highly inhomogeneous blobby structure ( e.g. frank , king & lasota 1988 ) . in this case radial structure can alter the observed properties",
    ". the observed @xmath86 distribution can be reproduced by a model in which neutral blobs accrete preferentially towards the centre of the column , with blob density @xmath87 , so that the much less of the x  ray source is covered by the highest column density material ( dash  dotted line in figure 1 ) .",
    "all accretion column models predict a substantial change in absorption with phase . for a neutral , constant density column",
    ", there should be much less absorption when the hard x  ray emission region is on the limb of the white dwarf ( pulse low state ) than when it is viewed more directly ( pulse high ) as the mean path length through the accretion column is smaller ( done et al 1995 ) .",
    "allowing for ionization enhances this effect , as the high ionization material ( and hence weakest absorption ) is produced in the layers closest to the shock .",
    "the ginga data are indeed consistent with a change in absorption between low and high state , in the sense that the low state is less absorbed ( see table 2 ) , but a complete model of the density and ionization structure of the photo  ionised column to determine both its absorption and emission properties is clearly needed before such ideas can be properly tested .",
    "the absorption is also presumably linked to the mass accretion rate , as there is more material in the column at high mass accretion rates .",
    "thus for a neutral column we expect that the absorption should correlate with x  ray luminosity .",
    "by contrast , an ionised column may show absorption anti  correlated with luminosity as the bremsstrahlung intensity is @xmath88 while the column density is only @xmath89 . again",
    ", proper modelling of the column is required in order to determine the observational consequences of this , and better data are required to test whether the absorber is predominantly ionised or neutral .",
    "a single temperature plasma continuum is clearly ruled out by the asca data .",
    "temperature plasma is expected physically , as the hot shocked gas must cool as it emits x - ray radiation .",
    "the observational signature of this is that the spectra show significant emission both from the h and he  like k@xmath77 lines at 6.9 and 6.7 kev and iron l shell lines around 1 kev from much lower ionization species . for all of these different fe ion states to co  exist requires a multi  temperature plasma .",
    "the observed maximum x  ray temperature of @xmath90 kev ( from the better constrained ginga fits ) is rather lower than the @xmath91 kev expected from a pure bremsstrahlung shock above a solar mass white dwarf .",
    "taken at face value this would limit the mass of the white dwarf to @xmath92",
    ". however , by cam has a substantial magnetic field of @xmath93 mg ( schwope 1996 revised from the cropper et al 1989 value of 40.8 mg ) , so cyclotron cooling may be important .",
    "the high temperature / low density material close to the shock preferentially cools via cyclotron ( emissivity @xmath94 : wu et al 1995 ) while at lower temperatures / higher densities the bremsstrahlung ( emissivity @xmath95 ) becomes more important .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the maximum x  ray bremsstrahlung temperature below that expected from a simple strong shock ( wu et al 1995 ; woelk & beuermann 1996 ) .",
    "composite cyclotron ",
    "bremsstrahlung cooling shocks also have another feature not seen in pure bremsstrahlung shocks , namely that the maximum x  ray temperature _ changes _ as a function of mass accretion rate .",
    "higher mass accretion rates increase the density of the shocked material , and so shift the balance between cyclotron and bremsstrahlung cooling in favour of bremsstrahlung ( woelk & beuermann 1996 , wu et al 1995 ) .",
    "thus we expect the maximum shock temperature as seen from the x  ray emission to increase with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "we use the code of wu et al ( 1995 ) to calculate the temperature at which bremsstrahlung and cyclotron cooling are equal for @xmath96 mg , @xmath97 and mass accretion rate of @xmath98 and @xmath99 g s@xmath100 ( corresponding to luminosity of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ergs s@xmath100 , respectively ) .",
    "this gives @xmath103 and @xmath104 kev .",
    "these are intruigingly close to the best fit derived maximum temperatures for the @xmath16 ginga and asca data of @xmath105 and @xmath106 kev , respectively , for a factor of @xmath107 difference in mean 210 kev count rate . while the large error bars mean that the effect is not significant here , these temperature changes should be seen in high quality , broad bandpass spectra from sax and/or xte    cyclotron cooling",
    "has a strong and variable effect in suppressing the high temperature x  ray emission .",
    "these by cam data stress again the point made by wu et al ( 1995 ) and woelk & beuermann ( 1996 ) that equating the maximum bremsstrahlung temperature to the shock temperature is _ not _ a good guide to the white dwarf mass .",
    "however , downstream from the shock , once the density and temperature are such that bremsstrahlung dominates the cooling then the shock structure is again given by the standard bremsstrahlung @xmath16 cooling .",
    "this can be seen from the results of the code of wu et al ( 1995 ) and also theoretically , since when bremsstralung cooling dominates all the equations are the same as for a bremsstralung only shock .",
    "the derived temperature distribution seen in the asca data is ( marginally ) significantly different from this , with @xmath108 i.e. more cool components than expected .",
    "this may be an artifact of the _ ad hoc _ absorption model used ( see above ) .",
    "if the real absorber includes complex contributions from ionised material then some structure should be present at the oviii k and fe l line and edge energies which may distort the derived continuum .",
    "alternatively , this may be a real effect , showing that the shock structure deviates significantly from that expected , perhaps due to conduction and/or compton cooling ( imamura & durisen 1983 ; imamura et al 1987 ) .",
    "the x  ray line emission from by cam is weaker than expected from solar abundance ( morrison and mccammon 1983 ) coronal models .",
    "this has been seen systematically from many classes of objects , including stellar coronae ( see e.g. guedel et al 1997 ; mewe et al 1997 ) as well as other cataclysmic variables ( done et al 1995 ; done & osborne 1997 ) . while deviations from coronal equilibrium may be expected , none of these seem able to produce the observed weak lines ( done et al 1995 , done and osborne 1997 ) , so it seems more likely that this represents a true under - abundance with respect to solar .",
    "this seems more plausible now that optical studies suggest stars in the solar neighbourhood have considerable dispersion in metallicity , and that the mean [ fe / h ] is 0.25 - 0.3 dex _ lower _ than that of the sun ( edvardsson et al 1993 ) , but is still an uncomfortable conclusion .",
    "strong uv lines from nv have led to a claim that the n abundance is enhanced ( bonnet  bidaud & mouchet 1987 ) .",
    "x  ray line strengths from h and he  like ions give much less ambiguous determinations of abundances than uv or optical photo  ionised lines , but the x  ray n lines are below the well calibrated energy limit of the detector and the derived limit of @xmath109 solar is not restrictive . whether or not n is indeed enhanced , the suggested explanation of a recent novae explosion as the cause ( bonnet  bidaud & mouchet 1987 ) seems unlikely since the lines arise from the accretion stream i.e. material from the _ secondary _ star . even if the secondary did manage to capture some fraction of the nuclear processed material",
    ", the elemental abundance anomalies would become diluted by mixing with the un  reprocessed material in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "however , recent hst spectra of the surface layers of the accreting white dwarf in vw hydri also seem to show abundance anomalies , with al@xmath110 solar , and p@xmath111 solar ( sion et al 1997 ) !",
    "again , these have been interpreted as being indicative of a recent novae , so we examine other possible x  ray signatures of nuclear reprocessing in by cam .",
    "the core composition of the accreting white dwarf can either be co or onemg . for a co white dwarf ,",
    "calculations by kovetz & prialnik ( 1997 ) show that while n is almost always enhanced in a nova explosion , the o abundance can be almost unaffected or strongly depleted , while the heavier elements are not substantially enriched .",
    "this is consistent with the asca observations .",
    "conversely , for an onemg white dwarf core , n / o@xmath112 requires that the abundances of p and s should also be strongly enhanced ( politano et al 1995 ) .",
    "this type of nova explosion can then be clearly ruled out since s is not overabundant ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "thus if a recent novae has enriched the n abundance , it would have to be from accretion onto a co core , although a more likely explanation for anomalous c / n ratios is that the secondary is evolved ( mouchet et al 1997 ) .",
    "physically motivated ( as opposed to phenomolgical ) descriptions of the spectrum of by cam are given by kallman et al ( 1996 ) , using the same asca data as studied here .",
    "however , their conclusions are rather different in that they propose a strong _ line emission _ component at 6.7 kev from the pre  shock column , rather than absorption .",
    "they require this because their assumed continuum form ( a 30 kev bremsstrahlung ) produces copious 6.9 kev line from h  like iron , but has a low he  like iron ion fraction , so can not produce much of the observed 6.7 kev line .",
    "we show that this conclusion is obviated by using a continuum given by the ( physically expected ) multi  temperature plasma emission from a cooling shock , as this can produce both the 6.7 and 6.9 kev lines .",
    "kallman et al ( 1996 ) discount this possibility due to the weakness of the observed 6.9 kev line compared to that expected from lower temperature plasma with solar abundances .",
    "this objection is removed by allowing iron ( and the other element abundances ) to be sub ",
    "kallman et al ( 1996 ) also comment that with lower temperature plasma the observed continuum is too flat . in our analysis",
    "this is resolved by the inclusion of complex absorption from the column .",
    "we note that kallman et al ( 1996 ) require a pre  shock column of order @xmath113 @xmath25 overlaying the x  ray emission region .",
    "thus their model is not self  consistent as it does not take into account the strong absorption that this predicts .",
    "our model is also inconsistent in not including the _ emission _ from the x  ray illuminated column , but the sub  solar iron abundances means that any predicted iron k line emission is reduced by a factor 3 below that of kallman et al ( 1996 ) i.e. @xmath114 ev equivalent width , which is smaller than the error bars .",
    "the photo  ionised column is instead expected to produce the bulk of its emission from continuum / recombination continuum / lines at energies below @xmath115 kev , as noted by kallman et al ( 1993 ) where a large neutral absorption column is required to suppress the strong predicted low energy emission .    kallman et al ( 1996 ) also speculate on the presence of a reflection component to produce the observed 6.4 kev line .",
    "their derived limit of @xmath116 is again assuming solar abundances , without including the inclination effects , and using the results of early reflection calculations , which gave ew @xmath117 ev for a 20 kev bremsstrahlung illumination .",
    "more recent monte ",
    "carlo results ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 , matt , perola & piro 1991 , van teesling , kaastra & heise 1996 ) , scaled to a 20 kev bremsstrahlung continuum ( e.g. beardmore et al 1995 ) indicate that even for a face on , solar abundance slab the line emission is no more than @xmath118 ev , while for a mean ( phase averaged ) viewing angle of @xmath17 this reduces to @xmath119 ev , while abundances of @xmath120 solar reduces it further to @xmath121 ev ( george & fabian 1991 ) . thus the 6.4 kev line strength is easily consistent with reflection from a shock just above the white dwarf surface i.e. with @xmath122 .",
    "the by cam data from asca and ginga give a physically self consistent picture of an accretion column shock , cooling by both cyclotron and bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "this multi  temperature x  ray continuum illuminates the white dwarf surface , producing a reflection continuum and iron fluorescence line .",
    "absorption from the pre ",
    "shock column strongly modifies the observed spectral form , and is a significant source of uncertainty since it depends on whether the pre  shock column is uniform , or blobby ( and hence ionised or nearly neutral ) , circular or arc  like in cross  section and whether there is radial density structure .",
    "we model this absorption by neutral material where the covering fraction is a power law function of the column .",
    "this could represent a physical situation where the column is blobby ( unionised ) , with more blobs accreting towards the centre of a circular column .",
    "however , it is more likely that this form merely gives a suitable approximation to a more complex situation , and we urge further theoretical modelling of the pre  shock flow .",
    "the multi  temperature emission and reflection model , together with the power law neutral absorption model will be made publically available in the next release of xspec .",
