    "outflows of photo - ionised gas are ubiquitous in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "recent surveys with _ xmm - newton_and _ suzaku_by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter ` paper  i ' ) have shown that fek - shell outflows are observed in a significant fraction ( @xmath21 ) of active galaxies .",
    "these potentially massive outflows ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) , which are identified through blue - shifted resonant absorption from fexxv  he@xmath24(@xmath25kev ) and fexxvi  ly@xmath24(@xmath26kev ) , can posses outflow velocities ( @xmath27 ) ranging from a few thousand kms@xmath6 up to mildly relativistic values ( @xmath28c ; @xcite ) which indicates a substantial mass transport into the host galaxy .",
    "the large wind velocity  which indicates an origin directly associated with the accretion disk , hence leading them to be dubbed ` disk - winds '  implies that the ensuing outflow may be energetically significant in terms of feedback ( i.e. , @xmath29 , @xcite ) .",
    "the winds are observed in both radio - quiet ( @xcite , paper  i ) and radio - loud ( paper  i , @xcite ) agn which suggests that they may also be an important addition to the traditional agn unified model ( e.g. , ) .    in paper",
    "i we performed a systematic search for fek absorption in 51 _",
    "suzaku_-observed agn which were heterogeneously selected from the heasarc data archive ( see paper  i for selection criteria ) .",
    "our main results from that paper were : ( i ) blue - shifted fek - shell absorption is present at the @xmath30 level in 20/51 ( @xmath1 ) of the selected agn ( in 28/73 individual observations ) ; ( ii ) the absorbing gas is typified by mean values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while the outflow velocity spans a continuous range between @xmath33kms@xmath6 and @xmath34kms@xmath6 , respectively , with a mean and median velocity of @xmath35c and @xmath36c . ultimately , these results are all consistent with those found by @xcite on the basis of their _ xmm - newton_sample .    in this work ,",
    "we build upon our previous results to assess the properties of the disk - wind itself .",
    "the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows : in  [ sec : wind parameters ] we outline the equations through which assess the wind properties , in  [ sec : parameter_constraints ] we use the inferred values to perform a qualitative assessment of the wind properties , before going on to conduct a quantitative correlation analysis of how the various wind properties scale with the agn bolometric luminosity in  [ sec : correlation_analyses ] . in  [ sec : discussion ] we then compare our results to those already present in the literature , discuss the wind acceleration mechanism which may be responsible for the observed outflows , and finally assess whether the observed wind is likely to be energetically significant in terms of feedback .",
    "we summarise our results and present our overall conclusions in  [ sec : summary_conclusions ] .",

    "the mass outflow rate for an arbitrary wind is given by @xmath265 , where @xmath266 and @xmath267 are the density and velocity profile of the wind and @xmath268 is a factor which accounts for the geometry of the system . assuming that the flow has constant terminal velocity @xmath269 and that the absorbing gas has cosmic elemental abundances ( i.e. , @xmath270 of its mass by hydrogen and @xmath271 by helium ) , @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the proton mass and @xmath153 is the electron number density of the plasma . for a thin spherically symmetric isotropic wind @xmath274 , where the product @xmath275 is known as the _ global filling factor _ and accounts for both the solid angle occupied by the flow ( @xmath276 ) and how much of the flow volume is filled by gas ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath278 where we have neglected the constant factor of order unity .",
    "the value @xmath277 is extremely difficult to determine because it depends on the ionisation and clumpiness of the gas . at low ",
    "intermediate ionisation states the flow is likely to be clumpy / filamentary , while at high ionisation states it can be considered largely smooth and of low density because the vast majority of elements are stripped of electrons . in the clumpy case",
    ", the column density of the wind can be given by @xmath279 , with @xmath280 implicitly allowing for inhomogeneities in the flow .",
    "alternatively , at high ionisation states @xmath281 and @xmath282 . substituting for @xmath283 and @xmath154 then leads to algebraic upper and lower limits on the mass outflow rate :    @xmath284    the major remaining uncertainty is the opening angle of the system @xmath276 . here",
    ", we adopt the average opening angle @xmath285 as inferred from the global detection fraction of fek winds reported in the literature ( @xmath286 ; @xcite , paper  1 ) .",
    "the assumption of a uniform wind geometry is clearly an oversimplification of real systems ; in reality , numerous factors such as source luminosity , gas density , etc . , will contribute to the shaping of an x - ray disk - wind and therefore the wind geometry is going to differ on an object - by - object basis .",
    "even so , we note that the average opening angle of @xmath285 is comparable to the wind opening measured from the p - cygni - like fek profile in pds456 ( @xmath276 is resolved to be @xmath287 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that it is a good approximation to the geometry of real disk - winds .",
    "provided that the wind has already reached a steady terminal velocity by the point at which it is observed , the mechanical power imparted by expelling mass at a rate @xmath13 with velocity @xmath27 is simply equal to its kinetic energy : @xmath288 .",
    "we determine the range of likely kinetic power by substituting for @xmath289 , leading to    @xmath290    similarly , the rate at which the outflow transports momentum into the environment of the host galaxy is given by @xmath291 .",

    ", this also means that the other lower limiting quantities in equations  ( [ eq : rmin ] ) , ( [ eq : moutmin ] ) , ( [ eq : kemin ] ) and ( [ eq : poutmin ] ) are also proportional to @xmath147 .",
    "estimates for @xmath147 gathered from the literature are collated in table  [ table : measured_wind_properties ] .",
    "we obtain most of the @xmath147 values through the numerous reverberation mapping studies available in the literature ( i.e. , @xcite ) which tend to offer relatively tight constraints on the mass of the central object ; in the cases where an agn had been subject to reverberation mapping multiple times , we adopt the most recent estimate on @xmath147 only .",
    "there are several empirically determined mass estimates for the bhs in 3c111 , eso103-g035 , ngc1365 , ngc5506 and pds456 . for these",
    "agn we report the mean value , with the associated errors taken as half of the range between the minimum and maximum values to account for the uncertainty in the individual estimates on @xmath147 . for cbs126 , where we were unable to find any robust mass estimates in the literature , we infer @xmath147 from the blr line width and luminosity scaling relation of @xcite using the appropriate spectral values listed in @xcite . for 3c390.3",

    "we take @xmath147 directly from the reference listed in the table footnote .",
    "the sample encompasses almost 6 orders of magnitude in black hole mass , with @xmath294 ranging from @xmath295 in the dwarf - seyfert galaxy ngc4395 ( @xcite ) , all the way up to an estimated @xmath296 in the high luminosity bal quasar apm08279 + 5255 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the bolometric luminosity for each agn : @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the unattenuated source luminosity integrated between @xmath299kev and @xmath300 is the bolometric correction factor .",
    "various studies have shown that the spread of @xmath300 amongst individual agn is quite large ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whilst the correction appropriate for a particular agn can be a function of luminosity ( @xcite ) , eddington ratio ( @xcite ) , or both ( @xcite ) , such that the uniform application of a single bolometric correction factor may be inappropriate for a heterogeneously selected sample .",
    "we therefore primarily use the @xmath300 values listed in the works of @xcite and @xcite which are empirically determined on the basis of the broad - band spectral energy distributions of each agn .",

    "several of the agn in the have fek absorption detected in multiple epochs ( see paper  i ) , such as is the case for 3c111 , mrk766 , ngc1365 , ngc3227 , ngc3783 , ngc4051 , or have more than one absorption trough which comprises a multi - velocity system ( pds456 and apm08279 + 5255 ) . for these agn considering the mean parameter value and accounting for intrinsic outflow variability between epochs by folding the uncertainties on each of the individual measurements into the error bar . in the majority of cases we find the individual measurements to be largely consistent within the errors , suggesting that the outflow is persistent across the different epochs . only in 3c111 ,",
    "mrk766 and ngc4051 do there appear to be significant differences at the 90% level ( see table  [ table : measured_wind_properties ] ) , and this is reflected in the broad error bars for these sources .",
    "for pds456 and apm08279 + 5255 , which both appear to have two fek absorption systems at different velocities , we adopt the mean velocity and again fold the range of possible velocities into the error bar .",
    "table  [ table : measured_wind_properties ] summarises the measured parameters of the winds detected in the _ suzaku_sample .",
    "using the values in table  [ table : measured_wind_properties ] we first computed the wind parameters in standard units and then normalised them to the appropriate values for a given black hole mass ; the resultant values are noted in tables  [ table : main_results ] and [ table : normalised_table ] , respectively.we normalised the specific parameters as follows : ( i ) the distance @xmath305 to units of schwarzchild radius @xmath306 , ( ii ) the kinetic luminosity @xmath307 to @xmath308 , ( iii ) the mass outflow rate @xmath309 to the eddington accretion rate @xmath310 ( assuming @xmath311 for the accretion efficiency ) , and ( iv ) the momentum rate to the eddington momentum rate @xmath312 .",
    "algebraically , this yields a set of 8 normalised equations :    @xmath313    errors on the normalised parameters were determined by both propagating the uncertainties on the measured xstarvalues through the various equations , and also taking into account the error on @xmath147 where applicable . for cbs126 , ngc1365 , ngc3227 , ngc3516 and ngc4395 , which all have relatively slow wind velocities of the order @xmath314c ( see table  [ table : measured_wind_properties ] ) , we found that @xmath315 ( within the errors ) which indicates that either : ( i ) the outflow may not have achieved the requisite escape speed for its observed location , in which case the wind material may not escape into the host galaxy unless it is subject to an additional acceleration mechanism once it has crossed the los , or ( ii ) that the wind steam line flows almost perpendicularly along the los such that we are only seeing the tangential component of @xmath27 . while the associated error bars in these slow sources may overlap ( suggesting that the upper and lower limits may be formally consistent ) we choose to only report the upper limiting quantities for these five agn in tables  [ table : main_results ] and [ table : normalised_table ] so that we do not introduce an artificially tight ( and potentially misleading ) constraint on the properties of the wind . in the remainder of our analysis we separate the outflow sample into two groups based on their velocity : those with @xmath316c ( @xmath317kms@xmath6 ) are hereafter classified as ` slow ' , whilst those with @xmath2c are ` fast ' . whilst the chosen velocity threshold is essentially arbitrary",

    "unfortunately , however , the relatively tight clustering in the data at @xmath576 , compounded by the lack of fek wind parameters in low eddington ratio sources ( i.e. , @xmath577 ) sources , meant that we were unable to discern any plausible relationships among the data .",
    "as a consistency check , we also checked for evidence of relationships amongst the raw @xmath578 values finding that the same correlations are still present in the data , albeit at lower significance level .",
    "the presence of the same correlations in both the contiguous @xmath578 and the non - simultaneous @xmath16 indicates that the correlations are not driven by uncertainties in @xmath300 .",
    "in paper  i we showed that @xmath1 of the agn in the _ suzaku_sample exhibit evidence for highly - ionised winds in their fek band .",
    "this is in agreement with the detection fraction reported by @xcite for _ xmm - newton _ , and corroborates their conclusion that such winds are either ( i ) persistent over the active phase and thus have a large covering fraction , or ( ii ) transient in nature and have a covering fraction of unity for only a fraction of the time .",
    "we also showed that the @xmath489 and @xmath490 distributions are also entirely consistent between the two samples , covering ranges of @xmath579 and @xmath580 in both , respectively , with the outflow velocity @xmath27 also being largely consistent on the basis of a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . by comparing the distributions of wind parameters found in this work to those determined by @xcite we similarly find that the fek absorbers detected in both the _ suzaku_and _ xmm - newton_studies are typified by the same range of physical parameters and occupy the same parameter space in terms of their overall location and energetics : @xmath581 ( @xmath582pc ) , @xmath583 ( @xmath584yr ) and @xmath585 .",
    "their medians are also similar with @xmath586 , @xmath587 and @xmath588 for _ suzaku_(_xmm - newton _ ) , respectively , in natural units .",
    "the _ suzaku_outflow sample therefore robustly confirms that fek absorption are a real physical component of emergent x - ray spectrum , that the implied winds likely have a large covering fraction , and that they are typified by large column densities and high ionisation .",
    "the range of outflow velocities , which are typically @xmath589 , but can be as low as @xmath590 in some cases , also suggests that the highly - ionised winds share an overlap in velocity space with the traditional soft x - ray warm absorber .",
    "this is in line with the results of @xcite who argue that some of the soft x - ray warm absorbers could be the artefacts of accretion disc winds which have propagated farther away from the smbh .",
    "another interesting study that we can consider is that of @xcite , who compare the kinetic power of both the warm absorber and relativistic jets to @xmath16 of their respective source .",
    "they consider both black - hole binaries ( bhbs ) and agn which means that their study samples an extremely broad spectrum of both black hole mass @xmath591 $ ] and bolometric luminosity [ @xmath592 .",
    "even though the @xcite study deals primarily with the low - velocity soft x - ray warm absorber they do include a few ` ultra - fast outflows ' ( which they define as those with @xmath593c , as we have done in this work ) as a matter of comparison , although they do not fit them directly as part of their regression analysis ; two of their ` ultra - fast ' sources , namely 3c111 and apm08279 + 5255 , are also included in our _ suzaku_sample . in principle",
    "we could compare the properties of the _ suzaku_-detected outflows with those of king et al . to determine if our high velocity fek winds scale in a similar manner to the warm - absorber .",
    "however , this is not possible in practice because the two studies compute the wind kinetic power according to different assumptions ( king et al .",
    "give their quantities in units of per - covering - fraction ) , which means the intercept of any linear regressions will therefore by intrinsically offset .",
    "even so , the _ slope _ of any linear fit  which is the important parameter as it measures how the kinetic power varies with bolometric luminosity  can still be compared because it is largely independent of the normalisation .",
    "king et al .",
    "find the kinetic power of warm absorber to be strongly correlated with @xmath16 , scaling with a tight global slope of @xmath594 , while they found that those in agn have a much flatter local slope of @xmath595 when considered in isolation ( although that this could be driven by there being a smaller number of agn ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : lbol_raw]d we showed that kinetic power of the _ suzaku_-detected fek winds are also strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity with a slope in the range @xmath516 ( @xmath596 ) .",
    "this result , which is driven by the @xmath597 dependence , is in good agreement with the slope reported by king et al . for their global sample and suggests that the fast fek winds may scale with @xmath16 in a similar manner to the warm absorber .",
    "to summarise , by comparing our results for those obtained by @xcite we see that the fast fek winds ( @xmath2c ) is similar to that found for slow warm absorbers .      in this work",
    "we shown that the observed wind velocity , and subsequently the overall wind energetics , are proportional to the agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude that the winds are accelerated by radiation pressure . in this section",
    "we investigate whether radiation pressure alone can account for the observed correlations .",
    "in contrast to the undoubtedly line - driven winds which are prevalent in the uv spectra of agn , the high ionisation state of the fek winds suggests that line - driving is unlikely to be the dominant acceleration mechanism here .",
    "an alternative means of radiatively accelerating high ionisation gas is through thomson / compton scattering of the continuum x - ray photons . while line - driving may play a role in large black holes accreting near the eddington limit ( hagino et al .",
    "2014 , in prep ) we concentrate on the latter mechanism here .    in comparison to fast line - driven winds in the uv , the comparatively small interaction cross - section in highly ionised material means that high - ionisation winds , such as those considered here , couple much less efficiently with the incident radiation and , as a result , require either much larger source luminosities or higher column densities to achieve equivalent outflow velocities . a general characteristic of these ` continuum - driven winds ' is that they are accelerated by photons scattering off free electrons in the absorbing gas which transfers a portion of the photon momentum to the material , hence causing a wind .",
    "this scenario has been considered extensively in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we outline the general theory again here in an effort to search for relevant relationships with @xmath16 which we can relate to the results of our regression analysis .",
    "the efficiency through which the photon momentum of the incident radiation field is transferred into the wind depends upon the plasmas optical depth to electron scattering , @xmath598 , which determines how many times each electron is likely to scatter in the flow .",
    "the total electron scattering optical depth of a homogeneous wind viewed from infinity down to radius @xmath159 is given by @xmath599 where @xmath600 is the thomson cross - section for electron - scattering , @xmath601 is the electron number density in a mass - conserving spherical flow ( c.f .",
    ",  [ sub : mass_outflow_rate ] ) and @xmath277 is a geometrical factor which takes into account the global covering of the gas .",
    "normalising to the eddington mass - accretion rate , @xmath602 , then yields @xmath603 as has been shown by @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "if we further assume that the measured flow velocity roughly corresponds to the escape velocity at the radius where the wind was launched , i.e. , @xmath604 , we have @xmath605 which , after substituting for @xmath310 and re - arranging , becomes @xmath606 where @xmath607 , the geometric factor @xmath608 and we have substituted from @xmath609 in the final step to express the relation in terms of observable quantities .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : pout_pbol ] ) therefore shows that a wind accelerated by electron scattering should have an outward momentum - rate which is proportional to that of the incident radiation field .",
    "this result ( and the associated derivation ) is directly equivalent to the one presented by @xcite .",
    "note that while @xmath610 has thus far been described as the optical depth to electron scattering it can in principal also account for additional sources of opacity in the flow , e.g. , though bound - free or bound - bound absorption , which can also be further boosted by multiple scattering events .",
    "a reasonable way of testing for the continuum - driven wind scenario is to therefore see whether @xmath15 and @xmath611 follow a linear trend .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbol_pout]a shows that the two are clearly correlated , with a slope of @xmath565 .",
    "this is consistent with the order of unity expected from equation  ( [ eqn : pout_pbol ] ) , and is also agreement with the slope of @xmath612 found by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbol_pout]b is a constraint diagram for @xmath613 showing the deviations from the expected ratio of unity ; in total , most of the sources ( 13/20 ; @xmath614 of the sample ) are formally consistent with the ratio of unity expected for a continuum - driving scenario",
    ".    another useful relationship can be obtained by multiplying equation  ( [ eqn : pout_pbol ] ) again by @xmath27 : @xmath615",
    "i.e. , the wind kinetic power is predicted to be proportional to the bolometric luminosity of the agn . in figure",
    "[ fig : lbol_raw]d we showed that @xmath14 and @xmath16 are indeed correlated ( table  [ tab : linear_regression ] ) , although the slope ( @xmath616 ) appears to be slightly steeper than ( but still marginally consistent with ) that predicted from equation  ( [ eqn : lk_lbol ] ) .",
    "the steeper slope here is probably due to the @xmath617 relationship observed before . indeed , taking this into account yields @xmath618 , which is exactly what we observe in these data .",
    "even so , it is worth noting that other acceleration mechanisms are not conclusively ruled out for these winds . if the winds are launched with zero initial radial velocity , then the terminal velocity of the wind in terms of the eddington limit is : @xmath619 , where @xmath620 is the local terminal velocity and @xmath621 is the force multiplier ( @xmath622 for thomson scattering ) . as a result ,",
    "any wind accelerated purely by thomson - scattering will not be able to greatly exceed the local terminal velocity without either : ( a ) additional sources of opacity in the flow ( such that @xmath623 ) , or ( b ) additional mechanisms transferring momenta to the flow . in this case ,",
    "additional opacity in the flow may be attributed to the outflowing gas if it is stratified and contains clumps of lower - ionisation gas .",
    "this extra opacity could perhaps be associated with the partially - covering gas required by many of our models in paper  1 . alternatively",
    ", magnetic processes may play a role in the initial acceleration which provides additional momentum to the flow , thereby allowing it to escape the system .",
    "indeed , have been proposed along these lines in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between these possibilities on the basis of existing data .",
    "considering again the continuum - driven scenario , an interesting thing of note from figure  [ fig : pbol_pout]b is that while all of the fast fek winds are consistent with the unity ratio within the errors , all of the slow winds fall below the limit ( even when only the upper - limits are considered ) .",
    "this possibly reflects subtle changes in the @xmath624 ratio which allows for the possibility of continuum - driven winds in sub - eddginton agn , whilst also allowing for subtle differences in the coupling efficiency of the gas between the two groups . as mentioned in ",
    "[ table : measured_wind_properties ] , the agn considered here are relatively tightly clustered around a mean @xmath625 which means that we are unable to reliably test how the eddington ratio affects the @xmath626 ratio .",

    "there also appears to be a transitionary phase between the two groups , with @xmath635 a few thousand @xmath636 , which may be consistent to the idea of stratified winds launched over a wide range of radii with varying velocities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the opacity estimated from @xmath537 could be lower than that of the bulk flow if ( a ) we view the wind from an acute angle where the observed velocity is not representative of the bulk flow velocity , and ( b ) the wind has a component of completely ionised gas which contributes to the scattering opacity but has no spectroscopic signatures .",
    "one possibility is that all of the winds have @xmath637 when integrated over all lines of sight and across all ionisation phases .",
    "alternatively , the fact that the slow winds have @xmath638 , coupled with the fact that they are preferentially observed in lower luminosity agn , may indicate that they are accelerated by another mechanism such as magnetic pressure , for example , which may have a larger contribution at lower luminosities ( e.g. , see @xcite )    regardless , the fast winds  which are the ones most likely to affect their host galaxy due to their large velocity and therefore the most interesting in terms of agn  host - galaxy feedback  are consistent with a wind launched by continuum scattering at the eddington limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    ) and the radiation field ( @xmath542 ) momentum rates .",

    "however , a fundamental question still remains : is the energy imparted by the mass flow likely to play a role in terms of agn  host - galaxy feedback scenarios ?",
    "agn feedback models have postulated that @xmath20 of an agns bolometric radiative output needs to be converted to mechanical power in order to have a notable effect on the growth of a central smbh and the host galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations by @xcite have shown that should the effects of ` secondary ' feedback such as cloud ablation be taken into account , the required energy can be significantly lower , of the order @xmath640 .",
    "moreover , hydrodynamic simulations have also shown that even relatively modest fek outflows ( e.g. , those with only @xmath641c , @xmath642yr@xmath6 and @xmath643ergs@xmath6 ; see @xcite ) can impart significant feedback upon the host galaxy on @xmath644kpc scales should these effects be taken into account .",
    "investigating what fraction of an agns bolometric output is conveyed through mechanical power therefore provides a means of qualitatively assessing the likely energetic significance of the mass flow . a plot of @xmath645 to this effect",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : lbol_kout ] .     to the @xmath16 of each agn in the _",
    "the horizontal lines denote @xmath646 fractions of @xmath647 and @xmath648 which are the theoretical thresholds for feedback .",
    "almost all of the fast absorption systems ( red points ) have @xmath14 in excess of @xmath647 of @xmath16 which suggests that they may be significant in terms of agn  host - galaxy feedback scenarios.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a large fraction of the outflows have a kinetic luminosity either in excess of or consistent with the @xmath647 of @xmath16 , with 10/20 also exceeding @xmath648 as well .",
    "the mean kinetic power considering only the fast winds is @xmath649 .",
    "this is well above the supposed @xmath640 threshold for significant feedback . in the most conservative case ,",
    "i.e. , by considering only @xmath650 given the available errors , we estimate @xmath651 .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath640 threshold and consistent with what was found by @xcite on the basis of the _ xmm - newton_outflow sample .",
    "therefore , even in the most conservative case , the energetic output of the fast _ suzaku_-detected fek winds is comparable to the threshold thought necessary for feedback .",
    "importantly , these estimates are derived solely from the wind kinematics and are therefore independent of the initial driving mechanism .",
    "the fek winds detected here may therefore impart enough energy into the host galaxy to play a roll in galaxy - scale feedback . with this in mind , it is useful to highlight the recent work of @xcite . to set the context of their work , it is first useful to explain the difference between momentum- and energy - driven outflows .",
    "as a wind propagates into the host galaxy it will sweep up a shell of ambient gas , the dynamics of which are determined by how efficiently the shocked wind material behind the shell can cool .",
    "initially , the shocked gas can cool efficiently ( by compton scattering ) so the shell stays thin and is driven outwards directly by the force of the wind ( cf .",
    "our equation  [ eqn : pout_pbol ] ; also @xcite ) .",
    "this is momentum - driven feedback . as the outflow reaches larger distances , however , the cooling efficiency drops and the shocked gas becomes geometrically thick and hot .",
    "the outwards force on the shell then comes from the wind thrust in equation ( [ eqn : pout_pbol ] ) mediated by the thermal ppressure and work done on and by the shocked gas .",
    "this is energy - driven feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the transition between the two phases can occur at relatively small radii ( see @xcite ) , and energy - driven outflows are therefore expected to be dominant on large galactic scales .",
    "@xcite consider purely energy - driven outflows and investigate their link to the observed @xmath652 relationship .",
    "they showed that , for an energy - driven shell to reach the escape speed from an isothermal sphere of dark matter and gas with velocity dispersion @xmath548 requires a critical bh mass given by @xmath653 such that the velocity of the wind from the black hole ( @xmath27 ) enters explicitly .",
    "mcquillin & mclaughlin used this equation to infer the wind speed that would have been needed during the active protogalactic phase of 51 quiescent ( @xmath654 ) galaxy spheroids ( taken from the sample of @xcite ) in order to explain the observed values of @xmath655 and @xmath548 in these galaxies as a result of ( energy - driven ) feedback .",
    "their main result is a distribution of bh wind speeds , derived in essence from the scatter of the @xmath652 relation , that bears a remarkable resemblance to the empirical distributions of @xmath27 in the agn samples of both @xcite and paper  i.     relation ( c.f . , @xcite )",
    "is induced by energy - driven feedback , with @xmath656 .",
    "the blue and black arrows correspond to the median outflow velocites of @xmath657c and @xmath658c in the _",
    "suzaku_-observed agn and quiescent sub - samples , respectively .",
    "the two samples are formally indistinguishable by the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . see text for further discussion.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure  [ fig : mcquillin ] compares the velocity distribution inferred by @xcite to the one that we measured for _ suzaku_-detected fek outflows ( note that we consider all of the outflows in this panel ) . as noted by mcquillin & mclaughlin , there is a close resemblance between the two , with both samples tracing a similar overall distribution .",
    "their overall range are similar , as is their median : @xmath659c in the quiescent galaxies , and @xmath660c for the _ suzaku_-detected outflows ( see paper i ) .",
    "formally , the two distributions can not be distinguished : a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test only rules their being from the same parent population at @xmath661 confidence . the fact that there are similarities between the inferred and observed @xmath27 distributions at all is in itself extremely interesting , not only because the independent samples of quiescent galaxies and agn are drawn from two different sub - populations of galaxy , but because it implies a close relationship between the emergent wind and the evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "overall , the work of @xcite is encouraging for the general notion that high - velocity outflows contribute to the feedback which is invoked to explain the @xmath652 relationship in local quiescent galaxies , and , more importantly , for the idea that agn play a key role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in paper  i we formed a detailed spectroscopic study of fek absoption in a heterogeneous sample of 52 _ suzaku_-observed agn .",
    "there , we found that @xmath1 of the sources in the sample harboured statistically significant fexxvi  he@xmath24and / or fexxvi  ly@xmath24absorption lines with velocities ranging from a few thousand kms@xmath6 to @xmath662c .",
    "we also measured their column density ionisation parameter of the absorber using the xstarphotoionisation code . here , we build upon these results to compute the location @xmath159 , mass outflow rate @xmath13 , kinetic power @xmath14 and momentum flux @xmath15 of the implied wind , and use these results to inform an exploratory analysis of how the wind parameters scale with the bolometric luminosity of their host agn .",
    "we focus our attention on the fastest winds , defined here as @xmath663 , because these ones likely represent genuine disk - winds which are likely distinct from the slower ( and more distant ) warm absorber .",
    "the main results of our study are summarised below .    1 .",
    "the mean radial distance to the fast winds is @xmath664 cm ( typically @xmath4 ) from the black hole .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath665pc , such that the fek absorbers are located much closer to the black hole than the traditional parsec - scale warm absorber",
    ". the mean wind mass outflow rate and mean kinetic power are constrained to @xmath666gs@xmath6 ( @xmath667 ) and @xmath668ergs@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the average upper limit is @xmath669 , but is still an appreciable @xmath478 of @xmath479 if only the lower limits are considered , whereas the kinetic power is constrained to @xmath670 .",
    "these properties are consistent with wind at a substantial fraction of the eddington limit which carries a large amount of mass into the host galaxy .",
    "the fek absorber column density and ionisation parameter are largely independent of @xmath16 but there is a significant correlation between the wind velocity @xmath27 and @xmath16 , with a slope @xmath553 .",
    "this tentatively indicates that more luminous agn launch winds with a larger observed velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "the winds in more luminous agn contain more material , and they are subsequently more energetic",
    ". the median slope of the @xmath561 and @xmath562 regressions are formally consistent with unity .",
    "there are no significant correlations in the @xmath572 and @xmath573 planes .",
    "therefore , the winds are located at similar distances in schwarzschild units and contain a similar fraction of @xmath479 . + 5 .   the momentum flux of the radiation field ( @xmath542 ) and that of the wind ( @xmath15 ) are strongly correlated , with a slope @xmath565 .",
    "this is quantitatively consistent with what is expected from a continuum - driven wind .",
    "a significant fraction of the sample ( @xmath671 , @xmath672 ) exceed the minimum @xmath18 threshold thought necessary for feedback ( @xcite ) , while @xmath673 ( @xmath19 ) also exceed the less conservative @xmath20 threshold as well ( @xcite ) . in the most conservative case ,",
    "the mean @xmath646 ratio is @xmath674 .",
    "this suggests that the winds may be sufficiently energetic in terms of feedback .",
    "these results enforce those recently obtained with _ xmm - newton_and provide additional evidence in favour of fek absorption being a prevalent feature of the agn x - ray spectrum , and that the ensuing wind may be energetically significant in terms of feedback .",
