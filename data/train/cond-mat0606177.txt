    "it has been over two decades since the first discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity ( htsc ) in copper oxide materials @xcite .",
    "theoretically , soon after the discovery of the high-@xmath0 cuprates , the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory , a strong coupling version of the spin fluctuation approach , was introduced by anderson @xcite . after anderson s original conjecture , zhang and rice derived a single - band effective hamiltonian for htsc cuprates @xcite .",
    "wen and lee developed the su(2)-gauge theory of the strong coupling nature for the doped @xmath8-@xmath9 model @xcite .",
    "varma and co - workers established the marginal fermi liquid theory to explain many of the anomalous behaviors in cuprates @xcite .",
    "zhang proposed a very interesting and unified theory based on the so(5 ) symmetry of superconducting ( sc ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , dagotto @xcite and lee _",
    "et al_. lee gave comprehensive reviews of the mechanisms of the htsc .",
    "in spite of extensive theoretical efforts , the mechanism of the htsc in the cuprates remains a profound unsolved mystery of modern physics .",
    "now , the majority view on the mechanism is that the weak - coupling mean - field bcs theory bcs , which is based on electron - phonon interaction , may not be suitable for the high superconducting transition caused by strong correlations .",
    "experimentally , accumulating evidences show that the pairing mechanism of htsc is relevant to the real - space ( a localized picture ) electron - electron correlations .",
    "one of the most striking experimental fact is the observation of a periodic pattern in the local electron density of states ( ldos ) by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one of the most exciting experimental evidences in favor of the localized cooper pairs have just been reported @xcite , the excellent experiment implies the possible generic existence of the real space superconducting pair correlations in amorphous insulating and other nonsuperconducting systems such as underdoped high-@xmath0 superconductors above @xmath0 .",
    "very recently , anderson pointed out that many theories about electron pairing in cuprate superconductors may be on the wrong track @xcite . in the paper , it is clearly shown that the framework of dynamic screening ( quasiparticle ) is impossible to provide the glue  for the high-@xmath0 copper oxide superconductors , as the net interaction between electrons is always repulsive .",
    "if this is the correct viewpoint , but what will be the glue  binding the electrons in pairs ?    compared to conventional superconductors , besides their exceptionally high superconducting transition temperatures , there are many anomalous physical properties in high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "it appears to be generally accepted that conventional bcs superconductors are characterized by a standard @xmath10-wave , while the symmetry of the high-@xmath0 superconducting order parameter is believed to be @xmath1-wave for the hole - doped ( @xmath11-type ) cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , for the electron - doped ( @xmath12-type ) cuprates there is much controversy about whether the order parameter has a @xmath13-wave symmetry @xcite , or @xmath1-wave armitage , tsuei1,snezhko , ariando , or a nonmonotonic @xmath1-wave @xcite , or a crossover from a @xmath1-wave symmetry for underdoped compositions to a @xmath10-wave symmetry for the overdoped region @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been one of the experimental facts that underdoped cuprates possess a pseudogap @xcite in the non - superconducting state with anomalous physical properties below a temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the origin of the pseudogap has become a challenging issue as it might eventually lead to identify the superconducting mechanism .",
    "a class of theoretical models attempted to describe the pseudogap state as a precursor of the superconducting @xmath1-wave gap @xcite .    to date",
    ", more experimental results indicate that the charge - ordered stripes in cuprates represent a specific type of order that has been experimentally observed to compete with superconductivity kivelson , tranquada , norman , ichikawa .",
    "the stripes are a real - space pattern , in which the charge carriers condense into rivers of charge separated by insulating domains @xcite .",
    "generally , stripes are classified as metallic or insulating .",
    "it is considered that the static stripe order ( insulating ) is bad for superconductivity and is responsible for the suppression of the superconducting transition temperature @xcite , while the dynamic stripes ( metallic ) are essential to the superconductivity in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "more recently , strong experimental evidence from the stm studies suggest the presence of a 4-lattice constant checkerboard charge order in underdoped cuprates at the doping level 1/8 , which are referred to as the 1/8 anomaly  @xcite . in addition , the checkerboard - type ordering of the charge carriers at magic doping fractions  have been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "castellani _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that such commensurate stripes should be insulating .",
    "furthermore , the underlying crystalline electronic orders ( or wigner crystals ) of charge carriers in cuprates of low doping level have been proposed @xcite . in view of these interesting experimental results and heuristic theoretical proposals",
    ", it is now a clear viewpoint that any interpretation of superconductivity in the cuprates must account for the real - space charge stripes .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to unveil the mystery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "we argue that the mechanism of superconductivity in both electron - doped and hole - doped cuprate superconductors should be established on a picture of pure electrons .",
    "we show that this scenario can be used to explain the basic phenomenology of the high-@xmath0 superconductors from the pairing mechanism to charge stripes .",
    "we attempt to provide answers to the following open questions : are the pairing and superconducting mechanism of the electron- and hole - doped cuprates different ? what will be the glue  to hold the electron pairs together ?",
    "what is the one - dimensional nature of the stripes ?",
    "are they insulators or metals ?",
    "do the stripes compete with superconductivity , help superconductivity or hinder it ?",
    "ever since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity , many different cuprate superconductors were synthesized .",
    "it should be noted that though the structures of these materials may be different , the essential structure to be concerned about is that of the same two - dimensional cuo@xmath15 planes in them . in particular ,",
    "the so - called hole - doped la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 , due to its relatively simpler structure but a more complex phase diagram , is the best studied material .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) , the partial substitution of sr@xmath17 for la@xmath18 will result in a deficiency of electrons in the charge reservoirs and a leaving of electrons from o ions ( o@xmath19 of cuo@xmath15 planes to the charge reservoirs . to maintain the local symmetry and the stability of the cuo@xmath15 plane ,",
    "the other two o@xmath20 ( adjacent the o@xmath21 ) tend to donate two electrons which would likely to be trapped in the center of the four o@xmath22 [ fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) ] .",
    "physically , the effect of the local distortion pattern in fig . [ fig1](c ) is to minimize the system s energy . in this case",
    ", these two electrons will experience a strong real space coulomb confinement [ see insets of fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) ] imposed by the charge reservoirs and the local structure distortion in the cuo@xmath15 plane .",
    "it should be noted that the central character ( charge carrier ) in this paper is in fact not the artificial hole , but the real electron .",
    "normally , quantum theory assumes that the charge carriers prefer to stay and travel ( or hopping ) in the most crowdedand complicated cu@xmath23o chains , as shown in fig . [ fig1](d ) .",
    "it now appears that the paired electrons ( or holes ) in the cuo@xmath15 planes has two possible choices , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) and fig .",
    "which situation would the pair be inclined to choice ? if we believe that charge carriers do appear as suggested by quantum mechanics in the cu@xmath23o chains [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] , then there will be a strong coulomb interaction among the charge carriers and the ions ( cu@xmath24 and o@xmath20 ) , consequently increase the compound s energy and this in turn could decrease the system s stability .",
    "while for the case of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , the coulomb interaction among the charge carriers and the ions will be greatly reduced , as a result , increase the system s stability .",
    "therefore , we argue that the conventional hole - doping picture of fig . [",
    "fig1](d ) is physically inadequate .",
    "having applied the hole concept greatly in solid - state physics , we are faced with the challenge of constructing an effective physical picture for this mysterious quasiparticle : what would a hole pair look like if it did exist ?",
    "the point of view taken here is that the real  holes arise from unique chemical construction in cuo@xmath25 plan .",
    "it was assumed that , in the hole doped high-@xmath0 superconductors , the hole pairs ( the sizeless particles carried a positive electric charge and a spin ) can maintain their integrity in a square lattice and move [ as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1](c ) , when the two electrons sit on the square lattice , we have a real  hole pair pattern as illustrated in fig . [ fig2](b ) . as one can see from the figure , it appears that the static hole pair ( state a ) can be thought of as a dressed electron pair in cuo@xmath15 ( cu@xmath26 , o@xmath19 plane .",
    "however , it is shown that this real  hole pair is structural unstable .",
    "a fatal difficulty occurs when the pair is moving from a to b [ see fig .",

    ", it is clearly shown the simplest possible movement of one real  hole pair , in fact , involving a very complicated transportation of six electrons ( there are infinite possible ways to move  the pair , note that only one set of possible movement of the electrons is indicated in the figure ) .",
    "therefore , it is hard to imagine that the real  hole pair can always maintain its integrity during the hopping  process . on this basis",
    ", we argue that the artificial holes should be abandoned .",
    "anyway , one should be cautious when drawing conclusions based on the concept of hole . as emphasized by hirsch , using the language of ` holes ' rather than ` electrons ' in fact obscures the essential physics since these electrons are the ones that ` undress ' and carry the supercurrent ( as electrons , not as holes ) in the superconducting state @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we shall illustrate the superconductive properties of the so - called hole - doped high-@xmath0 cuprates in a pure electron picture ( without the hole concept ) .",
    "in conventional superconductors , bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) bcs argued that phonons ( atomic lattice vibrations ) act as the glue  that binds the electron pairs together .",
    "but at high temperatures , the vibrational motion of the material s lattice becomes so stiff that it tends to break up the electron pairs instead of holding them together @xcite .",
    "so what could possibly provide the glue that keeps the carriers bound in cooper pairs ?",
    "although many candidates for this glue ( including spin fluctuations , phonons , polarons , charge stripes and spin stripes ) have been proposed .",
    "however , what the pairing glue is in high-@xmath0 cuprates is still an open question . in this section",
    ", i would like to discuss the issue from the point of view of real - space electron - electron interaction . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we are studying the pairing symmetry of electron- ( @xmath12-type ) and hole - doped ( @xmath11-type ) cuprate superconductors .",
    "the section ended with a brief discussion of pseudogap .",
    "since the observation of real - space ordering of charge in cuprate superconductors @xcite , it is widely accepted that short - range electron - electron correlations can bind electrons into real space pairs and dominate the superconductivity properties of the materials . normally , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for the two static electrons , there is a on - site long - range repulsive electron - electron coulomb interaction @xmath27where @xmath28 is the electron charge and @xmath29 is the distance between two electrons .",
    "due to this strong repulsion of eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) between electrons , the confinement scenario of fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) does nt mean that the targeted electrons can be naturally paired .",
    "so how can repulsive coulomb forces exerted on electrons be eliminated so that the electrons can be in pairs ?",
    "it is known that study of superconducting correlations in conventional superconductors is always performed in momentum - space ( dynamic screening ) , where the paired electrons are seldom or never in the same place at the same time @xcite . in the case of dynamic screening , only the long - range coulomb interaction @xmath30",
    "is considered while the short - range electron  electron magnetic interactions is completely ignored .",
    "we argue here that , in the case of real - space screening , the magnetic forces among the electrons ( see also fig.[fig3 ] ) could provide a strong glue  for electron pairing leading to high-@xmath0 superconductivity in cuprate superconductors . approximately , the magnetic dipolar interaction forces @xmath31 exerted on the electrons are given by @xmath32where @xmath33 is the permeability of free space and @xmath34 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the forces @xmath31 can be attractive and repulsive depending on the orientation ( @xmath35and @xmath36 ) of electron magnetic moment @xmath37 , ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "when @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 , the magnetic poles of the paired electrons are lined up in parallel , consequently , the attractive magnetic force reaches its maximum value @xmath41 when @xmath42 we have a stable electron pair with the distance @xmath43 as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the speed of light in vacuum .    because of the short - range interaction characteristics of eq .",
    "( [ fm ] ) , as is usually the case @xmath46 , then it is clear that the glue  ( attractive magnetic force @xmath47 ) works only if the cuprate superconductors has the effect of weakening the long - range repulsive force @xmath48 .",
    "we presume that the real - space confinement effect ( electromagnetic interactions ) in cuo@xmath15 plane [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ] plays a central role in suppressing the influence of the coulomb repulsion between electrons . to describe this , two spin parallel electrons of fig .",

    "it is important to note that no quasiparticles are involved in the above studies , hence the presented real space pairing mechanism ( glue ) can be regarded as a self - pairing mechanism due to the intrinsic electromagnetic exchange coupling between the real electrons .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the dynamic screening ( quasiparticle approximation ) is related to a glue  in the high-@xmath0 cuprates where the net interaction contributed by quasiparticle  is found always repulsive , as emphasized by anderson @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the pairing symmetry . in recent years a number of experiments have indicated that the predominant real - space @xmath1-wave symmetry in hole - doped cuprate superconductors @xcite .",

    "within the proposed real - space confinement mechanism , the pairing picture for the electron - doped systems is remarkably similar to that of the hole - doped cuprates , with one major difference comes from the substitution of o@xmath22 by o@xmath20 ( see also fig .",

    "this substitution , on the one hand , greatly enhance the confinement effect by increasing @xmath54 in ( 100 ) , ( 010 ) , ( @xmath5300 ) and ( 0@xmath530 ) directions and in turn will shorten the distance @xmath52 and increase the binding energy , on the other hand , it can greatly reduce the possibility of the pair - breaking  along directions ( 110 ) , ( @xmath5310 ) , ( @xmath570 ) and ( 1@xmath730 ) , in other words , now the diagonal s pair is more likely to survive in the electron - doped cuprates than in the hole - doped cuprates . roughly speaking , our unified model for cuprate superconductivity yields for the hole - doped ( _ p_-type ) and electron - doped ( _ n_-type ) cuprates to have essentially the same pairing mechanisms , but different spatial pairing symmetries .    to make the arguments of pairing symmetry more convincing , below more detailed studies",

    ", the pair will stay at the most unstable state in the pair s orientation due to the strong repulsive coulomb interaction between the two electrons in this direction , we are therefore paying particular attention to the confinement effect in the same direction as the orientation of the pair . if the electron pair is oriented in @xmath69- and @xmath70-axis or the diagonal directions , because of the structural symmetry , we can present the explicit analytical expressions of the confinement effects . figures fig5(a ) and ( b ) illustrate the eight coulombic forces and the total confinement forces [ @xmath74 @xmath75 exerted on the two electrons of the pair in ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) directions of the cuprate samples , respectively .",

    "having obtained the strongest confinement @xmath96 and the weakest confinement @xmath97 for both hole- and electron - doped cuprates ( see fig .",

    "we think the suggested scenario offers a new way for physical interpretation of the pairing symmetry in the cuprates .",
    "the nature of the normal - state gap ( pseudogap ) phase of htsc is also highly controversial @xcite .",

    "our results suggest that the pseudogap is a general feature of all transition metal oxides , not just cuprate superconductors .",
    "the newly observations of the  cooper pair localization in the amorphous insulating systems @xcite , in fact , reveal that pair correlations may be built up in the real space confinement screening and the pseudogap is a common feature in nature materials that is consistent with our arguments in this section .",
    "physically , pairing in cuprates is an individual behavior characterized by pseudogap , while superconductivity is a collective behavior of many coherent electron pairs .",
    "nowadays , more and more beautiful experimental results suggest that stripes are common in cuprates and may be important in the mechanism for htsc hanaguri , tranquada , norman , kim , noda , zhou , mook , vershinin , wakimoto , keimer , kastner , momono . here , we argue that there are only two specific stripes which would contribute to the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors and the dynamical spin density wave ( sdw ) coherent phases can be established along the stripes .      in nature , periodic structures are often considered as the result of competition between different interactions .",
    "the formation of stripe patterns is generally attributed to the competition between short - range attractive forces and long - range repulsive forces @xcite .",

    "consequently , the material  composed of electron - pair atoms  will undergo a structure transition from random to order phase ( lto or ltt ) .",
