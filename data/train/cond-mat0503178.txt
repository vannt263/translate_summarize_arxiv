    "the discovery of the interlayer exchange coupling ( iec ) has triggered a renewed interest in the physics of ultrathin metallic films in the last decades .",
    "the term iec denotes the coupling of magnetic layers separated by non magnetic spacer layers that occurs in quite a number of metallic and semiconducting systems.@xcite the general mechanism of the coupling and a lot of additional features are well understood today .",
    "the coupling is caused by spin dependent reflection of spacer electrons at the magnet / non - magnet interfaces leading to a spin dependent interference and therewith to a spin dependent renormalization of the density of states ( dos ) and the free energy within the spacer.@xcite the modification of the spacer dos and energy depends sensitively on the relative orientation of the magnetic layers favoring a special configuration .",
    "this results in the interlayer coupling .",
    "the coupling may be ferro- or antiferromagnetic and oscillates with respect to the spacer thickness .",
    "the periods of the oscillation depend on the spacer fermi surface , while the amplitudes as well as the phases may be additionally influenced by interface roughness , interdiffusion , disorder , and related effects .",
    "+ however , up to now it is not clear which kind of process dominates the temperature dependence of the coupling .",
    "there are several candidates which are evaluated and compared in ref .  :    * one source of temperature dependence is connected with the described coupling mechanism and is caused by the smearing out of the fermi - surface of the spacer.@xcite furthermore temperature influences the reflection coefficients at the magnet / non - magnet interfaces.@xcite both processes influence the energy of the spacer layer and will be called `` spacer effect '' in the following . *",
    "another source of temperature dependence are magnetic excitations , altering the properties of the magnetic layers@xcite ( `` magnetic layer effect '' )",
    ". thermal magnetic disorder may drastically reduce the energy difference between parallel and antiparallel alignment of the magnetic layers and therewith the interlayer coupling .    to find the dominating mechanism elaborate ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) measurements were performed at a prototype trilayer,@xcite namely a @xmath0 system where the subscripts denote the number of atomic layers of each film .",
    "the data are analyzed using a classical continuum model , where the classical equation of motion for the magnetization @xcite or an expansion of the free energy@xcite is considered .",
    "this analysis gives the temperature dependence of an effective interlayer coupling @xmath1 which is discussed in detail in ref .   and reconsidered in ref .  .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the energy difference between the state where the magnetization of both magnetic films are parallel to each other and the state where the magnetization of the lower magnetic film are aligned antiparallel to the magnetization of the upper one : @xmath2 note that the magnetic moments are supposed to be parallel within the magnetic films .",
    "the most important feature of @xmath1 found experimentally is its effective @xmath3-like decrease with temperature . naturally both temperature dependencies , i.e. the temperature dependence due to the fermi surface softening and those due to magnetic excitations , are included in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , since both mechanisms ( i ) and ( ii ) contribute , the dominating mechanism can not be deduced directly from @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite + on the other hand a procedure sensitive to only one of the mechanisms ( i ) or ( ii ) would be highly desirable .",
    "it would allow to separate the mechanisms and to deduce the source of temperature dependence of the iec directly from the measurements .",
    "it is the intention of this paper to show that such a procedure exists .",
    "the new approach is based on an alternative analysis of fmr measurements using the microscopic heisenberg model .",
    "+ to illustrate the idea let us consider a modeling of the considered trilayer systems : @xmath4 where @xmath5 runs over the two different layers while @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote a lattice site within a layer . for convenience the sums in the first lines are taken over nearest neighbors only .",
    "thus the _ intra_layer coupling parameters @xmath8 as well as the _ inter_layer coupling parameter @xmath9 are effective parameters containing also the contributions of non - nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the model describes two magnetic layers coupled by the interlayer coupling @xmath9 , which may be positive or negative .",
    "the intralayer coupling constants @xmath10 are chosen to be positive to describe ferromagnetic layers .",
    "the model further accounts for anisotropies due to spin orbit ( @xmath11 ) and dipolar ( @xmath12 ) coupling as well as for an external field @xmath13 applied in arbitrary direction .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 denotes the land@xmath15 factor of the layer @xmath5 .",
    "the anisotropy due to spin - orbit coupling @xmath11 , which includes magnetocrystalline as well as magnetoelastic contributions,@xcite will often be termed `` lattice anisotropy '' in the following .",
    "the film plane is the @xmath16-plane and tetragonal symmetry is assumed .",
    "such a model is often used to describe magnetic properties of transition metal films,@xcite especially in the presence of anisotropies .",
    "note that the spacer of the trilayer system is not considered explicitely but its effects on the magnetic layers are described by the model parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the latter is proportional to the energy difference between the states of parallel and antiparallel aligned magnetizations in both layers , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , if saturated magnetism is assumed .",
    "this applies for @xmath19 or at finite temperatures for cases where the spin wave excitations of the model ( [ model - rough ] ) are artificially frozen . for the latter case a temperature dependence of @xmath9 can be caused exclusively by excitations within the spacer .",
    "hence , @xmath20 is proportional to the difference between the energy contributions _ of the spacer _ in the parallel and antiparallel state : @xmath21 + now we want to connect the model ( [ model - rough ] ) with the mentioned fmr experiments .",
    "the probed quantity of an fmr experiment is the so called `` resonance frequency '' that is identical to the spin wave mode with infinite wavelength @xmath22.@xcite this mode is also called uniform ( @xmath23 ) mode . in a coupled bilayer system",
    "there are two such excitations , termed optical and acoustical mode ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this can easily be understood if a semiclassical spin model is considered .",
    "the uniform mode of a monolayer corresponds to a spin wave where all spins rotate in phase .",
    "the acoustical mode of the coupled bilayer system corresponds to the state where the spins in both layers rotate in phase .",
    "if the optical mode is excited , the spins in the upper layer rotate in anti - phase compared to the spins of the lower layer . depending on the coupling sign",
    ", the optical mode can be found at higher ( ferromagnetic interlayer coupling ) or at lower frequencies ( antiferromagnetic coupling ) .",
    "note that the fmr technique has equal access to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling . in this picture",
    "the distance between the modes @xmath25 is a measure for the interlayer coupling strength if equivalent magnetic layers are assumed .",
    "+ in practice , during an fmr experiment the probe frequency @xmath26 is fixed in the microwave region , while the magnitude of the external field is varied until the resonance frequency equals the probe frequency .",
    "@xmath27 this relation is fulfilled at special magnitudes of the external field called `` resonance fields '' ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the values of the resonance fields as functions of the direction of the applied external fields ( @xmath29 ) is the most important experimental output.@xcite for an appropriately chosen probe frequency there are also two resonance fields in a coupled bilayer system ( [ model - rough ] ) belonging to the optical and acoustical mode .",
    "again , the distance between the resonance fields ( @xmath30 ) is influenced by the interlayer coupling strength @xmath9 and the anisotropies in both layers .",
    "an fmr experiment can be analyzed using the model ( [ model - rough ] ) by calculating the spin wave modes @xmath31 and the resonance fields @xmath28 and fitting the model parameters until the calculated values correspond to the measured ones .",
    "it is possible to obtain the interlayer coupling as well as the anisotropy strengths from the angular dependence of the resonance fields .",
    "+ let us now consider the temperature dependence of the resonance frequencies and fields .",
    "there are two principal sources of temperature dependence :    1 .",
    "if the parameters of the model ( [ model - rough ] ) are fitted to real systems as proposed above , they may be temperature dependent itself .",
    "this applies especially to the interlayer coupling parameter @xmath9 which is not a fundamental microscopic coupling constant but rather given in eq .",
    "( [ ji ] ) and which may be significantly influenced by temperature.@xcite as seen in eq .",
    "( [ ji ] ) the temperature dependence of @xmath20 describes the temperature dependence of the spacer energies .",
    "2 .   additionally ,",
    "even if the model parameters are fixed , there is an intrinsic temperature dependence of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the model ( [ model - rough ] ) due to interactions of spin waves excited within the magnetic layers .",
    "it is obvious that the temperature dependence of the model parameter @xmath20 can be identified to the `` spacer effect '' ( i ) while the intrinsic temperature dependence due to spin wave interactions is equivalent to the `` magnetic layer effect '' ( ii ) .",
    "+ in this situation the microscopic model ( [ model - rough ] ) can be used to study the mechanisms ( i ) and ( ii ) separately . on",
    "the one hand one can fit the model parameters to experimental fmr data which gives the function @xmath20 .",
    "the latter exclusively describes the temperature dependence of the iec due to the `` spacer effect '' ( i ) .",
    "+ on the other hand the model parameters and especially @xmath9 can be fixed .",
    "then one can investigate the temperature dependence of the resonance frequencies due to spin wave interactions .",
    "thus the temperature dependence of the fmr signal caused by the magnetic layer effect ( ii ) alone can be analyzed .",
    "+ the motivation of our paper is twofold .",
    "first we want to show that an evaluation of fmr data is in principle possible by use of the microscopic model ( [ model - rough ] ) . however , our paper is mainly dedicated to the investigation of the second point , i.e. of the temperature dependence of the fmr signal caused by the interaction of spin waves .",
    "+ the paper is organized in the following way : + using our microscopic model we will discuss two quantities : the resonance frequencies @xmath32 and the resonance fields @xmath28 .",
    "we will consider a monolayer ( simulating a single film ) as well as a system of two coupled layers ( which simulates prototype iec - trilayer systems ) .",
    "we compare the results of the classical model with those of the microscopic model at zero temperature before we discuss the intrinsic temperature dependence of the resonance frequencies and fields in detail . with this procedure",
    "we want to answer the following central questions :    * is there a relevant intrinsic temperature dependence of the uniform spin wave modes in the model ( [ model - rough ] ) and how is it characterized ? * what are the differences between the results of our microscopic approach and of the macroscopic classical model for zero temperature , in other words , can the microscopic model give new insight in fmr experiments at a fixed temperature , too ?",
    "it turns out that the latter is indeed the case . for a nickel films grown on a cu(001 )",
    "surface the absence of a resonance field in the hard direction was reported.@xcite this observation follows directly for larger out - of - plane lattice anisotropies in the microscopic model , while it can be hardly explained within the classical model . furthermore we will find a significant temperature dependence of the uniform modes due to spin wave interactions .",
    "a description of this temperature dependence in terms of effective model parameters ( @xmath34 and @xmath35(t ) ) is possible approximately only and justified only for lower temperatures @xmath36 . before turning to the presentation of our results",
    "we will shortly discuss the approximations used to solve the model ( [ model - rough ] ) .",
    "the intended use poses clear requirements to the theory .",
    "its numerical effort must be moderate to keep the fitting procedure feasible , while it has to yield accurate results for the spin waves for arbritrary directions and magnitudes of the external field .",
    "such a theory is proposed and evaluated in ref .   and applied to our model ( [ model - rough ] ) in the next section .",
    "as already mentioned this contribution uses results and insights from earlier works , namely from ref . and ref .",
    "the former ( ref . ) discusses and compares the different mechanisms that may cause a temperature dependence of the interlayer exchange coupling on a very general level therewith clearly formulating the problem we want to consider in this paper . the latter ( ref . )",
    "is mere technically proposing a theory to solve our model ( [ model - rough ] ) .",
    "in this section we want to motivate the theoretical approach used to solve the extended heisenberg model ( [ model - rough ] ) . due to the tetragonal symmetry the directions in the film plane are equivalent .",
    "this allows us to restrict our calculations to a plane perpendicular to the film , the @xmath37-plane .",
    "the external field and the magnetization are confined to this plane in the following : @xmath38 to proceed we split the hamiltonian ( [ model - rough ] ) into two parts .",
    "the first one , @xmath39 contains all terms except for the dipolar coupling . in a previous paper@xcite we developed a theory for the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) for the special case of a monolayer .",
    "it was shown by comparison with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results@xcite that our approximation is in fact very accurate for arbritrary directions of the external field and can therefore be used here .",
    "our proposal combines an rpa decoupling procedure@xcite applied to the nonlocal heisenberg exchange terms and a generalized anderson callen approximation@xcite for the local anisotropy term .",
    "details are given in ref .  .",
    "the theory is based on a transformation into a local coordinate system @xmath40 where the new @xmath41-axis is parallel to the magnetization .",
    "it is easy to generalize this theory to a multilayer system if the rpa decoupling is also used for the interlayer coupling term .",
    "a remarkable result of this theory is that the anisotropy and the interlayer coupling can be replaced by internal fields @xmath42 in the single magnon green function matrix of the transformed system : @xmath43 the effective field is a sum of the external field , a term due to the anisotropy and a further term resulting from the interlayer coupling : @xmath44 the interlayer field is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the number of nearest neighbors in the adjacent layer @xmath47 .",
    "for the anisotropy field one finds @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the angle between the @xmath50-axis and the magnetization in layer @xmath5 .",
    "note that the anisotropy field @xmath51 is not an analytic function of the magnetization @xmath52 only , but of @xmath53-terms as well .",
    "the single - magnon green function ( [ gf - def ] ) is now a functional of the effective fields : @xmath54 via the matrix @xmath55 : @xmath56 generally , the magnetization angles in both layers , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , may be different .",
    "note that the coordinate system is rotated by @xmath57 in layer @xmath59 and by @xmath58 in layer @xmath60 .",
    "thus the @xmath41-axes in both layers are not parallel to each other .",
    "the respective angles are determined by the effective fields @xmath61 eq . ( [ gf ] ) is valid as long as the deviations between the magnetization angles of different layers are small .",
    "+ the coordination number within a layer is denoted by @xmath62 and the structural factors @xmath63 and @xmath64 are a consequence of the two dimensional fourier transformation and depend on the lattice structure . for the fcc(100 ) geometry considered here",
    "they are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the lattice constant .",
    "+ from the single - magnon green function ( [ gf ] ) one can easily obtain the expectation values @xmath67 and @xmath68 using the standard text book procedure @xcite which can be generalized to film geometries straightforwardly .",
    "@xcite additionally the spin wave frequencies @xmath69 are directly given by the eigenvalues @xmath70 of the matrix @xmath55 .",
    "( [ eff - field1 ] ) - ( [ angle ] ) establish a self consistent set of equations and thus the problem is solved as far as the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is concerned .",
    "+ now the dipolar term @xmath71 has to be treated .",
    "the interaction is nonlocal and very similar to the heisenberg exchange terms .",
    "thus an rpa decoupling would be certainly a good choice .",
    "however it was shown in ref .   that the more feasible mean field decoupling also yields acceptable results .",
    "a further term has to be added to the effective field ( [ eff - field1 ] ) due to the dipolar coupling : @xmath72 where the dipolar field is given by@xcite @xmath73 the sum runs over all lattice sites of a layer .",
    "there are no further changes in the relations ( [ eff - field1])- ( [ angle ] ) due to the dipolar coupling .",
    "thus the effective field @xmath74 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eff - field2 ] ) and ( [ dipol - field ] ) simply has to replace the field @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ eff - field1 ] ) if one wants to account for dipolar coupling . +",
    "as already mentioned before , this theory is capable of calculating the whole spin wave excitation spectrum and especially the uniform modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 . therewith the resonance fields @xmath28 can be obtained for any microwave probe frequency @xmath26 .",
    "this holds for arbritrary external field directions and for any temperature .",
    "thus one can calculate the central functions @xmath29 and @xmath77 as well as the dependence of the resonance frequency on the external field @xmath78 .",
    "the latter is often referred to as `` dispersion relation '' in connection with fmr experiments and gives the excitation gap @xmath79 .",

    "the magnetization is now rotated out of its easy direction and finally aligned parallel to the external field if the latter exceeds a certain value called reorientation field.@xcite if the external field is enhanced further the    magnetization does not change its orientation any more and the spin wave frequency @xmath88 is again a linearly increasing function of the external field . however , before the reorientation field is reached , @xmath98 is constant ( for dipolar coupling ) or decreases ( for lattice anisotropies ) as a function of the external field .",
    "there is an interesting feature for negative @xmath99 : at the reorientation field the resonance frequency is zero , i.e. the excitation gap is closed in spite of the presence of an external field and lattice anisotropies .",
    "this is not found for positive values of @xmath99 or for dipolar coupling , where the gap stays finite at the reorientation field ( left panel ) . in such cases",
    "the probe frequency @xmath26 may be lower than the resonance frequency @xmath88 for all angles @xmath103 and no resonance field is detected at all .",
    "this feature is not reproduced by the classical model , but experimental evidence for such a scenario was indeed reported for nickel films with enhanced uniaxial anisotropy.@xcite + there are more differences between the classical and quantum mechanical theory for negative anisotropies and dipolar coupling , namely for field values that are smaller than the reorientation field .",
    "consider , for example , an external field applied perpendicularly to the easy direction ( @xmath104 , dots ) . here the resonance frequency and therewith the excitation gap is zero for all field values below the reorientation field in the classical calculation .",
    "the same is expected for the quantum mechanical calculation , since in this region the magnetization has a finite component parallel to the film plane in the ground state and thus the ground state is degenerated with respect to the azimutal angle @xmath105 of the magnetization . therefore a goldstone mode is expected , i.e. the spin - wave energy for @xmath23 should be zero .",
    "this feature is not reproduced by our approximation , since it restricts the problem to a plane perpendicular to the film plane .",

    "[ fig4 ] . since the resonance fields for higher anisotropies are further away from the paramagnetic solution they react more sensitively to temperature than the resonance fields for the low anisotropy system .",
    "the distance between the modes is reduced by temperature for all considered systems .",
    "+ the behavior in the hard direction case is similar .",
    "the acoustical resonance fields are larger than the paramagnetic one and consequently the fields are reduced by temperature .",
    "the resonance fields of the optical mode increase with temperature for the low anisotropy and for the asymmetric film system since they are smaller than the paramagnetic field .",
    "if the resonance field is very close to the paramagnetic one the resonance field may behave non monotonically as found for the optical resonance of the high anisotropy system ( lower solid line ) .",
    "as for the easy direction case the distance between the optical and acoustical resonance field @xmath30 is reduced by temperature .",
    "the last point is of special interest for symmetric systems .",
    "recall that for zero temperature as well as within the classical approach@xcite the distance between the optical and acoustical field @xmath30 is solely determined by the interlayer coupling strength .",
    "this feature , however , is lost at finite temperatures . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the distance shrinks faster for the high anisotropy system @xmath131 than for the system with lower anisotropy @xmath132 , irrespective of the same interlayer coupling strength .",
    "thus the field distance @xmath30 depends on both , on the interlayer coupling strength as well as on the anisotropies .",
    "note that for finite temperatures this holds even for symmetric systems , i.e. systems with equivalent magnetic films .",
    "this behavior is not reproduced by the classical theory@xcite . for the asymmetric system",
    "the temperature dependence is comparable to those of the high anisotropy system .",
    "furthermore the temperature dependence of the distance between the optical and acoustical field @xmath30 is slightly enhanced for higher coupling strengths ( open squares ) .",
    "+ let us summarize our findings for the coupled bilayer system :    * there are two uniform modes belonging to the acoustical and optical spin wave branch for the coupled bilayer system . for equivalent layers and at @xmath110",
    "the mode distance @xmath125 is a measure for the interlayer coupling strength . * both modes and the respective resonance fields",
    "are shifted towards the paramagnetic solution with increasing temperature .",
    "the magnitude of these shifts is determined by the distance of the respective mode from the paramagnetic line .",
    "the distance between the optical and acoustical mode @xmath125 and the distance between the resonance fields @xmath30 are reduced by temperature .",
    "* the magnitudes of these reductions are found to be larger for systems with a larger anisotropy strength .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resonance frequencies and fields is reflected in the temperature dependence of the effective interlayer coupling @xmath1 if the latter is obtained from experiment .",
    "it is clear that the effective interlayer coupling @xmath1 decreases if the temperature is enhanced .",
    "the magnitude of this decrease , however , may depend on the anisotropies of the film and is larger for larger anisotropies .",
    "note that this behavior is exclusively due to the contribution of spin wave interactions to the temperature dependence of the uniform mode .",
    "commonly there are two methods used to evaluat fmr experiments , namely a method based on an expansion of the free energy@xcite or a method based on the equation of motion for the classical magnetization vector.@xcite both techniques use a classical continuum model . in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative method based on an extended microscopic heisenberg model .",
    "the theoretical treatment of this model was shown to give excellent results for arbritrary directions of the external field.@xcite this new approach allows for an explicit consideration of temperature as far as magnetic excitations are concerned .",
    "we used the theory to make general predictions about the temperature dependence of the fmr frequencies and fields caused by magnetic excitations .",
    "additionally the results of the new method were compared to results of the classical model . a single film as well as an interlayer coupled bilayer system were considered .",
    "we found the following results :    * for zero temperature the results of the new method are very similar to those of the classical model for many parameter settings .",
    "there is however an important difference in the hard direction : the resonance frequency stays finite for all external fields for positive lattice anisotropies , while the classical model predicts a vanishing resonance frequency at the reorientation field .",
    "that is why the classical model can not explain the absence of a resonance field in the hard direction which was , however , observed experimentally for some systems.@xcite using the microscopic analysis this observation turns out to be the natural consequence of the finite frequency minimum in the dispersion relation ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for large anisotropy parameters",
    "the probe frequency is lower than the minimal resonance frequency and no resonance field can be detected any more .",
    "* for the coupled bilayer system two modes are found . for @xmath110 and equivalent",
    "magnetic layers the distance between the modes is solely determined by the interlayer coupling strength . for a system with non - equivalent layers",
    "the mode distance depends on the interlayer coupling as well as on the asymmetry of the film system . *",
    "the resonance frequencies and fields have a significant temperature dependence .",
    "the dispersion relation looks qualitatively similar for temperatures below @xmath113 .",
    "the frequency for zero external field as well as the minimum of the dispersion relation are shifted to lower values with increasing @xmath112 .",
    "this effects are similar , but not equivalent , to a reduction of the anisotropy parameter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for temperatures in the vicinity or above @xmath113 the shape of",
    "the dispersion relation changes drastically compared to @xmath110 . * with increasing temperature the resonance frequencies and fields",
    "are shifted towards the paramagnetic solution .",
    "this applies for the optical as well as for the acoustical branch and causes a decrease of the distance between the optical and acoustical mode @xmath125 as well as of the distance between the respective resonance fields @xmath30 .",
    "however , the paramagnetic solution is not reached at @xmath113 since the external field induces a finite magnetization above @xmath113 . * for symmetric films",
    "the behavior of @xmath30 is noteworthy . at @xmath110",
    "it is solely determined by the interlayer coupling strength @xmath9 .",
    "however , the anisotropy parameters do influence the temperature dependence of @xmath30 .",
    "the latter decreases faster with temperature for larger anisotropies .",
    "this qualitatively different behavior of the mode distance for zero and finite temperatures can not be described by the classical approach .",
    "these are the trends concerning the temperature dependence of the fmr signals due to the interaction of spin waves .",
    "+ furthermore we expect valuable insights , if our model is used to analyze temperature dependent fmr measurements .",
    "concerning the temperature dependence of the interlayer exchange coupling this method can be used to separate the different mechanisms which are known to be present in such systems , namely the spacer effect due to a smearing out of the fermi surface within the spacer and the magnetic effect caused by the excitation and interaction of spin waves .",
    "the relevance of both effects is intensively discussed in literature but a separation and thus a direct comparison of both effects was not possible up to now .",
    "such calculations are intended for the future .",
    "additionally the procedure can be used to analyze temperature dependent fmr measurements of anisotropy parameters.@xcite again the temperature dependence due to spin waves can be separated from other sources of temperature dependence which opens the possibility to gain a deeper understanding of anisotropy effects , too .",
