    "the aircraft was required to follow the flight trajectory given in figure [ fig : chap6_activeftc_reftraj ] ( note : wind effects have been taken into account using the dryden wind model in matlab ) .",
    "figure [ fig : chap6_activeftc_faultflag ] presents the fault detection logic for each scenario .",
    "there was no fault present in scenario 1 and this is reflected in the results of the fault detection logic as the value of the fault flag remained zero throughout the duration of the flight .",
    "the results for scenarios 2 and 3 show that the fault flag is triggered ( ie .",
    "the value of the flag switches to 1 ) within seconds of the fault occurring .",
    "the control inputs produced by the controller for each scenario are given in figures [ fig : chap6_activeftc_controls_nf ] , [ fig : chap6_activeftc_controls_50 t ] and [ fig : chap6_activeftc_controls_30 t ] .",
    "the results clearly indicate that the controller is able to successfully reconfigure based on fdi data and as the loss of power increases the demand on the elevator increases .",

    "the demanded speed was @xmath10 and the results show that for a @xmath8 loss in power the true airspeed demand is unachievable during climb to altitude .",
    "however during straight and level flight the velocity demand is gradually achieved and is finally reached once the aircraft begins the descent phase . during the descent",
    "the true airspeed demand is similar to the no fault case . in the case of @xmath9 power loss",
    "the aircraft is unable to meet the true airspeed demand during straight and level flight , however halfway through the descent phase the aircraft picks up speed and is able to maintain the reference . in any given scenario stall speed is never reached .    .",
    "stall speed did not occur in any scenario . ]",
    "the climb rate ( or vertical speed ) response is shown in figures [ fig : chap6_activeftc_controls_vd ] and [ fig : chap6_activeftc_controls_vd_subs ] and shows that during power loss the vertical speed oscillates between the upper and lower constraints values .",
    "this is to be expected as the elevator is working harder to regulate the speed , and hence bounces between the two limits .    ]    ]    finally the trajectories flown by the aircraft in each scenario are shown in figure [ fig : chap6_activeftc_controls_height ] .",
    "the interesting points to note here are that in the highest loss of power case ( scenario 3 ) the aircraft did not have enough power to reach the highest flight altitude so instead cruised at an altitude it was capable of flying . once the straight and level phase of the flight was over the controller was able to fly the aircraft back onto the demanded trajectory .",
    "the @xmath8 loss of power case shows that aircraft still had enough power to fly back onto the demanded path halfway through the straight and level at altitude flight phase .",
    "in this paper we demonstrated the successful application of an nmpc based active ftc design on an actual uav which is currently in operation .",
    "the controller was implemented using actual aircraft data and shows great promise for active fault tolerant flight control .",
