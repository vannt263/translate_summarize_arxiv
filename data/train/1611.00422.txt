    "the extremely large telescopes ( elt)the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , and the giant magellan telescope ( gmt)will reach unprecedented depths at optical and infrared wavelengths and have unprecedented spatial resolutions on account of their enormous apertures . to fully exploit the potential `` @xmath2 '' benefit of these facilities , taking advantage of both depth and resolution , requires adaptive optics ( ao ; see @xcite for a comprehensive review ; see @xcite for discussion relating to tmt and @xcite for discussion relating to e - elt ) .",
    "this technology improves the strehl ratio of the point - spread function ( psf ) , a measurement of the peak of the psf relative to the theoretical diffraction - limited value .",
    "it does this by correcting the wavefront distortions in the science light caused by the atmosphere .",
    "adaptive optics has a better performance at longer wavelengths and so they generally operate at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .    in classic adaptive optics ,",
    "optical aberrations are first measured in the direction of a point - like source above the turbulence by using a wavefront sensor .",
    "natural guide stars ( ngs ) are the best sources to use since they are distant and point - like",
    ". however , there can be not enough suitable ( i.e. , bright ) ngss in a given field of view , leading to the use of artificial laser guide star ( lgs ) .",
    "these are created by a laser beam launched from the proximity of the telescope in the direction of the science target .",
    "a return of photons toward the telescope aperture is produced by either rayleigh scattering from molecules in the atmosphere or by excitement of sodium atoms at high altitudes . since the lgs wavefront sensors are blind to the tip - tilt aberration @xcite , ngss are still necessary but they can be fainter because they are required only to determine tip and tilt .",
    "a control system acquires the data from the wavefront sensors and calculates the correction that the ao system has to apply .",
    "a deformable mirror then injects an equal and opposite distortion to correct the image .",
    "the main shortcoming of classical ao is the limited size of the corrected field , typically of the order of a few arcseconds .",
    "a single guide star can probe only the cylinder of atmosphere in its direction ; the more distant a target is from it , the less the guide star probes the relevant aberrations and so the less effective the correction .",
    "this effect , known as anisoplanatism , is improved by multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) . here , multiple guide stars are employed to probe the atmosphere in different directions and reconstruct the atmospheric distortion in a larger volume .",
    "multiple deformable mirrors , optically conjugated to different altitudes , apply the correction to the layers of turbulence associated to those heights . while an mcao system can work using only ngss , such as the mcao demonstrator mad on vlt @xcite ,",
    "the use of lgss is advantageous because it alleviates the requirements for an asterism of bright stars close to the scientific target , thus increasing significantly the sky coverage .",
    "the gemini multi - conjugate adaptive optics system ( gems ) on gemini south is the first facility class mcao instrument , and had first light in 2012 .",
    "high resolution imaging of extended crowded stellar fields has generally been a prerogative of space telescopes , but gems now routinely enables this capability from the ground .",
    "we have observed the galactic globular clusters ngc 1851 , ngc 2808 , ngc 5904 , ngc 6652 , ngc 6681 , and ngc 6723 in the j and k@xmath0 bands .",
    "these clusters were selected as southern hemisphere targets which had preexisting , high quality , space - based imaging from the hst acs survey of galactic globular clusters of @xcite .",
    "first results for ngc 1851 are presented in @xcite and results for ngc 2808 and ngc 6681 are published in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the study of their stellar populations and dynamics , a major goal of our observing program is to better understand how best to exploit mcao data for precision photometry and astrometry , in order to prepare for science observations with the elts .",
    "the large number of relatively bright point sources distributed over the field of view allows our globular clusters to be used as a training ground for measurement techniques on mcao data .",
    "the success of mcao as a technology relies on its ability to produce science - ready astronomical measurements  particularly photometry and astrometry  and so it is important to use science - based metrics to judge the success or otherwise of any techniques .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the critical question of how to extract the most precise photometry from mcao data , using our observations of ngc 1851 . like most globular clusters ,",
    "ngc 1851 has a thin main sequence and giant branch but has a split subgiant branch @xcite .",
    "examination of the quality of the color magnitude diagrams will allow us to determine the utility of the strategies that we employ to obtain the photometry . while our conclusions are specifically valid for gems , they are also expected to be of relevance for any mcao dataset , and it is our expectation that such studies will prove useful for the development of the mcao systems and observing strategies for the tmt and e - elt .",
    "a subsequent contribution will present similar details for astrometric measurements , noting that the capacity of gems to produce precise astrometry has already been shown in @xcite .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows : section  [ sec : observations ] discusses the details of our observations of ngc 1851 ; section  [ sec : images ] presents a summary of the image processing ; section  [ sec : performance ] overviews the photometric performance of gems / gsaoi , especially regarding the uniformity of the shape of the psf ; section  [ sec : photometry ] presents an overview of our photometric analysis procedure and a detailed discussion of the steps taken to optimize the process to obtain the most precise photometry ; section  [ sec : cmds ] presents our final color - magnitude diagrams and a brief discussion of their most prominent features ; section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarises our main conclusions .",
    "gems , the gemini multi - conjugate adaptive optics system @xcite , is the first facility - class mcao system .",
    "it started science operations at the end of 2012 on the 8-meter gemini south telescope on cerro pachn ( chile ) .",
    "it measures the aberrations caused by the volume of atmosphere in the direction of the observed field using five laser beams , tuned to the sodium d2 line at 589 nm , that are launched from the back of the secondary mirror . by exciting the layer of atmospheric neutral sodium at 90100 km @xcite ,",
    "the system generates five lgss arranged in a 60 square asterism with the fifth star in the center .",
    "a wavefront sensor ( wfs ) for each lgs measures the wavefront distortions along these five directions .",
    "since the lgs wfss are blind to tip - tilt aberrations @xcite , 13 bright natural guide stars ( ngss ) are required to determine this low - order mode , each with their own wfs .",
    "all wavefront measurements are combined to calculate the commands given to the deformable mirrors that provide the correction .",
    "the two deformable mirrors are optically conjugated to 0 and 8.5 km to correct for the turbulence at the ground and at high altitudes , respectively .",
    "the corrected wavefront is imaged by gsaoi , the gemini south adaptive optics imager @xcite .",
    "this camera has four teledyne hawaii-2rg nir detectors @xcite arranged in a 2 x 2 array , each chip with 2040 x 2040 active pixels .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.0196px@xmath3 and the total field of view is 82.5 x 82.5 ( with a gap of 2.5 between the chips ) .",
    "the detectors are read out using fowler sampling @xcite , which consists of a series of nondestructive reads of the pixels at the beginning and at the end of each exposure . the two sets are averaged and their difference constitutes the signal accumulated .",
    "the larger the number of samples taken , the lower the read noise .    during the gems / gsaoi science verification period",
    ", we observed the galactic globular cluster ngc 1851 ( 05@xmath414@xmath506@xmath6.76 , -400247.6 ) with the nir broad band filters j ( @xmath7 ) and k@xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) on the nights of 2012 december 31 , 2013 january 27 , and 2013 january 30 ( gemini program gs-2012b - sv-406 , pi : mcconnachie ) .",
    "sub - exposures of 160 seconds were used and dithered in a pattern of 3 steps to cover the gap between the four chips ( figure  [ fig : dithering ] ) .",
    "seventeen exposures were taken in the j band and twelve in the k@xmath0 .",
    "two shorter exposures were also taken in each band to obtain non - saturated photometry of the brightest stars .",
    "table  [ tab : exposures ] provides a summary of our exposures .",
    "we used the `` faint object '' read mode with four fowler samples per set ( read noise of 13.6 @xmath9 ) .",
    "three natural guide stars in the field of view have been used for the tip - tilt correction , with magnitudes of 13.3 , 13.7 , and 14.4 in the r band . unfortunately , reliable measurements of the seeing conditions at the telescope site during our individual observations were not recorded .",
    "however , measurements made on cerro tololo by the ctio robodimm indicate relatively poor seeing conditions , with median values of approximately 1.1 and 0.8 when taking the j and k@xmath0 exposures , respectively .",
    "one of the j band images ( exposure # 10 ) has not been used in the data analysis because of its particularly poor mcao correction .",
    "a single k@xmath0 band exposure is shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] with the positions of the natural and laser guide stars highlighted .",
    "the same pattern was used for the 17 j band long exposures , with 5 of the pointings repeated.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    .observing log of ngc 1851 with gems [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      exposure of 160 seconds of ngc 1851 with gems / gsaoi .",
    "the orange star symbols show the position of the five lgss .",
    "the three ngss used are circled in red.[fig : mosaic],scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "prior to performing the photometric analysis , we process the raw images with the gemini / gsaoi iraf package correcting for bad pixels , linearity and flat fielding .",
    "* _ bad pixels  _ the gsaoi detector has a large number of both dead and bright pixels .",
    "the defective elements have been flagged using the bad pixel map provided by the gemini iraf package .",
    "most of the hot pixels also cause an uncorrected leak of signal towards adjacent pixels that have lower counts , producing a `` cross - like '' pattern as shown in figure  [ fig : capac ] .",
    "these are evident especially in the j band exposures due to the lower sky emission .",
    "this effect is caused by inter - pixel capacitance @xcite , an additional voltage on a pixel during its reading that is generated by the large difference in collected charges with respect to an adjacent one .",
    "* _ linearity  _ hawaii-2rg chips deviate appreciably at high signal levels from a linear response because of the change in the reverse bias voltage caused by the accumulated charges @xcite . to compensate for this behavior ,",
    "the values of every pixel are corrected with a quadratic polynomial whose coefficients were measured during the gsaoi commissioning @xcite . * _ flat field  _ to create our flat fields in each band , we first produced a master dome flat and a master twilight flat by median - combing individual exposures using average sigma clipping .",
    "the dome flats have the benefit of a high signal to noise , although their spectral signature and uniformity is inferior to the sky flats .",
    "the latter are therefore preferred but also have a lower signal to noise than the dome flats .",
    "thus , we combine the dome and twilight master flats together to create a `` super '' flat in the following way .",
    "we first divide the master twilight by the master dome and we apply on the result a top - hat median circular filter to keep only the large - scale spatial variation .",
    "this creates a low - pass filtered image that is then multiplied by the dome master flat that has information on the pixel - to - pixel difference in response .",
    "the resulting `` super '' flat has the high signal - to - noise of the dome exposures and the uniform illumination and spectral signature of the twilight exposures , making it our choice for the flat fielding of the science exposures .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we note that the detectors have a very low dark current ( 0.01 @xmath9 s@xmath3 px@xmath3 ) .",
    "the scale of this effect is of the order of one electron per pixel in our longest exposures ; hence , no dark frame has been subtracted .",
    "we also highlight that we do not apply sky frames .",
    "the focus of our analysis is point source photometry and , on the spatial scale of a psf , the flux from the sky is expected to be constant .",
    "applying a sky frame introduces additional systematic uncertainties and contributes to the photon noise .",
    "instead , we evaluate the sky at the position of each star using an annulus around them during the profile fitting , as discussed in section  [ sec : photometry ] .",
    "an example region ( 4 x 3.3 ) of one of the k@xmath0 exposures before and after processing is shown in figure  [ fig : iraf ] .",
    "the purpose of mcao is to provide diffraction - limited imaging over the largest field of view possible . in the case of a perfect correction",
    ", the psfs across the field would have the same size , shape , and flux concentration .",
    "globular clusters provide an ideal testing ground of mcao systems in this regard , with a large number of stars to examine .",
    "we now characterize the quality and stability of the mcao correction in our exposures to inform the more detailed photometric measurements that are described in section  [ sec : photometry ] .",
    "we use the large number of bright and isolated psf stars ( see discussion in section  [ sec : psfestimate ] ) , distributed across the field of view .",
    "we subtract all other stars from the images ( using the technique described in section  [ sec : photometry ] ) and we apply a median filter on the bad pixels to remove them from the images .",
    "an example of a stellar image is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : interp ] .",
    "the stellar images are then interpolated onto a finer grid by zero - padding their fourier transform by a factor of 3 , an example of which is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : interp ] .",
    "the strehl ratio ( sr ) is the ratio of the peak flux of the actual psf to the peak flux of the diffraction - limited psf . to measure it",
    ", we adopt the peak value of the interpolated image as the peak of the psf .",
    "the diffraction - limited psf is generated by the fourier transform of the gemini south telescope aperture , which we model as a circle with a diameter of 8.1 m and a central circular obstruction of 1 m. we omit the spider of the secondary mirror since the change in the psf peak by including this more complex structure is negligible .",
    "the diffraction peak is normalized to the flux of the star using the instrumental magnitudes measured by psf fitting by the techniques in section  [ sec : photometry ] .",
    "however , the psf model we use here has a radius of 45 pixels that is larger than the radius used in section  [ sec : psfrad ] this is so that we include in each measurement the majority of flux from the star ( see figure  [ fig : psfradstat ] ) .",
    "this improves the accuracy of the flux , at a cost to the precision , by avoiding larger systematic errors .",
    "we provide a simple quantification of the two dimensional shape of the psf by fitting an ellipse to the contour that defines the half - maximum of the psf .",
    "an illustration of this is shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig : interp ] .",
    "the fwhm is then defined from the geometric mean of the semi - major ( @xmath10 ) and semi - minor ( @xmath11 ) axes , such that fwhm @xmath12 , and the ellipticity is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "we also measure the position angle of each ellipse .",
    "this allows us to create spatial performance maps of the mcao correction , an example of which is shown in figure  [ fig : spline ] for one of the long k@xmath0 exposures ( exposure 10 ) .",
    "the left panel shows the distribution of raw sr measurements for each of the psf stars .",
    "note that there is a lack of psf stars in the central region of the image due to extreme crowding .",
    "the right panel shows the same performance map but interpolated across the full field using a smoothing spline and shown as a contour map .",
    "the average values of the fwhm , strehl ratio , and ellipticity of each long exposure image for both the j and k@xmath0 bands are shown in figure  [ fig : perfstats ] .",
    "these exposures are numbered sequentially in the order that they were taken .",
    "the average fwhm in the j band is @xmath14 and in the k@xmath0 band is @xmath15 . for the strehl ratio ,",
    "the average value for the j band is @xmath16 , whereas for the k@xmath0 band it is @xmath17 .",
    "it is expected that adaptive optics performs in k@xmath0 band better than in j since the aberrated wavefront has a larger spatial and temporal coherence at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "bands ( blue and red , respectively ) .",
    "the diffraction - limit fwhm values are shown in the top panel for comparison .",
    "we have not analyzed exposure # 10 in the j band due to a particularly poor mcao correction .",
    "these exposures are numbered sequentially in the order they were observed ; all k@xmath0 band exposures were observed on the same night , whereas the j band exposures were observed on two different nights , with the first ten observed on the first night.[fig : perfstats],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   bands ( blue and red , respectively ) .",
    "the diffraction - limit fwhm values are shown in the top panel for comparison .",
    "we have not analyzed exposure # 10 in the j band due to a particularly poor mcao correction .",
    "these exposures are numbered sequentially in the order they were observed ; all k@xmath0 band exposures were observed on the same night , whereas the j band exposures were observed on two different nights , with the first ten observed on the first night.[fig : perfstats],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   bands ( blue and red , respectively ) .",

    "the first three panels show the interpolated maps of the fwhm , sr , and ellipticity .",
    "the fourth panel indicates the shape of each fwhm ellipse , where the angle of the dash indicates the position angle and the length indicates the ellipticity ( short dashes are more circular ellipses and thus the position angle is not as well measured as for longer dashes ) . in all four panels ,",
    "it is clear that the performance is relatively uniform but certainly not constant across the field . in line with expectations ,",
    "the best values of fwhm and sr are near the center of the lgs asterism .",
    "but we also notice that the shape of the psf , described by its ellipticity , has a more complex spatial pattern and does not perform better in the center ( thus our best exposure has smaller but more elliptical psfs in the center of the asterism compared to elsewhere ) .",
    "indeed , we find that the behavior of the ellipticity and position angles varies abruptly in consecutive exposures , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : elliptmaps ] for three consecutive k@xmath0 band exposures .",
    "note that this does not correlate with the movement of the ngs asterism caused by the dithering of the telescope .",
    "one of the main problems in delivering a better performance was the incorrect conjugation in altitude of the optical elements in the lgs wavefront sensors , as documented in a gemini observatory internal report ( g. sivo , private communication ) .",
    "this was identified and corrected in the year after our observations .",
    "despite these few issues , our mcao observations show a substantial improvement from seeing - limited images .",
    "our estimation of the performance of gems are consistent with previous findings @xcite .",
    "we now demonstrate that they can produce unprecedented levels of photometric precision in a crowded field from the ground .",
    "it is well know that precision photometry in a crowded stellar field can not be achieved by aperture photometry due to crowding , where starlight from one star compromises the measurement of the flux of any nearby star .",
    "a more robust method is profile fitting photometry , especially if the psf can be estimated empirically on the images .",
    "this is the case for our observations of ngc 1851 , where we have a large number of bright point - like sources in every part of the field of view . for the ensuing photometric analysis we have used the daophot ii suite of programs @xcite .",
    "we begin by providing a broad overview of the process that we use to obtain our photometry prior to discussing how certain critical stages of our analysis are optimized for best performance .        * the stars are first detected ( using the find routine ) by convolving each individual image with a truncated gaussian profile , lowered to have a zero integral and that has a fwhm similar to that of the real psf . local maxima in the convolved images are identified as stars if they are above a chosen noise threshold ( @xmath18 for j and @xmath19 for k@xmath0 ) and within a range of `` sharpness '' and `` roundness '' parameters , selected to discriminate a star from extended objects , cosmic rays or artifacts of the detector . * for each catalog corresponding to each of the original images , we transform the coordinate system to a master frame of reference ( using the daomaster program ) .",
    "the master frame is defined by the seeing - limited catalog used for the photometric calibration ( section [ sec : calibration ] ) . a polynomial transformation of order 3",
    "* we additionally stack the long exposure images ( using montage ) by assigning to each pixel of the stacked image the median value of its nearest pixel from each of the transformed frames , and identifying all sources ( using find ) . while the resulting image has a larger psf than any of the single exposures ( due to the different psfs of each image , see section  [ sec : performance ] , and the nearest - pixel approach instead of interpolation ) , these stacked images allow us to detect and measure a large number of faint stars that are not detected in the individual exposures ( figure  [ fig : stack ] ) . * the master catalog is created in each band by combining all detections found in each of the short exposures , the stacked images , and in at least three of the dithered long exposures .",
    "the short exposures are primarily used to find the brightest unsaturated stars , the stacked images are primarily for the faintest stars , and the long exposures are for all the other sources , with the requirement of three independent detections to remove most spurious objects .",
    "* we select 500 `` psf stars '' in the entire field of view , approximately 90 in each quadrant of the detector ( left panel of figure  [ fig : psf_stars ] ) , that are used to model the psf independently for every chip of every exposure .",
    "these are stars that are bright but not saturated and that do not have obvious close companions .",
    "they are chosen to be distributed as uniformly as possible across the observed field of view , except in the cluster core where many saturated stars cause large flux gradients that render reliable background estimates difficult .",
    "the significant number of psf stars ensures that the photon noise in the psf model is reduced and that systematic effects on individual psf stars ( such as detector cosmetics or contamination from unrecognized companion stars ) are minimized .",
    "a constant background is estimated for each psf star as the modal value of the pixels in a surrounding annulus and is then subtracted from each psf star .",
    "we choose the inner edge of this sky region to start from the pixel immediately outside the psf model and the outer edge to contain approximately 2000 pixels in the annulus . *",
    "the psf is modeled in two parts .",
    "the first component is a simple analytic function , for which we have chosen a lorentzian .",
    "the second component is a two dimensional grid of empirical corrections calculated from the residuals of the psf stars after subtracting the analytic component .",
    "this look - up table can be set to have either the same values everywhere in the field of view or to vary spatially . in the spatially varying case ,",
    "each element of the table is associated with a set of coefficients that describe a bivariate polynomial in x and y , the position on the field of view . in section  [",
    "sec : performance ] , we demonstrated that there is significant spatial variation in the psf in our images , and so we have chosen to use a cubic polynomial , the highest degree of variability available in daophot . the possibility to calculate such a high variability",
    "is given by the large number of psf stars available in the images .",
    "photometric measurements are obtained for objects in each image , including the stacked images , by fitting the appropriate psf model to each object in the master source catalog ( using allstar ) .",
    "at each iteration , the flux of a star is calculated by first subtracting the profiles of its neighbors using their positions and magnitudes derived from the previous iteration ( starting with estimates from aperture photometry ) . the star s background ( as estimated from the previous iteration ) is then subtracted and the instrumental magnitude is measured by fitting the psf model to the star s central pixels within three fwhma , where the s / n is higher .",
    "the sky beneath the star is then updated by removing the star itself and measuring the values in an annulus starting at two pixels from the peak ( to avoid the large residuals of the core ) out to the edge of the psf model .      the photometric calibration of the instrumental magnitudes is performed with respect to the 2mass photometric system .",
    "however , we have had to use an auxiliary catalog to connect our observations to the 2mass point source catalog , since the latter has only about 150 stars in the field and most of them are too bright for our exposures .",
    "this auxiliary catalog has been obtained by one of the authors ( pbs ) from 256 seeing - limited archival images of ngc 1851 ( median fwhm of 1.32 ) taken with the newfirm instrument on the blanco telescope on cerro tololo ( chile ) , and has a depth intermediate between our gemini images and the 2mass catalog . by matching the stars in the auxiliary catalog to the corresponding stars in our gemini dataset",
    ", we are able to determine the zeropoints of each chip in each exposure in both bands by using the technique described in section  [ sec : calibration ] .",
    "the final step is to clean the calibrated j and k@xmath0 catalogs of spurious objects , extended objects , or poor photometry . to do this",
    ", we use the various photometric parameters calculated by daophot .",
    "specifically , we use : @xmath20 , the goodness of the photometric fit that is measured by the ratio between the fitting residuals and the expected scatter caused by noise only ; sharpness , which is derived from the difference in width between the object and the psf ( objects that are too small are usually bad pixels or cosmic rays , objects that are too large are usually galaxies ) ; the magnitude error , which is a combination of the estimated random noise and the fitting residuals ( weighted toward the bigger of the two ) .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig : cmdclean ] show the cuts applied to these three parameters in both bands .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : cmdclean ] shows the two dimensional distribution of the difference in position of matched objects between the two bands .",
    "we remove from the final catalog those stars with more than 0.01 of discrepancy , corresponding to half a pixel .",
    "thus , our final catalog contains only high quality detections in both bands .",
    "the preceding subsection provided a high level overview of the methodology for obtaining the final photometry from our processed images .",
    "we have followed a standard procedure for psf photometry that has been implemented on optical and near ir observations of stellar fields for many years .",
    "however , science quality mcao observations of crowded fields are a relatively new capability and a major focus of this work has been to understand what modifications and subtleties are required at various stages in the process to have confidence that the final photometry is optimal .",
    "in particular , our analysis in section  [ sec : performance ] demonstrates that the images still have significant distortions present that change the shape of the psf across the field and between exposures in a complex fashion .",
    "what follows is a discussion of what we have identified as critical steps and decisions in the method described in the previous subsection , to obtain the highest quality photometry . specifically :    1 .",
    "size of the psf model 2 .",
    "variability of the psf 3 .",
    "selection of the sky annuli 4 .   minimizing contamination light in the psf",
    "stars 5 .",
    "independent profile fitting    most of these items are judged by science - based metrics based on the quality of the final color magnitude diagram , instead of using parameters like fwhm and strehl ratio that are difficult to measure and do not translate easily into an impact for the science .",
    "calibration is discussed independently in section  [ sec : calibration ] . in this discussion",
    "we show results stemming from the analysis in the k@xmath0 band , but we note similar results with the j filter .      the psf model in daophot is defined within a radius ( termed the `` psf radius '' ) measured from the centroid . in the case of no variation in the psf across the field , this aperture will contain the same fraction of flux for every star . in this way ,",
    "the flux measured within the psf radius for each star can be translated into a total flux via an additional term in the photometric zeropoint measured during the calibration ( section  [ sec : calibration ] ) . in the case of a spatially variable psf ,",
    "the psf radius should ideally contain most of the spatially variable component , so that the flux within the aperture is still a constant fraction of the total .",
    "ideally , the psf radius should also be large enough to include most of the real psf . in this way , when the star is subtracted during the profile fitting",
    ", all its flux is removed from the image and it does nt contaminate the profile of nearby stars .",
    "most of the spatial variability in the psf of mcao images is caused by an inhomegeneous correction applied over the field of view .",
    "the maximum spatial frequency of the aberrated wavefront that an mcao system can correct is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pitch of the highest density of actuators in the deformable mirrors projected on to the aperture of the telescope . for gems it is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the mcao system behaves as a high - pass filter for the wavefront , such that only light within the `` control radius '' , @xmath24 , of any psf is affected by the correction , leaving the wings of the profile mostly unchanged with respect to the seeing - limited psf .",
    "since the actuators are actually arranged on a square grid , the psf region influenced by the adaptive optics for gems is a square with a side of @xmath25 . for gems ,",
    "@xmath26 in k@xmath0 band and the psf radius used for our images should therefore , in principle , be at least this value .",
    "examination of a typical psf in our images suggests that this argument is valid .",
    "figure  [ fig : rad ] presents an example of a stellar radial profile from our data .",
    "the left panel shows the two dimensional image , with the centroid marked by the green cross and a blue square superimposed with sides of @xmath27 . shown for reference is also a circle with a radius of 50 pixels .",
    "the right panel shows the radial profile of the psf , where each dot corresponds to a pixel in the image .",
    "firstly , we see that the profile does not level off to a constant value until around 50 pixels .",
    "secondly , the spread in the profile at small radius is significant and increases with decreasing radius .",
    "this is to be expected if the psf is significantly distorted ( e.g. , has significant ellipticity ) .",
    "as the inset panel shows , however , the spread in the points becomes broadly constant at a radius greater than 2122 pixels .",
    "this is in line with expectations from our argument above and confirms that the asymmetric part of the psf is mostly within the control radius .",
    "we have tested the effect of modifying the psf radius on the resulting photometry from our images .",
    "we have produced several different photometric catalogs , where each version uses a different value for the psf radius .",
    "all other steps in the photometric analysis are identical .",
    "we have combined the resulting instrumental magnitudes with the high precision photometry from the hst / acs catalogue of ngc 1851 in the v band ( f606w ) presented in @xcite . since this catalog is extremely precise , examination of the relative quality of the resulting optical - nir cmds",
    "allows us to develop a science based metric to judge the quality of our nir photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : psfradcmd ] shows the cmds corresponding to each version of our k@xmath0 photometry ( a similar analysis was made for the j band ) .",
    "we use the width of the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) , in the region where the sequence is nearly vertical , as a metric on the quality of the photometry .",
    "we quantify the width of this sequence via the fwhm of a gaussian curve fitted to the histogram of the color distribution of the stars .",
    "photometric errors and systematics will act to increase the measured width of the main sequence , even in the presence of multiple populations ( as is the case for ngc 1851 , see section  [ sec : cmds ] ) , thus higher quality photometry will produce a smaller fwhm .",
    "we note that figure  [ fig : psfradcmd ] uses uncalibrated k@xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "therefore , each cmd is shifted horizontally with respect to the others since the instrumental magnitudes are `` fainter '' when a smaller psf radius is used .",
    "the histograms in figure  [ fig : psfradcmd ] demonstrate that the width of the msto in the cmd is minimized for psf radii of @xmath28 ( a psf radius of 24 pixels also appears to produce a narrower red giant branch ) .",
    "we find that this result holds for all exposures , independent of the quality of the ao correction applied .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that the optimal psf model radius for our analysis is close to the value of the control radius @xmath29 , which itself is considerably smaller than the `` overall '' size of the psf .",
    "figure  [ fig : psfradstat ] plots the uncalibrated color of the msto as a function of the psf radius , and it is clear that the color does not change significantly ( i.e. , the instrumental k@xmath0 magnitude is constant ) for a psf radius between 40 and 50 pixels ; this value is also consistent with our discussion relating to figure  [ fig : rad ] .     image .",
    "the width of the sequence is represented by the error bars.[fig : psfradstat],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the flux outside the control radius is the same fraction for every star since all the variability in the shape of the psf is interior to this value . moreover",
    ", at large radii , where the intrinsic flux from the star is low , contamination due to noise , cosmic rays , and nearby stars can be significant ( for example , note the presence of several structures at large radii from the center of the bright star shown in figure  [ fig : rad ] ) .",
    "adoption of a large psf radius means that these spurious structures are considered part of the psf model , leading to an overall reduction in the precision of the photometry .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : psfs ] , where the first panel shows the psf of a star observed in the k@xmath0 filter .",
    "the second and third panels are the two psf models for this star , where the former adopts a psf radius of 24 pixels and the latter a radius of 40 pixels .",
    "the latter model has a large amount of small scale structure at large radii that are not intrinsic to the halo , expected to be smooth for these long exposure times .",
    "thus , a psf radius close to the control radius is large enough to include all the variability of the psf but small enough to exclude the majority of spurious structure , leading to more precise photometry .",
    "an unwanted side effect of using a smaller value of the psf radius is that when a star is subtracted from the image during the profile fitting , it leaves an `` orphan '' halo with a hole in the center where the core of the psf was .",
    "the inner edge of the halo of a bright star looks like a doughnut , as shown in figure  [ fig : halo ] .",
    "this discontinuity in brightness can lead to spurious detections , as is visible in figure  [ fig : halo ] .",
    "however , these spurious detections are easily identified and removed from the final catalog during the quality control phase ( section  [ sec : quality ] ) .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=30.0% ]      in seeing - limited and space - based images , the psf is generally uniform across the field .",
    "any variability that does exist is usually a result of static and quasi - static distortions introduced by the optics , with no significant variation between observations .",
    "in contrast , in mcao data the psf can present a complex spatial and temporal variability in terms of size and overall shape , as demonstrated in section  [ sec : performance ] , especially figure  [ fig : elliptmaps ] .",
    "such distortions are much less over large fields than using classic ao but they still necessitate careful modeling to obtain accurate photometry .",
    "daophot uses for the psf a constant analytical function for all stars in combination with a two dimensional lookup table for the empirical corrections to create the model psf .",
    "each pixel in this grid can be set to have either the same values everywhere in the field of view or to vary spatially . in the spatially varying case ,",
    "each element of the grid is associated with a set of coefficients that together describe a bivariate polynomial in x and y , the coordinates of the star in the field .",
    "the polynomial can be up to the third order , making the psf vary linearly , quadratically or cubically .",
    "we also note that each grid element varies independently of every other one .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : psfvarsub ] shows examples of six psf stars in a k@xmath0 image from different parts of a frame .",
    "the other panels show the same regions after profiles with different variability have been fitted and subtracted .",
    "the constant and linear models present large residuals , while the quadratic and cubic seem to fit similarly well the profiles . to determine which produces the most accurate photometry , we have created uncalibrated cmds ( figure  [ fig : psfvarcmd ] ) as in section  [ sec : psfrad ] to analyze the width of their mstos .",
    "on all the tested images we find that the cubic variability has similar or slightly better performance than the quadratic , which is unsurprising given the large distortions of the psfs that we observed in section  [ sec : performance ] .      when testing the psf radius we have also modified two related sets of radii .",
    "the first is the annulus of pixels that we haveused to measure and remove the sky value of the psf stars , measured beyond the psf radius ( see section  [ sec : photometry ] ) .",
    "the second set is the annulus to calculate the sky during the profile fitting that is computed at every iteration after the profile subtraction and which is measured interior to the psf radius .",
    "the inner radius of this annulus is set at two pixels from the center to avoid the large residuals that could be near the peak .",
    "we have first tested the influence of the psf model s sky annulus on the photometry by varying its distance from the edge of the psf radius and its width .",
    "we have tried three annuli with inner and outer radii of [ 25 , 36 ] , [ 41 , 49 ] , and [ 25 , 49 ] , each of which include at least 2000 pixels to have a good signal .",
    "the first and third of these options measure the sky relatively close to where the psf is measured ( but with a larger area used in the latter option ) , whereas the second option measures the sky away from the psf to reduce any contribution to the flux from the psf star . using the same cmd dispersion criterion of section  [ sec : psfrad ]",
    ", we found no measurable change in the photometric precision for any of the three photometric catalogs .",
    "we therefore adopted the first of the three choices .    for the sky annulus used during profile fitting ,",
    "we have tested an outer radius of 16 , 20 , and 24 pixels . for most of the images in k@xmath0 filter ,",
    "the photometric precision does not measurably change .",
    "however , for the k@xmath0 exposures with poorer mcao correction and for all the j band exposures we tested , we find that a small outer radius is preferable , as is shown in figure  [ fig : psfskycmd ] . we have therefore adopted a sky annulus with an inner radius of 2 pixels and an outer radius of 16 pixels .",
    "we postulate that a small outer radius is preferred because , when the strehl ratio is lower , more faint stars are left undetected .",
    "a larger outer sky radius then increases the chances of these faint stars contributing to the `` sky '' measurement , reducing the accuracy of this measurement .      in a crowded image",
    ", the psf is inevitably going to be measured using stars that have their profiles contaminated by nearby sources , causing inaccuracies in its estimation ( for example , see the left panel of figure  [ fig : rad ] ) . to improve the resulting model , we have performed an iterative estimation of the psf .",
    "namely , we measure a first estimate of the psf on the crowded image ( first iteration ) and with it we subtract all the stars from the image except for the psf stars .",
    "we then use this `` cleaned '' image to redetermine a better psf ( second iteration ) . figure  [ fig : psf_stars ]",
    "shows an example of an original reduced frame and a `` cleaned '' one , where the psf stars are marked . by measuring the width of the msto in the usual way , we determine that there is a gain in photometric precision when using the psf estimated in the second iteration compared to the first ( figure  [ fig : psfitercmd ] ) .",
    "no benefit has been observed from increasing the number of iterations that we use beyond two .",
    "the allframe task in the daophot suite can perform the profile fitting photometry on multiple images at the same time . at each iteration",
    ", this program uses the geometric transformations of each frame on the master catalog to determine the position of the stars on the images .",
    "then the psf models are centered on these positions and are fitted to the image by subtracting the nearby stars determined in the previous iteration .",
    "the estimated residuals in the positions of the stars are minimized in the following iterations by adjusting both the stars positions in the master catalog and the coefficients of the geometric transformation . by fixing the positions of the stars in the reference frame for all the images ,",
    "the combined photometry is potentially more precise by reducing the uncertainty caused by the noise in positioning the fitted psf .    in figure",
    "[ fig : alsalf ] , the first panel shows a region of a k@xmath0 band image near the edge of the field .",
    "the middle panel shows the subtracted image once all the psfs have been fitted without placing constraints on their positions from the master catalog .",
    "the right panel shows the subtracted image where the positions of the stars are fixed using the allframe transformation .",
    "clearly , the latter image displays strong residuals caused by a similar misplacement of the psf centers .",
    "we note that the region selected for this example is one where the effect is particularly dramatic and that in most of the images it is more subtle . while not a focus of this paper , the resulting astrometry is also affected : figure  [ fig : alsalfpos ] shows the difference between the positions of psf stars in a k@xmath0 band image determined with the two methods .",

    "we note that allframe uses a polynomial fit of maximum third order .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that gems delivers a field of view with geometric distortions well described by a fifth order polynomial with an rms of about 0.01 px respect to the third order .",
    "for the exposure in figure  [ fig : alsalfpos ] , we find a median difference in positions of 0.03 px between no constrains and the third order .",
    "however , the difference between polynomials could be more severe near the edges . by relying on the daophot transformations",
    ", we are potentially producing differences between the real position on the image of the stars and where the psf is fitted by allframe .    by analyzing the test cmds for the two cases in the usual way ( figure  [ fig : alsalfcmd ] )",
    ", we do not find substantial differences around the msto between the two methods .",
    "however , to reduce astrometric systematic errors and eliminate residuals such as those in figure  [ fig : alsalf ] , we use the single - frame method in the profile fitting .        the instrumental magnitudes of stars measured in our data are calibrated to our reference catalog described in section  [ sec : calibrationover ] by applying a zeropoint ( @xmath30 ) and a color correction ( @xmath31 ) . to determine these coefficients ,",
    "we have matched our psf stars to the reference catalog obtaining more than 50 matches in every exposure / chip .",
    "we begin with an initial estimation of the zeropoint @xmath30 defined as the median of the difference between the instrumental and reference magnitude for all stars in our exposures that are matched to the reference catalog .",
    "zeropoints are worked out for each chip in each exposure , independently .",
    "the resulting values are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : zerop ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to examine the distribution of values of the difference between the instrumental and reference magnitudes for matched stars in one of the chips / exposures , on which this initial estimate of the zeropoint is based .",
    "these values are shown in figure  [ fig : seeingmagerr ] and are typical of all the chips / exposures .",
    "the range of values is very large , of the order of several magnitudes .",
    "while the median operation reduces the effect of outliers , the number of them is so large that it implies that there is an issue with the matched magnitudes .",
    "the origin of this issue is that we are comparing two catalogs with very different angular resolutions : our reference catalog is seeing - limited while our observations with gems are diffraction - limited .",
    "therefore , our reference stars include multiple stars that are resolved in our images but not in the reference catalog .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : seeingcalib ] , where the left image is from our reference dataset and the right image is the corresponding part of the image from our data .     image .",
    "the large spread does not correlate with the magnitude errors estimated by daophot.[fig : seeingmagerr],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is therefore necessary to reformulate our estimate of @xmath30 for each chip / exposure . for a star in our reference catalog ,",
    "its true magnitude @xmath32 is related to its reported magnitude @xmath33 via @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a correction that accounts for unresolved companions located within a distance equal to the spatial resolution of our reference catalog . normally , this would equal the seeing of the observation .",
    "however , given our reference catalog is based on a composite dataset , we determine its spatial resolution by making a histogram of the distances of every star to their closest neighbor in the catalog , shown in figure  [ fig : seeingrad ] .",

    "figure  [ fig : seeingmag ] plots @xmath35 against @xmath43 for all matched stars in a single chip / exposure .",
    "there is a clearly defined linear relationship between the reference magnitude and the instrumental magnitude corrected for the nearby neighbors that are unresolved in the reference catalog .",
    "accounting for this contribution naturally explains the large spread in the difference between instrumental and reference magnitudes that we observed in figure  [ fig : seeingmagerr ] .",
    "the appropriate value for the zeropoint is then the y - intercept of the best fit linear model with a slope equal to 1 , shown by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : seeingmag ] .",
    "we note that to determine the zeropoint to high accuracy as is done here requires us to eliminate all spurious detections in the vicinity of bright stars , especially those relating to the `` orphan '' halos discussed previously in section  [ sec : psfrad ] .     and the diffrence between the instrumental magnitudes @xmath42 in our data and the corresponding reference magnitudes @xmath33 in the seeing limited catalog ( see text for details ) .",
    "the best fit linear relationship with a slope of 1 is shown by the dashed line.[fig : seeingmag],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the k@xmath0 zeropoints calculated in this way are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : zerop ] and are highly correlated between chips .",
    "the improvement of this calibration can be quantified by comparing the left and middle panels in figure  [ fig : seeingcmd ] , where we have used the same metric of the width of the msto as used earlier .",
    "indeed , the improvement is also visible by eye in comparing the widths of the red giant branch . we do not find a significant spatial variation of the zeropoint in any of the images .",
    "we note that it is a common photometric calibration strategy to observe a standard star or stars near in time and space to the science observation",
    ". however , the variation in the zeropoint of each chip between subsequent exposures , that is visible in figure  [ fig : zerop ] , warns against this strategy for mcao observations .",
    "adopting a zeropoint for a given image based on observations in a different image , even one taken immediately before in the same direction , could be a source of error for precision mcao photometric observations .",
    "there are many ways to simulate this ; we demonstrate this here by averaging the zeropoints in one band of each quadrant of gsaoi , and adopting these as the appropriate zeropoint corrections for all exposures .",

    "we attempt to calculate only a single term @xmath31 for each chip and can therefore use all the exposures . to simplify our analysis , we consider only those matched stars that have little contamination from nearby stars ( @xmath44 ) , thus we can assume that the color reported in the reference catalog is close to the real one . for every of those stars ,",
    "we calculate @xmath45 as a function of the color @xmath46 .",

    "the pearson correlation coefficients of the k@xmath0 band are 0.34 , 0.27 , 0.23 , and 0.11 for the four chips , indicating that there is not a significant correlation with color .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed analysis of the photometric performance of gems / gsaoi using data obtained during its science verification phase . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on developing the optimal strategies for obtaining precise stellar photometry from mcao images using science based metrics to quantify the success or otherwise of our approaches for crowded fields .",
    "our strategy is based on the well known technique of psf fitting , specifically with the daophot ii suite of programs , but modified to account for the challenges posed by mcao data , especially the significant temporal and spatial variation in the psf .",
    "efficient exploitation of mcao imaging in the nir is absolutely essential to the future of ground - based astronomy given the development of the next generation of oir telescopes , especially tmt and the e - elt .",
    "the following is a list of our primary conclusions :    * mcao delivers a more uniform correction than classical ao over the moderately wide field of view .",
    "however , the shape of the psf can still vary significantly in a complex manner , both spatially and temporally ( i.e. , between exposures ; section  [ sec : performance ] ) , as also found by @xcite .",
    "it is possible that some of this variation has been removed since gems has undergone several realignments of the optics , but residual variability is still expected . as a consequence ,",
    "this should be reflected in the creation of the psf model by allowing it to have a high degree of spatial variability , and by treating all exposures independantly . *",
    "the mcao correction is applied on a scale equal to the `` control radius '' of the system .",
    "the majority of the spatial variability of the psf is found within this radius .",
    "we demonstrate that we obtain the most precise photometry when the radius of the psf model is set approximately equal to the control radius of the ao system ( section  [ sec : psfrad ] ) .",
    "if the psf radius is considerably smaller than the control radius , part of the variable psf controlled by the mcao system is not measured , causing a systematic error dependent on the position of the stars .",
    "if the psf radius is much larger than the control radius , then the resulting model attempts to include the halo of the psf .",
    "this region is generally not varying and contains a fixed fraction of the flux in the psf , and can therefore be accounted for during the calibration procedure .",
    "if the psf model includes these outer regions , then the low flux levels mean that other features , including noise artifacts and faint stars , are included and identified as intrinsic features of the psf .",
    "this results in an incorrect psf model for these regions and a reduction in the precision of the photometry .",
    "* there is an appreciable improvement in photometric precision when the psf model is based on a second iteration of the derivation procedure , i.e. , derived from an image which has had non - psf stars subtracted ( section  [ sec : psfclean ] ) .",
    "this practice is likely less important with sparse fields .",
    "* during the profile fitting , the sky flux under every star is measured interior to the psf radius . in exposures with a large fwhm , we have noticed that using an area significantly smaller than the psf radius increases the precision of the photometry ( section  [ sec : psfsky ] ) .",
    "we postulate that this is because a larger sky region is more likely to have contamination from unidentified stars , leading to inaccuracies in the sky measurements . *",
    "simultaneous profile fitting of all the observations , such as is done with allframe , should be avoided because of the difficulty in finding the proper geometric transformation for the edges of some of the images . treating the images",
    "independently leads to more robust photometric / astrometric solutions ( section  [ sec : psfindep ] ) . *",
    "calibration of mcao photometry is complex .",
    "standard star observations are insufficient to estimate the zeropoint since the zeropoint changes for each exposure as a result of the mcao correction .",
    "it is therefore advisable to match every exposure and chip independently to a reference catalog of the same field , that is itself calibrated to the nir 2mass system .",
    "the measurement of the zeropoints must account for the different spatial resolutions of the catalogs ( section  [ sec : calibration ] ) . for gems",

    "when combined with optical hst acs data , the ( v - j ) and ( v - k@xmath0 ) cmds allow for the identification of the split subgiant branch ( already demonstrated for the k@xmath0 band in @xcite . with precision photometry and high quality psf modeling in hand , a future contribution will discuss the astrometric performance and precision of our data using a similar approach of the identification of science - based metrics .",

    "<S> we present a detailed discussion of how to obtain precise stellar photometry in crowded fields using images obtained with multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) , with the intent of informing the scientific development of this key technology for the extremely large telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> we use deep j and k@xmath0 exposures of ngc 1851 obtained using the gemini multi - conjugate adaptive optics system ( gems ) on gemini south to quantify the performance of the system and to develop an optimal strategy for extracting precise stellar photometry from the images using well - known psf - fitting techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we judge the success of the various techniques we employ by using science - based metrics , particularly the width of the main sequence turn - off region . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the gems photometry with the exquisite hst data of the same target in the visible . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the psf produced by gems possesses significant spatial and temporal variability that must be accounted for during the photometric analysis by allowing the psf model a reasonably high degree of spatial variability and by treating all exposures independently . as with seeing - limited observations , </S>",
    "<S> steps need to be taken to minimize contamination of the psf model and sky estimates from unidentified faint neighboring stars . </S>",
    "<S> we show that standard star observations are insufficient to provide accurate photometric calibration of mcao data . instead </S>",
    "<S> , we cross - match sources in our mcao observations to a calibrated seeing - limited catalog with a shallower depth but sufficient to include a large number of common sources . </S>",
    "<S> however , done in this way , it is critical to consider the different spatial resolutions of the two datasets by accounting for stars that are multiple sources in the mcao dataset but which appear as single sources in the seeing - limited catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we identify photometric calibration as a critical issue for next generation mcao systems such as those on tmt and the e - elt . </S>",
    "<S> our final cmds reach k@xmath123 , below the main sequence knee of this cluster , and theoretical isochrones provide remarkable agreement with the stellar locus in our data from the main sequence knee to the red giant branch . </S>"
