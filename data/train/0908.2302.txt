    "the inflationary paradigm for explaining the early universe is in vogue for quite a few years now . the original motivation for invoking the idea of inflation @xcite was to resolve the problems associated with standard big bang cosmology .",
    "coupled with that is precise observational data from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite observations and other independent measures @xcite which have started coming of late , thereby enforcing the models of inflation to face the challenge of passing through the crucial tests of observations . in the simplest models",
    ", inflation is driven by _",
    "inflaton _ , a single scalar field , which evolves slowly along a nearly flat potential which is difficult to achieve in the context of particle physics motivated models @xcite .",
    "further , the initial vacuum quantum fluctuation of the inflaton is translated into macroscopic cosmological perturbations in the early universe which have imprints on the cmb radiation .",
    "thus , any model of inflation should , in principle , not only give a super - accelerated phase at early time leading to the correct number of e - foldings but also produce the correct power spectra the imprints of which are directly observable from cmb observations .",
    "as more and more precise cosmological data is available it is fascinating to learn from the observations , some crucial clues about the fundamental physics of the early universe .",
    "attempts in this direction from diverse angles include standard particle physics motivated models @xcite and allied phenomenological models @xcite , string theory inspired models @xcite , inflation from supersymmetry @xcite , warm inflation @xcite , multi - field inflation @xcite and braneworld models @xcite among others .",
    "although most of those models of inflation have some positive feature or the other , the nature of field(s ) responsible for inflation is still an open question .    recently",
    "a proposal to satisfy the flatness conditions by considering the inflation occurring near a local maximum of the potential came out , which is termed as  hilltop \" inflation @xcite . in this paradigm ,",
    "the cosmological scale leaves the horizon the time the inflaton is on the top of the hill .",
    "nowadays hilltop inflation has turned out to be a very prospective model to explain early universe phenomena in the sense that in these models a flat potential can easily be converted to one with a maximum with the addition of one or two terms from a power law series .",
    "nevertheless , many models can be converted to hilltop by suitable tuning of parameters .    in this article",
    ", we would like to present a variant of the hilltop inflation , the crucial characteristic feature of which is that here the modification to the flat potential is not mere addition of one or two terms from a power series , rather a hyperbolic function which contains infinite number of terms in the power series expansion , thereby making the theory a more concrete and accurate at the same time .",
    "we further notice that our choice of the potential bears close similarity with its counterpart in mutated hybrid inflation , so far as its variation with the scalar field is concerned . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we name our proposal `` mutated hilltop inflation '' . nevertheless , throughout the article we succeed in having analytical expressions for the parameters and observables and confront them with observational data .",
    "our model is found to be in excellent agreement with observational data .",
    "we are thus led to believe that mutated hilltop inflation is more or less a natural choice to explain the early universe as well as observations related to perturbations therefrom .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii we propose a model for mutated hilltop inflation and show that for some valid approximation one can indeed have analytical expressions for the scalar field , scale factor and number of e - foldings .",
    "we then prove the validity of the model both analytically and numerically . to this end",
    ", we estimate the observable quantities using the slow roll parameters and fit them with observational data .",
    "section iii deals with the analysis of the typical energy scale of inflation from our model and shows that the energy scale is consistent with observational bound . in section",
    "iv we study quantum fluctuations based on our model and derive the analytical expressions for the observable quantities related to perturbations , like the power spectra , spectral index and its running , and the ratio of the tensor to scalar amplitudes .",
    "we further subject the results to observational verification by estimating those quantities for our model , and show that our model is in good agreement with observational data as well .",
    "we thus succeed in having both analytical expressions and observational consistency of our model .",
    "finally , we end up with some open issues related to our work .",
    "the potential we would like to propose has the form @xmath0 \\label{pot}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 represents the typical energy scale for hilltop inflation and @xmath2 is a parameter which has dimension of inverse planck mass .",
    "we will see later on that , in our model , @xmath1 has typical value of @xmath3 , which is the characteristic feature of models based on supergravity theory , consistent with the observational bound as well .    in choosing the above form of the potential",
    "we are somewhat motivated by the models of inflation in the framework of supergravity , either in the context of d - branes @xcite or in the paradigm of tachyonic inflation models @xcite , or simply in supergravity - inspired models @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the earlier models of hilltop inflation is that the inflation occurs near the maximum of the potential .",
    "the potential ( [ pot ] ) as proposed by us is a generic one having infinite number of terms in power series expansion which takes into account the two - term approximation incorporated in many of the models of hilltop inflation , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that any potential in supergravity paradigm should have , in principle , infinite number of terms , which is taken care of in the model proposed by us , thereby making the theory more physically relevant and accurate at the same time .",
    "moreover , our model satisfies the condition of vanishing of the potential and its slope at its absolute minimum @xcite i.e. @xmath4 , which characterizes a significant difference from the the usual hilltop potential .",
    "several models with flat scalar potential are around , which are based on susy and nonlinearly realized symmetry or shift symmetry .",
    "but the susy alone can not naturally provide potentials that are flat enough for inflation , once supergravity effects are included .",
    "the realization of a valid mechanism is through pseudo nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) @xcite .",
    "however , the simplest scenario with a single pngb does not work unless the symmetry breaking scale is higher than the planck scale , which is presumably outside the range of validity of an effective field theoretic description . here",
    "the possible realization of inflaton scale to be higher than the planck scale is substantiated via a prescription which considers the inflaton as the extra components of gauge fields propagating in extra dimensions @xcite . as it will turn out in due course , our model results in an inflaton scale higher than the planck scale , resonating with the above discussions .",
    "one may also argue that the effective inflaton potential in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite have some similarity ( apart from the so - called a - term that characterizes mssm inflation ) with the power law expansion of the potential proposed here . keeping all these points in our mind",
    ", we are motivated to choose a novel potential of the said form which have most of the plus points inbuilt .",
    "nevertheless , what will turn out is that the form of the potential does have very significant consequences so far as observational aspects related to perturbations are concerned .",
    "we will discuss this issue in due course . though we do not show a priori how this potential can be realized from an effective field theory , we presume it may be an outcome of extra components of gauge fields propagating in extra dimensions as proposed in @xcite . however , we are yet to make any strong comment on the origin as such .",
    "any progress in this direction will be reported in future .     variation of the potential (  in units of  @xmath5 ) with the scalar field .",
    "the plots correspond to three sets of values for @xmath6 from bottom to top.,width=264,height=188 ]    figure [ figvphi ] shows the explicit behavior of the potential with the inflaton field for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "it will be revealed later on that @xmath7 gives the best fit model from observational ground .",
    "so , here , and throughout the rest of the paper , we adhere to this range for @xmath2 .",
    "the nature of the potential in figure [ figvphi ] is a characteristic feature of mutated hilltop inflation models , which resemble mutated hybrid inflation models .",
    "our model thus falls in the wider class of hilltop inflation , which revisits the salient features of inflation from a different perspective .",
    "the initial position of the inflaton field is very important in any model as an initial condition for successful inflation @xcite .",
    "the considerations of the naturalness also depend crucially on the underlying assumptions of the model . in the known hilltop potential @xcite , the inflaton scale is typically 3 orders of magnitude below planck scale , which incorporates eternal inflation thereby bypassing the problem of initial conditions .",
    "but , as it appears , this leads to a new problem related to entropy of the universe . in a bit more details ,",
    "if the universe is closed , its total entropy must be greater than @xmath8 with its total mass at the beginning of the inflation being greater than @xmath9 . at present",
    "the entropy of the universe is greater than @xmath10 .",
    "the explanation of this observation requires the assumption that the entropy was extremely large from the very beginning , but that leads to the difficulty of understanding the homogeneity of the large universe .",
    "therefore , though the problem of initial condition can be bypassed , it leads to a new problem which is too important to avoid .",
    "an way of alleviating the initial condition problem for the low scale inflation is via the consideration of a compact flat or open universe with nontrivial topology @xcite i.e. , the compact topologically nontrivial flat or open universes are probable than the standard friedmann universes for the inflation occurring much below the planck density .",
    "but then one has to explain how it evolved to the friedmann universe which has to be there after the universe becomes observable .",
    "so , if the universe has to boil down to the observable universe , it is good to rely on friedmann universe with super - planckian inflaton scale . on the other hand , the models based on chaotic initial conditions ,",
    "the process of natural inflation occurs at @xmath11 @xcite . from the generic expression for the effective potential @xmath12",
    "it may be noted that with the generic assumption @xmath13 , the effective theory is not under control over the behavior of @xmath14 at @xmath15 @xcite . a possible way to overcome",
    "the problem of the generic assumption @xmath13 is to consider inflation occurring below planck scale , which creates a new problem , as revealed earlier .",
    "furthermore , the sub - planckian inflaton scale also leads to the so called @xmath16-problem in the string inflation scenarios .",
    "in other words , the second slow - roll parameter @xmath17 in string theory while inflation requires @xmath18 . however , there are some recent proposals of addressing this problem @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath15 attributes to the non - renormalizable quantum gravity with a cut - off at momenta @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the quantum gravity effects are considerable only at super - planckian inflaton mass scales .",
    "as already discussed in somewhat details , the situation can be dealt with @xcite if @xmath20 is considered as a pngb and a scale of spontaneous breaking @xmath21 @xcite . in due course , it will be revealed that our proposal of mutated hilltop inflation deals with the inflaton scale @xmath11 .",
    "this is in accordance with the major conclusion of the above discussions on initial condition leading to super - planckian inflaton scale .",
    "the friedmann equation for the homogeneous and isotropic flat universe , dominated by this type of inflationary potential for the scalar field , is given by @xmath22\\ ] ] at this point , one can straightaway use the slow roll parameters to analyze the outcome of the above equation . instead",
    ", we will use the hubble slow roll parameters which are defined as @xmath23 our basic intention of using hubble slow roll parameters is not to restrict ourselves in the usual slow roll approximation which are somewhat limited in a generic supergravity theory @xcite but to use a more accurate version of the same given by the above hubble slow roll parameters .",
    "consequently , with the above friedmann equation for the typical inflaton potential ( [ pot ] ) the hubble slow roll parameters take the form @xmath24 ^ 2 } \\label{epsh } \\\\ \\eta_h & = & m_p^2 \\frac{\\alpha^2 { \\rm sech}(\\alpha\\phi)[{\\rm sech}^2(\\alpha\\phi)-\\tanh^2(\\alpha\\phi)]}{[1-{\\rm sech } ( \\alpha\\phi)]}- \\frac{m_p^2}{2}\\frac{\\alpha^2 { \\rm sech}^2(\\alpha\\phi)\\tanh^2(\\alpha\\phi)}{[1-{\\rm sech}(\\alpha\\phi)]^2 }   \\label{etah}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation supplementary to ( [ fdq ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the klein - gordon equation for the homogeneous scalar field in the cosmological background is given by @xmath25 where an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "imposing the slow - roll approximation @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and using our potential ( [ pot ] ) the evolution equation ( [ kg ] ) for the scalar field boils down to @xmath28    an exact solution for the above equation can indeed be obtained by direct integration . written explicitly , the solution looks @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\sqrt{\\cosh(\\alpha\\phi ) } \\sinh(\\frac{\\alpha\\phi}{2}))]=-\\alpha\\sqrt{\\frac{v_0}{3}}m_p t+ { \\rm constant }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , though exact , this solution is not very useful for practical purpose because of its complicacy .",
    "precisely , in order to deal with estimates of observable quantities , one has to use this expression for further analytical and numerical calculations , which is not easy to handle .",
    "a route bypassing the problem is to do numerical estimation for the parameters without bothering much about the analytical expressions as such .",
    "instead , one can search for an approximate analytic solution for eq ( [ kgpot ] ) which will help us derive analytical expressions for most of the parameters involved with the theory of inflation and perturbations therefrom .",
    "this will , in turn , help us visualize the pros and cons of the scenario both analytically and numerically for quantitative estimation at a later stage .",
    "we foresee more merit in this second route and will follow this subsequently .    in order to obtain the analytical expressions for the parameters we incorporate the following steps . keeping the terms",
    "upto the second power of @xmath30 in eq ( [ kgpot ] ) , the analytic solution for the equation is found to be @xmath31 where the constant can be found from the condition that at the end of inflation @xmath32 , the scalar field has the value @xmath33 .",
    "this readily gives @xmath34 with @xmath35 which can be estimated once @xmath36 is known from observational bound for the hubble slow roll parameters at the end of inflation .",
    "variation of the inflaton field with time  ( in units of @xmath37 ) for the same set of values for @xmath2,width=264,height=188 ]    in figure [ figphit ] we show the variation of the scalar field with time for the best fit value of @xmath38 .",
    "the plots clearly show that the scalar field gradually decays as it approaches towards the end of inflation , finally reaching a value @xmath36 as determined above .    with the expression ( [ cond ] ) for the scalar field as a solution for the klein - gordon equation in the slow - roll regime , we arrive at the following equation @xmath39 consequently",
    ", the solution for the scale factor turns out to be @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41\\ ] ] is the scale factor at the end of inflation , scaled by the exponential term .",
    "variation of the hubble parameter  ( in units of  @xmath42 ) with time  ( in units of @xmath43 ) for the best fit model , width=264,height=188 ]    in figure [ fight ] we show the variation of the hubble parameter with time as calculated from the above expression for the scale factor .",
    "the plot represents the typical characteristic of the hubble parameter during inflationary phase .",
    "further , from observational ground it is also interesting to find out the expressions for the number of e - foldings which is defined as @xmath44 for our model , the expression for the number of e - foldings turns out to be @xmath45_{\\phi_{end}}^{\\phi_{in } }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    plot of the number of e - foldings versus scalar field for three sets of values for @xmath2,width=264,height=188 ]    figure [ fignphi ] shows the plot of e - foldings versus scalar field for the best fit values of @xmath2 .",
    "the figure is in agreement with the observational requirement for e - foldings @xmath46 .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we have estimated the values of different observables form our model using slow roll parameters for three different sets for the values of @xmath47 which are found to give best fit results .",
    ".table for different parameters related to the present model of inflation as calculated from the slow roll parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the table shows remarkable coincidence with the results obtained in table 1 using slow roll parameters . at the same time",
    ", it gives a more accurate result and succeeds to a great extent so far as observational features of the model is concerned . from the table",
    "it is quite clear that the observable parameters related to perturbations , _ viz _ , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as calculated from our model , are in excellent agreement with observational bound .",
    "the spectrum @xmath51 of tensor perturbation conveniently specified by the tensor fraction @xmath52 yields the relation @xmath53 in the slow - roll approximation @xcite .",
    "however , one should note that the usual relation may not strictly hold for our model .",
    "the interpretation for this conclusion is as follows .",
    "the usual practice in calculating the relation between the observable quantities @xmath50 and @xmath54 is to use the de sitter result @xmath55 .",
    "however , this is strictly valid for a de sitter universe only . as a matter of fact ,",
    "most of the models fail to obtain analytical expressions , and , hence , subject the result @xmath56 directly to observational verification . in this article",
    "we followed the same prescription in calculating the quantities and confronting them with observations .",
    "of course , observationally one can not go too far from de sitter , but the analytical results , from a model other than de sitter , may lead to a relation not exactly identical to , but pretty close to @xmath56 , at least observationally . strictly speaking , in order to get a relation between these two observable quantities one has to reformulate the perturbation theory from exact expression of scale factor as obtained from the model , without using the de sitter result @xmath55 a priori .",
    "thus , a rigorous calculation alleviating the de sitter relation may lead to a modified version of the relation @xmath56 .",
    "fortunately , we do have analytical expressions in our model .",
    "we have now engaged ourselves in obtaining this modified relation analytically .",
    "some work in this direction is in progress @xcite and we have found some interesting results .",
    "we hope to report this in near future .",
    "in this article we have proposed a variant of hilltop inflation models , called mutated hilltop inflation , driven by a hyperbolic potential for the scalar field that has intriguing feature of producing analytical expressions for most of the quantities . to this end , we have derived the expressions for the scalar field , the scale factor , the number of e - foldings and the typical energy scale for inflation from our model .",
    "the results have then be subject to observational tests by finding out the values of observable quantities from slow roll parameters .",
    "next , we have engaged ourselves in formulating the theory of quantum fluctuation in our specific model and have used the results to find out the power spectra for both scalar and tensor fluctuations .",
    "these expressions for power spectra have then been used to find out the most crucial observable parameters _ i.e. _ , spectral index , the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes and the running of spectral index .",
    "all these parameters have been evaluated during horizon crossing .",
    "the results match with their counterparts as calculated from slow roll parameters very well and show excellent agreement with cmb data and other independent observations .",
    "we thus infer that mutated hilltop inflation is more or less a natural choice for the explanation of early universe phenomena",
    ".    certain features still remain as open issues in this model the most crucial of them being a more rigorous development of the perturbation theory in this framework .",
    "the quantum fluctuations have been studied using near - de sitter approximation . alleviating this approximation",
    "would definitely alter the analytical expressions , though , predictably , the numerical results will not change significantly .",
    "however , a reformulation of the theory of fluctuations with the exact expression for scale factor is useful to have important physical insight and check with more and more accurate data available .",
    "this is a rather formidable task because of the complications arising in having analytical expressions .",
    "the work in this direction will be reported shortly @xcite .",
