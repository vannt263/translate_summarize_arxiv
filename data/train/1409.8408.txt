    "interesting magnetic behavior in heisenberg spin systems originates from a network of some elementary motifs such as triangles or tetrahedra , where the spins placed at their vertices interact with each other via antiferromagnetic interactions . due to the incompatibility of the nearest neighbor interactions of a spin with respect to achieving the lowest energy",

    "the appearance of a broad maximum has also been noticed in the plot of @xmath131 vs @xmath21 for many spin liquid systems.@xcite this suggests that the broad maximum in our @xmath58 might be a characteristic feature of highly frustrated spin systems .",
    "generally , the position of this broad maximum in @xmath1 data for frustrated spin systems varies according to the strength of exchange couplings , spin value and dimensionality of the system , and is found to roughly appear at @xmath132 @xmath133 to @xmath134 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the titled compound",
    ", we found the broad maximum at @xmath135 , which is close to the value of 0.04 found in na@xmath12ir@xmath13o@xmath14 .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath136 ( @xmath137 j / mol k ) for pbcute@xmath2o@xmath3 is also similar to that of na@xmath12ir@xmath13o@xmath14 indicating that the pbcute@xmath2o@xmath3 may have similar magnetic correlations .",

    "the absence of lro down to @xmath117 mk with a relatively large @xmath39 of @xmath6 k and the appearance of a broad maximum at @xmath144 k in @xmath1 data all together provide a hunch of possible quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) ground state .",
