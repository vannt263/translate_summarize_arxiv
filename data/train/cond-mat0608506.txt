    "the transport of a polymer through a nanopore is associated with an energy barrier arising from loss of configurational entropy due to the geometric constriction .",
    "such processes are commonly observed in biology , such as dna and rna translocation across nuclear pores , protein transport through membrane channels , and virus injection  @xcite .",
    "moreover , translocation processes have various potential technological applications , such as rapid dna sequencing  @xcite , gene therapy and controlled drug delivery , _ etc _  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the translocation dynamics is also a challenging topic in polymer physics .",
    "particularly , the scaling of translocation time @xmath10 with the chain length @xmath1 is an important measure of the underlying dynamics of polymer translocation . as a result ,",
    "recently a considerable number of experimental  @xcite , theoretical  @xcite and numerical studies  @xcite have been carried out .    in order to overcome a large entropic barrier in polymer translocation and to speed up the translocation , an external driving force is needed in experiments , such as an electric field , chemical potential difference , or selective adsorption on one side of the membrane .",
    "for example , in 1996 , kasianowicz _",
    "et al_.  @xcite reported an elegant experiment where an electric field can drive single - stranded dna and rna molecules through the @xmath11-hemolysin channel of inside diameter 2 nm and that the passage of each molecule is signaled by the blockade in the channel current .",
    "in fact , the translocation process includes two essential steps .",
    "first , one end of the polymer enters the pore directed by diffusion and by the action of an electric field near the pore .",
    "the experimental results show that the ability of the polymer to enter the nanopore depends linearly on polymer concentration and exponentially on the applied voltage  @xcite .",
    "second , the polymer is translocated from one side of the membrane to the other , driven by the electric field . in the experiment for @xmath12-hemolysin , the linear behavior of @xmath10 with the @xmath1",
    "is observed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an inverse linear dependence and an inverse quadratic dependence of the translocation time on applied voltage are observed for different experiments  @xcite .",
    "to overcome the limited voltage range that can be applied across a biological pore and the difficulty in analyzing the current variations because the shot noise is comparable to the expected signal , recently li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a solid - state nanopore could also be used for similar experiments .",
    "most recently , storm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out a set of experiments on double - stranded dna molecules with various lengths that translocate through a solid - state nanopore  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , a power - law scaling of the most probable translocation time with the polymer length , with an exponent 1.27 was observed , in contrast to the linear behavior observed for all experiments on @xmath11-hemolysin channel .    inspired by the experiments  @xcite ,",
    "a number of recent theories  @xcite have been developed for the dynamics of polymer translocation .",
    "even for the field free case , polymer translocation remains a challenging problem . to this end , sung and park  @xcite and muthukumar  @xcite considered equilibrium entropy of the polymer as a function of the position of the polymer through the nanopore .",
    "standard kramer analysis of diffusion through this entropic barrier yields a scaling prediction of the translocation time @xmath13 for long chains .",
    "however , as chuang _ et al_.  @xcite noted , this quadratic scaling behavior can not be correct for a self - avoiding polymer .",
    "the reason is that the translocation time is shorter than the equilibration time of a self - avoiding polymer , @xmath14 , where @xmath3 is the flory exponent  @xcite , thus rendering the concept of equilibrium entropy and the ensuing entropic barrier inappropriate for the study of translocation dynamics .",
    "et al_.  @xcite performed numerical simulations with rouse dynamics for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice model to study the translocation for both phantom and self - avoiding polymers .",
    "they decoupled the translocation dynamics from the diffusion dynamics outside the pore by imposing the artificial restriction that the first monomer , which is initially placed in the pore , is never allowed to cross back out of the pore .",
    "their results show that for large @xmath1 , translocation time scales approximately in the same manner as equilibration time .    for forced translocation , sung and park",
    "@xcite and muthukumar  @xcite suggested a linear dependence @xmath15 under a strong field .",
    "this is in agreement with some experimental results  @xcite for polymer translocation through @xmath11-hemolysin channel .",
    "in addition , dynamic monte carlo ( mc ) simulation using gaussian chain model  @xcite and langevin dynamics simulation using rather short chains  @xcite seem to support the linear behavior .",
    "however , the above theories can not explain the recent experimental result , namely that @xmath16 for polymer translocation through the solid - state nanopore  @xcite .",
    "recently , kantor and kardar  @xcite demonstrated that the assumption of equilibrium in brownian polymer dynamics by sung and park  @xcite and muthukumar  @xcite breaks down more easily in the presence of a driving field and provided a lower bound @xmath17 for the translocation time by comparison to the unimpeded motion of the polymer .",
    "however , in their simulations they failed to observe this scaling behavior , which was attributed to the finite size effect of the polymer length .",
    "@xcite in addition , they also checked a polymer that is being pulled by one end .",
    "a quadratic dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath1 is predicted in their theory and confirmed by their simulations  @xcite .",
    "most recently , we have investigated both free  @xcite and forced  @xcite translocation using the two - dimensional fluctuating bond ( fb ) model with single - segment monte carlo moves . for the free translocation , to overcome the entropic barrier without artificial restrictions we considered a polymer , which is initially placed in the middle of the pore , and examined the escape time @xmath18 required for the polymer to completely exit the pore on either end .",
    "we found numerically that @xmath18 scales with the chain length @xmath1 as @xmath19 .",
    "this is the same scaling as predicted for the translocation time of a polymer which passes through the nanopore in one direction only  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also investigated the interplay between the pore length @xmath20 and the radius of gyration @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath22 , we numerically verified that asymptotically @xmath19 , while for @xmath23 , we found @xmath24 . for forced translocation",
    ", we investigated the translocation dynamics under an external field within the pore . as our main result",
    ", we found a crossover scaling for the translocation time @xmath10 with the chain length from @xmath25 for relatively short polymers to @xmath9 for longer chains .",
    "our results disagree with the experimental data that @xmath10 depends linearly on @xmath1 in the case of @xmath11-hemolysin  @xcite , but the predicted short chain exponent @xmath26 in three dimensions agrees reasonably well with the solid - state nanopore experiments of storm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the experimental setup is closer to the theoretical models investigated .",
    "no crossover in scaling behavior was observed in this experiment , presumably due to the fact that the polymers used in experiments are not long enough .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the translocation dynamics using langevin dynamics simulations ( ld ) .",
    "previous ld simulations using rather short chains  @xcite seem to support the linear behavior for forced translocation time as a function of @xmath1 , which is not expected to be correct for self - avoiding polymer .",
    "also this result is in contradiction with the fb model simulations .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the fb model is based on single - segment monte carlo moves and thus neglects all translational degrees of freedom of the chain .",
    "thus it is important to check that this does not adversely affect translocation dynamics . in section [ chap - model ] , we briefly describe our model and the simulation technique . in section [ chap - results ] ,",
    "we present our results for both free and driven translocation . for the free case ,",
    "the emphasis is on verifying the scaling exponent obtained previously with the fb - model @xcite . for translocation under an electric field , we concentrate on studying the crossover in the scaling of translocation time as a function of the polymer length and on the influence of friction in the scaling exponent",
    ". finally , the conclusions and discussion are in section [ chap - conclusions ] .",
    "in the simulations , the polymer chains are modeled as bead - spring chains of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles with the finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential . both excluded volume and van der waals interactions between beads",

    "time scale is given by @xmath46 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the langevin equation is integrated in time by a method described by ermak and buckholtz @xcite in 2d . for the pore , we set @xmath50 and @xmath51 unless otherwise stated . to create the initial configuration , the first monomer of the chain is placed in the entrance of the pore .",
    "the polymer is then let to relax to obtain an equilibrium configuration such that the first monomer position is fixed at the entrance but the other monomers are under thermal collisions described by the langevin thermostat . in all of our simulations we did a number of runs with uncorrelated initial states and random numbers describing the random collisions .",
    "the estimate for the translocation time was obtained by neglecting any failed translocation and then calculating the average duration of the accepted translocations .",
    "we note here that in some articles e.g. in ref .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] ( a ) ( b )    the dynamics of a single - segment passing through the pore during translocation is an important issue , as far as experiments are concerned .",
    "the non - equilibrium nature of translocation has a considerable effect on this .",
    "we have numerically calculated the waiting times for each monomer passing through the pore .",
    "we define the waiting time of monomer @xmath105 as the average time between the events that monomer @xmath105 and monomer @xmath106 exit the pore .",
    "the waiting times for chains of length @xmath68 and @xmath54 are presented in fig .",
    "[ waitingn100 ] .",
    "the waiting time depends strongly on the monomer position in the chain . for the shorter polymer @xmath68",
    "the monomers approximately in the middle of the polymer need the longest time to translocate and the distribution is close to symmetric .",
    "however , for the polymer of length @xmath54 , it s approximately the 220@xmath107 monomer that needs the longest time to thread the pore , which indicates that during late stages of translocation the high density of segments of a long polymer near the pore slows down the translocation .",
    "the same phenomenon was found in our earlier study with the fb - model @xcite .",
    "in this work , we investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation through a nanopore using the two - dimensional ( 2d ) langevin dynamics simulations . for free translocation , we consider a polymer which is initially placed in the middle of the pore and study the escape time @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of the escape times is wide and has a long tail .",
    "we verified that average escape time ( as well as the most probable escape time ) scales with the chain length @xmath1 as @xmath108 .",
    "these results confirm previous theoretical studies based on a less miscrosopic fluctuating bond model . for forced translocation",
    ", we concentrate on studying the influence of the friction @xmath4 , driving force @xmath5 and polymer chain length @xmath1 . for strong driving forces ,",
    "the distribution of translocation times is narrow without a long tail and symmetric , which is completely different compared with free translocation .",
    "the influence of the @xmath4 on the translocation time depends on the ratio between driving force and frictional force .",
    "we find translocation time @xmath6 is inverse proportional to driving force for a wide range of friction values .",
    "finally , as regards to the dependence of translocation on the length of the polymer , we find a crossover scaling for the @xmath6 with @xmath1 from @xmath8 for relatively short polymers to @xmath9 for longer chains at moderate values of the friction . for higher @xmath4 , there is no crossover because in this case the rouse relaxation time is extremely long compared with translocation time .",
    "these scaling behaviors can be understood from the observation that in the limit of large @xmath1 and @xmath4 , there is a high density of segments near the exit of the pore , which slows down the translocation process due to slow relaxation of the chain .",
