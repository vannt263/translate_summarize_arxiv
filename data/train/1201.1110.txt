    "the upper bound of @xmath89 in the first part of theorem [ theo : main ] is related to courant nodal theorem ( see @xcite section vi.6 ) as follows : a nodal domain on a graph for the eigenfunction @xmath74 is a connected component of the sub - graph @xmath90 of @xmath9 obtained by removing the edges along which @xmath74 changes sign .",

    ". we will show that this restriction reduces the index precisely by @xmath97 .",
    "indeed , the splitting @xmath109 is orthogonal with respect to the form @xmath17 , therefore @xmath110 we establish that @xmath111 by relating the form @xmath17 on @xmath112 to the quadratic form @xmath96 around the point @xmath74 .",
