    "<S> although the fully self - consistent treatment of the residual ( induced ) interactions for the realistic energy functionals is becoming more and more prevalent @xcite , the rpa calculations for deformed nuclei are still computationally demanding . at present , the quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) for deformed superfluid nuclei are limited only to axially deformed cases @xcite , except for ref . </S>",

    "<S> it is well known , however , that almost all but magic nuclei display superfluid features . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a further improvement is highly desirable to make these methods applicable to the qrpa equations including correlations in the particle - particle and hole - hole channels . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is to generalize the fam to superfluid systems , which enables us to perform a qrpa calculation utilizing a static hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) code with minor modifications . </S>",
    "<S> our final goal would be the construction of a fast computer program for the fully self - consistent and triaxially deformed qrpa . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is a first step toward the goal , to present the basic equations of the fam for the qrpa and show the first result for spherical nuclei . </S>",
