    "quantum mechanics admits correlations of a very specific type ( entanglement ) but the task to create such correlations between several systems need not have a solution under given conditions .",
    "a natural way how to correlate two systems is to use mutual ( direct ) interaction between the two systems .",
    "such approach is unusable where the interaction is weak , the two systems are too far from each other , or simply they do not interact at all .",
    "however , even in the extreme case of non - interacting parties there is a possibility to correlate them .",
    "here we basically have two options : first , to perform a joint measurement on the two systems , and second , to use another ( ancillary ) system . as the first option requires another system , the measurement apparatus , as well , we focus on the second approach where an additional system is used .",
    "if we look at the problem from the operational point of view we can solve the problem in the following way .",
    "let us suppose that we want to create an epr pair shared by two parties denoted as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the additional party used to achieve the goal as @xmath2 .",
    "first @xmath2 creates an epr pair with party @xmath0 and a second epr pair with party @xmath1 .",
    "it means that the system @xmath2 is composed of two qubits . then by performing two - qubit ( bell ) measurement on the two qubits at site @xmath2 we actually create an epr pair shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1 irrespectively of the outcome of the bell measurement .",
    "the protocol outlined is the `` entanglement swapping '' protocol proposed by m.  zukowski et .",
    "@xcite and generalized by s.  bose et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the first experimental realization of the protocol was done by j.  w.  pan et.al . @xcite .        in the entanglement swapping protocol instead of creating entanglement shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "directly we create two maximally entangled pairs one shared by @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the second shared by @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "these entangled pairs can be produced using interaction or joint measurement as we have discussed at the beginning .",
    "so the entanglement is created in the same way as before and only additional tools are used to transfer this entanglement into correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in order not to use the same approach and explore different ways of creating the entanglement",
    "we modify the setup as follows .",
    "the two systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 interact with the system @xmath2 and the interaction is described by the hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these hamiltonians also include the local terms @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "let us remind that the systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not interact mutually and so the hamiltonian @xmath7 is zero .",
    "in addition , to control the entanglement produced between @xmath0 and @xmath1 we use the control of the system @xmath2 as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ obr2 ] .",
    "in such scenario we can not assume that it is possible to create epr pairs between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the result strongly depends on the choice of the hamiltonians and if for example the mutual interaction is absent ( the local parts can be present though ) no entanglement can be produced . in this spirit",
    "it is an interesting question under which conditions it is possible to create quantum correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it has recently been shown that for a large class of hamiltonians if we monitor ( measure ) the system @xmath2 continuously @xcite or even non - continuously but repeatedly @xcite it is indeed possible .",
    "this result can be understood as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 be the time of the free evolution of the system from the preparation to the measurement .",
    "if we prepare the three - partite system in a particular fully - factorized state , then after time @xmath8 the state of the system @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 are vectors of unit length , @xmath11 are complex coefficients and the basis @xmath12 corresponds to the measurement that we perform at time @xmath8 .",
    "this basis ( or measurement ) is chosen so that after performing the measurement and projecting the system onto one of the states @xmath13 the corresponding state @xmath14 of the subsystem @xmath15 is entangled . though the real protocol is more sophisticated , due to the probabilistic nature of the measurement process , and we need to monitor ( measure ) the system @xmath2 many times it explains the main idea and the role of the measurement of the system @xmath2 .",
    "it is the measurement that projects out the subsystem @xmath15 onto an entangled state and the efficiency of detectors , incompleteness of the measurement itself or complexity of the system @xmath2 can make the monitoring of the system @xmath2 difficult . as a consequence the entanglement is produced with a low degree or probability .",
    "it is an open question whether it is possible to create entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 without monitoring the system @xmath2 . in such case",
    "the setup is the same as before ( see fig .",
    "[ obr2 ] ) but the only control that we have is a local `` coherent '' control of the system @xmath2 .",
    "it means that we are allowed to change the parameters of the hamiltonian local at site @xmath2 but we are not allowed to perform measurements .",
    "so what we can do is to `` drive '' the hamiltonian and the system by changing the free parameters @xmath16 of the whole hamiltonian @xmath17 of the three partite system @xmath9 @xmath18 where @xmath16 are the parameters that correspond to the degrees of freedom that we control locally at site @xmath2 . now",
    "the question is how much entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be created by tuning the parameters @xmath19 .",
    "the answer depends on the choice of the interaction hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the local control at site @xmath2 . in the following",
    "we discuss this dependence as well as the choice of different @xmath2 s .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we address the case where all three systems @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are two dimensional systems , that is qubits .",
    "we introduce the most general form of hamiltonian consistent with the assumptions and demonstrate the method on a particular example . in the third section we consider a more complicated case of the dicke model , where the role of the systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 are played by atoms interacting with an electromagnetic field - the system @xmath2 . here",
    "different approximations of the field are analyzed . in the last section",
    "we discuss various strategies as well as limits of the method and summarize our results .",
    "we start with the case where the systems @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are represented by two - dimensional hilbert spaces and called qubits . in such case",
    "we can write the hamiltonian @xmath3 as a sum of direct products of pauli matrices and the identity operator @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the identity operator @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the set of three pauli matrices for each @xmath25 .",
    "it means that @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in what follows",
    "we drop the subscript on operators labeling the system as the position of an operator in a product uniquely specifies to which system the operator corresponds .",
    "real constants , @xmath29 , @xmath30 define the interaction hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "in the same way the real coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 uniquely define the hamiltonian @xmath4 @xmath33    by local control on site @xmath2 we understand that we have a choice in tuning the local hamiltonian @xmath34 and more specifically parameters @xmath35 specifying the hamiltonian @xmath36 note that in this case we did not include the case @xmath37 as such term only shifts energy levels but it does not essentially change the structure of the spectrum and eigenvectors .",
    "it means that the set of parameters @xmath16 we control are identified with the three parameters @xmath35 , @xmath24 . to see how it works",
    "let us consider the following example .",
    "the ising interaction between the sites @xmath0 and @xmath2 is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the interaction constant and @xmath40 is the pauli operator .",
    "recalling the notation introduced above we obtain that @xmath41 and all other coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath42 are zero . the interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    "is chosen to be the same as it is the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the hamiltonian @xmath4 reads @xmath43 the physical situation that could be described by the interaction hamiltonians is following .",
    "assume that the three systems @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are of the same type .",
    "in such case also the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath2 or @xmath2 and @xmath1 is of the same origin .",
    "subsequently if the three systems are positioned in a line and equally spaced then the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is small , in practice negligible , while the interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath1 are described by the same hamiltonian as it is in our case .",
    "the local hamiltonians @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the ising model are of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy separation between the upper and lower energy level of the two - level system and @xmath46 is the pauli operator . for spin systems the parameter @xmath45 is proportional to the magnitude of the external magnetic field that is responsible for the splitting of the two energy levels when the spin is placed in the magnetic field .",
    "similarly , the hamiltonian @xmath34 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy separation between the two energy levels of the system @xmath2 .",
    "for convenience we rewrite the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath48 as @xmath49 and @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 are chosen to be @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are dimensionless . in this notation , the parameter that represents the control that we have over the system @xmath2 is the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "change in the parameter @xmath54 corresponds to the change of the strength of the external field at site @xmath2 which determines the energy separation between the two levels of the system @xmath2 .    in what follows",
    "we discuss different choices of local hamiltonians @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the hamiltonian @xmath34 corresponding to the local control at site @xmath2 .",
    "we start with the case where the local terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 are zero which means that the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the system @xmath17 is a sum of three terms ( [ izab ] ) , ( [ izbc ] ) and ( [ izlb ] ) and the corresponding eigenspectrum can be calculated analytically ( see app .",
    "[ apiz ] ) .",
    "due to all of the eigenvectors are factorized it follows immediately that there is no entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 irrespective of the local hamiltonian @xmath34 .",
    "that is by locally controlling the system @xmath2 it is not possible to create entanglement shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "note that the degeneracy of the ground state opens a chance to create a state with the lowest energy such that it is entangled .",
    "however , as we can create an eigenstate with the same energy but no entanglement , we will not consider such vector as an entangled ground state .",
    "a similar situation occurs when the local hamiltonians @xmath5 and @xmath6 are large ( large means dominant compared with the interaction terms ) so that the parameter @xmath55 is much larger than @xmath57 , that is @xmath58 .",
    "large energy separation between two levels of systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 causes that both of the systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to be in their ground state .",
    "it follows that the state of the subsystem @xmath15 is close to a product of the two ground states , and hence there is no entanglement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "modifying @xmath34 can not change this as the interaction terms are weak compared with the local hamiltonians @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    on the other hand when the local terms are comparable to the interaction terms or even better when they are small but non - zero the situation changes significantly .",
    "first let us consider the local terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 to be small ( but non - zero ) in comparison with the interaction terms .",
    "it means that the parameter @xmath55 fulfills the relation @xmath59 . in such case",
    "we can consider the local terms to be a perturbation to the full hamiltonian and calculate the energy levels using the expansion series . as we have already pointed out for the ising model without the local terms @xmath5 and @xmath34 the ground state is degenerate and the two levels with the lowest energy are @xmath60 . if we include the local terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the full hamiltonian we remove the degeneracy and the ground state becomes non - degenerate .",
    "calculating the ground state to the first order in the parameter @xmath55 with the help of the expansion to the second order ( the first order neither removes the degeneracy nor modifies the spectrum but modifies the form of the two ground states ) we obtained the state of the form @xmath61 \\ ; \\right \\ }   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the complex constants @xmath11 , @xmath62 depend on @xmath54 , @xmath63 is a normalization constant and the normalized states @xmath64 are defined in app .  [ apiz ] .",
    "for @xmath55 small this vector represents an entangled state and for @xmath65 the ground state approaches maximally entangled state . though not explicitly shown in the last equation change in the parameter @xmath54 causes change in the state ( as not only the constants @xmath11 but also the states @xmath64 depend on @xmath54 ) and in turn changes the entanglement shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . on the other hand it should be pointed out that the maximal entanglement can be reached only in the limit @xmath66 and in the same limit the gap between the ground state and the first excited state vanishes .",
    "it means that if we want to increase the maximal amount of entanglement that can be produced between @xmath0 and @xmath1 we have to reduce the gap between the two lowest energy levels . as a result of that the cooling of the system ( we want our system to stay in the ground state during the whole evolution ) is more problematic . the complete picture for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ graf2 ] ) .     shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , expressed as a concurrence ( for definition see app .  [ concu ] ) , on the local control at site @xmath2 , parameter @xmath54 , and for different one - particle hamiltonians @xmath5 and @xmath6 , parameter @xmath55.,width=321 ]    using simple interaction of ising type we have shown that it is possible to control ( generate ) entanglement between essentially distant parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "what is important to realize is the fact that the two systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not allowed to interact and the entanglement is created only through the interaction with the system @xmath2 . in addition , by modifying the site @xmath2 , that is parameters of the local hamiltonian @xmath34 , it is possible to control the amount of entanglement shared by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in our example",
    "the maximal entanglement is actually never reached though we can get arbitrarily close to the maximal possible value .",
    "we address this issue in a more detail in the last section .",
    "in our scenario the entanglement between the two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 is generated through the interaction with an auxiliary quantum system at the site @xmath2 and depends on the choice of the local hamiltonian @xmath67 .",
    "that is it depends on the physical nature of the system @xmath2 . in the previous section",
    "the system @xmath2 was composed of a single qubit .",
    "the situation analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered as a particular case of our scenario where the system @xmath2 is a collection of spins and the whole system @xmath9 forms a spin chain .",
    "it is natural that for different physical systems @xmath2 we obtain different results .",
    "what is not so obvious is the fact that different results are obtained also for different models of a given physical system . here by different models we have in mind different approximations of the physical situation .",
    "in order to see the problem more clearly we analyze the physical setup composed of two non - interacting atoms placed in a cavity interacting with one mode electromagnetic field .",
    "as the two atoms do not interact directly the entanglement can be created only via interaction with the electromagnetic field . here",
    "different approximations lead to different models for the field and one can consider several hamiltonians .",
    "if we assume a dipole and rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and restrict to the case of small interaction between the field and the atomic system , then the system can be described by dicke hamiltonian @xcite . @xmath68",
    "where the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the three operators @xmath71 , @xmath72,@xmath73 are pauli operators , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are field creation and annihilation operators , @xmath76 is the radiation field frequency and @xmath77 is the atomic transition frequency .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 is proportional to the coupling strength between field and atoms .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian is a good starting point in the analysis of the radiation - matter interaction systems , since it can be analytically solved @xcite and describes various ( especially collective and cooperative ) properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if we want to study the system with stronger radiation - atom interaction we must drop the rotating wave - approximation ( i.e. it is important to include counter - rotating terms to the hamiltonian ) and in addition an extra quadratic field term , usually neglected , have to be taken into account . when the counter - resonant terms are added the hamiltonian is of the form : @xmath79 and when in addition the quadratic field term is included the hamiltonian reads(for more details see ref .  ?",
    ") : @xmath80 in both of the hamiltonians @xmath81 and @xmath82 the parameter @xmath83 denotes the coupling between field and matter and the parameter @xmath54 that appears in @xmath82 is not a free parameter but it is proportional to @xmath84 ( for more details see ref .  ? ?",
    "the quadratic term in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : dicke3 ] ) is not only necessary for the cases of stronger interactions from the physical point of view , but it is also useful for the mathematical analysis , how an extra non - interaction term included into the hamiltonian influences the properties of the system .     of the two atoms in the cavity as a function of the coupling @xmath83 for three different types of hamiltonians @xmath85 ( black solid line ) , @xmath86 ( red dashed line ) and @xmath87 ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "the behavior of the bi - partite entanglement in the two atom system is clearly different for the three hamiltonians .",
    "the amount of quantum correlation in the system depends on and thus can be controlled by the strength of the interaction .",

    "finally , we will compare the results .",
    "since atoms are described as two - level quantum systems , we will use the concurrence of a reduced bipartite atomic system as an entanglement measure .",
    "firstly , we focus on how the quadratic field term in hamiltonian @xmath82 influences the bi - partite entanglement , comparing to the hamiltonians without this term ( @xmath85 and @xmath81 ) . from all tree hamiltonians",
    ", only hamiltonian @xmath85 can be diagonalized analytically @xcite , therefore we have done an numeric analysis and we will discuss the results on figures .",
    "it is apparent from the fig .",
    "[ fig : entanglement1 ] that the bi - partite atomic entanglement is significantly different in the three cases studied .",
    "the main property of the concurrence for the hamiltonians @xmath85 and @xmath81 ( i.e. without non - interacting term ) is that their values drop to @xmath88 very quickly . on the other hand",
    "the presence of the quadratic non - interacting field term in @xmath82 ensures that the quantum correlations persist also in the cases of strong interaction between field and atomic system .",
    "in addition , two atoms are ( in average ) more entangled compared with the previous cases as it can be seen from the fig .",
    "[ fig : entanglement1 ] .",
    "further , let us separately study how the bi - partite entanglement in the atomic system is controlled by the strength of the interaction ( parameter @xmath78 ) and the size of the quadratic term ( parameter @xmath54 ) in the case of the complete hamiltonian @xmath82 .",
    "we note that this is rather mathematical approach since @xmath54 is not independent from the coupling ( @xmath89 ) but it can illuminate how the non - interacting field term can have an influence on the entanglement between individual atoms - even for fixed coupling @xmath78 . again , all calculations were made numerically and our results will be discussed with the help of the fig .  [",

    "( concurrence ) between the two atoms as a function of the coupling @xmath78 and the parameter @xmath90 .",

    "these get stronger as the interaction between field and atomic system increases ( increasing @xmath78 ) or when we independently increase the quadratic term ( increasing @xmath90 ) .",
