    "a fundamental item in the theoretical modeling of a josephson junction is the dependency of the supercurrent @xmath0 flowing through it on the phase difference @xmath1 across the junction .",
    "golubov , kupriyanov and ilichev published a recent review on the subject.@xcite as this relation is necessarily @xmath2-periodic and odd,@xcite it can be expressed as the following fourier series ( with the critical current @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 @xmath5 is known as ( super-)current - phase relationship or cpr , the dimensionless term @xmath6 as normalized cpr . for vanishing transparency ( e.g.  a tunnel junction ) , only @xmath7 is relevant , reducing eq .",
    "[ cpr_fourier ] to the well - known dc josephson@xcite equation @xmath8 junctions with direct ( i.e.  non - tunnel ) conductivity , such as the nb / inas(2des)/nb weak links used in this work , are predicted to show more complex behavior and a non - sinusoidal cpr due to higher order processes of charge transport such as multiple andreev reflections.@xcite indications of a significant non - harmonic term in our junctions have been found in microwave measurements.@xcite we are interested in experimental access to the cpr as a way to test and improve the theoretical models describing our junctions , since the conduction mechanisms in these devices are still not fully understood .",
    "the measurements deliver not only the dependency @xmath6 , but also @xmath3 , thus offering an independent comparison to transport measurements .",
    "the first extensive theoretical works concerning high transparency superconducting weak links were published by kulik and omelyanchuk for a short quasiclassical point contact in the dirty limit@xcite @xmath9 ( with mean free path @xmath10 and coherence length @xmath11 ) and for the clean limit@xcite @xmath12 , predicting a cpr @xmath6 changing from a sinusoidal curve to a saw tooth shape for high transparencies and low temperatures .",
    "these idealized model systems serve to understand the basic mechanisms leading to a deviation of the cpr from the well - known josephson relation ( eq .",
    "[ dcjosephson ] ) , which we encounter also in complex real - world junctions , though mixed with secondary processes .",
    "mechanically controlled break - junctions@xcite come closest to the assumptions of the theory of kulik and omelyanchuk .",
    "cpr measurements by a flux - detecting method in this system@xcite agreed with the predicted changes in the position of the maximum and curve shape .",
    "in contrast to these systems , our sns junctions exhibit a finite length , some scattering of electrons in the 2des , and an area of induced superconductivity around the electrodes caused by the proximity effect . to take these properties into account and to describe the non - sinusoidal cpr in our experiments , we used the scattering matrix formalism@xcite to derive a formula for the josephson current through a double - barrier structure:@xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the resistance quantum , @xmath15 is the coefficient of the andreev reflection at the inas(2deg)/inas interface and @xmath16 are the elements of the scattering matrix for normal reflection in a symmetric double barrier junction@xcite @xmath17 , @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 are the reflection and transmission probabilities of the left and right - hand barrier , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are matsubara frequencies , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are components normal to the barriers of the wave vector and fermi velocity , respectively , of the @xmath24-th transverse mode to the barriers and @xmath25 is the distance between them . following the btk approach,@xcite the reflection and transmission coefficients can be written in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dimensionless potential barrier strength and @xmath28 is the fermi velocity mismatch .    in order to calculate the josephson current from eq .",
    "[ eq : in ] , one must determine the andreev reflection coefficient @xmath15 for the inas(2deg)/inas interface .",
    "since superconductivity is induced in inas by the proximity effect , the coefficient @xmath15 may be written as @xcite @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are green functions in the inversion layer of inas . due to the low electron density of the inversion",
    "layer the suppression of the pair potential in nb can be neglected and @xmath32 can be expressed by the mcmillan equations@xcite @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the transparency between nb and inas , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the superconducting energy gap of bulk nb , and @xmath40 its critical temperature . both the critical temperature and the energy gap of the nb can be suppressed near the interface because of disorder @xcite but @xmath41 remains constant .",
    "@xcite since @xmath40 can be determined from temperature measurement , there are only two free fitting parameters in the model , the carrier density @xmath42 and @xmath36 ( we assume @xmath43 , i.e.  no real barrier ) .",
    "the fermi velocity @xmath44 and fermi wave vector @xmath45 are calculated for a given value of @xmath42 . since the normal resistance depends on @xmath42 as well",
    ", the @xmath42 obtained from the fit can be verified comparing the theoretical and experimental value of the resistance .",
    "temperature dependence of the critical current .",
    "circles are experimental data , the solid line presents a fit using the model described in the text .",
    "the inset shows a schematic cross section of the josephson junction.[1095 - 21a_ict],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the superconductor used in our sns junctions is a nb thin film , the normal conductor is the two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) that forms as naturally occurring inversion layer at the surface of bulk p - type inas . the inas surface is cleaned in situ using low - energy ar etching prior to the deposition of a 100 nm thick nb film by magnetron sputtering , yielding the highly transparent interfaces required to observe deviations from sinusoidal cpr .",
    "the structures are patterned using standard optical and electron - beam lithography .",
    "we are using an overlapping sample geometry ( see inset of fig .  [ qoverlap ] ) , where we can set the electrode separation @xmath25 with nm accuracy using anodic oxidation to grow the insulating nb@xmath46o@xmath47 interlayer . at a typical electron density of @xmath48",
    "@xmath49 and mobility of @xmath50 @xmath51/vs , the mean free path of @xmath52 nm is much longer than the electrode separation @xmath53 nm . from the dependence of the critical current on the channel length , we estimate the coherence length @xmath54 nm at 1.8 k. thus we have a ballistic ( @xmath55 ) superconducting weak link in the short limit ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "more details have been published by  @xcite    the use of the native 2des on p - type inas is not without difficulties , as it forms on every surface of the crystal .",
    "thus it offers parallel conduction paths , resulting in significant bypass currents around the junction , which reduce the normal resistance @xmath57 .",
    "measured phase shift at various temperatures.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the cpr of the josephson junction is determined by an inductive rf frequency method requiring no galvanic contacts to the sample , thus reducing noise .",
    "this technique is based on the work of rifkin and deaver.@xcite the junction to be investigated is incorporated into a superconducting loop .",
    "this loop forms an rf squid of inductance @xmath58 , which is coupled inductively to a high quality tank circuit in resonance .",
    "the phase difference @xmath1 across the junction can be biased by an external magnetic flux @xmath59 via a dc current @xmath60 .",
    "changes in the impedance of the coupled system are measured and can be used to reconstruct the cpr .",
    "further details are given in ref .  .",
    "this method requires low critical currents @xmath3 of the junction and low inductances @xmath58 of the squid washer , as the squid enters the hysteretic regime when @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the normalized critical current and @xmath63 .",
    "in the hysteretic mode the internal magnetic flux as a function of the external one becomes multivalued , preventing us to reconstruct the cpr in the complete phase range @xmath64 .",
    "the challenge is to reduce @xmath3 and @xmath58 while maintaining excellent interface transparency , large @xmath65 products , and sufficient coupling to the tank circuit .",
    "we achieve this by reducing the geometric dimensions of the junction and the loop and by complex washer designs .",
    "the presented junction is connected to six squid washers in parallel with an integrated flux transformer , for an inductance of @xmath66  ph and optimized coupling to the tank circuit .",
    "a similar transformer is described and depicted in ref .  .",
    "the experiments are performed on an overlapping josephson junction of width @xmath67 m and electrode separation @xmath68 nm .",
    "transport measurements at 1.8  k result in @xmath69a , @xmath70 , @xmath71v , and show clearly developed subharmonic gap structures ( sgs ) in the differential resistance of the junction .",
    "this indicates high interface quality and transparency of the junctions .",
    "figure  [ cprrawdata ] shows the recorded phase shift @xmath72 in the tank circuit as a function of the applied quasi - dc current @xmath60 ramping the external flux @xmath59 through the squid loop .",
    "this signal was averaged for 20 periods to reduce noise and then used to reconstruct the cpr depicted in fig .",
    "[ overlapcpr ] . for decreasing temperatures , gradual deviation of the cpr from conventional sinusoidal behavior towards a sawtooth - shaped curve is observed .",
    "the position of maximum current is shifted to @xmath73 at 1.3 k. at the same time , the critical current increases substantially , so that at some temperature the squid enters the hysteretic regime as @xmath74 approaches unity . in that case",
    "we are no longer able to reconstruct the cpr at lower temperatures .",

    "a pure sine curve is included.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the @xmath75 dependence was fitted by the model described above using the least squares method with two fitting parameters @xmath42 and @xmath36 .",
    "the other parameters used in the calculation were determined independently as critical temperature @xmath76 k , width @xmath77 m , electrode separation @xmath53 nm , interface parameter @xmath43 , and fermi velocity mismatch @xmath78 .",
    "the fitting procedure yields the parameters @xmath79 @xmath49 and @xmath80 and good agreement between theoretical and experimental data ( see figs .",
    "[ 1095 - 21a_ict ] and [ overlapcpr ] ) .",
    "note that the model fits the current - phase characteristic quite well for the parameters determined from the temperature dependence of the critical current .",
    "only the curve taken at @xmath81 k exhibits some deviation from the theoretical one .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath82 is rather steep at low temperatures and a small difference between the temperature of the thermometer and the sample could be responsible . from the above parameters we calculate the junction resistance of @xmath83 .",
    "transport measurements yield a slightly lower value of @xmath84 , but as we measure a parallel connection between substrate and junction , a higher junction resistance is to be expected",
    ". a realistic substrate resistance of @xmath85 produces the measured value of @xmath84 .",
    "the interface parameters indicate a highly transparent junction .",
    "the assumed carrier density is about three times the result @xmath86 @xmath49 from shubnikov - de haas measurements on comparable samples .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath42 as determined from our model is consistent with the smaller experimental value of the junction resistance .",
    "a possible explanation for both effects is an effective widening of the contact due to the proximity effect in the surrounding 2des .",
    "we have successfully measured the current - phase relationship ( cpr ) of a nb / inas(2des)/nb josephson junction in dependence of temperature . at low temperatures , substantial deviations of the cpr from a sinusoidal behavior towards a saw tooth shape are observed .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with predictions of the kulik - omelyanchuk theory for highly transparent sns junctions and the measurements on josephson field effect transistors presented in ref .  .",
