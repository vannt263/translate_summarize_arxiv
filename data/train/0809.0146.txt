    "[ sec : relcrosscos ] , @xmath87 [ eq .  ( [ eq : xsecttwocospar ] ) ] is proportional to  @xmath2 and thus is well - suited to examine the molecular motion .",
    "the sequence imprints an oscillatory occurrence and vanishing of enhanced alignment and antialignment .",
    "this rotational motion is enforced by the laser and only present during the pulse sequence .",
    "afterwards , @xmath129 , we see  by comparison with the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cos2t_7 ] ( keep in mind that @xmath2 is plotted there)that the free time - evolution after a single pulse is approximately assumed .",
    "the ratios  @xmath126 and @xmath127 are complementary : the former peaks where the latter is minimal .    likewise , the ratios of cross sections corresponding to the physical situation in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cos2t_7 ] can be investigated where a single , short laser pulse creates a rotational wavepacket . about every @xmath130 ,",
    "the molecule undergoes short time intervals of transient antialignment .",
    "the brief periods of antialignment then lead to brief periods of transparency of the sample for x  rays , i.e. , x - ray bursts of a few picoseconds may be cut out of a longer x - ray pulse . we have constructed a picosecond clock which provides us with short x - ray bursts .",
    "for very long x - ray pulses , several bursts with a well - defined recurrence time can be generated .",
    "control of x - ray absorption with laser - aligned molecules has advantages and disadvantages compared with the competing technique of eit for x  rays .",
    "@xcite an advantage of molecular alignment over eit is that by the choice of the molecule , x - ray absorption can be controlled for a large number of wavelengths , i.e. , by replacing  cf@xmath0br with other molecules , one can shift the absorption edge over a wide range of energies .",
    "additionally , other edges , @xmath131 , @xmath19 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , can be used alternatively without any extra effort .",
    "this adds an additional degree of freedom of available x - ray wavelengths . in the case of eit for x  rays , on the other hand",
    ", the number of suitable atoms seems to be quite limited by the requirements to sustain strong laser fields and the availability of intense laser systems with the right wavelength to couple two empty rydberg orbitals .",
    "also with molecular alignment , absorption can be controlled for hard x  rays where @xmath18-shell core - hole decay widths are large and eit for x  rays is suppressed .",
    "@xcite    let us estimate the required length of cf@xmath0br  gas where the laser and the x  rays need to overlap for the proposed x - ray pulse shaping to work .",
    "we approximate the cross section of cf@xmath0br on the pre - edge resonance by the @xmath136  cross section for krypton atoms  @xmath137 .",
    "@xcite let the gas jet have a number density of  @xmath138 as it had in the experiment of ref .  . from beer s law ,",
    "@xcite we estimate that the overlap region needs to be  @xmath139  long for the x - ray flux to drop by a factor of  @xmath140 .",
    "clearly , this is an absurd requirement in practice .",
    "a number density of  @xmath141 would be required to reduce the length of the overlap region to  @xmath142 . yet",
    "the number density in the gas jet can not be increased indefinitely because the molecules start to interact strongly with each other forming clusters and , eventually , a condensed phase .",
    "the x - ray cross section assumed in this estimate holds for perfectly aligned molecules parallel to the x - ray polarization direction . with laser - alignment , this cross section can be reduced to zero for perfectly antialigned molecules .",
    "note that the cross section is about a hundred times larger for neon atoms than for krypton atoms .",
    "@xcite the estimate with respect to the fluorine pre - edge resonance is thus far more favorable than for bromine . on the down side of molecular alignment over eit",
    "is that the time scales of the former is about three orders of magnitude slower ( picoseconds ) than the latter ( femtoseconds ) .",
    "the molecules need to have a low rotational temperatures , too ; it is not yet clear whether this is physically possible because interactions between molecules have a considerable damping influence on molecular rotations in denser gases and condensed matter .",
    "@xcite the latter points seem to represent a big , if not insurmountable , obstacle for control of x - ray absorption by laser - manipulated molecular rotation",
    ". however , the ideas presented in this subsection might nevertheless prove fruitful in conjunction with recent work on the laser - alignment of molecules in solution .  @xcite",
    "this study is devoted to laser - induced rotational dynamics of bromotrifluoromethane  ( cf@xmath0br )  molecules probed by x  rays .",
    "first , we investigated the molecular rotations in terms of the expectation value  @xmath2 .",
    "second , we investigate the properties of a probe of molecular rotations by x  rays .",
    "this represents an alternative to the established coulomb - explosion technique .",
    "@xcite third , we explore possibilities to employ laser manipulation of molecular rotation to control x - ray pulse shapes , i.e. , to imprint a certain pulse shape onto a longer x - ray pulse .",
    "we start by investigating  @xmath2 . specifically , we examine its temporal evolution for varying laser - pulse durations , its temperature dependence , and its dependence on the peak laser intensity .",
    "then , we revisit these physical situations with short - pulse x  rays . additionally , we explore the dependence on the x - ray pulse duration and the relation between the maximum of x - ray absorption and the maximum of  @xmath2 .",
    "we show that  @xmath2 can be directly measured by short - pulse x - ray absorption measurements .",
    "such short pulses will be produced by the emerging ultrafast x - ray sources .",
    "@xcite the method permits to stroboscopically photograph the steps in the time - evolution of rotational wavepackets . we can learn about the beams and the experimental conditions ; x - ray absorption is an _ in situ _ probe .",
    "our investigations are based on our recent theory  @xcite for the laser alignment of symmetric - top molecules probed by x  rays . to carry out the computations in this paper , we devise a parameter - free two - level model for the electronic structure of  cf@xmath0br",
    "; it models the br@xmath143  pre - edge resonance . the x - ray absorption cross section formula from ref .",
    "is reduced to this model .",
    "we employ coupled - cluster linear - response techniques to determine the average dynamic dipole polarizability and the dynamic dipole polarizability anisotropy for  cf@xmath0br in the laser light . finally , the usual temperature - independent criterion of adiabaticity for the laser pulse duration  @xmath144 looses its predictive power because the rotational response becomes more and more adiabatic with increasing rotational temperature .",
    "therefore , we devise a thermally averaged rotational period as a new adiabaticity criterion for rotational dynamics .",
    "based on our work , a number of future prospects offer themselves .",
    "absolute cross sections can be easily determined parametrizing the two - level model fully with the cross section on the br@xmath143  pre - edge resonance for molecules perfectly aligned along the x - ray polarization axis .",
    "this parameter can be experimentally determined for clamped molecules on surfaces  @xcite or computationally using _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "our rigid - rotor model has a few limitations .",
    "no vibrations or internal rotations were accounted for . in future work",
    ", such effects beyond the rigid - rotor approximation should be addressed .",
    "additionally , our formalism can be extended to three - dimensional alignment of asymmetric - top molecules .",
    "@xcite this enables one to study a large class of molecules which basically do not rotate .",
    "our proposal to use laser - aligned molecules to control x - ray pulse shapes offers a higher flexibility in terms of the suitable x - ray energies than electromagnetically induced transparency for x  rays which has been studied only for rare - gas atoms so far .",
    "@xcite chemical shifts of the inner - shell edges offer an added flexibility to manipulate the resonance energies of molecules compared with atoms .",
    "to control x  rays by laser - aligned molecules in practice , one has to experimentally produce a cold beam of molecules with sufficiently high number density .",
    "however , at present , this requirement seems to inhibit a success of this technique both in principle and in practice .",
    "further , one has to make theoretical advancements to predict the signal of such experiments . at the required number densities ,",
    "one faces condensed - matter ; the interactions with neighboring molecules are strong and need to be incorporated in terms of a more comprehensive theory .  @xcite the laser pulses need to be shaped such that a desired rotational dynamics is imposed on the molecules .",
    "approaches to the quantum control of molecular alignment have been derived , e.g. , refs .",
    "offering perspectives for an optimal control of the rotational dynamics of molecules and , in this way , an optimal , ultrafast ( picoseconds ) control of x - ray pulse shapes .",

    "two basic mechanisms can lead to a failure of this prediction .",
    "the first mechanism is symmetry breaking induced by molecular vibrations .",
    "we consider this effect to be negligible for the following reason .",
    "laser - induced alignment in the gas phase requires rotationally cold molecules .",
    "we may therefore assume that before absorbing an x - ray photon , the molecules are in the electronic and vibrational ground state .",
    "@xcite hence , it is only vibrations in the core - excited resonance state that could break the c@xmath31 symmetry of cf@xmath0br .",
