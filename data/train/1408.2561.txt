    "the detection of strong emission lines has become an essential method in extra - galactic astronomy to find distant star - forming galaxies @xcite .",

    "a detailed examination of this galaxy population has diverse implications for galaxy formation , reionization and the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "attempts to fully exploit the physical information included in the line require an understanding of all the physical factors involved in shaping the line .",
    "due to the resonant nature of this line , these physical factors notably include temperature , density and bulk velocity field of the neutral hydrogen in the emitting galaxy and its surroundings .",

    "analytic studies of configurations including some kind of bulk flow only include the case of a sphere with a hubble like expansion flow @xcite .",
    "a more detailed quantitative description of the line has been reached through monte carlo simulations @xcite . in the last two decades",
    "these studies have become popular due to the availability of computing power . early into the 21st century , the first studies focused on homogeneous and static media @xcite .",
    "later on , the effects of clumpy media @xcite and expanding / contracting shell / spherical geometries started to be studied @xcite . for a recent review ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "similar codes have applied these results to semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite and results of large hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , monte carlo codes have also been applied to the results of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , recent developments have been focused on the systematic study of clumpy outflows @xcite and anisotropic velocity configurations @xcite .",
    "the recent studies of galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations @xcite have all shown systematic variations in the line with the viewing angle .",
    "these variations are a complex superposition of anisotropic density configurations ( i.e. edge - on vs. face - on view of a galaxy ) , the inflows observed by gas cooling and the outflows included in the supernova feedback process of the simulation .",
    "these bulk flows physically correspond to the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium ( cgm and igm ) .",
    "these effects are starting to be studied in simplified configurations that vary the density and wind characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , in all these efforts the effect of rotation , which is an ubiquitous feature in galaxies , has not been systematically studied .",
    "the processing of the photons in a rotating interstellar medium ( ism ) must have some kind of impact in the line morphology .    performing",
    "that study is the main goal of this paper .",
    "we investigate for the first time the impact of rotation on the morphology of the line .",
    "we focus on a simplified system : a spherical gas cloud with homogeneous density and solid body rotation , to study the line morphology and the escape fraction in the presence of dust .",
    "we base our work on two independent monte carlo based radiative transfer codes presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  [ sec : implementation ] we present the implementation of bulk rotation into the monte carlo codes , paying special attention to coordinate definitions .",
    "we also present a short review of how the radiative transfer codes work and list the different physical parameters in the simulated grid of models . in  [ sec : results ] we present the results of the simulations , with special detail to quantities that show a clear evolution as a function of the sphere rotational velocity . in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our results . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "the appendix presents the derivation of an analytic expression to interpret the main trends observed in the monte carlo simulations .    in this paper",
    "we express a photon s frequency in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath3 , where @xmath4 hz is the ly@xmath0 resonance frequency , @xmath5 is the doppler broadening of the line which depends on the neutral gas temperature @xmath6 or equivalently the thermal velocity @xmath7 of the atoms .",
    "we also use the parameter @xmath8 to define the relative line width as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the intrinsic linewidth .",
    "for the temperature @xmath11k used in our radiative transfer calculations the thermal velocity is @xmath12 .",
    "describing the kinematics of gas rotation in all generality is a complex task , specially at high redshift where there is still missing a thorough observational account of rotation in galaxies beyond @xmath13 . even at low redshifts",
    "there is a great variation in the shape of the rotation curve as observed in hi emission as a function of the distance to the galaxy center .",
    "however there are two recurrent features .",
    "first , in the central galactic region the velocity increases proportional to the radius , following a solid rotation behavior .",
    "second , beyond a certain radius the rotation curve tends to flatten .",
    "an ab - initio description of such realistic rotation curves in simulations depends on having access to the dynamic evolution of all mass components in the galaxy : stars , gas and dark matter .",
    "such level of realism is extremely complex to achieve , specially if one wants to get a systematic description based on statistics of simulated objects .    following the tradition of studies of emitting systems , we implement a model with simplified geometry .",
    "we assume that the gas is homogeneously distributed in a sphere that rotates as a solid body with constant angular velocity .",
    "this simple model will contain only one free parameter : the linear velocity at the sphere s surface , @xmath14 .      in the monte carlo code",
    "we define a cartesian coordinate system to describe the position of each photon .",
    "the origin of this system coincides with the center of the sphere and the rotation axis is defined to be @xmath15-axis . with this choice",
    ", the components of the gas bulk velocity field , @xmath16 , can be written as    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the radius of the sphere and @xmath21 is the linear velocity at the sphere s surface .",
    "the minus / plus sign in the @xmath22/@xmath23-component of the velocity indicates the direction of rotation . in this case",
    "we take the angular velocity in the same direction as the @xmath24 unit vector . with these definitions",
    "we can write the norm of the angular velocity as @xmath25 .",
    "for each photon in the simulation we have its initial position inside the sphere , direction of propagation @xmath26 and reduced frequency @xmath27 . the photon s propagation stops once they cross the surface of the sphere . at this point we store the position , the outgoing direction of propagation @xmath28 and the reduced frequency @xmath29 .",
    "we now define the angle @xmath30 by @xmath31 , it is the angle of the outgoing photons with respect to the direction of the angular velocity .",
    "we use the variable @xmath32 to study the anisotropy induced by rotation .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] shows the geometry of the problem and the important variables .    .",
    "in order to describe the departures from spherical symmetry we use the polar angle @xmath30 formed by the direction of the outgoing photons with respect to the @xmath15-axis .",
    "we define define the variable @xmath33 to report to present our results .",
    "computing the spectra for photons in a narrow range of @xmath32 is equivalent to having a line - of - sight oriented in that direction .",
    "[ fig : geometry],scaledwidth=40.0% ]                      here we briefly describe the relevant characteristics of the two radiative transfer codes we have used . for a detailed description",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the codes follow the individual scatterings of photons as they travel through a 3d distribution of neutral hydrogen . the frequency of the photon ( in the laboratory frame ) and its direction of propagation change at every scattering .",
    "this change in frequency is due to the peculiar velocities of the hydrogen absorbing and re - emitting the photon . once the photons escape the gas distribution we store their direction of propagation and frequency at their last scattering .",
    "the initialization process for the photons specifies its position , frequency and direction of propagation .",
    "we select the initial frequency to be exactly the rest - frame frequency in the gas reference frame and the direction of propagation to be random following an flat probability distribution over the sphere .",
    "it means that for photons emitted from the center of the sphere @xmath34 , while photons emitted at some radii with a peculiar velocity @xmath35 have initial values @xmath27 depending on its direction of propagation : @xmath36 .",
    "we do not include the effect of turbulent velocities in the initialization .",
    "we neglect this given that the induced perturbation should be on the close to the thermal velocity , @xmath37 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the velocity widths ( @xmath38-@xmath39 ) in the static case .",
    "if dust is present , the photon can interact either with a hydrogen atom or dust grain . in the case of a dust interaction the photon",
    "can be either absorbed or scattered .",
    "this probability is encoded in the dust albedo , @xmath40 , which we chose to be @xmath41 . in order to obtain accurate values for the escape fraction of photons in the presence of dust",
    ", we do not use any accelerating mechanism in the radiative transfer .",
    "the codes treat the gas as homogeneous in density and temperature .",
    "this implies that the gas is completely defined by its geometry ( i.e. sphere or slab ) , temperature @xmath6 , hydrogen optical depth @xmath42 , dust optical depth @xmath43 and the bulk velocity field @xmath35 .      in the monte carlo calculations we follow the propagation of @xmath44 numerical photons through different spherical galaxies .",
    "for each galaxy we vary at least one of the following parameters : the maximum rotational velocity @xmath21 , the hydrogen optical depth @xmath45 , the dust optical depth @xmath46 and the initial distribution of photons with respect to the gas . in total",
    "there are @xmath47 different models combining all the possible different variations in the input parameters .",
    "table [ table : models ] lists the different parameters we used to generate the models .",
    "the results and trends we report are observed in both monte carlo codes .    .",
    "summary of physical parameters of our monte carlo simulations . [ cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now estimate the escape fraction @xmath48 for the dusty models .",
    "the main result is that we do not find any significant dependence with either the viewing angle nor the rotational velocity .",
    "this is consistent with our finding in   [ sec : intlineint ] , that radiative transfer inside the cloud does not depend on its rotational velocity . for completeness",
    "we list in table [ table : escape ] the escape fraction for all models .",
    "we now put these results in the context of the analytic solution for the infinite slab@xcite . in neufeld s",
    "set - up the analytic solution depends uniquely on the product @xmath49 where @xmath50 , valid only in the limit @xmath51 . at fixed values of @xmath46",
    "the escape fraction monotonically decreases with increasing values of @xmath42 .",
    "this expectation holds for the central sources .",
    "but in the case of homogeneous sources the escape fraction increases slightly from @xmath52 to @xmath53    the naive interpretation of the analytic solution does not seem to hold for photons emitted far from the sphere s center .",
    "we suggest that increasing @xmath42 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 causes a transition from the optically thick to the extremely optically thick regime for a noticeable fraction of the photons in the homogeneous source distribution .    in the optically thick regime",
    ", photons can escape in single flight which corresponds to a scenario in which the photon resonantly scatters @xmath56 times until it is scattered into the wing of the line ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "at these frequencies the medium is optically thin , and the photons can escape efficiently in a single flight .",
    "in contrast , in an extremely optically thick medium photons escape in a ` single excursion ' @xcite . here , photons that are scattered into the wing of the line escape from the medium in a sequence of wing scattering events . in both cases , photons resonantly scatter @xmath58-@xmath59 times . because we keep our clouds the same size , the mean free path of lya photons that scatter",
    "resonantly is 10 times larger for the case @xmath52 than for @xmath60 .",
    "if we compute the average distance @xmath61 travelled by photons through a medium of size @xmath20 as a function of line center optical depth @xmath42 , then we find that during the transition from optically thick to extremely optically thick the mean traversed distance @xmath61 actually decreases slightly .",
    "this decrease is unique to this transition region , and @xmath61 generally increases with @xmath42 at other values of @xmath42 .",
    "the number of scatterings affects the escape frequency of a photon . studying this quantity further illustrates the independence of the integrated flux and the escape fraction on rotational velocity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nscatt ] we show the average number of scatterings @xmath62 as a function of the cosinus of the outgoing angle @xmath63 and the rotational velocity @xmath21 . from the right panel",
    "observe that the number of scatterings and the outgoing angle are independent .",
    "this plot corresponds to the specific case of the central model with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , but we have verified that this holds for all models .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nscatt ] shows how the average number of scatterings is also independent from the rotational velocity .",
    "the lower number of average scatterings in the homogeneous source distribution is due to a purely geometrical effect .",
    "photons emitted close to the surface go through less scatterings before escaping .",
    "in static configurations it is expected that the optical depth correlates number of scatterings .",
    "this has been precisely quantified in the case of static infinite slab . in that model for centrally emitted sources",
    "the average number of scatterings depends only on the optical depth @xmath66 @xcite , for homogeneously distributed sources @xmath67 @xcite .    in our case",
    "we find that for the central model the number of scatterings is proportional to the optical depth , with @xmath68 for optical depth values of @xmath69 respectively .",
    "for the homogeneous sources we find that @xmath70 .",
    "there is a key result of our simulations that allows us to build an analytical description for the outgoing spectra .",
    "it is the independence of the following three quantities with the rotational velocity and the viewing angle : integrated flux , average number of scatterings and escape fraction .    as we explained in ",
    "[ sec : intlineint ] , the best way to understand this is that radiative transfer inside a sphere that undergoes solid - body rotation proceeds identical to that inside a non - rotating sphere . while scattering events off atoms within the rotating cloud impart doppler boosts on the ly@xmath0 photon , these doppler boost are only there in the lab - frame .",
    "therefore , in the frame of the rotating gas cloud all atoms are stationary with respect to each other and the scattering process proceeds identical as in the static case ( also see ",
    "[ sec : intlineint ] for an additional more quantitative explanation ) .",
    "this result allows us to analytically estimate the spectrum emerging from a rotating cloud : the spectrum of lyman @xmath0  photons emerging from a rotating gas cloud is identical as for the static case in a frame that is co - rotating with the cloud .",
    "however , the surface of cloud now moves in the lab - frame .",
    "each surface - element on the rotating cloud now has a bulk velocity with respect to a distant observer . in order to compute the spectrum",
    "one can integrate over all the surface elements in the sphere with their corresponding shift in velocity and an additional weight by the surface intensity .",
    "fig  [ fig : comparison ] shows some examples of analytic versus full mc spectra using this approach ( the implementation details are in the appendix ) .",
    "the left panel shows the results for different rotational velocities in the case of @xmath71 and an observer located perpendicular to the axis of rotation ( @xmath72 in the scheme of fig  [ fig : scheme ] in the appendix ) .",
    "the right panel shows the results for different viewing angles in the case of @xmath71 and a rotational velocity of @xmath73 .",
    "the two methods clearly give good agreement , though not perfect .",
    "in particular , the left panel shows that the mc gives rise to a spectrum that is slightly more concentrated towards the line centre .",
    "as we explain in appendix  [ sec : app ] , we do not expect perfect agreement , because this requires an analytic solution for the spectrum of ly@xmath0 photons emerging from a static , optically extremely thick cloud _ as a function of the angle at which they escape from the sphere_. this solution does not exist in the literature .",
    "it is possible to get better agreement my modifying the surface brightness profile . in any case",
    ", the analytic calculation closely captures the results obtained from the full calculations from the mc simulations . as such",
    ", they are extremely useful and provide us with a quick tool to verify our calculations at the first order level .",
    "we now compare our findings to other computational results and discuss its possible implications for the interpretation of observational data .    *",
    "escape at line center .",
    "* our models have shown that rotation enhances the flux density at line center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : differentvelocities ] ) .",
    "it has recently been proposed that galaxies with lya spectral lines that contain flux at line center may be ` leaking ' ionizing ( lyc ) photons @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this possible connection is that the escape of ionizing ( lyc ) photons requires @xmath74@xmath75 .",
    "the same low column densities facilitate the escape of photons at ( or close to ) line center .",
    "our work suggests that rotation may provide an alternative explanation .",
    "* single peaked lines*. the presence of single peaked profiles has been associated to inflow / outflow dynamics @xcite .",
    "gas bulk rotation can also be considered as a probable origin for that behaviour , provided that the observed single peak is highly symmetric .",
    "similarly , in the case of double peaked lines with a high level of flux at the line center , rotation also deserves to be considered in the pool of possible bulk flows responsible for that feature , specially if the two peaks have similar intensities .",
    "* systemic velocities*. there are observational measurements for the velocity shift between the and other emission lines . in our study",
    "we find that the position of the peak maxima can suddenly change with rotation and viewing angle .",
    "namely the line can become single peaked for high rotational velocities and viewing angles perpendicular to the rotation axis .    *",
    "galaxy simulations with gas rotation*. @xcite studied line emission in two high resolution simulations of individual galaxies .",
    "the main purpose of their study was to assess the impact of two different ism prescriptions .",
    "however , each simulated galaxy had a disc structure with a clear rotation pattern in the ism and inflowing gas from the circum - galactic region .",
    "the configuration had an axial symmetry and they reported a strong dependence of both the escape fraction and the total line intensity as a function of the @xmath30 angle .",
    "from our study , none of these two quantities has a dependence either on the inclination angle or the rotational velocity .",
    "we suggest that he effect reported by @xcite is consistent with being a consequence of the different hydrogen optical depth for different viewing angles and not as an effect of the bulk rotation .",
    "* zero impact on the escape fraction*. study of high redshift laes in numerical simulation often requires the estimation of the escape fraction in order to compare their results against observations @xcite .",
    "most of these models estimate the escape fraction from the column density of dust and neutral hydrogen .",
    "the results of our simulation indicate that the rotational velocity does not induce additional uncertainties in those estimates .",
    "in this paper we quantified for the first time in the literature the effects of gas bulk rotation in the morphology of the emission line in star forming galaxies .",
    "our results are based on the study of an homogeneous sphere of gas with solid body rotation .",
    "we explore a range of models by varying the rotational speed , hydrogen optical depth , dust optical depth and initial distribution of photons with respect to the gas density . as a cross - validation",
    ", we obtained our results from two independently developed monte - carlo radiative transfer codes .    two conclusions",
    "stand out from our study .",
    "first , rotation clearly impacts the line morphology ; the width and the relative intensity of the center of the line and its peaks are affected .",
    "second , rotation introduces an anisotropy for different viewing angles . for viewing angles close to the poles",
    "the line is double peaked and it makes a transition to a single peaked line for high rotational velocities and viewing angles along the equator .",
    "this trend is clearer for spheres with homogeneously distributed radiation sources than it is for central sources .",
    "remarkably , we find three quantities that are invariant with respect to the viewing angle and the rotational velocity : the integrated flux , the escape fraction and the average number of scatterings .",
    "these results helped us to construct the outgoing spectra of a rotating sphere as a superposition of spectra coming from a static configuration .",
    "this description is useful to describe the main quantitative features of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "quantitatively , the main results of our study are summarized as follows .",
    "* in all of our models , rotation induces changes in the line morphology for different values of the angle between the rotation axis and the los , @xmath30 .",
    "the changes are such that for a viewing angle perpendicular to the rotation axis , and high rotational velocities the line becomes single peaked .",
    "* the line width increases with rotational velocity . for a viewing angle perpendicular to the rotation axis",
    "this change approximately follows the functional form @xmath76 , where fwhm@xmath77 indicates the line width for the static case and @xmath78 is a constant .",
    "we have determined this constant to be @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the central and homogeneous source distributions , respectively .",
    "* at fixed rotational velocity the line width decreases as @xmath81 increases , i.e. the smallest value of the line width is observed for a line of sight parallel to the ration axis . *",
    "the single peaked line emerges at viewing angles @xmath82 for when the rotational velocity is close to than half the fwhm@xmath83 .    comparing our results with recent observed laes",
    "we find that morphological features such as high central line flux , single peak profiles could be explained by gas bulk rotation present in these laes .",
    "the definitive and clear impact of rotation on the morphology suggests that this is an effect that should be taken into account at the moment of interpreting high resolution spectroscopic data .",
    "in particular it is relevant to consider the joint effect of rotation the and ubiquitous outflows ( remolina - gutierrez et al .",
    ", in prep . ) because rotation can lead to enhanced escape of at line center , which has also been associated with escape of ionizing ( lyc ) photons @xcite",

    "a constant surface brightness profile requires the directional dependence for @xmath106 to correct for this .",
    "indeed , this is what is expected for the escape of ly@xmath0 photons from static , extremely opaque media ( see @xcite ; their fig  4 and accompanying discussion ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that this derivation should not be viewed as a complete analytic calculation , and we do not expect perfect agreement : we _ assumed _ a functional form for the surface brightness profile [ or for @xmath109 ] .",
