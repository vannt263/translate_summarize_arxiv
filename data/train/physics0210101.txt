    "one area of fluid mechanics that has been the subject of a large admixture of analysis , experiment and speculation is the subject of the moving contact line .",
    "a typical situation , common in many coating processes , refers to the contact line at the intersection of solid , liquid and gas regions , where the three - phase line moves relative to a solid substrate .",
    "a basic research question in this subject stems from the violation of the no - slip condition in the immediate neighborhood of the three - phase line of contact ( e.g. huh & scriven 1971 , for reviews see dussan v. ( 1979 ) , de gennes ( 1985 ) , and kistler ( 1993 ) ) . as a result , within the usual continuum analysis",
    ", the stress diverges as the contact line is approached and the energy per unit length of the moving contact line is unbounded .",
    "this result may be viewed as an embarrassment of continuum modeling , but , in fact , it does indicate the need for a small cut - off length scale in macroscopic theories , as well as some more input from the physics at smaller length scales to properly interpret the meaning of any such cut - off scale .",
    "perhaps the most basic feature of this problem is the aim to relate the local dynamic contact angle @xmath2 , which is the arc tangent of the slope of the interface at a distance @xmath3 from the contact line , to the local speed @xmath4 with which the contact line moves over the substrate . for the case of a perfectly wetting fluid ( vanishing equilibrium contact angle @xmath5 ) and small @xmath0",
    ", one finds @xmath1 , which is known as tanner s law .",
    "theoretical justification for this result has been given ( e.g. de gennes 1985 ) and various generalizations have been offered . in dimensionless form , the speed is reported in terms of the capillary number @xmath6 , which measures the relative importance of viscous to surface tension forces , where @xmath7 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath8 the interfacial tension .",
    "in fact , the functional form for the contact angle - speed relation is commonly written for small angles as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is generally taken as a molecular length ( e.g. leger & joanny 1992 ) .",
    "typically the capillary number varies over many orders of magnitude ; values @xmath11 are common .",
    "the prefactor in this formula can be important for interpreting experimental data , and so it is reasonable to interrogate more closely the functional dependence on speed .    in this communication",
    "we wish to comment on one aspect of the moving contact line problem that has , perhaps surprisingly , been largely neglected and/or unappreciated .",
    "in particular , we note that detailed models for the perfectly wetting situation actually yield a dynamic contact angle versus speed relation @xmath12where @xmath13 depends on the physical model introduced in the neighborhood of the contact line .",
    "we do not believe that it is necessarily appropriate to simply suppress the additional dependence on speed ( i.e. @xmath14 ) by replacing the argument of the logarithm by either @xmath15 , where these two lengths scales are taken as constants , or @xmath16 . because of the large variation in @xmath17 , not including this additional factor of capillary number when using ( [ contactline1 ] ) to interpret dynamical experiments may lead to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment . here",
    "we outline the basic idea behind ( [ contactline1 ] ) and present experimental evidence that supports the above interpretation .",
    "another point that has received insufficient attention is the range of validity of equation ( [ contactline1 ] ) . near the contact line ,",
    "( [ contactline1 ] ) breaks down where @xmath3 is of the same order as @xmath10 .",
    "this restriction is evident as the general structure comes from a balance of viscous and surface tension forces alone .",
    "not surprisingly , we estimate below that the microscopic scale is between several angstroms and tens of angstroms , depending on the microscopic forces assumed to be acting near the contact line .    towards large scales , @xmath3 is commonly taken to be a static scale such as the capillary length or the size of a spreading drop ( de gennes 1985 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the flow near a moving contact line often resembles a coating flow , similar to the classical problem studied by landau and levich ( e.g. levich 1962 ) .",
    "this leads to the appearance of another , _ dynamical _ length scale , that can become much smaller than the capillary length as the capillary number is small , which is typically the case .",
    "thus a meaningful comparison between ( [ contactline1 ] ) and a macroscopic measurement of the dynamical contact angle might require a spatial resolution significantly below 1/10 or even 1/100 of the capillary length .    in the next section we will introduce two different models commonly used to treat moving contact line problems such as a spreading drop or a tape plunging into a pool of fluid .",
    "then , in the third section we show that the lubrication equations corresponding to both models have similarity solutions for the interfacial shape that fix the functional dependence on the capillary number .",
    "the fourth section discusses the dynamical problem that equation ( [ contactline1 ] ) has to be matched to on an appropriate _ outer _ length scale . in the fifth section",
    "we explain measurable consequences of the two models for the dynamic contact angle , and discuss an experiment that helps to distinguish between them .",
    "we close with a summary and possible directions of future work .",
    "the usual dynamic balance for the steady flow `` far '' from the contact line involves capillary and viscous stresses .",
    "as the contact line is approached , the capillary - viscous flow leads to a stress singularity .",
    "a number of different physical effects have been suggested to relieve the singularity , and these either account for the fact that on very small length scales van der waals forces act to maintain a finite thickness liquid layer on the solid substrate , or that at very high shear rates the boundary conditions and the transport coefficients of the fluid are likely to be altered .",
    "which model is appropriate might depend on the physical system at hand , or be a combination of the above . in table",
    "[ t1 ] we provide a short overview of proposed physical models for flow in the neighborhood of a contact line ; see also mckinley & ovryn ( 1998 ) .",
    "most recently , there has been a considerable effort to base the understanding of the contact line physics on a microscopic , particle - based description , see for example koplik et al ( 1989 ) , ruijter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and abraham et al .",
    "the so - called `` diffuse interface model '' ( see e.g. seppecher ( 1996 ) , chen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and pomeau ( 2002 ) ) represents an intermediate approach , which models the liquid - gas interface as a cahn - hilliard fluid .",
    "this allows for example the extraction of effective interface equations ( pismen & pomeau ( 2000 ) ) _ different _ from those proposed by de gennes s ( 1985 ) .    below",
    "we restrict our attention to two different models which have proved particularly popular .",
    "the results are sufficient to highlight the measurable differences between different physical mechanisms . in model",
    "i , due to de gennes and coworkers ( e.g. hervet & de gennes 1982 , de gennes 1985 ) , van der waals forces are taken into account , so very close to the contact line there is a balance between surface tension and van der waals stresses alone . in model",
    "ii , proposed for example by huh and mason ( 1977 ) and hocking ( 1977 ) , the fluid is allowed to slip across the solid surface over a small slip length .",
    ".different models for the flow in the neighborhood of the contact line , with representative references .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for simplicity , we only consider the case of perfectly wetting fluids , i.e. of zero equilibrium contact angle .",
    "consistent with the local balances , the interface near the contact line remains nearly flat and we can use lubrication theory to describe the fluid motion .",
    "this approach amounts to a significant simplification of the mathematical treatment relative to the full two - dimensional flow problem ( cox 1986 ) , but agrees with the full calculation when the dynamic contact angle is small .",
    "there are numerous indications that the small - angle theory in fact remains valid for slopes of order unity .",
    "for example , @xmath18 in equation ( [ contactline1 ] ) differs by only @xmath19 from the full expression ( cox 1986 ) , derived without the benefit of lubrication theory , up to a slope of 1 .",
    "also , fermigier & jenffer ( 1991 ) reported that small - angle theory holds experimentally up to an angle of @xmath20 .    to be able to describe an experiment like a flat plate plunging with velocity @xmath4 into a reservoir of fluid ( see figure [ exp ] ) , it is necessary to include other terms beyond the lubrication terms close to the contact line .",
    "namely , we keep the full curvature term and include gravity . by doing this ,",
    "the model is able to describe the crossover to a purely static , horizontal surface far away from the dynamical region .",
    "a basic unit of length is the capillary length @xmath21 , which dictates the scale of the interface curvature far away from the contact line . in the van der",
    "waals model i , which accounts for pressure variations owing to capillary , van der waals , and gravitational forces , the equation for the _ stationary _ profile @xmath22 ( cf figure [ exp ] ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the curvature and a prime refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath3 . note that a positive @xmath14 corresponds to the plate plunging _ into _ the fluid . a brief derivation of model i , as well as model ii below",
    ", is given in appendix 1 .",
    "the microscopic length parameter @xmath25 , defined by @xmath26 measures the strength of van der waals forces relative to interfacial forces and is typically very small ( on the order of angstroms ) .",
    "another distinct approach for the flow near the contact line is to introduce slip at the boundary , consistent with allowing the contact line to move parallel to the wall at a finite speed ; the slip is a function of the shear rate .",
    "the simplest such law , introduced by navier in the same paper that also enunciated the navier - stokes equation ( navier 1823 ) , is @xmath27(see also huh & scriven 1971 ) .",
    "here @xmath4 is the speed of the moving boundary , @xmath28 denotes the solid - liquid boundary , and @xmath29 is the so - called slip length .",
    "a more complicated version of ( [ navier ] ) , in which @xmath29 is itself a non - linear function of the shear rate , has been proposed in thompson & troian ( 1997 ) . a standard calculation ( appendix 1 ) , leads to the analogue of equation ( [ pgg ] ) for the slip model ii , @xmath30 the slip length @xmath29 is usually considered to be on the order of tens of angstroms .",
    "we now focus on the immediate neighborhood of the contact line , which we assume to be at @xmath31 . owing to the flatness of the interface we can assume that @xmath32 and gravitational influences can be neglected , but dynamical ( viscous ) effects have to be included .",
    "in the case of model i , equation ( [ pgg ] ) reduces to @xmath33 to make the dependence on parameters explicit , we note that ( [ lub1 ] ) has the exact scaling solution @xmath34 where @xmath35 depends on the similarity variable @xmath36 and satisfies the equation @xmath37    similarly , the lubrication approximation for model ii gives @xmath38 in this case the scaling solutions are @xmath39 where the similarity variable is now @xmath40 and the similarity equation is @xmath41    far away from the contact line in units of the microscopic lengths @xmath25 and @xmath29 , respectively , the solutions should be the same , resulting from a balance of classical viscous forces and surface tension . indeed , as @xmath42 one finds to leading order @xmath43^{1/3 } , \\quad \\xi \\gg 1~,\\ ] ] where the numerical constants @xmath44 have to be determined by numerical integration starting from the contact line .",
    "the boundary condition at the contact line incorporates the wetting behavior of the fluid .",
    "the basic assumption is that there is a microscopic length scale on which static forces dominate over dynamical ones , and a static profile can be assumed microscopically close to the contact line .    in model",
    "i , following hervet & de gennes ( 1984 ) , we are going to match @xmath45 to a `` maximal '' film solution , corresponding to very strong wetting , whose thickness only goes to zero at ( minus ) infinity .",
    "however this maximal solution very closely approximates parabolic solutions of ( [ lub1 ] ) that go to zero at some finite contact line position ( hervet & de gennes 1984 ) . to leading order",
    ", we take the film solution to be of the form @xmath46 and defer further details to appendix 2 . using ( [ film ] ) as an initial condition with adjustable parameter @xmath47 , we integrate ( [ sim1 ] ) towards @xmath48 . the parameter @xmath47 is fixed to select the solution with vanishing curvature at infinity .",
    "figure [ compare ] compares this solution with the asymptotic form ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "we plot the rescaled slope @xmath49 from the solution of ( [ sim1 ] ) as the full curve and equation ( [ asymp ] ) with @xmath50 as the dashed curve .",
    "this numerical value for @xmath51 differs significantly from @xmath52 given in de gennes ( 1985 ) , accounting for differences in normalization .",
    "we believe the difference is simply due to the large values of @xmath53 necessary for integration until a true asymptotic value is reached .",
    "model ii , on the other hand , can be extended down to @xmath54 , since the stress singularity was successfully removed .",
    "a vanishing equilibrium contact angle @xmath5 can thus be implemented by taking the boundary condition @xmath55 at the contact line and integrating ( [ lub2 ] ) towards @xmath56 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath57 for the case of the navier slip law was given in hocking ( 1992 ) .",
    "thus the two constants , which establish the form of the interface profile , are @xmath58",
    "we now estimate the range of validity of the solution ( [ asymp ] ) as one moves farther away from the contact line . these ideas have close analogy to the classical analysis of landau and levich of a dynamical lubrication film ( levich 1962 ) .",
    "evidently , the contact line physics plays no role far away from the contact line , so the relevant lubrication equation is @xmath59 which is to be matched to a static profile at large distances .",
    "this equation has the general solution @xmath60 which has to be matched to a static meniscus on the capillary scale .",
    "this static solution is characterized by a curvature that is approximately constant , thus @xmath61 must be independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this fact forces @xmath62 , so that we have @xmath63 which implies that the crossover will occur on a scale @xmath64 , on which the logarithmic dependence in equation ( [ asymp ] ) for the slope begins to fail .",
    "the crossover to scaling of the form of equation ( [ llshape - f ] ) is demonstrated in figure [ compare ] , by showing a full solution of equation ( [ pgg ] ) , rescaled according to ( [ scal1 ] ) .",
    "results are given for two ( small ) values of the capillary number differing by a factor of ten .",
    "again , the free parameter in the maximal film solution ( [ film ] ) is used to shoot for the flat interface corresponding to the surface of the fluid - filled container . for small values of @xmath65 ,",
    "the solution corresponds to the lubrication form given before , while on a scale @xmath66 the transition to the landau - levich region is observed",
    ". in rescaled coordinates @xmath65 the location of this crossover should thus be proportional to @xmath14 itself , as is clearly seen from figure 2 .",
    "we have chosen the smaller of the two values of @xmath14 such that the region over which the asymptotic form ( [ asymp ] ) of the interface can be applied is zero , to highlight possible problems in comparing asymptotic solutions with experimental data .",
    "to interpret the measured dynamical contact angle equation ( [ asymp ] ) is no longer sufficient , but the full solution of the similarity equation ( [ sim1 ] ) has to be considered .",
    "it is common practice in the literature ( e.g. de gennes 1985 , cox 1986 ) to consider the derivative of the profile @xmath22 , evaluate it at some macroscopic distance from the contact line @xmath67 , and to interpret the slope of the interface in terms of the so - called `` dynamical contact angle '' , @xmath68 .",
    "this approach is the common one taken in experiments as well .",
    "thus , using the solution ( [ asymp ] ) in the similarity forms ( [ scal1 ] ) and ( [ scal2 ] ) for models i and ii , respectively , and neglecting lower - order terms , we obtain @xmath69 where @xmath70 are microscopic lengths appropriate for each model .",
    "there are two fundamental issues with this approach : first , depending on the experimental system it is not clear what is the best choice for @xmath71 .",
    "second , what is usually taken as a fixed microscopic length @xmath70 is actually strongly dependent on the capillary number .",
    "namely , the two models give @xmath72as established in ( [ modelone - shape ] ) and ( [ modeltwo - shape ] ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , the @xmath14 dependence that appears in the microscopic length is different in the two models .",
    "it is also clear that it is impossible to interpret @xmath70 directly in terms of some fixed microscopic length near the contact line , but rather it is a _ dynamical _ quantity . to our knowledge , this fact has never been appreciated in either theoretical or experimental work .",
    "this observation appears to be significant , since by comparing the @xmath73-dependence it potentially allows one to distinguish between different microscopic models from a macroscopic measurement .",
    "chen and wada ( 1989 ) imaged the profile near the contact line of a spreading droplet and so provided the first experimental confirmation of ( [ dyn ] ) .",
    "however , owing to the small range of capillary numbers studied , it is difficult to distinguish between the two lengths @xmath70 defined in ( [ lmicr ] ) . below we will therefore concentrate on another experiment ( marsh , garoff & dussan 1993 ) , which allowed @xmath74 to be varied over more than two orders of magnitude",
    "it is also interesting to note that the logarithmic dependence on capillary number was only obtained in the fully nonlinear treatment outlined above . in the classical studies of the flow in the neighborhood of the dynamic contact angle , for example in cox ( 1986 ) ,",
    "a matched asymptotic analysis is used which further assumes a form involving integer powers of @xmath14 and does not recognize that the scale of the inner region can itself involve @xmath14 .",
    "however the form of the asymptotics ( [ dyn ] ) , implying a _ logarithmic _ dependence on @xmath14 in the full solution , clearly shows that the profile can not be expanded in integer powers of c. as a result , the classical analyses are not able to identify the sort of dependencies given by ( [ lmicr ] ) .",
    "although these dependencies are only logarithmic , as mentioned above , the capillary number often varies through many orders of magnitude in experiments , so the logarithm in ( [ dyn ] ) can in general not be approximated by a constant , as is most often done ( e.g. king 2001 ) .    in a recent experiment ,",
    "the effect of large variations of @xmath14 on the contact line was investigated very carefully by marsh et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who measured the dynamic contact angles on a cylinder plunging at an angle into a liquid bath .",
    "these authors essentially used the form ( [ dyn ] ) to fit the whole shape of the interface close to the contact line , and included _",
    "static _ contributions to account for the effects of surface tension and gravity away from the contact line .",
    "( note that instead of the third power on the left hand side , they actually used a more complicated function @xmath75 , but which becomes @xmath76 for small arguments .",
    "this limit is relevant for the small angle case we are studying here . )",
    "this approach leaves out dynamical effects of the kind predicted by landau and levich ( levich 1962 ) , which are important on an intermediate scale between the microscopic ones and the capillary length , and should be taken into account in a more refined theory .",
    "marsh et al .",
    "( 1993 ) treat the static contact angle @xmath77 ( called @xmath78 by the authors ) as a free , and possibly @xmath14-dependent , parameter , to be determined from experiment .",
    "the authors conclude that for their system @xmath5 , which is the case treated here .    from the fit of ( [ dyn ] ) to their data , marsh et al .",
    "( 1993 ) extract a length @xmath79 , which is found to depend significantly on capillary number , as suggested by ( [ lmicr ] ) !",
    "they also report @xmath79 to be independent of the tilt angle @xmath80 within experimental error , which further emphasizes that the response is dominated by local features . in figure [ mgd ] we present a plot of the measured length as function of capillary number , and",
    "compare it with the slopes suggested by the van der waals model i and the navier slip model ii , respectively . although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions owing to the large scatter in the data , 2/3 seems to be favored .",
    "using the two different fits plotted in figure [ mgd ] , we are also able to determine the cut - off lengths @xmath25 and @xmath29 , assuming that the corresponding physical mechanism is really relevant for the particular materials involved .",
    "we find @xmath81for the van der waals model and @xmath82for the slip model .",
    "using the value of @xmath83 ( russel , saville & schowalter 1989 ) for the hamaker constant for water and an adjacent solid surface , and @xmath84 , we find @xmath85 , consistent with the above value . however , it is important to keep in mind that there is no reason why _ a single _ cutoff mechanism should necessarily dominate in the experiment , which would lead to still other exponents .",
    "additional mechanisms for relieving the contact line singularity are listed in table [ t1 ] ; which is the dominant mechanism could also depend on capillary number and , in particular , on the type of solid substrate or fluid involved .",
    "we have considered flow local to a moving contact line using a lubrication approach .",
    "our basic message has been to indicate that the appearance of logarithmic corrections in capillary number to the usual `` tanner s law '' , @xmath86 , are a general feature of the mechanical response .",
    "the interpretation of the results is that the `` microscopic '' length scale that is involved when supplying a small - scale cut - off to relieve the well - known stress singularity in the moving contact line problem is a dynamical ( speed dependent ) quantity .",
    "experimental data consistent with this interpretation is cited , and microscopic parameters that come from the comparison with different theories agree with physical considerations .",
    "since important applications of contact line theories apply to angles up to @xmath87 , it would be very useful to extend the lubrication theory considered here to a full two - dimensional treatment of the flow in the corner region .",
    "we suspect that large parts of the calculation in cox ( 1986 ) , which erroneously assumes a regular expansion in @xmath73 , could be adapted to a proper similarity description .",
    "this means that the dynamical contact angle has the scaling form @xmath88 , where @xmath70 is one of the _ dynamical _ length scales defined by ( [ lmicr ] ) , with corresponding forms for the velocity field as well .",
    "such a theory might be able to explain more recent experiments ( chen , ram & garoff 1995 ) on moving contact lines performed at higher capillary numbers , yielding dynamical contact angles of up to @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore , the velocity of the contact line relative to the substrate is in general not _ perpendicular _ to the contact line , as highlighted in recent experiments of droplets running down an inclined plane ( podgorski , flesselles & limat 2001 ) . in this case",
    "the flow is truly three - dimensional , and it may no longer be sufficient to simply project the velocity onto the normal to the contact line ( blake & ruschak 1979 )",
    ". such a three - dimensional description would be necessary to complete our understanding of corner singularities that form at the back of running drops ( stone et al .",
    "2002 ) , and may apply to a range of other contact line phenomena as well .",
    "here we briefly recall the derivation of the interface , or lubrication , equations for thin viscous films ( levich ( 1962 ) ) . for pressure - driven flow along the surface and absorbing hydrostatic pressure variations into the pressure @xmath90 , the velocity parallel to the plate",
    "can be represented as a second - order polynomial @xmath91where @xmath92 is the distance normal to the plate . at the free surface @xmath93 , shear gradients",
    "@xmath94 vanish , giving @xmath95 .",
    "finally , from the slip condition ( [ navier ] ) we have @xmath96 .",
    "since the contact line is stationary , the mass flux through the film is zero everywhere , @xmath97 , and thus @xmath98 is the equation for the film profile @xmath22 . in the presence of van der waals forces",
    ", the dynamic pressure in the liquid is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is hamaker s constant . substituting ( [ lubrication - pressure ] ) into ( [ zero_flux ] ) and assuming @xmath101 gives ( [ pgg ] ) , while @xmath102 at finite @xmath29 leads to ( [ hocking ] ) .",
    "here we give some more details on the solution of ( [ lub1 ] ) for the `` maximal film '' of hervet and de gennes ( 1984 ) .",
    "the general form of the film profile is @xmath103 where we denote the similarity variable by @xmath53 .",
    "this expansion has _ no _ free parameters , as the values of the coefficients @xmath104 are obtained directly from substituting ( [ phi_0 ] ) into ( [ lub1 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath105    however , there is a one - parameter family of solutions of ( [ lub1 ] ) that decay for @xmath106 .",
    "this solution is found by linearizing around the base solution ( [ phi_0 ] ) , i.e. @xmath107 : @xmath108 equation ( [ lin ] ) is solved using a wkb - type ansatz , @xmath109    the @xmath110 contribution in the exponent turns out to be a logarithm , so the full structure is @xmath111 and the coefficients are found to be @xmath112 thus the general form of the solution in the film region is @xmath113 with a single free parameter @xmath47 .",
    "an alternative description would be an expansion of the form @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 a free parameter .",
