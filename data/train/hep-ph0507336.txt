    "hadronic observables are functions of these parameters , and one physically sensible is the dependence on the quark masses , which allows to get insight on the limit of heavy quarks . in particular , this limit is reflected in the weak decay constant of pseudoscalar heavy - light mesons , which in potential models were found to be @xmath2  @xcite ( @xmath3 is the heavy quark mass ) .",
