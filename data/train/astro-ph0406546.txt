    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have proven that they are unequivocally suited as precise distance indicators , ideal for probing the vast distances necessary to measure the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the results of the high-@xmath0 supernova search team  @xcite and the supernova cosmology project  @xcite have astonishingly shown that the universe is not decelerating ( and therefore not matter dominated ) , but is apparently accelerating , driven apart by a dominant negative pressure , or `` dark energy .",
    "'' complementary results from the cosmic microwave background by wmap  @xcite and large - scale structure from 2df  @xcite congruously show evidence for a low matter density ( @xmath6 ) and a non - zero cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) , but neither directly require the presence of dark energy .    however , it is possible that there are astrophysical effects which allow sne  ia to appear systematically fainter with distance and therefore mimic the most convincing evidence for the existence of dark energy .",
    "a pervasive screen of `` gray dust '' scattered within the intergalactic medium could make sne  ia seem dim , but show little corresponding reddening  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the progenitor systems of sne  ia could be changing with time , resulting in evolving populations of events , and possibly necessitating modifications to the empirical correlations which are currently used to make sne  ia precise standard candles . to date , the investigations of either effect have only provided contrary evidence , disfavoring popular intergalactic dust models  @xcite , and statistically showing strong similarity in sn  ia characteristics at all age epochs , locally and at @xmath8  @xcite , but neither has been conclusively ruled out",
    ".    a simple test of the high - redshift survey results would be to search for sne  ia at even higher redshifts , beyond @xmath9 . in the range @xmath10 , we should observe sne  ia exploding in an epoch of cosmic deceleration , thus becoming relatively brighter than at lower redshifts .",
    "this is expected to be unmistakably distinguishable from simple astrophysical challenges to the sn  ia conclusion .",
    "indeed , results from 19 sne  ia observed in the range @xmath11 from the latest high-@xmath0 supernova survey  @xcite and in the ifa survey  @xcite show indications of past deceleration , but these sne represent the highest - redshift bin attainable from the ground , in which confident identification and light - curve parameters are pushed to their limits . to thoroughly and reliably survey sne  ia at @xmath10 , and to perform the follow - up observations necessary for such a study , requires observing deeper than can be feasibly done with the ground - based telescopes .",
    "however , with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , a higher-@xmath0 sn survey is practical . through careful planning , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) has been designed to accommodate a deep survey for sne with a specific emphasis on the discovery and follow - up of @xmath12 sne  ia .",
    "we discovered 42 sne over the 8-month duration of the survey .",
    "we also measured redshifts , both spectroscopic and photometric , for all but one of the sn host galaxies .",
    "for the first time , we have a significant sample of sne  ia spanning a large range in redshift , from a complete survey with well understood systematics and limitations .",
    "certainly this has allowed for precise measurement of the sn rates and the rate evolution with redshift  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it also allows for a comparison of the observed sn  ia rate history to the star - formation rate history , and thus an analysis of sn  ia assembly time , or `` delay time , '' relative to a single burst of star formation . by exploring the range and distribution of the time from progenitor formation to sn  ia explosion that is required by the data",
    ", we can provide clues to the nature of the mechanism ( or mechanisms ) which produce sne  ia .",
    "we describe the hubble higher-@xmath0 supernova search ( hhzss ) project in   [ sec : goods ] , along with image processing and reduction , transient detection , and sn identification methods . in   [ sec : results ] we show the results of the survey , including discovery information on all sne , and multi - epoch , multi - band photometry of sne over the search epochs of the survey . in   [ sec : dt ] we report on observational constraints on the inherent sn frequency distribution , or the distribution `` delay times '' for sn  ia progenitors , and discuss the implied constraints on the model sn  ia progenitor systems .",
    "elsewhere , we report on the rates of sne  ia and core - collapse sne , the comparison of these measured rates to those made by other surveys , and to the predicted sn formation - rate history partly predicted from the analysis in this paper  @xcite . in another paper we report on the constraints of cosmological parameters and the nature of high-@xmath0 sne  ia  @xcite",
    "goods was designed to combine extremely deep multi - wavelength observations to trace the galaxy formation history and the nature and distribution of light from star formation and active nuclei  @xcite . using _",
    "hst_/acs , it has probed the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical portion of high - redshift galaxies through observations in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 bandpasses , with a goal of achieving extended source sensitivities only 0.50.8 mag shallower than the original hubble deep field observations  @xcite .",
    "images were obtained in 15 overlapping `` tiled '' pointings , covering a total effective area of @xmath17 square arcmin per field .",
    "two fields with high ecliptic latitude were observed , the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) and the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) , to provide complementary data from missions in other wavelengths ( _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , _ xmm - newton _ , _ spitzer _ space telescope ) and to allow ground - based observations from both hemispheres ( see figures  [ fig : fieldhdfn ] and [ fig : fieldcdfs ] ) .",
    "the goods observations in the @xmath16 band were scheduled over 5 epochs separated by @xmath18 days to accommodate a `` piggybacking '' transient survey .",
    "this baseline is ideal for selecting sne  ia near peak at @xmath9 , and sne  ia on the rise at @xmath19 , as the risetime ( from explosion to maximum brightness ) for sne  ia is @xmath20 days in the rest frame  @xcite .",
    "the baseline also insures that no sn in the desired redshift range will have sufficient time to rise within our detection threshold , and then fall beyond detection before the field is revisited , maximizing the overall yield .    intentionally , the goods filter selections were nearly ideal for the detection , identification , and analysis of high - redshift sne  ia . for a sn  ia at @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath16 band covers nearly the same part of the sed as the rest - frame @xmath22 band .",
    "the k - correction , or the correction of the observed flux to some rest - frame bandpass ( e.g. , @xmath16 to @xmath22 ) , is thus relatively small .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the survey , assuming detection limits based on the @xmath23  s exposure times per epoch ( using the acs exposure time calculator ) and the desired baseline between epochs , implied that the distribution of sne  ia would be centered at @xmath9 , with @xmath24 to @xmath25 of the events occurring in the @xmath10 range . scaling from other lower-@xmath0 sn survey yields , it was expected that a total of 3050 sne of all types would be discovered , and that @xmath26 of them would be sne  ia .",
    "these numbers implied that we could expect to find @xmath27 to 8 sne  ia in the range of @xmath28 , which could be sufficient for an initial investigation of cosmology in the deceleration epoch .",
    "the success of this survey has been due , in large part , to the rapid processing and delivery of data , and the rapid post - processing by a reliable pipeline .",
    "the exposures constituting a single tile in a single passband arrived from _ hst _ within 6 to 18 hours after observation ( with an average of @xmath29 hours ) , and fully processed ( differenced with previous epochs ) within a few hours after arrival . in general , the complete multi - wavelength data for a single tile were fully searched for candidate sne within a day after observation .",
    "the individual exposures of a tile in a given epoch were reduced ( bias - subtracted and flat - field corrected ) through the calacs standard acs calibration pipeline .",
    "the well - dithered subexposures ( or cr splits ; see below ) were then corrected for geometric distortions and combined using the multidrizzle pipeline  @xcite . for the survey , we maintained the physical pixel size of @xmath30 pixel@xmath31 for the discovery of transients .",
    "a key feature of this pipeline is its identification and removal of cosmic rays ( crs ) and hot pixels .",
    "each 2100  s exposure in @xmath16 consisted of 4 individual 520  s cr splits , each dithered by small offsets . in each of the cr",
    "splits , the cr contamination , at the time of the survey , was as high as @xmath32 of all pixels , and hot pixels accounted for an additional @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "with such a high incidence of crs and hot pixels , averaging ( or taking the median ) over the few cr splits would not adequately remove these potential confusion sources .",
    "instead , we used the minmed algorithm described in  @xcite . basically , of the pixels in each cr split covering the same area of sky , the highest - value pixel was rejected .",
    "the median of the remaining three pixels was then compared to the minimum - value pixel .",
    "if the minimum pixel was within 6@xmath34 of the median , then the median value was kept , otherwise the minimum value was used . a second pass",
    "was performed , repeating the minmed rejection on pixels neighboring those which had been previously replaced with minimum values ( indicating cr or hotpixel impact ) , but at a lower threshold to remove `` halos '' around bright crs .",
    "the result was that each pixel of the output combined image was either the median or the minimum of the input values .",
    "admittedly , the combined result was less sensitive than can be obtained in a straight median , but the multidrizzle algorithm ( with minmed ) did successfully reject @xmath35 of crs and hot pixels after combination .",
    "the search was conducted in 8 campaigns ( 4 campaigns for each of the hdfn and the cdfs surveys ) by differencing images from contiguous epochs . for a given tile in a field ,",
    "images covering the same area from the previous epoch were aligned ( registered ) using the sources in the tiles .",
    "catalogs of the pixel centroids and instrumental magnitudes of sources on each image were made using sextractor  @xcite and fed into a triangle matching routine ( starmatch , courtesy of b. schmidt ) which determined the linear registration transformation from one epoch to the next .",
    "the typical precision of the registrations was 0.20.3 pixels root - mean square ( rms ) , and the point - spread function ( psf ) in each epoch of observation remained nominally at 0.10@xmath36 fwhm .",
    "the combination of precise registration and nearly constant psf allowed for images to be subtracted directly , without the need for image convolution .",
    "several examples of the image subtraction quality are shown in figures  [ fig : imsub1 ] ,  [ fig : imsub2 ] ,  and [ fig : imsub3 ] . in ideal situations ,",
    "only transient sources remain in the residual image on a nearly zero - level background . however , in practice there were many situations which produced non - transient residuals .",
    "although extensive care was taken to remove many crs and hot pixels in the image processing , these artifacts did occasionally slip past the rejection algorithms , specifically when multiple effects were coincident on the same area of sky .",
    "for example , for a given pixel in each of the four cr splits covering the same area of sky , the probability that the pixels were impacted by a cr in 3 of the 4 exposures is approximately 1 in @xmath37 .",
    "roughly 20 pixels in the combined 20 million pixel array would show cr residuals after passing through the multidrizzle algorithm .",
    "in addition ,  breathing \" in the optical path , focus drift , and the slight change in the pixel scale across the image plane have all led to small yet detectable variations in the psf . sometimes bright compact objects were over - subtracted in the wings of their radial profiles and under - subtracted in the inner 12 pixels . other instrumental sources of confusion include diffraction spikes , correlated noise from multiple image resampling , and slight registration errors due to the lack of sources over a large registration area .    the non - trivial abundance of false positives required rigorous residual inspection methods . we therefore searched the subtracted images redundantly to minimize false detection biases and to maximize recovery of elusive , faint transients .",
    "an automated routine was performed to identify psf - like residuals which were well separated ( @xmath38 pixels ) from known saturated pixels , and above @xmath39 of the sky background .",
    "the inherent nature of this routine prohibits the detection of nonstellar residuals , faint residuals , residuals near bright stars or nuclei ( which may be saturated ) , or residuals in areas where the rms of the background could not be easily determined by the automated routine . therefore , so that no potential sne were lost , several human searchers visually inspected each subtracted image .",
    "at least two pairs of searchers _ independently _ scoured a few residual tiles .",
    "visual searching of only a few tiles insured that it was done thoroughly , and helped to alleviate monotony and fatigue .",
    "candidate sne found by the software and the searchers were then scrutinized based on the following set of criteria to select sne and further reject instrumental ( and astronomical ) false positives :    _ ( 1 ) misregistration : _ areas with @xmath40 detectable sources per arcmin@xmath41 are typically poorly registered ( @xmath42 pixel rms ) .",
    "sources in these areas of the subtracted images are under - subtracted on one side , and over - subtracted on the other . if the total flux in an aperture encompassing the source was not significantly greater than a few times the background rms , it was assumed that the residual was an artifact of misregistration .    _ ( 2 ) cosmic ray residuals : _ the number of pixels in @xmath23  s combined images that still contain crs due to impacts on the same regions of sky on one or more individual @xmath43  s exposures is roughly @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of impacted exposures ( out of 4 ) .",
    "this number can grow slightly when considering hot pixels and bright pixels with crs . to further reject these artifacts",
    ", we required that candidates have no more than one constituent exposure affected by crs or hot pixels .",
    "_ ( 3 ) stellar profile : _ residuals in the subtracted images were required to show a radial profile consistent with the psf ( @xmath46 pixels fwhm ) .",
    "narrower profiles were considered to be stacked noise ( if not residual crs ) and wider profiles were typically poor subtractions from misregistrations , breathing , or focus drift .    _",
    "( 4 ) multiple epochs of detection : _ it was required that each candidate be detected ( to within 5@xmath34 ) on each of the cr split exposures that were not impacted by crs or hot pixels at the relevant location .",
    "additional weight was given to candidates that were clearly detected in the @xmath15 band , or additionally in the @xmath14 band .",
    "however , this was not a strict criterion as it was expected that sne  ia at higher redshifts would become less detectable in the bluer wavelengths ( see section  [ sec : snid ] ) .    _",
    "( 5 ) variable galactic nuclei : _ sources that were @xmath47 pixel from their host nuclei were considered potential active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and typically not included in the target of opportunity follow - up program ( see  [ sec : follow ] ) .",
    "however , these residuals were followed over subsequent search epochs , and in all but one case , sufficient photometric evidence ( see  [ sec : snid ] ) was found to classify them as sne .",
    "bright residuals that were coincident with the nuclei of galaxies were also compared with known x - ray sources from the chandra deep field south and chandra deep field north 1 megasecond catalogs  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "the only variable source unidentified by spectroscopic or photometric means was identified as known x - ray source , and therefore rejected as the only confirmed optically variable agn in the survey .    _",
    "( 6 ) solar - system objects and slow - moving stars : _ we required that our candidates show no proper motion .",
    "assuming we were sensitive to 1/2-pixel shifts , the proper motion of any candidate could not be more than @xmath48 over the @xmath23  s combined exposure , or @xmath49 hr@xmath31 ( 0.1 deg yr@xmath31 ) .",
    "hypothetically , if a source was bound to the sun ( with tangential velocity @xmath50 km hr@xmath31 ) , then its distance would have to be @xmath51 [ ( 30 km s@xmath31)/(0.043  hr@xmath31 ) ] , or greater than @xmath52 au .",
    "in addition , if the object was illuminated by reflected sunlight , then its apparent magnitude ( @xmath53 ) would be related to its angular diameter ( @xmath54 ) by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the apparent magnitude of the sun .",
    "since @xmath54 must be consistent with the psf ( @xmath57 ) , the source would have to be @xmath58 times larger than jupiter ( at the distance assumed from the limits on proper motion ) , and the apparent magnitude of the source would have to be @xmath59 mag ! alternatively , using the limiting magnitude for the survey , @xmath60 ( see   [ sec : controltime ] ) , the source would have to have an angular size of @xmath61 in order to have been lit by the sun at its assumed distance .",
    "a similar argument can be made for slow - moving stars .",
    "since @xmath62 hr@xmath31 is the fastest a source could move without being detected , in the @xmath2 days since the field was last observed the source could have moved @xmath63 pixels .",
    "our survey was clearly sensitive to negative residuals as well as positive ones ( a fact indicated by the frequent discovery of sne declining in brightness since the previous epoch ) .",
    "we saw no negative candidates which were detected within 1000 pixels of a positive source on the same epoch of observation .",
    "most of these sne have been observed on more than one epoch , and all but two were detected within @xmath64 of a galaxy ( presumably the host ) .",
    "it would be highly unlikely for any of these to be objects moving within the solar system or the galaxy .",
    "sne are generally classified by the presence or absence of particular features in their optical spectra ( see @xcite  @xcite for a review ) . historically , the primary division in type has been by the absence ( sne  i ) or presence ( sne  ii ) of hydrogen in their spectra , but the classification currently extends to at least 7 distinct subtypes ( sn iil , iip , iin , iib , ia , ib , and ic ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the explosion mechanism is a more physical basis by which to separate sne .",
    "sne  ia probably arise from the thermonuclear explosion of carbon - oxygen white dwarf stars , while all other types of sne are produced by the core collapse of massive stars ( @xmath65 ) .    there can be considerable challenges in the ground - based spectroscopic identification of high - redshift sne .",
    "as the principal goal of this survey has been to acquire many sne  ia at @xmath66 , a fundamental prerequisite was that we could make confident identifications of at least this sn type .",
    "much to our benefit , _ hst _ with the acs @xmath67 grism provides superb spectra with significantly higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) than can currently be achieved from the ground .",
    "its limitation is the low spectral resolution ( @xmath68 per pixel , in first order ) and the overlap of multiple spectral orders from other nearby sources .",
    "spectral resolution of @xmath69 km s@xmath31 is not problematic for sne with ejecta velocities of @xmath70 km s@xmath31 .",
    "however , because of the spectral - order confusion and the lack of a slit mask , the @xmath67 grism could only be used for sne with substantial angular separation from their hosts and from other nearby sources .",
    "it was expected that sn candidates would generally be either too faint to be spectroscopically observed from the ground , or too close to their host galaxies or other nearby sources to be identified with the acs grism .",
    "we therefore had to rely on some secondary method by which to identify sne , specifically to select likely sne  ia from the sample .",
    "the inherent differences in the ejecta compositions of sne  ia and sne  ii leads to an observable difference in their intrinsic early - time uv flux . as optical observations shift to the rest - frame uv for @xmath71 sne , the `` uv deficit '' in sne  ia can be a useful tool for discriminating sne  ia from sne  ii , the most common types of core - collapse ( cc ) sne . using a method pioneered by  @xcite and fully developed in  @xcite , we use the @xmath16 apparent magnitude , the @xmath72 and @xmath73 colors , the measured redshift or photometric redshift estimates ( see below ) , and age constraints provided by the baseline between search epochs to grossly identify sne as either sne  ia or sne  cc .",
    "this method is only useful for @xmath12 sne near maximum light , and is not foolproof in its identification .",
    "there are sne  cc ( e.g. , luminous sne  ib and ic ) which can occupy nearly the same magnitude - color space as sne  ia .",
    "however , these bright sn  ib / c make up only @xmath20% of all sne  ib / c , which as a group are only @xmath24 as plentiful as other sne  cc  @xcite .    from the ground , we have obtained spectroscopic identification of 6 sne  ia and 1 sn  cc in the redshift range 0.21.1 using keck + lris ( see table  [ tab : sntable ] ) . with _",
    "hst_/acs and the @xmath67 grism , we have obtained excellent spectra of 6 sne  ia at @xmath741.4 , the most distant sample of spectroscopically confirmed sne ; see  @xcite .",
    "these spectra cover only the 25005000    range in the rest frame , but they are of excellent s / n , unattainable for such high-@xmath0 sne from the ground .",
    "these identifications also serve as an excellent proof of concept in the color - magnitude selection .    using keck , the vlt , and the acs grism , we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 29 of the 42 sne in our sample . to our benefit , part of the goods endeavor involved obtaining extensive multi - wavelength photometry spanning the @xmath75 to the near - ir passbands to estimate the photometric redshifts (  phot-@xmath0 \" ) of galaxies in the hdfn and cdfs fields  @xcite .",
    "the precision of the phot-@xmath0 from goods with respect to known spectroscopic redshifts has been within @xmath76 rms , with the occasional instance ( @xmath77 of a tested sample ) where the phot-@xmath0 method misestimates the actual redshift by more than 20% . in order to improve on the accuracy of the phot-@xmath0 measurements for the host galaxies , we remeasured the multi - wavelength photometry by visually determining the centroid of the host galaxies , and manually determining an annulus in which the sky background is determined .",
    "this allowed better photometric precision than was generally achieved in the _ sextractor_-based automated cataloging . comparing the sample of 26 sn host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts to the phot-@xmath0 estimates from the improved photometry resulted in a precision of 0.05 rms ( after rejecting two @xmath78 outliers ) , and",
    "only @xmath79 of the sample was misestimated by more than 10% ( see figure  [ fig : photz ] ) .",
    "the redshifts of the remainder of the sn hosts ( without spectroscopic redshifts ) were determined in this way , with the exception of sn  2002fv , whose host was not identified due to the magnitude limits of the survey .",
    "we fit template light curves to grossly identify sne which were not spectroscopically identified , and were not at @xmath12 nor constrained near maximum light . using the light curves of sne  1994d , 1999em , 1998s , and 1994i as models for sne  ia , iip , iil , and ib / c ( respectively ) ,",
    "we transformed these model sne to the redshifts of the observed sne , correcting for the effects of time dilation , and applying k - corrections to the rest - frame bandpasses to produce light curves as they would have been seen through the @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 bandpasses at the desired redshifts .",
    "the k - corrections were determined from model spectra  @xcite for sne  ia , and from color - age light - curve interpolations for sne  cc .",
    "we have also made use of the web tool provided by  @xcite to check the derived colors for the sne  cc .",
    "we visually determined the best - fit model light curve to the observed light curves , allowing shifting along the time axis , magnitude offsets , and extinction / reddening ( assuming the galactic extinction law ) along the magnitude axis .",
    "best fits required consistency in the light - curve shape and peak color ( to within magnitude limits ) and in peak luminosity in that the derived absolute magnitude in the rest - frame @xmath22 band had to be consistent with the observed distribution of absolute @xmath22-band magnitudes shown in  @xcite .",
    "each discovered sn was given an identity rank ( gold , silver , or bronze ) reflecting our confidence in the identification .",
    "a gold rank indicated the highest confidence that the sn was the stated type , and it was not likely that the sn could have been some other sn type .",
    "a silver rank indicated the identity was quite confident , but the sn lacked sufficient corroborating evidence to be considered gold .",
    "a bronze rank indicated that there was evidence the sn type was correct , but there was a significant possibility that the sn type was incorrect .",
    "we were clearly confident of the sn type in cases where a high s / n ( @xmath80 ) spectrum conclusively revealed its type ; these sne were gold , by definition .",
    "however , the majority of sne were without sufficient spectra to unambiguously determine a type .",
    "we then used additional information on the sn redshift , photometric data , and host - galaxy morphology , seeking a consistent picture for a specific sn type .",
    "we first considered the possibility that a candidate was a sn  ia .",
    "we required that the light - curve shape was at least consistent with a sn  ia at its redshift , and that the observed colors and derived absolute magnitude could be made consistent with the template light - curve colors with @xmath81 mag of extinction ( assuming the galactic extinction law ) .",
    "if the sn was at @xmath12 , and its peak colors were @xmath82 mag and @xmath83 mag , we considered it highly likely to be a sn  ia .",
    "the study of  @xcite has shown that at low redshifts , early - type galaxies ( ellipticals ) only produce sne  ia , and have not as yet been shown to produce sne  cc .",
    "hence , we regard sne found in red elliptical hosts to have been most likely sne  ia and unlikely sne  cc .    based on the above information , any sn in our survey at @xmath66 , in a red elliptical host , and having light curves and peak colors consistent with a sn  ia , were most confidently considered sne  ia and ranked  gold sne  ia . \" sne having photometric data consistent with sne  ia , and either at @xmath66 ( identifiable by their peak color ) or in early - type host galaxies , were considered sne  ia with a high confidence , and therefore ranked  silver sne  ia . \"",
    "sne having light curves consistent with sne  ia , but without any other information to confirm their type , were ranked as  bronze sne  ia . \"    if the light curves for a sn seemed inconsistent with a sn  ia , we compared them to the model light curves for sne  cc . if the sn showed a slow rate of decline from peak ( consistent with sne  iip and some sne  iin ) , then it was considered a sn  cc with high confidence , or a  silver sn  cc . \"",
    "all other sne , inconsistent with sne  ia , sne  iip , or slowly declining sne  iin , were placed into the  bronze sn  cc \" category . for clarity , we include a flow chart showing the conditions used to determine the identification confidence rank ( figure  [ fig : flow ] ) .      an intensive target of opportunity ( too ) follow - up program with _ hst _ ( go 9352 ; riess , pi ) was conducted for candidate sne  ia in the range of @xmath84 . the decision to trigger the",
    "too was based on the prior certainty of sn  ia type and redshift range .",
    "these observations are intended to support multi - wavelength light - curve shape fitting  @xcite with multiple observations in passbands as close to the rest - frame @xmath75 , @xmath22 , and @xmath85 bands as possible .",
    "the too program consisted of supplementary observations with acs ( in @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands ) , nicmos ( in the @xmath86 and @xmath87 bands ) , and acs @xmath67 grism spectra when feasible .",
    "these observations were rapidly initiated ( within @xmath88 week of sn detection ) so that identification and color measurements could be made as near to maximum light as possible , and so that the light - curve sampling could be optimized . using an updated version of the multicolor light - curve shape algorithm ( jha , riess , & kirshner 2004 , in preparation ) , we estimate key parameters of the rest - frame optical light curves , particularly the @xmath22-band magnitude at maximum , the rest - frame @xmath89 and @xmath90 colors at maximum , and the rate of decline from maximum light in the @xmath22 band .",
    "further details on the too program , including the photometric and spectroscopic data , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "over the course of 8 search campaigns from 2002 august to 2003 may , we successfully discovered 42 sne of both physical types over a wide range of redshifts .",

    ", this flux can not be included in the total of galaxy light surveyed .",
    "as the sn rate is expected to follow the galaxy light , the rejected flux would result in a loss in the overall number of sne discovered , which we represent as a reduction in efficiency .",
    "for example , a galaxy core which produced a 22 mag residual would be unsearchable for sne @xmath186 mag .",
    "therefore , the efficiency for sne @xmath186 mag would drop by a fraction proportional to the fraction of all galaxy light that is contained in the cores of galaxies which could produce 22 mag residuals .",
    "fainter galaxy residuals only reduce the efficiency for fainter sne .",
    "these faint galaxy residuals are more numerous , but the flux within the cores of the galaxies which produced them is a considerably smaller fraction of the total flux in the image , and therefore their rejection would result in only a small contribution to the efficiency loss .",
    "we find that only 8% of the total light in an image was contained in the cores of galaxies , nearly half of which resided in bright galaxies .",
    "the galaxies which produced residuals @xmath187 mag accounted for approximately @xmath188 of the flux in the image , and therefore an overall 4% efficiency reduction for all sne .",
    "increasingly fainter galaxies further reduced the efficiency for fainter sne , leading to a 6% efficiency drop by @xmath189 , and a 8% reduction by @xmath190 .",

    "this will provide important clues to the distribution of channels for sn  ia production .",
    "the @xmath256 $ ] as a function of @xmath246 is shown in figure  [ fig : prob ] for the different @xmath125 and sfr@xmath124 models .",
    "the maximum likelihood @xmath246 values are listed in table  [ tab : stats ] for each tested model .",
    "the 95% confidence intervals for each model are also tabulated in table  [ tab : stats ] .",
    "although the bayesian likelihood test gives the most likely values of @xmath246 within a given model , and to some extent , which models are preferred by the data ( as the number of free parameters per model are the same ) , it does not give a very good estimation of which models are inconsistent with the data , and therefore can be rejected at some confidence interval .",
    "we attempt to assess how improbable it would be to derive the observed sample from a given model by a monte carlo simulation . for each model ,",
    "an artificial sample of 25 redshifts were drawn from the model distribution 10,000 times , and the likelihood of the test distribution was determined for each run .",
    "we then recorded the success fraction , or the fraction of runs which produced likelihood values less than or equal to the likelihood determined from the observed redshift distribution for the given model .",
    "models which produced redshift distributions similar to the observed distribution less than @xmath257 of the time were considered improbable models for the data .",
    "the success fractions as a function of @xmath246 for the different @xmath125 and sfr@xmath124 models are shown in figure  [ fig : success ] .    in general , we find that the @xmath257 success fraction interval in @xmath246 was consistent with the 95% confidence intervals determined from the bayesian likelihood test for each model . however , the selection of the acceptable range in success fraction is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "more stringent cuts which seek to either isolate only those models which well reproduce the data , or those which can not reproduce them at all , will constrict or expand the acceptable range accordingly .",
    "we therefore chose to adopt the 95% interval as our acceptable range in @xmath246 for a given delay time and sfr(@xmath0 ) model , acknowledging that there may be models in slightly different ranges which could be considered acceptable depending on the selected tolerance level .",
    "the @xmath235-folding model showed a preference for large values of @xmath246 , with the likelihood of @xmath246 increasing with the value of @xmath246 .",
    "as the probability distribution remained unbounded at @xmath258 gyr ( the limit of our testing region ) , we chose to consider the 95% confidence region for @xmath259 gyr .",
    "this rejected @xmath260 and @xmath261 gyr to @xmath5 confidence for m1 and m2 , respectively .",
    "the trend with increasing @xmath246 can be better exemplified by comparing the @xmath262 models to the observed @xmath262 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bigplot ] the predicted number distribution function of each model for selected values of @xmath246 is compared to the observed @xmath262 , arbitrarily binned with @xmath263 . for values of @xmath264",
    ", the @xmath235-folding models require that nearly all sne  ia explode within @xmath46 gyr of progenitor star formation .",
    "these `` prompt '' sne  ia result in an overestimate of the number of sne  ia at @xmath265 , and do not allow for sufficient development of sne  ia at lower redshifts .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath246 increases the fraction of sne  ia with delay times over 2 gyr , and therefore produces higher numbers of lower-@xmath0 sne .",
    "this alleviates a lot of the skewness in the distribution .",
    "however the fraction of prompt sne  ia is never less than 10% of all sne with delay times below 10 gyrs , thus the predicted number of sne  ia at @xmath266 will always be overestimated for this model .",
    "the overall result for large @xmath246 was a distribution which was too wide , overestimating the observed distribution at high and low redshift , and underestimating the vertex of the distribution .",
    "we find that this trend existed regardless which sfr model is used .",
    "an expected behavior of the @xmath235-folding model is that , at some value of @xmath246 , short delay times like @xmath267 gyr become as probable as delay times as long as the age of the universe .",
    "the supernova rate then becomes a reflection of the cumulative sfr(@xmath0 ) , and changes little with an increase in @xmath246 .",
    "this saturation appears to have been reached for @xmath268 gyr and @xmath269 gyr for the m1 and m2 sfr models , respectively .",
    "therefore , the maximum likelihood values for @xmath246 in the @xmath235-folding model shown in table  [ tab : stats ] are likely a circumstance of the noise in the saturated region . within our range of modeling , we find that there were only weak maximum likelihood values for @xmath246 in the @xmath235-folding model using either tested sfr model , and none adequately reproduced the observed frequency distribution with redshift .",
    "the sd progenitor models of @xcite suggest that a significant wind emanating from the accreting wd is required to allow a steady accretion onto the wd , and to extend the range of companion - star masses .",
    "however , in order for this wind to be adequate , the average galactic metallicity of the universe must reach [ fe / h ] @xmath270 . in this original analysis",
    ", @xcite predict this metallicity requirement imposes a redshift cutoff , beyond which the universe stops producing sne  ia , at @xmath271 .",
    "it is unlikely that this metallicity cutoff could exist at such a low redshift , as detections of sn  1997ff at @xmath272 and sn  2003ak at @xmath273 ( from this survey ) would be an obvious contradiction .",
    "however , in @xcite a refinement was made to allow the distribution of sne  ia to continue to @xmath274 , then rapidly decrease in spiral galaxies , followed by a rapid decrease in elliptical galaxies at @xmath275 . in this model ,",
    "sne  ia would not be produced at all beyond @xmath276 . to account for the possibility of a metallicity cutoff ( mco )",
    ", we executed another test involving the @xmath235-folding model where in which the cutoff function as described by  @xcite is applied to the sfr@xmath124 .",
    "the outcome was very similar to the results for the @xmath235-folding model without the mco , with 95% confidence intervals of @xmath277 and @xmath278 gyr for m1 and m2 , respectively .",
    "this is not surprising , considering that the applied mco would not have a great impact until @xmath275 , and the survey was only sensitive to sne  ia at @xmath279 .",
    "the gaussian models did , however , show a clear peak in the likelihood functions , indicating a value of @xmath246 which , for the model , is preferred by the data . for the wide gaussian model , the tests show a maximum likelihood at @xmath280 gyr for m1 ( 3.2 gyr for m2 ) . again , as the probability distribution was unbounded at @xmath258 , we consider @xmath281 and @xmath282 to be rejected with 95% confidence .",
    "although there appeared to be a statistically preferred value for @xmath246 for the wide gaussian model , the predicted distribution shown in figure  [ fig : bigplot ] in the range of the best - fit model was still wide , more skewed toward lower redshifts than the observed distribution , and seemingly underestimated the number observed in the @xmath283 range .",
    "however , this predicted redshift distribution was much better than the best - fits obtained in the @xmath235-folding test , which was reflected in the factor of @xmath284 increase in bayesian likelihood value .",
    "in contrast to the previously tested models , the width in the range of @xmath132 for the narrow gaussian model grew weakly with increasing @xmath246 , allowing for tests of models without a significant fraction of prompt sne  ia and a much more narrow distribution .",
    "the results of our test show a bayesian maximum likelihood value at @xmath285 for m1 ( 3.2 for m2 ) which was more than twice as likely as the best - fit model from the wide gaussian model , and more than four times more likely than the best - fit @xmath286folding model . the probability distribution for this model",
    "was well bounded by @xmath258 , indicating that the model was unsupported by the data for large values of @xmath246 .",
    "we therefore defined the 95% confidence interval centered on the maximum likelihood value , with @xmath287 for m1 , and @xmath288 for m2 .",
    "visually , the predicted @xmath262 for the narrow gaussian show a much more convincing match to the observed distributions at the maximum likelihood value than was produced from either of the other tested models , as can be seen in the panel labeled `` best fit '' in figure  [ fig : bigplot ] .",
    "it appears that the mean ( or characteristic ) delay time for sne  ia can be well constrained and , at least for the narrow gaussian model , a convincing number distribution with redshift can be drawn .",
    "our tests have shown a strong preference by the observed frequency distribution for delay time distributions in which the majority of sne  ia occur more than 2 gyr from the formation of the progenitor star .",
    "all @xmath251 models which implied that most sne  ia explode within @xmath46 gyr of progenitor formation show very low likelihoods and are rejected at the 95% confidence level .",
    "therefore , sne  ia can not generally be prompt events , nor can they be expected to closely follow the star formation rate history .",
    "tests conducted by  @xcite similarly conclude that the characteristic delay times of sne  ia should be large ( @xmath289 gyr ) for sfr(@xmath0 ) models similar to those used in this paper . however , there are a few important differences in these analyses . in  @xcite",
    "we show from the data presented in this paper that there is a peak in the sn  ia rate at @xmath290 .",
    "the data used in  @xcite study , based on observations from the supernova cosmology project  @xcite , do not extend beyond this observed peak , and are limited to @xmath291 .",
    "moreover , the nature of the @xmath235-folding @xmath251 used in  @xcite is similar to the @xmath235-fold model used in this paper , except that it accounts for the relatively short main sequence lifetime of the progenitor wd .",
    "therefore , a similar trend is expected in which increasing @xmath246 generally flattens the expected sn redshift distribution . due to the limited number and range in the observed sn  ia redshift distribution , the  @xcite analysis was only moderately sensitive to the slope of the increase in the sn rate .",
    "the data presented herein not only covers a much larger range in redshift , but they also appear to be unbounded by the volume surveyed at low redshift and the survey efficiency at high redshift ; the combination of which would overestimate the observed number by a factor of @xmath46 ( assuming the sn rate remains constant with time ) .",
    "it is certainly apparent that the observed sample is bounded by something more intrinsic to the sn  ia rate history , which we interpret as the star formation history convolved with the sn delay time distribution .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is unique because it probes delay time models which allow for a larger variation in the breadth of the redshift distributions without imposing generally unsupported sfr histories .",
    "our @xmath235-folding model , comparable to those previously tested in similar analyses , can not adequately reproduce the observed redshift distribution of sne  ia from this survey for @xmath292 gyr",
    ". this would also be true for the delay time distribution function inferred from the  @xcite sd model .",
    "we find that @xmath246 must be @xmath293 gyr for the @xmath286foliding model at a 95% confidence .",
    "we also find that the @xmath286folding model itself becomes untestable at @xmath294 gyrs as predicted redshift distributions are virtually indistinguishable above this limit . applying a redshift cuttoff due to metallicity effects based on the @xcite sd model only weakly affected the predicted distributions , and produced similar results .",
    "the @xmath286folding model with large @xmath246 was statistically acceptable by the data , however upon visual comparison with the observed sample , there were apparent inconsistencies with number observed at @xmath295 , and the strength of the vertex of the distribution .",
    "the @xmath286folding model for large @xmath246 is similar to the dd models shown in  @xcite and @xcite , and therefore , these dd models can not be significantly rejected .",
    "however the relatively low likelihoods from the bayesian analysis present here suggests that this mechanism for sn  ia production is unlikely the dominant channel used by sn  ia progenitors .",
    "we also note that the detection of h@xmath296 in the spectra of sn  2002ic  @xcite can not by itself be taken as evidence against the dd scenario  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we tested two gaussian delay time distribution models . from the maximum likelihood tests , we find that a narrow dispersion of 1/5 the mean delay time is significantly more favored than a wide dispersion ( 1/2 the mean delay ) .",
    "this narrow gaussian model also better reproduces the observed redshift distribution of sne  ia .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dndt ] we show our best - fit models for the three delay time distribution functions .",
    "@xcite explore in detail four evolutionary channels which possibly produce sne  ia : the ignition of c in the core of a merged dd system , the ignition of central c induced by ignition in an accreted shell ( commonly called edge - lit detonation or eld ) from a he - rich rg companion , eld induced from a h - rich subgiant or ms companion , and the central c ignition from normal accretion ( no eld ) from a subgiant or ms companion .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows the expected delay time distributions for each channel .",
    "we reproduce the predicted distributions for the dd and ms models in figure  [ fig : dndt ] of this paper for comparisons to our best - fit models .",
    "as can be seen , there is some similarity between the  @xcite subgiant companion models and our best - fit gaussian models , specifically the narrow gaussian model , which is also largely inconsistent with what is expected from their dd models .",
    "this similarity can also be seen in comparison to general wd+ms models suggested by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our best - fit model does appear similar to the ms+wd ( with eld ) models in the range of the distribution , but it is different in that the width is larger and the peak is a few gyr later than what is expected from these models .",
    "this may suggest that these models are largely inconsistent with the data .",
    "however , it should be noted that the testing done in this paper does not exhaustively cover the possible range in characteristic delay times or widths of the distribution , and therefore some dissimilarity is expected .",
    "it is also important to note that systematic uncertainties have been largely ignored in this analysis .",
    "uncertainty in our models derive from the uncertainties in the derived control times .",
    "these errors stem from uncertainties in @xmath297 ( from the coefficients in the @xmath204 and stretch relations ) , uncertainties in the @xmath298 parameters , and the pseudo - shaw effect between epochs .",
    "when combined in quadrature , they result in systematic uncertainties which do not significantly effect the efficiency with redshift for the survey .",
    "the systematic uncertainties on the control times are shown in figure  [ fig : bigplot ] .",
    "we , therefore , do not account for these errors in the bayesian analysis .",
    "this analysis has used all transients identified as sne  ia in table  [ tab : sntable ] , regardless of the confidence in the identification .",
    "however , it is known that some sn  ib / c can have light curves and colors which are similar to sne  ia . therefore",
    ", some sne  ia could have been misidentified as bronze sne  cc , and conversely some sne  ib / c may pollute our bronze sn  ia category . however , there were no bronze sne  cc at @xmath299 , and only one bronze sn  ia at @xmath299 .",
    "if we considered all bronze sne  cc as additional sne  ia , the overall number will increase at lower redshifts , but there would be no additional sne  ia at @xmath299 . removing all bronze sne  ia",
    "also does not greatly affect the high-@xmath0 sample .",
    "neither rejection would relax the requirement of a substantially large mean delay time , thus the most significant conclusion of this study would remain intact .",
    "one could , however , expect minor changes to the width of the best - fit delay time distributions .",
    "the key implications of our results are that sne  ia are not prompt events , and generally require at least @xmath38 gyr to explode from formation .",
    "it is also likely that sn  ia progenitors prefer a specific channel to explosion , marked by a mean delay time of perhaps as long as @xmath300 gyr , with some scatter in the conditions of the channel .",
    "while the implied delay appears to be surprisingly long , this channel is apparently in the range of single degenerate systems which accrete from a main - sequence , or somewhat evolved , non - degenerate companions .",
    "the channel would be similar to that which produces supersoft x - ray sources  @xcite .",
