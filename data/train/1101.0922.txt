    "in this paper we consider intrahost models for malaria .",
    "these models describe the interaction of a parasite , namely a protozoa _ plasmodium falciparum _ , with its target cells , the red blood cells ( rbc ) . during the past decade",
    "there has been considerable work on the mathematical modeling of _ plasmodium falciparum _",
    "infection @xcite .",
    "a review has been done by molineaux and dietz in @xcite .",
    "we give a brief review of the features of malaria .",
    "malaria in a human begins with an inoculum of _ plasmodium _ parasites ( sporozoites ) from a female _ anopheles _ mosquito .",
    "the sporozoites enter the liver within minutes . after a period of asexual reproduction in the liver the parasites ( merozoites )",
    "are released in the bloodstream where the asexual erythrocyte cycle begins .",
    "the merozoites enter rbc , grow , and reproduce over a period of approximately @xmath5 hours after which the erythrocyte ruptures releasing 832  merozoites \" daughter parasites that quickly invade a fresh erythrocyte to renew the cycle",
    ". this blood cycle can be repeated many times , in the course of which some of the merozoites instead develop in the sexual form of the parasites : gametocytes .",
    "gametocytes are benign for the host and are waiting for the mosquitoes .",
    "the first mathematical model of the erythrocyte cycle was proposed by anderson , may , and gupta @xcite .",
    "this original model has been extended in different directions @xcite .    the original model @xcite is given by the following system : @xmath6 \\dot y= \\beta x \\ , m -\\mu_y \\,y ,   \\\\[-1pt ] \\dot m = r\\,\\mu_y \\,y -\\mu_m \\ , m -\\beta \\,x \\,m .",
    "\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    the state variables are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the variable @xmath7 denotes the concentration of uninfected rbc , @xmath8 the concentration of parasitized red blood cells ( prbc ) , and @xmath9 the concentration of the free merozoites in the blood .",
    "we briefly sketch the interpretation of the parameters .",
    "parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the death rates of the rbc , prbc , and free merozoites , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 is the contact rate between rbc and merozoites .",
    "uninfected blood cells are recruited at a constant rate @xmath14 from the bone marrow and have a natural life - expectancy of @xmath15  days .",
    "death of a prbc results in the release of an average number of @xmath16 merozoites .",
    "free merozoites die or successfully invade a rbc .",
    "this system is isomorphic to numerous systems considered in the mathematical modeling of virus dynamics ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "some authors ignore the loss term @xmath17 that should appear in the @xmath9 equation . indeed without this loss term , merozoites can infect rbc without themselves being absorbed , and this allows one merozoite _ to infect more than one rbc_.    = -1the original and the derived malaria models were intended to explain observations , namely parasitaemia , i.e. , the concentration @xmath8 of prbc and also the decrease of the healthy rbc leading to anaemia .",
    "an important characteristic of _ plasmodium falciparum _ ,",
    "the most virulent malaria parasite , is sequestration . at the halfway point of parasite development ,",
    "the infected erythrocyte leaves the circulating peripheral blood and binds to the endothelium in the microvasculature of various organs where the cycle is completed .",
    "a measurement of _ plasmodium falciparum _ parasitaemia taken from a blood smear therefore samples young parasites only .",
    "physician treating malaria use the number of parasites in peripheral blood smears as a measure of infection , and this does not give the total parasite burden of the patient . in some respects",
    "this is a weak point of the model ( [ amgori ] ) .",
    "moreover antimalarial drugs are known to act preferentially on different stages of parasite development .",
    "these facts lead some authors to give a general approach to modeling the age structure of _ plasmodium _ parasites @xcite .",
    "their model is a linear catenary compartmental model .",
    "this model is based on a finite number of compartments , each representing a stage of development of the parasite inside the prbc .",
    "the models describe only the dynamics of the morphological stage evolution of the parasites and make no allowance for the dynamics of the healthy rbc .    in this paper",
    "we propose a model which combines the advantages of the two approaches .",
    "we also consider this model with different strains for the parasites . to encompass the different models of the literature we allow , in this model , to ignore or not the loss term in the @xmath9 equation .",
    "to begin we consider the model with one strain : @xmath18 in this system @xmath19 is the density - dependent growth rate of rbc .",
    "the other parameters are positive . in the model of gravenor",
    "@xcite @xmath20 , and hence @xmath21 .",
    "we do not need this requirement , which implies that our model is not necessarily a catenary compartmental model . in the literature",
    "the parameter @xmath22 takes the values @xmath23 when the loss of the merozoite when it enters a rbc is ignored or takes @xmath24 when this loss is not ignored . in our analysis @xmath22 is simply a nonnegative parameter .",
    "except for these generalizations this system has already been suggested by gravenor and lloyd @xcite in their reply to the criticism of saul @xcite .",
    "we provide a global analysis of this system related to the basic reproduction ratio @xmath2 of the considered model .",
    "one problem is how to decide upon the number of parasite compartments in the model .",
    "a starting point can be the morphological appearance of the parasite .",
    "but if the objective is to reflect the distribution of cycle lengths , the number of compartment can be increased to obtain a gamma distribution .",
    "finally the two approaches can be combined : some compartments are for morphological reasons and others are for behavioral reasons . then this model can also be interpreted as the application of the method of stages ( or the linear chain trick ) to the life cycle of prbc @xcite . in other words",
    "a chain of compartments is included to generate a distribution of lags .",
    "it is also possible to add a class @xmath25 in order to allow for the production of gametocytes .",
    "different numbers of stages , ranging from 5 to 48 , are used in @xcite .",
    "it is well grounded that a _ falciparum _",
    "infection consists of distinct parasite genotypes .",
    "the model of anderson , may , and gupta has been extended in this direction @xcite . with regard to such features",
    "we propose a model with @xmath0 stages for the infected rbc , production of gametocytes , and @xmath1 genotypes , in the population of parasites .",
    "one of the important principles of theoretical ecology is the competitive exclusion principle which states that no two species can indefinitely occupy the same ecological niche @xcite .",
    "we provide a global analysis of this model and obtain a generic competitive exclusion result within one host individual .",
    "this confirms the simulation results obtained in @xcite .",
    "we compute the basic reproduction ratio @xmath2 of the model . for this model",
    "there is always a disease - free equilibrium ( dfe ) . to put",
    "it more precisely this equilibrium corresponds to the extinction of all the parasites , including the free parasites and the intraerythrocyte parasites .",
    "we prove that if @xmath3 , then the dfe is globally asymptotically stable ( gas ) ; in other words the parasites are cleared .",
    "if @xmath4 , then , generically , a unique endemic equilibrium exists corresponding to the extinction of all the strains of parasites but one .",
    "we prove that this equilibrium is gas on the positive orthant under a mild condition .",
    "for example this condition is automatically satisfied when @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 the criteria , obtained for deciding the winning strain , differs from other results in the literature . to each @xmath28-strain can be associated a basic reproduction number @xmath29 and a threshold @xmath30 .",
    "it turns out , when @xmath31 , that this is precisely this threshold @xmath30 which distinguishes the fate of the strain and not @xmath29 at the difference of @xcite .",
    "= -1the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce the model with @xmath0 stages for the infected rbc and one parasite strain , with and without gametocyte production .",
    "we compute the basic reproduction number and provide a stability analysis .    in section 3 we consider the model of anderson , may , and gupta with @xmath1 distinct genotypes and production of gametocytes .",
    "this model with a constant recruitment function for the erythrocytes , two strains , and one class of age has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have studied this model in @xcite . here using the computation of section 2 , we prove for the general @xmath1 strain @xmath0 class of age model that if @xmath3 , then the parasites are cleared and if @xmath4 , then generically the different genotypes can not coexist .",
    "namely a unique equilibrium exists , for which only one genotype is positive , and which is gas on a dense subset of the nonnegative orthant .",
    "this result confirms the simulations given in @xcite .",
    "global results of stability for the dfe as well for the endemic equilibrium for epidemic models are not so common @xcite .",
    "global stability results for the endemic equilibrium have often been obtained by using monotone system techniques @xcite .",
    "usually the poincar ",
    "bendixson property of monotone systems in dimension @xmath32 is used @xcite .",
    "our results generalize the results of @xcite .",
    "we consider a general class of systems . the haemopoiesis is a complex system . in the cited references the recruitment of rbc",
    "is given by @xmath33 . in this paper",
    "we will use a more general function @xmath34 . in a more complex system",
    "the haemopoiesis could be an input coming from another system : @xmath35 we denote by @xmath8 the column vector @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is nonnegative .",
    "the reason for this parameter is to encompass some malaria models in which the term @xmath37 can appear or not . in @xcite anderson",
    "has considered a system without the @xmath38 in the @xmath39 equation . in @xcite",
    "all the basic models of virus dynamics are also without this term .",
    "one feature of _ plasmodium falciparum _ , responsible for the deadly case of malaria , is that more than one parasite can invade rbc . in this case",
    "@xmath22 is the mean number of parasites invading rbc and thus disappearing from the circulating blood .",
    "some authors @xcite have included in the model production of gametocytes .",
    "in the course of the production of merozoites from bursting erythrocytes , some invading merozoites develop into the sexual , nonreplicating transmission stages known as gametocytes .",
    "the gametocytes are benign and transmissible to mosquitoes .",
    "we can also , following these authors , include a production of gametocytes in our model .",
    "if we denote by @xmath25 the  concentration of gametocytes , \" the model becomes @xmath40 we start to analyze the system with minimal hypothesis on @xmath41 but nevertheless plausible from the biological point of view .",
    "the function @xmath41 gives the production of erythrocytes from the bone marrow .",
    "the function @xmath42 models the population dynamic of rbc in the absence of parasites .",
    "the rbc have a finite lifetime , and then @xmath10 represents the average per capita death rate of rbc . the function @xmath41 models in some way homeostasis . in this paper",
    "we suppose that @xmath41 depends only on @xmath7 . it could be assumed that the recruitment function depends on @xmath7 and the total population of erythrocytes @xmath43 . in this paper",
    "we will analyze the simplified case which is the model considered in all the referenced literature .",
    "the rationale behind this simplification is that in a malaria primo - infection typically @xmath8 is in the order of @xmath44 to @xmath45 of the concentration of healthy erythrocytes @xmath7 .",
    "this can be confirmed from the data of malaria therapy . in the last century",
    "neurosyphilitic patients were given malaria therapy , which was routine care at that time .",
    "some of them were infected with _",
    "plasmodium falciparum_. data were collected at the national institutes of health laboratories in columbia , sc and milledgeville , ga during the period 1940 to 1963 @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath41 is a @xmath46 .",
    "since homeostasis is maintained we assume that the dynamic without parasites is asymptotically stable .",
    "in other words , for the system @xmath47 there exists a unique @xmath48 such that @xmath49      we will rewrite systems ( [ amgk ] ) and ( [ amgkgam ] ) in a condensed simpler form .    before we introduce some classical notation .",
