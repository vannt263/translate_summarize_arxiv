    "@xcite introduced his probability interpretation examining the case of inelastic scattering of an electron by an atom .",
    "he wrote the wave function of the electron long after and far away from the point of interaction as a superposition of wave functions for free electrons flying off in different directions . as in the case of the expansion in terms of energy eigenstates",

    "it is impossible to reconstruct what exactly jordan got from pauli , whose name occurs no less than seven times in the first three pages of _ neue begrndung _ i.    jordan wanted to use what he had learned from pauli to provide a new unified foundation for the laws of quantum mechanics by showing that they can be derived as ",
    "consequences of a few simple statistical assumptions \" @xcite .",
    "the central quantities in jordan s formalism are what he called `` probability amplitudes . ''",
    "this echoes born s ( 1926b , p.  804 ) term  probability waves \" for schrdinger wave functions but is an extremely broad generalization of born s concept .",
    "moreover , @xcite credited pauli rather than born with suggesting the term .",

    "_ neue begrndung _ ii , @xcite would discover that such a generalization is highly problematic .",
    "unaware of these complications and following pauli s lead , jordan interpreted @xmath51 as the conditional probability @xmath52 for finding a value between @xmath4 and @xmath53 for @xmath48 given that the system under consideration has been found to have the value @xmath2 for the quantity @xmath49 .",

    "as indicated above , jordan took an axiomatic approach in his _ neue begrndung _ papers . here",

    "in fact , jordan had been richard courant s assistant before becoming born s . in his _",
    "neue begrndung _ papers , jordan began with a series of postulates about his probability amplitudes and the rules they ought to obey ( the formulation and even the number of these postulates varied ) and then developed a formalism realizing these postulates .    a clear description of the task at hand can be found in a paper by david hilbert , lothar nordheim , and the other main protagonist of our story , john von neumann , who had come to gttingen in the fall of 1926 on a fellowship of the international education board @xcite . born in 1903 , von neumann was a year younger than dirac and jordan , who , in turn , were a year younger than heisenberg and two years younger than pauli .",

    "69 of these lecture notes ] to lay out his competitor s theory , but he quickly returned to his own , which he found simpler and more elegant.\"[dirac notes ] ] will give a rough illustration of how this works .",
    "one of the features that jordan saw as characteristic of quantum mechanics and that he therefore included among his postulates was that in quantum mechanics the simple addition and multiplication rules of ordinary probability theory for mutually exclusive and independent outcomes , respectively , apply to probability _ amplitudes _ rather than to the probabilities themselves .",
    "@xcite used the phrase  interference of probabilities \" for this feature .",
    "he once again credited pauli with the name for this phenomenon , even though @xcite had already talked about the  interference of    probability waves `` '' in his paper on quantum collisions .",
    "as we saw above , @xcite had discussed the feature itself in a subsequent paper , albeit only in the special case of schrdinger wave functions .",
    "@xcite was the first , at least in print , who explicitly recognized this feature in full generality .",
    "it is implicit in dirac s ( 1927 ) version of transformation theory , but dirac may well have shared the skepticism about the interference of probabilities that heisenberg expressed in a letter to jordan ( we will quote and discuss the relevant passage below ) .    as we will see in section 2.1 ,",
    "jordan s postulate about the addition and multiplication of probability amplitudes basically boils down to the requirement that the amplitudes @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath62 with purely continuous spectra satisfy the relation @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see intuitively , though much harder to prove rigorously ( see section 1.2 ) , that this relation is indeed satisfied if these three amplitudes are equated with the transformation matrices  in the notation of @xcite explained above@xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively .",

    "dirac actually used the notation @xmath74 in his handwritten letters and manuscripts during this period , but apparently did not mind that this was rendered as @xmath75 in print . ]",
    "this brings us to an important difference between jordan s and dirac s versions of their statistical transformation theory . for dirac ,",
    "the transformation element was primary , for jordan the statistical element was .",
    "most of dirac s ( 1927 ) paper is devoted to the development of the formalism that allowed him to represent the laws of quantum mechanics in different yet equivalent ways ( secs .",

    "canonical transformations had been central to the development of matrix mechanics ( born and jordan , 1925 ; born , heisenberg , and jordan , 1926 ; see section 2.2 below ) .",
    "prior to _ neue begrndung _",
    "i , @xcite had actually published two important papers on the implementation of canonical transformations in matrix mechanics @xcite .",
    "jordan s use of canonical transformations in his _ neue begrndung _ papers was twofold .",
    "first , as already mentioned above , jordan tried to show that integral kernels in canonical transformations have all the properties that probability amplitudes must satisfy according to his postulates .",
    "second , he tried to use canonical transformations to derive differential equations for probability amplitudes for arbitrary quantities ( such as the time - independent schrdinger equation for @xmath86 ) from the trivial differential equations satisfied by the probability amplitude for @xmath87 for some generalized coordinate @xmath54 and its conjugate momentum @xmath88 that he started from .",
    "the ` mind your @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s ' part of the title of our paper refers to the crucial role of canonical transformations and conjugate variables in jordan s formalism .    both ways in which jordan relied on canonical transformations in his _ neue begrndung _ papers turned out to be problematic and resulted in serious mathematical problems for his version of statistical transformation theory .",
    "these problems do not affect dirac s version since @xcite only relied on canonical transformations in very loose sense .",
    "however , as we will see once we have introduced some modern tools to analyze the dirac - jordan theory in section 1.2 , the two versions of the theory do share a number of other mathematical problems .",
    "the ` never mind your @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s ' part of our title thus does not refer to dirac s version of statistical transformation theory , but to the fundamentally different hilbert space formalism that @xcite introduced as an alternative to the dirac - jordan theory ( section 1.3 ) .    to conclude this subsection",
    ", we briefly indicate how jordan ran into problems with his twofold use of canonical transformations in _ neue begrndung _ and explain why those problems do not plague dirac s version of the theory .",
    "we return to these problems in section 1.2 , relying more heavily on modern concepts and notation , and analyze them in greater detail in sections 2 and 4 , again helping ourselves to modern tools . as @xcite wrote in the passage from his contribution to the pauli memorial volume quoted above ,",
    "dirac only considered _",
    "unitary _ transformations in his transformation theory .",
    "unitary transformations of hermitian operators preserve their hermiticity .",
    "unfortunately , there are many canonical transformations that are not unitary @xcite . in _",
    "neue begrndung _",
    "i , jordan therefore tried to develop a formalism that would allow quantities that , from a modern point of view , correspond to _ non_-hermitian operators .",
    "as long as the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to hermitian operators , the probability amplitude @xmath47 is the integral kernel of a unitary transformation and the conditional probability @xmath52 is equal to @xmath51 . in such cases ,",
    "the integral kernel @xmath47 is simply identical to dirac s unitary transformation matrix @xmath65 .",
    "as soon as @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 are non - hermitian , however , @xmath47 is the integral kernel of a non - unitary transformation and the expression for @xmath52 becomes more complicated , involving both the probability amplitude itself and what jordan called a  supplementary amplitude \" ( _ ergnzungsamplitude _ ) .",
    "following the lead of @xcite , jordan dropped the _ ergnzungsamplitude _ in _ neue begrndung _ ii .",
    "the price he paid for this was what , from the point of view of classical mechanics , amounted to the rather arbitrary restriction of the canonical transformations allowed in his theory to unitary ones .",
    "the other main problem that jordan ran into with his use of canonical transformations is directly related to his axiomatic approach .",
    "unlike dirac , jordan wanted to derive the entire theory from his statistical postulates .",
    "this meant , for instance , that jordan did not include the canonical commutation relation , @xmath89 \\equiv \\hat{p } \\hat{q } - \\hat{q } \\hat{p } = h/2\\pi i$ ] ( where @xmath90 is planck s constant ) , among his postulates . nor",
    "did he assume the usual association of the momentum @xmath88 conjugate to @xmath54 with the differential operator @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 ) acting on wave functions in @xmath1-space .",
    "dirac assumed both these elements . instead of the commutation relation for @xmath88 and @xmath54 , @xcite assumed that the probability amplitude @xmath87 for these two quantities had a particularly simple form  in our notation : @xmath93",
    "this then is how planck s constant enters jordan s formalism .",
    "normally , the canonical commutation relation @xmath89 = \\hbar / i$ ] defines what it means for @xmath88 and @xmath54 to be canonically conjugate variables .",
    "jordan , however , defined @xmath88 and @xmath54 to be canonically conjugate if and only if @xmath93 . and @xmath1 are two quantities for which there is this particular probability [ amplitude ] then one can draw conclusions from that and if one defines multiplication afterwards , then one gets the commutation rules .",
    "the goal was to not make the commutation rules the starting point but to obtain them as the result of something else .",
    "the basic rules of the formulation should be conceived of as statements about probability amplitudes \" ( session 3 , pp .",

    "it was not until _ neue begrndung _ ii , written in copenhagen on an international education board fellowship and received by _ zeitschrift fr physik _ on june 3 , 1927 , that jordan realized that this strategy for deriving schrdinger - type differential equations for his probability amplitudes was severely limited .",

    "i was restricted to quantities with continuous spectra , to cover quantities with partly or wholly discrete spectra as well . the key problem ( as we will show using modern tools at the end of section 2.3 ) , is that quantities related by a canonical transformation have the same spectrum .",
    "it follows that jordan s procedure to get from the differential equations for probability amplitudes for one pair of quantities to those for another pair fails as soon as one pair has purely continuous spectra ( such as @xmath88 and @xmath54 ) and the other pair has partly or wholly discrete spectra ( such as , typically , the hamiltonian ) . in response to this problem",

    "jordan s definition , however , led to such counter - intuitive propositions as different components of spin qualifying as canonically conjugate to one another . ) was that it would be applicable to spin as well .",
    "only when kuhn reminded him that this application must have come later , did jordan give the answer we quoted in note [ jordan interview ] .",
    "later in the interview , kuhn explicitly asked him how he felt about the idea of taking two components of spin to be conjugate to one another .",

    "the breakdown of the ordinary commutation relations did make room for jordan s introduction of anti - commutation relations ( ibid .",

    "jordan , 1927h ; jordan and wigner , 1928 ; and the coda to our paper ) ]    all in all , the state of affairs by the end of _ neue begrndung _ ii can fairly be characterized as follows .",
    "jordan was still trying to rely on the classical formalism of canonical transformations and conjugate variables to build up the formalism realizing the postulates for his quantum - mechanical probability amplitudes .",
    "however , these classical concepts had to be stretched almost beyond the breaking point to arrive at a satisfactory formulation of his quantum theory .      from a modern point of view ,",

    "the reason we used scare quotes in the preceding sentence is that for quantities with completely continuous spectra , to which jordan restricted himself in _ neue begrndung _",
    "i , the ` eigenvectors ' of the corresponding operators are _ not _ elements of hilbert space . that in modern quantum mechanics they are nonetheless routinely treated _ as if _ they are vectors in hilbert space with inner products such as @xmath98 is justified by the spectral theorem for the relevant operators .    of course , neither the spectral theorem nor the notions of an abstract hilbert space and of operators acting in it were available when jordan and dirac published their respective versions of transformation theory in 1927 .",
    "the hilbert space formalism and the spectral theorem were only introduced later that year , by @xcite , and two more years passed before @xcite published a rigorous proof of the spectral theorem .",
    "so even though @xcite introduced the notation @xmath65 for what jordan wrote as @xmath47 , dirac , like jordan , did _ not _ at that time conceive of these quantities as ` inner products ' of two more elementary quantities ( see note [ darrigol ] ) .",
    "although dirac later did accept the split ( once again see note [ darrigol ] ) , probability amplitudes remained the fundamental quantities for jordan @xcite .",
    "once the ` inner - product ' structure of probability amplitudes is recognized and justified with the help of the spectral theorem , jordan s basic axioms about the addition and multiplication of probability amplitudes are seen to reduce to statements about orthogonality and completeness familiar from elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , as we mentioned in section 1.1 , jordan s postulates demand that the probability amplitudes @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for quantities @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath62 with purely continuous spectra satisfy the relation @xmath101 .",
    "once probability amplitudes are identified with ` inner products ' of ` eigenvectors ' ( appropriately normalized , such that , e.g. , @xmath102 @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the dirac delta function ) , the familiar completeness relation , @xmath105 ( which holds on account of the resolution of unity , @xmath106 , corresponding to the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath49 ) , guarantees that @xmath101 . in this sense",
    ", the hilbert space formalism thus provides a realization of jordan s postulates .    in the absence of the hilbert space formalism and the spectral theorem , jordan relied on the formalism of canonical transformations to develop the analytical apparatus realizing his axiomatic scheme .",

    "@xmath107 are _ mutually unbiased bases_. ] this special probability amplitude , to reiterate , trivially satisfies two simple differential equations .",
    "jordan then considered canonical transformations to other canonically conjugate variables @xmath108 and @xmath109 and derived differential equations for arbitrary probability amplitudes starting from the ones for @xmath87 . in this way",
    ", he claimed , one could recover both the time - independent and the time - dependent schrdinger equations as examples of such equations .",
    "both claims are problematic .",
    "the recovery of the time - dependent schrdinger equation requires that we look upon the time @xmath110 not as a parameter as we would nowadays but as an operator to be expressed in terms of the operators @xmath88 and @xmath54 .",
    "more importantly , jordan s construction only gets us to the time - independent schrdinger equation for hamiltonians with fully continuous spectra . in _ neue begrndung _",
    "i , jordan deliberately restricted himself to quantities with completely continuous spectra , confident at that point that his approach could easily be generalized to quantities with wholly or partly discrete spectra .",
    "he eventually had to accept that this generalization fails .",
    "the problem , as he himself recognized in _ neue begrndung _ ii , is that two quantities @xmath111 and @xmath88 related to each other via a canonical transformation ( implemented by the similarity transformation @xmath112 ) always have the same spectrum . ) at the end of section 2.3 for a simple proof of this claim in modern language . ] hence , no canonical transformation that can be implemented in this way can take us from quantities such as @xmath88 and @xmath54 with a completely continuous spectrum to a hamiltonian with a wholly or partly discrete spectrum .",
    "the quantities @xmath113 in jordan s formalism do double duty as probability amplitudes and as integral kernels of canonical transformations . even if we accept the restriction to quantities with fully continuous spectra for the moment , jordan could not quite get his formalism to work , at least not at the level of generality he had hoped for . in hindsight , we can see that another major hurdle was that canonical transformations from one set of conjugate variables to another , although they do preserve the spectra , do _ not _ always preserve the hermitian character of the operators associated with these variables in quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "he had a particularly hard time dealing with the purely discrete spectrum of the recently introduced spin observable .",

    "@xcite calls the latter  a mathematically advanced development of the dirac - jordan transformation theory . \"",
    "@xcite writes that  von neumann appears to follow exactly the program as set out in his previous paper with hilbert and nordheim . \" and in our paper on the path to _ neue begrndung _ , we wrote :  in the process of providing sound mathematical underpinnings of jordan s transformation theory , von neumann introduced the idea of representing quantum - mechanical states by vectors or rays in hilbert space \" @xcite . ]",

    "von neumann contrasted wave mechanics with  transformation theory \" or  statistical theory , \" once again reflecting the difference in emphasis between dirac and jordan . yet , despite his thorough understanding of it , von neumann did not care for the dirac - jordan approach .",
    "von neumann s best - known objection concerns the inevitable use of delta functions in the dirac - jordan approach .",
    "however , von neumann also objected to the use of probability amplitudes .",
    "jordan s basic amplitude , @xmath93 , is not in the space @xmath114 of square - integrable functions that forms one instantiation of abstract hilbert space .",

    "it is true that the probabilities appearing as end results are invariant , \" he granted in the introduction of his paper ,  but it is unsatisfactory and unclear why this detour through the unobservable and non - invariant is necessary \" @xcite .",
    "so , rather than following the jordan - dirac approach and looking for ways to mend its mathematical shortcomings , von neumann , as indicated in the passage from his 1932 book quoted above , adopted an entirely new approach .",

    "the only elements that von neumann took from transformation theory  more specifically jordan s version of it  were , first , jordan s basic idea that quantum mechanics is ultimately a set of rules for conditional probabilities @xmath52 , and second , the fundamental assumption that such probabilities are given by the absolute square of the corresponding probability amplitudes , which essentially boils down to the born rule . ) , von neumann had no reason to dislike born s work . and",
    "he did cite born in the second paper of his 1927 trilogy on quantum mechanics @xcite . ]",
    "von neumann derived a new expression for conditional probabilities in quantum mechanics that avoids probability amplitudes altogether and instead sets them equal to the trace of products of projection operators , as they are now called . instead of the term ` projection operator ' ,",
    "von neumann used the term _ einzeloperator _ ( or _ e.op .  _ for short ; cf .",
    "note [ e.op . ] ) .",
    "the probability @xmath52 , e.g. , is given by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are projection operators onto , in dirac notation , the ` eigenvectors ' @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "unlike probability amplitudes , these projection operators do not have any phase ambiguity .",

    "the projection operator @xmath118 does not change if the ket @xmath119 is replaced by @xmath120 and the bra @xmath121 accordingly by @xmath122 .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that , just as jordan and dirac with their probability amplitudes / transformation functions @xmath98 , von neumann did not think of his projection operators as constructed out of bras and kets , thus avoiding the problem that many of these bras and kets are not in hilbert space .    toward the end of his paper",
    ", @xcite noted that his trace expression for conditional probabilities is invariant under  canonical transformations . \"",
    "what von neumann called canonical transformations , however , are not jordan s canonical transformations but simply , in modern terms , unitary transformations . such transformations automatically preserve hermiticity and the need for something like jordan s _ ergnzungsamplitude _ simply never arises .",

    "this then is what the ` never mind your @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s ' part of the title of our paper refers to . by avoiding conjugate variables and canonical transformations , von neumann completely steered clear of the problem that ultimately defeated jordan s attempt to derive all of quantum mechanics from his set of axioms , namely that canonical transformations can never get us from @xmath88 s and @xmath54 s with fully continuous spectra to quantities with wholly or partly discrete spectra , such as the hamiltonian .    in _",
    "mathematische begrndung _ , von neumann not only provided an alternative to jordan s analysis of probabilities in quantum mechanics , he also provided an alternative to the dirac - jordan transformation - theory approach to proving the equivalence of matrix mechanics and wave mechanics @xcite .",

    "he showed that matrix mechanics and wave mechanics correspond to two instantiations of abstract hilbert space , the space @xmath129 of square - summable sequences and the space @xmath114 of square - integrable functions , respectively @xcite .",

    "wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischer aufbau _ he sought to derive this trace formula , and thereby the born rule , from more fundamental assumptions about probability . drawing on ideas of von mises ( see note [ von mises ] ) , von neumann started by introducing probabilities in terms of selecting members from large ensembles of systems .",
    "he then made two very general and _ prima facie _ perfectly plausible assumptions about expectation values of quantities defined on such ensembles @xcite . from those assumptions , some assumptions about the repeatability of measurements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , p.  262",
    "note [ neumann heisenberg ] ) , and key features of his hilbert space formalism ( especially some assumptions about the association of observables with hermitian operators ) , von neumann did indeed manage to recover the born rule .",
    "admittedly , the assumptions needed for this result are not as innocuous as they look at first sight .",
    "they are essentially the same as those that go into von neumann s infamous no - hidden - variable proof @xcite .    along the way @xcite introduced what we now call a density operator to characterize the ensemble of systems he considered .",
    "he found that the expectation value of an observable represented by some operator @xmath48 in an ensemble characterized by @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 , where we used the modern notation @xmath130 for the density operator ( von neumann used the letter @xmath132 ) .",
    "this result holds both for what @xcite called a  pure \" ( _ rein _ ) or  uniform \" ( _ einheitlich _ ) ensemble ( p.  255 ) , consisting of identical systems in identical states , and for what he called a  mixture \" ( _ gemisch _ ) ( p.  265 ) .",
    "so the result is more general than the born rule , which obtains only in the former case .",
    "von neumann went on to show that the density operator for a uniform ensemble is just the projection operator onto the ray in hilbert space corresponding to the state of all systems in this ensemble .",
    "however , he found it unsatisfactory to characterize the state of a physical system by specifying a ray in hilbert space .",
    " our knowledge of a system , \" @xcite wrote ,  is never described by the specification of a state   but , as a rule , by the results of experiments performed on the system . \" in this spirit , he considered the simultaneous measurement of a maximal set of commuting operators and constructed the density operator for an ensemble where what is known is that the corresponding quantities have values in certain intervals .",
    "he showed that such measurements can fully determine the state and that the density operator in that case is once again the projection operator onto the corresponding ray in hilbert space .",
    "von neumann thus arrived at the typical quantum - mechanical way of conceiving of a physical problem nowadays , which is very different from the classical way to which jordan was still wedded in _",
    "neue begrndung_. in classical mechanics , as well as in jordan s version of transformation theory , the full description of a physical system requires the specification of a complete set of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s . in quantum mechanics , as was first made clear in von neumann s _ wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischer aufbau _ , it requires the specification of the eigenvalues of all the operators in a maximal set of commuting operators for the system . in other words ,",

    "the postulates of jordan s _ neue begrndung _ papers amount to a concise formulation of the fundamental tenets of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics . building on insights of born and pauli , @xcite was the first to state _ in full generality _ that probabilities in quantum mechanics are given by the absolute square of what he called probability amplitudes .",
    "he was also the first to recognize in full generality the peculiar rules for combining probability amplitudes . ) .",
    "] however , after laying down these rules in a set of postulates , he did not fully succeed in constructing a satisfactory formalism realizing those postulates .",
    "as we argued in this paper , jordan was lacking the requisite mathematical tools to do so , namely abstract hilbert space and the spectral theorem for operators acting in hilbert space . instead , jordan drew on the canonical formalism of classical mechanics .",
    "jordan was steeped in this formalism , which had played a central role in the transition from the old quantum theory to matrix mechanics @xcite as well as in the further development of the new theory , to which jordan had made a number of significant contributions @xcite .",
    "most importantly in view of the project jordan pursued in _ neue begrndung _",
    ", he had published two papers the year before @xcite , in which he had investigated the implementation of canonical transformations in matrix mechanics @xcite . as he put it in his ahqp interview ( see section 2.2 for the full quotation ) , canonically conjugate variables and canonical transformations had thus been his  daily bread \" in the years leading up to _ neue begrndung_.    unfortunately , as we saw in sections 2 and 4 , this formalism ",
    "the @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s of the title of our paper  proved ill - suited to the task at hand .",
    "as a result , jordan ran into a number of serious problems .",
    "first , it turns out to be crucially important for the probability interpretation of the formalism that only hermitian operators be allowed .",
    "unfortunately , canonical transformations can turn @xmath88 s and @xmath54 s corresponding to hermitian operators into new @xmath108 s and @xmath109 s corresponding to non - hermitian ones .",
    "initially , jordan hoped to make room in his formalism for quantities corresponding to non - hermitian operators by introducing the so - called _ ergnzungsamplitude _ ( see section 2.4 ) .",
    "eventually , following the lead of @xcite , he dropped the _ ergnzungsamplitude _ , which forced him to restrict the class of allowed canonical transformations ( rather arbitrarily from the point of view of classical mechanics ) to those preserving hermiticity .",
    "the difficulties facing jordan s approach became particularly severe when , in _ neue begrndung _ ii , @xcite tried to extend his formalism , originally formulated only for quantities with purely continuous spectra , to quantities with wholly or partly discrete spectra .",
    "one problem with this extension was that , whereas canonical transformations do not necessarily preserve hermiticity , they _ do _ preserve the spectra of the @xmath88 s and @xmath54 s to which they are applied .",
    "hence , there is no canonical transformation that connects the generalized coordinate @xmath54 , which has a continuous spectrum , to , for instance , the hamiltonian @xmath55 , which , in general , will have at least a partly discrete spectrum . as jordan s construction of a realization of his postulates hinged on the existence of a canonical transformation connecting @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ", this presented an insurmountable obstacle .",
    "the newly introduced spin variables further exposed the limitations of jordan s canonical formalism . to subsume these variables under his general approach ,",
    "jordan had to weaken his definition of canonically conjugate quantities to such an extent that the concept lost much of its meaning . under jordan s definition in _ neue begrndung _ ii , any two of the three components @xmath598 , @xmath934 , and @xmath599 of spin angular momentum are canonically conjugate to each other .",
    "all these problems can be avoided if the canonical formalism of classical mechanics is replaced by the hilbert space formalism , even though other mathematical challenges remain .",
    "when jordan s probability amplitudes @xmath47 for the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are equated with ` inner products ' @xmath98 of normalized ` eigenvectors ' of the corresponding operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the rules for such amplitudes , as laid down in the postulates of jordan s _ neue begrndung _ , are automatically satisfied .",
    "probabilities are given by the absolute square of these inner products , and jordan s addition and multiplication rules for probability amplitudes essentially reduce to the familiar completeness and orthogonality relations in hilbert space ( see section 2.1 , eq .  ) .",
    "once the hilbert space formalism is adopted , the need to sort quantities into @xmath88 s and @xmath54 s disappears .",
    "canonical transformations , at least in the classical sense as understood by jordan , similarly cease to be important . instead of canonical transformations @xmath935 of pairs of canonically conjugate quantities ,",
    "one now considers unitary transformations @xmath936 of individual hermitian operators .",
    "such transformations get us from one orthonormal basis of hilbert space to another , preserving inner products as required by the probability interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "the hilbert space formalism was introduced by @xcite in _ mathematische begrndung_. however , von neumann did not use this formalism to provide a realization of jordan s postulates along the lines sketched in the preceding paragraph . as we saw in section 5 , von neumann had some fundamental objections to the approach of jordan ( and dirac ) . the basic probability amplitude for @xmath88 and @xmath54 in jordan s formalism ,",
    "@xmath324 ( see eq .  ) , is not a square - integrable function and is thus not an element of the space @xmath114 instantiating abstract hilbert space .",
    "the delta function , unavoidable in the dirac - jordan formalism , is no function at all .",
    "moreover , von neumann objected to the phase - ambiguity of the probability amplitudes .",
    "jordan s response to this last objection illustrates the extent to which he was still trapped in thinking solely in terms of @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s . in _",
    "neue begrndung _ ii , he eliminated the phase - ambiguity of the probability amplitude for any two quantities by adding two indices indicating a specific choice of the quantities canonically conjugate to those two quantities ( see section 4 , eqs .   ) .",
    "von neumann s response to this same problem was very different and underscores that he was not wedded at all to the canonical formalism of classical mechanics .",
    "von neumann decided to avoid probability amplitudes altogether .",
    "instead he turned to projection operators in hilbert space , which he used both to formulate the spectral theorem and to construct a new formula for conditional probabilities in quantum mechanics ( see eq .",
    "and eq .  ) .",
    "although von neumann took jordan s formula for conditional probabilities as his starting point and rewrote it in terms of projection operators , his final formula is more general than jordan s in that it pertains both to pure and to mixed states .",
    "however , it was not until the next installment of his 1927 trilogy , _ wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischer aufbau _ , that @xcite carefully defined the difference between pure and mixed states . in this paper ,",
    "von neumann freed his approach from reliance on jordan s even further ( see section 6 ) .",
    "he now derived his formula for conditional probabilities in terms of the trace of products of projection operators from the hilbert space formalism , using a few seemingly innocuous assumptions about expectation values of observables of systems in an ensemble of copies of those systems characterized by a density operator .",
    "he then showed that the density operator for a uniform ensemble is just the projection operator onto the corresponding pure dispersion - free state .",
    "such pure states can be characterized completely by the eigenvalues of a complete set of commuting operators .",
    "this led von neumann to a new way of formulating a typical problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "rather than identifying @xmath88 s and @xmath54 s for the system under consideration , he realized that it suffices to specify the values of a maximal set of commuting operators for the system .",
    "all operators in such sets can be thought of as @xmath54 s .",
    "there is no need to find the @xmath88 s canonically conjugate to these @xmath54 s .",
    "in this paper , we emphasized the difficulties engendered by jordan s insistence on the primacy of canonical @xmath347 variables in expressing the dynamics of general quantum - mechanical systems ( see especially section 4 on _ neue begrndung _ ii ) .",
    "these difficulties became particularly acute in the case of systems with observables with purely or partially discrete spectra , of which the most extreme case is perhaps the treatment of electron spin ( see eqs .",
    " ) . here , the arbitrary choice of two out of the three spin components to serve as a non - commuting canonically conjugate pair clearly reveals the artificiality of this program .    in a sense , however , jordan was perfectly right to insist on the importance of a canonical approach , even for particles with spin .",
    "in hindsight , his error was simply to attempt to impose this structure at the level of non - relativistic quantum theory , where electron spin appears as an essentially mysterious internal attribute that must be grafted onto the nonrelativistic kinematics ( which does have a perfectly sensible canonical interpretation ) .",
    "once electron spin was shown to emerge naturally at the relativistic level , and all aspects of the electron s dynamics were subsumed in the behavior of a local relativistic field , canonical ` @xmath0 & @xmath1 ' thinking could be reinstated in a perfectly natural way .",
    "this was first done explicitly by @xcite in their seminal paper on lagrangian field theory . in modern notation",
    ", they introduced a relativistically invariant action for a spin-@xmath133 field , as a spacetime integral of a lagrangian : @xmath937 here the field @xmath938 is a four - component field , with the @xmath939 @xmath940 the @xmath941 dirac matrices . a conjugate momentum _",
    "@xmath942 is then defined in the standard fashion , with canonical equal - time _ anti_-commutation relations imposed  as indicated by earlier work by @xcite and @xcite  in order to insert the desired fermionic statistics of the particles described by the field , @xmath943 the transition from a lagrangian to a hamiltonian ( density ) is then carried out in the usual way @xmath944 the spatial integral of this hamiltonian energy density would within a few years be shown to describe exactly the free hamiltonian for arbitrary multi - particle states of non - interacting electrons and positrons , degenerate in mass and each displaying the usual panoply of spin-@xmath133 behavior which had finally been deciphered , in the non - relativistic context , by the atomic spectroscopy of the mid to late 1920s .",
    "the essential point is that the relevant @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s appearing in the theory are not associated with the first - quantized wave - functions or state vectors appropriate for a non - relativistic treatment , but rather with the _ fields _ that must replace them once a fully relativistic theory takes center stage .",
