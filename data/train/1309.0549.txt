    "time dilation measurements via precise optical spectroscopy have played a long and distinguished role in testing the predictions of special relativity ( sr ) , and have recently also contributed to constraining coefficients in the lorentz- and cpt - violating standard - model extension ( sme )  @xcite .",
    "the first reported observation of time dilation in sr in 1938 , by ives and stilwell , was based on measuring the relativistic doppler effect in fast hydrogen atoms  @xcite . in the decades after this landmark experiment ,",
    "other methods tested time dilation with increasing sensitivity , such as lifetime measurements of elementary particles accelerated to relativistic energies , transverse doppler effect measurements with rotating mssbauer setups , and comparisons between ground - based and rocket - mounted clocks ( for a review and references see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "two major breakthroughs allowed optical spectroscopy to re - enter the field , and to dominate it since : tunable , single - mode lasers in the 1970s and heavy - ion storage rings , providing electron - cooled ion beams of exquisite energy definition and transverse emittance , in the 1980s .",
    "this has led to the measurement of absolute optical transition frequencies at the @xmath1 level on near - relativistic beams  @xcite , possibly the most accurate measurement ever performed with accelerated particle beams .",
    "an atom or ion is moving with velocity @xmath2 in the laboratory .",
    "a transition between two levels in this atom can be driven in its rest frame by radiation of frequency @xmath3 . a light source in the laboratory frame , according to the relativistic doppler effect , needs to be tuned to the frequency @xmath4 such that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative velocity between the atom and the laboratory frame , and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the angle between @xmath2 and the wavevector of the radiation exciting the atom , as measured in the laboratory frame .",
    "testing time dilation , i.e. , @xmath9 , requires the precise determination of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 . in reality , it is generally not possible to determine the velocity of an accelerated particle beam with the required precision .",
    "therefore , experiments need to remove the first - order dependence on @xmath6 . at @xmath10 one could observe a purely transverse doppler effect , but due to the sensitivity to angular misalignment , this turns out not to be a workable scheme .",
    "geometries with @xmath11 , while robust against misalignments , appear to suffer from the presence of the full first - order doppler effect .",
    "nevertheless , atomic spectroscopy provides several well - established techniques to eliminate the first - order doppler effect , turning a collinear setup into the method of choice .",
    "commercially available single - mode lasers have much higher monochromaticity ( @xmath12 ) than accelerated particle beams ( @xmath13-@xmath14 ) . in a scenario with two lasers , one ( at a fixed frequency ) can be used to ` mark ' a narrow velocity class within the particle beam s velocity distribution such that a second , frequency - tunable , laser performs spectroscopy only on that specific class of atoms .",
    "the first generation of storage ring measurements ( 1990 - 94 ) used li@xmath15 stored at @xmath16 in the tsr storage ring  @xcite .",
    "it used a doppler - free technique known as @xmath17-spectroscopy , which is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "two lasers with laboratory frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 counter- and co - propagate with the ions and excite both legs of the @xmath17 at the frequencies @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the ions rest frame . only if both lasers are exciting the _ same _ velocity class do atoms get pumped back and forth , producing significant fluorescence . within sr",
    ", the resonance conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 give the relation @xmath24 .",
    "deviations from relativity can be parametrized in a model - independent way by a velocity - dependent term @xmath25 as @xmath26 which can be expanded , for @xmath27 , as @xmath28 .",
    "the tsr-1 experiment yielded a new , best time dilation limit of @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the experimental limitation was an unexpectedly broad lineshape , with a width of 54 mhz , vs. 7.6 mhz expected from the natural linewidth of the transition .",
    "the second - generation tsr-2 experiment ( 2000 - 06 ) revealed the problem : the ` marking ' of a velocity class by one laser and the ` sampling ' of it by the other are generally not concurrent in @xmath17-spectroscopy and velocity - changing collisions lead to broadening .",
    "the tsr-2 experiment solved this problem by employing a different doppler - free technique : saturation spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "its signature feature , the lamb dip , only occurs when both lasers _ simultaneously _ interact with the same individual ion .",
    "linewidths approaching the natural linewidth were observed , and a much improved limit was obtained : @xmath30  @xcite . ultimately , the method is limited by its reliance on saturation , i.e. , the need to scatter many photons . at the intensities required for saturation ,",
    "the lasers exert a rather strong force on the ions , distorting the velocity distribution significantly . in saturation spectroscopy",
    ", we observe a small _ drop _ in fluorescence ( the lamb dip ) on top of a large doppler - broadened background . in @xmath31-spectroscopy",
    ", we detect a narrow fluorescence _ peak _ , while the rest of the velocity distribution remains dark .",
    "with the spectroscopy reaching its limitations , higher ion velocities are the obvious avenue for further improvements . at the storage ring esr",
    ", the same experiment can be carried out at @xmath32 , where the doppler shifts are extraordinary  @xcite : for @xmath33 nm , the laser frequencies in the laboratory frame are @xmath34 nm and @xmath35 nm .",
    "saturation spectroscopy turned out not to be viable due to the required intensity for the uv light . @xmath17-spectroscopy proved robust ; while the excess broadening was comparable to the tsr-1 situation ( @xmath36 mhz ) , the much larger @xmath6 more than compensates and tighter limits result : an upper limit for @xmath37 in the lower @xmath38 range seems in reach  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , tsr-2 and esr will be able to set combined limits of @xmath30 and @xmath39 .",
    "ultimately , it would be intriguing to implement high - resolution spectroscopy at facilities that provide highly relativistic ion beams , like the upcoming high - energy storage ring ( hesr ) at fair .",
    "if the rest - frame frequencies @xmath40 are nearly identical and in the visible region , at high boosts @xmath41 will eventually be beyond the near - uv region .",
    "a possible solution would be an _",
    "@xmath17 , such that standard lasers can drive it in a low-@xmath6 measurement ( e.g. , one in the visible and one in the near / mid - infrared ) . in the high - boost version ,",
    "the co - propagating laser will drive the short leg ( which will be blue - shifted toward the visible ) and the counter - propagating laser will excite the long leg ( which will be red - shifted toward the infrared )",
    ". the challenge will be to identify a suitable transition in a highly charged ion ."
