    "<S> the landauer - buttiker formalism is used to model samples with mobilities and rashba coupling strengths of current experiments and to demonstrate the appearance of a measurable rashba - coupling dependent voltage . </S>",
    "<S> this type of measurement requires only metal contacts , i.e. , no magnetic elements are present . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the robustness of the intrinsic spin - hall effect against disorder in the mesoscopic metallic regime in agreement with results of exact diagonalization studies in the bulk .    </S>",

    "<S> the control of spin and spin - currents without applying external magnetic fields can be achieved through the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , which acts as an effective momentum - dependent zeeman field . within this context , </S>",
    "<S> the newly discovered intrinsic spin - hall effect ( she ) in p - doped semicondcutors by murakami _ </S>",

    "<S> @xcite offers new possibilites for spin current manipulation and generation in high mobility paramagnetic semiconductor systems . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic spin - hall effect represents a spin - current response generated perpendicular to the driving electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the spins are tilted out of the plane due to the torque imparted by the so coupling induced effective zeeman field . in the rashba </S>",
    "<S> so coupled 2dess the bulk intrinsic spin - hall conductivity was found to have a value of @xmath0 in the clean limit for the case of both spin - split subbands being occupied and decreases linearly with the electron density for single spin - split subband occupation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the she discovery has generated a tremendous interest in the research community @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the long - standing debate on the origin of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) @xcite , the robustness of the bulk intrinsic she against disorder and how it is related to the scattering mediated extrinsic spin - hall effect @xcite , has been the focus of an intense theoretical debate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while it was understood originally @xcite that , unlike the quantum hall effect , the universal value of the intrinsic she in the rasbha so coupled 2dess will be reduced whenever the disorder broadening is larger or similar to the so coupling splitting , as was verified within a standard born - approximation treatment @xcite , taking into account the ladder vertex corrections through various methods suggests that the bulk spin - hall conductivity vanishes in the weak disorder dc - limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these results have been challenged by other analytical calculations which also consider ladder vertex corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other recent studies @xcite , using arguments that echo the long - standing debate between skew and side - jump scattering in the ahe , have argued that the intrinsic she vanishes in all regimes .    given the ferraginous collection of analytical results , unbiased numerical calculations are needed to shed light on this controversy . </S>",
    "<S> an exact diagonalization treatment of disorder @xcite has shown that the bulk intrinsic she is robust against weak disorder . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , several numerical studies utilizing the landauer - buttiker ( lb ) formalism in a tight - binding model representation of the rashba so coupling hamiltonian in the presence of disorder show similar conclusion in the limit which corresponds to the continuum effective mass model ( see below ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we address a key question that has yet to be addressed directly : _ how to measure the intrinsic spin - hall effect through transport measurements ? _ </S>",
    "<S> all previous numerical studies have focused on the controversy regarding the robustness of the effect against disorder and how disorder , rashba coupling strength , etc . , </S>",
    "<S> change the continuum effective mass model value of @xmath0 in the various models . </S>",
    "<S> recently a new theoretical question has arisen , whether the dissipationless currents or spin background currents can lead to spin accumulation or to a steady signal which can manifest such an effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this question can be addressed unambiguously in the mesoscopic regime where the effect of the leads and disorder can be taken into account through the explicit treatment of voltage and current probes within the lb formalism @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a current is driven from lead 2 to 1 in the lower leg shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) and the rest of the contacts are voltage probes , i.e. , leads with total zero current . </S>",
    "<S> then , for typical current utilized in experiments and typical parameters we find a voltage difference @xmath1 dependent on the rashba coupling and coupled to the spin - hall conductance defined at , e.g. , probe 6 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of this voltage , relative to the residual voltage obtained at zero rashba coupling , is of the order @xmath2 for the maximum system sizes that we can model ( @xmath3 m ) .        in the mesoscopic regime , </S>",
    "<S> several of the controversies that have arisen from the study of the bulk spin - transport coefficients can be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> within this regime the only assumption made in describing the transport through the sample via the current and voltage probes , other than the applicability of the tight - binding approximation for the so coupled electronic structure , is that such contacts are perfectly metallic , i.e. , an exact analytical expression is known for their green s functions .    </S>",
    "<S> several numerical studies have addressed the robustness of the intrinsic spin - hall effect within the mesoscopic regime utilizing the lb formalism in a tight - binding model representation of the rashba so coupled hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> xie _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. @xcite obtained the expected universal spin - hall conductance in the weak disorder limit with the fermi energy , @xmath4 , at the band center @xmath5 , but observed that spin - hall conductance decreased rapidly with system size due to localization effects . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in direct contradiction to the general notion that the so coupled 2dess exhibit a delocalized region @xcite and , perhaps more importantly , that at the band center of this model any hall coefficient vanishes due to electron - hole symmetry @xcite . perhaps the most compendious of these tight - binding model numerical studies are refs . and where the expected symmetry of the hall conductance with respect to @xmath4 and the expected metal - insulator transition as a function of so coupling and disorder strength @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ model hamiltonian and lb treatment of the spin - hall effect_. the experimental detection of the she through electrical means is conceptually challenging . </S>",
    "<S> given the controversy surrounding the nature of the spin - currents generated by electric fields , a measurement of the voltage between two metallic contacts @xcite appears to be the most promising dc - transport approach to unambiguously determine the presence of the she signal . </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention then in the proposed h - shape device shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the first term represents a quenched disorder potential and disorder is introduced by randomly selecting the on - site energy @xmath13 in the range [ -w/2,w/2 ] . within the leads the so coupling is zero and therefore each lead should be considered as having two independent spin - channels . </S>",
    "<S> these leads constitute reservoirs of electrons at chemical potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of leads which we consider to be either four ( lead 1 - 4 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> all the voltages are obtained by imposing the boundary conditions @xmath37 for i=3 through 6 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the arbitrary zero of voltage is fixed by setting @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these are later translated to a realistic voltages by setting the current to a typical value of @xmath41 na .    </S>",
    "<S> _ results and discussion . _ in order to address the key issue of how the spin - hall effect can manifest itself through a dc - transport measurement without ferromagnetic contacts we choose realistic parameters for our calculations which model currently available systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an effective mass of @xmath42 and a disorder strength of @xmath43 mev corresponding to the mobility of 250,000 @xmath44/vs , which is typical for a semiconductor like ( in , ga)as . </S>",
    "<S> we take the rashba parameter @xmath45 in the range from 0 to 80 mev  nm which are easily obtained in experiments @xcite , and we choose the electron concentration of approximately @xmath46 @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi energy is obtained from the chosen electron concentration assuming an infinite 2des . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a small difference of a few percent when considering our finite tight - binding model but the leads themselves are the ones providing the reservoir of electrons and therefore such fluctuations are small as verified by direct numerical calculations ( not shown ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.2 we show the spin hall conductance @xmath48 as a function of rashba parameter for the h - shape structure when current flows through the bottom leg as indicated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we consider the system with 6 leads and with leg lengths l varying from 90 to 140 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the total size of the system is @xmath34 in the @xmath49-direction and @xmath50 in the @xmath51-direction . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal connection bar is @xmath52 by @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the legs is @xmath52 with the attached leads of the same width . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios were chosen for typical fabricated samples ( of larger system size ) but any shape is feasible to do and a search for an optimal geometry is underway @xcite .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 and flowing current of 10na in the bottom leg.,width=321 ]    this particular h - shape structure allows for minimalization of the residual voltage drop due to charge flow which is of the order of few hundreds of nanovolts . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 is calculated accordingly to eq .   </S>",
    "<S> [ gspin ] . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are conducted for a few different meshes @xmath54 to check the convergence of results for @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath48 is around 0.2 - 0.6 in @xmath56 units for rashba coupling 70 - 80 mev  nm and @xmath57 nm . we also note that within these parameters we are well within the metallic regime @xcite and both spin - split subbands are occupied </S>",
    "<S> .    the spin hall conductance can not be measured by the paramagnetic leads and ferromagnetic leads can introduce spurious effects coming from the impedance mistmatch preventing ballistic contacts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that the spin current which flows between leads 5 and 6 can generate a secondary effect , the induction of a voltage difference in the top leg between leads 3 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in the same spirit as the initially proposed set - up by hirsch @xcite but in a far simpler configuration without the need of considering a bridged conductor nor any unknown scattering mechanisms other than the effects of disorder which is actually small in this case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this in fig . 3 where we show the nonzero voltage difference @xmath58 as a function of rashba coupling for different size systems , different meshes and with and without </S>",
    "<S> the additional leads 5 and 6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the increase of @xmath59 with the increase of rashba coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the induced voltage variation is of the order of few @xmath60v for @xmath61 mev  nm and can be easily measured . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the inclusion or omissions of leads 5 and 6 which in reality can not measure directly the spin hall conductance and do not influence the voltage difference ; they do however influence the total residual voltage background @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the results as a function of mesh size is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 which show the results for the larger meshes calculated .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that at such disorder strength the results do not depend on the disorder strength if we , say , double it . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates two important facts : one , that the voltage induced is originating from an intrinsic effect , and two , that the effect is not related to the constant in - plane polarization induced by a current in a 2des with rashba coupling , the levitov effect @xcite , since this effect is proportional to the mobility .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have calculated , as a function of the rashba so coupling strength @xmath45 , the voltage drop @xmath63 that occurs in an h - shape sample in a response to a driving dc - current between leads 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage difference closely follows the changes of the calculated she conductance , @xmath48 , with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath63 increases with the increase of rashba coupling for constant disorder strength @xmath64 which is a clear evidence that the observed voltage signal is directly connected with the intrinsic she . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides another confirmation of the robustness of the intrinsic she against weak disorder and shows the feasibility of detecting she signals through dc - transport measurements in structures with realistic experimental parameters . </S>"
