    "hd56126 ( iras07134 + 1005 ) is in the post - agb stage ( also referred to as the pre - planetary nebulae stage ) of stellar evolution .",
    "this is the relative short transition stage from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) to the white dwarf ( wd ) phase ( iben  @xcite ) .",
    "low - mass stars ( 0.8 m@xmath28 m@xmath29 8.0 m@xmath27 ) may experience up to three dredge - up episodes .",
    "the first occurs on the red giant branch ( rgb ) . the second on the early - agb ( e - agb )",
    "is limited to stars with initial masses in the range of 4 to 8  m@xmath27 .",
    "the third occurs on the thermal pulsating - agb ( tp - agb ) .",
    "the last dredge - up changes the surface abundances of the star most drastically : most noticeable the carbon and s - process elements abundances enhanced ( forestini & charbonnel  @xcite ) .",
    "several studies of the photospheric abundance of post - agb stars have indeed shown that some of these stars are carbon rich and have enhanced abundances of s - process elements ( luck & bond  @xcite ; klochkova  @xcite ; van winckel  @xcite ; reddy et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ; decin et al .",
    "since agb stars lose mass through a dense stellar wind , post - agb stars are surrounded by a shell of material which expands at typically 3 to 30  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this material constitutes the circumstellar environment ( cse ) of the star .",
    "the cse material mixes with interstellar clouds and forms the parent material for the next generation of stars . in this manner ,",
    "nucleosynthesis products are used to build new stars and the galaxy is enriched with heavy elements ( elements more massive than helium ) .",
    "the study of the chemical structure of the cse of evolved stars is therefore of importance to understand the chemical enrichment of the universe .",
    "stellar evolution theory needs constraints from observations .",
    "the @xmath0c/@xmath1c suits this goal very well since during the agb evolution @xmath0c is formed in the helium burning layer , while @xmath1c is formed as a by - product in the hydrogen burning layer . the observed ratio of these two isotopes depends on the efficiency and the relative strength of these two layers , and on the efficiency of the dredge - up processes .",
    "theoretical models of the chemical structure of the cse of highly evolved stars have mainly concentrated on understanding the well - studied , and well - observed carbon star irc+10216 ( for references see olofsson @xcite ) .",
    "when a star reaches the tip of the agb , the mass - loss rate has its maximum strength and drops several orders of magnitude after the star leaves the agb .",
    "material ejected during the agb phase slowly expands from the star and leaves a cavity in the cse which will grow with time . eventually leading to a cavity the size of a planetary nebulae .",
    "the elemental composition of the cse is fixed after the material leaves the surface of the star .",
    "in contrast , the molecular composition of the cse is constantly changing under the influence of the stellar and interstellar radiation fields : molecules are destroyed and formed continuously .",
    "most studies of the cse make use of molecular line emission in the sub - millimeter and radio ( e.g. co and hcn ) while recently the iso satellite has allowed a study of molecular lines in the infrared .",
    "emission lines of spatially unresolved sources provide no positional information , and only partial velocity information ( the radial component ) .",
    "this is obviously not the case for absorption lines since they are formed in a pencil - beam towards the continuum source and probe therefore a well defined region of the cse .",
    "secondly , a molecular absorption line spectrum has many lines allowing a study of the population of the energy levels of the molecules and processes like optical pumping .",
    "absorption lines therefore yield information additional to that already available from emission line studies . as part of an ongoing effort to study the characteristics of post - agb stars ,",
    "we have been studying circumstellar @xmath0c@xmath6n and @xmath0c@xmath5 lines in the optical spectra of post - agb stars ( referred to as c2cn stars ) which show the unidentified 21  @xmath30 m feature ( kwok et al .",

    "we found a ratio of @xmath31 but argued that the true c/@xmath1c ratio is likely closer to @xmath32 owing to the isotopic exchange reaction ( @xmath33 ) . in this paper ( iv )",
    "we present measurements of the c@xmath5/c@xmath1c ratio .",
    "combining these two independent isotope ratios allows us to constrain the isotope exchange reaction and give a more accurate determination of the true c/@xmath1c ratio in the cse surrounding hd56126 .    in sec .  2 we discuss the optical and infrared observations and the source of the data on the equivalent widths used in our analysis",

    "the equality of @xmath78 for the various species suggests that their regions of residence overlap considerably .      in order to derive the column density from the equivalent width of a line ,",

    "the derived cn curve of growth is well definied . particularly worthy to note",
    "is the fact that the line sample for almost every rotational level spans almost the entire range of equivalent width from weak unsaturated lines to saturated lines on the shoulder of the curve of growth .",
    "thanks to this circumstance , the derivation of the @xmath49-parameter and the rotational populations are effectively independent and lead to accurate results .",
    "furthermore , the weak @xmath1cn lines may be compared with rather similar weak cn lines of the same rotational levels such that the cn/@xmath1cn ratio is independent of the derived @xmath49-parameter .",

    "the c@xmath5 phillips system 1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , 3 - 0 , and 4 - 0 bands do not provide such a happy selection of lines .",
    "lines from the four bands from a given lower ( @xmath44 ) level do not span a large range in equivalent widths .",
    "the line selection does not run from weak to saturated lines .",
    "this necessarity means that the @xmath49-parameter can not be determined independently of the rotational population .",
    "it should also be noted that , except for limited measurements of the c@xmath5 1 - 0 lines , the equivalent widths comes from wht spectra .",
    "comparision for cn lines show that the mcdonald spectra provide more accurate equivalent widths then those from the available wht spectra .    in light of these limitations",
    ", we elected to assume that the appropriate @xmath49-parameter for c@xmath5 was the well - determined value found for cn .",
    "curves of growth for the individual c@xmath5 bands are shows in fig .",
    "[ fig_cofg ] where the column densities are defined using all available lines .",
    "this shows clearly that the observed curve of growths of the bands needs to be shifted systematically relative to the theoretical curves . as noted above ,",
    "this inconsistency between observed and theoretical curves of growth was not found for the cn red system bands .    several potential explanations for this problem affecting the c@xmath5 curves of growth have been considered .",
    "could the relative @xmath79-values be at fault ?",
    "if the @xmath79-values are considered as the adjustable parameter , the necessary adjustments corresponds to multiplicative factors of 0.62 , 0.98 , 1.53 , and 2.26 for the 1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , 3 - 0 , and 4 - 0 bands respectively . recall that the adopted theoretical @xmath79-values have been estimated to be accurate to about 5  % .",
    "it is instructive to compare relative @xmath79-values : the requirement that lines from the four bands be forced to fit a single curve of growth requires ratios of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast , the theoretical estimates of the same ratios are 0.61 and 0.28 from langhoff et al . with very similar ratios from other theoretical calculations ; for example , van dishoeck s ( @xcite ) @xmath79-values correspond to the ratios 0.59 and 0.27 .",
    "earlier calculations by theodorakopoulos et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calculations give the ratios of 0.64 and 0.31 . in general ,",
    "absolute values of the @xmath79-values are more sensitive to the details of a calculation than are ratios of the @xmath79-values that depend primarily on the well determined potential energy curves and secondarily on the variations of the electronic transition moment with inter - nuclear separation . in other words , it is not surprising that theodorakopoulos et al.s @xmath79-values for the 2 - 0 band is 29  % larger than langhoff et al.s but that the above sets of @xmath79-values ratios from the same pair of calculations are identical to within 5 - 10  % .",
    "it is worth noting too that observations of interstellar c@xmath5 lines toward @xmath83 oph . give the ratio @xmath84 ( van dishoeck & black @xcite ) in good agreement with the predictions from langhoff et al .",
    "of 2.15 , and in sharp disagreement with the ratio of 1.4 from fitting hd56126 s lines to a single curve of growth .",
    "our assessment of the theoretical @xmath79-values for the phillips system is that their uncertainties do _ not _ allow curves of growth for the individual bands to be shifted as here required",
    ".    could emission affect the equivalent widths ?",
    "if unresolved emission from the circumstellar shell fills in the absorption provided by c@xmath5 molecules along the line of sight to the star , the theoretical curves of growth for a uniform slab will be inappropriate .",
    "if the emission contribution declines in the order 1 - 0 , 2 - 0 , 3 - 0 , and 4 - 0 , the apparent inconsistencies in the column densities could be explained .",
    "it is certainly the case that , if the circumstellar shell is spherically symmetric and large with respect to the star , one expects a p - cygni profile with blue - shifted absorption and emission to the red of the absorption .",
    "( reddy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) observed that the circumstellar c@xmath5 phillips lines of the post - agb star iras07431 + 1115 exhibit p - cygni profiles while cohen & kuhi ( @xcite ) found that the absorption component of c@xmath5 towards the egg nebulae was present in the polarized light ( reflected by the nebulae ) , while the emission component was unpolarized . )",
    "since the expansion velocity is 8.0  km  s@xmath8 , the emission and absorption would be fully resolved at our resolution such that dilution of the absorption should be very small .",
    "such emission is not seen in our spectra .",
    "we conclude that the shell does not meet the conditions of large and/or spherically symmetric .",
    "a special geometry must be provided such that emission from regions off the line of sight to the star provide sufficient flux to fill in the lines with the additional proviso that emission not dominate entirely .",
    "transition probabilities of phillips system bands do suggest that emission might account for the apparent inconsistencies in the column densities . branching ratios , @xmath85 , for emission from the levels @xmath86 of the upper state",
    "may be calculated from transition probabilities , a@xmath87 , given by van dishoeck ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that @xmath88  % , that is 82  % of the radiative decays from @xmath89 are in the 1 - 0 band .",
    "for the other observed bands , @xmath90  % , @xmath91  % , and @xmath92  % .",
    "emission rates of these bands depend also on the pumping rates from @xmath93 in the x@xmath94 state .",
    "these rates should be fairly similar to @xmath95 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "then , it is apparent that contamination of the absorption lines by emission should be most serious for the 1 - 0 band and least for the 4 - 0 band .",
    "this is in the correct sense to account for the apparent inconsistencies in the column densities .",
    "it follows that , if this is the correct explanation that c@xmath5 bands should also be seen in emission .",
    "for example , the 3 - 1 band is expected to have twice the emission strength of the 3 - 0 band .",
    "we looked for emission of the 3 - 1 band in the available spectra which cover this region , no such emission ( nor absorption ) was found to be present .",
    "a simpler and stronger argument against the `` emission '' hypothesis is that no such effects are seen in the cn red system lines where the run of @xmath85 from 73  % to 7  % for 1 - 0 to 4 - 0 is similar to the run for the phillips bands .",
    "could the cn @xmath49-parameter be inappropriate for c@xmath5 ?",
    "the cn @xmath49-parameter is dominated by contributions from small scale turbulence or a velocity gradient .",
    "since cn and c@xmath5 seem likely to reside in similar layers of the shell , it seemed reasonable to suppose that the molecules have the same @xmath49-parameter .",
    "it is , however , the case that a lower value , @xmath96  km  s@xmath8 put all lines on a single curve of growth whith adoption of the theoretical @xmath79-values .",
    "we can not reject this lower @xmath49-parameter directly but note ( see below ) that it gives an unusually high isotopic ratio of c/@xmath1c@xmath97 .",
    "could the equivalent widths be in error ?",
    "a noticeable difference between the cn and c@xmath5 curves of growth is the larger scatter of the latter about the fitted theoretical curve of growth .",
    "we suspect that this reflects the fact that the cn equivalent widths are measured of higher resolution and higher signal - to - nose ratio spectra .",
    "then the vast majority of the c@xmath5 lines , in particular , the c@xmath5 1 - 0 lines are in a ratter noisy region of the available spectra .",
    "quite possibly , the c@xmath5 lines are subject to systematic errors .",
    "one contributing factor may be that the wings of the strongest lines make a significant contribution of the total equivalent width .",
    "for circumstellar lines ( with a low @xmath49-value ) , the intrinsic spectrum ( as observed at infinite spectral resolution ) reaches zero intensity in the core of the profile .",
    "line wings are very extended ( several times the @xmath37 of the line ) and represent a significant fraction of the column density .",
    "these shallow wings are unfortunately very hard to measure and in most cases we did a gaussian fit on the profile to obtain the equivalent width and assumed that the contribution of the wing is irrelevant .",
    "tests on the difference between a gaussian and voigt profile shows indeed that this could account for a part of the inconsistensies .",
    "the stronger the line , the more our measured equivalent widths are in error .",
    "unfortunately there is no easy way to measure the line wings unless we obtain additional very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra at very high - resolution ( @xmath98 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the inconsistencies in the derived column densities are most likely a result of the fact that we did not take the extended wings of the absorption profiles into account .",
    "hence , for the saturated lines , our measured equivalent widths are too low .    fig .",
    "[ fig_cofg ] shows the curve of growth of c@xmath5 phillips lines towards hd56126 .",
    "the @xmath79-values for the phillips bands have been multiplied by 0.62 1 - 0 , 0.98 2 - 0 , 1.53 3 - 0 , and 2.26 4 - 0 to improve the fit , and the over - plotted curve of growth is for our preferred value of @xmath99  km  s@xmath8 .",

    "we therefore conclude that our analysis is not severely affected , but that an increased accuracy can only be reached by taking the ( presumed ) emission component into account .",

    "the rotational temperature is given by the negative of the inverse of the slope of the line . from previous work ( see for details and references paper i , ii , iii ) we know that c@xmath5 and cn are not in lte , their rotational diagram are not linear . the curvature for c@xmath5 in fig .  [ fig_rot ] suggests that this molecule is not in lte .",
    "for the other molecules , too few @xmath44 levels are probed to make a similar claim .    to quantify the excitation of the molecule",

    "the energy distribution of the central stars , the star s photospheric spectrum , and the reddening between the star and the line forming region should therefore be considered .",
    "clearly , it would be of great interest to model the excitation of the five molecules detected and extract information about the conditions within the cse from their excitation .",
    "because of the difference in rotational temperature between c@xmath5 and c@xmath1c , and the fact that c@xmath1c has twice as many @xmath44 levels available , the c@xmath5/c@xmath1c can not be determined for each @xmath44 level independently . instead the only acceptable way is by integrating the population over all available levels .",
