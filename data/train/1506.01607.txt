    "swift j1753.5 - 0127 was discovered by the _ swift_/burst alert telescope ( bat ) on mjd 53551 ( 2005 june 30 ) @xcite . the @xmath4 kev flux continued to increase until @xmath5 mjd 53560 ( 2005 july 9 ) with a peak flux of @xmath6 mcrab . instead of returning to a quiescent state after outburst , swift",
    "j1753.5 - 0127 has maintained an average flux of @xmath7 mcrab in the @xmath4 kev energy band .",
    "x - ray and gamma - ray observations during the flare showed spectral features and qpo s consistent with a black hole ( bh ) in the low hard state @xcite . consequently , swift j1753.5 - 0127",
    "is considered a black hole candidate ( bhc ) .",
    "radio observations during this time also detected the source as are expected for bh s in the low hard state , but the reported radio fluxes from @xcite and @xcite were significantly lower than is expected from radio / x - ray correlations @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated an orbital period of @xmath8 h based on the period of the observed superhump while @xcite used photometric and spectroscopic spectroscoptic variability to determine an orbital period of @xmath9 h. a companion star has not yet been identified .",
    "the inability to identify it in archival images suggests that the donor star is a low mass star @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the distance to the system to be @xmath10 kpc , which suggests that the donor is a main - sequence type k or m star .",
    "thus , the mass of the compact object is not well constrained .",
    "@xcite estimate a mass @xmath11 for a source distance of 6 kpc while @xcite report the mass as @xmath12 .",
    "most bh(c ) s do not exhibit persistent or quasi - persistent emission .",
    "@xcite list 8 such sources ( bh s : cyg x-1 , lmc x-1 , lmc x-3 , and grs 1915 + 105 ; bhc s : 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , 4u 1755 - 338 , 4u 1957 + 115 , and grs 1758 - 258 ) out of 20 confirmed bh s and 20 bhc s .",
    "of the 8 sources , cyg x-1 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , and grs",
    "1758 - 258 are the only ones to spend most of the time in a hard state , as swift j1753.5 - 0127 has done for most of the @xmath0 years since the flare @xcite .",
    "these three sources have high - energy tails seen above @xmath13 kev .",
    "( @xcite and @xcite for cyg x-1 ; @xcite for 1e 1740.7 - 2942 ; and @xcite for grs 1758 - 258 . ) possible mechanisms for the origin of the hard tails include comptonization of a non - thermal population of electrons @xcite , bulk - comptonization @xcite , and jet emission @xcite . _",
    "integral _ observations of cyg x-1 by @xcite and @xcite have reported highly polarized emission @xmath14 kev .",
    "the strong degree of polarization suggests the hard x - ray emission above @xmath13 kev is related to the radio jet seen from cyg x-1 in the hard state .",
    "even though cyg x-1 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , grs 1758 - 258 , and swift j1753.5 - 0127 spend most of the time in a hard state , the observed behavior of these sources are quite different .",
    "historically , cyg x-1 undergoes transitions to a soft state on the timescale of a few years though since 2011 it has spent long periods in a soft state with short periods in the hard state .",
    "both 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and grs 1758 - 258 are almost always observed to be in a hard state with short periods lasting weeks to a few months in a soft state before returning to a hard state .",
    "swift j1753.5 - 0127 has exhibited extremely different behavior in that it was discovered during an x - ray outburst , but did not fade back into quiescence , instead maintaining a persistent flux and remaining in a hard state for @xmath0 years .    in this paper",
    ", we present analysis of _ integral_/spi observations of swift j1753.5 - 0127 beginning with the target of opportunity ( too ) during the flare in 2005 ( mjd 53592 ) until 2010 march ( mjd 55284 ) after which spi observes the source for only short periods ( less than @xmath15 s ) .",
    "the spi results are compared to previous observations of the flare , other isolated pointed - observations of swift j1753.5 - 0127 by other instruments , and to other transient ( gro j0422 + 32 ) and persistent ( grs 1758 - 258 ) bh(c ) s in the spi bandpass .",
    "these are the first published long - term results for swift j1753.5 - 0127 at hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray energies .",
    "the gamma - ray observatory the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral _ ) was launched on 2002 october 17 into an eccentric orbit with an orbital period of 3 days and an orbital inclination of @xmath16 .",
    "these parameters were selected to minimize the amount of time spent in earth s radiation belt @xcite . the spectrometer _",
    "integral_/spi consists of 19 hexagonal germanium detectors ( ged ) configured in a hexagonal pattern with a tungsten coded mask and an active coincidence shield of 91 bismuth germinate ( bgo ) crystals to reduce the background rate @xcite .",
    "the geometrical area of the ged detectors is @xmath17 .",
    "an individual ged is 3.2 cm in length and 69.42 mm in height .",
    "the detectors are actively cooled to @xmath18 k resulting in an energy resolution of @xmath19 kev over the @xmath20 energy range of the instrument @xcite .    in order to be able to generate images of the sky ,",
    "_ integral _ follows a dithering pattern with @xmath21 off - axis pointings from the object of interest .",
    "each pointing lasts from @xmath22 hour such that a complete dithering pattern is completed during an observation period .",
    "the standard dithering pattern is a rectangular pattern with 1 on - axis pointing for the source of interest and 24 off - axis pointings .",
    "there is a secondary dithering pattern which is hexagonal with 1 on - axis pointing and 6 off - axis pointings @xcite .",
    "the only dedicated observation of swift j1753.5 - 0127 by _ integral _ ( as of revolution 1373 ) was as a too during its flare in 2005 , but because of its proximity to the galactic plane , the source has been observed often during the mission . since swift j1753.5 - 0127 was discovered ,",
    "it has been observed within @xmath23 of the detector normal in at least one pointing ( @xmath24 s ) in 149 _ integral _ revolutions . for this work , only those revolutions with at least 10 pointings including swift j1753.5 - 0127 within @xmath23 of the spi pointing direction were analyzed using the spi data analysis interface ( spidai ) resulting a total exposure time of 2.55 ms over 53 revolutions .",
    "the flux extraction procedure in spidai performs a model fit for each energy band convolving a sky model of those sources within the field of view and a background model ( based on empty field observations ) with the instrument response function which is then compared to the ged count rates in the detector plane .",
    "( see @xcite for more detail . ) for spectral analysis , spi data spanning @xmath25 kev were grouped into 50 logarithmically - spaced , energy bins .",
    "the first two energy channels were ignored in spectral fitting because of uncertainties in the energy response @xcite thus reducing the energy range to @xmath26 kev .",
    "spi observations from 13 revolutions before the flare covering mjd @xmath27 measured an average flux of @xmath28 mcrab in the @xmath29 kev energy band at the location of swift j1753.5 - 0127 . after correcting for",
    "the positive 1 mcrab ( @xmath30 ct / s ) bias , the _ rxte_/all - sky monitor ( asm ) measured an average flux of @xmath31 mcrab in the @xmath32 kev band over the period of @xmath33 ( source discovered on mjd 53520 ) resulting in a significance of only @xmath34 and is thus not statistically significant .",

    "the source flux then decays exponentially with a time constant of @xmath42 days in the bat data and @xmath43 days in the asm data .",
    "it is during this decay that the _ integral _ too is performed , spanning mjd @xmath44 ( 2005 august @xmath45 ) .",
    "the flux continues to decline until @xmath5 mjd 53700 ( 2005 november 26 ) with a flux of @xmath46 mcrab in the bat data and @xmath38 mcrab in the asm data .",

    "after this period , the swift j1753.5 - 0127 lightcurve exhibits larger temporal variability in both the bat and asm energy ranges .",
    "the first spi observations after the flux increase are not until approximately mjd 54900 ( 2009 march 10 ) when swift j1753.5 - 0127 was observed in four revolutions over the span of @xmath50 days .    from about mjd @xmath51 ( 2009 june to 2010 october ) , the source enters what @xcite refers to as a `` failed transition '' where the spectral features soften , but the source does not make a transition to a high soft state .",

    "this point corresponds to revolution 848 in the spi data , and the asm flux is based on a single measurement with a 90 s exposure .",

    "the source remained in a persistent , low - hard flux state for a majority of the spi observations , undergoing a `` failed transition '' @xcite beginning in 2009 june ( @xmath5 mjd 54983 ) .",
    "analysis of spi data for 53 _ integral _ revolutions when combined with _",
    "rxte_/asm data revealed three distinct flux regions after the initial outburst . for each region ,",
    "the summed spectrum was fit to a powerlaw model and a cutoff powerlaw model over the @xmath26 kev energy range .",
    "region ( when both spi and asm fluxes were low ) was well fit by a cutoff powerlaw model with a spectral index of 1.45 and a cutoff energy of 265 kev .",
    "region ( when the spi flux was low and the asm flux was high ) was well fit by a powerlaw model with a spectral index of 2.08 .",
    "region ( when the spi flux was roughly constant and the asm flux varied by @xmath142 ) was well fit by a cutoff powerlaw model with a spectral index of 1.40 and a cutoff energy of 125 kev when excluding the too observation from the fit .",
    "when the too was fit alone with a cutoff powerlaw model , the best - fit parameters were a spectral index of 1.41 and a cutoff energy of 213 kev .",
    "the data that were well - fit by a cutoff powerlaw were then combined for an average cutoff powerlaw spectrum with parameters @xmath143 kev and having a weak excess ( @xmath144 ) from @xmath145 kev .",
    "this spectrum was better fit by a comptt + powerlaw model than a cutoff powerlaw + powerlaw model , resulting in best - fit parameters @xmath146 .    in conclusion ,",
    "swift j1753.5 - 0127 presents the unusual case of a bhc initially behaving like a typical x - ray nova until failing to fade into quiescence .",
    "the source showed some temporal similarities to gro j0422 + 32 during the flare with a fast rise time with an slow decay as well as some spectral similarities as the electron temperatures and optical depths of both sources are similar .",
    "the continued emission for swift j1753.5 - 0127 while in a hard spectral state puts the source in a small group of bh(c ) s consisting of cyg x-1 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , and grs 1758 - 258 .",
    "these four sources have ( quasi-)persistent emission and remain in a hard state most of the time . above @xmath13 kev ,",
    "the spectra of cyg x-1 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , and grs 1758 - 258 show an additional spectral component .",
    "swift j1753.5 - 0127 shows a weak excess above @xmath13 kev but is not as bright as cyg x-1 and lacks the exposure time of 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and grs 1758 - 258 ( @xmath147 ms of _ integral _ observations ) .    for cyg x-1",
    ", polarization measurements suggest that the hard tail is associated with a jet . as cyg x-1 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , and grs 1758 - 258 are all microquasars @xcite , the hard tails for 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and grs 1758 - 258",
    "could also be related to jets .",
    "interestingly , @xcite report 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , grs 1758 - 258 , and swift j1753.5 - 0127 as having a similar radio / x - ray relationship ( with cyg x-1 not reported ) . assuming the persistent emission continues , swift j1753.5 - 0.127 , as well as 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and grs 1758 - 258 , are a candidates to look for polarization above the thermal comptonization component with a future mission that has higher polarization sensitivity .",
