    "no evidence for lq production is seen , and limits are set on the lq coupling @xmath9 as a function of the lq mass .",
    "a total of 14 lq models are investigated @xcite .",
    "two lqs , namely the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 are of special interest , because these can be interpreted as a squark produced via @xmath2-parity ( @xmath12 ) violating coupling @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the correspondence of lq type and susy particle is indicated in table  [ table : zeuslqci ] .",
    "limits on lq production at @xmath14 confidence level , determined from the complete h1 data are shown in figure [ figure : h1lqlimits ] .",
