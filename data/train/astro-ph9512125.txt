    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are most likely generated during deceleration of ultra - relativistic particles . a cosmological compact source that emits the energy required for",
    "a grb can not generate the observed non thermal burst .",
    "instead it will create an opaque fireball ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if even a small amount of baryonic matter is present then the ultimate result of this fireball will be a shell of ultra - relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy can be recovered as radiation only if these particles are decelerated by the ism @xcite or by internal shocks @xcite .",
    "we show that a careful analysis of the interaction between the ultra - relativistic particles and the ism changes some of the previous results and sheds a new light on the expected temporal structure in grbs .",
    "consider a slab of ultra - relativistic cold dense matter with a lorentz factor @xmath1 that hits a stationary cold interstellar medium - the ism .",
    "two shocks form : a reverse shock that propagates into the dense relativistic shell , reducing its speed and increasing its internal energy , and a forward shock that propagates into the ism giving it relativistic velocities and internal energy .",
    "a contact discontinuity separates the shocked shell material and the shocked ism .",
    "there are two limits @xcite in which the reverse shock is either newtonian or ultra - relativistic ( the forward shock is always ultra - relativistic in our case ) .",
    "we define @xmath2 as the density ratio of the ultra - relativistic shell and the ism . if @xmath3 the reverse shock is ultra - relativistic . in this case : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lorentz factors of the shocked material ( shocked material on both sides of the contact discontinuity move at the same velocity ) relative to an observer at infinity , @xmath6 is the width of the ultra - relativistic shell and @xmath7 is the time that the reverse shock crosses the shell . since @xmath8 ,",
    "almost all of the initial kinetic energy is converted by the shocks into internal energy .",
    "therefore the process is over after a single passage of the reverse shock through the shell , and the relevant time scale for energy extraction is the shell crossing time , @xmath7 . along the contact discontinuity",
    "the energy densities are equal and since both shocked regions have comparable width they release comparable amounts of energy . the ism mass swept by the forward shock at the time that the reverse shock crosses",
    "the shell is @xmath9 of the shell s mass .",
    "this is larger than the simple estimate given by msaros , & rees @xcite of @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 the reverse shock is newtonian and : @xmath12 since now @xmath13 the reverse shock converts only a small fraction , @xmath14 , of the kinetic energy into internal energy and @xmath7 is no longer the relevant time scale for energy extraction .",
    "the main deceleration is during a quasi - steady state in which the shell decelerates continuously without shocks .",
    "the slowing down time can be estimated by @xmath15 . during this time",
    "the forward shock collects a fraction @xmath10 of the shell s rest mass , which is the same as the original estimate of msaros & rees @xcite . in contrary to the relativistic case , there are two time scales now : the shock crossing time , @xmath7 , and the total slowing down time , @xmath16 .    in the realistic situation",
    "the ism density is probably inhomogeneous .",
    "consider a density jump by a factor @xmath17 over a distance @xmath18 .",
    "the forward shock propagates into the ism with a density @xmath19 as before and when it reaches the position where the ism density is @xmath20 a new shock wave is reflected .",
    "this shock is reflected again of the shell .",
    "similar analysis shows that the reflections time is @xmath21 .    finally , we mention the possibility of internal shocks inside the shell @xcite .",
    "these may form when faster material overtakes slower material . if the lorentz factor varies by a factor of @xmath22 over a length scale @xmath23 then the time for these shock to from",
    "is @xmath24 .",
    "this time scale is shorter than the slowing - down time scale and therefore internal shocks appear before considerable deceleration in the newtonian case . in the relativistic case",
    "considerable deceleration occurs before internal shocks unless @xmath25 .",
    "in a spherical system the density ratio @xmath26 decreases with time . initially @xmath27 and the reverse shock is newtonian .",
    "the energy conversion depends critically on the question whether this shock become relativistic before the kinetic energy is extracted from the shell .",
    "this depends , in turn , on the ratio of two radii : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the reverse shock becomes relativistic and @xmath30 where the reserve shock crosses the shell .",
    "the radius @xmath31 in these expressions is the sedov length which is familiar from snr theory .",
    "two other important radii are : @xmath32 where the forward shock sweeps a mass @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the shell s rest mass ) and @xmath35 where the shell begins to spread if the initial lorentz factor varies by order @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath36 is also an upper limit for the the location of internal shocks since @xmath37 .",
    "conveniently , the four critical radii are related by one dimensionless quantity :    @xmath38    two possibilities exist :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath39 - the newtonian case : @xmath40 and shock reaches the inner edge of the shell while it is still newtonian .",
    "most of the energy is extracted during a steady state deceleration phase within the radius @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath36 is smaller than all other radii spreading might be important .",
    "if the shell is spreading then @xmath6 in the above expressions should be replaced by @xmath42 .",
    "this delays the time at which the reverse shock reaches the shell and decreases the shell s density .",
    "these effects lead to a triple coincidence : @xmath43 with @xmath44 and a mildly relativistic reverse shock during the period of effective energy extraction . without spreading only a small fraction of the total energy",
    "is converted to thermal energy in the reverse shock . with spreading",
    "both shocks convert comparable amounts of energy .",
    "@xmath45 - the relativistic case : @xmath46 .",
    "the reverse shock becomes relativistic before it crosses the shell .",
    "only a small fraction of the energy is converted at @xmath47 and the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy only at @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath36 is larger than all other radii and spreading is unimportant .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this limit @xmath49 is independent of the initial lorentz factor @xmath50 and it is only weakly dependent on other parameters .",
    "this might have an important role in the fact that the observed radiation always appears as low energy @xmath50-rays .",
    "neither the internal shocks nor the ism inhomogeneity time scales are affected by these spherical considerations .",
    "the former depends only upon @xmath51 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 and the latter depends only on @xmath18 and @xmath0 .",
    "both are constant throughout the spherical expansions .",
    "we examine now the possible relation between the observed time scales and the hydrodynamic time scales .",
    "we assume that the shocked material emits the radiation on a time scale shorter than the hydrodynamic time scales .",
    "a simple estimate of synchrotron cooling rate ( assuming equipartition of the magnetic field energy ) is consistent with this assumption .",
    "the requirement that the cooling time is shorter than the observed variability imposes interesting constraints on the physical conditions within the shocks . in particular it demands that the turbulent magnetic field within the shocked material should be very close to equipartition with the thermal energy there .",
    "we discuss these conditions elsewhere @xcite .",
    "while the value of @xmath52 cm is known ( using @xmath53ergs and @xmath54particle/@xmath55 ) , the values of @xmath56 and @xmath50 are more ambiguous . using the canonical values @xcite @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "cm we get @xmath59 , corresponding to a newtonian reverse shock .",
    "nevertheless a value of @xmath60 is also possible with reasonable parameters ( for example @xmath61 cm and @xmath62 ) .",
    "therefore , both relativistic and newtonian reverse shock are possible .",
    "the bursts duration is determined by the slowing down time of the shell divided by @xmath63 .",
    "thus , given a typical radius of energy conversion , @xmath64 the observed time scale is : @xmath65 @xmath66 ranges from @xmath67msec , for @xmath68 cm and @xmath62 , to @xmath69sec for @xmath70 and @xmath71 cm ( see fig .",
    "the observed durations of the brightest 30 bursts limit @xmath50 to @xmath72 with a typical value of @xmath73 and it limits @xmath6 to @xmath74 cm .",
    "a possible source of the observed fluctuations during the bursts is inhomogeneity in the ism .",
    "if the length scale of the inhomogeneity is @xmath18 and the density varies by one order of magnitude then the time scale for the observed variability will be : @xmath75 clearly , @xmath76 can be sufficiently short if @xmath18 is sufficiently small .",
    "precursors which appear in about 3% of the bursts might be explained by internal shocks that take place at @xmath77 while the main burst originates from the interaction with the ism .",
    "the duration of the precursor is @xmath78 , which requires values of @xmath56 as high as @xmath79 cm to produce the observed precursors of @xmath80 . if @xmath81 the main bursts will have a duration @xmath82",
    "this will also be the typical separation @xmath83 between the precursor and the main burst .",
    "we expect a time delay between the precursor and the main burst which will be comparable to the duration of the main burst .",
    "note that a correlation of the form @xmath84 exists ( but was not reported ) in the data of koshut _ et .",
    "al . , _ @xcite .",
    "if @xmath85 then precursors do not occur ( unless @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the lack of observed precursors in short bursts .",
    "we have calculated the hydrodynamic time scales of shocks during the interaction between an ultra - relativistic shell and the ism .",
    "we find that with reasonable astrophysical parameters these time scales are in a good agreement with the observed time scales in grbs .",
    "our analysis shows that there are two kinds of shocks : newtonian and relativistic .",
    "the difference between them might correspond to the observed bimodality of short and long bursts . finally , we suggest that precursors might be emitted due to internal shocks within the ultra - relativistic shell while the main burst emerges later from the interaction with the ism .",
