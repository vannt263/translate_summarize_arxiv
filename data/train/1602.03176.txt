    "observations in cosmology have recently led to confirmation that the universe is undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion at present @xcite . the direct support for the phenomenon came from the observations of supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) observation1 .",
    "the explosions of these sne ia look fainter than expected in the einstein de - sitter model .",
    "the concept of `` _ _ dark energy _ _ '' was introduced to explain the luminosity - redshift observations of these type ia supernovae by modifying the right hand side of einstein field equations which give rise to an accelerated expansion of the universe and thus explains the unexpected faintness of the supernovae .",
    "the weird form of energy yet remains to be mysterious as there is no direct observational test to probe it but this is generally assumed that it has a large negative pressure @xcite .    in past few years there have been a number of activities for modelling dark energy including the models with the scalar field and brane world etc . to this effect , a large varieties of scalar field models are discussed in the literature including quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , spintessence spint , tachyon @xcite , quintom @xcite , chameleon @xcite and many more .",
    "these models of scalar field give the equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observational data also allows models of dark energy with equation of state parameter crossing @xmath4 line ( called phantom field models ) .",
    "thus , a number of phantom models have been discussed in the literature@xcite , for instance , brane world and non - minimally coupled scalar field models can give phantom energy @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to introduce the phantom effect is provided by a scalar field with negative kinetic energy term which could be motivated from s - brane constructs in string theory @xcite .",
    "the concept of phantom field was first used in steady state theory of hoyle and subsequently incorporated in hoyle and narlikar theory of gravitation @xcite .    the future singularity termed as `` big rip '' @xcite naturally arises in models with @xmath5 and is characterized by the divergence of the scale factor after a finite interval of time .",
    "it is generic to keep @xmath6 as time dependent rather than to consider it as a constant .",
    "this choice of @xmath6 generates specific scalar field models to avoid the cosmic doomsday @xcite which requires a particular class of phantom field potentials .",
    "there are alternative ways to explain the accelerated expansion by modifying the left hand side of einstein field equations _ a la _ modified theories of gravity . following this , a special class of dark energy model based on the large scale modification of gravity called _ galileon gravity _",
    "@xcite was proposed .",
    "the distinguished feature of this theory is that it provides a consistent modification of general relativity leaving the local physics intact .",
    "this modified gravity in this scheme can give rise to the observed late time cosmic acceleration and also it is free from negative energy instabilities .",
    "the galileon field has five field lagrangians @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath9 is linear , @xmath10 is the standard kinetic term and @xmath11 represents the vainshtein term consisting of three galileon fields that is related to the decoupling limit of dvali , gabadadze , and porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite while @xmath12 and @xmath13 consists of higher order non - linear derivative terms of field . in case , we study scalar field with linear potential , it becomes obligatory to compliment it by the higher derivative galileon terms in the lagrangian . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider the lowest galileon term @xmath11 for phantom and non - phantom fields with linear potential . on purely phenomenological grounds",
    ", we also examine the phantom case with a general potential term @xmath14 @xcite complimented by galileon term . in this case",
    ", we focus on some general features of cosmological dynamics , in particular , current acceleration and future evolution of the universe .",
    "recently , it was found that in quintessence models where scalar field potentials turn negative might lead to collapse of the universe in distant future @xcite dubbed big crunch singularity .",
    "lykkas and perivolaropoulos show that the cosmic doomsday singularity can be avoided in scalar - tensor quintessence with a linear potential by some values of the non - minimal coupling parameter @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall examine these and other aforesaid issues in presence of galileon correction @xmath15 in the lagrangian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider galileon field model with linear potential which is generically non - minimally coupled scalar field model and investigates present and future evolution of the universe for both phantom and non - phantom cases . in section iii , we consider galileon phantom field model with steep exponential potential and examine the future evolution of the universe . we summarize our results in the section iv .",
    "in this section , we consider galileon field action possessing up to the third order term in the lagrangian with a field potential @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 + s_{m } \\label{eq : action}\\]]where , @xmath17 = -1 and + 1 , for phantom and non - phantom galileon fields respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the reduced plank mass and the constant @xmath19 is dimensionless .",
    "@xmath20 entitles the matter action and @xmath21 is a constant of mass dimension one . for simplicity",
    ", we fix here @xmath22 . in a homogeneous isotropic flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe ,",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by varying the action ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to metric tensor @xmath23 and scalar field",
    "@xmath24 as@xmath25 @xmath26 where , @xmath27 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the energy density of matter .",
    "the energy conservation equation of matter is given by @xmath30 in the radiation / matter dominated phase , the universe is dominated by a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath31 . in this phase of evolution the density of matter",
    "@xmath32 dominates over the field @xmath28 . with the expansion of the universe over time the hubble parameter @xmath33 begins decreasing and the scalar field @xmath24 starts dominating .",
    "the total energy content of the universe @xmath34 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ eq : h ] ) reduces to @xmath35 which is difficult to solve analytically . in what follows",
    ", we shall solve the evolution equations numerically and plot the future evolution graphically .    introducing the dimensionless parameters @xmath36the system of equations ( [ eq : add1 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : phidd ] ) can be written as @xmath37 @xmath38here , we take @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the equation of state parameter @xmath6 for galileon field is defined as @xmath41    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we consider the galileon phantom field with exponential potential . this is the purely phenomenological case that is just to establish more liberty and workability . however , this type of potential breaks the galileon shift symmetry .",
    "it is alike to most of the phantom field models in which potentials are completely phenomenological .",
    "the system of equations ( [ eq : add1 ] ) and ( [ eq : phidd ] ) with the equation ( [ eq : dimension ] ) for an exponential potential can be written as @xmath42 where , we have used @xmath43 .",
    "now , we solve the system of equations ( [ p7 ] ) and ( [ p7n ] ) numerically with the equation ( [ eq : init ] ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath44 , the galileon phantom field model becomes standard phantom field model .",
    "here we consider an exponential potential which is more steeper than the linear one . in this potential , we obtain different type of future singularity . the scale factor",
    "@xmath45 diverges in distant future after a finite interval of time as shown in the upper right panel of figure [ figexp ] . in exponential potentials , hao and",
    "li obtained an attractor solution having @xmath46 forming the `` big rip '' unavoidable @xcite .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the energy density of phantom field blows up after finite interval of time and correspondingly the equation of state parameter @xmath6 blows up to @xmath47 ( see bottom panels of figure [ figexp ] ) .",
    "this type of singularity has been discussed in different models , namely , brane worlds @xcite , gauss - bonnet cosmology @xcite and tachyonic field @xcite . for higher values of @xmath19 , the big rip singularity",
    "is shifted in distant future .",
    "one can say that the big rip singularity is delayed for @xmath48 .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated cosmological dynamics of phantom and non phantom fields in presence of higher derivative galileon correction @xmath11 . for generality",
    ", we also studied phantom field with a general potential in order to check the impact of galileon term on the structure of singularity .    in case of @xmath44 , the galileon field ( with linear potential )",
    "reduces to standard quintessence . in this case , as field evolves to the region of negative values of the potential , after finite interval of time ( in future ) , the scale factor collapses giving rise to a big crunch singularity . to this effect",
    ", energy density of galileon field @xmath1 shows collapsing nature in future . in case of standard galileon field with linear potential",
    ", the big crunch singularity can be delayed depending upon the numerical values of @xmath19 such that for large values of the parameter , delay may be considerable making the singularity practically redundant ( see figure [ figquint ] ) .    as for the phantom field , there are three types of singularities depending upon the nature of potential . in case of @xmath49 , energy density diverges after infinite time for @xmath50 whereas divergence is reached after finite time dubbed _ big rip _ if @xmath51 including the case of exponential potential that corresponds to @xmath52 . in case of potentials steeper than the standard exponential , not only divergence of scale factor is reached in finite time but the equation of state parameter also diverges accordingly .",
    "we have examined the probable future regimes of universe with galileon phantom field having a linear potential . in case of @xmath44 ,",
    "the galileon phantom field reduces to standard phantom . due to negative sign in the kinetic term ,",
    "the field rises up along the potential giving rise to singularity in future .",
    "the nature of this singularity is different for different type of potentials . in case of linear potential with galileon phantom field ,",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath6 approaches @xmath4 with the slowly growing energy density compared to the standard case .",
    "for various values of @xmath19 ( 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 10 , 100 ) , we display our results in figure [ figphant ] which shows that the equation of state has less and less deviation from @xmath53cdm for larger values of @xmath19 and asymptotically approaches @xmath4 in distant future with the slowly increasing energy density as shown in the bottom panels of figure [ figphant ] . in case of exponential potential that is more steeper than the linear one",
    ", it has different type of singularity , the equation of state blows up to @xmath47 for a definite value of redshift and correspondingly the energy density @xmath1 diverges ( see bottom panels of figure [ figexp ] ) that is during a definite time an infinite energy density is reached and termed as `` big rip '' singularity .",
    "the approach to the singularity is delayed towards more and more distant future for larger values of @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore conclude that in general the effect of galileon correction to standard kinetic term in the lagrangian generally results in the delayed approach to singularity",
    ". it might be interesting to investigate the behaviour of singularity using the full galileon lagrangian including @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
