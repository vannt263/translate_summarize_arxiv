    "in this section we describe the dynamical situation in the frequency domain , and the resulting floquet band structure . given a periodic hamilton @xmath155 , with some period @xmath21 , one can write the time dependent schroedinger equation : @xmath156 and one can utilize the floquet theorem to subsequently write : @xmath157 with @xmath158 depending on various system parameters , but not @xmath37 . these coefficients ( or wave functions )",

    "can be decomposed in blocks of @xmath48 in the spin@xmath174photon space , or @xmath175 constitute a closed basis ( does not couple to other bands ) .",
    "more specifically , we obtain the following matrix : @xmath176 which can be casted in terms of a  pseudospin \" @xmath177 as follows : @xmath178 note that from the perspective of the superconductor , @xmath54 and @xmath177 act exactly in the same fashion",
    ". we can now easily interpret our results : in the extended zone scheme , the initial bands only couple the same @xmath179 in the absence of driving .",
    "however , once the driving is tuned on , the bands with adjacent @xmath163 s and opposite spins get mixed .",
    "moreover , each pair of such bands are shifted in energy by @xmath180 . to highlight this behavior , it worth doing the following comparison : the static spectrum , in the absence of driving , but presented in the extended zone scheme for a given frequency @xmath14 ( copies of the spectrum shifted by @xmath180 , but not interacting with each other for different @xmath163 s ) , and the floquet spectrum for the driven system , presented again in the extended zone scheme .",
    "we see that indeed , in the driven case , there is level crossing between adjacent @xmath163 s , with a splitting that can be evaluated from solving eq  .",
    "since the spectrum is composed of separated blocks that emulate the static hamiltonian , indifferent of the periodic or open boundary conditions , the entire edge structure and topology is given by these ( shifted , but equivalent ) blocks .",
    "on the left panel in figure [ anticrossings ] we plot the shiba band energies versus quasi - momentum in the absence of driving , showing also the floquet - like band structure ( bands are replicated artificially , using the value of driving for the right panel , since there is no driving on the left one ) .",
    "when we turn on the driving we see that the crossings of the left panel become the anticrossings on the right panel , where we plot quasi - energies ( floquet bands ) of shiba band versus quasi - momentum .",

    "in fig.2 in the main text we presented only the gap value of the shiba band taken at quasi - energy @xmath89 . for completeness we present also in figure [ gapatb ] the gap at quasi - energy @xmath90 .",
    "as discussed in the main text , no majorana fermions emerge at the latter quasi - energy value .",
    "in this section we present a simplified version of the implementation of a controlled dynamical helical texture in a circuit model . in fig .",
    "[ transport ] we present a sketch of our proposal : a chain of magnetic impurities on top of an @xmath0-wave superconductor forming spin helix ( texture ) of pitch @xmath18 and an angle @xmath15 is being sandwiched between to metallic leads with strong spin - orbit interaction . passing a charge current @xmath182 through the left metal gives rise to a spin accumulation @xmath183 at the edge via the spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "this spin bias , being non - collinear with the local magnetization on the left , gives rise to a local torque that brings the texture into precession .",
    "below we describe a simplified version of the model that describes quantitatively the induced precession of the texture , assuming the texture is rigid and that the entire spin is carried by the texture only . moreover , for simplicity , we assume no bulk gilbert damping of the ( precessing ) magnetic texture , although such a component is easily accommodated in our theory .",
    "our theoretical modeling follows closely the ideas developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for describing superfluid spin flow in planar ferromagnets .",

    "@xmath188 , namely in the dynamical case the applied spin bias ( or spin torque ) is reduced effectively by the spin pumping contribution @xcite .",
    "next we note that the spin texture posses @xmath189 symmetry , namely it is invariant with respect to rotations around the @xmath190 axis .",
    "that implies that the spin current along this direction is conserved , and thus we focus on the @xmath190 component only .",
    "also , we assume that for a rigid texture ( helix ) the spin precession satisfies : @xmath191\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath192 arbitrary .",
    "with this , the spin currents along @xmath190 at each end ( lead ) is found as follows : @xmath193 where we used the @xmath194 sign for the right spin current to emphasize that this is the current injected into the lead and not the flow into the texture ( which is just the opposite ) .",
    "since we assume no dissipation mechanisms in the bulk we have that @xmath195 , which gives for the precession frequency the following expression : @xmath196    we thus see that by controlling the spin biases on the two ends , via the spin hall , effect the precession frequency can be tuned at will .",
    "moreover , by tuning the biases such that @xmath197 , the precession frequency vanishes .",
    "more complicated models ( including , for example , dissipation , change in the cone angle , electrons , magnons , etc ) will alter this conclusion , but the general picture should still hold true . for completeness , we also provide with the resulting expression for the spin current at either of the ends : @xmath198 which vanishes any time one of the leads is disconnected .",
    "however , it does not necessary vanish in the case when @xmath14 vanishes ( see condition above ) .",
    "we note in passing that relaxing the condition of a rigid texture should allow , as stressed in the main text , to control non only the frequency , but also the pitch @xmath18 . for example , if the initial impurity spins are lying in - plane , but forming no helix in the absence of the leads , once subjected to spin biases will give rise to a dynamical texture such that the spin current is transported from the left to right lead . in a long wavelength description ,",
    "the hamiltonian describing such a setup reads @xcite : @xmath199/2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath200 and @xmath201 stand for the exchange stiffness and the anisotropy , respectively , where @xmath202 . for @xmath203",
    ", it was shown that the spin current ( along @xmath190 ) at some position @xmath204 in the chain between the two leads reads : @xmath205 which , in the absence of dissipation , should coincide with the spin currents at the left lead @xmath206 .",
    "in such a case , we can readily see that @xmath207 , with @xmath208 .",
    "the resulting pitch of the texture ( assuming , in the lattice model @xmath209 ) can be read as @xmath210 by inspecting the above conditions for the precession frequency and for the spin current , we see that by tuning the spin biases we can tune independently the frequency @xmath14 and the pitch @xmath18 ( we can even reduce the chain to the static case ) . thus , such an implementation is extremely versatile for implementing our proposed dynamical model ."

    "<S> the form of the functions @xmath56 is in general too complicated to be displayed . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are various limiting cases where analytical progress is possible . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on two limiting cases that can be studied both analytically and numerically , i.e. the short and the long coherence length , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the first case corresponds to a chain with only nearest neighbor hopping , in other words , the case of a small coherence length @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . in this limit , we need to set in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ vectors ] ) the following functions : @xmath59 where @xmath60\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 being the fermi momentum and @xmath62 denoting the zeroth modified bessel function of the second kind ( for further details see @xcite as well as @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the functions @xmath63 depend at least quadratically on the fictitious magnetic field @xmath40 , and for @xmath64 we can neglect such dependence in leading order .    </S>",
    "<S> the second limiting case describes a chain with very extended shiba states , i.e. with large coherence length compared to the impurity spacing , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the small coherence length regime , here all the higher order hopping processes become possible . </S>",
    "<S> in this regime we obtain the following expressions for the functions @xmath66 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> note that @xmath73 in the expressions given above plays the role of the gap parameter @xmath74 from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which , in the limit of @xmath64 is only slightly reduced by the fictitious field . on the other hand , @xmath75 is strongly affected by the driving , as it results in a shift of the alignment of the shiba bands , and eventually their topology . while @xmath76 does not change the topology of the bands , it does affect their overlap ( the absolute gap ) , and it can also depend strongly on @xmath40 for @xmath77 ( planar helix ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in such a case , the entire dependence on the magnetic field arises through this term in leading order which , however , is small for @xmath78 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> quasi - spectrum and topology . </S>",
    "<S> _ in what follows we study the topological properties of the hamiltonian in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamildvect ] ) in the short and long coherence length regimes introduced above . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum can be found easily as @xmath79 which , because of the periodic drive , is uniquely defined only up to an integer multiple of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need to fold the resulting spectrum into the first quasi - energy brillouin zone , @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting one - dimensional hamiltonian is real , and thus it belongs to the bdi symmetry class @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the number of majorana states emerging at one end in the case of open boundary conditions is given not by a @xmath81 , but by a @xmath82 invariant @xcite , which reads : @xmath83 with @xmath84 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this winding number characterizes the number of edge states . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not indicate the presence of an absolute gap in the system , meaning that it can be well defined even if the system is gapless . </S>",
    "<S> we depict such surprising features in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gapwithb ] , where we plot the absolute gap between the shiba bands , as well as the corresponding winding number , as functions of the driving frequency @xmath40 against the fermi momentum @xmath61 ( angle @xmath15 ) in the left ( right ) column . both the driving frequency and </S>",
    "<S> the precession angles are tunable parameters and , most strikingly , this shows that the system can undergo a topological phase transition by changing the driving frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that for the small coherence length regime ( top row ) the winding number can be calculated analytically ( see @xcite ) , whereas for the large coherence length ( bottom row ) we restrict ourselves to computing the integral in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ winding ] ) only numerically . can be also determined by utilizing pfaffian invariants reflecting parity of the winding number @xmath85 , as well as by employing the so - called ` singular points technique ' developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] a few more comments are in order . as expected for @xmath86 ( corresponding to a ferromagnetic arrangement of the impurity spins ) the gap is absent and the system is in a gapless trivial phase with zero winding number . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , when @xmath87 the spin helix is planar . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn means that the fictitious magnetic field @xmath40 appearing in the rotating frame [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ schrstat ] ) ] does not couple to the chain , which explains why no change of phase occurs while changing the driving frequency for @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the system always enters a topological superconducting phase .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important signatures of topological systems are topological edge states . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tbspectrum ] we show the quasi - spectrum for a dynamical chain with open boundary conditions and for the case of a short coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> we see that majorana bound states ( mbs ) emerges at zero energy ( red line ) , and that their existence range is in perfect agreement with the bulk winding number calculation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that the mbs even exist in regions where the system is gapless , albeit they are not protected anymore by the gap and any impurities could easily mix them with the bulk ( extended ) states . while for a region of the parameter space we found gaps at both @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tbspectrum ] ) , only the modes at the former are emerging for the circular driving utilized in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a conclusion should not hold for more general drivings of the magnetic texture .    </S>",
    "<S> _ detection and physical implementations . _ </S>",
    "<S> the dynamically generated mbs described above could be detected in transport measurements by nearby voltage biased stm tip @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could utilize a recent scheme that relies on the pumped charge by the precessing texture into the stm tip at different position in the chain in the absence of any applied voltage @xcite . in order to generate the dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> we envision several implementations , depending on the way the magnetic texture emerges in the first place . in the case of a pre - formed helix , either due to </S>",
    "<S> the the rkky interaction mediated by electrons in the superconductor @xcite , or due to the soi in the substrate @xcite , the precession of the helix corresponds simply to global rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional way to excite such a mode is by driving the helix with microwaves that excite the ferromagnetic resonance associated with such a rotation mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , in recent years there have been tremendous progress in exciting magnetic devices in transport setup by means of the spin hall effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup would allow for an all - electrical implementation of a dynamical magnetic texture - superconductor hybrid , with a controllable frequency ( see @xcite for details on the implementation ) . </S>",
    "<S> both these methods can give rise to rotations of the helix , but do not result in changes of the pitch . however , when the impurities form a planar ferromagnet ( with exchange interaction keeping the spins in a plane ) , it becomes possible to control the pitch @xmath18 , the frequency @xmath14 , and the cone angle @xmath15 by means of spin biases , as showed recently in several works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this goes by the name of spin superfluidity , as there is a direct mapping between a superfluid flow ( such as in he@xmath91 ) and the magnetization flow in such a planar spin configuration . </S>",
    "<S> as detailed in @xcite , such manipulations are possible simply by changing the spin biases induced by the spin hall effect applied over the planar spin configuration , with a pitch in one - to - one correspondence with the spin super - current flowing through the magnetic system , and an adjustable frequency depending on the relative biases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ discussions and perspectives . _ </S>",
    "<S> the setup proposed in this work can be generalized to a chain of precessing magnetic impurities deposited on top of a 3d superconductor . despite a modification in the shiba wavefunction coherence length , we expect no qualitative difference in our main argument concerning a controlled topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a 3d superconductor is expected to reflect the short coherence length regime , whereas a 2d one  the long coherence length regime . as a future extension of this work we propose to consider more complicated networks of driven magnetic impurities , e.g. a 2d array . </S>",
    "<S> also , generalizations to more complicated textures and precessions is in order , as our perfect rotation wave description would break down , and a fully floquet approach would be required . the same arguments should apply when the substrate ( superconductor ) posses spin - orbit interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , in this paper we proposed a way to engineer a controllable topological phase transition by means of magnetization texture dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that a chain of precessing classical spins deposited on top of an s - wave superconductor gives rise to a topologically non - trivial shiba band , and we have demonstrated that topological phase transitions in such a band can be controlled by changing the driving frequency , a tunable parameter in the spin transport experiments .    _ </S>",
