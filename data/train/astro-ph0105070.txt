    "several recent studies ( ossendrijver 1998 ; tobias 1998 ; brandenburg et al . 1998 ; saar & brandenburg 1999 [ = sb ] ; lanza & rodon 1999 ) have revisited relationships between stellar magnetic cycles and other stellar properties , taking advantage of the increased quality and quality of the cycle data available ( e.g. , baliunas et al . 1995 ) .",
    "sb studied relationships between non - dimensional quantities such as cycle - to - rotational frequency ratio /@xmath0 , the normalized ca ii hk emission flux @xmath3 , and the inverse rossby number ro@xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the convective turnover time ) .",
    "they found evidence for three power - law ",
    "branches \" upon which stars tended to cluster . here",
    "we expand on this work .",
    "we add new cycle data , and investigate how the new data affect various parameterizations , both dimensional and non - dimensional , of the stellar cycles , focusing on relations between  and rotation .",
    "we combine cycle and stellar data gathered by sb with more recent measurements of plage ( e.g. , hatzes et al .",
    "2000 ) and spot cycles ( e.g. , olh et al . 2000 ) .",
    "cyclic changes in @xmath6 in some close binaries have been linked with magnetic cycle modulation ( via changes in mean magnetic pressure ) of stellar quadrupole moments ( lanza et al .",
    "these cycles based on variations in @xmath6 ( lanza & rodon 1999 ) are also tentatively included .",
    "we follow the strategy of sb , using theoretical @xmath5 ( gunn et al . 1998 ) and weighting the @xmath7 by a  quality factor \" @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) depending on the strength of the periodogram signal or clarity of the cycle modulation .",
    "we set @xmath10 for the @xmath6-change cycles .",
    "stars are assigned to branches ( where appropriate ) by eye to minimize fit rms .",
    "evolved stars were not included in the fits due to less well determined @xmath5 .",
    "results for different classes of stars are shown in fig . 1 left ( using dimensionless /@xmath0 and ro@xmath1 ) and fig . 1 right ( using  = @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * ( 1 ) * three branches  denoted i ( inactive ) , a ( active ) , and s ( super - active )  appear in both the ro@xmath1 and @xmath0 parameterizations ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for the ro@xmath1 fit ,",
    "the power law exponents are @xmath13 ( with a fit dispersion @xmath14 dex ) , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 dex ) ; for the @xmath0 fit , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 dex ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 dex ) , and @xmath17 ( @xmath23 dex ) .",
    "thus the rms scatter is similar for the two parameterizations .    *",
    "( 2 ) * secondary cycle periods ( 2 ) seen in some stars often lie on one of the branches ( though this is more rare in s branch stars ) .",
    "the solar gleissberg  cycle \" ( @xmath24 years ) appears to lie on the s branch .",
    "the preferred branch of the primary @xmath7 ( with the strongest periodogram signal ) may be mass and @xmath0 dependent .",
    "multiple @xmath7 may reflect multiple dynamo modes in an @xmath25 framework ( knobloch , rosner & weiss 1981 ) , or different dynamos existing in separate latitude zones ( note the dual , separately evolving activity patterns in the double @xmath7 star @xmath26 comae ; donahue & baliunas 1992 ) . in the babcock - leighton scenario ,",
    "2  may be excited by stochastic variations in the poloidal source term ( charbonneau & dikpati 2000 ) .    * ( 3 ) * a single power law can be fit to the data ( e.g. , @xmath27 , sb ; see also baliunas et al .",
    "1996 ) but only at the expense of a considerably higher dispersion about the fit ( @xmath28 dex ) , and loss of an explanation for the secondary cycle periods ( since they no longer reside on another dynamo  branch \" ) .    *",
    "( 4 ) * evolved stars typically lie near branches , though show more scatter than the dwarfs . since the increased scatter is seen in both parameterizations ,",
    "it is unlikely to be due to less precise @xmath5 in evolved stars ( indeed , arguably the scatter in evolved stars is reduced using ro@xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 based on @xmath6 variation ( lanza & rodon 1999 ) also follow the general trends . the branches are better separated using ro@xmath1 . on the other hand , the @xmath0 plot is simpler , lacking the  transitional \" regime between the a and s branches seen in the ro@xmath1 diagrams .",
    "contact binaries ( gray @xmath29 ; bottom panels ) are poorly fit in both schemes ( worse if ro@xmath1 is used ) ; their dynamos may be altered by turbulent energy transfer toward the secondary ( hazlehurst 1985 ) which is independent of rotation .    * ( 5 ) * the branches may merge for small ro@xmath1 or @xmath0 ( though at values which might not be reached by actual stars ) .",
    "curiously , the ratio of the power law exponents for the @xmath0 fits are @xmath30 .    * ( 6 ) * since @xmath0 and ro@xmath1 decrease in time on the main - sequence , the relations between  and rotation map out dynamo evolution with time .",
    "the overlapping branches and 2  suggest that  evolves in time in a complex , sometimes multi - valued fashion .",
    "the panels of figure 1 left show an approximate age calibration along the top axes .",
    "a babcock - leighton type model predicts @xmath31 for solar - like dwarfs ( where @xmath32 is the meridional flow velocity ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ) . if @xmath32 increases approximately linearly with @xmath0 in slower rotators ( e.g. , brummell et al .",
    "1998 ) , the predicted  matches the i and a branches reasonably well ( see also charbonneau & saar , this volume )",
    ". mean - field models with sufficiently strong @xmath0 dependence for the differential rotation ( e.g. , donahue et al .",
    "1996 ) and the @xmath33 effect ( e.g. , brandenburg & schmitt 1998 ) can also match the observed branches ( sb ; charbonneau & saar , this volume ) .",
    "we are studying a variety of dynamo models to better understand the implications of the cycle - rotation relations seen here ."
