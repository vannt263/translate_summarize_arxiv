    "[ fig : image ] , the acoustic sensors obscure small regions of the inner volume close to the jar wall ; while the entire volume is visible to at least one camera , a well - reconstructed event requires that both cameras observe the bubble and agree on the number of bubbles observed .",
    "roughly halfway through the run , one of the cameras began observing increased digital noise .",
    "while the images were still of high quality , the noisy camera had to be removed from the trigger , leading to the late observation of bubbles that formed in the areas partially hidden from the second camera .",

    "additional quality cuts are applied to all data to eliminate events with excessive acoustic noise and events where the acoustically reconstructed time of bubble formation was outside of the expected range .",

    "the method is similar to that outlined in  @xcite , where the cut parameters to be optimized over were the two end points of an interval in a single variable . in  @xcite the method was generalized to be applicable to an arbitrary set of cuts and applied to threshold - dependent one - sided cuts on the time since the previous bubble event .",

    "the principal idea of the method is to compare the data to a large number of simulated random data sets with various assumed wimp - induced expected signal event rates , and no background . by comparing the optimum cuts for the experimental and simulated data sets , we find the expected signal rate where the optimized cuts for @xmath72 of simulated experiments with that expected signal rate have the same or worse sensitivity as the experimental data .",
    "the assumption of no background in the simulated data sets is conservative , since the inclusion of background events in the model can only reduce the number of events attributed to wimp interactions , resulting in a more stringent upper limit on the wimp - induced rate .",
    "the cut optimization method assumes that all events in the data set constitute a potential dark matter signal .",
    "however , the distributions shown in figs .  [ fig : ap_standard_all ] ,  [ fig : ratevste ] , and  [ fig : bubble_xyz ] are clearly inconsistent with such an assumption .",

    "the cuts on each of the variables are applied sequentially , and the ordering is chosen based on which of the remaining variables distributions is the least consistent with dark matter .    to illustrate how this is applied , we begin with the full data set .",

    "fig : ap_standard_all ] , as well as ks tests between the observed expansion time and zsurf distributions and simulated dark matter signals . while all three ks tests return p values of less than 10@xmath101 that the two samples under test are drawn from the same distribution , the largest ks - test statistic ( corresponding to the smallest correspondence between the distributions under test ) is found for @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore impose an upper limit cut on the value of @xmath65 and slowly lower that cut value until the ks test between the calibration data and the background events returns a p value @xmath102 .",
    "this occurs for @xmath103 , with 32 events remaining .",
    "with the @xmath103 cut in place , we perform new ks tests of the expansion time and zsurf distributions between the simulated dark matter signals and the remaining background , finding a p value for expansion time of @xmath104 and the p value for the zsurf distribution of @xmath105 .",
    "we follow the same procedure , increasing the one - sided cut on expansion time until once again the ks test returns a p value @xmath102 .",
    "we repeat the process one more time on zsurf .",
    "no cut is made on dwall beyond the nominal fiducial cut , as the dwall distribution is consistent with dark matter at the 3@xmath21 level .",
    "the corresponding cuts defining the restricted data set are shown in table  [ table : cuts ] .",
