    "more recently , interesting models have been proposed for such dynamical branes with rich structures , constructed with one @xcite or more @xcite scalar fields ( see also the review given by ref .",
    "the issue of localization of several fields and resonances in such branes is an interesting subject , as their investigation can guide us to which kind of brane structure is more acceptable phenomenologically . in this way ,",
    "models which extend the randall - sundrum type ii scenario @xcite were constructed and considered under the aspect of gravity localization @xcite .",
    "reviewing works about fermions in extra dimension models , we observed that in type i randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario @xcite , spin @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 fermions , are located only in the negative tension brane .",
    "however , they do not satisfy the localization conditions in the type ii rs model . in these",
    "two cited models , the localization of zero mode chiral fermions is only obtained due to the introduction of a generalized yukawa coupling .",
    "this is analogous to what happens to domain walls in the absence of gravity @xcite . in the brane case",
    "the coupling is introduced by an interaction of fermions with a bulk scalar field .",
    "the scalar field solution can be kink like , for instance .",
    "thus , the results with the rs model indicate that the thick brane scenarios as the most suitable for locating fermions .",
    "thick brane models can be obtained from scalar fields with kink - like solutions .",
    "therefore , the scalar field that couples with fermions in the yukawa coupling will be the scalar field which the brane is made of .    quite recently , liu et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the issue of fermion localization on a pure geometrical thick brane . since then",
    ", the same group of authors have published a series of papers on fermion localization on several types of thick branes @xcite . also , some of the authors of the present work were the first to consider fermionic resonances in branes with internal structure @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the kind of structure of the considered brane is very important and will produce implications concerning the methods of field localization . in the seminal works of bazeia and collaborators @xcite a class of topological defect solutions was constructed starting from a specific deformation of the @xmath6 potential .",
    "these new solutions may be used to mimic new brane - worlds containing internal structures @xcite .",
    "such internal structures have implications in the density of matter - energy along the extra dimensions @xcite and this produces a space - time background whose curvature has a splitting , as we will show in this work , if compared to the usual models .",
    "some characteristics of such model were considered in phase transitions in warped geometries @xcite .",
    "considering a brane world scenario like a 4d domain wall immersed in a 5d space - time , we were able to find a localized left chiral zero mode .",
    "therefore , if we consider a deformed brane , we obtain new results related to the localization of spin @xmath4 fields . also , such class of models where already studied with respect to gravity localization @xcite , where it was found that zero - modes for kk gravitons exist , the solutions are stable and tachyons are forbidden .    the main goal here is to study the behavior of fermions and gravity in a membrane with internal structure generated by a deformation procedure .",
    "we modify the so - called two - kink solutions that can be obtained after a deformation procedure of a potential from a scalar field @xcite .",
    "we analyze fermion localization on such branes , considering such deformations that suggest the existence of an internal structure .",
    "as we will see , the deformations will be very important for localization and normalization of fermionic fields . using a well known resonance detecting method @xcite",
    ", we analyze the massive modes arising from the dimensional reduction functions .",
    "modes with large amplitudes near the brane can reveal us details about the coupling of modes with the brane .",

    "first of all note that from eqs .",
    "( [ fqm ] ) the spectrum of the right and left chiralities are related .",
    "indeed , the spectrum starts with zero mode with right chirality and even parity .",
    "the two resonances with same @xmath148 that succeed in the spectrum are the first odd parity left chiral mode and the first even parity right chiral mode .",
    "next we also have two resonances with same @xmath148 : the first even parity left chiral mode and the first odd parity right chiral mode .",
    "we successively have in the spectrum even and odd parity wavefunctions for left and right chiral modes with same values of @xmath148 .",
    "one can easily check the formation of dirac fermions after studying the odd parity wavefunctions .",
    "this needs the changing the normalization procedure in a known procedure @xcite ( for an analysis with models with two scalar fields , see ref .",
    "we checked the correspondence of the spectrum for some values for resonances with odd parity wavefunctions , but we will not pursue this subject in detail , since the numerical procedure was tested with confidence and the formation of the dirac fermions are guaranteed by the supersymmetric quantum mechanics structure . also the study of even parity wavefunctions for massive fermions is interesting since we can compare our findings with the results for massive gravitons in the first part of this paper .",
    "the spectra for @xmath127 and @xmath124 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "there one can see how the increasing in @xmath3 increases the number of resonances .",
    "note also that the resonances appear coupled in pairs for left and right chiralities ( here we consider only even parity wavefunctions ) .",
    "we also see that an increasing of @xmath3 increases the mass of the first resonance , generally being a very thin line in the spectrum .",
    "the fact that the lines for left and right chiralities alternate each other in the spectrum is very important for capture the thinner lines in the numerical procedure .",
    "in this work we have studied localization of fermions and gravity in a model of deformed branes .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 of the model controls important features as the brane thickness and energy distribution along the extra dimension .",
    "we found that the increasing of @xmath3 cause a splitting in the ricci scalar , evidencing the appearance of an internal structure , as can be found also from the energy density analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate metric perturbations as decoupled from the scalar ones in the transverse - traceless gauge . from the asymptotic behavior of the shrdinger - like equation",
    "it can be proved that gravity is localized for all parameters @xmath3 , and tachyonic gravity modes are absent .",
    "resonances in the gravity sector are observed for @xmath1 and @xmath129 as peaks in the @xmath57 distribution .",
    "however , larger values of @xmath3 lead to produce broader peaks that can not technically characterize themselves as resonances .",
    "this means that thinner branes are more effective for trapping gravity .",
    "next we studied the presence of fermionic zero - modes after introducing a yukawa coupling between the 5-dimensional spinor and the scalar field , depending on a parameter @xmath80 .",
    "after a chiral decomposition we obtained a shrdinger - like equation also for fermionic scalar functions that characterize localization of left or right chiral modes and investigated its normalizability .",
    "we found that zero - mode exist only for left chirality and that tachyonic fermionic modes are absent .",
    "the investigation of fermionic resonances is a subject possible here only numerically .",
    "however , from the qualitative character of the shrdinger potentials we were able to observe that for large values of @xmath80 the behavior of localization of fermions is favored for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "this is contrary to the observed for gravity , where the localization of kk gravity modes are favored for small values of @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis of small values of @xmath80 could lead to similar behavior for gravitons and fermions .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath80 can not be reduced below a threshold where the presence of fermionic zero - modes are forbidden . for @xmath80 above this threshold",
    "the effective action is finite .",
    "the presence of fermionic resonances was investigated for even parity wavefunctions both for left and right chiralities .",
    "we analyzed how the presence of the yukawa coupling influenced our findings , with larger values of @xmath80 and @xmath3 favouring the increasing of resonances .",
    "some resonances are extremely thin and more difficult to be found .",
    "the quantum mechanical supersymmetric character of the shrdinger - like potentials for left and right chiral fermions guarantee that dirac fermions are realized in the model and that the spectral lines for left and right fermions with same parity must alternate in the diagram .",
    "this is very helpful in the numerical process for finding resonances , serving as a guide for reducing the numerical step when a resonance line is not captured .",
    "the lightest modes in the spectrum correspond to the thinnest lines , showing that those modes couple strongly with the brane in comparison to the kk modes with higher masses .",
    "this is expected as lightest modes have lower energy to escape from the brane shrdinger potential .",
    "as the inverse of the peak width to half maximum is proportional to the lifetime of the resonance @xcite , thinner peaks may correspond to particles in nature with sufficiently large lifetimes to be important in phenomenology .",
