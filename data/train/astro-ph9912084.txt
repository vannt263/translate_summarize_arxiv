    "understanding the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb or xrb ) and cosmological evolution of x - ray extragalactic populations is one of the main goals of x - ray astronomy . in the soft x - ray band , the _ rosat _  satellite resolved 80% of the 0.52 kev cxb into individual sources ( hasinger _ et al . _  1998 ) and optical identification revealed that the major population is type - i agns ( schmidt _ et al._1998 ) . because of the technical difficulties , imaging sky surveys in the hard x - ray band ( above 2 kev ) , where the bulk of the cxb energy arises , were not available until the launch of _",

    "1991 ) are at most @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) , and the sources observed by them only account for 3% of the cxb intensity in the 210 kev band . in particular , there is a big puzzle on the cxb origin , called the `` spectral paradox '' : bright agns observed with _ heao1 _ , _ exosat _ and _ ginga _  have spectra with an average photon index of @xmath5 = 1.7@xmath61.9 ( e.g. , williams _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) , which is significantly softer than that of the cxb itself ( @xmath7 1.4 ; e.g. , gendreau _ et al . _",
    "furthermore , the broad band properties of sources at fluxes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) are somewhat puzzling according to previous studies .",

    "1997 ) when we assume a power - law photon index of 1.7 .",
    "the _ asca _  satellite ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) , launched in 1993 february , was expected to change this situation .",
    "it is the first imaging satellite capable of study of the x - ray band above 2 kev with a sensitivity up to several @xmath10erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) and covers the wide energy band from 0.5 to 10 kev , which allows us to directly compare results of the energy bands below and above 2 kev with single detectors , hence accompanied with much less uncertainties than previous studies . by taking these advantages ,",

    "because these surveys are limited in sky coverage , the sample size is not sufficient to obtain a self - consistent picture about the evolution of the sources over the wide fluxes , from @xmath8 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) which is the sensitivity limit of _ heao1 _  a2 ( piccinotti _ et al . _  1982",
    ") , down to @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) , that of _ asca _  . to complement these shortcomings ,",
    "we have been working on the project called the `` _ asca _  medium sensitivity survey ( amss ) '' , or the gis catalog project . in the project , we utilize the gis data from the fields that have become publicly available to search for serendipitous sources .",
    "the large field of view and the low - background characteristics make the gis instrument ideal for this purpose .",
    "main results from the amss are reported in ueda _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999b ) , which were obtained from selected gis fields of @xmath11 observed from 1993 to 1996 , covering the total sky area of 106 deg@xmath12 .",
    "the sample contains 714 serendipitous sources , of which 696 , 323 , and 438 sources are detected in the 0.77 kev ( total ) , 210 kev ( hard ) , and 0.72 kev ( soft ) band , respectively .",
    "this is currently the largest x - ray sample covering the 0.710 kev band .",
    "figure  2(a ) shows the correlation between the 0.77 kev flux and the hardness ratio between the 210 kev and 0.72 kev count rates .",
    "we also plot the average hardness ratio in several flux ranges , separated by the dashed curves , with crosses .",
    "it is clearly seen that the average spectrum becomes harder with a decreasing flux : the corresponding photon index ( assuming a power law over the 0.710 kev band with no absorption ) changes from 2.1 at the flux of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  to 1.6 at @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 0.77 kev ) .",
    "similar hardening are also reported in the 210 kev range by della ceca _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) using 60 serendipitous sources .",
    "figure  2(b ) shows the integral log @xmath0 - log @xmath1 relations in the 0.77 kev survey band for the soft source sample , consisting of sources with an apparent 0.710 kev photon index larger than 1.7 , and for the hard source sample , with an index smaller than 1.7 .",
    "this demonstrates that sources with hard energy spectra in the 0.710 kev range are rapidly increasing with decreasing fluxes , compared with softer sources .",
    "the _ asca _  surveys have brought a clear , self - consistent picture about statistical properties of sources that constitute about 30% of the cxb in the broad energy band of 0.710 kev .",
    "figure  3 summarizes the 210 kev log @xmath0 - log @xmath1 relation  obtained from the _ asca _  surveys together with the results from previous missions .",
    "the direct source counts from combined results of the lss ( ueda _ et al . _",
    "1999b ) and the amss ( ueda _ et al._1999c ; these contain the data used by cagnoni , della ceca , & maccacaro 1998 ) give the tightest constraints so far over a wide flux range from @xmath2 to @xmath13 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 : @xmath14 = 16.8@xmath157.2 ( 90% statistical error ) , 11.43@xmath152.4 , 3.76@xmath150.42 , 1.08@xmath150.17 , and 0.33@xmath150.09 deg@xmath12 , at @xmath1 = @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the dss gives a direct source counts at the faintest flux , @xmath21 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4(ogasaka _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , whereas the fluctuation analysis of deep sis fields constrains the log @xmath0 - log @xmath1 relation  at fluxes down to @xmath22 ( gendreau , barcons , & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "as seen from the figure , the _ asca _  direct source counts smoothly connect the two regions constrained by the _",
    "ginga _  and _ asca _  fluctuation analysis .",
    "the amss / lss results demonstrate that the average spectrum of x - ray sources becomes harder toward fainter fluxes : the apparent photon index in the 0.710 kev range changes from 2.1 at the flux of @xmath23 to 1.6 at @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) .",
    "this fact can be explained by the rapid emergence of population with hard energy spectra , as is clearly indicated in figure  2(b ) .",
    "the evolution of broad - band properties of sources solves the puzzle of discrepancy discrepancy of the source counts between the soft ( emss ) and the hard band ( _ ginga _  and _ heao1 _ ) .",
    "if we compare the _ asca _  log @xmath0 - log @xmath1 relations ( including galactic objects ) between above and below 2 kev , the hard band source counts at @xmath24 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  ( 210 kev ) matches the soft band one when we assume a photon index of 1.6 for flux conversion , whereas at brighter level of @xmath25 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4(210 kev ) , we have to use a photon index of about 1.9 to make them match .",
    "the latter fact is consistent with the average 0.710 kev spectrum at the same flux levels , and can be connected the the `` soft '' spectrum of the fluctuation observed with _ ginga _ , which shows a photon index of 1.8@xmath26 in the 210 kev range ( butcher _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the optical identification revealed that the major population at fluxes of @xmath27 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4  are agns .",
    "the population of hard sources , which are most responsible for making the average spectrum hard , are x - ray absorbed sources . they are mostly identified as narrow line ( type-2 ) agns .",
    "the contribution of these type-2 agns is larger in the hard band than in the soft band at the same flux limit .",
    "recent results of the 510 kev band survey by _ bepposax _  confirms this tendency ( fiore _ et al . _",
    "these results support the scenario that the cxb consists of unabsorbed agns and absorbed agns , whose contribution becomes more significant with decreasing fluxes and in harder energy band .",
    "we found , however , possible evidence that is not consistent with the `` unified scheme '' of agns ( e.g. , awaki _ et al . _",
    "1991 ) , on which many agn synthesis models are based .",
    "the lss results may imply deficiency of x - ray luminous , absorbed agns , with @xmath28 at @xmath29 = 0.52 , or in the x - ray luminosity range larger than @xmath30 erg s@xmath3 , although we can not rule out possibility , for example , that there are many luminous agns at @xmath31 with extreme heavy absorption of @xmath32 . on the other hand",
    ", there is another implication that there could be a population of agns at high redshifts ( @xmath33 ) that are optically identified as type-1 agns but have apparently hard x - ray spectra , although the origin of the hardness is not clear yet .",
    "future surveys by _ chandra _ and _ xmm",
    "_ together with optical identification of the amss sources will reveal the luminosity , number , and spectral evolutions of extra - galactic populations including absorbed agns , which will eventually lead us to full understanding of the origin of the cxb .",
