    "the physics of the doubly strange hypernuclei , ( @xmath1 ) hypernuclei and double ( @xmath0 ) hypernuclei , presents some novelties with respect to the traditional hypernuclear investigations .",
    "@xmath1 atoms , whose formation is an intermediate step toward the @xmath0-hypernucleus , can give information about the interplay of the coulomb and strong force in the low nuclear density region , while the @xmath1 decay inside the nucleus can shed light on the yn interaction at s=-2 .",
    "it is worth to underline that the @xmath0 hypernuclei are the only possible tool to investigate the hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "in fact the elementary hyperon - nucleon scattering data are scarce and the hyperon - hyperon data are totally absent .",
    "the crucial parameter in testing the potential models is the difference between the binding energy of the @xmath0 hypernucleus and twice the binding energy of each @xmath2 in the core nucleus .",
    "this parameters is experimentally achievable through spectroscopy measurements .",
    "very interesting aspects of the doubly strange systems are the different contributions of the strange and not strange mesons to the @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath3-@xmath0 coupling interaction mechanism .",
    "moreover , the production of hyperfragments is related to the hyperon - hyperon interaction mechanism and can be a test for different models @xcite .",
    "also the @xmath2 decay processes show a peculiar aspect in the double hypernuclei : mesonic and non - mesonic decays can occur simultaneously and , among the non - mesonic ones , the hyperon - induced mechanism could play a role in addition to the nuclear induced one . + the panda collaborations aims to investigate , among others , the double strangeness using the high energy antiprotons of the future fair facility at gsi .",
    "measurements are planned in both nuclear spectroscopy and weak decay fields .",
    "the required high precision in spectroscopy will be achieved using ge crystals , whose performances in the region of the fringing field have been already successfully tested .",
    "the weak decay products will be detected by si-@xmath4strips located in a suitable arrangement together with the hypernuclear target around the antiproton beam pipe .",
    "the fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) complex @xcite , located in the gsi site , will include the ring hesr ( high energy storage ring ) to store antiprotons of energy between 0.8 to 14.4 mev .",
    "intense and high quality beams are foreseen : luminosity up to @xmath5 and momentum resolution up to @xmath6 are expected .",
    "the new technique proposed by the panda collaboration @xcite to produce double hypernuclei with antiprotons , is based on the reaction :    @xmath7    in this reaction two different targets are used , the first one ( primary target ) where @xmath1 is produced and the second one ( secondary target ) where @xmath0 hypernucleus is formed .",
    "the whole process proceeds through the following steps : a ) reaction ( 1 ) occurs quasi free in a nucleus , b ) @xmath1 re - scatters in the residual nucleus and it is strongly decelerated , c ) @xmath1 slows down to stop , d ) is captured by an atom , e ) undergoes to an atomic cascade , f ) is captured into the nucleus , g ) makes the conversion reaction :    @xmath8    steps a ) and b ) occur in the primary target while the other ones in the secondary . after reaction",
    "( 2 ) both @xmath9s can stick to the nucleus or not : the fact that the excess of energy is 28 mev makes the probability of both sticking rather high .",
    "the designed apparatus for double hypernuclei physics is sketched in fig.[panda ] ( left ) and includes the primary and secondary targets in expanded view in fig.[panda ] ( right ) .",
    "the efficiency of this target arrangement has been evaluated by simulation @xcite and the ratio r of the stopped @xmath1 in the secondary target to the number of produced @xmath1 in reaction ( 1 ) is reported in table [ rates ] as a function of different primary targets for a fixed @xmath10 secondary target .",
    "the efficiency depends slightly on the mass number of the primary target material : for secondary targets of heavier nuclei one should expect an improvement of the efficiency , due to a faster slowing down to stop of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore an efficiency of the order of @xmath11 has to be combined with the rate of @xmath1 produced at hesr , to get the @xmath1 stopped rate .",
    "the production rate will depend on the beam profile and on the constraints due to the radiation damage of the panda detectors .",
    "the designed structure of the antiproton beam @xcite and a preliminary estimate of the radiation tolerance of @xmath12 @xmath13 charged particle / s allow to expect a rate of @xmath12 0.17 stopped @xmath1/s using a @xmath10 primary target .",
    "such a rate will produce in one month a number of stopped @xmath1 higher than the existing statistics .",
    "concerning the efficiency in detecting the @xmath1 , it must be remarked that also an anti - hyperon is released in reaction ( 1 ) , which annihilates mostly inside the primary target .",
    "this annihilation produces ( at least ) two anti - kaons and this peculiar aspect will be used as a tool for a high - level trigger .",
    "detection of x - rays from hyperatoms @xcite and gamma - rays from double hypernuclear processes plays a crucial role in the hypernuclear program of panda . to achieve the required resolution , high purity germanium detectors ( hpge )",
    "are planned to be installed .",
    "a common feature of the general purpose apparatuses , like panda , is the presence of large spectrometers with intense magnetic fields . in the panda set - up a set of hpge detectors",
    "will be located upstream the target ( see fig.[panda ] , left ) , just in front of the upstream end of the solenoid .",
    "the set of ge crystals will be assembled to cover almost 2@xmath14 solid angle and they will be located in the area when the the fringing field is not negligible . due to the magnetic field effects on the charge carrier trajectories the performances of the ge detectors could be modified as well as the electronic circuits could be affected .",
    "moreover the data acquisition lasts in general several weeks or months .",
    "therefore it is mandatory to check whether relevant changes in the performances of the hpge detector might occur and if such changes are depending on the time spent in operating inside the magnetic field .",
    "tests of long duration ( about 1 year ) have been performed on a hpge crystal of the same sizes and features of those ones planned for panda @xcite .",
    "the result showed that the worsening of the resolution was within 10% in the @xmath15 range from 0.08 mev to 1.333 mev and that such a worsening was not at all permanent .",
    "these results allow to design the relative position of the crystals and of the primary target in order to maximize the acceptance .",

    "a new technique for producing @xmath1 and double hypernuclei from antiproton at 3 gev / c has been proposed in panda experiment .",
    "the designed two targets system will allow different hypernuclei be formed with good efficiency .",
    "the expected rates of stopped @xmath1 have been estimated to be sufficient in increasing the present amount of the double hypernuclei data up to a statistically significant amount .",
    "high resolution and stability of the hpge in detecting the x and @xmath15 rays will be of basic importance in the measurements of the hypernuclear system .",
    "preliminary tests of the detectors inside the magnetic field have been successfully performed .",
    "+ both high @xmath1 rates and performances are promising a step forward in understanding many important aspects of the strong interaction in the s=-2 systems and in the hyperon weak decay .",
