    "gravitationally lensed compact radio sources have many astrophysical and cosmological applications , amongst which the determination of a time  delay to constrain the hubble constant is best known ( refsdal 1964 ) .",
    "once a time ",
    "delay has been determined from the image light curves , they can be subtracted to see if any externally induced variability is present . external variability in compact radio sources",
    "can be the result of either scintillation by the galactic ionized ism ( rickett 1990 ) or microlensing by compact objects in the lens galaxy ( chang & refsdal 1979 ) .",
    "unambiguous external variability thus offers the opportunity to study either the ionized medium towards the lens images or the mass function of compact objects in high  z galaxies . here",
    ", we discuss both possibilities as the source of the external variability observed in the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 ( koopmans & de bruyn 1999 [ kb99 ] ) .",
    "b1600 + 434 was observed from february to october 1998 with the vla at 8.5ghz , in order to determine a time delay between the two lens images ( koopmans et al .",
    "1999 [ kbxf99 ] ) . in fig.[fig-1 ] , the normalized vla 8.5ghz light curves of both lens images are shown , created by subtracting a linear fit and subsequently normalizing them to unity ( kbxf99 ) .",
    "the resulting normalized light curves have rms variabilities of 2.8% and 1.6% for images a and b , respectively .",
    "subsequently , the observed linearly  interpolated light curve of image  b was subtracted from the light curve of image  a , after having corrected it for a flux density ratio of 1.212 and a time delay of 47 days ( kbxf99 ) .",
    "the normalized difference light curve ( fig.[fig-2 ] ) has an rms variability of 3.2% , which is inconsistent with a flat difference light curve at the 14.6@xmath0 confidence level .",
    "a time delay different from 47 days only increases the confidence level , as a result of using a minimum  dispersion method to determine the time delay ( kbxf99 ) .",
    "below we investigate both scintillation and microlensing , as possible causes of the external variability in the lens images of b1600 + 434 .",
    "we regard extreme scattering ( fiedler 1987 ) as unlikely and will not further discuss it here .",
    "the reader is referred to kb99 for a full discussion of all the details .",
    "scintillation , caused by the galactic ionized ism , can explain both large amplitude variability in very compact extra ",
    "galactic radio sources and lower amplitude ` flicker ' of more extended sources ( rickett 1990 ) . in b1600 + 434a and b ,",
    "we observe several percent rms variability , possibly consistent with ` flickering ' .",
    "the time scale is harder to quantify , but it appears that we see variability time scales of several days up to several weeks ( figs [ fig-1][fig-2 ] ) .    let us summarize the arguments against scintillation : ( i ) the modulation index between the lens images differs , even though one looks at the same background source .",
    "this requires either significantly different scattering measures ( sm@xmath3/sm@xmath4=3.1 ) over a scale comparable to the image separation ( 14 ) or an image size ratio @xmath5/@xmath6=1.75 , with @xmath7@xmath860 @xmath9as .",
    "( ii ) ongoing multi ",
    "frequency wsrt total  flux observations ( @xmath16 months ) shows a decrease in the modulation index with wavelength ( @xmath10@xmath112 ) , whereas the opposite trend is expected for refractive scintillation .",
    "if one would attribute all short  term variability to intrinsic source variations , it becomes very difficult to reconcile this with the fact that most short  term variability at 3.6 cm ( 8.5ghz ) is external and not intrinsic . the logical conclusion would be that most short  term variability seen in the wsrt 6cm light curves is also of external origin with a modulation index smaller than that at 21 cm .",
    "( iii ) a modulation index of a few percent corresponds to a variability time scale of less than 12 days for weak and strong refractive scattering , whereas variability over much longer scales is present .      for several reasons ,",
    "microlensing is a plausible source of the external variability of b1600 + 434 : ( i ) because b1600 + 434 is multiply imaged , the lens images pass through a fore  ground lens galaxy with high microlensing optical depths , i.e.  @xmath12@xmath80.2 and @xmath13@xmath80.9 ( kb99 ) .",
    "combined with the fact that many core  dominated flat ",
    "spectrum radio source have superluminal jet components ( vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) , makes it probable that microlensing variability is occurring at some level on time scales of weeks to months .",
    "( ii ) from microlensing simulations ( wambsganss 1990 ) , we find that a static core , which does not vary on short time scales due to microlensing ( i.e. @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 ) , plus a single compact ( @xmath17=25 @xmath9as ) superluminal ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) jet component that contains 511% of the source flux , can explain the observed rms and time scale of variability in the lens images . for image",
    "a , however , we require an average mass of compact objects @xmath10.5m@xmath2 to explain its higher rms variability ( even though @xmath12@xmath19@xmath13 ) . a smaller macho mass would result in less variability , due to the convolution of a finer magnification pattern with the source structure .",
    "( iii ) the decrease in rms variability ( @xmath20 ) with wavelength ( i.e. @xmath21@xmath19@xmath22 ) , seen in the wsrt observations ( sect.3.1 ) , is in agreement with a microlensed synchrotron self ",
    "absorbed superluminal jet component that grows proportional with wavelength , in which case one expects @xmath10@xmath823 , comparable to the observed ratio ( sect.3.1 ) .",
    "we have presented the first unambiguous case of external variability of an extra  galactic radio source , the class gravitational lens b1600 + 434 .",
    "several lines of evidence point to microlensing of a superluminal jet component and not scintillation as the dominant source of this external variability .",
    "this implies the presence of a population of machos in the halo around the edge - on disk galaxy with masses @xmath10.5m@xmath2 .",
    "the fact that these compact ( @xmath235 @xmath9as ) structures do not seem the scintillate remains a problem to be resolved , but might be the result of the assumed simple source structure and/or the idealized mass functions of compact objects . ongoing multi",
    " frequency wsrt and vla observing campaigns should further tighten the constraints on this exciting possibility to learn something about the dark matter properties at high redshifts .",
