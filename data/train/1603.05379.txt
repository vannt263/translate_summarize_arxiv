    "there are many different equivalent definitions of hardy spaces , which involve suitable maximal functions , the atomic decomposition , the molecular decomposition , singular integrals , square functions etc .",
    "see , for instance , the classical references @xcite .",
    "more recently , a lot of work has been devoted to the theory of hardy spaces associated with operators , see for example , @xcite and the references therein .    in @xcite , auscher , mcintosh and",

    "hofmann , lu , mitrea , mitrea and yan further developed the theory of @xmath2 and @xmath10 spaces adapted to a metric measure space @xmath11 with the volume doubling property endowed with a non - negative self - adjoint operator @xmath12 , which generates an analytic semigroup @xmath13 satisfying the so - called davies - gaffney estimate : there exist @xmath14 such that for any open sets @xmath15 , and for every @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",

    "we identify the two different @xmath2 spaces .",
    "the molecular @xmath2 spaces are always convenient spaces to deal with riesz transform and other sub - linear operators , while the @xmath0 , @xmath37 , spaces defined via conical square functions possess certain good properties like real and complex interpolation .",
    "the identification of both spaces gives us a powerful tool to study the riesz transform , littlewood - paley functions , boundary value problems for elliptic operators etc .    in section 4",
