    "pre - cataclysmic variables ( pre - cvs ) are objects consisting of a white dwarf and a late , low - mass main - sequence star .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these objects is that they have already undergone a phase of common - envelope ( ce ) evolution , and are sometimes also called post - common - envelope binaries ( pcebs ) .",
    "initially the binary separation is large , however the ce phase allows a large amount of angular momentum to be lost in the system , and the binary separation shrinks .",
    "pre - cv or pceb stars have not yet reached the evolutionary stage of significant mass - transfer due to roche - lobe overflow when they would enter the cataclysmic - variable stage .",
    "pre - cvs are therefore excellent objects for studying the initial evolutionary stages as observations are not confused by discs or hotspots .",
    "eg uma was initially identified as a da white dwarf ( stephenson 1960 ) and later a binary companion with emission lines was discovered ( greenstein 1965 ) .",
    "the following system parameters have been determined ( see bleach et al . 2000 for details and references ) : the primary is a cool white dwarf at around 13,000 k , with a mass of 0.64 m@xmath0 and a radius of 0.013 r@xmath0 , while the secondary is an m45 dwarf with a mass of 0.42 m@xmath0 and a radius of 0.45 r@xmath0 .",
    "the orbital period of the system is around 16 hours ( lanning 1982 ) .",
    "however , previous work has indicated that the m dwarf might have a larger radius and mass than that for a main - sequence star of similar spectral type ( bleach et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we can use high - resolution spectroscopy to obtain estimates of the gravity in the m dwarf , which would give some insight into the mass and radius inconsistencies .",
    "echelle spectroscopy was taken with the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) on the 4.2-metre william herschel telescope ( wht ) during two nights in march 1998 .",
    "a total of 13 spectra of eg uma together with 9 normal m dwarf stars , ranging in spectral types between m06 , were observed .",
    "wavelength ranges from @xmath14250  9000   covering , much of the red region where the red dwarf is dominant , and also included the na i doublet at 81708220   and the ca ii triplet around 8540  .",
    "the data were reduced using the echomop ( mills , webb & clayton 1997 ) and the figaro ( shortridge et al .",
    "1999 ) packages .",
    "the blaze function was removed from the spectra by normalizing with a polynomial fit to the observed continuum ( bleach et al .",
    "a spectral atlas of eg uma has been produced and is discussed in bleach et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "we have generated a grid of high - resolution ( 0.05  steps ) solar - composition synthetic spectra using phoenix code and the nextgen grid of model atmospheres ( hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , covering the @xmath2 range 25003900  k in steps of 100  k and the @xmath3 range 3.55.5 in steps of 0.5 dex .",
    "the synthetic spectra were rotationally broadened to match the observations : eg uma has @xmath4 = 27.8 kms@xmath5 ( bleach et al .",
    "2002a ) , while the standards have values less than 3 kms@xmath5 .",

    "table [ stellar - params ] gives the best - fitting parameters obtained from the line - profiles for all objects in our programme .",
    "overall the k , tio , ti and fe lines gave consistent results , indicating that this multi - line methods appears to give reliable atmospheric parameters .",
    "for example , our parameters for gl406 agree very well with those obtained by basri et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "eg uma is fitted more consistently by a higher surface gravity than normal dwarf m stars , as shown by the k ( 7699  ) line in fig .",
    "[ k - line ] .",
    "good fits to the core and wings are obtained , as well as to adjacent spectral features , by using the @xmath2 = 3300 k and @xmath3 = 5.5 solar - composition synthesis .",
    "the higher surface gravity indicates either a lower radius or larger mass ( or both ) than a main - sequence star of the same spectral type .",
    "this is somewhat at odds with the bleach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conclusion that the radius is larger than a main - sequence star .",
    "the parameters given by bleach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) would indicate a value of @xmath7 , which is closer to the values found for the normal m dwarfs .",
    "the equivalent widths of the na i doublet ( 81708220 ) in eg uma gives an associated spectral range of m45 , which is in agreement with the previous work of bleach et al .",
    "inspection of table  [ stellar - params ] reveals that this spectral type is consistent with the @xmath2 obtained from the spectral fits .",
    "minor discrepancies do exist , however , between the synthetic spectra and the observations .",
    "the na d lines ( 5896 , 5890 ) and ca ii triplet ( 8498 , 8542 , 8662 ) are somewhat stronger in the syntheses .",
    "the line broadening for the strongest lines is not too well known .",
    "for example , using the van der waals broadening calculations based on the anstee , barklem and omara ( abo ) cross - section data give different line strengths ( barklem , anstee & omara 1998 , barklem & omara 1998 , barklem , piskunov & omara 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , possible non - lte effects may also be important .",
    "nevertheless , the overall fits to both eg uma and the normal m stars are certainly very impressive . in eg uma , however , the na and ca lines are affected by emission ( bleach et al . 2000 , 2002b ) and as such were not used in the determination of the atmospheric parameters .    overall , the m star in eg uma appears to be relatively normal and well fitted by a solar - composition synthetic spectrum .",
    "this indicates that the gross properties of the star might not be too far from that of a normal non - binary m dwarf .",
    "however , several spectral features revealed that eg uma is not a totally normal star .",
    "in eg uma there are several prominent molecular bands which are not observed in the standard stars .",
    "these bands are present in both nights , and in adjacent orders , and follow the radial velocity shifts of the secondary star around the binary orbit , so they are believed to be real stellar features .",
    "they were found at 5972 , 5988 , 6004 , 6020 , and 6132  , and are due to yttrium oxide ( yo ) ( bernard et al .",
    "1979 , bernard & gravina 1983 ) .",
    "the first four bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ yo - bands ] .",
    "the discovery of yo bands in the spectrum of eg uma was totally unexpected and potentially very significant .",
    "yo bands are usually only found in s and the latest m stars ( keenan 1966 , scalo 1974 , wyckoff & clegg 1978 , ake 1979 ) .",
    "eg uma is not an s star because it displays intense tio absorption .",
    "yo typically appears at much lower gravities due to changes in the chemistry from high to low pressures .",
    "therefore , it is found in giants , but not usually in dwarfs .    resolutions to this paradox",
    "are : star spots ( eg uma is an active star , bleach et al .",
    "2002b ) ; a giant secondary ; an extended atmosphere ; or a distorted m dwarf with a low gravity region .",
    "star spots are unlikely because the bandheads would show orbital phase variation , which is not observed .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the stellar surface is inhomogeneous .",
    "the m dwarf can not be a giant because log @xmath8 clearly is outside the range for giants , and also the star would have to remain well within its roche lobe or it would become a cataclysmic variable .",
    "the system parameters indicate that eg uma is not tidally distorted , and its gravity does not change by more than 0.02 dex from equator to pole ( maxted , private communication ) .    alternatively , yo could represent an abundance enhancement of y. this would be expected in a post - ce binary because y , along with ba , sr and rb , are all s - process elements , which could have been accreted during the ce stage .",
    "support for this scenario is given by a strong rb enhancement ( figure  [ rb - line ] ) and a possible enhancement of sr .",
    "however , the ba lines appear to be normal .",
    "line - profile fitting has been used to determine the atmospheric parameters of the secondary star in the eg uma binary system .",
    "the best fitting solution gives a surface temperature of the m star as 3300 @xmath6 100 k and a surface gravity of @xmath3 = 5.5 .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is slightly higher than the average for an early m dwarf .",
    "eg uma is unique among the stars in the sample by displaying yo bands .",
    "these may be explained by an abundance enhancement of y , which would be consistent with s - process enhancement from the common - envelope phase of the binary system s evolution .",
    "similarly , such enrichment has been inferred for sr and rb , but not for ba .",
    "further work is in progress to examine the anomalies in more detail ."
