    "the power released by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is currently interpreted in terms of conversion of gravitational energy to radiative energy by accretion processes feeding the central supermassive black hole ( bh ) with environmental gas .",
    "the triggering , maintenance , and fading of the agn activity , as well as the link of these processes with the physical conditions of the environment , from sub- to super - galactic scales , are still widely debated issues , and keep on stimulating a large variety of scientific investigations . in this context ,",
    "radio galaxies are ideal laboratories , because they offer an edge - on view of both their nuclei and their relativistic jets , launched from the galactic center and reaching up to mpc distances .",
    "the variety of powers , sizes , and morphologies displayed by radio galaxies not only provides pieces of evidence of different environmental physical conditions , but also samples subsequent stages of the source evolution .",
    "in particular , key sources for the investigation of the very first phases of the evolution of radio galaxies are the gigahertz - peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources associated with galaxies and characterized by a compact symmetric object ( cso ) radio morphology .",
    "gps sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) are a class of powerful radio sources ( @xmath3 w hz@xmath4 ) displaying convex radio spectra that turn over at frequencies of about 0.51 ghz ; they make up a conspicuous fraction ( @xmath510% ) of the radio sources found in high - frequency radio surveys , and are optically identified with either galaxies or quasars ; their radio sizes are smaller than about 1 kpc , and their radio morphologies reveal either core - jet structures or mini - lobes embedding terminal hotspots and possibly straddling a central core .",
    "csos @xcite have instead emerged in vlbi surveys as a class of radio sources with compact ( @xmath6500 pc ) and symmetric radio structures , making them resemble `` classical double '' radio galaxies in miniature . whereas there is no debate on the true compactness of csos",
    ", the compactness of a fraction of the core - jet gps sources might be the result of foreshortening of extended radio sources roughly aligned with the line of sight ; especially ( although not exclusively ) in these cases , the gps itself might be a transient spectral state : flux - density variability and polarization studies at different radio frequencies are thus instrumental to the selection of bona - fide samples of gps sources @xcite .",
    "the overlap between the gps - source and the cso classes is however significant : gps sources associated with galaxies are most likely to display a cso morphology , and most csos exhibit a gps .",
    "this overlap is explained in terms of synchrotron radio spectra dominated by the emission of the mini - lobes , and suffering from absorption effects causing the turnover about 1 ghz @xcite .",
    "gps / csos associated with galaxies are thus high - confidence candidates for truly compact sources .    although compact gps sources were proposed to be young objects soon after their discovery ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a widely discussed alternative to the youth scenario was the frustration scenario , ascribing the small source size to confinement by a particularly dense interstellar medium ( ism ) preventing the jet expansion @xcite . because the required ism confining densities are not confirmed by recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the confinement scenario is considered less likely , although it might still apply to selected objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "much observational evidence has instead accumulated in favour of the youth scenario , the most compelling measurement being the detection , in several gps / cso galaxies , of hotspot advance velocities about 0.10.2@xmath7 @xcite , which indicate kinematical source ages not higher than a few @xmath8 years , in good agreement with spectral ageing estimates @xcite .",
    "further evidence of youth comes from the underluminosity of gps / cso optical narrow - emission lines , suggesting that the strmgren sphere of the recently - triggered agn is still in an expansion phase in these sources , and we are thus witnessing the birth of their narrow - line region ( nlr ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the youth scenario is part of a wider evolutionary scenario @xcite , according to which gps / csos would first evolve into symmetric compact - steep - spectrum ( css ) sources , equally powerful but with sizes of about 115 kpc , and then further expand outside the host galaxy to become large - scale , powerful radio galaxies .",
    "the evolutionary link between gps and css sources is supported by their membership to the anticorrelation between linear size and peak frequency ( @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not clear yet whether all gps / csos will eventually become large - scale radio sources , and whether the evolved sources will display a fanaroff - riley type i ( fri ) or type ii ( frii ) morphology , because of the frequency s observational limits in the exploration of this relation for super - galactic sized sources , as well as because of the biases in the surveys from which the distribution of the radio sources in the power - linear size ( @xmath10 ) diagram is drawn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the first systematic studies of the host galaxies of gps sources , conducted in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) bands @xcite showed that they are , as css sources , characterized by luminous masses , brightness profiles , and optical - nir colors more typical of passively- or non - evolving giant elliptical galaxies , than either spirals , small ellipticals , brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , or central - dominant ( cd ) galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "this seems to be consistent with what was found for a sample of friis rather than with the properties of fris , which are preferentially hosted by cd galaxies @xcite , and suggest that gps sources are more likely to evolve , through the css phase , in friis rather than in fris @xcite .",
    "however , the morphologies of the majority ( @xmath560% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the hosts of gps sources show signs of recent mergers and/or interactions .",
    "this evidence , apparently at odds with the passively - evolving scenario , was first interpreted as an indication that gps sources might be associated with the first of a sequence of mergers @xcite , possibly leading to the formation of a bcg or a cd only over time scales much longer than the lifetime of the radio source . in subsequent investigations",
    ", however , the presence of young stellar population in these giant ellipticals was revealed by means of stellar - population synthesis models applied to photometric @xcite and spectrophotometric data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed the similarity , out to @xmath11 , between the luminosities of the gps - source hosts and of the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , which are thought to represent the most massive early - type galaxies , and are often associated with bcgs .",
    "therefore , the properties of the hosts do not provide unambiguous indications on the subsequent gps / cso evolutionary stages .    despite these results ,",
    "population studies highlight the existence of far too many compact sources compared to the number of powerful large - scale objects @xcite . beside the possibility , not easy to justify , that these sources undergo a short - lived activity @xcite , two scenarios prove to be particularly attractive to explain this statistical evidence . in the first scenario ,",
    "the jet activity is intermittent on time scales comparable to the age of the small sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : this scenario , supported by the observations of double - double radio galaxies @xcite , and by the detection of candidates for dying compact sources @xcite , finds a natural explanation in the framework of accretion - disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "an accretion disk operating above a given threshold accretion rate ( @xmath12 ) is expected to experience instabilities driven by the radiation pressure , causing the source undergo alternate phases of high and low activity ; for moderate accretion rates , the duration of the active phases is short enough ( @xmath13 years ) to make the compact source unable to grow to super - galactic sizes , whereas accretion rates close to the eddington limit are required for the development of large - scale sources @xcite . in the second scenario ,",
    "many sources undergo processes of jet - flow turbulent disruption before their lobes can grow to large sizes , either disappearing from the radio sky @xcite or developing an fri - type morphology @xcite , in both cases experiencing a drop in luminosity .",
    "the recent finding that fris smaller than @xmath540 kpc were almost absent in a sample of radio galaxies optically identified in the sdss @xcite seems to suggest that all radio sources begin their life with collimated jets , but less powerful jets are more easily disrupted , as the source grows , in denser environments , leading to the production of fri sources .",
    "further evidence supporting this view might derive from the confirmation that the large fraction of low - power , compact objects with non - fri morphology discovered within a sample of fri candidates at @xmath14 @xcite , are indeed young sources .",
    "the two above scenarios are not necessarily in conflict with each other : for sufficiently high accretion rates , accretion - disk instabilities might partake to the radio - source evolution , otherwise driven by the interplay between jet power and environmental conditions .",
    "however , this picture needs to be further explored .",
    "it has recently become clear that instrumental clues on the evolution of young gps sources may come from the x - ray electromagnetic window .",
    "early detections of gps sources by _ asca _ @xcite triggered extensive searches for x - ray emission from these sources ; thanks to the capabilities of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ , several gps / csos are now known to be strong x - ray emitters @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of this x - ray emission is not known yet .",
    "the best spatial resolution currently available in the x - ray band ( @xmath51@xmath15 with _ chandra _ ) is not sufficient to resolve the x - ray morphology of most gps / csos : thus , the identification of the origin of the x - ray emission in these objects relies entirely on spectral studies .",
    "the components of gps / csos first proposed to be the source of the observed x - rays are the ism of the host galaxy shocked by the expanding radio lobes @xcite , and the accretion disk s hot corona @xcite : both components are expected to generate _",
    "thermal _ x - ray radiation , but they are difficult to disentangle and do not rule out alternative scenarios ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . furthermore , the location of gps / csos on the radio / x - ray luminosity plane does not fully elucidate the relationship between `` young '' and `` mature '' radio galaxies : gps / csos are as x - ray luminous as friis , despite their larger radio luminosity , but they seem to lie on the high radio - power tail of the radio - core / x - ray correlation discovered for fris ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    a way of investigating the origin of the x - rays in gps / csos , and address , at the same time , some of the open issues on the physics and fate of young radio sources , is to simultaneously model the dynamical and radiative evolution of gps / cso galaxies , and constrain the models through the wealth of multiwavelength data currently available .",
    "we recently proposed a dynamical - radiative model that , for the first time , describes the evolution of the broad - band emission of a young gps with a given jet kinetic power , as it expands through the ism of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the model accounts for the radiative contribution of the various agn components , as well as for environmental absorption effects , and predicts significant and complex _ non - thermal _ x - ray to @xmath0-ray emission .    in the present paper , we apply the model to a sample of gps / cso galaxies , with the manifold aim of reproducing their complex radio to x - ray spectra , and constraining relevant source parameters as the jet kinetic power , the accretion rate , and the absorption mechanisms .",
    "new observational evidence supporting the model is also discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_model ] , we briefly review the main features of the dynamical - radiative model we presented in @xcite ; in section [ sec_sample ] , we describe the source sample that we chose for the application of the model , and the relevant broad - band data ; in section [ sec_sedmodeling ] , we show the results of the sed modeling ; in section [ sec_support ] , we present further evidence supporting the proposed scenario ; we discuss our results in section [ sec_discussion ] , and in section [ sec_conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .    a model of @xmath16-dominated universe ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",

    "source - intrinsic quantities from the literature given below were corrected for this cosmology , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we recall below the most relevant features of our non self - similar dynamical - radiative model , presented in @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to the original paper ( and references therein ) for a more comprehensive discussion .",
    "we based our description of the dynamical evolution of a young radio source in its `` gps phase '' on the model proposed by @xcite to explain the expansion of classical double sources in an ambient medium with density profile @xmath22 .",
    "the relevant equations were derived by assuming that : ( i ) the jet momentum flux , which is proportional to the jet kinetic power @xmath23 , is balanced by the ram - pressure of the ambient medium spread over an area @xmath24 ; ( ii ) the lobe sideways expansion velocity , @xmath25 , equals the speed of the shock driven by the overpressured cocoon , with internal pressure @xmath26 , in the surrounding medium ; ( iii ) the kinetic energy transported by the jet pair during the entire source lifetime @xmath27 is converted into the cocoon s energy @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the volume of the cocoon ) at the heads of the jets .    for a young gps source expanding in the central gaseous core of a giant elliptical galaxy , and characterized by age @xmath27 , linear size @xmath30 kpc , and transverse size @xmath31 , we could constrain the model with a number of reasonable approximations : ( i ) a constant ambient density @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 the proton mass , and @xmath34 @xmath35 ) , representative of the inner king density profile of the host galaxy ; ( ii ) a constant hot - spot advance velocity @xmath36 , as suggested by many obervations of csos ( see section [ sec_introduction ] ) ; ( iii ) a scaling law @xmath37 , reproducing the initial , ballistic phase of the jet propagation , according to @xcite and @xcite ( see , however , * ? ? ? * for an alternative scenario ) . under the aforementioned conditions ,",
    "all the lobe physical quantities become functions of two parameters only : the jet kinetic power @xmath23 , and the source linear size @xmath38 .      in the framework of the dynamical model described above , we studied the evolution of the broad - band radiative output of gps sources with the source expansion , for a given jet kinetic power @xmath23 . the magnetic field in the expanding lobes scales as @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 being the magnetic energy density . the electron population @xmath42 ( with @xmath0 the electron lorentz factor ) , injected from the terminal jet shock to the expanding lobes , evolves under the joint action of adiabatic and radiative energy losses , yielding a lobe electron population @xmath43 , characterized by a broken power - law form with critical energy @xmath44 when @xmath42 is a power law , and by a more complex form when @xmath42 is a broken power law with intrinsic break @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 the proton and electron masses , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . assuming that the lobe electrons , in rough equipartition with the magnetic field and the protons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , provide the bulk of the lobe pressure , the electron energy density is @xmath49 , with @xmath50 .",
    "the lobe electrons emit synchrotron radiation , with luminosity @xmath51 roughly constant with time , and energy density @xmath52 .",
    "this radiation suffers then from absorption processes , responsible for the characteristic spectral change across the turnover at ghz frequencies . because the coupling between the synchrotron - self - absorption ( ssa ) process and our model equations returns turnover frequencies @xmath53 systematically lower than those typically observed , and reproduces neither the observed slopes of the optically - thick spectra , nor the @xmath54 anticorrelation , the absorption process that we favoured and implemented is the free - free absorption ( ffa ) .",
    "recent data on compact sources of different brightness appear to be in good agreement with the predictions of the ssa model for homogeneous sources @xcite .",
    "however , this result does not exclude the viability of the ffa models @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that the bicknell et al.s ffa model works well on bright sources , although it does not on faint sources , unless the ratio between jet power and radio luminosity depends on luminosity .",
    "although this scenario might be more complicated than homogeneous ssa , this solution was never investigated either in bicknell et al.s or in begelman s ffa models in sufficient detail . in any case , this issue is not of major relevance for our sample , because we focus on bright sources , for which the ffa model works properly .",
    "in particular , we adopted the ffa scenario by @xcite , which was shown to return reliable turnover frequencies and be a promising candidate to account for the @xmath54 anticorrelation , while relaxing considerably the constraints on the ambient conditions required by bicknell et al.s model . yet following @xcite , we ascribed ffa to the external layers of interstellar gas clouds that have been photoionized by the uv radiation from the active nucleus , and are actually ionization - bounded .",
    "these gas clouds might be associated with the nlr clouds .",
    "the particles of the lobes also produce inverse - compton ( ic ) radiation via up - scattering of both the synchrotron radiation ( synchrotron - self - compton mechanism ; ssc ) and the local , thermal photon fields .",
    "the energy density @xmath55 of the thermal fields was evaluated by taking into account the contributions by a putative accretion disk , producing the bulk of its luminosity at uv frequencies , by a dusty torus , re - radiating the disk s uv photons in the ir domain , and by the stars of the host galaxy , mostly contributing the nir - optical photons .",
    "we obtained @xmath56 and @xmath57 , whereas @xmath58 is independent of @xmath38 for the considered @xmath59 kpc .",
    "the ic scattering of all the aforementioned radiation fields yields significant and complex high - energy emission , from x - ray to @xmath0-ray energies . in gps _",
    "quasars _ the putative direct x - ray emission of the accretion disk s hot corona and of the beamed relativistic jets may overcome the x - ray output of the lobes . in gps",
    "_ galaxies _ these two contributions are instead expected , respectively , to be obscured by the torus and doppler - hidden ; the lobes are expected to be the dominant x - ray source .",
    "we chose to apply our model to the sample of eleven gps / cso galaxies known as x - ray emitters up to 2008 .",

    "a cso morphology characterizes the radio structures of all the sources , although one of them ( pks b1345 + 125 ) is an unusual example of cso , with one of the two jets not being detected at frequencies above @xmath51 ghz . our sample s members have radio power @xmath60 w hz@xmath4 , and x - ray luminosities @xmath61 erg s@xmath21 ; they are hosted by galaxies located at redshifts @xmath62 , i.e. at luminosity distances between 0.4 and 6.6 gpc . the linear ( projected ) sizes of the radio sources are in the range @xmath5@xmath63 pc , thus providing `` snapshots '' of different stages of the source expansion .",

    "in our model , the computation of the theoretical radio spectrum is performed under the assumptions that the radio emission is dominated by the contribution of the lobes , and that each lobe contributes the same amount of radiation .",
    "although the theoretical source morphology is necessarily much simpler than the actual source structure , the above approximations reasonably fit our sample of gps / cso galaxies .    for the selected sources , we thus modelled the radio spectrum as synchrotron radiation produced by the electron population of the lobes , @xmath71 , which represents the evolution of the injected particle hot - spot population @xmath42 . among the possible injection functions @xmath42 discussed in section [ sec_model ] ,",
    "we chose the broken power law @xmath72 , with @xmath73 for @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , the break being fixed at @xmath77 ; a similar spectrum was indeed inferred from the broad - band modeling of the hot - spot emission of the radio galaxy cyg a , and interpreted as the result of a transition between two different acceleration mechanisms : the cyclotron resonant absorption , and the diffusive shock acceleration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the lower and higher lorentz factors of the emitting particles were chosen as @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the emission of this particle population well reproduces the optically - thin part of the spectrum , i.e. the emission at frequencies higher than the turnover .",
    "ffa effects , as those generated by a spray of interstellar clouds engulfed by the expanding lobes and mingled with the synchrotron - emitting gas , are included in the model in order to compute the optically - thick portion of the spectrum , i.e. the emission at frequencies lower than the turnover .",
    "the value of the turnover frequency enters the model as an input parameter ( @xmath80 ) ; the calculation of this value would indeed require the physical and geometrical modeling of the absorber , and thus the introduction of additional free parameters in the model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the combination of the above synchrotron emission with the adopted absorption model returned a spectral shape of the form @xmath81 ( with @xmath82 the luminosity unaffected by ffa ) , and satisfactorily fits the shape of most of the optically - thick spectra without the need of assuming source inhomogeneities .",
    "this feature of our scenario is not shared by the ssa scenario .",
    "ssa effects would return an optically - thick spectrum with slope _",
    "independent _ of the optically - thin slope , and equal to 5/2 for a homogeneous source ; to obtain a flatter spectrum an inhomogeneous source should be assumed .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of homogeneity can also play a role in our scenario .",
    "in fact , our absorption model significantly deviates from the data in the case of iers b2352 + 495 , a source whose spectrum is much flatter than predicted at frequencies below the turnover ; in this spectral region , the source structure is indeed more complex than we assumed ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the spectral fits described above enabled us to constrain @xmath23 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( see table [ tab_par ] ) .",
    "the thermal radiation fields that we considered as soft - photon sources for the ic emission are the host galaxy s stars , the circumnuclear torus , and the accretion disk .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the relevance of the contribution of these radiation fields in the ic process , rather than in carefully modeling the sed of these components .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , we modelled the spectra of the above thermal photon fields as black - body spectra with the appropriate frequency peaks and bolometric luminosities .      as mentioned in section [ sec_introduction ] ,",
    "the properties of gps - source host galaxies are consistent with those of non - passively evolving giant ellipticals : they often display signs of recent star formation as well as morphological disturbances .",
    "nevertheless , departures from our assumption of a constant - density medium for the inner kpc - scale core ( see section [ sec_model ] ) are negligible for any gps - source host galaxy .    as shown by , e.g. , @xcite , the typical sed of an evolved giant elliptical displays a dominant optical - nir hump peaking about 12 @xmath69 m , with peak luminosity of a few @xmath510@xmath85 erg s@xmath21 , and a secondary mfir hump peaking about @xmath5100 @xmath69 m , and a factor @xmath5300 fainter .",

    "mfir data were available for three objects of our sample : in all of these cases , we did not associate the mfir emission with the galaxy , but with circumnuclear dust ( see section [ sec_torus ] ) .      besides the emission from the host - galaxy dust accompanying possible star - formation activity , a putative circumnuclear dusty torus re - radiating part of the uv radiation absorbed from the accretion - disk would also contribute to the total emission in the mfir domain .",
    "most of our sample s sources lack mfir observations and/or detections . in the three objects detected at mfir frequencies , the radio - to - mfir spectra",
    "clearly show that the mfir data lie well above the extrapolation of the synchrotron spectrum , ruling out the jet as the source of this radiation , and suggesting a thermal origin of the mfir spectral component .",
    "these sources are not spatially resolved in this energy window , preventing us to locate the site of the mfir emission .",
    "nevertheless , as we already mentioned in @xcite , hints for the presence of a dusty torus around their agn come from numerous observations of samples of gps and css sources .",
    "@xcite showed , by means of iras data ( 12100 @xmath69 m ) , that the mfir luminosity of gps and css sources is comparable to that of extended sources with similar radio power and redshift , and is consistent with thermal emission from dust heated by the uv emission of the central agn , rather than with radiation from a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "analysis of iso data by @xcite also proved that fir ( 60100 @xmath69 m ) luminosities of gps and css radio galaxies are not significantly different from those of extended objects , and associated the observed luminosities ( on average @xmath89 l@xmath90 ) to dust with temperatures from 2530 k ( warm component ) up to 60100 k ( hot component ) , whose masses are @xmath91 m@xmath90 and @xmath92 m@xmath90 respectively .",

    "<S> in a dynamical - radiative model we recently developed to describe the physics of compact , ghz - peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources , the relativistic jets propagate across the inner , kpc - sized region of the host galaxy , while the electron population of the expanding lobes evolves and emits synchrotron and inverse - compton ( ic ) radiation . interstellar - medium gas clouds engulfed by the expanding lobes , and photoionized by the active nucleus , are responsible for the radio spectral turnover through free - free absorption ( ffa ) of the synchrotron photons . </S>",
    "<S> the model provides a description of the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of gps sources with their expansion , predicting significant and complex high - energy emission , from the x - ray to the @xmath0-ray frequency domain . here </S>",
    "<S> , we test this model with the broad - band seds of a sample of eleven x - ray emitting gps galaxies with compact - symmetric - object ( cso ) morphology , and show that : ( i ) the shape of the radio continuum at frequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for by the ffa mechanism ; ( ii ) the observed x - ray spectra can be interpreted as non - thermal radiation produced via ic scattering of the local radiation fields off the lobe particles , providing a viable alternative to the thermal , accretion - disk dominated scenario . we also show that the relation between the hydrogen column densities derived from the x - ray ( @xmath1 ) and radio ( @xmath2 ) data of the sources is suggestive of a positive correlation , which , if confirmed by future observations , would provide further support to our scenario of high - energy emitting lobes . </S>"
