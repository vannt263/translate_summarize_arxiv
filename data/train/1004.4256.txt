    "it is well known from the recent observations that the standard big bang model of cosmology fails to describe the present accelerating phase of the universe . the model is also pleagued by a time like singularity in the past .",
    "accelerating phase of the universe can , however , be incorporated in a number of ways . a number of models e.g. , models with modified theory of gravity @xcite , models with unusual matters like chaplygin gas @xcite , scalar and tachyon fields @xcite are taken into account to accommodate present phase of acceleration .",
    "there are other models based on mostly non - equilibrium thermodynamics and boltzmann formulation which do not require dark energy @xcite",
    ". only very recently some other models appeared in the literature which discusses cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cdm interactions as alternative to the @xmath6cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , exploring singularity free cosmological models is an interesting area in cosmology and emergent universe scenario ( eu ) is one of the well known choices .",
    "a number of literature appeared which discussed eu model as it was free from initial singularity and the size of the universe was large enough so that quantum gravity effects were not important @xcite .",
    "these models evolve from a static phase in the infinite past into an inflationary phase .",
    "the idea is in conformity with lemaitre - eddington concepts from early days of modern cosmology .",
    "if developed in a consistent manner an emergent universe model is capable of solving some of the well known conceptual problems not understood in the big - bang model .",
    "a model of an ever - existing universe , which eventually enters into the standard big bang epoch at some stage and consistent with features known to us today is worth considering .",
    "recently an interesting eu model has been proposed by @xcite which requires some exotic matter in addition to normal matter as cosmic fluid .",
    "the model has been explored in a flat universe as such universe is supported by recent observations .",
    "subsequently the eu model was taken up to examine the suitability of implementing it in the context of various theories @xcite .",
    "the eos needed for the model proposed by @xcite is given by @xmath7 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are unknown parameters of the theory .",
    "we note that different values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 pick up different composition of matters which may lead to an eu model .",
    "a similar eos was considered in the literature as a double component dark energy model @xcite where the model parameters are constrained from type ia supernova data .",
    "the eos considered by them is basically a special form of a more general eos , @xmath8 ; which may be seen as a realization of chaplygin gas ( with @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "it may be mentioned here that chaplygin gas models were introduced in cosmology as an interpolation between a matter dominated era and a de sitter phase .",
    "later a modified model of chaplygin gas was proposed @xcite to describe cosmological evolution .",
    "for example models like modified chaplygin gas serves well as an interpolation between radiative era and @xmath6cdm era .",
    "@xcite showed that even with @xmath10 such interpolation is permissible and an eos like one considered by @xcite may be considered as a phenomenological realization of string specific configuration .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite developed the eu scenario in a very general way .",
    "once one considers an eos given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , a class of eu solutions is permitted for @xmath11 .",
    "the authors however showed that the above eu solution are not permitted with a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "also , it was found that the eu scenario automatically admitted a composition of three kinds of matter energy density in the universe all having their own way of evolution .",
    "this is certainly an interesting issue keeping in mind that the model has the provision for a large class of possible dark energy and dark matter candidate .",
    "it is thus worth to investigate the viability of such an eu model with the recent observational data .",
    "nevertheless we intend to explore the allowed range of values of the parameter @xmath1 , for @xmath11 for a viable cosmological scenario permitted by observations . to determine the range of values for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a viable cosmological model permitted by observations , we adopt here two independent techniques : ( i ) applying @xmath12 minimization technique on @xmath13 vs. @xmath5 data @xcite . here",
    "we use @xmath14 data points given in table 1 , ( ii ) using joint analysis of @xmath13 vs. @xmath5 data and a model independent bao peak parameter and ( iii ) using joint analysis of @xmath13 vs. @xmath5 data , bao peak parameter and cmb shift parameter .",
    "we explore here the suitability of the model with the help of supernovae data ( union compilation data ) also .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec.2 relevant field equations are obtained from einstein field equation . in sec.3",
    "the constraints on model parameters are determined from @xmath13 vs. @xmath5 data .",
