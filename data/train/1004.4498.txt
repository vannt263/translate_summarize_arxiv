    "also the field dependence in this case remains linear at all angles.,width=377 ]    the primary factors that contribute to the low field mr in these systems are the colossal magnetoresistance effect and the tunneling magnetoresistance if the system has a non zero granularity .",
    "the explanation in the case of a non - granular film lies in the multidomain configuration model proposed by odonnell et al .",
    "@xcite .    at high fields ,",
    "the magnetization is aligned in the direction of the applied field .",
    "but as the field is lowered and then applied in the opposite direction , the magnetization has to reverse at some point . considering that the reversal will be rapid , one would expect a change in resistivity @xmath31 due to colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) given as @xcite@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the switching field ( the field at which the magnetization reversal occurs ) , @xmath34 is the spontaneous magnetization and @xmath35 is the susceptibility .",
    "this change will be seen for a transition in magnetization from anti - parallel @xmath36 to parallel @xmath37 to the applied field . as pointed out by odonnell et al .",
    "@xcite , this simple model can not explain some features in these data .",
    "considering the case when the film is treated as a single domain , the magnetization either flips directly from antiparallel to parallel alignment or it comes to the parallel alignment following a two step process , passing from antiparallel , to transverse , to parallel . when @xmath38 is parallel or antiparallel to the applied field one has,@xmath39 and for @xmath38 perpendicular to the applied field , @xmath40 which is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "below t@xmath19 and at very low fields , one can assume that @xmath42 for a single domain sample .",
    "so in this case the linear approximation of eq .",
    "[ singledomainm ] is correct .",
    "so the cmr below t@xmath19 is a first order expansion in the small parameter @xmath43 about @xmath44 . from these arguments and taking into account that the cmr is linear , the change in resistivity upon flipping of the magnetization from antiparallel to parallel expressed by eq .",
    "[ cmrm ] can be approximated to @xmath45 the single - domain model also fails to explain the deviation from linearity . to overcome the shortcomings of the single domain model , odonnell et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a multidomain - model . in this model ,",
    "the magnetization reversal proceeds via motion of the domain walls .",
    "the resistivity for a sample with the applied field along the easy axis can be written as @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the resistivities of the domains parallel , antiparallel and transverse to the applied field .",
    "now , the mr data is analyzed in the light of the multi - domain model taking into account that [ 110 ] lsmo films show uniaxial and [ 001 ] films show biaxial anisotropy .",
    "looking at the data for [ 110 ] samples at 300 k ( right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ rh110 ] ) , no discontinuous change in resistivity when @xmath48 is seen .",
    "so it looks like that as soon as the field is reversed , the magnetization also reverses . for other angles ,",
    "a clear discontinuous change is seen .",
    "this behavior can be understood by arguing that as the field is slowly increased from zero , the moments align along the hard axis that is perpendicular to the current and as a result , the resistivity increases .",
    "once the field crosses a threshold limit , the magnetization flips abruptly towards the applied field direction .",
    "since t=300 k is very close to @xmath49 for lsmo , it is very weakly ferromagnetic at that temperature . hence it is possible that for fields aligned along the easy axis no discontinuous jump may be seen . the data at 10 k ( left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ rh110 ] ) show large hysteretic loop in mr .",
    "secondly , the transition is not very sharp .",
    "this can be attributed to the deviation from the square hysteresis loop that this sample shows at 10 k@xcite . in this case , a transition is also seen for @xmath50 since at 10 k , lsmo is strongly ferromagnetic .",
    "the r(h)/r(0 ) curves for the [ 001 ] sample reveal some interesting facts as well . if one looks at the data at t = 300 k ( right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ rh100 ] ) , a linear r - h behavior when @xmath41 is parallel to the easy axis ( i.e. @xmath51 to the current direction ) @xcite is seen .",
    "some non - linearity sets in once the applied field direction moves away from the easy axis but the non - linearity is not hysteretic .",
    "the observed non - linear dependence presumably arises from the slow rotation of the magnetization vector with the increasing external field .    the data at 10 k ( left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ rh100 ] ) show some features of first order transition but the explanation is a little different in this case since [ 001 ] samples show biaxial anisotropy .",
    "so , when the applied field is along the current direction at low fields , domains aligned in the direction of the easy axis start appearing . since these domains are aligned away from the current direction the resistance increases . at a particular field ,",
    "the moments switch to the direction of the applied field and one sees the step in the resistivity .",
    "but in this case , the step is also present for @xmath41 parallel to the easy axis that is 45@xmath18 to the current direction .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that for the field to flip completely , it has to cross two hard directions .",
    "so a minimum magnetic energy is required to completely flip the moments .",
    "in conclusion it is shown that the anisotropy energy of [ 110 ] la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 films is larger than that of [ 001 ] la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 films . further [",

    "the data has been analyzed in the light of multidomain model and the behavior seen in [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] samples can be explained correctly by this model .",
    "it is also shown , for both the films the resistivity in the reversible regime is proportional to @xmath52 , with @xmath27 nearly independent of the angle of the applied field for [ 110 ] film which is not the case for [ 001 ] film ."
