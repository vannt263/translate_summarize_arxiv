    "to elucidate the nature of critical phenomena of two - dimensional disordered ising models has been a subject of a long - standing interest .",
    "harris[1 ] concluded from a heuristic argument that the nature of critical phenomena of a disordered system becomes different from that of the corresponding pure system when the critical exponent of the specific heat , @xmath4 , of the pure system is positive , while it remains the same when @xmath5 .",
    "since the two - dimensional pure ferromagnetic ising model is the marginal case , namely @xmath6 , many authors have investigated the properties of critical phenomena of the two - dimensional disordered ising models[2 - 14 ] .",
    "for the two - dimensional unfrustrated random ising models , many authors concluded that the specific heat diverges double logarithmically at the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary[2 - 9 ] , though there are several results which insist that the specific heat remains finite[1,10 - 12 ] .",
    "for the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model which corresponds to the two - dimensional frustrated random ising model , a few results exist .",
    "inoue[13 ] investigated the system - size dependence of the height of the peak of the specific heat at @xmath7 , and concluded that the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat at the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary is most probable in the same way as the pure case .",
    "reis _ et al_[14 ] investigated the system - size dependence of the correlation length at @xmath8 , and concluded that logarithmic corrections do not play a role in contrast with the unfrustrated disordered systems .",
    "they concluded , however , that the specific heat diverges at most logarithmically .",
    "namely , they could not completely exclude the possibility of the double logarithmic divergence of the specific heat .",
    "on the other hand , there exisits the nishimori line , which is defined by the equation , @xmath9 .",
    "( @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , which we put that @xmath11 from now on . ) on the nishimori line , several rigorous results have been derived[15 ] .",
    "particularly , it has been proved that the specific heat remains finite .    from the renormalization group approach",
    ", it is generally believed that , for the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model , there exist two fixed points on the paramagnetic - ferromagnetid phase boundary above the multicritical point , namely the pure ferromagnetic fixed point and the multicritical fixed point[16 - 17 ] , and there seems to be no random fixed point in contrast with the three - dimensional case[18 ] .",
    "( in this paper , we use the word `` multicritical point '' as the crossing point of the ferromagnetic - nonferromagnetic phase boundary and the nishimori line , though there seems to be no spin glass phase in the two - dimensional case . )",
    "the pure ferromagnetic fixed point is stable , and the multicritical fixed point is unstable .",
    "thus , the critical phenomena on the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary above the multicritical point is governed by the pure ferromagnetic fixed point .",
    "therefore , the critical exponent , @xmath4 , should be zero on the whole paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary above the multicritical point .",
    "the fact mentioned above , however , does not make a help to determine the critical behaviour of the specific heat , since each of a logarithmic divergence , a double logarithmic divergence and a cusp like behaviour belongs to the case , @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the specific heat from a new point of view .",
    "we devide the specific heat of a system into two parts , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "( for the detail definitions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , see section 2 . )",
    "the value of @xmath12 is easily found to be non - negative and remain finite at finite temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath13 becomes negative at @xmath14 when the system is frustrated and the ground state has non - trivial degeneracy .",
    "since we can consider that the negative value of @xmath13 reflects the non - trivial ground state degeneracy , it is an interesting problem to make it clear up to what temperature the property persists .",
    "it is noted that in order that the specific heat may diverge , @xmath13 should become infinite .",
    "thus , we investigate the region in the @xmath1 plane where @xmath13 takes the negative value for the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model .",
    "our result shows that the region mentioned above is fairly large in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "moreover , it includes the nishimori line .",
    "namely , the region includes a part of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary above the multicritical point . in that region ,",
    "the specific heat can not diverge .",
    "the present result indicates that the specific heat does not diverge at least on a part of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary near and above the multicritical point .",
    "the result is not directly in conflict with previous results[13,14 ] which insist that the specific heat diverges at most logarithmically at the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary near the pure ferromagnetic case(@xmath15 ) , since the range of the concentration of the calcultions does not overlap .",
    "it is natural , however , to think that the nature of the phase transition does not change on the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary above the multicritical point .",
    "thus , we insist that the specific heat of the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model does not diverge on the whole paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary above the multicritical point , though we can not exclude the possibility that there exists a singular point on the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase boundary which separates the nature of the specific heat .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model on a square lattice with only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the summation of @xmath18 runs over all the nearest neighbors .",
    "each @xmath19 is determined according to the following probability distribution : @xmath20 in this paper , we put that @xmath21 .    the specific heat per bond , @xmath22 , is written as follows ; @xmath23_{p } = \\frac { 1}{n_{\\rm b}}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t } \\sum_{(ij)}[<-j_{ij}s_{i}s_{j}>_{t}]_{p},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the thermal average in a given bond configuration , @xmath25 , at temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath26_{p}$ ] denotes the configurational average at the ferromagnetic bond concentration , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 is the number of bonds .",
    "now , we divide the specific heat of the system , @xmath22 into two parts , @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31_{p}\\mid_{\\{t\\}=t},\\ ] ] and @xmath32_{p}\\mid_{\\{t\\}=t}.\\ ] ] here , we introduce technically , @xmath33 , the local temperature of the bond , @xmath19 .",
    "namely , @xmath28 is considered to be the configurational average of the change of the local energy , @xmath34 , when we infinitesimally increase the correspondeing local temperature , @xmath33 . on the other hand , @xmath29 is considered to be the configuratinal average of the the change of the local energy , @xmath34 , when we infinitesimally increase the temperarture , @xmath35 , which surrounds the local bond , @xmath19 .",
    "it is easily calculated that @xmath36_{p}).\\ ] ] namely , @xmath28 has an upper bound ; @xmath37 therefore , at finite temperature , in order that the specific heat may diverge , @xmath29 should become infinite .",
    "now , we consider the case at zero temperature . at zero temperature ,",
    "the specific heat , @xmath38 becomes zero .",
    "when , there is no non - trivial degeneracy in the ground state of the system , each @xmath39_{p}=1 $ ] .",
    "namely , @xmath40 becomes zero .",
    "thus , @xmath41 also becomes zero . on the other hand ,",
    "when the ground state has non - trivial degeneracy , some of @xmath39_{p}$ ] become less than one .",
    "namely , @xmath40 becomes positive infinite .",
    "thus , @xmath41 becomes negative infinite in this case .",
    "the negative value of @xmath29 at finite temperature may be considered to be one of the influence of the non - trivial ground state degeneracy of the frustrated system .",
    "thus , it is an intersting problem to make it clear up to what temperature the property persists .",
    "therefore , in the following sections , we investigate the region in the @xmath1 plane where @xmath29 takes the negative value for the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model .",
    "in this section , we investigate the region in the @xmath1 plane where @xmath29 takes the negative value by the numerical transfer matrix method .",
    "we have calculated for the lattice size , @xmath42 , at the bond concentration , @xmath43 . in the calculations ,",
    "we take the free boundary condition , and take the configurational average for @xmath44 bond configurations .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath22 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "we can see that @xmath29 takes the negative value in the low temperature region .",
    "we have estimated the temperature , @xmath47 , where @xmath29 takes the value zero for @xmath42 at @xmath43 .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath29 near the zero point for @xmath48 at @xmath49 . from the figure",
    ", we have estimated the temperture of the zero point , @xmath50 .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath47 for various @xmath51 and @xmath2 are shown in table 1 .",
    "the accuracy of the values of @xmath47 becomes worse as the concentration , @xmath2 , becomes small , since the gradient of @xmath29 near the zero point becomes small .",
    "we can see that , at each concentration , @xmath2 , the size dependence of the values of @xmath47 is very small , and the values are fairly large compared to the value of @xmath52 , the tempearature of the nishimori line at @xmath2 .",
