    "now , however , indications of neutrino oscillations from the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit , the solar neutrino deficit and the lsnd excess may prove that our understanding of neutrino physics is incomplete @xcite . this uncertainty in neutrino",
    "physics threatens to destroy the aesthetics of a one parameter sbbn with the several parameters of the neutrino mass and mixing matrix .",
    "neutrino mixing in the early universe can induce effects including matter - enhanced neutrino flavor transformation , partial thermalization of extra degrees of freedom , and lepton number generation .",
    "efforts are sometimes made to crowd the multiple effects of neutrino mixing into a single parameter , @xmath8 , the effective number of neutrinos .",
    "the kinetic equations describing the effects of neutrino mixing in the early universe were first discussed by dolgov @xcite .",
    "larger @xmath9 and @xmath10 accelerate population of sterile states .",

    "both resonant and non - resonant conversion has been used to place constraints on active - sterile neutrino properties @xcite .",
    "several formulations of neutrino dynamics in the early universe evolve the system at a monochromatic average neutrino energy with interactions occuring at an integrated rate .",
    "this approach is appropriate when the time scale of interactions between the neutrinos and the thermal environment is much shorter than the dynamic time scale of neutrino flavor transformations .",
    "however , when tranformations and the hubble expansion are more rapid than thermalization , neutrino energy distributions can be distorted from a fermi - dirac form .",
    "furthermore , such spectral distortions can survive until nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the role of neutrino energy distributions in primordial nucleosynthesis has been discussed since the earliest work on the subject @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has emphasized the importance of neutrino energy distributions on the weak nucleon interconversion rates @xmath14 .",
    "kirilova and chizhov @xcite included the distortion of neutrino spectra from nonresonant transformations in their nucleosynthesis calculation . a time - evolving distortion was also included in a calculation of helium production after a neutrino - mixing - generated lepton asymmetry in electron - type neutrinos from @xmath15 or @xmath16 ( active - sterile ) mixing@xcite .    in this paper we explore in detail the effects on primordial nucleosynthesis of the nonthermal neutrino spectra produced by the resonant transformations discussed in @xcite . the resonant transformation of electron - type neutrinos to steriles can leave a near absence of neutrinos in the low energy end of the active neutrino energy spectrum . we find that this suppression of low energy neutrinos or anti - neutrinos in the otherwise fermi - dirac spectrum alters the neutron - to - proton weak interconversion reactions .",
    "these alterations stem from initial and final phase space effects .    specifically , we find that the absence of low energy electron anti - neutrinos lifts the fermi blocking of final state neutrinos in neutron decay .",
    "in addition , the absence of low energy electron neutrinos capturing on neutrons significantly alters the rate of this interaction . both cases lead to an alteration of the neutron - to - proton ratio at weak freeze out , which is directly related to the produced mass fraction of primordial helium .",

    "several authors @xcite explicitly follow the evolution of neutrinos through the density matrix .",
    "the evolution of the density operator for a two state active - sterile system has been popularized in a vector formalism where the density operator is @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the anti - neutrino states .",

    "this set of equations ( [ masterp],[masterp2 ] ) can be followed for specific neutrino momenta .",
    "an initial thermal neutrino spectrum can be discretized into @xmath33 energy bins . along with the number density evolution equations of neutrinos that do not undergo transformation",
    ", these equations form @xmath34 equations describing the evolution of the system .    here",
    "we assume that the sterile neutrino sea is unpopulated at a temperature @xmath35 ( see ref .",
    "active neutrinos can undergo resonant transformation to sterile neutrinos as the density of @xmath24 decreases with the expansion .",
    "as in the sun , the resonance point is energy dependent .",
    "for example , the resonance , for @xmath36 , occurs at @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the neutrino energy scaled by the ambient temperature .",
    "this resonance adiabatically converts @xmath39 to @xmath40 as long as the timescale of the resonance is much longer than the neutrino oscillation period at resonance , and the resonance position must move slowly through the neutrino energy spectrum ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as the universe expands and the ambient temperature decreases , the resonance moves from lower to higher neutrino energies .",
    "the energy - dependence of the resonance becomes important at temperatures below @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "below this temperature , the neutrinos decouple from the @xmath24 background .",
    "the weak interaction rates of elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrinos above @xmath42 are much faster than the expansion time scale . in this case",
    ", the neutrino energy distributions can reshuffle into a thermal fermi - dirac spectrum before the onset of nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , if the transformation occurs after decoupling , the expansion rate will be too rapid , and therefore the neutrino spectra enter the epoch of nucleosynthesis in a non - thermal state",
    ". this will be the case , usually , when the mass - squared difference between mass eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath11 is @xmath43 .",
    "direct @xmath44 transformation was explored by foot and volkas @xcite as a possible means to allow for a sterile neutrino within sbbn with minimal modification to the theory , and also to reduce the difference between the @xmath45he abundance predicted by the observed primordial deuterium abundance @xcite and the primordial @xmath45he abundance inferred by olive _",
    "_ @xcite . the change in primordial helium production in this @xmath46 scenario , including alterations of neutrino spectra ,",

    "the sign of this asymmetry depends sensitively on initial thermal conditions and can be different in causally disconnected regions @xcite . in the following sections , we address how non - thermal spectra affect the production of primordial helium .",
    "since nearly all of the neutrons present during primordial nucleosynthesis go into @xmath45he nuclei , the production of primordial helium in the early universe is dominated by the abundance of neutrons relative to protons .",
    "the weak nucleon interconversion reactions @xmath53 are in steady state equilibrium at temperatures @xmath54 .",
    "the neutron - to - proton ratio @xmath55 freezes out of equilibrium when the weak nucleon interconversion rates fall below the expansion rate ( see fig .",

    "the suppression of low energy electron - type neutrinos affects the rates of the six weak nucleon reactions differently .",
    "if sterile neutrinos are partially or completely thermalized , they will increase the expansion rate since they will contribute to the energy density of the primordial plasma .",
    "the expansion rate , @xmath59 , is related to the total energy density , @xmath60 and the cosmological constant , @xmath61 as @xcite @xmath62 in general , an increase to the energy density and expansion rate will increase @xmath56 at freeze - out , and thus increase the primordial @xmath45he yield , @xmath63 . the contribution to the expansion rate is not significant for @xmath44 conversion post - decoupling , since the energy density in electron - type neutrinos is just transferred to steriles without further thermal creation of neutrinos ( since they have decoupled from the @xmath24 plasma before the onset of transformation ) .    for the case where @xmath64 , the reactions influenced by the @xmath2 distortion are the forward and reverse reactions of @xmath65 . because of the neutron / proton mass difference , very low energy neutrinos readily participate in @xmath66 . here , the neutrino energy is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the nucleon mass difference , and @xmath69 is the electron energy .",
    "the suppression of low energy neutrinos impacts this reaction by significantly limiting the phase space of initial states of the interaction .",
    "the neutrino energy distribution is accounted for in the @xmath70 rate integral in the following manner : @xmath71^{-1 } [ 1+e^{-e_e /",

    "the deficit in low energy neutrinos renders the integrand of ( [ rate2 ] ) to be nearly zero for energy ranges where @xmath2 have transformed to steriles ( see fig .",
    "[ intnue ] ) .",
    "the reaction @xmath74 is altered by a lifting of fermi - blocking @xmath75^{-1}$ ] at low energies because of the reduction of low energy neutrino numbers .",
    "however , the rate @xmath76 is changed less significantly than @xmath77 and thus affects @xmath56 less .",

    "the spectral cutoff never extends above @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 is not altered by this low energy distortion ( see fig .",

    "the reaction is limited in sbbn by fermi - blocking of low - energy @xmath4 products .",

    "the change in helium mass fraction ( @xmath63 ) produced by bbn for @xmath64 is @xmath94 , while a @xmath81 correspondingly causes smaller a change of @xmath95 @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "if electron - type neutrino spectra are altered through matter - enhanced transformation and survive until nucleosynthesis , they can modify @xmath96 interconversion rates through the availability of initial and final neutrino energy states .",
    "this kind of scenario is realized in @xmath97 matter - enhanced transformations with @xmath98 .",
    "non - thermal @xmath99 spectra will arise in any case where flavor transformations occur near or below @xmath42 between a more - populated electron - type neutrino and some other less - populated neutrino flavor , and will produce the same kinds of limitations on reaction phase space as the resonance point goes from lower to higher neutrino energies .",
