    "@xmath0 tau ( hr 1910 , hd 37202 , hip 26451 ) is a bright be star with an extensive observational history that spans photometric , spectroscopic , polarimetric , and interferometric techniques .",

    "however , as @xcite discuss , a hot subdwarf may heat the outer facing regions of the disk , producing narrow emission lines like @xmath7 .",
    "the absence of such emission in the spectrum of @xmath0  tau suggests that the companion is not a strong flux source .",
    "@xcite rule out a cool luminous giant based on measurements of the infrared flux .",
    "given its brightness ( @xmath8=3.0 , @xmath9=3.0 ) and distance ( @xmath10=128 pc ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to fit the central star and an elliptical , gaussian surface brightness distribution to model the circumstellar disk . to account for the asymmetry we detect in the closure phases , we modulated the elliptical gaussian disk by a sinusoid as a function of projected azimuth or position angle ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this creates a `` skewed '' disk model where the sinusoid causes the brightness distribution to peak on one side of the disk and places a depression in the brightness on the other side .",
    "the intensity distribution on the sky of the asymmetric , elliptical , gaussian disk is given by the following functional form , @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29\\exp \\left\\ { -4 \\ln{2 } \\left [ \\left(\\frac{x'}{\\theta_{\\rm min}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{y'}{\\theta_{\\rm maj}}\\right)^2 \\right ] \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the full - width at half maximum of the major and minor axes of the gaussian disk , @xmath32 is the position angle of the major axis measured east of north , @xmath33 is the amplitude of the sinusoidal modulation ( 0@xmath341 ) , @xmath35 is the position angle of the skew maximum intensity measured east of north , and @xmath36 is the normalized central brightness of the disk . in this parametrization , @xmath37@xmath38 runs in the direction of positive ra ( east ) , @xmath37@xmath39 in the direction of positive declination ( north ) , and @xmath40 .",
    "the shape of the asymmetry can be flattened out to be more boxy in appearance by raising the sinusoid by the `` skew power '' @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . to avoid taking the root of a negative number , we take the absolute value of @xmath43 , raise it to the power @xmath41 , and then multiply that value by the original sign of @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we scale the star and disk contributions by the fraction of their @xmath2-band fluxes ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .    to fit the parameters of the @xmath0 tau model we performed a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization using the idl mpfit rountine developed c. b. markwardt .",
    "for each iteration , we computed an image of the geometric model and computed the visibilities and closure phases at the same @xmath23-@xmath24 coordinates as the data and compared these with the observed values .",
    "table  [ tab.diskfit ] lists the model parameters derived for each epoch .",
    "we present the total reduced @xmath46(all ) for a solution and also break it down into separate contributions from the visibilities @xmath47 and closure phases @xmath46(t3 ) .",
    "the formal 1@xmath48 uncertainties listed in table  [ tab.diskfit ] were computed from the square root of the diagonal elements in the covariance matrix and scaled by @xmath46 . to test the reliability of the derived parameters , we fit the data from each night separately in addition to doing a global fit to data observed on multiple nights at the same epoch . for the 2007 nov data , we decided to group only the 2007 nov 14 ( inner array ) and 2007 nov 19 ( outer array ) data in the global - epoch fit .",
    "we did this to ensure that the number of data points going into the global fit from the inner and outer arrays were roughly equal ( to provide equal weights for each configuration ) . additionally , the data from 2007 nov 14 yielded the best individual fit for the inner array ; the data quality from 2007 nov 11 and 13 was not as good because of poorer seeing conditions . in figures  [ fig.vis2 ] and [ fig.t3 ] , we overplot the model in each panel to compare with the measured visibilities and closure phases .",
    "images of these models derived for 2007 nov 14 + 19 , 2008 sep 2628 , 2008 dec 10 , and 2009 nov 10 are shown in figure  [ fig.model ] .",
    "we note that the @xmath0  tau data on 2008 dec 10 were taken during poor seeing conditions that improved by the time we observed the second calibrator of the night .",
    "the changing seeing conditions will result in larger systematic calibration errors .",
    "we noted a trend of increasing system visibility on all baselines during that night , so we suspect that the calibration will affect the overall scaling of the disk size more than it affects the orientation or axis ratio of the disk . additionally , the 2008 dec 10 data only had one sampling in @xmath23-@xmath24 space , where the other epochs and nights had several observations to improve confidence in the results .",
    "the largest source of systematic error lies in the calibration of the mirc visibilities .",
    "the main contributions come from the photometric corrections for the amount of light in each fiber and errors in the angular diameters we assumed for the calibrator stars .",
    "we estimate that these effects can result in a @xmath110% systematic uncertainty in the squared visibilities . to investigate how this affects the model parameters",
    ", we generated 100 data sets for each epoch where the visibilities on each baseline were altered by a fraction of @xmath4910% ; the values of the offsets were drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution . because the visibilities are correlated across the 8 spectral channels , we varied all of the visibilities on a given baseline by the same fraction . using these modified data sets , we derived a new set of best fit parameters for the disk model .",
    "we then estimated the systematic effects on a given parameter by taking the standard deviation of the parameter distribution generated from the modified data sets .",
    "table  [ tab.syserr ] shows the size of these effects on the fraction of flux in the disk , the major axis , minor axis , and position angle of the disk .",
    "these parameters are the most sensitive to the visibility calibration .",
    "the size of the systematic effects are typically 25 times the formal internal errors determined from the covariance matrix ( table  [ tab.diskfit ] ) .",
    "the systematic errors tend to have a greater impact on the data from the inner array than the outer array .",
    "this is because a 10% change in the visibility calibration will have a larger effect on shorter baselines where the source is less resolved and the visibilities are closer to 1.0 .",
    "across the epochs with reliable visibility calibration ( excluding 2008 dec 10 ) , the fwhm of the major axis of the disk ranges between 1.6 - 2.1 mas ( 0.20 - 0.27 au ) .",
    "the range of variation does not significantly exceed the systematic uncertainties , so we can not conclusively state whether we measure a true change in the outer radius of the disk .",
    "the size in the @xmath2-band is similar to the fwhm of the major axis of 1.8 mas measured in the @xmath50-band by @xcite and is smaller than the 3.1 - 4.5 mas fwhm measured in h@xmath4 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inner array data in 2007 nov 11 - 14 tend to favor a puffier disk , where the ratio between the size of the minor axis relative to the major axis is larger than the ratio derived from the outer array data on 2007 nov 19 .",
    "if this effect is real , it might suggest a polar wind component along the direction of the minor axis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is less resolved with the shorter baselines of the inner array and more resolved with the longer baselines of the outer array .",
    "we plan to follow - up on this in future observations ; the newly installed mirc photometric channels will also improve the visibility calibration and help to discern whether the effect is real .",
    "in general , a degeneracy exists between the size of a circumstellar disk and the flux ratio of the star - to - disk contributions .",
    "this degeneracy breaks down if we successfully resolve the disk and can see the visibility curve flatten out at the longest baselines , indicating that the disk is fully resolved and hence , the visibility amplitude is dominated by the contribution of the underlying unresolved star .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig.vis2 ] , the visibility amplitude begins to flatten out on long baselines that sample projections along the major axis of the @xmath0 tau disk , indicating that we are able to remove much of this degeneracy . from our mirc observations ,",
    "we find that the star contributes on average about 0.55 @xmath49 0.08 of the light in the @xmath2-band . in comparison",
    ", the star contributes 0.41 of the flux in the @xmath50-band @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently measured the near - ir excess flux in @xmath0 tau and other be stars by assuming that the stellar flux dominates in the visible part of the spectrum .",
    "the neglect of any disk flux in the visible will result in an overestimate of the stellar flux in the near - ir .",
    "therefore , their upper limits on the ratio of stellar to total flux of 0.76 in @xmath2 and 0.62 in @xmath11 are consistent with the interferometric results .      the position angle of the major axis of the @xmath0 tau disk changes across the different epochs of mirc observations . for comparison",
    ", we list the model parameters of prior results from the literature in table  [ tab.compare ] ; there is some scatter among these position angle measurements also .",
    "we include here a measurement derived from chara classic @xmath51-band observations by y.  touhami et al .",
    "( in preparation ) that were made contemporaneously with the mirc observations in 2008 .",
    "these position angle variations probably reflect changes in the disk spatial flux distribution in the sky that are related to disk gas asymmetries .",
    "the disks of be stars may develop a global , one - armed spiral ( @xmath52 mode ) instability @xcite .",
    "the oscillation mode appears as a spiral density wave that precesses prograde with the disk rotation and completes a @xmath53 advance over a timescale of a few years .",
    "the progressive change in gas density with disk azimuth is probably the explanation for cyclic changes in the intensities of the violet @xmath20 and red @xmath25 peaks of the h@xmath4 emission profiles .",
    "recent theoretical work by @xcite and @xcite suggests that there is significant vertical motion associated with the spiral arm that might assume the form of a tilted disk that precesses with the one - armed oscillation mode . @xcite and @xcite both argued that precession of the disk tilt is the cause of long - term emission profile variations in some be stars .    the cyclic variations in the @xmath3 ratio of the h@xmath4 emission peak strengths is well documented in the case of @xmath0 tau @xcite .",
    "the evidence relating the @xmath3 variations to the oscillation model is especially striking for the last three cycles when the h@xmath4 emission peaks varied with a cycle time of 1429 days and with the @xmath3 maximum occurring at a reference epoch of jd 2,450,414 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath4 variations follow a cycle where the violet side of the emission line peaks at oscillation phase @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , descends to @xmath56 at @xmath57 when a central , `` shell '' , absorption component appears , then the red peak reaches a maximum at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and ascends back through @xmath56 at @xmath60 where a third central emission peak feature appears .",
    "@xcite argue that these spectral variations are caused by the changing orientation of a spiral density enhancement around the disk azimuth .",
    "they also present evidence for an asymmetry in the disk based on the astrometric shift in the photocenter of the blue and red - shifted parts of the br@xmath12 line measured with vlti / amber .",
    "we collected more recent h@xmath4 spectra to confirm that the @xmath3 variation continued through the time span of the mirc observations .",
    "the spectra were downloaded from the bess database maintained at the gepi laboratory of the observatoire de paris - meudon and they were augmented by two spectra from the university of toledo ritter observatory ( courtesy of e.  hesselbach and k.  bjorkman ) and one from the kitt peak national observatory coude feed telescope ( courtesy of e.  grundstrom and v.  mcswain ) .",
    "all these spectra have a resolving power of approximately @xmath61 or better .",
    "they were transformed to continuum flux normalized versions on a standard heliocentric wavelength grid .",
    "the integrated h@xmath4 emission equivalent width ( measured without correction for any photospheric component ) was relatively constant over this time with a mean value of @xmath62   , similar to the mean over 1992  2008 of @xmath63   @xcite .",
    "we measured a simple @xmath3 estimate as the ratio of the maximum flux excess above the continuum on the blue side compared to that on the red side of the h@xmath4 emission profile , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig.vr ] ( together with the times of the mirc observations ) .",
    "the @xmath3 variation did indeed continue through this period , but the maximum occurred near jd 2,454,505 @xmath64 or approximately 196 d earlier than predicted according to the ephemeris from @xcite .",
    "this trend is consistent with the slow decrease in cycle time noted by @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of comparing the disk position angles from the mirc results with the @xmath3 phase @xmath65 , we set @xmath65 using the observed recent time of maximum but with the 1429 d cycle time unchanged . note that there is evidence of a shorter , @xmath66 d variation in the measurements prior to the @xmath3 maximum , first noted in earlier observations by @xcite , that we will discuss below .",
    "a third , central peak sometimes appears in the h@xmath4 profile near phase @xmath67 that might confuse the @xmath3 estimate .",
    "the @xmath3 measurements presented in figure  5 span the range from @xmath68 to 0.48 , and from a visual inspection of the h@xmath4 profiles , we only see evidence of a weak , central peak in six spectra obtained between hjd  2,454,433 and 2,454,457 ( @xmath69 ) . the stronger @xmath20 and @xmath25 peaks",
    "are well - separated from the low intensity , third peak in all six of these observations , so we doubt that the third peak has any significant influence on this particular set of @xmath3 measurements .    in figure  [ fig.padisk ] , we plot the position angle of the disk measured with mirc and other published interfometric observations as a function of @xmath3 phase @xmath65 .",
    "we list the phase computed for each epoch in the bottom row of tables  [ tab.diskfit ] and [ tab.compare ] .",
    "note that we do not include in figure  [ fig.padisk ] the estimate for 1992 from the work of @xcite since the @xmath3 variations were not as well documented then and the cycle time was probably significantly longer @xcite .",
    "it appears that the position angle did vary with @xmath65 over the last cycle .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the variation yields a mean position angle of @xmath70 , a semiamplitude of @xmath71 , and an epoch of maximum position angle at @xmath72 .",
    "the residuals of the fit are reduced from a rms = @xmath73 for a simple mean to a rms = @xmath74 for the sinusoidal fit , and an @xmath75-test indicates that such a reduction would only occur @xmath76 of the time for random errors .",
    "thus , we suggest that the position angle variations are significant and are probably related to the @xmath3 variation .",
    "we note that the fitted mean position angle from interferometry agrees well with the mean from linear polarization measurements , @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the position angle variations result from a tilt of the disk that is associated with the one - armed spiral density enhancement . a cartoon model for the variation",
    "is presented in figure  [ fig.precess ] that shows the orientation of the circumstellar disk and the density enhancement over the @xmath3 cycle . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the tilt is shown as constant at all disk radii ( for a planar geometry ) , although we suspect that in reality the disk tilt is largely confined to radii where the density enhancement is largest .",
    "the geometry of the projected disk in the sky is described by four parameters : the mean position angle of the disk normal @xmath78 measured east from north , the average disk inclination @xmath79 ( equal to the inclination of the spin axis of the be star ) , the precession cone semiangle @xmath80 , and the time variable azimuth of the precession axis @xmath81 ( measured relative to the line of sight ) . in the thin disk approximation , the projected position angle of the disk major axis will vary as @xmath82 and the projected ratio of the minor to major axes will be related to the time variable inclination by @xmath83 we assume that the disk tilt follows the prograde precession of the one - armed spiral mode and that the disk approaches us in the north - west sector ( based upon the interferometric results ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , we derive from the sinusoidal fit of the position angle variation , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and a temporal relation for the azimuthal precession angle @xmath86 .",
    "finally we set @xmath87 based upon the apparent inclination of @xmath88 ( angle between the disk normal directed south - west and the line of sight ) derived by @xcite from their disk model of the vlti / amber observations .",
    "we next consider the relationship between the disk tilt geometry and the location of the density enhancement .",
    "we place the enhancement maximum in the tilted disk plane at an arbitrary distance from the be star of @xmath89 ( carciofi et al .",
    "2009 ) , and it is marked as a gray circle in each panel of figure  7 .",
    "recall that @xmath90 is defined by the time of @xmath3 maximum when the density enhancement is located in the approaching part of the disk in the plane of the sky .",
    "this relation defines the azimuthal placement of the enhancement . in the cartoon model , the precession motion brings this enhancement almost directly in front of the be star at @xmath57 , which is presumably the reason for the strong , shell absorption feature that appears in the h@xmath4 profile then .",
    "half a cycle later at @xmath60 the density enhancement is occulted by the be star , but we speculate that the spiral arm extension is large enough that some high density regions are still visible and contribute to the appearance of a third emission peak near the center of the h@xmath4 profile .",
    "the azimuthal relation we find for @xmath91 places the density enhancement maximum near the line of the nodes between the tilted disk plane and equatorial plane of the be star , and it will be interesting to see if such a placement will be found in future three dimensional models for the one - armed oscillation .",
    "note that for this location and disk inclination angle , we expect that the photocenter of the enhancement will always be found along the line of the projected stellar equator ( dotted line in fig .",
    "thus , the observed position angle variations result not from the shifting position of the enhancement but from the precession of the extended disk whose tilt is presumably generated by vertical motions associated with the enhancement .",
    "our simple model also predicts that the observed ratio of disk minor to major axes will be smallest around @xmath92 and 0.68 , which is consistent with our finding of the smallest ratio in the 2008 dec 10 data at @xmath3 phase @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 tau has a binary companion in a 133  d orbit @xcite probably means that any tilt of the be star s disk will be modulated by the tidal force of the binary companion .",
    "approximately twice each orbit , a tilted disk will experience a tidal torque in the direction of coalignment with the orbital plane , and this results in a nodding motion that is seen , for example , in the precessing disk and jets of massive x - ray binary ss  433 @xcite .",
    "for prograde precession , the nodding period is @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the precessional and binary periods , respectively .",
    "the predicted nodding period , @xmath97  d , is quite close to the observed @xmath3 modulation period of @xmath98  d discovered by @xcite and which is evident in the recent @xmath3 variations ( fig .",
    "[ fig.vr ] ) .",
    "a lingering difficulty for the precessing disk model is the fact that the intrinsic polarization angle has remained remarkably stable over the last decade @xcite , showing no evidence of changes as large as those seen in the interferometric data .",
    "we suspect that this difference arises in the radial dependence of the disk shape .",
    "the polarization measurements probe scattering radiation from the innermost part of the disk where the disk is probably coaligned with the stellar equator ( the probable source of entering disk gas ) .",
    "the tilt , on the other hand , is associated with vertical motions produced by the one - armed spiral oscillation that attain maximum amplitude at several stellar radii out into the disk .",
    "thus , we suggest that the sensitivity of the interferometric observations to disk emission at larger radii is the reason why the tilt oscillation is detected by interferometry and not detected by polarization measurements that reflect conditions in the inner disk .",
    "the non - zero closure phases we measure in @xmath0 tau imply the presence of an asymmetry in the disk and/or the star light distribution .",
    "in general , the position angle of the peak of the skewed distribution lies within @xmath1@xmath99 of being perpendicular to the major axis of the disk .",
    "however , because there is a fairly sharp transition between the  bright \" and `` dark '' sides of the disk , a small change in the angle of the asymmetry has a large effect on how the transition line intersects the outer edges of the disk and changes the brightness distribution there .    from the model images in figure  [ fig.model ]",
    ", it appears that in 2007 nov , the upper ( north - eastern ) half of the disk is brighter than the lower ( south - western ) half . in 2008 sep , the north - western side of the major axis appears brighter than the south - eastern side . in 2009",
    "nov , the south - eastern side of the major axis is brighter than the north - western side .",
    "these locations agree roughly with the quadrant where we expect to see the density enhancement based on the precession mode ( gray circle in fig .",
    "[ fig.precess ] ) , provided that the spiral arm extension covers a larger area of the disk than marked in the cartoon model . a more sophisticated test of",
    "the one - armed spiral oscillation model would require adopting a more realistic brightness distribution for the density enhancement in addition to taking into account how the be star is occulted by the disk .    in 2008 dec , the disk appears very thin .",
    "the skew parameters ( @xmath33 = 1.0 , @xmath41 = 0.001 ) indicate that the upper side of this thin disk is totally bright and the lower side is totally dark .",
    "this suggests that the disk is tilted slightly toward the upper half of the star , similar to a phase between @xmath65=0.25 and @xmath65=0.375 displayed in the panels of figure  [ fig.precess ] .",
    "given the uncertainties in measuring the cycle length and the time of @xmath3 maximum , this is roughly consistent with our estimate of @xmath65=0.21 during this epoch .",
    "the model image for 2008 dec in figure  [ fig.model ] shows a slight enhancement in brightness toward the north - west side of the major axis .",
    "however , we note that the skew axis @xmath100 deg is almost identical to the disk normal at a position angle @xmath101 deg , indicating that we can not conclusively determine whether the brightness is skewed toward one side of the major axis .",
    "if the binary companion of @xmath0  tau were bright enough to effect our observations , we would expect to see a periodic variation in the closure phases ; the amplitude of the variation revealing the flux ratio and the periodicity corresponding to the separation on the sky ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in table",
    "[ tab.binpos ] , we list the predicted location of the binary companion at the times of the mirc observations based on estimates of the orbital parameters . to compute the separation ( @xmath102 ) and position angle ( @xmath103 ) , we used the spectroscopic parameters derived by @xcite in their table 2 , solution 2 ( @xmath104 = 132.987 days , @xmath105 = 7.43 kms@xmath106 , @xmath107 = 0 , @xmath108 = 0 ) . assuming that the binary orbit lies in the same plane as the disk and that the epoch of maximum radial velocity ( @xmath109 = 2,447,025.6 hjd ) occurs",
    "when the companion is approaching from the north - west , we adopted an orbital inclination of @xmath110 and a position angle of the line of nodes of @xmath111 .",
    "if we assume that the b2 iiipe primary has a mass of 11.2 @xmath5 @xcite , these orbital parameters yield a secondary with a mass of 0.94 @xmath5 . using kepler s third law ,",
    "these mass estimates imply a semi - major axis for the binary orbit of 1.17 au , or @xmath112 = 9.17 mas at a distance of 128 pc .",
    "if the companion is a main sequence star , the secondary mass corresponds roughly to a g4 spectral type with an absolute magnitude of @xmath113 = 5.0 , @xmath114 = 1.5 , and @xmath115 = 0.1 @xcite . using the distance modulus implied by the hipparcos parallax",
    ", this corresponds to an apparent @xmath2-band magnitude of 9.0 .",
    "compared with the 2mass magnitude of @xmath0 tau ( @xmath2=3.0 ) , this corresponds to a magnitude difference of @xmath116 = 5.9 .",
    "it could be argued that we measure a small periodic amplitude variation in the closure phases plotted in figure  [ fig.t3 ] .",
    "however , the data quality is not sufficient to compute a full binary fit . adding a binary component to our skewed elliptical gaussian models at a fixed flux ratio and a position given by the values in table  [ tab.binpos ] , does not improve the @xmath117 significantly .",
    "even though we do not detect the companion , the variation in the closure phase residuals allows us to put an upper limit on the binary flux ratio .",
    "the maximum deviation from the best fit skewed disk model ranges from @xmath74 in 2007  nov to @xmath118 in 2009  dec .",
    "if this variation is due only to the signature of a binary companion , then we can place a lower limit on the @xmath2-band magnitude difference between @xmath0  tau and the companion of 5.3 mag and 3.3 mag , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the expected magnitude difference of @xmath116 = 5.9 estimated from the orbital parameters we assumed .",
    "the observed magnitude limit has interesting implications for the possibility of a hot subdwarf companion .",
    "if we take the effective temperature and radius for the hot subdwarfs in @xmath6  per @xcite and fy  cma @xcite and assume a planck flux distribution , then we would predict magnitude differences of @xmath116 = 2.5 ( @xmath6 per subdwarf ) and 4.4 ( fy cma subdwarf ) , which would probably be detectable .",
    "so if the companion is a subdwarf , it is probably cooler and/or smaller than the subdwarfs detected in the other two cases .",
    "we obtained four epochs of interferometric measurements on the be star @xmath0  tau using the mirc beam combiner at the chara array . by fitting the disk with a skewed elliptical gaussian model",
    ", we determine a full width at half maximum size of the major axis of @xmath1 1.8 mas and estimate that the central be star contributes 55% of the light in the @xmath2-band . combining our results with previous interferometric measurements ,",
    "we observe a change in the position angle of the disk over time .",
    "a correlation between the position angle and the @xmath3 phase of the h@xmath4 emission line variation suggests that the tilt of the disk around @xmath0  tau is precessing .",
    "the tilt could be generated by vertical motions of the gas caused by the spiral density enhancement @xcite as it moves through the disk .",
    "we also measure an asymmetry in the light distribution of the disk that roughly corresponds to the expected location of the density enhancement in the spiral oscillation model .",
    "we plan to continue monitoring changes in the structure and orientation of the disk of @xmath0 tau with future observations at the chara array .",
    "ultimately , these observations can be used to test predictions from one - armed spiral oscillation models ( e.g. berio et al .",

    "<S> interestingly , when combining our results with previously published interferometric observations of @xmath0 tau , we find a correlation between the position angle of the disk and the spectroscopic @xmath3 ratio , suggesting that the tilt of the disk is precessing . </S>",
    "<S> this work is part of a multi - year monitoring campaign to investigate the development and outward motion of asymmetric structures in the disks of be stars . </S>"
