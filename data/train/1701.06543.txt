    "in light of theorem  [ thm : min - ineq - intr ] , it is a natural question to ask what is the subset of @xmath95 obtained by intersecting the set of nonnegative elements of @xmath133 with all half - spaces defined by inequalities @xmath134 as in theorem  [ thm : min - ineq - intr ] . in a finite dimensional space , the intersection of all half - spaces containing a given convex set @xmath135 is the closure of @xmath135 .",
    "things are more complicated in infinite dimension .",
    "first of all , while in finite dimension all norms are topologically equivalent , and thus the concept of closure does not depend on the choice of a specific norm , in infinite dimension different norms may produce different topologies .",
    "secondly , in finite dimensional spaces linear functions are always continuous , while in infinite dimension there always exist linear functions that are not continuous .",

    "define @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "then the inequality @xmath174 is extreme for @xmath164 if and only if the inequality @xmath175 is extreme for @xmath176 .    even though the data in integer programs are typically rational and studying the infinite relaxation  ( [ eq : rf ] ) for @xmath177 seems natural  @xcite , some of its extreme inequalities arise from maximal lattice - free convex sets that are not rational polyhedra  @xcite .",
    "for example , the irrational triangle @xmath5 defined by the inequalities @xmath178 is a maximal lattice - free convex set in the plane , and it gives rise to an extreme valid inequality @xmath179 for @xmath180 for any rational @xmath81 in the interior of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , _ every _ maximal lattice - free triangle gives rise to an extreme valid inequality for @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "therefore , even when @xmath181 in ( [ eq : rf ] ) , irrational coefficients are needed to describe some of the extreme inequalities for @xmath182 .",
    "indeed , it follows from theorem  [ thm : min - ineq - intr ] and from  @xcite that the extreme inequalities for @xmath182 are precisely the restrictions to @xmath183 of the extreme inequalities for @xmath164 .",
