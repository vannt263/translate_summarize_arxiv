    "the preparation of ultracold atomic bose and fermi gases in various trapping environments allows to study important aspects of quantum many - body dynamics .",

    "the description of the dynamics of many - body systems of sufficiently weakly interacting particles is usually based on perturbative approximations that rely on an expansion in powers of some dimensionless parameter that measures the binary interaction strength .",

    "prime examples are given by ultracold gases driven into the vicinity of feshbach - fano scattering resonances  @xcite , lattice - trapped gases in between the superfluid and mott insulator regimes  @xcite , and low - dimensional gases in regimes where the transverse confinement strongly affects the binary scattering dynamics of the particles  @xcite .",
    "ultracold fermi gases have been studied extensively in the vicinity of the bec - bcs , i.e. , superfluid - superconducting crossover  @xcite , and currently attract increasing interest , e.g. , in the context of kondo phenomena in lattice environments  @xcite .",
    "taking into account higher - order classical and quantum fluctuations is important in describing the late - time behaviour of initially strongly perturbed as well as of continuously driven systems .",
    "a quantitative description of the field dynamics in a closed system then generically requires nonperturbative approximations that need to be consistent with vital conservation laws such as the conservation of the total energy and the total particle number . in this article",

    "dynamic equations for the two - point correlation functions are derived from the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action  @xcite in schwinger - keldysh formulation  @xcite .",
    "this approach extends the self - consistent mean - field formulation by including the effects of scattering between particles to the desired order of approximation and ensures the local conservation of the particle density - current vector as well as of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "self - consistency is achieved by invoking approximations on the level of an effective action and obtaining time evolution equations by subsequent functional derivation with respect to the desired correlation functions .",

    "<S> nonequilibrium dynamics of an @xmath0-fold spin - degenerate ultracold fermi gas is described in terms of beyond - mean - field kadanoff - baym equations for correlation functions . using a nonperturbative expansion in powers of @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the equations are derived from the two - particle irreducible effective action in schwinger - keldysh formulation . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the nonperturbative approximation on the level of the effective action ensures vital conservation laws as , e.g. , for the total energy and particle number . as an example , the long - time evolution of a homogeneous , twofold spin - degenerate fermi gas is studied in one spatial dimension after an initial preparation far from thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the fluctuation - dissipation relation shows that , at low energies , the gas does not thermalise . </S>"
