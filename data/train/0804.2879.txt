    "the purpose of this work is to study the influence of a thin material obstacle on the behavior of two - dimensional incompressible ideal flows .",
    "more precisely , we consider a family of obstacles @xmath0 which are smooth , bounded , open , connected , simply connected subsets of the plane , contracting to a smooth curve @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "given the geometry of the exterior domain @xmath3 , a velocity field ( divergence free and tangent to the boundary ) on this domain is uniquely determined by the two following ( independent ) quantities : vorticity and circulation of velocity on the boundary of the obstacle . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that initial vorticity @xmath4 is independent of @xmath5 , smooth , compactly supported outside the obstacles @xmath0 and that @xmath6 , the circulation of the initial velocity on the boundary , is independent of @xmath5 . from the work of k. kikuchi @xcite , we know that there exists @xmath7 a unique global solution to the euler equation in the exterior domain @xmath3 associated to the initial data described above . our aim is to determine the limit of @xmath8 as @xmath9 . as a consequence",
    ", we also obtain the existence of a solution of the euler equations in the exterior of the curve @xmath1 .",
    "the study of incompressible fluid flows in presence of small obstacles was initiated by iftimie , lopes filho and nussenzveig lopes @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite treats the same problem as above but with obstacles that shrink homothetically to a point @xmath10 , instead of a curve .",
    "the case of navier - stokes is considered in @xcite . in the inviscid case",
    ", these authors prove that if the circulation @xmath6 vanishes , then the limit velocity verifies the euler equation in @xmath11 ( with the same initial vorticity ) .",
    "if the circulation is non - zero , then the limit equation involves a new term that looks that a fixed dirac mass in the point @xmath10 of strength @xmath6 ; the initial vorticity also acquires a dirac mass in @xmath10 . in the case of navier - stokes ,",
    "the limit equation is always navier - stokes but the initial vorticity of the limit equation still has an additional dirac mass in @xmath10 .    here",
    "we will show that , in the inviscid case , the limit equation is the euler equation in @xmath12 . the initial velocity for the limit equation is a velocity field which is divergence free in @xmath11 , tangent to @xmath1 such that the curl computed in @xmath13 is @xmath4 and the curl computed in @xmath11 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a density given explicitly in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath15 is the jump of the tangential velocity across @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath16 be a cut - off function in a small @xmath5-neighborhood of the boundary ( the precise definition of @xmath16 is given in subsection [ cutoff ] ) and set @xmath17 .",
    "our main theorem may be stated as follows :    [ 1.1 ] there exists a subsequence @xmath18 such that    * @xmath19 strongly in @xmath20 ; * @xmath21 weak@xmath22 in @xmath23 ; * @xmath24 is related to @xmath25 by means of relation * @xmath24 and @xmath25 are weak solutions of @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "the limit velocity @xmath24 is explicitly given in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath6 ( see theorem [ 5.6 ] ) and can be viewes as the divergence free vector field which is tangent to @xmath1 , vanishing at infinity , with curl in @xmath13 equal to @xmath25 and with circulation around the curve @xmath1 equal to @xmath6 .",
    "this velocity is blowing up at the endpoints of the curve @xmath1 as the inverse of the square root of the distance . and has a jump across @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath28 in @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the dirac function of the curve @xmath1 , and the @xmath31 which is defined in lemma [ 5.9 ] depends on @xmath25 and the circulation @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath31 is continuous on @xmath1 and blows up at the endpoints of the curve @xmath1 as the inverse of the square root of the distance .",
    "one can also characterize @xmath31 as the jump of the tangential velocity across @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of the additional term @xmath31 in the expression of @xmath32 , compared of the euler equation in the full plane , is compulsory to obtain a vector field tangent to the curve , with a circulation @xmath6 around the curve .",
    "there is a sharp contrast between the behavior of ideal flows around a small and thin obstacle . in @xcite , the authors studied the vanishing obstacle problem when the obstacle tends homothetically to a point @xmath10 .",
    "their main result is that the limit vorticity satisfies a modified vorticity equation of the form @xmath26 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in other words , for small obstacles",
    "the correction due to the vanishing obstacle appears as time - independent additional convection centered at @xmath10 , whereas in the thin obstacle case , the correction term depends on the time .",
    "although treating a related problem , the present work requires a different approach .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the proofs are simplified by the fact that the obstacles are homothetic to a fixed domain .",
    "indeed , an easy change of variables @xmath35 allows in that case to return to a fixed obstacle and to deduce the required estimates .",
    "this argument clearly does not work here and a considerable amount of work is needed to characterize the conformal mapping that sends the exterior of a small obstacle into the exterior of the unit disk .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors use the div - curl lemma to obtain strong convergence for velocity .",
    "this is made possible by the validity of some bounds on the divergence and the curl of the velocity .",
    "a consequence of our work is that these estimates are no longer valid in our case , so this approach can not work .",
    "we will be able to prove directly strong convergence for the velocity through several applications of the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem .",
    "we finally observe that , in contrast to the case of @xcite , the vanishing of the circulation @xmath6 plays no role in our result .",
    "the limit velocity will always verify the same type of equation .",
    "we also mention that lopes filho treated in @xcite the case of several obstacles with one of the obstacles tending to a point , but the author had to work on a bounded domain . in this case",
    ", we do not have explicit formulas anymore , and the conformal mapping technique is replaced by qualitative analysis using elliptic techniques , including variational methods and the maximum principle .    the remainder of this work is organized in five sections .",
    "we introduce in section 2 a family of conformal mappings between the exterior of @xmath0 and the exterior of the unit disk , allowing the use of explicit formulas for basic harmonic fields and the biot - savart law , which will be really helpful to obtain sharp estimations . in the third part",
    ", we precisely formulate the flow problem in the exterior of a vanishing obstacle . in section 4",
    ", we collect _ a priori _ estimates in order to find the equation limit in the section 5 of this article .",
    "the last subsection concerns an existence result of the euler equations on the exterior of a curve .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "the main notations are listed in an appendix at the end of the paper .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in what follows we identify @xmath11 with the complex plane @xmath38 .",
    "we begin this section by recalling some basic definitions on the curve .",
    "we call a _",

    "thus a jordan curve is closed ( @xmath53 ) whereas a jordan arc has distinct endpoints .",
    "if @xmath54 is a jordan curve in @xmath38 , then the jordan curve theorem states that @xmath55 has exactly two components @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and these satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "the jordan arc ( or curve ) is of class @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) if its parametrization @xmath42 is @xmath61 times continuously differentiable , satisfying @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , and if @xmath64 for all @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 be a jordan arc .",
    "then the subset @xmath13 is connected and we will denote it by @xmath68 .",
    "the purpose of this part is to obtain some properties of a biholomorphism @xmath69 .",

    "we first study the case where the arc is the segment @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "we can have here an explicit formula for @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , the joukowski function @xmath83 is a biholomorphism between the exterior of the disk and the exterior of the segment .",
    "it maps the circle @xmath84 on the ellipse parametrized by @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and it maps the unit circle on the segment .    remarking that @xmath87",
    "we can conclude that @xmath88 is also a biholomorphism between the interior of the disk minus @xmath89 and the exterior of the segment .",

    "therefore , there are exactly two antecedents except for @xmath95 and @xmath49 . in fact",
    ", we have considered the double covering @xmath88 from @xmath96 to @xmath38 , which is precisely ramified over @xmath95 and @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the biholomorphism between the exterior of the segment and @xmath92 , such that @xmath98 , and let @xmath99 be the biholomorphism between the exterior of the segment and @xmath100 , such that @xmath101 .",
    "to find an explicit formula of @xmath97 , we have to solve an equation of degree two .",

    "therefore in the segment case , @xmath113 and the first two points are straightforward .",
    "an obvious calculation allows us to find an explicit formula for @xmath114 : @xmath115 with the choice of sign as above .",
    "this form shows us that @xmath116 blows up at the endpoints of the segment as the inverse of the square root of the distance , which is bounded in @xmath117 for @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , a mere verification can be done to find that for every @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 even if @xmath120 , and @xmath121 in the same way , @xmath77 extends continuously up to each side of @xmath1 , which concludes the lemma in the segment case .",
    "now , we come back to our problem , with any curve @xmath1 . after applying a homothetic transformation , a rotation and a translation , we can suppose that the endpoints of the curve are @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "lemma [ 2.3 ] allows us to observe that @xmath132 is @xmath130 in @xmath95 , because @xmath161 because @xmath99 .    to prove that @xmath162 is lipschitz",
