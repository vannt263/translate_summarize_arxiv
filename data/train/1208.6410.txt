    "the korteweg  de vries ( kdv among friends and foes ) equation , which reads @xmath4 has been studied extensively since its first analysis in 1895 by korteweg and de vries .",
    "apart from applications as a model for shallow water waves , the kdv equation has maintained a pivotal role in several branches of mathematics .",
    "we here focus on the derivation of convergent numerical methods for the initial value problem where the equation is augmented by initial data @xmath0 .",
    "the problem of analyzing convergent numerical schemes is of course intimately connected with the mathematical properties of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation , which has undergone a tremendous development the last two decades , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein",
    ". we will not be able to discuss this literature here , but only refer to the parts that are pertinent to the current paper .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the implicit finite difference scheme @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are small discretization parameters . furthermore , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote symmetric and forward / backward ( spatial ) finite differences , respectively , and @xmath10 denotes a spatial average .",
    "two results are proven , both for the full line and the periodic case : ( 1 ) in the case of initial data @xmath1 , we show ( see theorem [ thm : h3convergence ] and remark [ rem : large ] ) that the approximation converges uniformly as @xmath11 with @xmath12 in @xmath13)$ ] for any positive @xmath14 to the unique solution of the kdv equation .",
    "( 2 ) when the initial data @xmath15 , we prove that ( see theorem [ theo : main_fully ] ) that the approximation converges strongly as @xmath11 with @xmath12 in @xmath3 to a weak solution of the kdv equation .",
    "an interesting fact , and rarely referred to in the current literature , is that the first mathematical proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions of the kdv equation , was accomplished by sjberg @xcite in 1970 , using a finite difference approximation very much in the spirit considered here .",
    "his proof is valid for initial data that are periodic and with square integrable third derivative , that is , @xmath16 for @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18)$ ] .",
    "sjberg s uniqueness proof still is the standard one , using the gronwall inequality . his approach is based on a semi - discrete approximation where one discretizes the spatial variable , thereby reducing the equation to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , we stress that for numerical computations also this set of ordinary differential equations will have to be discretized in order to be solved . thus in order to have a completely satisfactory numerical method , one seeks a fully discrete scheme that reduces the actual computation to a solution of a finite set of algebraic equations .",
    "this is accomplished in the present paper , both in the periodic case and on the full line .",
    "there has been a number of papers involving the numerical computation of solutions of the cauchy problem , starting with the landmark paper by zabusky and kruskal @xcite , where they discovered the permanence of solitons ( the term `` solitons '' being coined in the same paper ) for the kdv equation using numerical techniques .",
    "however , we will here focus on papers that discuss numerical methods _ per se_.    a popular numerical approach has been the application of various spectral methods .",
    "little is known rigorously about the convergence of these methods . for a survey and a comparison ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "multisymplectic schemes have been studied in @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "there exist convergence proofs for finite element methods for the kdv equation , see @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting schemes tend to be quite different from finite difference schemes derived _",
    "ab initio_.    the numerical computation of solutions of the kdv equation is rather capricious .",
    "two competing effects are involved , namely the nonlinear convective term @xmath19 , which in the context of the burgers equation @xmath20 yields infinite gradients in finite time even for smooth data , and the linear dispersive term @xmath21 , which in the airy equation @xmath22 produces hard - to - compute dispersive waves , and these two effects combined makes it difficult to obtain accurate and fast numerical methods .",
    "indeed , any initial data for the burgers equation that is decreasing in a small neighborhood , will develop infinite gradients in finite time , while the airy equation preserves all sobolov norms while creating many oscillatory waves .",
    "most finite difference schemes will consist of a sum of two terms , one discretizing the convective term and one discretizing the dispersive term .",
    "these two effects will have to balance each other , as it is known that the kdv equation itself keeps the sobolov norm @xmath23 bounded ; from @xcite we know that if @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , then the solution satisfies @xmath26 for @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "this dichotomy between these two effects is brought to the forefront in the method of operator splitting . here",
    "the two equations , the burgers equations and the airy equation , are solved sequentially for a small time step .",
    "this procedure is iterated , and as the time step converges to zero , the approximation converges to the actual solution . in the kdv context operator splitting",
    "was introduced by tappert @xcite , a lax  wendroff theorem was proved in @xcite , and convergence of the operator splitting technique proved in @xcite .",
    "our approach here is a finite difference method which can also be viewed as an operator splitting method .",
    "recently , a semi - discrete scheme for the generalized kdv equation was shown to converge in @xmath28 for initial data in @xmath29 @xcite . however , the scheme analyzed here , which in contrast to the scheme in @xcite , does not involve an explicit fourth order stabilizing term , and we show convergence for non - smooth initial data .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : scheme ] we present the necessary notation and define the numerical scheme . in section  [ sec : smoothdata ] we show the convergence of the scheme for initial data in @xmath30 , while in section  [ sec : l2 ] we show the convergence to a weak solution if the initial data is in @xmath31 .",
    "in section  [ sec : numex ] we exhibit some numerical experiments showing the convergence .",
    "we start by introducing the necessary notation .",
    "derivatives will be approximated by finite differences , and the basic quantities are as follows . for any function @xmath32 we set @xmath33 for some ( small ) positive number @xmath34 . if we introduce the average @xmath35 we find the leibniz rule as @xmath36 here we have defined the shift operator @xmath37 we discretize the real axis using @xmath34 and set @xmath38 for @xmath39 . for a given function @xmath40",

    "we will consider functions in @xmath42 with the usual inner product and norm @xmath43 in the periodic case with period @xmath44 the sum over @xmath45 is replaced by a finite sum @xmath46 .",
    "observe that @xmath47 the various difference operators enjoy the following properties : @xmath48 further useful properties include @xmath49 since @xmath50 ( because @xmath51 ) in the first line , and @xmath52 we also need to discretize in the time direction .",
    "introduce ( a small ) time step @xmath53 , and use the notation @xmath54 for any function @xmath55\\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] . write @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "a fully discrete grid function is a function @xmath58 , and we write @xmath59 .",
    "( a cfl condition will enforce a relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath60 , and hence we only use @xmath34 in the notation . )",
    "we propose the following implicit scheme to generate approximate solutions to the kdv equation @xmath61 for the initial data we have @xmath62    this scheme can be reformulated as an operator splitting scheme as follows .",
    "set @xmath63 i.e. , @xmath64 is solution operator of the lax ",
    "friedrichs scheme for burgers equation , applied to @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 i.e. , @xmath67 is the approximate solution operator of a first - order implicit scheme for airy s equation @xmath22 .",
    "if we write these two approximate solution operators as @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , respectively , the update formula reads @xmath70 the convergence of this type of operator splitting using exact solution operators have been shown in @xcite , with severe restrictions on the initial data .",
    "the results in this paper can be viewed as a convergence result for operator splitting using approximate operators with less restrictions on the initial data , but with specified ratios between the temporal and spatial discretizations ( cfl - like conditions ) .",
    "to show that the implicit scheme can be solved with respect to @xmath71 , we proceed as follows : write the scheme as @xmath72 and hence @xmath73 thus @xmath74 the fundamental stability lemma reads as follows .",
