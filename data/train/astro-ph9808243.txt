    "finally , we investigate the positron spectra at higher energies than have been observed , and identify features that may be detectable by future experiments such as ams @xcite .",
    "we work in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in general , the mssm has many free parameters , but with some reasonable assumptions we can reduce the number of parameters to the higgsino mass parameter @xmath0 , the gaugino mass parameter @xmath1 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath2 , the mass of the @xmath3-odd higgs boson @xmath4 , the scalar mass parameter @xmath5 and the trilinear soft susy - breaking parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the third generation . in particular , we do nt impose any restrictions from supergravity other than gaugino mass unification .",

    "we will also show some typical spectra . in the next subsection",
    "we will then discuss the predicted positron fractions and compare with the experiments , in particular the excess at 650 gev indicated by heat data @xcite .      as a representative energy we will choose the average flux in the energy range 8.914.8 gev which corresponds to one heat bin ( with average energy of about 11 gev ) . in this energy range",
    ", we should be fairly unaffected by solar modulation effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiepvsmx ] we show the absolute positron flux for propagation model b versus the neutralino mass and versus the relic density @xmath29 .",
    "we also compare with the heat 1994 measurement of the absolute flux @xcite .",
    "we clearly see that with our canonical halo model we find no models that give fluxes as high as those measured . however",
    ", one should keep in mind that we probably have an overall uncertainty of about an order of magnitude coming from uncertainties regarding the propagation .",
    "we also have uncertainties coming from our lack of knowledge of the halo structure .",
    "for example , the halo could be clumpy which could easily increase the signal by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the local halo density is also uncertain by at least a factor of 2 ( which corresponds to a factor of 4 uncertainty in the positron flux ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiepvsmx ] ( a ) we see that once we are above the @xmath30 mass , the spread of the predictions is much smaller .",
    "we also see that for heavy neutralinos , higgsinos and mixed neutralinos typically give higher fluxes than the gaugino - like neutralinos .",
    "this is because the annihilation cross section to gauge bosons is very suppressed for gaugino - like neutralinos . for higgsinos , the cross section to gauge bosons is also suppressed , but usually dominates anyway .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiepvsmx ] ( b ) we see that the highest fluxes are approximately proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "this is because @xmath19 is approximately proportional to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section .",
    "the highest fluxes for a given @xmath19 are obtained when the annihilation proceeds mainly to channels giving high positron fluxes and the velocity dependence of the cross section is small ( i.e.  the thermally averaged cross section is close to the annihilation cross section at rest ) . in that case , it is essentially the same cross section that determines both @xmath19 and the positron fluxes and hence the strong ( anti)correlation . when @xmath34 we rescale the flux by @xmath35 and hence the fluxes for low @xmath19 are proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "note that in all other figures , we will only show the models where @xmath37 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiepopt ] we show the positron flux versus the optimal positron energy , @xmath38 , where we define @xmath38 as the energy at which @xmath39 is maximal .",
    "we also show the positron background prediction by ms @xcite .",
    "we see that in many cases it is advantageous to look at higher energies than present experiments do .",
    "again , we see that for heavier neutralinos , the mixed and higgsino - like neutralinos give the highest fluxes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : epcfa ] we show an example of a spectrum when the neutralino mainly annihilates into @xmath40 .",
    "this model is example 4 in table  [ tab : examples ] .",
    "we choose this model as an example to explore the dependence of parameters and propagation models since it has two nice bumps from both primary as well as secondary and higher decays / hadronizations of the @xmath30 bosons . in ( a )",
    "we compare our model a and b with the propagation model of kt @xcite with energy dependent escape time . compared to our model",
    "b , the kt propagation model assumes ( i ) that the diffusion constant coefficient @xmath41 , ( ii ) that there is no low energy cutoff of the diffusion constant ( i.e.  as our model a ) , ( iii ) that the energy - loss time @xmath42 is higher , ( iv ) that the diffusion constant @xmath43 is higher and ( v ) that the disk is homogeneous .",
    "they also use a leaky - box model instead of a diffusion model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : epcfa ] ( a ) , we see that our model a gives higher fluxes than model b below about 10 gev .",
    "this is easy to understand since model a has a lower diffusion constant at low energies and hence the positrons stay around longer and we get higher fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , the kt propagation gives a sharper peak from the primary decay of @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "this is , as we will see in figure ( b ) and ( c ) , due to the different values of @xmath43 , @xmath42 and @xmath17 . at low energies",
    ", the kt model has about the same shape as our model a , since neither @xmath42 nor the exact value of @xmath17 are of big importance there .",
    "the different normalizations at low energies are due to different values of @xmath43 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : epcfa ] ( b ) we show what happens in model b if we change the value of @xmath43 , @xmath42 , @xmath17 or @xmath46 .",
    "increasing @xmath43 reduces the flux at lower energies ( where diffusion is important ) , whereas increasing @xmath42 increases the flux at higher energies ( where energy - loss is more important than escape through diffusion ) .",
    "we actually saw this behavior already in fig .",
    "[ fig : taud ] ( a ) where @xmath47 was shown versus @xmath48 for different values of @xmath43 and @xmath49 .",
    "increasing @xmath17 essentially tilts the spectrum clockwise at lower energies where diffusion is important .",
    "hence , the dip at intermediate energies is more pronounced .",
    "increasing @xmath46 has more or less the same effect as lowering @xmath50 , except at higher energies , where we see a decrease in the flux .",
    "this is merely an artifact of the averaging over @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : feq ] ) .",
    "when @xmath46 increases , the average at a given @xmath52 decreases .",
    "we saw this behavior earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig : taud ] ( a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : epcfa ] ( c ) we show the dependence on the actual halo profile .",
    "we expect to mainly see the positrons that are created within a few kpc of us , but as we go lower in energy ( and hence higher in energy loss ) , the visible region expands . in ( c )",
    "we show the difference between the isothermal sphere and a homogeneous disk .",
    "the isothermal sphere gives higher fluxes at low energies , i.e.  we see the galactic core at lower energies .",
    "if we use a steeper halo profile like the navarro , frenk and white profile @xcite , the flux at lower energies goes up even more .",
    "the dependence on the precise form of the halo profile is never very large though .",
    "it is mostly the propagation parameters that determine the shape of the spectrum .    to conclude , the differences between our models and the kt propagation model are mainly a matter of different parameters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : epcfb ] we show some other typical spectra ( examples 13 in table  [ tab : examples ] ) . in ( a )",
    "we show a spectrum when gauge bosons do nt dominate in the final state . in this case",
    ", we typically get a big wide bump without any special features . in ( b ) , we show a spectrum for a heavy neutralino annihilating into gauge bosons . as in fig .  [",
    "fig : epcfa ] , we see two bumps from the decay of the @xmath30s .",
    "the right one comes from direct decay to @xmath45 and occurs at approximately @xmath53 .",
    "the left one comes from secondary decays of @xmath30s , @xmath54 and positrons from quark jets , @xmath55 .",
    "this bump occurs at approximately @xmath56 .",
    "exactly where the bumps occur depend on the propagation model used . in ( c ) , we show a spectrum of a light neutralino where we have artificially boosted the branching ratio for direct annihilation into @xmath57 to 1% .",
    "typically this branching ratio is below @xmath58 , but if we e.g.  have a large mass splitting of the selectrons , i.e.  @xmath59 and @xmath60 we can find mostly gaugino - like , but also some mixed models with a branching ratio @xmath61 . in this case , the line from monochromatic positrons might be visible and not too widened by propagation .",
    "we find that it is only when the branching ratio into @xmath57 directly is reasonably high ( @xmath62 ) that the line is visible .",
    "we remark that if selectrons and smuons mix , the selectron degeneracy must be less than a few percent to avoid constraints from @xmath63 @xcite , though our model is allowed if the mixing between selectrons and smuons is negligible .      instead of comparing with the absolute fluxes",
    ", we will now compare with the measurement of the positron fraction by the heat experiment @xcite . as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : epbkg ] , the standard background predictions fail to reproduce the observations for all energies .",
    "note , however , that the fit can be made better by adopting either a harder electron primary spectrum or a harder interstellar nucelon spectrum @xcite .",
    "a harder electron spectrum seems to be in disagreement with high - energy electron measurements @xcite and a harder nucleon spectrum might be in contradiction with antiproton measurements above 3 gev @xcite . in light of this , it is therefore interesting to investigate if the possible excess at 650 gev in the heat data can be explained by neutralino annihilations in the halo .",
    "note , however , the the uncertainties in the solar modulation ( even though the charge - dependent solar modulation seems to worsen the fit ) are large and not well understood .",
    "we will in the following entertain the possibility that the standard prediction of the background is correct ( to within a normalization ) and make a simultaneous fit of the normalization of the background and the signal .",
    "we will not include the charge - dependent solar modulation .",
    "a study of the heat data in terms of primary sources from wimp annihilations has previously been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the kt results ( both with and without energy - dependent escape time ) were used .",
    "we will compare with the most recent heat measurement of the positron fraction ( 1994 and 1995 combined data ) @xcite .",
    "the error bars are smaller and the data cleaner for the positron fraction measurements .",
    "the heat collaboration gives their results in 9 bins from 1.0 to 50.0 gev .",
    "as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiepvsmx ] ( a ) , the positron fluxes are typically an order of magniture or more smaller than the heat measurements , and we find that we need to boost the signal by a boost factor , @xmath64 , between 6 and @xmath65 to obtain a good fit .",
    "@xmath66 is hardly realistic , but @xmath64 up to 1001000 might be acceptable given the uncertainties in both propagation and halo structure ( the halo could e.g.  be clumpy @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : epex ] we show some examples of our positron fractions compared with the heat measurements .",
    "the examples are the same as those shown earlier for the absolute fluxes , i.e. examples 14 in table  [ tab : examples ] .",
    "the signals have been boosted by the boost factors given by the best fit .",
    "almost all of our models have the general feature of increasing the flux at intermediate energies as shown in ( a ) .",
    "for some models , where the annihilation predominantly occurs to gauge bosons , we also expect a peak at roughly @xmath53 as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the most pronounced feature , however , is the positron line . even though smeared by propagation and energy loss ,",
    "we still expect a sharp peak at @xmath12 if the branching ratio for annihilating into monochromatic positrons is high enough .",
    "however , the branching ratio is typically less than @xmath58 and the feature is buried in the background",
    ". if the branching ratio is higher , the feature would be very clear as seen in ( c ) .",
    "this might happen if there is a large mass splitting of the selectrons as discussed earlier .",
    "in ( d ) we show a light model annihilating mainly into gauge bosons and as seen , the bump from primary decay @xmath67 can be made to fit the excess quite nicely .    in ref .",
    "@xcite models were found where the low - energy bump from gauge bosons can fit the excess at 650 gev ( as in our fig .",
    "[ fig : epex ] ( c ) ) without having to go to @xmath68 1 tev neutralinos .",
    "they get better fits for lower masses than we do because they use the kt propagation model @xcite which does nt shift features down in energy as much as our propagation does .",
    "we have seen that the positron fluxes are typically at least factors of a few too low to be observable . however , with only a small amount of boosting of the signal ( coming either from different propagation models and/or clumping of the dark matter ) we obtain positron fluxes that can either roughly fit the indication of an excess seen in the heat data or produce features possible to observe with future experiments .",
    "we must be concerned with other signals that might be boosted at a similar level and that might be in conflict with current observations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbarpgac ] we show the absolute flux of positrons versus the flux of ( a ) antiprotons @xcite and ( b ) continuum gammas @xcite .",
    "the antiproton measurement of the bess collaboration @xcite is shown as well as the limit of the high galactic altitude diffuse gamma emission as measured by egret @xcite .",
    "we see that especially the antiprotons are expected to give about the same or better constraints on neutralino dark matter than the positrons . for the models with reasonable boost factors ( @xmath691001000 )",
    "the antiproton flux is usually about a factor of 110 closer to the experimental bound than the positrons .",
    "we might therefore worry about getting antiproton fluxes that are too large when boosting the positron fluxes .",
    "however , even though a factor of 10 might seem to be high , we have large uncertainties involved in the propagation and solar modulation . for the positrons we also have large uncertainties from the energy loss that do nt enter in the antiproton propagation .",
    "changes in the diffusion constant also affect the positron and antiproton fluxes differently . increasing @xmath50 ,",
    "the positron fluxes at higher energies are mainly unchanged ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : epcfa ] ( b ) ) , whereas the antiproton fluxes decrease .",
    "we also tend to sample a larger volume for antiprotons than we do for positrons and different halo profiles and clumpiniess hence enter differently for antiprotons and positrons .",
    "a factor of 10 difference is thus probably within the uncertainties .    for our examples and",
    "boost factors in fig .",
    "[ fig : epex ] , the corresponding maximal boost factors that would not violate the bess upper limit @xcite of @xmath70 gev@xmath23 @xmath71 s@xmath23",
    "sr@xmath23 on the antiproton flux would be @xmath72 = 9.8 , @xmath73 , 3.2 and 10.7 . compare this with the boost factors from our best fits to the heat data , @xmath74 = 11.7 , @xmath75 , 19.0 and 54.6 .",
    "the last two examples , fig .",
    "[ fig : epex ] ( c ) and ( d ) have boost factors which contradicts the antiproton measurements by a factor of 56 but as explained above , the uncertainties are large and we prefer to keep these kind of models anyway .",
    "the continuum gammas are very well correlated with the positron fluxes and of the same order of magnitude below present limits .",
    "the continuum gamma fluxes do nt suffer from large propagation uncertainties , but do depend more on the actual halo profile .    to conclude , it is intriguing that both the positron , antiproton and continuum gamma fluxes for our canonical halo and propagation models end up reasonably close to the observed fluxes .",
    "the correlation is also quite good , even though different uncertainties enter in all three different predictions .",
    "other signals , like direct detection of neutralinos and indirect detection from high - energy neutrinos from annihilation in the sun / earth are not affected by clumpiness to the same extent as the ones from halo annihilation .",
    "both direct searches and neutrino telescopes have started cutting into the mssm parameter space considered here . however , the limits are not completely watertight and we choose to keep all models even though some of our models might be excluded with typical assumptions about the halo density and velocity dispersion .",
    "we conclude that for our canonical halo and propagation model , the positron fluxes from neutralino annihilation in the halo are lower than those experimentally measured",
    ". however , the predictions can easily be orders of magnitude too low due to our lack of knowledge of the structure of the halo ( the halo could e.g.  be clumpy ) . if we allow for this uncertainty we can easily obtain fluxes of the same order of magnitude as those measured .",
    "the shape of the signal spectrum is also different than the background and in most cases allows for a better fit of the excess at 650 gev indicated by the heat measurements than the background alone does .",
    "if positrons from neutralinos make up a substantial fraction of the measured positron fluxes below 50 gev , we usually have some features to search for at higher energies , especially if the annihilation occurs mainly to gauge bosons where we expect a clear bump at @xmath76 .",
    "when the annihilation does nt go to gauge bosons , we only excpect a slight break in the spectrum at approximately @xmath76",
    ". this can be hard to find , unless we have detailed measurements around the break .",
    "if the branching ratio for annihilation into monochromatic positrons is higher than @xmath62 , as can happen if there is a pronounced mass splitting between selectrons , there is a very pronounced feature to search for at a positron energy of @xmath77 .",
    "we also note that our propagation models do nt preserve features as well as that of kt @xcite .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that kt uses an escape time that implies a larger diffusion constant .",
    "features are also shifted to lower energies with our propagation models .",
    "to conclude , there is a possibility to obtain measureable fluxes of positrons from neutralino annihilation in the milky way halo and they can easily be made to fit the excess indicated by heat data .",
    "future experiments will determine if there are features in the positron spectrum from neutralino annihilation .",
