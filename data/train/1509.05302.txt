    "the quest for antimatter has become one of fundamental issues in contemporary physics , astronomy and cosmology since the discovery of the positron ( the antielectron ) in cosmic radiation  @xcite which corresponds to the negative energy states of electrons predicted by dirac  @xcite . based on very general principles of relativistic quantum field theory ,",
    "it is believed that each particle has its corresponding antiparticle of the same mass ( but the opposite charge ) and any physical system has an antimatter analog with an identical mass . indeed , following the observation of antiprotons ( @xmath10 )  @xcite and antineutrons ( @xmath12 )  @xcite , more complex antimatter nuclei such as antideutrons ( @xmath13 )  @xcite , antihelium-3 ( @xmath14 )  @xcite and antitritons ( @xmath15 )  @xcite have been observed . in terrestrial laboratories ,",
    "the antihydrogen atoms have also been produced  @xcite and can even survive for a long time in confinement  @xcite .",
    "recently , star collaboration at rhic reported the discovery of strange antimatter nucleus , the antihypertriton ( @xmath16 )  @xcite , and the heavier antimatter nucleus antihelium-4 ( @xmath11 or @xmath17 )  @xcite in au+au collisions .",
    "the alice collaboration at lhc also claimed the observation of @xmath11 in pb+pb collisions  @xcite . a recent review on antimatter production can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of antimatter nuclei production in heavy - ion collisions is of critical importance for a number of fundamental problems in physics , astronomy and cosmology .",
    "for example , the precision measurement of the mass difference between nuclei and anti - nuclei can test the fundamental cpt theorem for systems bound by the strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "the measured production rate of light anti - nuclei in heavy - ion collisions provides a point of reference for possible future observations in cosmic radiation for the motivation of hunting for antimatter and dark matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the antimatter nuclei production provides the possibility to test the interactions between antimatter and antimatter  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the production of light anti - nuclei in heavy - ion collisions can be used to extract the freezeout information of antinucleons in these collisions , which is useful to infer the properties of a new state of matter , i.e. , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) possibly formed in these collisions as well as to understand how the qgp expands , cools and hadronizes , providing a new window ( compared to the electromagnetic and hadronic probes ) for exploring the dynamics of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the heaviest antimatter nucleus observed so far is @xmath11 , and it will remain the heaviest stable antimatter nucleus observed for the foreseeable future  @xcite barring some dramatic discoveries in space detectors due to some special production mechanism  @xcite or a new breakthrough in accelerator technology .",
    "this is because the ( anti-)nucleus production rate in these heavy - ion collisions is found to reduce by a factor of about @xmath18 for each additional ( anti-)nucleon added to the ( anti-)nucleus according to the measured yields of @xmath10 ( p ) , @xmath13 ( d ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath19he ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath20he )  @xcite , and thus the yield of the next heavier stable antimatter nucleus , antilithium-6 ( @xmath6 ) , is expected to be down by a factor of about @xmath21 compared to @xmath11 assuming @xmath6 production rate follows the same exponential reduction law and is beyond the reach of current accelerator technology . however , a careful observation on the experimental yields of p ( @xmath10 ) , d ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath19he ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath20he ( @xmath11 ) in central au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev from star  @xcite indicates that while the yields of p ( @xmath10 ) , d ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath19he ( @xmath14 ) follow an exponential reduction rate very well , the yield of @xmath20he ( @xmath11 ) displays a significant enhancement ( excess ) compared to the exponential reduction rate .",
    "the coalescence model calculations also significantly underestimate the yield of @xmath20he ( @xmath11 ) although they can successfully describe the yields of p ( @xmath10 ) , d ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath19he ( @xmath14 )  @xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interest to understand the physics behind this enhancement for the yield of @xmath20he ( @xmath11 ) , which would be critically important for the future searching for heavier antimatter nuclei such as antilithium-5 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath6 in heavy - ion collisions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the possibility of direct production of antimatter nuclei out of the highly correlated vacuum has been discussed , which provides a potentially more copious production mechanism for heavier antimatter nuclei in heavy - ion collisions .    in the present work , we propose that the enhancement of the @xmath20he ( @xmath11 ) yield could be due to its large binding energy which leads to relatively earlier formation for @xmath20he ( @xmath11 ) than for d ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath19he ( @xmath14 ) in the heavy - ion collisions . assuming the similar binding energy effects also exist for the production of @xmath8li , @xmath4 , @xmath7li and @xmath6 , we find the predicted yields of these heavier ( anti-)nuclei can be enhanced significantly , implying that although the stable ( anti-)@xmath7li nucleus is unlikely to be observed , the unstable ( anti-)@xmath8li nucleus could be produced in observable abundance in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "understanding particle production in heavy - ion collision at different energy regions is among the fundamental questions in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "theoretically , the microscopic coalescence model  @xcite and the macroscopic thermal model  @xcite provide two important approaches to describe the light cluster production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in particular , these two approaches have been successfully applied recently to describe the production of light ( anti-)nuclei in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", the theoretical formulism for the description of ( anti-)nuclei production in heavy - ion collisions is based on the covariant coalescence model  @xcite together with the ( anti-)nucleon phase - space freezeout configuration described by a blast - wave - like analytical parametrization  @xcite which has been shown to be very successful to describe the hadron phase - space freezeout configuration in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one basic ingredient of the coalescence model is the emission source function , i.e. , the phase - space freezeout configuration , of the constituent particles . in principle , the phase - space freezeout configuration can be obtained dynamically from transport model simulations for heavy - ion collisions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present work , for simplicity",
    ", we describe the ( anti-)nucleon phase - space freezeout configuration using a fireball - like model through a blast - wave - like analytical parametrization  @xcite .",
    "we assume that particles are emitted from a freezeout hypersurface @xmath22 where the particles are in local thermal equilibrium described by lorentz invariant one - particle distribution function @xmath23 given by  @xcite @xmath24^{-1 }    \\notag \\\\ & = & g(2\\pi)^{-3}[\\exp(p^{\\mu}u_{\\mu}/kt)/\\xi \\pm 1]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the reduced planck constant @xmath25 is set to be @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath27 is spin degeneracy factor , @xmath28 is the chemical potential , @xmath29 is the fugacity which is directly related to particle number density , @xmath30 is the four - velocity of a fluid element in the fireball and @xmath31 is the corresponding local temperature . for the phase - space freezeout configuration , instead of using the four coordinates @xmath32 , it is convenient to use the cylindrical coordinates @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) where @xmath34 is the longitudinal proper time , @xmath35 is the longitudinal space - time rapidity , @xmath36 is the transverse radius , and @xmath37 is the spatial azimuthal angle .",
    "similarly , the four momentum @xmath38 is transformed to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the transverse momentum , @xmath41 is rapidity , @xmath42 is transverse mass , and @xmath43 is the azimuthal angle in momentum space . the four coordinate and momentum can thus be expressed as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the one - particle invariant momentum distribution can be obtained as @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "for the particle production at midrapidity in heavy - ion collisions that we are considering in this work , we adopt the longitudinal boost invariance assumption  @xcite . by setting the longitudinal flow velocity @xmath48",
    ", the longitudinal flow rapidity @xmath49 $ ] will be identical to the space - time rapidity @xmath50 $ ] , and thus the four - velocity can be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the transverse rapidity of a fluid element in the fireball .",
    "the above expression can be obtained by a longitudinal boost with velocity @xmath53 multiplied by a transverse boost with velocity @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "if we fix the freezeout hypersurface @xmath22 by choosing a constant proper time @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath22 is independent of the transverse coordinates , then the covariant normal vector can be expressed as@xmath56 therefore , one can obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 is azimuthal direction of the transverse flow  @xcite . considering that the freezeout can happen in some time interval ,",
    "a gaussian distribution for the freezeout proper time is introduced as follows @xmath59 which satisfies @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mean value of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the dispersion of the @xmath62 distribution function .",
    "therefore , the momentum distribution can be obtained as @xmath64    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we parameterize the transverse rapidity of a fluid element in the fireball as @xmath65 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the isotropic part of the transverse flow , @xmath67 is the anisotropic part , @xmath58 is azimuthal direction of the transverse flow which is not identical to spatial azimuthal angle @xmath37 , and @xmath68 is the  normalized elliptical radius \" @xmath69 ^ 2}{r_x^2}+\\frac{[r\\sin{\\phi_s}]^2}{r_y^2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the minor axis of the ellipse , @xmath72 is the major axis , and @xmath73 is the geometric anisotropy .",
    "therefore , the transverse rapidity can also be written as @xmath74 ^ 2}{[r_x^2]}+\\frac{[rsin\\phi_s]^2}{r_y^2}}[1+\\epsilon\\cos{2\\phi_b}].\\ ] ]    for midrapidity region ( @xmath75 ) in central heavy - ion collisions that we are considering here , one has @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and thus the invariant distribution function can be expressed as @xmath78^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 .",
    "one can thus use formula ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) to calculate transverse momentum distribution of midrapidity particles in central heavy - ion collision .      in this work , we calculate light ( anti-)nucleus production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions using the covariant coalescence formulism  @xcite . in the coalescence model , the probability for producing a nucleus is determined by the overlap of its wigner phase - space density with the nucleon phase - space distribution at freezeout .",
    "we consider that @xmath80 nucleons are combined to form one nucleus and the total multiplicity of the nucleus can be obtained as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the wigner density function which gives the coalescence probability , @xmath83 is the coalescence factor  @xcite . by inserting @xmath84 function to conserve momentum ,",
    "the invariant differential transverse momentum distribution of the nucleus becomes @xmath85 the above formula is lorentz invariant  @xcite and the wigner function is a lorentz scalar .    for the wigner function @xmath86 , following ref .",
    "@xcite , instead of calculating it directly using four dimensional coordinators @xmath87 and four dimensional momenta @xmath88 of the constituent nucleons , we calculate it in the rest frame of the nucleus . to do so",
    ", a lorentz transformation is performed to obtain the space - time and energy - momentum coordinates of each nucleon in the rest frame of the nucleus . to determine the spatial coordinates of the nucleons at equal time in the rest frame of the nucleus , i.e. , @xmath89 , the nucleons that freeze out earlier are allowed to propagate freely with constant velocity given by the ratio of their momentum and energies in the rest frame of the nucleus , until the time when the last nucleons in the nucleus freezes out .",
    "furthermore , in order to calculate the wigner function , jacobi coordinate is adopted by a transformation of the coordinate as follows  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the center - of - mass position vector of the nucleus and @xmath92 is the relative coordinate vector . correspondingly , in the momentum space , one has @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the total momentum of the nucleus and @xmath95 is the relative momentum vector .",
    "the determinant of the jacobi matrix is @xmath96 , and one then has the following identity @xmath97    furthermore , we assume the harmonic wave function for all the light ( anti-)nuclei in the rest frame except the ( anti-)deutrons for which we use the well - known hulthn wave function ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "the wigner function of the nucleus can then be obtained as  @xcite @xmath98,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath99 where the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath100 is related to the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of the nucleus as follows @xmath101.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath102 can be determined by @xmath103 . in the case of @xmath104",
    ", one can obtain @xmath105 .",
    "we focus on the midrapidity light ( anti-)nuclei production in central au+au collisions at @xmath106 gev in this work . in this case , there are totally six parameters in the blast - wave - like analytical parametrization for ( anti-)nucleon phase - space freezeout configuration , namely , the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath31 , the transverse rapidity @xmath66 , the longitudinal mean proper time @xmath61 , the time dispersion @xmath63 , the transverse size at freeze - out @xmath107 , and the fugacity of particle @xmath108 .    for proton phase - space freezeout configuration , we obtain the local temperature @xmath109 mev , the transverse rapidity @xmath110 , and a constraint on the combination of the proton fugacity @xmath111 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath107 , by fitting the measured spectrum of protons in au+au collisions at @xmath106 gev for @xmath112-@xmath113 centrality  @xcite . to extract the values of @xmath111 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath107 , we further fit the measured spectra of deuterons and @xmath19he  @xcite simultaneously using the results from the coalescence model ( see the subsection  [ resultsnuclei ] for the details ) , which leads to @xmath114 fm , @xmath115 fm / c , @xmath116 fm / c and @xmath117 . for antiprotons , we assume they have the same phase - space freezeout configuration as protons except the fugacity is reduced to @xmath118 to describe the measured yield ratio @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "table  [ parameters ] summarizes the parameters of the blast - wave - like analytical parametrization for ( anti-)nucleon phase - space freezeout configuration ( denoted as fo1 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that we have neglected the difference between protons and neutrons ( antiprotons and antineutrons ) for the phase - space freezeout configuration due to the small isospin chemical potential at freezeout in au+au collisions at @xmath106 gev  @xcite .",
    "based on the freezeout configuration of ( anti-)nucleons , one can then predict the production of light ( anti-)nuclei using the coalescence model .",

    "we have found that the covariant coalescence model with the obtained ( anti-)nucleon phase - space freezeout configuration significantly underestimates the measured yield of @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) . we have shown",
    "the predicted @xmath20he yield can be enhanced to the measured value by using a nucleon freezeout configuration in which the nucleons are assumed to freeze out earlier than those coalesced into deuterons and to effectively consider the large binding energy value of @xmath2he .",
