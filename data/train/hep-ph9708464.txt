    "the inclusive jet cross section @xmath4 , averaged over a small range of pseudorapidity , is an important object for study because it tests perturbative qcd at the highest @xmath5 scale currently possible @xcite . beyond its potential for detecting physics beyond the standard model or confirming qcd , the jet cross section is even beginning to play a role in the global data fitting used to measure parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to carefully consider all systematic effects that influence the interpretation of the measurement .    among those effects",
    "is the `` underlying event '' generated by spectator interactions that can occur concurrently with a major parton - parton collision , due to the extended composite structure of the colliding hadrons .",
    "simulations such as the herwig monte carlo @xcite include a `` soft '' underlying event that is modeled by a parametrization of minimum bias data .",
    "however , there may also be a _",
    "hard _ underlying event : particles can be created by incoherent parton - parton interactions at momentum transfers that are sufficiently large for perturbative qcd to be a useful approximation , but much smaller than that of the interaction mainly responsible for a given high @xmath2 jet event .",
    "attempts have been made in the past to predict underlying event contributions , including the perturbative part that is the focus of our attention @xcite .",
    "we make a new estimate here , based on a recent direct measurement @xcite of the rate for double parton interactions in hard scattering . in the following sections we derive the prediction ,",
    "show how it can be independently tested by experiment , and discuss its effect on the inclusive cross section .",
    "to generate typical semi - hard perturbative final states , herwig 5.8 @xcite was used to simulate qcd @xmath6 hard scattering at the tevatron energy @xmath7 , with the minimum @xmath8 parameter set to a fairly small value ptmin@xmath9 that is nevertheless large enough for comfort with the perturbative calculation .",
    "this choice yields a cross section @xmath10 , which is approximately equal to the full inelastic non - diffractive cross section @xcite , so we appear to be taking an extreme point of view in which that cross section is mainly generated by perturbative ( `` minijet '' ) interactions .",
    "the point of view is actually not so extreme , since including @xmath11-channel unitarity effects , e.g. , by an eikonal model , would substantially reduce the cross section on the basis that once one interaction has taken place , additional interactions do not really add to the inelastic cross section @xcite .",
    "the soft underlying event feature of herwig was turned off ( prsof@xmath12 ) , since our goal is to study the perturbative part of the underlying event .",
    "if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are cross sections for distinguishable rare parton - parton interactions , the cross section for both interactions to occur in the same event can be written as @xmath15 with the parameter @xmath16 conveying the probability for double parton interaction .",
    "@xmath16 carries nonperturbative information beyond the scope of ordinary parton distribution functions , since it relates to correlations between partons within a single hadron .",
    "it has recently been measured to be @xmath17 @xcite .    for a fixed small value of @xmath13 , corresponding to some rare hard scattering of type 1 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) gives @xmath18 as the probability for a second rare scattering of type 2 . if this type 2 scattering is not rare , and it occurs randomly , the obvious generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is a poisson distribution in the number @xmath19 of type 2 interactions that accompany a given type 1 interaction : @xmath20 with mean number @xmath21",
    ".    our model for the hard underlying event therefore consists of superimposing @xmath19 of the above minijet events from herwig , with a poisson probability distribution ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) of mean @xmath22 . in doing this ,",
    "we ignore energy - momentum conservation effects in the sense that the parton momentum distributions are taken to be the same as in single - interaction events .",
    "this assumption should be adequate because the minijet interactions do nt require a great deal of energy , and thus come from partons at rather small @xmath23 .",
    "( more elaborate models @xcite based on pythia @xcite , and @xcite based on herwig , have incorporated these energy - momentum constraints . )",
    "meanwhile , the poisson assumption could actually _ underestimate _ the frequency of 3 or more interactions , since these may be enhanced by `` hot spots ''  e.g. , by strong spatial correlations between the partons in a beam or target hadron associated with constituent quarks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus specifically the case of the underlying event in dijet production",
    ". however , it will be valuable to look also at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or lepton pair production , where the hard scattering makes a color - neutral object , so there is no radiation associated with final state jets .",
    "these processes also share the advantage that the hard scattering is initiated by @xmath26 , which generates less radiation than @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "single jet final states such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 should also be studied .",
    "we generate events with jets of transverse energy @xmath31 using herwig , and look at the total transverse energy inside a control region cone @xmath32 , which is the size typically used to define jets in the pseudorapidity  azimuthal angle `` lego '' plane .",
    "the underlying event is by definition uncorrelated with the jets , so to avoid the majority of the jet @xmath2 , the control cone is centered a distance @xmath33 away from both jet axes , in a manner to be described fully in sect .",
    "[ sec : observing ] .",
    "1 shows the distribution of transverse energy @xmath2 in the control region cone from the herwig soft underlying event ( dashed curve ) and from the hard underlying event model ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the average values , which are relevant for the correction to the inclusive jet cross section as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : inclusive ] , are @xmath34 for the soft background and @xmath35 for the hard background . for comparison ,",
    "1 also shows the predicted contribution from radiation associated with the hard scattering ( solid curve ) , as given by herwig with the underlying event turned off .",
    "it has @xmath36 .",
    "the hard underlying event model predicts a substantially larger @xmath37 than the herwig soft model .",
    "taken as estimates of the average underlying event @xmath2 that should be added to a perturbative qcd calculation to predict the observed inclusive jet cross section , the difference is significant as will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : inclusive ]  the more so if both mechanisms operate concurrently , so their contributions to @xmath2 should be added .    before turning to the influence on inclusive jet cross sections , we first consider how to measure the background event better .",
    "an obvious way to measure the background event contribution to jets is to look at the @xmath2 distribution in a `` control region '' cone of the same radius that is used to identify jets , as discussed in the preceeding section .",
    "2 shows the predicted probability distributions , which correspond to adding the contributions described by fig .  1 : herwig with its soft underlying event model included ( dashed curve ) , herwig with its soft underlying event portion replaced by the hard underlying event model of sect .",
    "[ sec : hue ] ( dotted curve ) , and herwig with both underlying event models operative ( solid curve ) .",
    "all three curves share contributions from the substantial qcd radiation generated by the principal hard scattering and its color connections to the beam particles .",
    "this makes the curves somewhat similar , but the differences are large enough that a measurement of this control @xmath2 distribution would give a useful indication of the background event level .    to measure the underlying event more accurately ,",
    "we generalize a technique first advocated by marchesini and webber @xcite  which has apparently not yet been tried experimentally in its original form .",
    "the essence of the technique is to study @xmath2 simultaneously in two regions that are separate from each other and separate from any jets that define the final state under study .",
    "we describe the proposed generalization in the context of our application to dijet events .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the locations of the jets in the lego plane .",
    "for this study , we make the approximation that the jets are back - to - back in azimuth : @xmath40 .",
    "label the jets so that @xmath41 and let @xmath42 - 1/4 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rejecting the small fraction ( @xmath43 ) of events that have @xmath44 , for which @xmath45 is undefined .",
    "then consider the two points @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 these points are at the same pseudorapidity @xmath49 , and are well separated from each other in azimuth by @xmath50 which varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "both points are separated from both of the jet axes by a distance of exactly @xmath53 in the lego plane .",
    "( the jet that lies farther from them in @xmath54 is therefore closer to them in @xmath55 . )",
    "we can define a similar pair of points by letting @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq5 ] ) . for the present purpose ,",
    "we use only the pair of points with @xmath49 closer to @xmath58 to reduce any kinematic suppression .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the total transverse energy @xmath2 deposited in cones of radius @xmath61 centered on these two points .",
    "3 shows some typical locations of the cones with respect to the jet axes . from the herwig simulation",
    "( taking the jet axes from the directions of their partons , without modification by initial state radiation for simplicity ) , we find @xmath62 for the mean and standard deviation in @xmath54 and @xmath63 for the mean and standard deviation in @xmath64 .",
    "( in practice , it may be better to keep the control cones centered at fixed values of @xmath54 , at the expense of letting their distances from the jets vary somewhat , to avoid effects due to the @xmath54-dependence of detector corrections . )",
    "the cones @xmath65 and @xmath66 are those already used in sect .",
    "[ sec : hue ] to study the underlying event background .",
    "the two cones are equivalent , and only one was used for each event .",
    "2 can therefore be interpreted as the probability distribution for @xmath59 or equivalently for @xmath60 .",
    "because there is no intrinsic difference between the two control cones , averaging over events would give @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that @xmath68 where @xmath69 this separation into @xmath70 and @xmath71 is useful , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , because next - to - leading order perturbative corrections to the principal hard scattering contribute in at most one of the two regions , and hence contribute only to @xmath70 ; while the underlying event ( like minimum bias events @xcite ) is expected to have positive correlations over long distances in @xmath72 , so its contribution to @xmath70 is suppressed while its contribution to @xmath71 is strong . thus measuring the distributions of @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "separately will be much more revealing than the distribution of @xmath59 or @xmath60 of fig .  2 alone .",
    "4 shows the predicted probability distributions for @xmath70 .",
    "as anticipated above , @xmath70 is not very sensitive to the choice of model for the underlying event . testing this distribution against experiment",
    "would therefore be a good way to test qcd in a manner that is not very sensitive to underlying event effects .",
    "5 shows predicted probability distributions for @xmath71 .",
    "as anticipated above , @xmath71 is _ very _ sensitive to the underlying event model . testing this distribution against experiment",
    "would therefore be an excellent way to measure the strength of the underlying event .",
    "the method of marchesini and webber @xcite could be generalized further in the hunt for the background .",
    "for example , the transverse energy could be measured in all four of the control regions that can be defined by @xmath73 cones centered @xmath53 units in @xmath72 from both jets .",
    "these regions are shown in fig .  3 for jets that are back - to - back in @xmath55 .",
    "the distribution of the minimum of the four transverse energies , or the distribution of the sum of the two smaller ones , would be especially sensitive to the underlying event .",
    "other cone sizes would also be of interest , but @xmath73 applies most directly to the correction to the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "the influence of the underlying event on the inclusive jet cross section is calculated as follows .",
    "let @xmath74 be the single hard scattering contribution to the jet cross section , which is predicted by standard pqcd techniques on the basis of parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 be the probability distribution for additional @xmath2 inside the jet cone contributed by the underlying event , normalized to @xmath76 .",
    "the observable jet @xmath2 is the total of the two contributions , so the observable inclusive cross section is given by @xmath77 it is assumed here that the underlying event contribution is small enough not to significantly shift the apparent jet axis .",
    "in practice there would be a small additional increase in the average jet energy due to the jet - finding algorithm s tendency to maximize the @xmath2 included in the jet .",
    "6 shows the fractional increase in the inclusive jet cross section caused by the herwig soft background event ( dashed curve ) ; by the hard underlying event model of sect .",
    "[ sec : hue ] ( dotted curve ) ; or by including both underlying event models ( dot - dash curve ) .",
    "the effect of the underlying event is rather large at the lower values of jet @xmath2 , so it must be measured rather well before a meaningful comparison can be made between the observed jet cross section and the pqcd prediction .",
    "the effect of the underlying event is significant even at the highest jet @xmath2 shown , where the cross section is raised by approximately @xmath78 , @xmath79 , or @xmath80 under these three assumptions .",
    "the fractional increase caused by adding the hard underlying event to the prediction with the soft underlying event already included is shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "it is nearly identical to the the increase caused by adding it to the pqcd prediction alone ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the procedure used by experimenters @xcite to take account of the underlying event , along with background from simultaneous events ( `` pile - up '' ) , is to subtract a constant value from each measured jet @xmath2 .",
    "we examine the accuracy of that approach next .",
    "an average underlying event contribution @xmath81 can be defined by the exact equation @xmath82 since @xmath83 falls rapidly with @xmath84 , it is natural to make a linear expansion of @xmath85 in the neighborhood of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq11 ] ) . the underlying event contribution",
    "is then given by @xmath86 which corresponds to the experimental procedure of approximating the background contribution in each event by the average value .",
    "this average is subtracted from each measured jet @xmath2 before obtaining the inclusive cross section that is compared with pqcd .",
    "the value used is @xmath87 , which is similar to the herwig soft background prediction @xmath34 found above .",
    "it corresponds to an underlying event level of @xmath88 per unit area in @xmath72 .",
    "i find that the linear approximation works rather well for the models considered here , even in the most extreme case where both soft and hard background are included .",
    "for example , in that case @xmath89 , while the true effect corresponds to @xmath90 for jets of @xmath91 .",
    "however , in real experiments , there is a further background from true minimum bias collisions that occur between other @xmath92 pairs at high luminosity .",
    "this can easily raise the background level to the point where the linear approximation breaks down . in that case",
    ", the cdf analysis method @xcite of parametrizing @xmath93 and fitting the parameters to the experimental results , which is useful to unfold other detector effects anyway , can include this one as well .",
    "the essential need is to allow for the event - to - event fluctuations in background .    in the linear approximation ,",
    "the fractional effect on the inclusive cross section can be written in the form @xmath94 where @xmath19 is the local effective power law defined by @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 over the range @xmath97 , @xmath98 rises from @xmath99 to @xmath100 . its large value , which represents the rapid fall of the inclusive cross section with @xmath2 , enhances the effect of the background according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq14 ] ) , as has been emphasized recently @xcite . for example , it implies that an additional @xmath101@xmath0 gev of background @xmath2 , which may be present by the mechanism of sect .",
    "[ sec : hue ] , will raise the inclusive cross section by @xmath1@xmath79 at @xmath102 , which is consistent with fig .",
    "the point of this paper is that the inclusive jet cross section may contain an underlying event contribution that is @xmath101@xmath103 larger than generally assumed , due to incoherent multiple semi - hard interactions that accompany the hard scattering .",
    "the calculation presented here is less elaborate than previous methods of assessing these multiparton interactions @xcite , but it has the advantage of being constrained by a recent measurement of the double parton interaction rate @xcite .    in view of the importance of the inclusive jet cross section ,",
    "it is urgent to settle the question of underlying event level definitively by measuring it as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : observing ] .",
    "this will also serve as a test of the assumptions used to make the estimate , which involve interesting unexplored areas of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "we have focused on @xmath2 in an @xmath104 cone , because that is the relevant quantity for estimating the incoherent background under a jet .",
    "the background will also have an important influence on `` jet shape '' observables such as the cone size dependence @xmath105 @xcite . to study the underlying event mechanism in more detail",
    ", it would be useful to apply the technique based on marchesini and webber @xcite that is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : observing ] using regions of different sizes as well",
