    "thanks to a number of recent space missions , culminating with the _ herschel space observatory _ , an enormous step forward has been made in our understanding of where water is formed in space , what its abundance is in various physical environments , and how it is transported from collapsing clouds to forming planetary systems . at the same time , new results are emerging on the water content of bodies in our own solar system and in the atmospheres of known exoplanets .",

    "the chemistry naturally responds to these changing conditions .",
    "a major question addressed here is to what extent the water molecules produced in interstellar clouds are preserved all the way to exoplanetary atmospheres , or whether water is produced in situ in planet - forming regions . understanding how , where and when water forms is critical for answering the question whether water - containing planets are common",
    "this section reviews the basic physical and chemical properties of water in its various forms , as relevant for interstellar and planetary system conditions .",
    "more details , examples and links to databases can be found in the recent review by @xcite .",
    "water can exist as a gas ( vapor or ` steam ' ) , as a solid ( ice ) , or as a liquid . at the low pressures of interstellar space ,",
    "only water vapor and ice occur , with the temperature at which the transition occurs depending on density . at typical cloud densities of @xmath7 particles",

    "such pressures and temperatures are typically achieved at the surfaces of bodies of the size of mars or larger and at distances between 0.7 and 1.7 au for a solar - type star .",
    "water ice can take many different crystalline and amorphous forms depending on temperature and pressure . at interstellar densities ,",
    "crystallization of an initially amorphous ice to the cubic configuration , @xmath9 , occurs around 90  k. this phase change is irreversible : even when the ice is cooled down again , the crystal structure remains and it therefore provides a record of the temperature history of the ice . below 90  k , interstellar ice is mostly in a compact high - density amorphous ( hda ) phase , which does not naturally occur on planetary surfaces @xcite .",
    "the densities of water ice in the hda , lda and @xmath9 phases are 1.17 , 0.94 and 0.92 gr @xmath3 , respectively , much lower than those of rocks ( 3.24.4 gr @xmath3 for magnesium - iron silicates ) .",
    "clathrate hydrates are crystalline water - based solids in which small non - polar molecules can be trapped inside ` cages ' of the hydrogen - bonded water molecules .",

    "they have been postulated to occur in large quantities on other planets and icy solar system bodies .      except for in - situ mass spectroscopy in planetary and cometary atmospheres , all information about interstellar and solar system water comes from spectroscopic data obtained with telescopes . because of the high abundance of water in the earth s atmosphere , the bulk of the data comes from space observatories . like any molecule",
    ", water has electronic , vibrational and rotational energy levels .",
    "dipole - allowed transitions between electronic states occur at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths , between vibrational states at near- to mid - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , and between rotational states from mid- to far - ir and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "interstellar water vapor observations target mostly the pure rotational transitions .",
    "h@xmath6o is an asymmetric rotor with a highly irregular set of energy levels , characterized by quantum numbers @xmath10 . because water is a light molecule , the spacing of its rotational energy levels is much larger than that of heavy rotors , such as co or cs , and the corresponding wavelengths much shorter ( 0.5 mm vs 37  mm for the lowest transitions ) .",
    "the nuclear spins of the two hydrogen atoms can be either parallel or anti - parallel , and this results in a grouping of the h@xmath6o energy levels into ortho ( @xmath11odd ) and para ( @xmath11even ) ladders , with a statistical weight ratio of 3:1 , respectively .",
    "radiative transitions between these two ladders are forbidden to high order , and only chemical reactions in which an h atom of water is exchanged with an h - atom of a reactant can transform ortho- to para - h@xmath6o and vice versa .    .",
    "the bands below 3 @xmath12 m are due to overtones and combination bands and are often targeted in exoplanet searches .",
    "this spectrum was observed with the nims instrument on the galileo spacecraft during its earth flyby in december 1990 . from @xcite , with permission from annual reviews , based on @xcite.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    infrared spectroscopy can reveal both water vapor and ice .",
    "water has three active vibrational modes : the fundamental @xmath13=10 bands of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 symmetric and asymmetric stretches centered at 2.7 @xmath12 m and 2.65 @xmath12 m , respectively , and the @xmath16 bending mode at 6.2 @xmath12 m .",
    "overtone ( @xmath17 or larger ) and combination ( e.g. , @xmath16+@xmath15 ) transitions occur in hot gas at shorter wavelengths ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : earthspectrum ] for example ) .",
    "gas - phase water therefore has a rich vibration - rotation spectrum with many individual lines depending on the temperature of the gas .",
    "in contrast , the vibrational bands of water ice have no rotational substructure and consist of very broad profiles , with the much stronger @xmath15 band overwhelming the weak @xmath14 band .",

    "spectra of hydrous silicates ( also known as phyllosilicates , layer - lattice silicates or ` clays ' ) show sharp features at 2.702.75 @xmath12 m due to isolated oh groups and a broader absorption from 2.753.2 @xmath12 m caused by interlayered ( ` bound ' ) water molecules . at longer wavelengths",
    ", various peaks can occur depending on the composition ; for example , the hydrous silicate montmorillonite has bands at 49 and 100 @xmath12 m @xcite .",
    "bound - bound electronic transitions of water occur at far - uv wavelengths around 1240  , but have not yet been detected in space .",
    "the strength of an emission or absorption line of water depends on the number of molecules in the telescope beam and , for gaseous water , on the populations of the individual energy levels .",
    "these populations , in turn , are determined by the balance between the collisional and radiative excitation and de - excitation of the levels .",
    "the radiative processes involve both spontaneous emission and stimulated absorption and emission by a radiation field produced by a nearby star , by warm dust , or by the molecules themselves .",
    "the main collisional partner in interstellar clouds is h@xmath6 .",
    "accurate state - to - state collisional rate coefficients , @xmath18 , of h@xmath6o with both ortho- and para - h@xmath6 over a wide range of temperatures have recently become available thanks to a dedicated chemical physics study @xcite .",
    "other collision partners such as h , he and electrons are generally less important . in cometary atmospheres ,",
    "water itself provides most of the collisional excitation .",
    "astronomers traditionally analyze molecular observations through a boltzmann diagram , in which the level populations are plotted versus the energy of the level involved .",
    "the slope of the diagram gives the inverse of the excitation temperature .",
    "if collisional processes dominate over radiative processes , the populations are in ` local thermodynamic equilibrium ' ( lte ) and the excitation temperature is equal to the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath19 .",
    "generally level populations are far from lte and molecules are excited by collisions and de - excited by spontaneous emission , leading to @xmath20 .",
    "the critical density roughly delineates the transition between these regimes : @xmath21 and therefore scales with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath12 the electric dipole moment and @xmath24 the frequency of the transition @xmath25 . in the case of water , the combination of a large dipole moment ( 1.86 debye ) and high frequencies results in high critical densities of @xmath26@xmath27 @xmath3 for pure rotational transitions .",
    "analysis of water lines is much more complex than for simple molecules , such as co , for a variety of reasons .",
    "first , because of the large dipole moment and high frequencies , the rotational transitions of water are usually highly optically thick , even for abundances as low as @xmath28 .",
    "second , the water transitions couple effectively with mid- and far - infrared radiation from warm dust , which can pump higher energy levels .",
    "third , the fact that the ` backbone ' levels with @xmath29=0 or 1 have lower radiative decay rates than higher @xmath29 levels can lead to population ` inversion ' , in which the population in the upper state divided by its statistical weight exceeds that for the lower state ( i.e. , @xmath30 becomes negative ) .",
    "infrared pumping can also initiate this inversion .",
    "the result is the well - known maser phenomenon , which is widely observed in several water transitions in star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bottom line is that accurate analysis of interstellar water spectra often requires additional independent constraints , for example from h@xmath31o or h@xmath32o isotopologues , whose abundances are reduced by factors of about 550 and 2500 , respectively , and whose lines are more optically thin . at infrared wavelengths ,",
    "lines are often spectrally unresolved , which further hinders the interpretation .",
    "o under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "three different chemical regimes can be distinguished : ( i ) ion - molecule chemistry , which dominates gas - phase chemistry at low @xmath33 ; ( ii ) high - temperature neutral - neutral chemistry ; and ( iii ) solid state chemistry .",

    "the abundance of volatile oxygen ( i.e. , not tied up in some refractory form ) is measured to be @xmath37 in diffuse clouds @xcite , so this is the maximum amount of oxygen that can cycle between water vapor and ice in dense clouds .",
    "counting up all the forms of detected oxygen in diffuse clouds , the sum is less than the overall elemental oxygen abudance .",
    "thus , a fraction of oxygen is postulated to be in some yet unknown refractory form , called udo ( ` unknown depleted oxygen ' ) , whose fraction may increase from 20% in diffuse clouds up to 50% in dense star - forming regions @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the abundances of elemental carbon and nitrogen are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , with about 2/3 of the carbon thought to be locked up in solid carbonaceous material .    for a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium ( te ) , the fractional abundance of water",

    "for the volatile elemental abundances quoted above , this results in an h@xmath6o fractional abundance of @xmath42 with respect to total hydrogen , if the co fractional abundance ranges from @xmath43 . with respect to h@xmath6 , the water abundance",
    "would then be @xmath44 assuming that the fraction of hydrogen in atomic form is negligible ( the density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath45(h ) + 2@xmath46(h@xmath6 ) ) .",
    "equilibrium chemistry is established at densities above roughly @xmath4 @xmath3 , when three body processes become significant .",
    "such conditions are found in planetary atmospheres and in the shielded midplanes of the inner few au of protoplanetary disks .    under most conditions in interstellar space",
    ", however , the densities are too low for equilibrium chemistry to be established . also , strong uv irradiation drives the chemistry out of equilibrium , even in high - density environments , such as the upper atmospheres of planets and disks . under these conditions ,",

    "the ionization rate of h@xmath6 is @xmath54 .    a series of rapid reactions of oh@xmath48 and h@xmath6o@xmath48 with h@xmath6 lead to h@xmath55o@xmath48 , which can dissociatively recombine to form h@xmath6o and oh with branching ratios of @xmath10.17 and 0.83 , respectively @xcite .",
    "h@xmath6o is destroyed by photodissociation and by reactions with c@xmath48 , h@xmath47 and other ions such as hco@xmath48 .",
    "photodissociation of h@xmath6o starts to be effective shortward of 1800   and continues down to the ionization threshold at 983   ( 12.61 ev ) , including ly @xmath56 at 1216  .",
    "its lifetime in the general interstellar radiation field , as given by @xcite , is only 40  yr .      at temperatures above 230  k , the energy barriers for reactions with h@xmath6 can be overcome and the reaction o + h@xmath6 @xmath57 oh + h becomes the dominant channel initiating water formation @xcite .",
    "oh subsequently reacts with h@xmath6 to form h@xmath6o , a reaction which is exothermic , but has an energy barrier of @xmath12100  k @xcite .",
    "this route drives all the available gas - phase oxygen into h@xmath6o , unless strong uv or a high atomic h abundance convert some water back to oh and o. high - temperature chemistry dominates the formation of water in shocks , in the inner envelopes around protostars , and in the warm surface layers of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the timescale for an atom or molecule to collide with a grain and stick to it is @xmath58 yr for normal size grains and sticking probabilities close to unity @xcite .",

    "reactions involving dust grains are therefore an integral part of the chemistry .",
    "even weakly bound species , such as atomic h , have a long enough residence time on the grains at temperatures of 1020 k to react ; h@xmath6 also participates in some surface reactions , but remains largely in the gas .",

    "other non - thermal ice desorption processes include cosmic ray induced spot heating ( which works for co , but is generally not efficient for strongly bound molecules like h@xmath6o ) and desorption due to the energy liberated by the reaction ( called ` reactive ' or ` chemical ' desorption ) .",

    "the details of this mechanism , which has not yet been included in models , are not yet understood and may strongly depend on the substrate .    once the dust temperature rises above @xmath1100  k ( precise value being pressure dependent ) , h@xmath6o ice thermally sublimates on timescales of years , leading to initial gas - phase abundances of h@xmath6o as high as the original ice abundances .",

    "deuterated water , hdo and d@xmath6o , is formed through the same processes as illustrated in figure  [ fig : network ] .",
    "there are , however , a number of chemical processes that can enhance the hdo / h@xmath6o and d@xmath6o / h@xmath6o ratios by orders of magnitude compared with the overall [ d]/[h ] ratio of @xmath64 in the local interstellar medium @xcite . a detailed description is given in the chapter by _ ceccarelli et al .",

    "@xcite pointed out that the fraction of deuterium relative to hydrogen atoms arriving on a grain surface , d / h , is much higher than the overall [ d]/[h ] ratio , which can be implanted into molecules in the ice .",
    "this naturally leads to enhanced formation of od , hdo and d@xmath6o ice according to the grain - surface formation routes . the high atomic d / h ratio in the gas arises from the enhanced gaseous h@xmath6d@xmath48 , hd@xmath49 , and d@xmath47 abundances at low temperatures ( @xmath6725 k ) , when the ortho - h@xmath6 abundance drops and their main destroyer , co , freezes out on the grains @xcite .",

    "od @xmath57 hdo + oh have been shown to occur rapidly in ices at higher temperatures ; these can both enhance and decrease the fractionation .",

    "a better approach is to take the actual stellar continua into account @xcite , with uv excess due to accretion added where appropriate @xcite . a very important factor in this regard is the relative strength of the ly@xmath56 line to the overall uv continuum .",
    "observations find that ly@xmath56 has nearly an order of magnitude more uv flux than the stellar fuv continuum in accreting sources @xcite .",
    "in addition because of the difference in scattering ( ly@xmath56 isotropic from h atom surface ; uv continuum anisotropic from dust grains ) , ly@xmath56 will dominate the radiation field deeper into the disk @xcite .",
    "most models find the presence of this warm water layer in dust - dominated disks .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that water can form in such high abundances in the surface layer that it mediates the transport of the energetic uv radiation by becoming self - shielding ( fig .  [",
    "fig : bergin ] ) .",
    "if this is the case , then the surface water would survive for longer timescales , because it is somewhat decoupled from the dust evolution . as a consequence water and chemistry in the midplane",
    "might be protected even as the fuv absorbing dust grains settle to the midplane .",
    "additional factors of importance for the survival of this emissive surface layer are the gas temperature and molecular hydrogen abundance .",
    "although theoretical solutions for the gas temperature are inherently uncertain , it is clear that hot ( @xmath123 few hundred k ) layers exist on disk surfaces @xcite .",
    "however , as the gas disk dissipates , the accretion rate onto the star decays on timescales of a few myr .",
    "thus the uv luminosity that is associated with this accretion declines and the disk will cool down , cutting off the production of water from the hot ( @xmath124 400  k ) gas - phase chemistry on the exposed surface .",
    "in addition , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the formation of surface water requires the presence of h@xmath6 to power the initiating reaction .",
    "finally , vertical mixing through turbulence or disk winds can bring water ice from the lower to the upper layers where the ice sublimates and adds to the oxygen budget and water emission @xcite .",
    "the dust particles in disks collide and grow , with water ice mantles generally thought to help the coagulation processes .",
    "the evolution of dust to pebbles , rocks and planetesimals ( 1100 km bodies , the precursors of comets and asteroids ) is described in the chapters by _ testi et al . _ and _ johansen et al._. the disk models cited above do not take into account transport of ice - rich planetesimals from the cold outer to the warm inner disk , even though such radial drift is known to be highly effective at a few au for rocks up to meter size ( or mm size further out in the disk ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this drift of icy planetesimals can be a source of water vapor enrichment inside the snow line @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical signature of this phenomenon would be the presence of water vapor in the inner disk with an abundance greater than the stellar oxygen abundance , because the planetesimals are hydrogen - poor , that is , the main volatile species , h@xmath6 , is not present in water - rich planetesimal ices . some of this hot water can diffuse outwards again and re - condense just outside the snowline ( the cold finger effect .",

    "another exciting discovery is the direct spectroscopic detection of water ice on the asteroid 24 themis @xcite , the largest ( 198 km diameter ) member of the themis dynamical family at @xmath13.2 au , which also includes three main belt comets .",
    "the 3.1 @xmath12 m spectral feature detected in themis is significantly different from those in other asteroids , meteorites and all plausible mineral samples available .",

    "they conclude that any ice that exists on these bodies should be relatively clean and confined to a @xmath010% fraction of the earth - facing surface .    altogether , these results suggest that water ice may be common below asteroidal surfaces and widespread in asteroidal interiors down to smaller heliocentric distances than previously expected",

    "observations during the deep impact encounter @xcite suggest a dust - to - gas ratio in excess of unity in comet 9p / tempel 1 .",
    "typically , cometary ice / rock ratios are of order unity with an implied porosity well over 50% @xcite .    the presence and amount of water in comets is usually quantified through their water production rates , which are traditionally inferred from radio observations of its photodissociation product , oh , at 18  cm @xcite .",

    "these multi - transition mapping observations show that the derived water production rates are sensitive to the details of the excitation model used , in particular the ill - constrained temperature profile within the coma , with uncertainties up to 50% @xcite .",
    "dynamically , comets can be separated into two general groups : short - period , jupiter - family comets and long - period comets ( but see @xcite for a more detailed classification ) .",
    "short - period comets are thought to originate from the kuiper belt , or the associated scattered disk , beyond the orbit of neptune , while long - period comets formed in the jupiter - neptune region and were subsequently ejected into the oort cloud by gravitational interactions with the giant planets . in reality , the picture is significantly more complex due to migration of the giant planets in the early solar system ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , recent simulations @xcite suggest that the sun may have captured comets from other stars in its birth cluster . in this case , a substantial fraction of the oort - cloud comets , perhaps in excess of 90% , may not even have formed in the sun s protoplanetary disk .",
    "consequently , there is increasing emphasis on classifying comets based on their chemical and isotopic composition rather than orbital dynamics @xcite .",
    "there is even evidence for heterogeneity within a single comet , illustrating that comets may be built up from cometesimals originating at different locations in the disk @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the ortho - to - para ratio in water and other cometary volatiles has been used to contrain the formation and thermal history of the ices .",
    "recent laboratory experiments suggest that this ratio is modified by the desorption processes , both thermal sublimation and photodesorption , and may therefore tell astronomers less about the water formation location than previously thought ( see discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "water is a significant or major component of almost all moons of the giant planets for which densities or spectral information are available .",
    "jupiter s galilean moons exhibit a strong gradient from the innermost ( io , essentially all rock , no ice detected ) to the outermost ( callisto , an equal mixture of rock and ice ) .",
    "ganymede has nearly the same composition and hence rock - to - ice ratio as callisto .",
    "assuming that the outermost of the moons reflects the coldest part of the circumplanetary disk out of which the moons formed , and hence full condensation of water , callisto s ( uncompressed ) density matches that of solar - composition material in which the dominant carbon - carrier was methane rather than carbon monoxide @xcite .",
    "the fact that callisto has close to ( but not quite ) the full complement of water expected based on the solar oxygen abundance implies that the disk around jupiter had a different chemical composition ( ch@xmath41-rich , co - poor ) from that of the solar nebula disk , which was co - dominated @xcite .",
    "the saturnian satellites are very different . for satellites large enough to be unaffected by porosity , but excluding massive titan",
    ", the ice - to - rock ratio is higher than for the galilean moons @xcite .",
    "however , titan  by far the most massive moon  has a bulk density and mass just in between , and closely resembling , ganymede s and callisto s .",
    "evidently the saturnian satellite system had a complex collisional history , in which the original ice - rock ratio of the system was not preserved except perhaps in titan .",
    "the moon enceladus , which exhibits volcanic and geyser activity , offers the unique opportunity to sample saturnian system water directly .",
    "neptune s triton , like pluto , has a bulk density and hence ice - rock ratio consistent with what is expected for a solar nebula disk in which co dominated over ch@xmath41 .",
    "its water fraction is about 1535% . at this large distance from the sun",
    ", n@xmath6 can also be frozen out and triton s spectrum is indeed dominated by n@xmath6 ice with traces of ch@xmath41 and co ices ; the water signatures are much weaker than on other satellites @xcite .",
    "the smaller trans neptunion objects ( tnos ) ( @xmath0few hundred km size ) are usually found to have mean densities around 1 g @xmath3 and thus a high ice fraction .",
    "larger tnos such as quaoar and haumea have much higher densities ( 2.63.3 g@xmath3 ) suggesting a much lower ice content , even compared with pluto ( 2.0 g@xmath3 ) @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the water ice content of the outer satellites varies with position and temperature , not only as a function of distance from the sun , but also from its parent planet .",
    "ice fractions are generally high ( @xmath9550% ) in the colder parts and consistent with solar abundances depending on the amount of oxygen locked up in co. however , collisions can have caused a strong reduction of the water ice content .",
    "the largest reservoirs of what was once water ice in the solar nebula disk are presumably locked up in the giant planets . if the formation of giant planets started with an initial solid core of 1015 earth masses with subsequent growth from a swarm of planetesimals of ice and rock with solar composition , the giant planets could have had several earth masses of oxygen , some or much of which may have been in water molecules in the original protoplanetary disk .",
    "the core also gravitationally attracts the surrounding gas in the disk consisting mostly of h and he with the other elements in solar composition .",
    "the resulting gas giant planet has a large mass and diameter , but a low overall density compared with rocky planets .",
    "the giant planet atmosphere is expected to have an excess in heavy elements , either due to the vaporization of the icy planetesimals when they entered the envelopes of the growing planet during the heating phase , or due to partial erosion of the original core , or both @xcite .",
    "these calculations assume that all heavy elements are equally trapped within the ices initially , which is a debatable assumption , and that the ices fully evaporate , with most of the refractory material sedimenting onto the core . in principle , the excesses provide insight into giant planet formation mechanisms and constraints on the composition of their building blocks .      for jupiter ,",
    "elemental abundances can be derived from spectroscopic observations and from data collected by the galileo probe , which descended into the jovian atmosphere .",
    "elements like c , n , s and the noble gases ar , kr and xe , have measured excesses as expected at 4@xmath1342 @xcite .",
    "however , o appears to show significant depletion .",
    "unfortunately , the deep oxygen abundance in jupiter is not known . the measured abundance of gaseous water ",
    "the primary carrier of oxygen in the jovian atmosphere since there is little co  provides only a lower limit since the troposphere at about 100 mbar is a region of minimum temperature ( @xmath1110 k for jupiter ) and therefore acts as a cold trap where water can freeze out .",
    "thus , the amount of gaseous water is strongly affected by condensation and rainout associated with large - scale advective motions @xcite , meteorological processes @xcite , or both .",
    "the galileo probe fell into a so - called ` hot spot ' ( for the excess brightness observed in such regions at 5 @xmath12 m wavelengths ) , with enhanced transparency and hence depleted in water , and is thus not representative of the planet as a whole .",
    "the water abundance , less than 1/10 the solar value in the upper atmosphere , was observed to be higher at higher pressures , toward the end of the descent @xcite .",
    "the sparseness of the measurements made it impossible to know whether the water had ` leveled out ' at a value corresponding to 1/3 solar or would have increased further had the probe returned data below the final 21 bar level .    as noted above , predictions for standard models of planetesimal accretion  where volatiles are either adsorbed on , or enclathrated in , water ice  give oxygen abundances 310 times solar in the jovian deep interior .",
    "although atmospheric explanations for the depleted water abundance in jupiter are attractive , one must not rule out the possibility that water truly is depleted in the jovian interior  that is , the oxygen - to - hydrogen ratio in jupiter is less enriched than the carbon value at 4@xmath1342 times solar .",
    "a motivation for making such a case is that at least one planet with a c / o@xmath1351a ` carbon - rich planet'has been discovered @xcite , companion to the star wasp12a with a c / o ratio of 0.44 , roughly solar .",
    "one explanation is that the portion of this system s protoplanetary disk was somehow depleted in water at the time the planet formed and acquired its heavy element inventory @xcite .    prior to this discovery ,",
    "the possibility of a carbon - rich jupiter was considered on the basis of the galileo results alone by @xcite who proposed that in the early solar system formation the snow line might have been further from the sun than the point at which jupiter formed , and volatiles adhering to solid organics rather than water ice were carried into jupiter .",
    "@xcite looked at the possibility that jupiter may have acquired planetesimals from an oxygen - depleted region by examining element - by - element the fit to the galileo probe data of two contrasting models : one in which the planetesimal building blocks of jupiter derived from a disk with c / o= 1/2 ( roughly , the solar value ) , and the other in which c / o=1 . within the curent error bars , the two cases can not be distinguished .",
    "however , any determination of the deep oxygen abundance in jupiter yielding an enrichment of less than 2 times solar would be a strong argument in favor of a water depletion , and thus high c / o ratio , at certain places and times in the solar nebula disk .",
    "are such depletions plausible ?",
    "a wide range of oxidation states existed in the solar nebula disk at different times and locations .",
    "for example , the driest rocks , the enstatite chondrites , are thought to have come from parent bodies formed inward of all the other parent bodies , and their mineralogy suggests reducing conditions  consistent with a depleted water vapor abundance  in the region of the nebula where they formed @xcite .",
    "one recent model of the early evolution of jupiter and saturn hypothesizes that these giant planets moved inward significantly during the late stages of their formation , reaching 1.5 au in the case of jupiter @xcite , almost certainly inward of the snow line ( see   [ sect : delivery ] ) . if planetesimals in this region accreted volatiles on refractory organic and silicate surfaces which were then incorporated into jupiter , the latter would appear carbon - rich and oxygen - depleted .",
    "however , temperatures in that region may not have been low enough to provide sufficient amounts of the more volatile phases .",
    "a second possibility is that jupiter s migration scattered these water poor planetesimals to the colder outer solar system , where they trapped noble gases and carbon - and nitrogen - bearing species at lower temperature  but water ice , already frozen out , was not available .    in order to test such models",
    ", one must directly determine the abundance of oxygen - bearing species in jupiter and if possible , in saturn .",
    "the case of saturn is similar to that of jupiter in the sense that the carbon excess as derived from ch@xmath41 spectroscopy is as expected , but again no reliable oxygen abundance can be determined .",
    "under the conditions present in the jovian envelope at least ( if not its core ) , water will dominate regardless of the initial carbon oxidation state in the solar nebula .",
    "nasa s _ juno _ mission to jupiter will measure the water abundance down to many tens of bars via a microwave radiometer ( mwr ) @xcite .",
    "complementary to the mwr is a near - infrared spectrometer jiram ( jovian infrared auroral mapper ) , that will obtain the water abundance in the meteorological layer @xcite .",
    "the two instruments together will be able to provide a definitive answer for whether the water abundance is below or above solar , and in the latter case , by how much , when _ juno _ arrives in 2016 .",
    "_ juno _ will also determine the mass of the heavy element core of jupiter , allowing for an interpretation of the significance of the envelope water abundance in terms of total oxygen inventory .",
    "there is no approved mission yet to send a probe into saturn akin to galileo .",
    "however , the _ cassini _",
    "saturn orbiter will make very close flybys of saturn starting in 2016 , similar to what _",
    "juno _ will do at jupiter .",
    "unfortunately , a microwave radiometer akin to that on _ juno _ is not present on _ cassini _ , but a determination of the heavy element core mass of saturn may be obtained from remote sensing . in summary , the fascinating possibility that jupiter and saturn may have distinct oxygen abundances because they sampled at different times and to differing extents regions of the solar nebula disk heterogeneous in oxygen ( i.e. , water ) abundance is testable if the bulk oxygen abundances can be measured .",
    "the carbon excesses measured from ch@xmath41 near - infrared spectroscopy give values of 3050 for uranus and neptune , compared with 9 and 4 for saturn and jupiter @xcite .",
    "these values are consistent with the assumption of an initial core of 1015 earth masses with heavy elements in solar abundances .",
    "unfortunately , nothing is known about the water or oxygen content in uranus and neptune , since water condensation occurs at such deep levels that even tropospheric water vapor can not be detected . unexpectedly , iso detected water vapor in the upper atmospheres of both ice giants , with mixing ratios orders of magnitude higher than the saturation level at the temperature inversion @xcite .",
    "these observations can only be accounted for by an external flux of water molecules , due to interplanetary dust , or sputtering from rings or satellites .",
    "similarly , _",
    "herschel _ maps of water of jupiter demonstrate that even 15 years after the shoemaker - levy 9 impact , more than 95% of the stratospheric jovian water comes from the impact @xcite . on the other hand , the low d / h ratios in molecular hydrogen measured by _",
    "herschel _ in the atmospheres of uranus and neptune may imply a lower ice mass fraction of their cores than previously thought ( 1432% ) @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that information on the deep oxygen abundance will be available for uranus and neptune anytime soon , since reaching below the upper layers to determine the bulk water abundance is very difficult .",
    "thus , data complementary to that for jupiter and saturn will likely come first from observations of neptune - like exoplanets .",
    "terrestrial planets were formed by accretion of rocky planetesimals , and they have atmospheres that are only a small fraction of their total masses .",
    "they are small and have high densities compared with giant planets . earth and venus have very similar sizes and masses , whereas mars has a mass of only 10% of that of earth and a somewhat lower density ( 3.9 vs 5.2 gr @xmath3 ) .",
    "terrestrial planets undergo different evolutionary processes compared with their gas - rich counterparts . in particular , their atmospheres result mostly from outgassing and from external bombardment .",
    "internal differentiation of the solid material after formation leads to a structure in which the heavier elements sink to the center , resulting in a molten core ( consisting of metals like iron and nickel ) , a mantle ( consisting of a viscous hot dense layer of magnesium rich silicates ) and a thin upper crust ( consisting of colder rocks ) .",
    "water has very different appearances on venus , earth and mars , which is directly related to their distances from the sun at 0.7 , 1.0 and 1.7 au , respectively .",
    "on venus , with surface temperatures around 730 k , only gaseous water is found , whereas the surface of mars has seasonal variations ranging from 150300 k resulting in water freezing and sublimation .",
    "its current mean surface pressure of 6 mbar is too low for liquid water to exist , but there is ample evidence for liquid water on mars in its early history .",
    "most of the water currently on mars is likely subsurface in the crust down to 2 km depth .",
    "earth is unique in that its mean surface temperature of 288 k and pressure of 1 bar allow all three forms of water to be present : vapor , liquid and ice . in ",
    "[ sect : origin ] , the origin of water on these three planets will be further discussed .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that even though these planets have very different atmospheres today , they may well have started out with comparable initial water mass fractions and similar atmospheric compositions dominated by h@xmath6o , co@xmath6 , and n@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "earth has a current water content that is non - negligible .",
    "the mass of the water contained in the earth s crust ( including the oceans and the atmosphere ) is @xmath136 earth masses , denoted as ` one earth ocean ' because almost all of this is in the surface waters of the earth .",
    "the mass of the water in the present - day mantle is uncertain .",
    "@xcite estimate it to be in the range of ( 0.88)@xmath137 earth masses , equivalent to 0.33 earth oceans .",
    "more recently , @xcite provides arguments in favor of a mantle water content as high as @xmath17 earth oceans .",
    "however , an even larger quantity of water may have resided in the primitive earth and been subsequently lost during differentiation and impacts .",
    "thus , the current earth has a water content of roughly 0.1% by mass , larger than that of enstatite chondrites , and it is possible that the primitive earth had a water content comparable with or larger than that of ordinary chondrites , definitely larger than the water content of meteorites and material that condensed at 1  au ( fig .  [",
    "fig : asteroids ] ) .",
    "remote sensing and space probes have detected water in the lower atmosphere of venus at a level of a few tens of parts per millions @xcite , confirming that it is a minor component .",
    "radar images show that the surface of venus is covered with volcanoes and is likely very young , only 1 billion years .",
    "direct sampling of the venusian crust is needed to determine the extent of past and present hydration which will provide an indication of whether venus once had an amount of water comparable to that on earth .",
    "hints that there may have been much more water on venus and mars come from d / h measurements ( see   [ sect : hdo ] ) .",
    "earth , mars and perhaps also venus all have water mass fractions that are higher than those found in meteorites in the inner solar nebula disk . where did this water come from , if the local planetesimals were dry",
    "? there are two lines of arguments that provide clues to its origin .",
    "one clue comes from measuring the d / h ratio of the various water mass reservoirs .",
    "the second argument looks at the water mass fractions of various types of asteroids and comets , combined with the mass delivery rates of these objects on the young planets at the time of their formation , based on models of the dynamics of these planetesimals .",
    "for example , comets have plenty of water , but the number of comets that enter the inner 2 au and collide with proto - earth or -mars is small .",
    "to get one earth ocean , @xmath138 impacting comets are needed .",
    "it is therefore not a priori obvious which of the reservoirs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asteroids ] dominates .",
    "related to this point is the question whether the planets formed ` wet ' or ` dry ' . in the wet scenario , the planets either accreted a water - rich atmosphere or they formed from planetesimals with water bonded to silicate grains at 1 au , with subsequent outgassing of water as the material is heated up during planet formation . in the dry scenario ,",
    "the terrestrial planets are initially built up from planetesimals with low water mass fractions and water is delivered to their surfaces by water - rich planetesimals , either late in the building phase , or even later after the planets have formed and differentiated . if after differentiation , this scenario is often called a ` late veneer ' . in the following ,",
    "we first discuss the d / h ratios and then come back to the mass fraction arguments .",

    "some measurements indicate that lunar water may have a factor of two higher hydrogen isotopic ratio than the earth s",
    "oceans @xcite , although this has been refuted @xcite .    mars and venus",
    "have interestingly high d / h ratios .",
    "the d / h ratio of water measured in the martian atmosphere is 5.5 times vsmow , which is interpreted to imply a significant loss of water over martian history and associated enhancement of deuterated water .",
    "because d is heavier than h , it escapes more slowly , therefore over time the atmosphere is enriched in deuterated species like hdo . a time - dependent model for the enrichment of deuterium on mars assuming a rough outgassing efficiency of 50% suggests that the amount of water that mars must have accreted is 0.040.4 oceans .",
    "the amount of outgassing may be tested by curiosity mars rover measurements of other isotopic ratios , such as @xmath153ar to @xmath154ar .",
    "the extremely high d / h ratio for water measured in the atmosphere of venus , about 100 times vsmow , is almost certainly a result of early loss of substantial amounts of crustal waters , regardless of whether the starting value was equal to vsmow or twice that value .",
    "the amount of water lost is very uncertain because the mechanism and rate of loss affects the deuterium fractionation @xcite .",
    "solar wind stripping , hydrodynamic escape , and thermal ( jeans ) escape have very different efficiencies for the enrichment of deuterium per unit amount of water lost .",
    "values ranging from as little as 0.1% to one earth ocean have been proposed .",
    "the above summary indicates at least two reservoirs of water ice rich material in the present - day solar system with d / h ratios consistent with that in earth s oceans : the outer asteroid belt and the kuiper belt or scattered disk ( as traced by comets 103p and 45p ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : asteroids ] , these same reservoirs also have a high enough water mass fraction to deliver the overall water content of terrestrial planets .",
    "the key question is then whether the delivery of water from these reservoirs is consistent with the current understanding of the early solar system dynamics .    over the last decade",
    ", there has been increasing evidence that the giant planets did not form and stay at their current location in the solar system but migrated through the protosolar disk .",
    "the grand tack scenario @xcite invokes movement of jupiter just after it formed in the early , gas - rich stage of the disk ( few myr ) .",
    "the nice model describes the dynamics and migration of the giant planets in the much later , gas - poor phase of the disk , some 800900 myr after formation @xcite , see chapter by _ raymond et al_.        the grand tack model posits that if jupiter formed earlier than saturn just outside the snow line , both planets would have first migrated inward until they got locked in the 3:2 resonance , then they would have migrated outward together until the complete disappearance of the gas disk ( see cartoon in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] ) .",
    "as summarized by @xcite , the reversal of jupiter s migration at 1.5  au provides a natural explanation for the outer edge of the inner disk of ( dry ) embryos and planetesimals at 1 au , which is required to explain the low mass of mars .",
    "the asteroid belt at 24 au is first fully depleted and then repopulated by a small fraction of the planetesimals scattered by the giant planets during their formation .",
    "the outer part of this belt around 4 au would have been mainly populated by planetesimals originally beyond the orbits of the giant planets ( @xmath1355 au ) , which explains similarities between primitive asteroids ( c - type ) and comets .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that as the outer asteroid belt is repopulated , @xmath155 earth masses of c - type material enters the terrestrial planet region , which exceeds by a factor 622 the minimum mass required to bring the current amount of water to the earth . in this picture , kuiper belt objects would at best be only minor contributors to the earth s water budget .",
    "the nice model identifies jupiter and saturn crossing their 1:2 orbital resonance as the next key event in the dynamical evolution of the disk in the gas - poor phase . after the resonance crossing time at @xmath156 myr ,",
    "the orbits of the ice giants , uranus and neptune , became unstable .",
    "they then disrupted the outer disk and scattered objects throughout the solar system , including into the terrestrial planet region .",
    "however , @xcite estimate the amount of cometary material delivered to the earth to be only about 6% of the current ocean mass . a larger influx of material from the asteroid belt",
    "is expected , as resonances between the orbits of asteroids and giant planets can drive objects onto orbits with eccentricities and inclinations large enough to allow them to evolve into the inner solar system . by this time",
    ", the terrestrial planets should have formed already , so this material would be part of a ` late delivery ' .",
    "the grand tack model provides an attractive , although not unchallenged , explanation for the observed morphology of the inner solar system and the delivery of water to the earth . in the asteroidal scenario ,",
    "water is accreted during the formation phase of the terrestrial planets and not afterwards through bombardment as a late veneer .",
    "typically , 50% of the water is accreted after the earth has reached 6070% of its final mass @xcite .",
    "this appears in contradiction with the measurements of the distinct d / h ratio in lunar water mentioned above , approximately twice that in the earth s",
    "oceans @xcite . if valid",
    ", this would indicate that a significant delivery of cometary water to the earth - moon system occurred shortly after the moon - forming impact .",
    "the earth water would thus be a late addition , resulting from only one , or at most a few collisions with the earth that missed the moon @xcite . expanding the sample of objects with accurate d / h measurements is thus a high priority , long - term science goal for the new submillimeter facilities .    while the case for late delivery of water on earth is still open",
    ", @xcite showed that the abundance of water derived for early mars is consistent with the general picture of late delivery by comets and bodies from the early asteroid belt .",
    "unlike earth , however , the small size of mars dictates that it acquired its water primarily from very small bodies ",
    "asteroidal ( sizes up to 100 km)rather than lunar ( @xmath157 km ) or larger .",
    "the stochastic nature of the accretion process allows this to be one outcome out of many , but the jupiter grand tack scenario provides a specific mechanism for removing larger bodies from the region where mars formed , thereby resulting in its small size .",
    "there are two ways for earth to get its water locally around 1 au rather than through delivery from the outer solar system .",
    "the first option is that local planetesimals have retained some water at high temperatures through chemisorption onto silicate grains @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for such material today in meteorites nor in the past in interstellar and protoplanetary dust (   [ sect : diskobs ] ) .",
    "however , the solid grains were bathed in abundant water vapor during the entire lifetime of gas - rich disks .",
    "this mechanism should differentiate between earth and venus .",
    "computation and lab studies @xcite suggest that chemisorption may be just marginally able to supply the inventory needed to explain earth s crustal water , with some mantle water , but moving inward to 0.7 au the efficiency of chemisorption should be significantly lower . finding that venus was significantly dryer than the earth early in the solar system history would argue for the local wet source model , although such a model may also overpredict the amount of water acquired by mars .",
    "the second wet scenario is that earth accretes a water rich atmosphere directly from the gas in the inner disk .",
    "this would require earth to have had in the past a massive hydrogen atmosphere ( with a molar ratio h@xmath6/h@xmath6o larger than 1 ) that experienced a slow hydrodynamical escape @xcite .",
    "one problem with this scenario is that the timescales for terrestrial planet formation are much longer than the lifetime of the gas disk .",
    "also , the d / h ratio would be too low , unless photochemical processes at the disk surface enhance d / h in water and mix it down to the midplane @xcite or over long timescales via mass - dependent atmospheric escape @xcite .",
    "h@xmath6o is expected to be one of the dominant components in the atmospheres of giant exoplanets , so searches for signatures of water vapor started immediately when the field of transit spectroscopy with _",
    "spitzer _ opened up in 2007 . near - ir spectroscopy with hst and from the ground can be a powerful complement to these data because of the clean spectral features at 11.6 @xmath12 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : earthspectrum ] ) .",
    "early detections of water in hd 189733b , hd 209458 and xo1b were not uniformly accepted ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and chapter by _ madhusudhan et al . _ for summaries ) .",
    "part of the problem may stem from hazes or clouds that can affect the spectra shortward of 1.5 @xmath12 m and hide water which is visible at longer wavelengths . even for the strongest cases for detection , it is difficult to retrieve an accurate water abundance profile from these data , because of the low @xmath158 and low spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "the advent of a spatial scan mode has improved hst s ability to detect exoplanetary water with wfc3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "figure from @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      models of hydrogen - dominated atmospheres of giant exoplanets ( @xmath159  k ; warm neptune to hot jupiter ) solve for the molecular abundances ( i.e. , ratios of number densities , also called ` mixing ratios ' ) under the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "non - equilibrium chemistry is important if transport ( e.g. , vertical mixing ) is rapid enough that material moves out of a given temperature and pressure zone on a timescale short compared with that needed to reach equilibrium .",
    "the ch@xmath41/co ratio is most affected by such ` disequilibrium ' chemistry , especially in the upper atmospheres .",
    "since co locks up some of the oxygen , this can also affect the h@xmath6o abundance .",
    "the two main parameters determining the water abundance profiles are the temperature - pressure combination and the c / o ratio .",
    "giant planets often show a temperature inversion in their atmospheres , with temperature increasing with height into the stratosphere , which affects both the abundances and the spectral appearance .",
    "however , for the full range of pressures ( @xmath160@xmath103 bar ) and temperatures ( 7003000 k ) , water is present at abundances greater than @xmath62 with respect to h@xmath6 for a solar c / o abundance ratio of 0.54 , i.e. , most of the oxygen is locked up in h@xmath6o .",
    "in contrast , when the c / o ratio becomes close to unity or higher , the h@xmath6o abundance can drop by orders of magnitude especially at lower pressures and higher temperatures , since the very stable co molecule now locks up the bulk of the oxygen @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath41 and other hydrocarbons are enhanced as well .",
    "as noted previously , observational evidence ( not without controversy ) for at least one case of such a carbon - rich giant planet , wasp-12b , has been found @xcite .",
    "hot jupiters like wasp-12b are easier targets for measuring c / o ratios , because their elevated temperature profiles allow both water and carbon - bearing species to be measured without the interference from condensation processes that hamper measurements in jupiter and saturn in our own solar system , although cloud - forming species more refractory than water ice can reduce spectral contrast for some temperature ranges .",
    "figure [ fig : hotjupiter ] illustrates the changing spectral appearance with c / o ratio for a hot jupiter ( @xmath161 k ) ; for cooler planets ( @xmath162  k ) the changes are less obvious .    what can cause exoplanetary atmospheres to have very different c / o ratios from those found in the interstellar medium or even in their parent star ?",
    "if giant planets indeed form outside the snow line at low temperatures through accretion of planetesimals , then the composition of the ices is a key ingredient in setting the c / o ratio .",
    "the volatiles ( but not the rocky cores ) vaporize when they enter the envelope of the planet and are mixed in the atmosphere during the homogenization process .",
    "as the giant planet migrates through the disk , it encounters different conditions and thus different ice compositions as a function of radius @xcite .",
    "specifically a giant planet formed outside the co snow line at 2030 au around a solar mass star may have a higher c / o ratio than that formed inside the co ( but outside the h@xmath6o ) snow line .",
    "the exact composition of these planetesimals depends on the adopted model .",
    "the solar system community traditionally employs a model of the solar nebula disk , which starts hot and then cools off with time allowing various species to re - freeze . in this model ,",
    "the abundance ratios of the ices are set by their thermodynamic properties ( ` condensation sequence ' ) and the relative elemental abundances .",
    "for solar abundances , water is trapped in various clathrate hydrates like nh@xmath55-h@xmath6o and h@xmath6s-5.75 h@xmath6o between 5 and 20 au . in a carbon - rich case ,",
    "no water ice is formed and all the oxygen is co , co@xmath6 and ch@xmath55oh ice @xcite . the interstellar astrochemistry community , on the other hand , treats the entire disk with non - equilibrium chemistry , both with height and radius .",

    "well outside the snow line , at large distances from the parent star , the planets are built up largely from planetesimals that are half rock and half ice .",
    "if these planets move inward , the water can become liquid , resulting in ` ocean planets ' or ` waterworlds ' , in which the entire surface of the planet is covered with water @xcite .",
    "the oceans on such planets could be hundreds of kilometers deep and their atmospheres are likely thicker and warmer than on earth because of the greenhouse effect of water vapor . based on their relatively low bulk densities ( from the mass - radius relation ) ,",
    "the super - earths gj 1214b @xcite and kepler 22b @xcite are candidate ocean planets .",
    "further examination of terrestrial planet models shows that there could be two types of water worlds : those which are true water rich in their bulk composition and those which are mostly rocky but have a significant fraction of their surface covered with water ( earth is in the latter category ) @xcite .",

    "the total earth hydrogen loss is estimated to be 3  kgs@xmath52 .",

    "the vast majority of the water bonds present today were , therefore , formed by the chemistry that led to the bulk of water in interstellar clouds and protoplanetary disks .",
    "here we summarize the key points and list some outstanding questions .",
    "water stays mostly as ice during protostellar collapse and infall .",
    "only a small fraction of the gas in the inner envelope is in a hot core where the water vapor abundance is high due to ice sublimation .",
    "water vapor is found in three different reservoirs in protoplanetary disks : the inner gaseous reservoir , the outer icy belt and the hot surface layers .",
    "the latter two reservoirs have now been observed with _",
    "spitzer _ and _ herschel _ and quantified .",
    "models suggest that the water that ends up in the planet and comet forming zones of disks is partly pristine ice and partly processed ice , i.e. , ice that has at least once sublimated and recondensed when the material comes close to the young star .",
    "planetesimals inside the disk s snow line are expected to be dry , as found in our solar system .",
    "however , gaseous water can have very high abundances in the inner au in the gas - rich phase .",
    "some grains may have chemically bound water to silicates at higher temperatures , but there is no evidence of hydrated silicates in meteorites nor in interstellar grains .",
    "dynamics affects what type of planetesimals are available for planet formation in a certain location .",
    "the presence and migration of giant planets can cause scattering of water - rich planetesimals from the outer disk into the inner dry zone .",
    "several comets have now been found with d / h ratios in water consistent with that of earth s oceans .",
    "this helps to constrain models for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets , but does not yet give an unambiguous answer .",
    "both dry and wet formation scenarios for earth are still open , although most arguments favor accretion of water - rich planetesimals from the asteroid belt during the late stages of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "delivery of water through bombardment to planetary surfaces in a ` late veneer ' can contribute as well but may not have been dominant for earth , in contrast with mars .",
    "jupiter may be poor in oxygen and water .",
    "if confirmed by the juno mission to jupiter , this may indicate a changing c / o ratio with disk radius .",
    "evidence for this scenario comes from the detection of at least one carbon - rich exoplanet .",
    "there are a number of open questions that remain .",
    "a critical phase is the feeding of material from the collapsing core onto the disk , and the evolution of the young disk during the bulk of the phase of star formation . at present",
    "this phase has little observational constraints .",
    "in addition numerous models posit that viscous evolution and the relative movement of the dust to the gas can have impact on the overall water vapor evolution ; this needs an observational basis .",
    "astronomical observations have been confined to water vapor and ice emission from the disk surface but with the midplane hidden from view .",
    "what does this surface reservoir tells us about forming planets , both terrestrial and giant ?",
    "is there a way to detect the midplane , perhaps using hco@xmath166 ( which is destroyed by water ) as a probe of the snowline ?",
    "however , this needs a source of ionization in the densest parts of the disk which may or may not be present @xcite .",
    "the exploration of deuterium enrichments continues to hold promise both in the solar system , with need for more information on the d / h values for water in the outer asteroids and ( main belt ) comets .",
    "it is also clear that we know less about the bulk elemental abundance of the solar system s largest reservoir of planetary material ( i.e. , jupiter and saturn ) than one might have assumed .",
    "this must have implications for studies of extra - solar systems . in terms of the origin of the earth",
    "oceans matching the full range of geochemical constraints remains difficult .    despite the uncertainties",
    ", there is a better understanding of the water trail from the clouds to planets . in this light",
    ", it is fascinating to consider that most of the water molecules in earth s oceans and in our bodies may have been formed 4.6 billion years ago in the cloud out of which our solar system formed .",
