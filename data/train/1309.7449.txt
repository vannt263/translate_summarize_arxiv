    "in recent years optical lattices have become a major research topic within the realm of ultracold quantum gases as they offer the perspective to simulate condensed matter physics under well - controlled conditions @xcite .",
    "most prominently , the quantum phase transition between a superfluid ( sf ) and a mott - insulating ( mi ) phase of a spinless bose gas loaded in a periodic optical potential has been experimentally observed by increasing the lattice depth @xcite .",
    "all properties of this quantum phase transition are captured by the underlying bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite for which different analytical solution methods have been worked out @xcite and high - precision monte carlo studies have been performed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extensions of the bose - hubbard model have been investigated , which cover for instance , superlattices @xcite , bose - fermi mixtures @xcite , quantum simulations like entanglement of atoms or quantum teleportation @xcite and disorder @xcite .",
    "preparing experimentally a spin-1 bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of @xmath0na or @xmath1rb atoms in an optical trap the atomic spin degrees of freedom are not frozen due to the electric dipole force between atoms and the electric field of a laser beam @xcite .",
    "this experimental realization of an optically trapped bec opened a new window to study also various phenomena of spinor bose gases loaded in an optical lattice .",
    "for instance , they offer the possibility of studying strongly correlated states , for example the coherent collisional spin dynamics in an optical lattice was measured in ref .",
    "@xcite and the @xmath1rb scattering lengths for @xmath2 and @xmath3 were determined in ref .",
    "in particular , combining the spin degree of freedom with various types of interactions and with different lattice geometries offers the prospect to realize a plethora of superfluid phases with magnetic properties .",
    "a first tentative step in this direction was the loading of @xmath1rb in a frustrated triangular lattice @xcite . despite these initial promising investigations , spinor bose gases in optical lattice",
    "seem experimentally to be so challenging that no further detailed experiments have been performed .",
    "theoretical progress in the study of spinor bose gases in an optical lattice was made by refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case of the anti - ferromagnetic interaction of @xmath0na the location of the sf - mi transition and several properties for sf and mi phases for spin-1 bosons",
    "were determined without external magnetic field at zero temperature .",
    "in particular , they found that the superfluid transition occurs into a polar spin-0 state @xcite and the sf phase represents a polar state with zero spin expectation value . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of a non - vanishing external magnetic field upon the sf - mi transition was determined within a mean - field approximation in refs .",
    "in addition , it was also shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the superfluid transition occurs from mott insulating phase into either a polar spin-1 or spin-(-1 ) state but it was not investigated which other phases might emerge deep in the superfluid phase .",
    "in this letter we study the effect of the magnetic field on the emergence of superfluid phases of spin-1 bosons .",
    "we show that new superfluid phases can emerge due to the interplay of the anti - ferromagnetic interaction of spin-1 bosons and an external magnetic field in a three - dimensional cubic optical lattice at zero temperature . to this end , we extend the ginzburg - landau theory developed in refs .",
    "@xcite from the spin-0 to the spin-1 bose - hubbard model . in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    "the underlying hamiltonian can be decomposed according to @xmath4 , @xcite where the local part @xmath5 reads @xmath6 whereas the bilocal part is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the chemical potential and the external magnetic field , respectively . furthermore , _",
    "@xmath10 _ represents the hopping matrix element between adjacent sites _",
    "@xmath11 _ and _ @xmath12 _ with @xmath13 indicating the summation over all nearest neighbor sites and _",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 _ stands for the on - site spin - independent ( dependent ) interaction strength between bosons .",
    "additionally , @xmath16 @xmath17 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator at site @xmath11 with hyperfine spin @xmath18 which determines the total atom number operator at site @xmath11 via @xmath19 and the spin operator at site @xmath11 according to @xmath20 with the spin-1 matrices @xmath21 .",
    "since the operators @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 commute with each other , their eigenvalue problems are solved by the same eigenvectors : @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 must be an even number @xcite .",
    "thus , the eigenvalue problem of the local hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) is given by @xmath29 where the energy eigenvalues are defined as @xmath30   & -\\mu n_{i}-\\eta m_{i}.\\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to artificially break the underlying @xmath31 symmetry of the hamiltonian @xmath32 , we follow refs .",
    "@xcite and generalize the usual field - theoretic approach for describing classical phase transitions @xcite to the realm of quantum phase transitions .",

    "therefore , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) equations of motion for determining the equilibrium value of the order parameter : @xmath49 furthermore , we read off from eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 - 20 ] ) that evaluating the effective action at the equilibrium field @xmath50 recovers the physical grand - canonical free energy : @xmath51=\\mathcal{f}\\left[0,0\\right].\\label{eq:4 - 22 - 1 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to calculate both the free energy @xmath52 and the effective action @xmath53 , we proceed perturbatively as follows .",

    "the respective perturbative contributions for @xmath52 contain different orders of the hopping matrix element @xmath10 and the currents @xmath12 and @xmath48 .",
    "as we work out a ginzburg - landau theory , we restrict ourselves to the fourth order in the currents .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the leading non - trivial order in the hopping @xmath10 which is of first order . therefore , the free energy functional can be expressed in terms of imaginary time integrals over sums of products of thermal green functions . the thermal averages in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 - 27 ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath59-particle green functions of the unperturbed system @xmath60\\right\\rangle ^{(0)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to calculate the correlation functions in many - body theory , we usually use the wick theorem which allows to decompose the @xmath59-point correlation function ( [ eq:3 - 36 - 1 ] ) into sums of products of one - point correlation functions @xcite . however ,",
    "this theorem is not valid for the considered system here because the unperturbed bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) contains terms which are of fourth order in the creation and annihilation operators . therefore , we use the cumulant decomposition for green function which is based on the locality of @xmath61 @xcite . with this ,",
    "the unperturbed one- and two - point green functions are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 in order to calculate the respective cumulants from combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 - 36 - 1])([eq:3 - 61 ] ) , we use for each lattice site the property @xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 represent recursively defined matrix elements of creation and annihilation operators . having calculated the free energy @xmath52 in this way , we perform then the legendre transformation ( [ eq:4 - 20 ] ) to determine the effective action . in the special case of a stationary equilibrium , which is site - independent due to homogeneity , the order parameter is given in terms of matsubara frequencies @xmath70 : @xmath71 thus , the on - site effective potential becomes @xmath72 with the landau coefficients    @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath75 denotes the coordination number in a @xmath76-dimensional cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath77 and @xmath78 follow from the cumulants but they are not displayed here due to their complicated and lengthy expressions .",
    "extremizing the effective potential ( [ eq:18 ] ) according to ( [ eq:4 - 22 ] ) we find at first the location of the quantum phase transition @xmath79 which turns out to coincide with the mean - field result in ref .",
    "@xcite , see . moreover , inserting ( [ eq:18 ] ) into ( [ eq:4 - 22 ] ) yields also the different superfluid phases for ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions with and without magnetization at zero temperature .",
    "if there is more than one solution , we must take the one which minimizes the effective potential for some system parameter . at first",
    ", we observe that the condensate in the superfluid phase above the first mott lobe shows , indeed , a sharp increase @xcite . thus , the condensate density can not be valid deep in the superfluid phase .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to determine the range of validity of the ginzburg - landau theory . to this end",
    ", we use the fact that we can not have more particles in the condensate than we have in total .",
    "this leads to the condition that the sum over the condensate densities @xmath80 is equal to the average number of particles per lattice site @xmath81 i.e. @xmath82 which is graphically shown in .",
    "but we read off from that condition ( [ eq:5 - 273 - 1 - 1 ] ) breaks down at the end of the lower mott lobes .",
    "there we have to use an additional criterion to obtain a finite range of validity . to this end",
    "we complement condition ( [ eq:5 - 273 - 1 - 1 ] ) by the additional ad - hoc restriction that above mott lobe @xmath59 the condensate density can not be larger than @xmath83 , yielding the boundary @xmath84 which is depicted in as a dashed orange line .",
    "now we show at zero temperature that our ginzburg - landau theory distinguishes between various superfluid phases for a ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interaction with and without external magnetic field within the validity range of our theory . without external magnetization",
    "the superfluid phase is a polar ( ferromagnetic ) state for anti - ferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) interactions , which is characterized by @xmath85 @xmath86 , in accordance with previous mean - field results @xcite . in the presence of the magnetic field",
    "the phase diagram does not change for the ferromagnetic interaction as the minimization of the energy implies the maximum of spin value as it is in the case without @xmath9 except the degeneracy with respect to @xmath87 is lifted , so the ground state becomes @xmath88 for an anti - ferromagnetic interaction , however , the situation is more complicated with an external magnetic field due to two competing effects . whereas , the anti - ferromagnetic interaction energetically favors anti - parallel spins , the external magnetic field has the tendency to align the spins . in the following we show that this competition leads to the appearance of different superfluid phases with different magnetic properties .    in , we study the predictions of the ginzburg - landau theory on how the external magnetic field affects the superfluid phases in the case of an anti - ferromagnetic interaction , i.e. @xmath89 . in this context",
    "it is important to determine the degeneracy when two states have the same energy with equal particle number but different total spin . using the ground state energy ( [ eq:3 ] ) and the degeneracy condition @xmath90",
    ", we obtain the critical spin - dependent interaction strength @xmath91 at the external magnetic field @xmath9 @xcite . with this , we get the resulting phase diagrams below and above the critical spin - dependent interaction strength :    when @xmath92 is 0.02 , the superfluid phase becomes @xmath85 where the ground state @xmath93 is the state with maximum spin for all six lobes as shown in . above the first critical value @xmath94 both the spin @xmath95 and the magnetic @xmath87 quantum numbers change from @xmath96 to @xmath97 for even lobes as shown in .",
    "we remark that if the spin - dependent interaction increases , the effect of the external magnetic field decreases , so the mott lobes increase . the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 appear in the sf phase for the fifth and sixth lobes .",
    "we note that the phase @xmath100 appears twice in the sixth lobe . the right phase in the sixth lobe results from the change of @xmath95 and @xmath87 for the seventh lobe from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , which happens at the critical value @xmath103 .    beyond the critical value @xmath104 the values of @xmath95 and @xmath87 for the odd lobes change from @xmath105 to @xmath106 as shown in .",
    "similarly , the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 appear in the sf phase for the fourth and fifth lobe and the phase @xmath98 increases in the sixth lobe . after the critical value @xmath107 , the ground states for the even lobes change from @xmath97 to @xmath108 as shown in",
    "by the same way the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 are seen in the sf phase for the third and fourth lobe .    when @xmath109 increases beyond the critical value @xmath110 , the ground states for the odd lobes change from @xmath106 to @xmath111 as shown in .",
    "the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 appear in the sf phase for the even and odd lobes . after the critical value @xmath112 ,",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath87 change from @xmath108 to @xmath113 for the even lobes as shown in .",
    "furthermore , the effect of magnetic field becomes very weak because the value of @xmath9 is close to @xmath109 .",
    "additionally , spin pairs are produced to get the minimal energy and , thus , the ground state becomes @xmath113 for an even @xmath59 , and @xmath111 for an odd @xmath59 .",
    "we found the new phase @xmath114 above the even lobes .",
    "furthermore , inspecting the energies of the respective phases in the vicinity of their boundaries allows to determine the order of the quantum phase transition . with this",
    "we find that the quantum phase transition from the mott insulator to the superfluid phase is of second order for spin-1 bosons in a cubic optical lattice under the effect of the magnetic field at zero temperature .",
    "thus , our finding disagrees with kimura et al .",
    "@xcite where a first - order sf - mi phase transition was found at a part of the phase boundary by using the gutzwiller variational approach . finally , we observe that the transitions between the different superfluid phases can be of both first and second order above the same mott lobe .",
    "for instance , the transition from @xmath115 to @xmath116 or vice versa is of first order , whereas the transition from @xmath115 to @xmath117 or @xmath118 phases or vice versa is of second order .",
    "in conclusion , we have worked out a ginzburg - landau theory for spin-1 bosons in a cubic optical lattice within its range of validity and investigated analytically and numerically at zero temperature the different superfluid phases for an anti - ferromagnetic interaction in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "depending on the particle number , the spin - dependent interaction and the value of the magnetic field we find superfluid phases with a macroscopic occupation of the two spin states @xmath119 or even of all three spin states 0 , @xmath119 .",
    "this is different from the mean - field approximation which only predicted two superfluid phases with spins aligned or opposite to the field direction @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to study how these results would change in a frustrated triangular optical lattice @xcite or in a superlattice @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge discussions with antun balaz and mathias ohliger as well as financial support from both the egyptian government and the german research foundation ( dfg ) via the collaborative research center sfb / tr49 condensed matter systems with variable many - body interactions ."
