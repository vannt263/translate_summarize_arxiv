    "the importance of cold collisions with regard to the dynamics of dilute neutral atom clouds was realized soon after the advent of laser - cooled and trapped atomic samples @xcite .",
    "since then , numerous investigations , both experimental and theoretical , have been made into the collisional properties of many different homonuclear @xcite and ( later ) heteronuclear @xcite systems .",
    "collisional studies are in themselves interesting , leading to an in - depth understanding of the various scattering mechanisms present at such low kinetic energies and methods by which we can have some measure of control over elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "as opposed to collisions between thermal atoms , collisions between cold atoms are sensitive to the long - range part of the interatomic interaction potential .",
    "the de  broglie wavelength may become comparable to the characteristic range of the interatomic potential , and ( in the presence of a light field ) the possibility of exciting a quasi - molecular state , and the subsequent decay of that state during a collision , becomes important .",
    "these effects lead to phenomena such as scattering resonances , interaction retardation , optically assisted collisions , photoassociation , optical shielding and the formation of ground - state molecules .",
    "optically assisted collisions lead to large losses in magneto - optical traps ( mots ) and are clearly dependant upon experimental parameters such as the intensity and detuning of the light frequencies present .",
    "a full theoretical treatment of these collisions is often hampered by the complexity of the molecular hyperfine structure @xcite , thus mots are usually empirically optimized for their intended application , and comparisons with theory or other experiments are difficult .",
    "collisions in the absence of a resonant light field are , on the other hand , a theoretically more tractable problem and their associated loss rate coefficients are fundamental properties of a given system , allowing direct comparisons with theory and between experiments .",
    "homonuclear and heteronuclear collisions , `` in the dark '' , between isotopes of a single element are both mediated at long - range by the van - der - waals interaction ( @xmath8 ) and any differences are due , in the main , to differing atomic structures and quantum statistical symmetries .    due to the high internal energy ( 19.8ev ) of metastable ( @xmath0 ) helium atoms ( he * ) , the spherical symmetry of this atomic state , and the inverted ( hyper)fine structure of the atoms ; ionizing collisions ( penning ( pi ) and associative ( ai ) ) : @xmath9 dominate losses in trapped samples of laser - cooled he*. this has provided a unique setting for the study of cold ionizing collisions in which the highly efficient , direct detection of collisional loss products using charged - particle detectors is possible . in the past ,",
    "several experiments have made use of microchannel plate ( mcp ) detectors to measure ion production rates and investigate collisional losses in @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "having realized the ability to trap large numbers ( @xmath12 ) of both isotopes ( either individually or simultaneously ) @xcite , we have previously reported on the isotopic differences between binary homonuclear collisions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite in the absence of resonant light , resolving inconsistencies in prior experimental and theoretical results .    in this article",

    "are dominated by only a few partial waves , @xmath17 , and the ionization cross section may be written as a sum over the partial wave contributions : @xmath18 from a semi - classical viewpoint we may further treat the inelastic scattering as a two - stage process in which ( at low energies ) elastic scattering from the interaction potential @xmath19 occurs at relatively large internuclear distance ( @xmath20 ) , whilst ionization occurs only at small internuclear distance ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the processes of elastic scattering and ionization are uncoupled allows us to factorize the probability of ionization occurring in a collision , and write the ionization cross section for collisions with total electronic spin @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the wave vector of the relative motion of the two atoms , @xmath25 is the probability of the atoms reaching small internuclear distance ( i.e. , not elastically scattering ) and is the probability of ionization occurring at short internuclear distance . in the he * system the quantum number @xmath22 is well conserved during ionization and the application of wigner s spin conservation rule @xcite tells us that is very small @xcite , while mller _ et al . _",
