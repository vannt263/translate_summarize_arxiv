    "in fact , it is the same covering space of @xmath31 as in theorem  [ fg](4 ) .",
    "also observe that @xmath3 and @xmath588 are of the same homotopy type since @xmath3 is a fibre bundle over @xmath588 with contractible fibre @xmath580 .",
    "therefore we have , @xmath589$].@xmath132    in the following theorem we shall find the necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath1 and hence on the arrangement @xmath540 , under which @xmath3 is aspherical .",
    "[ aspher2 ] @xmath3 is aspherical if and only if @xmath540 is a union of precisely codimension @xmath56 subspaces .",
    "since @xmath3 is of the homotopy type of a finite regular covering space over @xmath31 , it follows that @xmath31 is aspherical if and only if @xmath3 is aspherical . from theorem  [ aspher1 ]",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath31 to be aspherical is that @xmath135 is flag - like .",
    "therefore , it suffices to show that @xmath135 is flag - like if and only if @xmath540 is a union of precisely codimension two subspaces .",
    "now , by definition  7.1 , the condition for @xmath135 to be flag - like is equivalent to the condition that in @xmath1 there are no primitive collections consisting of more than two edges . also by definition  7.2 , @xmath590 , where the union is over primitive collections @xmath538 in @xmath1 and where @xmath591 is a subspace in @xmath57 of codimension precisely equal to the number of edges in @xmath538 .",
    "thus , @xmath135 is flag - like if and only if @xmath592 where the union runs over the primitive collections @xmath593 consisting of two edges or equivalently , @xmath540 is a union of codimension two subspaces .",
    "hence the theorem.@xmath132    -.5pc(_@xmath4-arrangements _ ) .",
    "the barycentric subdivision of any simplicial complex is a flag complex .",
    "hence , given a smooth complete fan @xmath1 , we can obtain several smooth complete flag - like fans whose cones are the cones over the simplices of the repeated barycentric subdivisions of @xmath467 .",
    "we therefore get several examples of @xmath4 arrangements finding which seems to be of interest in the topology of arrangements ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) . however , note that even if we start with a flag - complex , an arbitrary subdivision need not result in a flag - complex .",
    "for example , let @xmath1 be the fan consisting of the faces of @xmath594 in @xmath595 .",
    "if we refine @xmath1 by adding the edge vector through @xmath596 , then the resulting fan @xmath522 is not flag - like since , @xmath597 pairwise span cones in @xmath522 but together do not span any cone .",
    "indeed , both lemma  [ fundsub ] and theorem  [ aspher2 ] follow directly from the fact that @xmath3 is a smooth non - complete toric variety associated to the fan @xmath598 for every cone @xmath599 in @xmath600 ( cf . lemma  [ gq ] ) and applying theorems  [ fg ] and [ aspher1 ] .",
    "however , since @xmath3 has been defined specifically as the complement of real coordinate subspace arrangement related to a smooth complete fan @xmath1 , we therefore describe both its fundamental group and criterion for asphericity using @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath3 is the toric variety associated to the fan @xmath522 , we can apply theorems  [ pres ] and [ ab ] respectively to give a presentation for @xmath601 and give conditions on @xmath522 for it to be abelian .",
    "in particular , it follows from theorems  [ aspher2 ] and [ ab ] that @xmath3 is @xmath4 with @xmath602 abelian , if and only if it is the complement of subspaces of codimension precisely @xmath56 which pairwise intersect at @xmath603 .",
    "moreover , it also follows from lemma  [ fo ] that @xmath604 $ ] is always torsion free .",
