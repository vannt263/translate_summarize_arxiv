    "_ varius , multiplex , multiformis_. the three latin adjectives famously employed to describe the complex personality of roman emperor hadrian @xcite provide a remarkably accurate characterization of the nuclear response to neutrino interactions , resulting from the combination of _ many _ and _ diverse _ mechanisms , giving rise to _ distinct _ observable effects that hamper the interpretation of the measured cross sections .    the interest in theoretical modeling of neutrino - nucleus scattering was suddenly revived in the early 2000s , when the treatment of nuclear effects was clearly recognized as a major source of systematic error for accelerator - based searches of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "few years later , the inadequacy of the relativistic fermi gas model ( rfmg ) , largely employed in monte carlo simulations , was clearly exposed by its conspicuous failure to explain the double - differential @xmath0-carbon cross section in the charged - current quasi elastic channel , measured by the miniboone collaboration @xcite .",
    "the studies carried out over the past decade have led to the development of a number of more advanced models of quasi elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering , taking into account both the effects of strong interaction dynamics and the variety of mechanisms contributing to the flux integrated cross section  @xcite , some of which have reached the degree of maturity required for a meaningful comparison between their predictions and the available data . in this context",
    ", an essential role has been played by the availability of a large body of electron - nucleus scattering cross sections , precisely measured using a variety of targets and spanning a broad kinematical range . while the description of the measured neutrino - nucleus cross sections involves non trivial additional problems , mainly arising from the flux average  @xcite , the ability to explain electron scattering data must in fact be regarded as an obvious prerequisite , to be met by any models of the nuclear response to weak interactions .",
    "considerable progress has been also achieved by the _ ab initio _ quantum monte carlo method , which allows to carry out very accurate calculations of the electromagnetic and weak responses of nuclei as heavy as carbon  @xcite .",
    "this approach provides a remarkably good account of inclusive electron - nucleus scattering data in the kinematical regime in which the non relativistic approximation is expected to be applicable  @xcite .    in many instances ,",
    "the predictions of theoretical models turn out to be in satisfactory agreement with experiments .",
    "however , a deeper scrutiny reveals a puzzling feature : models based on conceptually differentsometimes even contradictoryassumptions yield comparable results . in view of applications to the different kinematical regimes and nuclear targets relevant to future experiments , the sources of degeneracy between different theoretical approachesimplying that the agreement between theory and data may in fact be accidentalneed to be identified , so as to firmly assess their predictive power .",
