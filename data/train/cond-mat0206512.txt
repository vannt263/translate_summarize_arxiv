    "lattice models of polymer solutions are widely used because of their simplicity and computational convenience .",
    "@xcite when modeling a polymer solution , the polymer chain occupies consecutive sites on the lattice , each site corresponding to the size of one chain unit , while the remaining sites correspond to solvent .",
    "the use of lattice models for polymer solutions dates back to the work of meyer @xcite .",
    "flory @xcite and huggins @xcite showed how , using a mean - field approximation , the lattice model yielded a powerful tool to predict the solution properties of flexible @xcite and semi - flexible @xcite polymers .",
    "various refinements to the flory - huggins ( f - h ) model have been proposed by a number of authors ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "fh - style models can account for liquid - liquid ( l - l ) phase separations with an upper critical solution temperature ( ucst ) driven by the site - to - site mixing pair interactions in polymer solutions - however , they are ill suited to describe polymer crystallization , i.e. liquid - solid ( l - s ) phase transitions .",
    "this limitation is not due to any intrinsic drawback of polymer lattice models as such , but to specific choice for the polymer interactions in the original f - h theory .",
    "in fact , the factors that lead to polymer crystallization , i.e. interactions that favor compact packing and stiffness of the polymer chains , can be accounted for in a lattice model , by introducing anisotropic interactions between adjacent polymer bonds .",
    "@xcite clearly , in real polymer solutions , both crystallization and phase separation can occur on cooling .",
    "while lattice models for polymer solutions can account for both types of phase transitions , most theoretical and simulation studies have focused on one transition or the other , and less attention has been paid to their interplay . such interplay may change the pathway of a phase transition @xcite and hence determine the complex structure - property relationships of mixtures containing crystallizable polymers , which has been the subject of much experimental research dating back to richards .",
    "when the l - s phase - transition curve intersects the l - l coexistence curve , both curves are terminated at the resulting triple point . below the triple point ,",
    "the fluid phase may phase - separate into a dilute solution and a dense crystalline phase , as depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this combination of l - l demixing and crystallization is often referred to as `` monotectic '' behavior and has been observed in many experiments .",
    "@xcite the morphology of polymer crystallites appears to be sensitive to the result of thermodynamic competition on cooling.@xcite special attention has been focused on the monotectic triple point .",
    "the kinetic competition between l - l demixing and crystallization on cooling in the vicinity of this triple point is an important issue for sol - gel transition and membrane preparation .",
    "@xcite on cooling through the triple point , l - l phase separation is expected to occur before crystallization , though both phase transitions have the same equilibrium temperatures.@xcite as a consequence , the density modulation produced during the early stage of l - l demixing may be frozen by subsequent crystallization .",
    "@xcite such frozen - in density modulations can be a practical way to control the metastable morphology of polymer gels and membranes through thermally induced processes .",
    "therefore , the ability to predict phase diagrams of the type shown in fig . [ fig1 ] could be of considerable practical importance .    in this paper , we study the interplay of polymer crystallization and l - l demixing using both mean - field theories and monte carlo simulations of simple lattice models . in particular , we pay attention to the shift of the crystallization and l - l demixing curves in the phase diagrams due to this interplay .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : after an introductory description of the simulation techniques , we compare the simulation results with the relevant theoretical predictions for the l - l phase separation curve without prior disorder - order phase transition on cooling .",
    "next , we discuss the simulations and mean - field calculation of the l - s curves and its thermodynamic competition with l - l demixing .",
    "in our monte carlo simulations , we used a single - site - jumping micro - relaxation model with local sliding diffusion @xcite to model the time evolution of self- and mutually - avoiding polymers in a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions . in this model , monomer displacements",
    "are allowed along both the cubic axes and the ( body and face ) diagonals , so the coordination number of each site includes all the neighboring sites along the main axes and the diagonals , and is @xmath0 . the single - site jumping model with either kink generation or end - to - end sliding - diffusion",
    "was first proposed by larson et al.@xcite the kink - generation algorithm was subsequently developed into the bond - fluctuation model.@xcite a hybrid model combining kink generation and sliding diffusion into one mode of chain motion , was suggested by lu and yang.@xcite the present hybrid model considers sliding - diffusion moves that are terminated by smoothing out the nearest kink conformation along the chain,@xcite in accord with de gennes s picture of defect diffusion along the chain.@xcite it has been verified that this model correctly reproduces both static and dynamic scalings of short polymers in the melt.@xcite    in our simulations , we consider systems containing a number of @xmath1-unit polymer chains .",
    "the polymers reside in a cubic box with @xmath2 lattice sites .",
    "the polymer concentration was varied by changing the number of polymers in the simulation box .",
    "monte carlo sampling was performed using the metropolis method .",
    "three energetic parameters were used to model the intra- and inter - molecular interactions of the polymers .",
    "the first parameter @xmath3 measures the energy penalty associated with having two non - collinear consecutive bonds ( a `` kink '' ) along the chain ; it is a measure of the rigidity of chains .",
    "the second parameter @xmath4 measures the energy difference between a pair of parallel and non - parallel polymer bonds in adjacent , non - bonded positions",
    ". a positive value of @xmath4 favors the compact packing of parallel chain molecules in a crystal .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath5 describes the energy penalty for creating a monomer - solvent contact .",
    "the total change in potential energy associated with a monte carlo trial move is @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the net change in the number of kinks , @xmath8 is the change in the number of non - parallel adjacent bonds , and @xmath9 measures the change in the number of monomer - solvent contacts .",
    "@xmath10 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath11 is the temperature . as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , three dimensionless parameters control the acceptance probability of monte carlo trial moves : @xmath12 is the term that dominates the l - l demixing temperature but no effect at all on the freezing of the pure polymer system . in contrast , @xmath13 completely determines the freezing temperature of the pure polymer system , but it has only a slight effect on the demixing temperature .",
    "in fact , from eq . [ eq5 ] below , it follows that , the critical demixing temperature is approximately a factor of @xmath14 higher in the case @xmath15 and @xmath16 than in the case where the values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are interchanged . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath17 is used as a measure of the ( inverse ) temperature of the system .",
    "if @xmath3 is much larger than @xmath5 and @xmath4 , the polymer chains behave as almost rigid rods . in contrast , if @xmath18 , the polymers are fully flexible . in",
    "what follows , we chose @xmath19 as a value typical for semiflexible chains .",
    "the choice of the value of @xmath12 ( and thereby the l - l demixing region ) is discussed in the following sections . in our simulations , we lowered the temperature by increasing the value of @xmath17 from zero in steps of @xmath20 . at each step , the total number of trial moves was @xmath21 mc cycles , where one monte carlo cycle ( mc cycle ) is defined as one trial move per monomer .",
    "the first @xmath22 mc cycles at each temperature were discarded for equilibration , after which samples were taken once per mc cycle and averaged .",
    "this process corresponds to a slow cooling of the sample system .",
    "the most direct way to establish the equilibrium phase diagram of this model system would be to compute the free energy of all phases . here ,",
    "we follow a different route : we attempt to locate the equilibrium phase - transition temperatures during the dynamic cooling process .",
    "however , rapid cooling may lead to a significant supercooling mainly due to the presence of a free - energy barrier for homogeneous nucleation .",
    "this is particularly true in dilute solutions and small systems . in order to identify the correct equilibrium coexistence curves in a dynamic cooling scheme",
    ", supercooling should be eliminated as much as possible . to this end , we introduced one solid layer of terraced substrate formed by extended chains , as shown in fig .",
    "these terraces can induce heterogeneous nucleation with a very small free - energy barrier .",
    "on such a large , terraced substrate , layer - by - layer crystal growth can take place directly , thereby obviating the need for homogeneous nucleation . in order to increase the accuracy of the method near the onset of the phase transition , we monitored the properties of the system during successive blocks of @xmath21 mc cycles .",
    "if , during such a block , we found evidence for the onset of a phase transition , we kept the temperature constant for a number of subsequent blocks , until no further drift in the system properties was observed .    on cooling ,",
    "the degree of order in the sample system can be traced by the flory `` disorder '' parameter , defined as the mean fraction of non - collinear connections of two consecutive bonds along the chains . on the cubic lattice , where @xmath23 out of @xmath24 directions for the connection to the next bond are non- collinear ,",
    "the high - temperature limit of the disorder parameter is @xmath25 .",
    "the degree of demixing of the system can be monitored by tracing the value of a `` mixing '' parameter , defined as the mean fraction of the sites around a chain unit , that are occupied by solvent .",
    "our estimates of the onsets of phase transitions are based on the averaged results of five independent cooling processes characterized by the same energy parameters , but different seeds for the random - number generation .    2     + * a. * +   + * b. *     + * c. * +   + * d. *    2    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the presence of a terraced substrate significantly decreases the kinetic delay on cooling for polymer crystallization from a dilute solution .",
    "the onset of crystallization induced by the terraced substrate becomes insensitive to the number of steps on the substrate when this number is larger than @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "one might expect that more steps on the substrate would cause the substrate to adsorb more chains .",
    "the fact that the phase - transition temperature becomes insensitive to the number of steps ( here , and in what follows , we use @xmath1 steps ) , suggests that pretransitional adsorption has a negligible effect on the apparent phase - transition temperature .",
    "in contrast , if no `` template '' is present , the onset of crystallization from a dilute solution , depends strongly on the system size .",
    "this effect is probably due to the volume dependence of the homogeneous nucleation rate .",
    "it can be completely eliminated by the introduction of a terraced substrate , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d .    in the following sections",
    ", we first consider the case that @xmath13 is zero and hence no crystallization can take place , while @xmath12 is large enough to induce l - l demixing on cooling .",
    "next , we switch on @xmath13 .",
    "this allows us to study a phase diagram that exhibits both l - l demixing and freezing .",
    "if both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are zero , the model only takes excluded - volume interactions and the temperature dependence of chain flexibility into account . even in this case , the polymer solution may exhibit a disorder - order phase transition on cooling .",
    "@xcite this transition is not , strictly speaking , a freezing transition but rather an isotropic - nematic phase transition : it is induced by the increase in anisotropic excluded volume interactions between polymer chains , due to the increase in chain rigidity on cooling .",
    "@xcite this transition has recently been studied extensively by weber et al .",
    "@xcite      we focused our attention on the l - l demixing with values of @xmath12 beyond that critical value , and kept track of the `` mixing '' parameter on cooling .",
    "as the dense liquid phase wets the terraced substrate , the onset temperature of l - l demixing induced by such a substrate should be a good approximation to the equilibrium phase separation temperature .",
    "a tentative binodal curve can thus be obtained in simulations to compare with the predictions of mean - field theories .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the binodal curves for the sample systems with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the binodal curve can be estimated from the condition of equal chemical potential of the coexisting phases , using the eqn .",
    "[ eq2 ] , the f - h expression for the mixing free - energy .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is polymer volume fraction , @xmath31 is the chain length , and @xmath14 the lattice - coordination number . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the theoretical predictions show a small but constant deviation from the simulation results .",
    "yan et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that a second - order lattice - cluster theory may provide a better description of the critical point of the binodal curve obtained in computer simulations . to second order ,",
    "the mixing free - energy change per lattice site is @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in terms of @xmath30 , @xmath14 and @xmath31 are given in ref .",
    "6 . when we compare the predictions of the second - order lattice - cluster theory with our simulations , ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) we find that this theory does not lead to better agreement with the simulation data , except perhaps at high polymer concentrations .",
    "it should be noted that , for very long polymer chains , the lattice cluster theory may predict more than one critical point .",
    "@xcite hence , the predictions of this theory should be viewed with some caution .",
    "@xcite    [ [ polymer - crystallization - and - its - interplay - with - liquid - liquid - demixing ] ] polymer crystallization and its interplay with liquid - liquid demixing ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    when we set @xmath37 and @xmath19 , l - l demixing is preempted by freezing .",
    "in fact , an estimate based on mean - field theory ( eqn .",
    "[ eq4a ] below ) indicates that , for these parameter values , the freezing temperature of the pure polymer is a factor four higher than the critical demixing temperature .",
    "we assume that the onset of crystallization induced by the terraced substrate , yields a good approximation for the equilibrium melting temperature .",
    "it is this temperature that we subsequently compare with the corresponding prediction of mean - field theory .",
    "the mean - field expression for the partition function of the disordered polymer solution is given by  @xcite : @xmath38 where + @xmath39 , + @xmath40 $ ] , + @xmath41 + @xmath42 denotes the number of sites occupied by the solvent , @xmath43 the number of chains , each having @xmath31 units , and @xmath44 .",
    "we note that , in the above expression , we have corrected an error in the expression for the partition function given in ref .",
    "the corresponding expression for the free - energy density ( i.e. the helmholtz free energy per lattice site ) is @xmath45    we assume that the pure polymer crystal is in its fully ordered ground state and that the partition function of this state is equal to one . in a pure polymer system , melting takes place at the point where the free energies of the crystal and the melt cross . for polymer solutions ,",
    "the freezing curve can be computed by imposing that the chemical potential of the polymers in crystal and solution are equal , i. e. @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the chemical potential of polymers in the ground state . as the free energy of the crystal phase",
    "is assumed to be equal to zero , the chemical potential of the polymers in that phase is also equal to zero.the chemical potential of the polymers in solution is @xmath48 .",
    "thus by solving the equation @xmath49 by iteration , we can obtain the equilibrium melting temperature .    starting the calculation from eq .",
    "[ eq4a ] , the f - h expression for the mixing free - energy change becomes @xmath50 the binodal l - l curves can be separately estimated without the consideration of l - s curves .    in figs .",
    "[ fig4]a and [ fig4]b , we compare the mean - field predictions for the phase diagram with the simulation data . in view of the simplicity of the mean - field theory , the agreement between theory ( without adjustable parameters ) and the simulation data , is gratifying .    according to eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] , we should expect that a positive value of @xmath13 will increase the l - l demixing temperature .",
    "this is precisely the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the l - l demixing curve of the sample system with @xmath28 shifts up when the value of @xmath13 changes from zero to one . by carefully choosing the parameters , such as @xmath51",
    ", we can `` tune '' the relative strength of the tendencies to crystallize and to demix , and observe the intersection of the l - s and l - l curves .",
    "although a change in the value of @xmath12 can not change the freezing temperature of pure polymers , it can change the l - s coexistence curve of polymer solutions .",
    "the reason is that a poor solvent favors phase separation ( be it l - l or l - s ) .",
    "however , in the simulations , we observed that the l - s curves cross not only at @xmath52 but also at a second point near @xmath53 .",
    "this crossing point is not related to the presence of the terraced substrate , as it has also been observed in the absence of such a template.@xcite possibly , this failure of the simple mean - field theory is due to the rather naive way in which it accounts for the effective coordination of monomers .",
    "we point out that , in our estimate , we have assumed that the effective coordination number is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "but , in more sophisticated theoretical descriptions , @xmath55 ( as in eq .  [ eq3 ] ) is , itself , concentration dependent .",
    "flory has proposed a semi - empirical relationship between the melting point and the concentration of polymers in solutions , @xcite as given by @xmath56 , \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the equilibrium melting point of bulk polymers , @xmath58 is the heat of fusion per chain - unit .",
    "the predictions of eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] for the melting - point depression upon dilution have been verified by several experimental measurements at both high and low concentration ends .",
    "@xcite the linear relationship predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] does hold for those simulations where l - l demixing does not occur ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . according to eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] , the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be obtained respectively from the slope and the intercept of the freezing `` line '' .",
    "we found that @xmath59 depends nearly linearly on @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , @xmath62 varies linearly with @xmath12 . assuming that both relations are , in fact , linear , we find : @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the latter result implies a microscopic coupling between l - l demixing and polymer crystallization , consistent but not identical with the previous study .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we have addressed the equilibrium freezing and demixing curves of lattice polymers . in subsequent work",
