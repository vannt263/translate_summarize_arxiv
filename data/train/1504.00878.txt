    "the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , as one of the universal equations that describe the evolution of slowly varying packets of quasi - monochromatic waves in weakly nonlinear dispersive media , has been very successful in many applications such as nonlinear optics and water waves @xcite .",
    "the nls equation is integrable and can be solved by the inverse scattering transform @xcite . however , in the regime of ultra - short pulses where the width of optical pulse is in the order of femtosecond ( @xmath1 s ) , the nls equation becomes less accurate @xcite .",
    "description of ultra - short processes requires a modification of going beyond the standard slow varying envelope approximation ( svea ) .",
    "recently , schfer and wayne derived a short pulse ( sp ) equation @xmath2 in attempting to describe the propagation of ultra - short optical pulses in nonlinear media @xcite . here , @xmath3 is a real - valued function , representing the magnitude of the electric field , the subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote partial differentiation .",
    "it has been shown that the sp equation performs better than nls under this case @xcite .",
    "apart from the context of nonlinear optics , the sp equation has also been derived as an integrable differential equation associated with pseudospherical surfaces @xcite .",
    "the sp equation has been shown to be completely integrable @xcite .",
    "the loop soliton solutions as well as smooth soliton solutions of the sp equation were found in @xcite .",
    "the connection between the sp equation and the sine - gordon equation through the hodograph transformation was clarified , and then the @xmath0-soliton solutions including multi - loop and multi - breather ones were given in matsuno_spe , matsuno_spereview by using hirota s bilniear method @xcite .",
    "an integrable discretization of the sp equation was constructed by the authors in @xcite , and its geometric interpretation was given in @xcite .",
    "a major simplification made in the derivation of the short pulse equation is to assume that the polarization is preserved during its propagating inside an optical fiber .",
    "however , this is not always the case in practice .",
    "for example , we have to take into account the effects of polarization or anisotropy in birefringent fibers @xcite .",
    "therefore , an extension to a two - component version of the short pulse equation is needed in order to describe the propagation of ultra - short pulse in birefringent fibers .",
    "in fact , several integrable coupled short pulse have been proposed in the literature pkb_cspe , hoissen_cspe , matsuno_cspe , feng_cspe , zengyao_cspe , comspe .",
    "the bi - hamiltonian structures for several coupled short pulse equations were obtained in @xcite .    in the present paper , we are concerned with the integrable semi - discretization of a multi - component short pulse ( mcsp ) equation @xmath6 where the coefficients @xmath7 are arbitrary constants with symmetry @xmath8 .",
