    "one of the challenges of modern physics is the description of the internal structure of the hadrons .",
    "it is believed that the substructure of the the hadrons in general and the nucleon and the nucleon resonances in particular , are ruled by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "although qcd can be useful for reactions at high @xmath7 , it becomes more complex at low and intermediate @xmath7 , which restrains the theoretical predictions for that range  @xcite .",
    "therefore in practice to obtain predictions for small @xmath7 one has sometimes to rely on effective degrees of freedom as the constituent quarks .",
    "the quark substructure of a baryon can in first approximation be classified in terms of the @xmath16 spin - flavor symmetry , combined with the @xmath17 group for radial and rotational excitations . in that framework",
    "the spin 1/2 baryons , including the nucleon , and the spin 3/2 baryons can be classified in supermultiplets @xmath18 $ ] characterized by angular momentum ( @xmath19 ) , quark total spin ( @xmath20 ) , orbital angular momentum ( @xmath21 ) and parity ( @xmath22 ) . in the notation",
    "@xmath18 $ ] , @xmath16 represents the number of particles of the multiplet ( including all spin projections ) .",
    "then the nucleon ( @xmath23 ) is part of the @xmath24 $ ] supermultiplet and the states @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , also represented by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , also represented by @xmath30 are part of the @xmath2 $ ] supermultiplet @xcite .    the use of the @xmath31 group @xcite to represent the wave functions of a baryon ( three - quark system ) combined with the electromagnetic interaction in impulse approximation leads to the so - called single quark transition model ( sqtm ) @xcite . here",
    ", single means that only one quark couples with the photon ( impulse approximation ) . in these conditions",
    "the sqtm can be used to parametrize the transition current between two supermultiplets , in an operational form that includes only four independent terms , with coefficients exclusively dependent of @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the sqtm can be used to parametrize the @xmath0 transitions , where @xmath1 is a nucleon ( isospin 1/2 ) or a @xmath32 ( isospin 3/2 ) excitation from the @xmath2 $ ] supermultiplet , in terms of three independent functions of @xmath7 : @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the relation between the functions @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and the amplitudes are presented in table  [ tableamp ] . in the table , besides the transitions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one has expressions for the transitions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "once the coefficients @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are determined it is possible to predict the transition helicity amplitudes for all the resonances from the @xmath2 $ ] supermultiplet .",
    "the relations presented in the table are based in the exact @xmath16 spin - flavor symmetry broken by the color - hyperfine interaction between quarks .",
    "that interaction leads to the configuration mixing between various baryon states characterized by some mixing angles , estimated from hadron decays  @xcite .",
    "note however , that as the sqtm is based exclusively on the valence quark degrees of freedom , we should not expect a good description of the reactions at low @xmath7 , where meson cloud effects may be very important  @xcite .",
    "calculations for the same helicity amplitudes using quark models can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the covariant spectator quark model was applied in the past to the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon @xcite and the @xmath27 , @xmath30 excitations  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the transition helicity amplitudes are based mainly on the valence quark content , but some information about additional effects like the meson cloud dressing can be inferred from the formalism .",
    "one can then use the results from the covariant spectator quark model for the @xmath39 amplitude in the @xmath27 transition and the two transverse amplitudes ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) in the @xmath30 transition , to calculate @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "note , however , that because the valence quark effects are dominant only at large @xmath7 , the results are accurate only in that region .",
    "based on the results of the covariant spectator quark model for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 transitions we estimate that the predictions of the model should be accurate for the @xmath14 gev@xmath15 region .    as the covariant spectator quark model breaks the @xmath41-isospin symmetry , the use of that model to calculate the functions @xmath5 , and @xmath6 from the sqtm has to be understood as an approximation , with a degree of error proportional to the percentage of the @xmath41 breaking . as consequence",
    "the estimation for neutral reactions ( with neutron targets ) will be less reliable , since in the covariant spectator quark model those reactions depend significantly of the @xmath41 breaking .",
    "for instance , the neutron electric form factor would vanish if the @xmath41 symmetry breaking was not considered @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section we present the relations between the @xmath0 amplitudes for the @xmath1 resonances of the @xmath2 $ ] supermultiplet and the functions @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , according to the sqtm . in sec .",

    "we recall that the proposed parametrization for the meson cloud contribution has a very slow falloff ( large cutoff @xmath79 ) , which is more typical of a valence quark contribution than from a meson cloud effect contribution .",
