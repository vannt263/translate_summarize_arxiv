    "as part of efforts to determine the nature of faint infrared sources , hundreds of spectra have been obtained with the infrared spectrograph on @xmath2 ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) of optically faint sources discovered at 24 @xmath5 m with surveys using the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "the most important result is that these faint sources having @xmath4(24 @xmath5 m ) @xmath3 1 mjy are generally at high redshift , typically z @xmath3 2 @xcite .",
    "most show the 9.7@xmath5 m  silicate absorption feature , but some have pah emission features and some have only a continuum with no detectable features .",
    "these results imply that the sources are optically faint because they are both distant and obscured by dust .    the absorbed sources and the featureless",
    ", power - law sources have been interpreted as obscured agn @xcite .",
    "this interpretation implies that the surface density of optically obscured agn at high redshifts exceeds that for classical , optically discoverable agn by a factor of two to three in infrared surveys to @xmath4(24 @xmath5 m ) @xmath10 1 mjy @xcite .",
    "extremely luminous starbursts have also been found at z @xmath3 2 @xcite which appear similar to local starbursts in all characteristics except luminosity .    to understand these high redshift , dusty sources and to interpret the @xmath2-discovered sources within scenarios for evolution in the universe",
    ", it is essential to understand how the sources of luminosity are distributed between agn and starbursts among the overall population of sources .",
    "this requires comparison with closer , brighter examples for which agn and starburst diagnostics within the irs spectra can be compared to information from other wavelengths .",
    "so far , the comparison samples which show the most similar spectral shapes are the ulirgs @xcite , but the ulirgs have lower luminosities and smaller redshifts than the sources at z @xmath3 2 .",
    "the ulirgs observed with the irs were chosen primarily on the basis of 60 @xmath5 m fluxes from the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and were not selected based on optical characteristics .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a sample of optically faint , infrared - bright galaxies which spans luminosities and redshifts between the ulirg and high redshift @xmath2 irs samples .",
    "this new sample arises from selecting the optically faintest sources listed in the iras faint source catalog ( fsc)@xcite .",
    "these sources have @xmath0 @xmath1 18 mag ( the photographic @xmath0 magnitude band is centered at 0.66 @xmath5 m and approximately corresponds to @xmath11 magnitude @xcite ) .    as an additional selection criterion",
    ", we also require that the source be present in the first radio survey @xcite .",
    "the requirement of a radio detection was used to increase confidence that an fsc source is real ( as opposed to noise or cirrus ) and to provide an accurate position for selection of the optical counterpart .",
    "new irs spectra of 24 sources and 4 spectra of archival sources are presented .",
    "this sample of 28 sources is compared to previous samples of bright iras sources for which @xmath2 irs spectroscopy is available , and the validity of the fsc identifications is discussed .",
    "spectral parameters are used to estimate starburst and agn contributions to the luminosity .",
    "to select a sample of optically faint infrared sources from the iras fsc , we first cross - correlated the iras fsc sources with the first catalog , using fsc sources listed as real detections rather than upper limits at both 25 @xmath5 m and 60 @xmath5 m ( sources with quality flags 2 or 3 ) .",
    "2,310 sources were associated to within 3 times the fsc one sigma positional uncertainty ( ranging from 15to 90for individual sources ) .",
    "images from the palomar second digitized sky survey ( dss2 ) were then examined for the 2,310 fields to determine an optical identification at the radio source position .    of the 2,310 sources ,",
    "1,944 can be identified with bright or medium brightness galaxies ( photographic @xmath0 @xmath10 16 mag ) , and 225 are fainter galaxies ( 16 mag @xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath10 21 mag ) .",
    "the remaining 141 sources are identified with bright galactic stars or have no optically identifiable galaxy ; the latter could be either spurious sources or cirrus sources .",
    "the best available optical photometry for the entire fsc sample is the minnesota aps catalog @xcite , which gives photographic @xmath12 and @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "the final sample we select is defined by having @xmath0 @xmath13 18 .",
    "while actual magnitudes are uncertain to a few - tenths , we can have confidence that the aps magnitudes are homogeneous and allow location of the optically faintest sources .",
    "the selection for @xmath0 @xmath13 18 yields 31 sources , which is about 1% of all sources common between fsc and first .",
    "we have obtained irs low - resolution spectra for 24 of these 31 sources , and an additional 4 have been observed in other @xmath2 programs .",
    "the sample of objects and the details of the @xmath2 irs observations are in table 1 .",
    "our new observations were made with the irs short low module in orders 1 and 2 ( sl1 and sl2 ) and with the long low module in orders 1 and 2 ( ll1 and ll2 ) , described in @xcite .",
    "these give low resolution spectral coverage from @xmath35@xmath5 m  to @xmath335@xmath5 m  .",
    "sources were placed on the slit by using the irs peakup mode with the red camera .",
    "background subtraction for spectra was done using coadded background images that added both nod positions having the source in the other slit ( i.e. , both nods on the ll1 slit when the source is in the ll2 slit produce ll1 spectra of background only ) .",
    "this subtraction is possible when both sl orders or both ll orders are observed with the same integration times .",
    "independent extractions of spectra at the two nod positions were compared to reject any highly outlying pixels in either spectrum , and a final mean spectrum was produced .    starting with v15 of the ssc basic calibrated data ( bcd ) ,",
    "spectra were extracted using the smart analysis package @xcite .",
    "extractions were done with an average width of 4 pixels ( perpendicular to dispersion ; width varies with wavelength because of varying spatial resolution ) .",
    "calibrations applied to bcd products use extractions of 8 pixel width for the calibrating stars , so we correct fluxes by using markarian 231 as a standard source and extracting it with both 8 pixel and 4 pixel windows .",
    "final spectra were boxcar - smoothed to the approximate resolution of the different irs modules ( 0.2@xmath5 m  for sl1 and sl2 , 0.3@xmath5 m  for ll2 , and 0.4@xmath5 m  for ll1 ) .",
    "all spectra are illustrated in figures 1 - 4 , ordered by luminosity .",
    "measured continuum parameters and feature strengths for the spectra are in table 2 .",
    "fluxes and equivalent widths ( ews ) for the 6.2@xmath5 m  and 11.3@xmath5 m  pah features are measured using the single gaussian line fit routine within smart . for the 6.2@xmath5 m",
    "pah line , the fitting is between 5.5@xmath5 m  and 6.9 @xmath5 m  ; for the 11.3@xmath5 m  line , fitting is between 10.4@xmath5 m  and 12.2@xmath5 m  .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , fluxes and ews of pah features depend on the underlying continuum level which is selected .",
    "this is not a straightforward choice and is more uncertain for the blended 7.7@xmath5 m  feature than for the individual 6.2@xmath5 m  and 11.3@xmath5 m  features . to minimize uncertainties based on assumptions for fitting the features",
    ", we do not list measurements for the 7.7@xmath5 m  line .",
    "the fitting procedure we use applies a linear fit for the continuum and a gaussian fit for the line between the selected wavelengths .",
    "this linear continuum fit is somewhat different from the spline fit used by @xcite and yields a higher continuum level . to estimate uncertainties arising from the fitting procedure",
    ", we remeasured the brandl starbursts with the procedure we use . using the 17 starbursts having single components",
    "( so there is no uncertainty regarding what flux to include in the spectral extraction ) , the average ew of the 6.2@xmath5 m  feature given by @xcite is greater by 1.11 then the ews we measure .    in table 2",
    ", the parameter @xmath14 describing the depth of the 9.7@xmath5 m  silicate absorption feature is measured using the continuum fitting technique described by @xcite .",
    "the average spectrum of the 19 sources showing silicate absorption is compared to the spectrum of markarian 231 in figure 5 .",
    "we note that source 9 is a blazar @xcite with observed irs flux at 25@xmath5 m  smaller by a factor of 30 than when observed by iras .",
    "the source met the criteria for definition of the sample and so was observed , but this source is not included in the luminosity plots . as a result of the unexpectedly low flux , the irs spectrum is very noisy and shows no measurable features ( figure 4 ) .",
    "pah limits are not meaningful for this source compared to those for other sources .",
    "the optically faint sources chosen are often near the lower limit of @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) in the iras fsc ; the mean fsc @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) of the sources chosen is 150 mjy , but the typical one sigma noise for an fsc source is 65 mjy . at this low signal to noise , some of these sources may be spurious .",
    "they could appear in the fsc catalog either because of enhancing noise or because of confusing galactic cirrus .    to test the reality of the fsc sources",
    ", we determined what should be the iras @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) by applying a synthesized iras filter to the @xmath2 irs spectrum , using the synthesis tool in smart .",
    "the resulting irs @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) are listed in table 2 . in figure 6 , the iras @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) and the synthetic irs",
    "@xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) are compared .",
    "6 shows that the @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) from iras are always greater than the @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) measured with the @xmath2 irs , with a median factor of 1.6 and extending to a factor of 6 .",
    "the discrepancy increases with decreasing flux , so that the faintest sources show the largest ratio of iras to @xmath2 flux .",
    "various previous observations with comparable irs signal to noise indicate internal consistency of @xmath2 mips and irs fluxes at 24@xmath5 m  to within 5% @xcite , so irs flux calibration uncertainty is much less than the differences observed with iras fluxes .",
    "one possible source of difference arises when the iras source is larger than the irs slit so that so that some flux is omitted in the irs spectrum .",
    "this is the case for many nearby starbursts in @xcite .",
    "images of the fsc sources were obtained at @xmath3 25@xmath5 m  because acquisition of sources used the irs red peakup camera , and all images show an unresolved source as evidenced by the presence of a diffraction ring .",
    "this indicates that extended sources can not explain the differences between iras and irs fluxes .",
    "we conclude that the differences between iras and irs fluxes arise because many of these sources are near the detection limit for the iras fsc .",
    "6 shows that 14 of the iras fsc sources are actually fainter at 25 @xmath5 m , as measured by irs @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) , than the typical one sigma sensitivity limit of 65 mjy quoted for the fsc .",
    "this implies that these faint fsc `` detections '' are spurious , perhaps accidental noise spikes .",
    "therefore , we use the ratio iras @xmath4(25 @xmath5m)/irs @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) to estimate the reality of the iras fsc source . if this ratio is @xmath6 1.5 , we assume the source is really detected in the iras fsc , because flux discrepancies of this amount are reasonable for the faint fsc sources .",
    "also , this is the approximate flux ratio at which the iras fsc fluxes fall below the 65 mjy sensitivity limit in figure 6 . by this criterion , 14 ( 50% ) of the sources are real fsc detections ( counting the blazar for which the flux discrepancy is attributed to variability ) .    if half of the fsc infrared sources are not real , why did all of the fsc sources appear as @xmath2 sources ?",
    "we believe that the answer is because the requirement of a first radio source at the iras fsc position was also a criterion for source selection . as shown below",
    ", @xmath2 sensitivities are such that a @xmath2 source should be detected for any radio source brighter than the first limit , regardless of whether the source was actually detected in the iras fsc .",
    "the ratio of infrared to radio flux is described by the parameter q = log[@xmath4(25 @xmath5m)/@xmath4(1.4 ghz ) ] .",
    "the median q = 0.8 for faint @xmath2 sources detected at both 24@xmath5 m  and 1.4 ghz @xcite , and this is also the q value expected from previously known radio - infrared correlations for starbursts @xcite .",
    "the first catalogue includes sources to a point - source limit of 1 mjy for typical one sigma rms of 0.13 mjy @xcite .",
    "this limit means that a @xmath2 source would have been found with @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) @xmath13 6 mjy for any first source with q @xmath13 0.8",
    ". such a source would be detectable by the peakup pointing of @xmath2 , and an irs spectrum would be obtained , even if the fsc detection were not real .",
    "this result means that any first source with an infrared to radio ratio exceeding the median expected value would be detected in our @xmath2 pointings .",
    "the existence of a first source makes it probable , therefore , that a detectable @xmath2 source would be found even if the fsc source used for the initial identification were not real .",
    "this explains why @xmath2 sources were always found at the first position even in those cases when the @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) are too faint for the fsc detection to be real .",
    "spectra of the fsc sample are shown in figures 1 through 4 , ordered by @xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) , with lowest luminosity sources shown first .",
    "this ordering allows some overall spectral trends to be seen .",
    "sources with the strongest pah features and weakest silicate absorption ( sources 15 , 5 , and 7 ) are among the lowest luminosity sources , in figure 1 . sources of intermediate luminosity , in figures 2 and 3 , generally show conspicuous silicate absorption and weak pah features .",
    "finally , the highest luminosity sources ( figure 4 ) have the weakest silicate absorption and the weakest pah features .    as a comparison standard throughout",
    ", we use the thoroughly studied ulirg markarian 231 because its mid infrared spectrum @xcite is similar in shape to many other absorbed sources . in figure 5",
    ", we show this similarity by comparing the average spectrum of all the fsc sources in table 2 having silicate absorption to the spectrum of markarian 231 .",
    "the average absorption depth is similar to that of markarian 231 , for which the silicate optical depth of -0.7 corresponds to maximum extinction by the silicate feature of @xmath3 50% of the continuum flux .",
    "the distribution of continuum luminosities for the fsc sources is shown in figure 7 , based on @xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "this parameter is chosen for comparison to the large samples of ulirgs , sy1 , sy2 , and qsos summarized in @xcite .",
    "all of these sources previously observed with the irs have log[@xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) ] @xmath6 46.1 , and the median ulirg luminosity is log[@xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) ] = 44.4 .",
    "the luminosity limit of these previously observed sources is exceeded by 3 of the fsc sources .",
    "the most luminous obscured sources at z @xmath3 2 @xcite have log[@xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) ] @xmath6 46.6 @xcite , and this extreme luminosity is matched by one of the fsc sources .",
    "the median luminosity of the fsc sources in figure 7 is log[@xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) ] = 44.8 .",
    "these results indicate , therefore , that the fsc sample encompasses a luminosity range which includes typical ulirgs and extends to the most luminous sources discovered by @xmath2 .",
    "one objective of the present study was to assemble a sample of iras sources substantially fainter in infrared and optical flux than the luminous ulirgs defined by the iras 1 jy survey @xcite whose irs spectra are discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "objectives include learning how the nature of iras sources changes as flux becomes fainter , and especially to seek sources that are more similar in luminosity and redshift to the high - redshift sources discovered in @xmath2 surveys of sources at @xmath3 1 mjy .",
    "the fsc sample was chosen to have the faintest optical magnitudes that could be found in the fsc in order to select the iras sources with the most extreme values of observed infrared to optical flux ratio ( ir / opt ) .",
    "the faint @xmath2 samples in bootes @xcite and the fls @xcite have typical @xmath11 @xmath3 25 mag and @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) @xmath3 1 mjy . in the observer s frame",
    ", objects having similar ir / opt in the fsc , with typical @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) @xmath3 100 mjy , should have @xmath11 @xmath13 20 mag .",
    "very few fsc objects are so faint and so extreme in ir / opt , but all sources in table 1 have photographic @xmath0 @xmath13 18 .",
    "( we assume within the magnitude uncertainties that @xmath0 and @xmath11 are similar ) .",
    "figure 8 compares the fsc sample and the ulirg samples in 25@xmath5 m  flux and redshift ( using the @xmath2 irs @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) for the fsc sources and the iras @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) for the ulirg sources ) .",
    "the fsc sample extends to higher redshifts than the previously published ulirg samples which have irs spectra .",
    "the maximum redshift of the fsc sample is 0.93 with median redshift of 0.25 whereas the ulirg samples tabulated by @xcite and @xcite have maximum z of 0.26 .",
    "the combined dataset extends over a range of nearly 1000 in @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "the ratio of mid - infrared to optical or near - infrared flux is a measure of how much a source is dominated by dust absorption and dust continuum luminosity . in general , very dusty sources will have ratios enhanced both by increased extinction of shorter wavelengths and increased dust continuum at longer wavelengths , although detailed understanding of individual sources requires modeling of the dust absorption and emission contributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for comparing fluxes at different wavelengths among samples ,",
    "homogeneous all - sky data measuring optical magnitudes for iras sources are not available other than the photographic magnitudes used for our initial selection . however , the 2mass survey @xcite encompasses all sources in the ulirg samples and most sources in our fsc sample with near - infrared j , h , k photometry .    in figure 9 ,",
    "the flux distributions at 25@xmath5 m  and ratio @xmath4(25 @xmath5m)/@xmath4(j ) for the fsc sample are compared with the ulirg samples in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( the flux transformation adopted for 2mass j mag is that zero magnitude corresponds to 1590 jy . )",
    "the median for the combined ulirg samples is @xmath4(25 @xmath5m)/@xmath4(j ) = 2.42 and is the same for the fsc sample , counting limits .",
    "although the fsc sample was chosen for faint optical magnitudes , this similarity in @xmath4(25 @xmath5m)/@xmath4(j ) indicates that the fsc sample does not select in favor of sources with a greater dust content compared to the ulirg samples",
    ". the fsc sample does contain sources at greater redshifts than the @xcite and @xcite ulirg samples , as shown in fig .",
    "8 , although this result arises in part because the @xcite sample was restricted to ulirgs with z @xmath6 0.15",
    ".      one major objective of previous ulirg studies has been to determine the relative contributions of starbursts and agn to the total luminosity of a source .",
    "a division of luminosity between starbursts and agn at rest frame @xmath3 6@xmath5 m  can be determined by the strength of the pah features compared to the continuum , as measured by the equivalent width ( ew ) of the pah features @xcite .",
    "pure starbursts with no indicators of agn at any wavelength have rest frame ew(6.2 @xmath5 m ) @xmath13 0.45 @xcite .",
    "smaller equivalent widths correspond to an increasing continuum , assumed to be caused by an agn .",
    "very few ulirgs have such strong pah features ; only 2 of 49 in @xcite and 8 of 107 in @xcite , which indicates a substantial agn contribution to the continuum at 6@xmath5 m  .",
    "the distribution of pah strength for the fsc sample is shown in figure 7 ; only one of 28 sources has 6.2@xmath5 m  ew @xmath13 0.45 and only three have ew @xmath13 0.2 .",
    "these results indicate that , as in the ulirg samples , the near - infrared continuum is generally much stronger relative to the pah feature than in pure starbursts .",
    "it is also seen in figure 7 that the most luminous sources at rest frame 5.5@xmath5 m  in the fsc sample are sources with the smallest pah equivalent widths .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these results is that the most luminous near - infrared sources are dominated by agn power .",
    "how the luminosity divides in the near - infrared between agn and starbursts is not necessarily the same as the separation of starburst and agn power for bolometric luminosities .",
    "many efforts have been made to separate the bolometric contributions within ulirgs of agn and starbursts by assuming templates for the total agn spectrum and the total starburst spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general",
    ", results are that the far infrared luminosity from cooler dust is attributed primarily to the starburst whereas the near infrared luminosity from warmer dust is attributed to an agn .",
    "the warmer agn contribution leads to stronger near infrared continuum than from starbursts , causing the low equivalent widths for pah features .",
    "assumed templates can be incorrect if , for example , there is cooler dust outside of the dusty torus which is also heated by the agn , or if starbursts are deeply buried in optically thick clouds that produce hotter dust ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the templates may be examples of observed sources , but the intrinsic nature of the template sources may not be fully understood .",
    "it is desirable , therefore , to determine an estimate of agn and starburst contributions which is independent of template assumptions .",
    "for the rest frame parameters @xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) and l(6.2 @xmath5 m ) , which are measured for our sources in table 3 , empirical determinations relate these parameters to the bolometric luminosities of obscured agn [ l@xmath15(agn ) ] and of starbursts [ l@xmath15(sb ) ] . for local starbursts",
    "@xcite and high redshift submillimeter galaxies which are starbursts @xcite , an empirical relation has been found to be log[l@xmath15(sb ) ] = log[l(6.2 @xmath5m)]+ 2.7@xmath160.1 ; l(6.2 @xmath5 m ) is the total luminosity of the 6.2@xmath5 m  pah feature , after subtracting the underlying continuum .",
    "this result derives from an observational comparison of pah luminosity and bolometric luminosity ; while there may be some extinction of the 6.2@xmath5 m  feature , effects of extinction would be included in the empirical result . adopting this",
    "relation also assumes that l(6.2 @xmath5 m ) is measured the same in all sources .",
    "the uncertainty listed does not include the @xmath3 10% systematic uncertainty in measurement of 6.2@xmath5 m  fluxes that may arise from differences in the fitting procedure discused in section 2.2 .",
    "@xcite state that their measures are `` consistent '' with those of @xcite , to which we also compare in section 2.2 .",
    "because our measures agree within 10% of the brandl measures , we adopt the relation in @xcite without applying a systematic correction .",
    "this relation applies to a `` pure '' starburst , with no agn contribution to infrared luminosity .    for agn",

    "sources are assumed to be unresolved so the peak @xmath4(1.4 ghz ) is used . for the fsc sources ,",
    "the peak flux typically differs by @xmath3 10% from integrated fluxes . as discussed in section 3.1 , the much higher s / n and higher spatial resolution of the @xmath2 detections gives more accurate photometry at 25 @xmath5 m than the iras fsc fluxes so the irs @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) are used to determine q.    the comparison of q and @xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) is shown in figure 11 .",
    "larger values of q correspond to relatively weaker radio sources .",
    "the median value of q for the fsc sample is 1.25 .",
    "this is larger than the median of q = 0.8 for faint @xmath2 first look survey sources detected at both 24@xmath5 m  and 1.4 ghz @xcite , which is the q value expected from previously known radio - infrared correlations for starbursts @xcite .",
    "the median q is even less , q = 0.4 , for faint sources in the @xmath2 first look survey which have irs spectra and z @xmath13 1 in @xcite",
    ". some of these differences may be redshift effects .",
    "for example , markarian 231 ( shown in figure 9 ) has q = 1.6 but , if at z = 2 , would have q = 0.6 .    the results in fig .",

    "28 of these sources have been observed with the infrared spectrograph on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 fluxes indicate that about half of the sources have @xmath4(25 @xmath5 m ) which are below the iras fsc flux limit .",
    "this indicates that about half of the optically faint sources taken from the fsc are actually spurious fsc detections .",
    "these sources are nevertheless detected by @xmath2 because the presence of a first radio source also provides an infrared source of sufficient brightness for a @xmath2 detection .",
    "this fsc sample reaches to higher redshifts and higher luminosities than the iras - discovered ulirg samples observed spectroscopically with @xmath2 , and overlaps the luminosity range of @xmath2-discovered 24@xmath5 m  sources at z @xmath3 2 .",
    "the fsc sources have 0.12 @xmath6 z @xmath6 1.0 and luminosities 43.3 @xmath6 log[@xmath8l@xmath9(5.5 @xmath5 m ) ] @xmath6 46.7 .",
    "15 of the sources have detectable pah features , and 19 have measurable silicate absorption .",
    "median properties of the sample having silicate absorption are very similar to the ulirg markarian 231 in silicate strength , continuum luminosity , ratio @xmath4(25 @xmath5m)/@xmath4(j ) , and relative radio luminosity .",
    "pah luminosities are used to determine the starburst luminosity within each source , and predictions from dusty torus models are used to determine the agn luminosity .",
    "sources have similar bolometric luminosities arising from starbursts and from agn and are equally divided between sources dominated by starbursts and sources dominated by agn .",
    "the ratio of infrared to radio flux is not a measure of whether sources are dominated in the infrared by starburst or agn luminosity .",
