    "the use of air injection as a method of enhanced oil recovery has been explored for a long time @xcite . in this method ,",
    "part of oil burns with the injected air , increasing the well temperature and lowering the oil viscosity , thus enhancing its mobility .",
    "traditionally , air injection has been used to recover heavy oils , i.e. , oils with a very high viscosity . in this case ,",
    "chemical reactions crack the oil into a non - volatile part ( coke ) and volatile components , which are expelled from the high temperature region  @xcite .",
    "the exothermic reaction between the coke and the oxygen leads to formation of a high - temperature oxidation ( hto ) wave that propagates in the porous rock .",
    "the method of air injection has also been reported to increase recovery rates of light oils @xcite . in this case ,",
    "thermal expansion and gas drive promoted by the oxidation reaction are responsible for enhancing the recovery of oil .",
    "the reaction that takes place between light oil and injected oxygen occurs at lower temperatures , bounded by the boiling point ; it is termed as low - temperature oxidation ( lto ) .",
    "multicomponent nature of oil is essential for the structure of the resulting combustion wave , as it was shown recently with a simplified two - component model  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop a mathematical theory for the liquid - gas filtration combustion in the full multicomponent formulation .",
    "as opposed to the theory of hto , which usually considers a single - phase gas flow @xcite , our problem is based on a two - phase flow model  @xcite because the liquid fuel is also mobile .",
    "furthermore , the mathematical formulation must take into account not only oxidation , but also vaporization and condensation of the volatile fuel . even though a practical problem is intrinsically multidimensional , the use of one - dimensional models allows for the analytical study of fundamental characteristics  @xcite .",
    "it was shown with a simplified ( single pseudo - component ) model that the wave parameters ( speed and temperature ) must be extracted from the analysis of internal wave profile @xcite , following from the conditions at a singularity , a so - called resonance point .",
    "physically , this resonance point is determined by the coincidence between the combustion wave speed and the saturation ( buckley  leverett ) characteristic speed .    in this paper we study traveling wave solutions for a system of balance laws in one space dimension , modeling two - phase reactive flow with a multi - component liquid fuel .",
    "the problem is reduced to finding a heteroclinic orbit between two limiting constant states , which is defined by a vector field on a folded manifold in configuration space .",
    "since the limiting states are on different sides of the fold and a generic orbit can not pass the fold line , an extra singularity condition follows .",
    "this leads to a requirement that the orbit must pass through a resonance point on the fold line .",
    "such a property provides a missing determining condition for the combustion wave parameters , reducing the solution to a system of explicit algebraic equations . for a specific problem ,",
    "this system can be easily solved numerically , as we demonstrate with an example of 3-component oil model .",
    "note that traveling wave solutions with an internal singularity at the resonance point are known also as the pathological  @xcite or canard  @xcite case .",
    "their appearance in natural phenomena , though rather rare , ranges from astrophysics  @xcite to combustion and thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "a mathematical theory of this singularity is developed for the simplest case of one balance law  @xcite , but a completely understanding and classification are missing in the case of systems of balance laws . note that the traveling wave under consideration connects distant zeros of source terms in balance laws , which distinguishes this case from hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation  @xcite .",
    "we hope that our results will motivate further studies of this phenomenon both in the area of pure mathematics and applications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmodel ]",
    "we present the model formulation and in section  [ sec : cc ] we identify the wave structure that arises for large times . in section  [ sec : conl ]",
    "we obtain the unknown limiting states , while [ sec : wprof ] is devoted to obtaining the internal wave profiles and determining the overall structure and fold singularity . in section  [ sec.one ]",
    "we describe the hypersurface for the case of a single - component oil , obtaining the missing condition at the singularity , and in section  [ sec.ncomp ] we generalize the results for the @xmath0-component case .",
    "finally , we provide a numerical example in section  [ sec : numer ] and present the conclusions in section  [ sec.conc ]",
    "we consider a system of balance laws that describes the two - phase ( liquid and gas ) flow in porous medium , with reactions and phase transitions .",
    "the liquid has an arbitrary number of components , @xmath0 , representing a detailed model for complex fluids . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the recovery of light oil by air injection as a major application , where intense multi - component effects were reported  @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional problem with spatial coordinate @xmath1 and time @xmath2 . as dependent variables",
    ", we consider a temperature @xmath3 , a total darcy velocity @xmath4 , a saturation of liquid ( oleic ) phase , @xmath5 ( with a saturation of the gaseous phase @xmath6 ) , and fractions of all components in each phase .",
    "the oleic phase contains @xmath0 components , and we consider volume fractions for each component @xmath7 , with the last component described by @xmath8 . in the gaseous phase ,",
    "we distinguish @xmath0 oil components with molar fractions @xmath9 and the fraction of oxygen denoted by @xmath10 ; the remaining gaseous components with fraction @xmath11 consist of reaction products and inert components of the injected gas .",
    "note that volume fractions are the same as molar fractions in the ideal gas .",
    "we will adopt the notations @xmath12 and @xmath13 for oil components . in summary , there are @xmath14 dependent variables in the problem : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "balance laws will be constructed for each oil and gas component and heat , with two types of source terms : phase transitions ( vaporization or condensation ) and reactions .",
    "we use the following simplified reaction model : @xmath18 which means that one mole of oxygen reacts with @xmath19 moles of @xmath20th oil component in oleic phase generating @xmath21 moles of gaseous products such as h@xmath22o , co@xmath22 , etc .",
    "gaseous phase reactions are disregarded , which is typical for petroleum applications due to annihilation of free radicals at pore walls  @xcite .",

    "darcy velocities of every component in both phases ( neglecting mass diffusion ) are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are darcy velocities of the oleic and gas phase . with the unknown total darcy velocity @xmath41",
    ", we express the phase velocities as @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the oil fractional flow function , which is a given function of the dependent variables . as a function of oil saturation , @xmath44 has a characteristic s - shape ( see fig .

[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",

    "the temperature profile @xmath52 along the wave shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.xi](b ) is obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqone.text ] ) and it confirms that the temperature profile decays monotonously in the downstream direction . from figs . [ fig.xi](a ) and ( b ) one can see that the heavier component is expelled from the wave in the downstream direction .",
    "this counterintuitive property results in leaving the more volatile component in the wave , and particularly at the resonance point .",
    "hence , the important physical processes occurring in the resonance point , i.e. , oxidation and vaporization , are largely determined by the lightest component of the oleic mixture . in our example ,",
    "the properties of heptane ( lighter component ) determines the wave parameters , i.e. , combustion temperature , wave speed and downstream saturation .",

    "the representation in a ternary plot is usual in multiphase flows in porous media , see , for instance @xcite .",
    "one can see that at the resonance point the oil is mostly composed by the lightest component @xmath53 , for all initial oleic compositions .     and ( b ) @xmath49 .",

    "the composition is not defined for @xmath50 in ( b ) , where @xmath55.,title=\"fig : \" ]        the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.xi ] and [ fig.triangle ] show that the composition at the resonance point is dominated by the lightest component of the oil , regardless of the initial oleic composition .",
    "therefore , if the lightest component is kept fixed , it is expected that changing the heavier components will not change significantly the results .",
    "in fact , changing @xmath56 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 yields a difference in the wave speed of less than @xmath59 .",
    "a profile of a nonlinear traveling wave is associated with a heteroclinic orbit for a respective vector field . for a system of balance laws in one space dimension , such a vector field",
    "is defined implicitly and , therefore , may have singularities ( folds ) at points , where equations can not be resolved with respect to derivatives .",
    "since a generic orbit can not pass the folding line , extra conditions are imposed on the traveling wave at the singular point .",
    "examples of such waves though relatively rare are known for long time , e.g. , the pathological detonation  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical theory is developed for a single balance law  @xcite .",
    "however , this theory does not generalize directly to systems of balance laws and , apart from the studies for specific models , the full mathematical theory is still missing , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we study one more example of this singularity in a combustion wave .",

    "as the main result , this work shows that the singularity represents a clue to the analytical solution for the combustion wave , despite a tremendous complexity of the model . the mathematical technique that we propose",
    "is based on splitting the wave profile into the equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium regions , and identifying the fold singularity in between .",
    "such splitting is approximate : it is valid asymptotically in the limit of large source terms . with the singularity analysis , we provide a full set of determining equations for all wave parameters .    for applications",

    "it also reveals some important properties of the solution : the oil composition becomes much lighter in the region of high temperatures , with a weak dependence on initial concentrations .",
