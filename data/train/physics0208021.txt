    "recently , there has been considerable interest in viewing the coupled solar wind - magnetosphere as a complex system where multi - scale coupling is a fundamental aspect of the dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "examples of the observational motivation for this approach are i ) bursty transport events in the magnetotail @xcite and ii ) evidence that the statistics of these events are self - similar ( as seen in auroral images @xcite ) .",
    "geomagnetic indices are of particular interest in this context as they provide a global measure of magnetospheric output and are evenly sampled over a long time interval .",
    "there is a wealth of literature on the magnetosphere as an input - output system ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "recent work has focussed on comparing some aspects of the scaling properties of input parameters such as @xmath0 @xcite and the ae index @xcite to establish whether , to the lowest order , they are directly related @xcite .",
    "although these studies are directed at understanding the coupled solar wind - magnetosphere in the context of self - organized criticality ( soc ) , a comprehensive comparison of the scaling properties of the indices , and some proxy for the driver ( @xmath0 ) also has relevance for the predictability of this magnetospheric  output \" from the input .",
    "importantly , both  burstiness \" ( or intermittency ) and self - similarity can arise from several processes including soc and turbulence .",
    "indeed , soc models exhibit threshold instabilities , bursty flow events and statistical features consistent with the  scale - free \" dynamics such as power law power spectra .",
    "it has been proposed by @xcite that magnetospheric dynamics are indeed in the critical state or near it .",
    "alternatively , @xcite used the castaing distribution  the empirical model derived in @xcite and based on a turbulent energy cascade  to obtain a two parameter functional form for the probability density functions ( pdf ) of the ae fluctuations on various temporal scales .",
    "turbulent descriptions of magnetospheric measures also model observed statistical intermittency , i.e. , the presence of large deviations from the average value on different scales @xcite . an increased probability of finding such large deviations is manifested in the departure of the pdf from gaussian toward a leptokurtic distribution @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will quantify both the intermittency and the self - similarity of the au , al , ae and @xmath0 time series using the technique of finite size scaling .",
    "this has the advantage of being model independent , and is also directly related to both turbulence models such as that of castaing @xcite and a fokker - planck description of the time series .",
    "the method was used in @xcite where the mono - scaling of the solar wind magnetic energy density fluctuations was reported .",
    "we will find that fluctuations in all four quantities are strongly suggestive of turbulent processes and by quantifying this we can compare their properties directly .    the al , au and ae indices data set investigated here comprises over @xmath3 million , @xmath4 minute averaged samples from january 1978 to january 1979 inclusive .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter defined in si units as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is an estimate of the fraction of the solar wind poynting flux through the dayside magnetosphere and was calculated from the wind spacecraft key parameter database @xcite .",
    "it comprises over @xmath4 million , @xmath8 second averaged samples from january 1995 to december 1998 inclusive .",
    "the data set includes intervals of both slow and fast speed streams .",
    "the time series of indices and that of the @xmath0 parameter were obtained in different time intervals and here we assume that the samples are long enough to be statistically accurate .",
    "the statistical properties of complex systems can exhibit a degree of universality reflecting the lack of a characteristic scale in their dynamics .",
    "a connection between the statistical approach and the dynamical one is given by a fokker - planck ( f - p ) equation @xcite which describes the dynamics of the pdf and , in the most general form , can be written as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a pdf of some quantity @xmath11 that varies with time @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the friction coefficient and @xmath14 is a diffusion coefficient which in this case can vary with @xmath11 . for certain choices of @xmath14 , a class of self - similar solutions of ( [ eq1 ] ) satisfies a finite size scaling ( in the usage of @xcite , pg .",
    "85 , henceforth  scaling \" ) relation given by : @xmath15 this scaling is a direct consequence of the fact that the f - p equation is invariant under the transformation @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "if , for given experimental data , a set of pdfs can be constructed , on different temporal scales @xmath18 , that satisfy relation ( [ eq2 ] ) then a diffusion coefficient and corresponding f - p equation can be found to represent the data .",
    "a simple example is the brownian random walk with @xmath19 , @xmath20constant and gaussian pdfs on all scales .",
    "alternatively one can treat the identification of the scaling exponent @xmath21 and , as we will see , the non - gaussian nature of the rescaled pdfs ( @xmath22 ) as a method for quantifying the intermittent character of the time series . practically , obtaining",
    "the rescaled pdfs involves finding a rescaling index @xmath21 directly from the integrated time series of the quantity @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath24 represent the time series of the studied signal , in our case au , al , ae or the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "a set of time series @xmath25 is obtained for each value of non - overlapping time lag @xmath18 .",
    "the pdf @xmath26 is then obtained for each time series @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows these pdfs for the @xmath28 .",
    "a generic scaling approach is applied to these pdfs .",
    "ideally , we use the peaks of the pdfs to obtain the scaling exponent @xmath21 , as the peaks are the most populated parts of the distributions . in certain cases ,",
    "however , the peaks may not be the optimal statistical measure for obtaining the scaling index .",
    "for example , the @xmath29 component in ( [ eps ] ) as well as the au and al indices are measured with an absolute accuracy of about @xmath30 nt .",
    "such discreteness in the time series and , in the case of the @xmath0 fluctuations , the large dynamical range introduce large errors in the estimation of the peak values @xmath31 and may not give a correct scaling .",
    "since , if the pdfs rescale , we can obtain the scaling exponent from any point on the curve in principle , we also determine the scaling properties of the standard deviation @xmath32 of each curve @xmath33 versus @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows @xmath31 plotted versus @xmath18 on log - log axes for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath28 and @xmath36 .",
    "straight lines on such a plot suggest that the rescaling ( [ eq2 ] ) holds at least for the peaks of the distributions . on figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "lines were fitted with @xmath37 goodness of fit for the range of @xmath18 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 minutes , omitting points corresponding to the first two temporal scales as in these cases the sharp peaks of the pdfs can not be well resolved .",
    "the lines suggest self - similarity persists up to intervals of @xmath40 minutes .",
    "the slopes of these lines yield the exponents @xmath21 and these are summarized in table 1 along with the values obtained from analogous plots of @xmath32 versus @xmath18 which show the same scale break .",
    "we note that , for the @xmath0 parameter , the scaling index @xmath21 obtained from the @xmath31 is different from the hurst exponent measured from the @xmath32 .",
    "this difference could be a result of the previously discussed difficulties with the @xmath0 data .",
    "however , it does appear to be a feature of some real time series ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "indeed , such a difference between index @xmath21 and @xmath41 is predicted in the case of fractional lvy motion @xcite .",
    "= 0.48    we see that , for the @xmath0 as well as the al and au indices , there is a range of @xmath18 up to @xmath42 hours for which @xmath31 plotted versus @xmath18 is well described by a power law @xmath43 with indices @xmath44 for the @xmath0 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the al and au indices , respectively .",
    "thus the break in scaling at @xmath47 hours in the al and au indices may have its origin in the solar wind , although the physical reason for the break at this timescale in epsilon is unclear .",
    "the break in the ae index , however , appears to occur at a smaller temporal scale of @xmath48 hours , consistent with the scaling break timescale found in the same index by other analysis methods @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted by @xcite as due to the characteristic substorm duration .",
    "@xcite also reported a scaling break at the same @xmath49 hour timescale for al , in contrast to the @xmath47 hour timescale found here .",
    "indeed , one might have expected a substorm timescale to cause the same scaling break in both the ae and al indices , because their substorm signatures are so similar in profile ( e.g. , figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the resolution may lie in the difference between analysis of differenced and undifferenced data @xcite .",
    ".scaling indices derived from @xmath31 and @xmath32 power laws . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     within this scaling range we now attempt to collapse each corresponding unscaled pdf onto a single master curve using the scaling ( [ eq2 ] ) . if the initial assumption of the self - similar solutions is correct , a single parameter rescaling , given by equation ( [ eq2 ] ) for a mono - fractal process , would give a perfect collapse of pdfs on all scales .",
    "practically , an approximate collapse of pdfs is an indicator of a dominant mono - fractal trend in the time series , i.e. , this method may not be sensitive enough to detect multi - fractality that could be present only during short time intervals .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the result of the one parameter rescaling applied to the unscaled pdf of the @xmath50 and the @xmath28 index fluctuations , respectively , for the temporal scales up to @xmath51 hours .",
    "we see that the rescaling procedure ( [ eq2 ] ) using the value of the exponent @xmath21 of the peaks @xmath31 shown in fig [ fig2 ] , gives good collapse of each curve onto a single common functional form for the entire range of the data .",
    "these rescaled pdfs are leptokurtic rather than a gaussian and are thus strongly suggestive of an underlying turbulent process .",
    "= 0.48    = 0.48    the successful rescaling of the pdfs now allows us to perform a direct comparison of the pdfs for all four quantities .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows these normalized pdfs @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath35 and @xmath54 hour overlaid on a single plot .",
    "the @xmath55 variable has been normalized to the rescaled standard deviation @xmath56 of @xmath22 in each case to facilitate this comparison .",
    "we then find that ae and @xmath0 fluctuations have indistinguishable @xmath22 . the pdfs of @xmath28 and @xmath36 are asymmetric such that @xmath57 fits @xmath28 pdf closely ( see insert in the figure [ fig5 ] ) ; when overlaid on the pdfs of the @xmath50 and @xmath35 these are also indistinguishable within errors .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the dominant contributions to the ae indices come from the eastward and westward electrojets of the approximately symmetric dp2 current system that is driven directly by the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the mono - scaling of the investigated pdfs , together with the finite value of the samples variance , indicates that a fokker - planck approach can be used to study the dynamics of the unscaled pdfs within their temporal scaling range .",
    "in this paper we have applied the generic and model independent scaling method to study the scaling of fluctuations in the @xmath0 parameter and the global magnetospheric indices au , al and ae . the similar values of the scaling exponent and the leptokurtic nature of the single pdf that , to within errors , describes fluctuations on time scales up to @xmath58 in all four quantities provide an important quantitative constraint for models of the coupled solar wind - magnetosphere system .",
    "one possibility is that , up to @xmath59 hours , fluctuations in au and al are directly reflecting those seen in the turbulent solar wind .",
    "the data also suggest that ae index departs from this scaling on shorter time scale of @xmath60 hours .",
    "importantly , identifying a close correspondence in the fluctuation pdf of @xmath0 , ae , au and al may simply indicate that fluctuations in the indices are strongly coupled to dayside processes and are thus weak indicators of the fluctuations in nightside energy output . the leptokurtic nature of the pdfs is strongly suggestive of turbulent processes , and in the case of au and al , these may then be either just that of the turbulent solar wind ( and here @xmath0 ) or may be locally generated turbulence which has an indistinguishable signature in its fluctuation pdf . in this case our results quantify the nature of this turbulence .",
    "we note , however , that certain classes of complex systems @xcite are in principle capable of  passing through \" input fluctuations into their output without being directly driven in the present sense [ chang , private communication , 2002 ] .",
    "finally , the rescaling also indicates that a fokker - planck approach can be used to study the evolution of the fluctuation pdf .",
    "this raises a possibility of a new approach to understanding magnetospheric dynamics .",
