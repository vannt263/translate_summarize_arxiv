    "since its discovery @xcite , the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy izw18 has been an exemplary low metallicity star forming galaxy and has undergone remarkable observational scrutiny .",
    "the galaxy hosts the lowest metallicity h  ii  regions known in the local universe , with oxygen abundances ( o / h ) @xmath6 0.02 ( o / h)@xmath4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sk93 ) . as such",
    ", the study of izw18 is essential in various astrophysical arenas , including dwarf galaxy evolution , primordial helium abundance measurements , and star formation mechanisms .    with an h  i  heliocentric radial velocity of 749 km sec@xmath7 ,",
    "a distance of @xmath6 10 mpc is usually assumed for izw18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggests a slightly larger value of @xmath6 12.6 mpc to account for virgocentric infall .",
    "the precise distance determination of izw18 is beyond the scope of this paper ; we follow @xcite in adopting a distance of 12.6 mpc , but note that this condition is uncertain and is worthy of extensive future study .",
    "the low metallicity of the izw18 system has led to the suggestion that it is undergoing its first burst of star formation @xcite .",
    "however , the uniformity of the nebular abundances derived by sk93 in the two main components of the system argues against this hypothesis .",
    "the evolutionary status of izw18 is of paramount importance , since the system offers the closest known reproduction of pristine conditions and therefore the best low metallicity environment in which to study big bang nucleosynthesis at low redshift .",
    "additional physical mechanisms have also been studied in detail in izw18 to discern their behavior at very low metallicities ( e.g. , heating and cooling balance , * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of previous generations of star formation within izw18 has not yet been fully characterized .",
    "interestingly , the nebular c / o ratio was found to be elevated in izw18 with respect to other comparably metal - poor irregular galaxies and above the predictions of massive star nucleosynthesis ( * ? ? ? * but see also izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "the implication of such an observation is that izw18 may have undergone a previous episode of star formation ; this conclusion is supported by the discovery of a population of 0.5 - 5 gyr old asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars from hst / nicmos imaging @xcite .",
    "cmd analysis by aloisi , tosi , & greggio ( 1999 ) also suggests the presence of evolved intermediate mass stars in the blue loop phase which may be as low as 3 - 4 m@xmath4 , implying ages of @xmath6 0.3 - 0.6 gyr .",
    "photometric investigations thus suggest that izw18 has an ( at least ) intermediate age stellar population and is thus not evolutionarily young .",
    "izw18 has been the target of deep hst studies since the launch of the spacecraft , and numerous archival studies have also been executed .",
    "the present new images complement and , where possible , improve on , previous works .",
    "imaging studies of the nebular emission ( h@xmath0 , he  ii ) were carried out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ht95 ) and @xcite .",
    "the former analyzed the stellar distribution and derived properties of the ionized gas distribution ( h  ii  region characteristics , age arguments ) .",
    "the latter used he  ii emission to characterize the population of wolf - rayet stars within the galaxy .",
    "this study adds to these works , in that we have deeper , higher resolution h@xmath0  imaging , and combine this with h@xmath1  imaging to derive reddening characteristics within the galaxy .",
    "this is the first imaging diagnostic of the internal extinction using hst data .",
    "previous evidence for dust in izw18 has come from several ground - based spectroscopic investigations wherein reddening is detected ( sk93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high spatial resolution afforded by these wfpc2 images allows us to explore the nature and spatial distribution of the dust and to address the possibility that the elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios arise from collisional excitation or underlying stellar absorption .    in this study",
    ", we seek to derive the dust properties of izw18 .",
    "the presence of dust at very low metallicities has implications both for the evolution of irregular and spiral galaxies , and also for cosmological models of structure formation in the present epoch .",
    "it is thus imperative that we understand all components of such systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ s2 ]",
    "we discuss the observations and their analysis .",
    "presentation of the new h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  images , and their analysis and errors , are the topic of   [ s3 ] . in   [ s4 ] we discuss the locations of areas rich in dust , the properties of that dust distribution , and the implications for the molecular gas content of the galaxy which this detection affords .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in   [ s5 ] .",
    "images were obtained with the wide field / planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) on 1998 april 4 and 1999 february 16 .",
    "in addition , archival wfpc2 data from programs go-5309 and go-5434 were retrieved from the stsci archive to create a comprehensive dataset covering a large wavelength regime . here",
    ", we discuss the h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  images , and their relevant continua from broad band images .",
    "a summary of the data used is presented in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "note that both h@xmath0  images were obtained using the f658n filter , because the redshift of the emission line gas in izw18 ( h@xmath0  heliocentric radial velocity range of 730 - 780 km sec@xmath7 , or z@xmath60.0025 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) places the 6563  h@xmath0  line in the range of peak sensitivity of the f658n filter . all reductions and analysis were performed in the iraf / stsdas environment .",
    "the data were initially processed through the standard hst pipeline .",
    "the pipeline - processed images were then corrected for geometric distortion , charge transfer efficiency , warm pixel effects , and cosmic ray contamination .",
    "the background level of each image was then removed manually .",
    "the archival broad band images were flux calibrated by multiplying by the image header keyword photflam ( erg sec@xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 ) , defined as the mean flux density that produces a count rate of 1 sec@xmath7 , and then dividing by the header keyword exptime ( length of exposure ) .",
    "the on - the - fly calibration scheme , implemented by stsci , ensures all header keywords contain the most appropriate values .    for the narrow band images , the photflam keyword was replaced by a synthetic value obtained by applying the synphot package ; here ,",
    "the photometric parameters of an observation passband are calculated individually .",
    "outputs which were used in the present analysis included the modified photometric calibration ( output parameter uresp ) , the filter width , and a correction for emission features which appear away from the peak of a filter s sensitivity curve .",
    "table  [ t2 ] contains uresp and photflam values for narrow band images , as well as the system response efficiency corrections which were applied .",
    "finally , all images were rotated and shifted into the orientation of the new wf3 h@xmath1   image .",
    "we find our registration to be accurate to within @xmath6 0.05   in the wf3 images ( 1 pixel = 0.0996 ) and to within @xmath6 0.03   in the pc images ( 1 pixel = 0.0455 ) .      for narrow band photometry ,",
    "the removal of the underlying stellar continuum is a crucial component of the data analysis .",
    "the contribution to the narrow band images from underlying continuum sources was found in a recursive manner .",
    "first , the narrow band image , which includes continuum contamination , was scaled by a factor roughly representative of the ratio of emission contained in the narrow bandpass to that contained in the total wide bandpass .",
    "typically , this scaling factor was of the order of a few percent .",
    "the resultant scaled image was then subtracted from the wide band image whose filter response curve most closely isolated the redshifted emission features in question , and which contained the fewest number of other significant emission lines . of course , this problem is unavoidable for certain of the emission line images , for example , [ ] and h@xmath1 . in such cases ,",
    "the narrow band images were combined prior to the iterative subtraction process .",
    "this procedure was repeated by using different scaling factors until the wide band image no longer retained significant diffuse structure which is indicative of emission line radiation .",
    "once this iterative procedure was completed , we were left with a pure continuum image , free from the line emission in question .",
    "this scaled continuum image was then subtracted from the original narrow band image(s ) to produce a pure emission line ( i.e. , continuum - subtracted ) map . in figures",
    "[ figcap1]a and [ figcap1]c , we show the pc h@xmath0  image and the underlying stellar continuum which was removed from it .",
    "the continuum scaling fraction was independently calculated using the synphot package .",
    "the throughputs of the narrow band and wide filters were found at the wavelengths of the redshifted emission lines .",
    "the ratio of throughputs was then multiplied by the ratio of effective filter widths .",
    "the fractions found by these two methods agree to better than one percent for both emission line images . in order to obtain the total amount of line emission from izw18",
    ", the pure emission line images were then multiplied by the fwhm of each filter , as calculated by synphot .",
    "we thus have an absolute calibration for the narrow band images . the continuum - subtracted images in h@xmath0  and h@xmath1",
    "are compared in figures  [ figcap1]a and [ figcap1]b , respectively . the total h@xmath0  flux from izw18 is found to be 3.26@xmath210@xmath9 erg sec@xmath7 @xmath8 , in excellent agreement with the value calculated by @xcite , 3.3@xmath210@xmath9 erg sec@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the ionized gas distribution of izw18 is well - resolved in the pc h@xmath0   image ( figure  [ figcap1]a ) .",
    "a wispy , filamentary structure with prominent shells dominates the morphology of the galaxy in the light of h@xmath0 . the very bright h@xmath0  concentration in the nw region is slightly offset from the peak of continuum emission ( compare figures  [ figcap1]a and [ figcap1]c ) .",
    "the southeast ( se ) region of the galaxy shows more bright knots in h@xmath0  than does the nw region , and less filamentary structure . we do detect a smaller shell in the se region , however ; as will be shown in ",
    "[ s4 ] , this area is also coincident with a prominent dust concentration .",
    "the relative shell sizes in the nw and se regions and the presence of more ob associations and less extended diffuse emission in the se region is in good agreement with the observations by ht95 and @xcite that this region contains younger stars than the nw component .",
    "the bright h  ii  regions in izw18 as revealed in the pc image are shown in figure  [ figcap2 ] and detailed in table  [ t3 ] in order of decreasing h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "our catalog compares well with that of ht95 ; all of our features are also detected and cataloged therein , except for se 13 , the least - luminous h  ii  region detected , which was not visible in their f656n filter h@xmath0  image .",
    "the continuum - subtracted h@xmath1  image ( figure  [ figcap1]b ) shows a very similar structure to the h@xmath0  image .",
    "the signal - to - noise here is lower than in the h@xmath0  image ( due to lower system throughput than the f658n filter ( roughly a factor of 2 less ) , a shorter integration time , and the intrinsically fainter h@xmath1  emission line strength ) , and produces the limiting uncertainty in the calculated reddening values across the galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "note the general agreement in morphology of the two images ; every filament of emission in h@xmath0  is also detected in h@xmath1 , down to the limit of the resolution in the latter image .",
    "resolution of fainter h  ii  regions is lost in the h@xmath1  image ( e.g. , se 13 ; see figures  [ figcap1]b & [ figcap2 ] , and table  [ t3 ] ) .",
    "regions with high photon counts ( i.e. , large equivalent widths , hereafter denoted by ew(h@xmath0 )  and ew(h@xmath1 )  for h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 , respectively ) in both h@xmath0and h@xmath1  were next analyzed using aperture photometry to determine fluxes .",
    "apertures were placed on identical regions in six different images : h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  fluxes , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  photon counts , and continuum images used for each filter . to make sure that we were obtaining proper flux calibration of the h@xmath0  images",
    ", we performed this procedure for both the wf3 and pc f658n filter images , with continuum images selected to match the original resolution ( i.e. , pc continuum image used for pc h@xmath0  continuum subtraction , and likewise for the wf3 image ) .",
    "table  [ t2 ] ( last two columns ) contains data on the continuum subtraction values used to determine aperture flux ratios .    upon preliminary analysis of the data",
    ", we found that using small circular apertures centered on the h  ii  regions ( i.e. , the apertures of the h  ii   regions as shown in figure  [ figcap2 ] and listed in table  [ t3 ] ) yielded unacceptably large errors for most of the catalogued h  ii  regions ; the sources of these errors are discussed below .",
    "for this reason , we chose to expand the apertures to larger polygons which included the majority of visible flux when overlaid on each image , encircled areas of only high ew(h@xmath0 )  and ew(h@xmath1 )   ( compare figures  [ figcap3]a and [ figcap1]d ) , and often contained multiple h  ii  regions in a single aperture .",
    "this technique minimizes potential errors caused by slight mis - registration of the images , and enhances the signal - to - noise ratio by increasing photon counts in each aperture ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "the locations of these larger polygonal apertures are shown in figure  [ figcap3]a .",
    "flux ratios were then calculated by dividing h@xmath0  fluxes by h@xmath1  fluxes in each aperture . in the absence of dust ,",
    "the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio is confined to a narrow range of values that is relatively insensitive to temperature and density .",
    "following sk93 , we adopt an electron temperature of 19,000 k for izw18 ; we thus expect h@xmath0/h@xmath1  = 2.76 , based on the balmer line ratios from @xcite .",
    "values that are elevated above this theoretical ratio are indicative of the presence of dust , which preferentially absorbs and scatters shorter wavelength radiation .",
    "we list in table  [ t4 ] the applied apertures , h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  fluxes , and flux ratios with errors .",
    "we note that all h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios are consistent with the expected minimum theoretical value , and that the small errors make the detections of dust significant .",
    "a potential major source of uncertainty in extragalactic reddening studies is the amount of foreground extinction due to gas and dust within the galaxy . at a galactic latitude of @xmath1045 , foreground extinction",
    "is expected to be low in izw18 . in the direction of izw18 , the ( 03@xmath206 resolution )",
    "maps of @xcite indicate a foreground extinction of e(b - v ) @xmath6 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "the more recent , higher resolution ( @xmath6 6@xmath11 fwhm ) study of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) indicates that a marginally higher value of e(b - v ) @xmath6 0.03 magnitudes is applicable .",
    "inspection of the extinction maps of this latter study indicates that there is no appreciable gradient in or fluctuation of e(b - v ) across the luminous extent of izw18 ; the average value applies over scales much larger than the field of view under study here ( e.g. , figures  [ figcap1](a)-(d ) ) , and the foreground extinction is smooth on these scales .    for the purposes of this study ,",
    "we seek to constrain the amount of internal extinction within izw18 . while there is a moderate amount of extinction between",
    "the observer and the galaxy , which we correct for in the following analysis , any variations in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratio observed are likely to be intrinsic to izw18 .",
    "although we can not rule out small - scale ( i.e. , arcsecond scales ) local maxima in the foreground extinction which may affect our interpretation , we favor the hypothesis that searching for variations in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratio allows us to constrain the nature of dust within izw18 itself .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite are consistent with values of 0 @xmath12 e(b - v ) @xmath12 0.03 ; we adopt an intermediate value of e(b - v ) @xmath13 0.02 .",
    "assuming r@xmath14 @xmath13 3.1 , we then have a foreground extinction of 0.06 magnitudes , which is small compared to our regions of highest detected extinction .",
    "following both of the aforementioned studies , we attach to this foreground value a 25% uncertainty , and propagate this through our final extinction values calculated in section  [ s4.1.1 ] .",
    "uncertainties were calculated for the observed reddening values by applying poisson statistics .",
    "we discuss other potential sources of error below ; however , this should represent an accurate measure of the final error in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio of the h@xmath1  wf3 image compared to the h@xmath0  image .",
    "this dominant error term limits which sections of the image , and hence what physical conditions , may be sampled for the presence of dust . for example , the central region of the nw shell can not be tested for the presence of dust , due to the fact that the number of detected h@xmath1  photons is too small to allow physically meaningful errors to be assigned .",
    "other sources of error in the flux calibration and image analysis procedures are discussed and deemed negligible as follows .",
    "we implicitly assume that removal of dc levels from images ( e.g. , background removal , scaling of images by numerical fractions ) does not affect the standard deviation of the image , and therefore does not affect the error terms derived .",
    "errors in continuum subtraction fractions were assessed by performing photometry on images with different continuum fractions than the final ones used .",
    "changing the continuum subtraction fractions is a second order effect compared to the errors in number of counts .",
    "the values which we apply for continuum subtraction are also supported by the fact that the derived h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios are all consistent with the lower limit theoretical ratio of 2.76 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and arguments below ) .",
    "furthermore , inspection of the continuum images ( after removal of the narrow band , ionized component ) reveals very little ionized gas remaining , indicating successful continuum subtraction ( see figures  [ figcap1]a and [ figcap1]c ) .",
    "we assume that the position angle of the wfpc2 camera is exactly known .",
    "rotation of the images into the orientation of the new wf3 images was accomplished using simple linear interpolation between pixels .",
    "this method was favored due to its simplicity ; we found no reason to apply more complicated interpolation schemes .",
    "shifting the rotated images to align with the narrow band images is not an error - free process ; as stated previously , we expect that image registration is accurate only to within a fraction of a pixel .",
    "using the aforementioned larger polygonal apertures ( see figure  [ figcap3]a ) , we obtain higher photon counting statistics , ensuring that the contribution to the final error terms due to image rotation and mis - registration are of second order or higher in all cases .",
    "in   [ s3 ] , we unambiguously detect elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios in various areas inside izw18 ( see table  [ t4 ] ) . in this section , we characterize the dust content and denote some implications for the evolutionary status and molecular gas content of izw18 .        we calculate reddening values for each aperture discussed in   [ s3 ] by applying the relation @xmath15 } \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the observed h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratio ,",
    "@xmath17 is the theoretical ratio ( 2.76 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the adopted temperature of 19,000 k ( sk93 ) , c is the logarithmic reddening correction at h@xmath1 , and @xmath18 (= -0.37 ) is calculated from the interstellar extinction curve of @xcite as specified by @xcite .",
    "we then find c and solve for the extinction in magnitudes by applying the conversion factor between c and a@xmath19 of @xcite , where a@xmath19 @xmath13 2.17  @xmath20  c. finally , we correct for 0.06 magnitudes of foreground extinction @xcite as discussed in   [ s3.2 ] . these values are also listed in table  [ t4 ] ; note that all extinctions are rather small , the largest being @xmath6 0.5 magnitudes , and a fiducial value being 0.2 magnitudes for the se region .",
    "thus , large spatial variations in internal extinction in izw18 are not sufficient to compromise previous nebular abundance studies ; however , the statistically significant elevation of some h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios indicates that appreciable amounts of dust do exist within the galaxy and merit further investigation .",
    "a potential difficulty in interpreting elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios as indicative of the presence of dust is the contribution from collisional excitation of h  i. @xcite and sk93 have discussed the possibility that the high electron temperatures in izw18 may lead to collisional excitation of the neutral hydrogen , which would affect the emission line ratios of some of the lower - level hydrogen transitions , most notably h@xmath0  and h@xmath1 .",
    "since this effect is directly proportional to the neutral hydrogen fraction , an observationally challenging quantity to measure , the importance of this effect has been difficult to assess .",
    "photoionization models by @xcite suggest that collisional excitation effects may affect the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio by as much as 11% in the nw region of izw18 .",
    "the distribution of enhanced h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios observed here argues against the importance of collisional excitation of the neutral hydrogen .",
    "most of the elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios are seen in the se component , which has a lower electron temperature than the nw region ( sk93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence of enhanced h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios in areas of expected lower ionization parameter ( i.e. , radial gradients around ionizing stars ) .",
    "thus , we interpret the regions which demonstrate elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios ( see further discussion below ) to be regions with enhanced extinction . while we can not rule out the possibility that collisional processes are making a limited contribution to the h@xmath0  emission in areas near uv - bright clusters ( e.g. , sections in the se region ; see figure  [ figcap3]a ) , the effect is minimal even in these regions .",
    "for example , apertures se d3 and se d4 ( see table  [ t4 ] and figure  [ figcap3]a ) are spatially separated by only 21.7 pc .",
    "the statistically different h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratio between the two suggests that , if collisional excitation is taking place , its effects are not severe enough to compromise the interpretation of the photometry of this study .    a second effect which may elevate h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios above the theoretical value is an error in the assumed electron temperature , t@xmath21 .",
    "if t@xmath21  is much lower than the adopted value , any elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios will be caused by the preferential excitation of the lower - energy h@xmath0  transition compared to h@xmath1 .",
    "sk93 find t@xmath21  to be lower in the se region than in the nw ( 17,200 @xmath22 1,200 k and 19,600 @xmath22 600 k , respectively ) .",
    "however , as will be shown below , we find h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios ( corrected for foreground extinction ) which are as high as 3.4 . to attain such ratios as a consequence of an overestimated t@xmath21 , the actual temperature would have to be as low as 2,500 k in some areas , and would have to vary on unphysically short spatial scales ( of order parsecs ) .",
    "neither of these effects are observed , nor are they predicted by models of the photoionization structure of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that errors in the adopted t@xmath21  provide a negligible error contribution in the following analysis .    finally , it is possible that underlying stellar absorption may affect the pure emission line images . in regions with low ew(h@xmath0 )  and",
    "ew(h@xmath1 ) , underlying stellar balmer absorption may lower the h@xmath1  emission line flux relative to h@xmath0 , simulating the effect of dust . to look for this effect we have tabulated the ew(h@xmath1 )  and ew(h@xmath0 )  for each of our measured regions ; figure  [ figcap1]d shows the smoothed ew(h@xmath0 )  map .",
    "if underlying absorption were important , one would expect an anti - correlation between the measured extinction and the ew(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "in fact , the data in table  [ t4 ] do show weak evidence of this trend .",
    "a regression of a@xmath14 on ew(h@xmath1 )  yields a correlation coefficient of -0.5 .",
    "this is not direct evidence that some of the enhancement in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio is due to underlying stellar absorption ( it may be that dust is found preferentially associated with lower surface brightness stellar populations ) , but the effect does need to be considered . from the modeling of @xcite , the ew(h@xmath1 )  of an",
    "instantaneous burst rises monotonically from @xmath6 3   to @xmath6 10   for ages of 0 to 200 myr . in a constant star formation model ew(h@xmath1 )  rises monotonically from @xmath6 3   to @xmath6 6   over the same period .",
    "if we could be confident that all of the stars in izw18 were younger than 20 myr , then an upper limit of 6   ew(h@xmath1 )  of underlying h@xmath1  absorption would be reasonable .",
    "if there are stars older than this in izw18 , then the continuous star formation model would be more appropriate ( which has a maximum value of @xmath6 8   ew(h@xmath1)for ages of @xmath6 0.5 gyr and higher ) . for our lowest ew(h@xmath1 )  regions ( @xmath675 to @xmath6100  ) , some , if not most , of the enhancement in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1   ratio could be due to underlying stellar absorption if it were mixed with an intermediate age stellar population .",
    "however , for the regions with a@xmath14 in excess of 0.15 ( h@xmath0/h@xmath1  @xmath13 3.00 ) it is unlikely that the enhancement in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1ratio could be due solely to underlying stellar absorption .",
    "note that in several regions ( with ew(h@xmath1 )  @xmath13 120 to 160  , see table  [ t4 ] ) the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio is consistent with no reddening ( and thus no effect of underlying absorption ) .",
    "thus , while we can not completely rule out some enhancement in the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio due to underlying stellar absorption , we can rule out that it is the dominant effect in the regions where we have the highest h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios .",
    "since these regions are the focus of what follows , we will assume that the effects of underlying absorption are negligible .      in figure  [ figcap3]b",
    ", we overlay apertures on the pc h@xmath0  image of izw18 which outline the locations of elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratios ( note that these trapezoidal apertures are meant to guide the eye to areas with h@xmath0/h@xmath1  @xmath23 3.0 , and in some cases contain more than one of the apertures used to derive the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios ) .",
    "we detect dust in regions which are near uv - bright sources , as well as in regions which are far away from them . the high surface brightness h  ii  regions which have significant extinction",
    "are all located in the se component , in agreement with the ground based optical observations ( sk93 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is expected , since the se region contains younger stars and likely more dense molecular clouds than the nw region .",
    "the distribution of dust ( and therefore molecular gas ) suggests that future star formation is likely in the se region ; furthermore , the reddening morphology hints at the presence of a band of extinction between the se and nw components .",
    "this region can not be sampled for dust with the present h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio method , due to the absence of h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  emission in this region ( see   [ s3.2 ] ) .",
    "overall , we detect dust with a similar distribution to that found in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 5253 @xcite .",
    "the irregular nature of the dust distribution immediately implies one or both of the following scenarios .",
    "first , dust which is near uv - bright clusters is surviving in a very hard radiation field , implying an efficient mechanism of self - shielding on small scales and the prominence of clumpy structure in the ism .",
    "second , dust which is displaced from uv - bright clusters is consistent with dust production by a previous generation of star formation .    in order to estimate a mass of the dust which we detect ,",
    "we must make certain assumptions about the nature of the grains .",
    "one method with which to obtain a dust mass estimate is to use the ratio of intensities of far infrared ( fir ) emission at 60 and 100 @xmath24 m .",
    "however , izw18 is not detected by the iras satellite in either waveband .",
    "a second method with which to find the dust mass is to apply a detailed balance argument , assuming one knows the nature of the incident radiation field and the composition of the grains .",
    "however , especially in the case of bcd s such as izw18 where the nature of the underlying stellar population is not yet fully characterized , this detailed balance argument is also not applicable .",
    "a third and widely used method to obtain a dust mass is to apply a gas - to - dust ratio which is applicable to similar physical conditions ( metallicity , radiation field , star formation efficiency , etc . ) .",
    "seminal galactic work on this correlation by bohlin , savage , & drake ( 1978 ) finds that the mean ratio @xmath12(h  i  @xmath10 h@xmath5)/e(b - v)@xmath25 is nearly constant ( within a factor of 1.5 ) , with a value of 5.8@xmath210@xmath26 @xmath8 mag@xmath7 . from a larger stellar sample ,",
    "@xcite find a slightly lower value of 4.93@xmath210@xmath26 @xmath8 mag@xmath7 .",
    "extinction studies in other environments suggest a trend of increasing gas - to - dust ratio with decreasing ambient metallicity .",
    "extinction studies toward stars in the lmc arrive at an average value of @xmath12(n@xmath27)/e(b - v)@xmath25 = 2.4@xmath210@xmath28 @xmath8 mag@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the more metal - poor conditions of the smc yield yet higher values , perhaps as high as 10@xmath29 @xmath8 mag@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the h  i  synthesis imaging study of @xcite shows that there is a column density maximum of 3@xmath210@xmath26 @xmath8 which is coincident with the se component ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "if we assume that the se ionized component is embedded in an h  i  envelope , then we can make a very crude estimate of the ratio of h  i  column density to extinction by applying the relation @xmath30 where we have assumed r@xmath19 = a@xmath19/e(b - v ) = 3.1 , and that a representative value of the average extinction towards the se region is a@xmath19 = 0.2 mag .",
    "this value is comparable to , but less than , estimates of the gas - to - dust ratio in the smc ( 3.7 - 5.2@xmath210@xmath28 @xmath8 mag@xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it makes no correction for a potentially large contribution from molecular hydrogen ( necessary to sustain the high star formation rate ; see arguments below ) , which may allow the two results to be consistent .",
    "furthermore , this estimate only accounts for the fraction of the dust which may be foreground to izw18 ; if a substantial amount of dust is located behind or mixed within the h  ii  regions , this argument will ( perhaps significantly ) underestimate the total dust mass within the galaxy .",
    "next , we must assume a value for the dust - to - gas ratio by mass in order to obtain a dust mass estimate .",
    "we make such an assumption in two ways .",
    "first , we note that @xcite finds the average dust - to - gas ratio in the smc to be 8.2@xmath210@xmath31 by mass ( roughly 30 times less than in the galaxy ) .",
    "since this is the lowest - metallicity galaxy which has well studied extinction properties , we naively apply this ratio to izw18 .",
    "this represents an apparent upper limit , since there is evidence of a trend towards lower dust - to - gas ratios at lower metallicities , as previously mentioned , and the metallicity of izw18 is @xmath6 0.8 dex lower than that of the smc .",
    "applying such an assumption and equation  [ e3 ] , rewritten in the more convenient form @xmath32 we arrive at a dust mass of @xmath6 2000 m@xmath4  ( with no correction for the molecular gas content ) .",
    "the second method with which to estimate the dust - to - gas ratio is to apply the analytical relation found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lf98 ) , @xmath33 .",
    "while this relation was derived for dwarf irregulars and not bcd s , we include it for completeness , and because the application of the relation to the smc yields a dust - to - gas ratio of 6.5@xmath210@xmath31 by mass , in general agreement with the observational result of @xcite . applying the same relation to izw18",
    ", we obtain a dust - to - gas ratio of 1.7@xmath210@xmath34 by mass , which is consistent with the upper limit of 3.7@xmath210@xmath34 obtained by lf98 by assuming a 100 @xmath24 m flux for izw18 .",
    "we thus assume a value of 2@xmath210@xmath34 for the dust - to - gas ratio using this relation , but note its general uncertainty , and that it appears high in comparison to observational estimates from other low - metallicity systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "application of equation  [ e4 ] then yields a dust mass of @xmath6 4800 m@xmath4 .    from the above arguments",
    ", we estimate a total dust mass of ( 2 - 5)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4  within izw18 , due to the lack of further constraints which may be placed on the nature of the dust content from these observations .",
    "we note that this dust mass is lower than all of the bcd s which are detected in the iras bands in the study by lf98 , as expected for the very low metallicity of izw18 .",
    "we thus consider this a conservative estimate of the total dust content of this bcd .",
    "if the dust production process and evolution behaves as in the dwarf irregular sample ( e.g. , all dwarf irregulars with 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath12 7.4 have dust masses @xmath12 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 ; lf98 ) , then the above values may be too high .",
    "further constraints on the nature of the dust content of izw18 will be very useful .",
    "izw18 is undergoing an intense star formation episode , as evidenced by its blue photometric color ( u@xmath35b = -0.88 , b@xmath35v = -0.03 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its large number of ionizing , massive stars ( see table  [ t3 ] ) , and by the large ionized gas extent ( e.g. , figures  [ figcap1]a and [ figcap1]b ) .",
    "consequently , we expect concentrations of molecular gas throughout the galaxy , since we observe large h  ii  regions and ob associations .",
    "izw18 is not detected in co observations , nor is any galaxy with ambient metallicity below 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath6 8.0 @xcite .",
    "the potential reasons why detections of co in low - metallicity galaxies have remained elusive are numerous .",
    "one explanation is that the conversion factor , @xmath36 , from i@xmath37 to n@xmath38 becomes nonlinear below a certain metallicity @xcite . at low abundances , the column density of the co molecule will decrease . in areas undergoing massive star formation ,",
    "the hard uv radiation field will more easily photodissociate co to the point where it can no longer be self - shielding ; @xcite find observational evidence for such behavior .",
    "this will decrease the component of molecular clouds which will have prominent co emission , while the h@xmath5 is less affected .",
    "the filling factor decreases , reducing the co luminosity for a given molecular gas mass , and incompletely sampling the h@xmath5 mass as a result .    these large dust concentrations ( of order 50 - 100 pc , see figure  [ figcap3]b ) suggest that the process of h@xmath5 formation on grain surfaces may be ongoing in izw18 .",
    "recent fuse non - detections of h@xmath5 in absorption in izw18 @xcite can still be consistent with the presence of large amounts of molecular gas , since these hst results indicate that at least some of the dust is peripheral to the uv - bright clusters , and not necessarily along lines of sight to them .",
    "we interpret these results as evidence for a clumpy ism in izw18 ; small , dense molecular clouds will allow active star formation , while their volume filling factor and overall co luminosity will be very small .",
    "@xcite also conclude that dense , discrete clouds may have gone undetected in their fuse observations . clearly , very high - resolution observations ( i.e. , interferometric co mapping ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) of the ism of izw18 and of other low - metallicity galaxies are needed to attempt to locate the molecular gas .",
    "it is most intriguing that the two lowest - metallicity galaxies known , izw18 and sbs0335 - 052 ( 12+log(o / h ) = 7.33@xmath220.01 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both contain significant amounts of dust . as discussed above , in izw18 , some of the dust concentrations are displaced from ionized regions .",
    "similarly , in sbs0335 - 052 , dust is found displaced from the locations of the six massive star clusters @xcite . in both galaxies ,",
    "the presence of dust displaced from some of the ionizing clusters suggests that the molecular gas content of low - metallicity galaxies is very difficult to quantify via uv absorption or co tracer lines .",
    "in particular , these results suggest that the lack of molecular gas as inferred from such investigations does not necessarily imply a lack of molecular gas , but rather a different mechanism of shielding ( e.g. , small , dense molecular clouds ) when the metallicity is very low .",
    "new wfpc2 narrow band images of the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 have been analyzed .",
    "images at h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  are used to constrain the dust content and distribution of the galaxy , to analyze the morphology of the ionized gas , and to characterize individual h  ii  regions .",
    "we detect significantly elevated h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratios throughout the galaxy , both close to and displaced from uv sources , and in general agreement with the morphology derived by @xcite .",
    "the effects of collisional excitation and stellar absorption are shown to be minimal , and we interpret these ratios as indicative of the presence of dust .",
    "the small total dust mass , estimated to be of order 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 , is expected for the very low metallicity of the galaxy and is consistent with the iras non - detection in the far infrared regime .",
    "the presence of dust at low metallicities is now seen in the two lowest metallicity galaxies and is significant , since these may be the most ideal testbeds for studies of galaxy formation and chemical evolution processes at low redshifts .",
    "the presence of dust in izw18 allows us to form a consistent picture of the galaxy s interstellar medium as derived from various observational studies .",
    "izw18 is a low mass galaxy which is embedded in a large h  i  envelope @xcite . within this neutral gas ,",
    "we see in deep optical and infrared imaging ( ht95 ; demello et al .",
    "1998 ; aloisi et al . 1999",
    "; stlin 2000 ) the evolutionary signatures of stars down to the lower mass limit which is currently detectable ( @xmath6 1.1 m@xmath4  in nicmos imaging ; stlin 2000 ) .",
    "the large ionized regions and intense h@xmath0  emission evidence the uv flux of massive stars and suggest ongoing star formation . mixed throughout the galaxy",
    "we find large dust concentrations , which could be due to either ( or both ) mass loss from massive stars or intermediate mass ( agb ) stars that have been recently supported by the aforementioned cmd studies .",
    "regardless of its origin , however , the presence of dust suggests that areas rich in molecular gas are abundant even at this very low metallicity .",
    "the fuse non - detection of diffuse h@xmath5 in absorption @xcite may still be consistent with the presence of large amounts of molecular gas in izw18 , since in these observations we find bulk dust distributions displaced from uv clusters and not along lines of sight directly to them .",
    "we favor the scenario that the molecular clouds in izw18 ( and likely in other low - metallicity galaxies ) are small and dense .",
    "this will cause them to be very difficult to detect , yet still allow them to actively and efficiently form the short - lived massive stars which we see throughout izw18 .",

    "<S> we present new wfpc2 narrow band imaging of the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 , which is host to the lowest - metallicity h  ii  regions known . </S>",
    "<S> images at h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  are combined with archival broad band images to allow the study of the ionized gas distribution and morphology . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  flux ratio reveals significant enhancements in some areas of both the `` northwest '' and `` southeast '' regions of the galaxy , with ratios elevated to levels as high as 3.4 . the h@xmath0/h@xmath1  ratio varies considerably with position throughout the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> comparing this distribution with the stellar distribution indicates that the regions of enhanced h@xmath0/h@xmath1   ratio are not due to the effects of either collisional excitation or underlying stellar absorption , and therefore are most likely interpreted as the presence of dust . </S>",
    "<S> this dust has an estimated mass of ( 2 - 5)@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 , which is consistent with the iras far - ir non - detection . under the assumption that dust traces the presence of molecular gas </S>",
    "<S> , these results suggest that the molecular component of the ism of izw18 , which is needed to fuel its active star formation , is also very clumpy </S>",
    "<S> . such a distribution would be consistent with the recent fuse non - detections of diffuse h@xmath5 . </S>"
