    "the x - ray transient gro j1655 - 40 ( also called x - ray nova scorpii 1994 ) was discovered with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) on 1994 july 27 @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart was discovered soon after by @xcite .",
    "subsequent optical studies showed that the system is an lmxb composed of a blue subgiant ( spectral type f4 iv ) as the secondary and a black hole as the primary ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) @xcite , located at a distance of 3.2 kpc @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) established the orbital inclination of the system to be @xmath2 .",
    "galactic black hole binaries ( hereafter bhb ) show interesting luminosity / spectral properties which appears to be strongly related with the accretion behaviour onto the black hole ( hereafter bh ) .",
    "matter accretes onto the bh through an accretion disk , which has nearly keplerian orbits ; the last stable orbit is called `` innermost stable circular orbit '' ( i.e. isco ) @xcite which is located at @xmath3 ( for a schwarzschild bh ; where @xmath4 is the gravitational radius ) . note that not always the matter arrives at this radius ; this depends on the particular state .",
    "there are five states known in bhb : quiescent , low - hard , intermediate , high - soft and very high states in the unification scheme ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the inner radius of the accretion disk is thought to decrease from quiescence to vhs . at lower mass accretion rate ,",
    "corresponding to several percent of the eddington luminosity , a bhb usually enters the low - hard ( lh ) state and at very low accretion rates it reaches the quiescent state , which may be just an extreme of the lh state . in both of these states ,",
    "the spectrum of a bhb is dominated by a hard , nonthermal power - law component ( photon index @xmath5 ) ; it is most plausibly explained as due to comptonization of soft photons ( from a hot optically thick disk ) by a hot optically thin plasma .",
    "@xcite postulated that in these states the disk does not extend down to the isco , but is truncated at some larger radius and the interior volume is filled by a hot ( @xmath6 kev ) , radiative inefficient , advection - dominated accretion flow or adaf .",
    "the multicolor disk model ( mcd ) ( @xcite , which is an application of the @xcite disk ) is used to describe the thermal component that is dominant in the very high ( vh ) and high - soft ( hs ) states . in figure 4.1",
    "@xcite the unification model from @xcite is pictured , using both mcd and adaf models .",
    "it represents how the geometry of the accretion flow changes as the mass accretion rate from the donor star varies . when the accretion is low , the flow consists of two zones ( disk and adaf ) and for the two states in which the accretion is high , the disk extends down to the isco .",
    "in all five states the disk is bathed in a corona which resembles a continuation to the adaf .",
    "although this model had success in the explanation of evolution of the states , it has important limitations not discussed in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we briefly report on observations of the bhb gro j1655 - 40 made by integral . after describing the observations and our analysis techniques , we present the preliminary results of the spectral fits .",
    "we then briefly discuss the results and end with some concluding remarks .    ]",
    "the data were obtained with integral and cover the outburst using the instruments spi , ibis / isgri , jem - x and omc .",
    "these first part of the observations were made during 4 too ( of 100 ks each ) spread from 27 february to 11 april of 2005 .",
    "the dithering pattern used during the observations was @xmath7 .",
    "data analysis ( in the case of jem - x , ibis / isgri and spi ) was performed using the standard osa 5.1 analysis software package available from the integral science data centre ( hereafter isdc ) . in the case of spi , because of the lower angular resolution and crowdedness of the field of view ( fov ) in @xmath8-rays at this position of the sky ( @xmath9,@xmath10)=(@xmath11,@xmath12 ) , ( see figure [ mosaic ] ) , we used a non - standard procedure in the analysis of the data , described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , in the case of omc , we used a non - standard pipeline for extraction of fluxes ( a. domingo , private communication ) , which will be delivered under osa 6.0 in the very near future .",
    "the data we analized come from the observations with p.i .",
    ": miller . in the case of omc ,",
    "all the public data from isdc were downloaded ( this implies only a slight increase of data ) . in order to avoid large off - axis angles in the case of jem - x and because of its reduced fov ( @xmath13 of diameter )",
    ", we limited the radius of directions of pointings with respect to the gro j1655 - 40 position to be @xmath14 only . in the case of spi and isgri , with large fully coded fields of view ( fcfov )",
    "( @xmath15 for spi and @xmath16 for ibis ) this selection of pointings was not applied .",
    "summarizing , 199 individual pointings were used for spi and ibis / isgri , 96 pointings for jem - x and 66 pointings for omc .",
    "we ommit the spi results in the current paper , since the analysis is still in progress .",
    "figure [ curves ] shows the gro j1655 - 40 light curves obtained by ibis / isgri ( from the integral galactic bulge monitoring program ) in two energy bands ( 60 - 150 kev and 20 - 60 kev ) together with omc ( optical ) . the asm / rxte ( 2 - 10 kev ) light curve in the same period of time is shown in the same figure .",
    "a progressive delay in the outburst can be seen in the softer energy range with respect to high energies . in the optical the delay",
    "is @xmath17 days as noted for the same period of observations @xcite .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the time intervals ( one revolution each ) over which spectra were obtained .",
    "the optical / soft x - rays light curve behaved very differently from that of the hard x - rays ; this might suggest that the x - ray light curve is actually a composite of the two known spectral components , one gradually increasing with the optical / soft x - rays emission ( accretion disk ) and the other following the behaviour of the hard x - rays ( jet and/or corona ) .",
    "this is another point favouring the unification model explained before ( proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite propose that during this outburst a transition occurs from lh to hs state .",
    ".table with some information of interest of this very preliminar spectra fitting ( @xmath18 means the number of degrees of freedom of the spectral fitting ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ spect ]    ]    we performed spectral analysis of the jem - x and ibis / isgri data . for jem - x and isgri ,",
    "individual spectra were obtained for each scw .",
    "the spectra were then combined to obtain an averaged spectrum per revolution ( i.e. integral revolution 290 , 295 , 296 , 299 and 304 ) using the @xmath19 osa tool .",
    "this was done , since there was not a significant evolution of the spectra during a revolution and it improved the signal to noise .",
    "we then performed a simultaneous fit to the jem - x and ibis / isgri data , for each of the five revolutions using xspec v.12 .    in figure [ spec ]",
    "we show spectra from revolutions 290 , 295 and 299 because these are the most significant to see the evolution of the source during the total period of observations . in table",
    "[ spect ] we summarize some information obtained during these very preliminary fits . from this analysis , we observe a strong evolution of the spectrum from a pure hard power law , in revolution 290 , to a model constituted by a photo - absorbed accretion disk bathed in a comptonizing corona ( @xcite ) , in revolutions 295 and 296 .",
    "this is accompanied by a strong increase of the photon index ( from @xmath20 , in revolution 290 , to @xmath21 , in revolution 299 , the source is almost not detected by isgri in revolution 304 ) together with an increase of the input photon temperature ( from @xmath22 kev , in revolution 290 , to @xmath23 kev , in revolution 295 , and @xmath24 kev , in revolution 296 ) .",
    "all together would indicate an increasing of the input photon flux coming from the innermost regions of the accretion disk , which are scattered with the electrons present in the hot corona @xcite .",
    "these features are as expected in the case of successive approaching of the inner disk radius down to the isco , as predicted by the unified model from @xcite . in revolutions 299 and 304",
    "the photo - absorbed and comptonized disk model is also better than photo - absorbed disk alone , but a more complex spectrum ( which requires reflection and likely a weak iron line ) appears to be more appropiate .",
    "as we noted above , there was a transition from an lh state to an hs state @xcite .",
    "this can be explained in the common accepted view of black hole x - ray transients , in which the low - mass companion star undergoes roche - lobe overflow , but at a sufficiently low rate that the gas is accumulated in the ( cool ) disk until a critical level is reached , at which point the outburst occurs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in between outbursts ,",
    "the accretion rate is low and is conjectured that an adaf model region fills the inner accretion disk . with this scenario , in the quiescent and low states the accretion is low and",
    "the spectrum is hard as is shown in our spectrum from revolution 290 . during the outburst ,",
    "the spectrum changes to a @xmath25kev thermal spectrum , often interpreted as the radiation from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk , superposed on a softer power law ( photon indices @xmath26 ) extending to @xmath27 kev , as shown in our spectra from revolutions 295 and 296 .",
    "when the accretion disk becomes thick and very near to the isco , then the reflection features are manifested in the shape of the spectra ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as can be seen in our spectra from revolutions 299 and 304 . it is worth noticing that , when matter is close to the bh , jet production is an alternative mechanism for the origin of the hard x - rays .",
    "we can conclude that our spectra is consistent with major models for outburst evolution , including model of @xcite .",
