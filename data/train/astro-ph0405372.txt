    "the currently favored theory for the formation of the moon is the giant impactor theory formulated by hartmann @xmath2 davis ( 1975 ) and cameron @xmath2 ward ( 1976 ) .",
    "computer simulations show that a mars - sized giant impactor could have hit the earth on a zero - energy parabolic trajectory , ejecting impactor mantle debris that coalesced to form the moon .",
    "further studies of this theory include ( benz , slattery , @xmath2 cameron 1986 , 1987 ; benz , cameron , @xmath2 melosh 1989 ; cameron @xmath2 benz 1991 ; canup @xmath2 asphaug 2001 ; cameron 2001 , canup 2004 ; stevenson 1987 ) .",
    "we summarize evidence favoring this theory : ( 1 ) it explains the lack of a large iron core in the moon . by the late time that the impact had taken place ,",
    "the iron in the earth and the giant impactor had already sunk into their cores .",
    "so , when the mars - sized giant impactor hit the earth in a glancing blow , it expelled debris , poor in iron , primarily from mantle of the giant impactor which eventually coalesced to form the moon ( cf .",
    "canup 2004 , canup2004b ) .",
    "computer simulations ( assuming a zero - energy parabolic trajectory for the impactor ) show that iron in the core of the giant impactor melts and ends up deposited in the earth s core .",
    "( 2 ) it explains the low ( 3.3 grams/@xmath3 ) density of the moon relative to the earth ( 5.5 grams/@xmath3 ) , again due to the lack of iron in the moon .",
    "( 3 ) it explains why the earth and the moon have the same oxygen isotope abundance - the earth and the giant impactor came from the same radius in the solar nebula .",
    "meteorites originating from the parent bodies of mars and vesta , from different neighborhoods in the solar nebula have different oxygen isotope abundances .",
    "the impactor theory is able to explain the otherwise paradoxical similarity between the oxygen isotope abundance in the earth combined with the difference in iron .",
    "this is perhaps its most persuasive point .",
    "( 4 ) it explains , because it is due to a somewhat unusual event , why most planets ( like venus and mars , jupiter and saturn ) are singletons , without a large moon like the earth .",
    "competing ideas have not had comparable success .",
    "for example , the idea that the earth and the moon formed together as sister planets in the same neighborhood fails because it does nt explain the difference in iron . whereas the idea that the moon formed elsewhere in the solar nebula and was captured into an orbit around the earth fails because its oxygen isotope abundances would have to be different .",
    "that a rapidly spinning earth could have spun off the moon(from mantle material ) is not supported by energy and angular momentum considerations , it is argued .",
    "still , the giant attractor theory has some puzzling aspects .",
    "planets are supposed to grow from planetesimals by accretion .",
    "how did an object so large as mars , form in the solar nebula at exactly the same radial distance from the sun without having collided with the earth earlier , before it could have grown so large .",
    "indeed , such must have been the case during the formation of venus and mars for example .",
    "it s also hard to imagine an object as large as mars forming in an eccentric earth - crossing orbit",
    ". one might expect large objects forming in the solar nebula to naturally have nearly circular orbits in the ecliptic plane , like the earth and venus . besides",
    ", a mars - sized object in an eccentric orbit would not be expected to have identical oxygen abundances relative to the earth , and would collide with the earth on a hyperbolic trajectory not the parabolic trajectory that the successful computer simulations of the great impact theory have been using.(recent collision simulations by canup(2004 ) place an upper limit of 4 km / s for the impactor s velocity - at - infinity approaching the earth , setting an upper limit on its eccentricity of @xmath4 . ) the mars - sized object needs to form in a circular orbit of radius 1 au in the solar nebula but curiously must have avoided collision with the earth for long enough for its iron to have settled into its core .",
    "is there such a place to form this mars - sized object ?",
    "yes : the earth s lagrange point @xmath0(or@xmath1 ) which is at a radius of 1 au from the sun , with a circular orbit @xmath5 behind the earth(or @xmath5 ahead of the earth for @xmath1 ) .",
    "after the epoch of gaseous dissipation in the inner solar nebula has passed we are left with a thin disk of planetesimals interacting under gravity .",
    "the three - body problem shows us that the lagrange point @xmath0(or equivalently @xmath1 ) for the earth is stable for a body of negligible mass even though it is maximum in the effective potential .",
    "thus , planetesimals can be trapped near @xmath0 and as they are perturbed they will move in orbits that can remain near this location .",
    "this remains true as the earth grows by accretion of small planetesimals .",
    "therefore , over time , it might not be surprising to see a giant impactor growing up at @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) . in the discussion section",
    "we argue that there are difficulties in having the giant impactor come from a location different from @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) .",
    "examples of planetsimals remaining at lagrange points of other bodies include the well known trojan asteroids at jupiter s @xmath0 and @xmath1 points . as another example",
    ", asteroid 5261 eureka has been discovered at mars @xmath1 point .",
    "( there are five additional asteroids also thought to be mars trojans : 1998 @xmath6 , 1999 @xmath7 , 2001 @xmath8 , 2001 @xmath9 , 2001 @xmath10 . ) the saturn system has several examples of bodies existing at the equilateral lagrange points of several moons , which we discuss further in the `` note added '' after the discussion section .",
    "we propose that the mars - sized giant impactor can form as part of debris at earth s @xmath0 lagrange point .",
    "( it could equally well form at @xmath1 , but as the situation is symmetric , we will simply refer in the rest of the paper , unless otherwise indicated , to the object forming at @xmath0 ; the argument being the same in both cases ) . as the object forms and gains mass at @xmath0",
    ", we can demonstrate that its orbit about the sun remains stable .",
    "thus , it has a stable orbit about the sun , and remaining at @xmath0 keeps it from collision with the earth as it grows .",
    "furthermore , this orbit is at exactly the same radius in the solar nebula as the earth so that its oxygen isotope abundances should be identical .",
    "it is allowed to gradually grow and there is time for its iron to settle into its core , and the same also happens with the earth .",
    "the configuration is stable providing the mass of the earth and the mass of the giant impactor are both below .0385 of the mass of the sun , which is the case . but eventually , we numerically demonstrate that gravitational perturbations from other growing planetesimals can kick the giant impactor into a horseshoe orbit and finally into an orbit which is chaotically unstable in nature allowing escape from @xmath0 .",
    "the giant impactor can then enter an orbit about the sun which is at an approximate radial distance of 1 au , which will gradually creep toward the earth ; leading , with large probability , to a nearly zero - energy parabolic collision with the earth . once it has entered the chaotically unstable region about @xmath0 ,",
    "a collision with the earth is likely . we will discuss this phenomenon in detail in section 4 . for references on the formation of planetesimals and related issues ,",
    "see ( goldreich 1973 ; goldreich @xmath2 tremaine 1980 ; ida @xmath2 makino 1993 ; rafikov 2003 ; wetherill 1989 ) .",
    "we are considering instability of motion near @xmath0 due to encounters by planetesimals .",
    "( the instability of the jupiter s outer trojan asteroids due to the gravitational effects of jupiter over time studied in levinson , shoemaker e. m. @xmath2 shoemaker c. s. ( 1997 ) , is a different process . )",
    "horseshoe orbits connected with the earth exist .",
    "in fact , an asteroid with a 0.1 km diameter , 2002 @xmath11 , has recently been discovered in just such a horseshoe - type orbit which currently approaches the earth to within a distance of only 3.6 million km ( conners et al .",
    "horseshoe orbits about the sun of this type are also called earth co - orbiting trajectories , which are in 1:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "an interesting pair of objects in horseshoe orbits about saturn are discussed in the note after the discussion section .",
    "a theoretical study of the distribution of objects in co - orbital motion is given by morais @xmath2 morbidelli ( 2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we describe a special set of collision orbits with the earth which exist due to escape from @xmath0 due to planetesimal perturbations .",
    "the perturbations cause a gradual peculiar velocity increase of the mass forming at @xmath0 so that it eventually achieves a critical escape velocity to send it toward a parabolic earth collision approximately in the plane of motion of the earth about the sun .",
    "the region in velocity space where escape from @xmath0 occurs in this fashion is relatively narrow .",
    "this mechanism therefore involves a special set of @xmath0 ejection trajectories which creep towards collision with the earth . at the end of section 3 we will present a full simulation in three - dimensions of a collision of a mars - sized impactor with the earth assuming a thin planetesimal disk , using the general three - body problem , where planetesimal encounters with both the impactor and the earth are done in a random fashion .",
    "the appendix of this paper discusses the dynamics of the random planetesimal encounters .",
    "the paper has several main results :    we show that a stable orbit at @xmath0 exists where a mars - sized giant impactor could grow by accretion without colliding with the earth .",
    "we show that eventually perturbations by other planetesimals can cause the giant impactor to escape from @xmath0 and send it onto a horseshoe orbit and then onto a creeping chaotic trajectory with an appreciable probability of having a near parabolic collision with the earth . in the discussion section",
    "we argue how this scenario fits in extremely well with giant impactor theory and explains the identical oxygen isotope abundances of the earth and the moon .",
    "the solar system itself provides a testing ground for our model . as we have mentioned",
    "the trojan asteroids show that planetesimals can remain trapped at lagrange points , and in the `` note added '' we point out that the system of saturn s moons provide examples where the phenomenon we are discussing can be observed , supporting our model .",
    "finally both in the `` note added '' and in the appendix we discuss prospects for future work .",
    "the spirit of this paper is to suggest the intriguing possibility that the hypothesized mars - sized impactor could have originated at @xmath0(or@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is hoped that this lays the ground work for more detailed simulations and work in the future .",
    "let @xmath12 represent the sun , @xmath13 the earth , and @xmath14 a third mass particle .",
    "we will model the motion of @xmath14 with systems of differential equations for the restricted and general three - body problems .",
    "the first preliminary model , and key for this paper , is the planar circular restricted three - body problem which assumes the following : 1 .",
    "@xmath15 move in mutual keplerian circular orbits about their common center of mass which is placed at the origin of an inertial coordinate system @xmath16 .",
    "the mass of @xmath14 is zero .",

    "let @xmath23 be the constant frequency of circular motion of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the period of the motion .",
    "we consider a rotating coordinate system @xmath28 which rotates with the constant frequency @xmath23 as @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the @xmath29@xmath30",
    "coordinate system the positions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fixed . without loss of generality , we can set @xmath31 and place @xmath12 at @xmath32 and @xmath13 at @xmath33 .",
    "here we normalize the mass of @xmath24 to @xmath34 and @xmath25 to @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath14 are @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 distance of @xmath14 to @xmath41^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , and @xmath42 distance of @xmath14 to @xmath43^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , see figure [ figure : figurea ] . the right hand side of ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    "represents the sum of the radially directed centrifugal force @xmath44 and the sum @xmath45 of the gravitational forces due to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that the units of position , velocity and time are dimensionless . to obtain position in kilometers , the dimensionless position @xmath28",

    ", @xmath49 corresponds to 1 year .",
    "it is noted that ( [ eq:2 ] ) is invariant under the transformation , @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that solutions in the upper half - plane are symmetric to solutions in the lower - half plane with the direction of motion reversed .",
    "this implies , as noted in the introduction , that all the results we will obtain for @xmath0 are automatically true for @xmath1 , and thus @xmath0 need only be considered .    system ( [ eq:2 ] ) of differential equations has five equilibrium points at the well known lagrange points @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "the locations of the lagrange points for arbitrary @xmath56 are a function of @xmath35 .",
    "three of these points are collinear and lie on the @xmath29-axis , and the two that lie off of the @xmath29-axis are called equilateral points .",
    "we note that the labeling of the locations of the lagrange points varies throughout the literature .",
    "we are using the labeling consistent with that in szebehely ( 1967 ) , where in figure [ figure : figurea ] @xmath57 is interior to to @xmath25 and @xmath24 , and where @xmath0 lies above the x - axis .",
    "( note : this means @xmath0 is @xmath5 behind the earth . )    the three collinear lagrange points @xmath58 lying on the @xmath29-axis are unstable .",
    "this implies that a gravitational perturbation of @xmath14 at any of the collinear lagrange points will cause @xmath14 to move away from these points as time progresses since their solutions near any of these points are dominated by exponential terms with positive real eigenvalues ( conley 1969 ) .",
    "the two equilateral lagrange points are stable , so that if @xmath14 were place at these points and gravitationally perturbed a small amount , it will remain in motion near these points for all time .",
    "this stability result for @xmath59 is subtle and was a motivation for the development of the so called kolmogorov - arnold - moser(kam ) theorem on the stability of motion of quasi - periodic motion in general hamiltonian systems of differential equations ( arnold 1961 ; 1989 ; siegel @xmath2 moser 1971 ) .",
    "a variation of this theorem was applied to the stability problem of @xmath59 by deprit @xmath2 deprit - bartolom ( 1967 ) .",

    "we will be considering cases where @xmath70 is slightly less than 3 , @xmath73 , where the hill s region is then the entire plane .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath14 is free to move throughout the entire plane .    in the next section",
    "we will initially use the planar circular restricted three - body problem to obtain insight into the motion of @xmath14 near @xmath0 .",
    "ultimately we are interested in the general three - dimensional three - body problem with the mass points @xmath74 of respective masses @xmath18 .",

    "we note that the stability result by deprit @xmath2 deprit - bartolom ( 1967 ) provides conditions for stability of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath0 ; however , it does not necessarily provide conclusions on instability .",
    "it is proven more generally in siegel @xmath2 moser ( 1971 ) that in the three - body problem , if @xmath75 satisfies @xmath92 then the motion is unstable .",
    "this is not satisfied in our case since @xmath93 .",
    "however , if it is not satisfied it does not guarantee stability , and a deeper analysis is required such as kam theory . in this more general case a result like that of deprit @xmath2 deprit - bartolom ( 1967 ) is not available .",
    "we have verified in the general three - dimensional three - body problem defined by ( [ eq:5 ] ) with @xmath93 , and more generally in the three - dimensional model for the solar system that @xmath0 is stable for a numerical integration time span of 10 million years .",
    "the model of the solar system we used includes the nine planets and is modeled as an n - body problem with circular coplanar initial conditions using the current masses of the planets and radii of the planetary orbits .",
    "the integration time span of 10 million years is suitable for the purposes of our analysis .",
    "while we have shown via full solar system that @xmath0 is stable it might be argued that this stability could be perturbed by other planetesimals , and in fact it is exactly this process that we are investigating ( see appendix ) .",
    "we expect that gravitational perturbations from other planetesimals will , via a random walk process in peculiar velocity , cause the mars - sized impactor to eventually escape from @xmath0 .",

    "when @xmath105 reaches @xmath133 , @xmath14 is able to escape from the thin horseshoe - like region and fly by the earth as is seen in figure [ figure : v011 ] .",

    "we are interested in the likelihood of earth collision while in breakout motion just after the bifurcation .",
    "this represents breakout motion with minimal energy .",
    "this transitional breakout motion has two important properties : + 1 .",
    "@xmath14 moves in a thin annular region about the sun , + 2 .",
    "@xmath14 repeatably flys by the earth .",
    "+ these properties imply the following : since the annular region is thin , the earth fly - bys are in general close .",
    "the close earth fly - bys are approximately parabolic in nature , as we will demonstrate , and as @xmath14 flys by the earth its actual velocity vector is approximately tangent with the earth s orbit .",
    "this implies that @xmath14 gains a negligible velocity increase due to gravity assist as it flys by the earth as we will show .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath14 will continue to move in an earth - like orbit about the sun , and continue to cycle .",
    "this implies that as @xmath14 moves around the sun , it will densely fill the thin annular region it moves in .",
    "this means that it has a high likelihood of colliding with the earth .",
    "we will demonstrate that collision readily occurs in these creeping breakout orbits .",
    "in fact , the previous case where @xmath135 , which is the first breakout motion we computed , leads immediately to collision at @xmath136 ( or 220.3847 years ) . in our exposition",
    "below , we will use a slightly different value of @xmath105 which happens to achieve collision at an even earlier time .",

    "the minimum value of @xmath145 is for @xmath146 . multiplying the values of @xmath114 by 29.78 yields a range of velocity values generally between 180 meters / s and 1.2 km / s .",
    "note that the two directions corresponding to the maximal spikes in velocity seen in figure [ figure : scatteringdirections ] approximately lie near the sun and anti - sun directions . in this figure",
    "the sun is toward the lower right .",
    "note that the method , or algorithm , used above to estimate the critical velocities @xmath114 at @xmath0 leading to breakout motion , is similar in nature to the method of estimating transitional stability regions , called weak stability boundaries , between capture and escape about the moon described in belbruno ( 2004 ) .",
    "this capture region has important applications .",
    "it was used by one of us to find a new type of low energy route to the moon in 1990 where lunar capture is automatic ( belbruno @xmath2 miller 1990 ) .",

    "other methods could be used to study the bifurcation from horseshoe to breakout motion such as the computation of suitable surfaces of section to the trajectories in phase space , and then monitoring the iterates of intersecting trajectories on the section .",
    "this would give a more complete knowledge of the phase space near breakout motion , but this approach is not necessary for our purposes .",
    "the algorithm we have described accurately determines when bifurcation occurs .",
    "we have also performed an analysis to understand the relationship of the critical breakout velocities as a function of the mass of the earth @xmath25 .",
    "it is found that roughly @xmath147 as an example , we consider the two cases : @xmath148 . when @xmath149 , then for @xmath150 , we obtain @xmath151 , respectively , and for @xmath152 , we obtain @xmath153 , respectively .",

    "the time of collision with the surface of the earth is at @xmath162 , corresponding to 57.3247 years .",

    "however , as we will see in the following , close fly - bys will only yield negligible kepler energy increases with respect to the sun .",
    "so , although the trajectory may have a qualitative different appearance , it will still have approximately the same kepler energy before and after close fly - bys .",
    "the change in the trajectories for tiny changes in @xmath105 observed is typical for chaotic motion in general , and is a sign that a _ hyperbolic invariant set _",

    "distance from the sun , but shifting its angular position with respect to the sun .",
    "this is because as @xmath14 creeps further and further away from @xmath0 approximately on earth s orbit , it can gravitationally perturb the earth when it moves relatively near to the earth since its mass is now one tenth that of earth .",
    "analogous to the restricted problem , when @xmath105 gets close to the breakout value , the horseshoe region begins to close on itself in a symmetrical way with respect to the earth .",
    "however , since the earth has shifted its location , the symmetrical closing point is not on the @xmath29-axis as in figure [ figure : v009 ] for the restricted problem , but at another location , the earth s location , approximately 1au from the sun .",

    "our analysis has shown that it is most likely to occur soon after breakout , which for the trajectory @xmath112 was only 4.6 years .",
    "it has been found that after breakout has occurred @xmath14 generally makes very close flybys of the earth for up to approximately 500 years , and then the flyby distance becomes steadily larger .",
    "the repetitive flybys increase the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the trajectory making collision less likely as @xmath14 is no longer restricted to staying as close to 1au radial distance from the sun as it did immediately after breakout .",
    "also , @xmath14 will acquire larger deviations in the out of plane directions .",
    "soon after breakout , these effects are significantly less pronounced . in this sense , soon after breakout @xmath14 has a good chance to creep into an earth collision ; however , if it does not have one relatively soon then the flybys themselves will eventually make collision less likely .",
    "overall , as we have shown , the probability of collision with earth rather promptly after breakout is appreciable ( of order 1/4 ) . as discussed previously , running additional cases could establish this number to greater precision .",
    "we have shown that the giant impactor could have formed at @xmath0(@xmath1 ) and then escaped on a creeping chaotic trajectory to impact the earth , with a near parabolic encounter in agreement with simulations .      since the earth s orbit and venus are nearly circular and co - planar even at the current epoch , after 4.5 billion years of perturbations",
    ", this suggests that the early disk of planetesimals in the neighborhood of the earth was quite thin and that the planetesimals in the disk were in orbits that had low eccentricity ( e ) and inclination ( i ) , @xmath303 .",

    "if @xmath309 , then @xmath310 , and the planetesimals whose semi - major axes are within a distance of @xmath311 of the earth s distance from the sun of 1au will likely suffer collision with the earth within a short number of years since we expect the orbits to be chaotic , and the impact parameter with the earth is less than the critical impact parameter @xmath311 for collision with the earth .",
    "this will clear out a region of @xmath312 around 1au _ except for planetesimals in stable orbits around @xmath0(or@xmath1)_. planetesimals at nearly 1au from the sun  and not at @xmath0(or@xmath1)will quickly be accreted by the earth , before having the chance to grow large by accretion themselves .",
    "cowley ( lecture at univ . of michigan 2002 ) has noted this problem , saying that `` advocates of the big whack hypothesis usually say that the impactor must have been formed near the earth .",
    "this is neither probable nor impossible .",
    "it is not probable because the earth could have readily swept up materials that would have formed the other body .",
    "it is not impossible because we do not know the precise conditions of the accumulation of the earth , and can not say how improbable assembly of the putative impactor near one astronomical unit really was . '' ) the stable location at @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) answers the probability question , offering a reasonably likely scenario for forming the giant impactor near 1au without the material first being swept up by the earth .",
    "once this cleared out region of @xmath313 has been established , there will be no further quick accretion onto the earth , because the planetesimal s orbits will not take them to within an impact distance @xmath311 from the earth . then they will have to diffuse in by two - body relaxation - from perturbations by other planetesimals and planets .",
    "this two - body relaxation process will slowly put planetesimals into the gap region again and there will be be quick accretion from the gap .",
    "the giant impactor is expected to be one of the later impactors to hit the earth because the successful simulations of the formation of the moon start with the earth already at nearly its current mass , showing that its subsequent accretion ( after the giant impactor hit ) is assumed to be small ( canup @xmath2 asphaug 2001 ) .",
    "the giant impactor should also be expected to be one of the latter impacts because planetesimals , including the earth , grow by accretion with time and that would have also allowed more time for the giant impactor to have grown by accretion itself .",
    "if the giant impactor is one of the _ latter _ impactors as argued by canup @xmath2 asphaug ( 2001 ) ( after most accretion for the earth has been completed ) then if it is not from @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) it must originally come from _ either _ significantly outside 1au or significantly inside 1au .",
    "but then it would violate one of the key advantages of the great impactor theory : namely , point ( 3 ) in the introduction , which explains why the earth and moon have the same oxygen isotope abundance- namely that the earth and the giant impactor came from the same radius in the solar nebula .",
    "meteorites from different neighborhoods in the solar nebula(those associated with parent bodies of mars and vesta for example ) have different oxygen isotope abundances .",
    "the impactor theory is able to explain the otherwise paradoxical similarity between the oxygen isotope abundance in the earth and the moon combined with the difference in iron .",
    "the earth has oxygen isotope abundances that are an average over all the planetesimals it has accreted  some initially from inside 1au and some from outside .",
    "a giant impactor forming outside 1au and drawn in by two - body interactions would have oxygen isotope abundances intermediate between earth and mars and therefore not identical with the earth .",
    "standard giant impact theory has the moon formed primarily out of mantle material from the giant impactor material ( see ( canup 2004 ) ) .",
    "the rest of the material in the giant impactor is absorbed by the earth and the iron core of the giant impactor eventually finds its way into the earth s core , leaving the moon iron depleted relative to the earth . the moon has been found to have a small core and this is assumed to be from giant impactor material .",
    "( see ( wnke 1999 ) for a discussion of how the giant impactor theory can accommodate this . )",
    "if the moon derives from giant impactor material then it would have , the theory proposes , isotopic abundances identical with the earth if it was formed near 1au and this is observed to be the case ( clayton @xmath2 mayeda 1996 ; wiechert et al 2001 ; wnke 1999 ; lodders @xmath2 fegley 1997 .",
    "but if the giant impactor came from significantly outside outside 1au its isotopic abundances would be significantly different from that of proto - earth . furthermore , since @xmath314 is only 10@xmath315 the mass of the earth , this would pollute the proto - earth s isotopic abundances with only a 10@xmath315 contribution from the giant impactor .",
    "this would give the earth and the moon different isotopic abundances , if the giant impactor came from significantly outside 1au .",
    "a similar trouble occurs if the giant impactor originated significantly inside 1au , if the oxygen isotope abundances inside 1au are heterogeneous as well .",
    "( at present we have no meteorites in our possession whose parent bodies are thought to be mercury or venus .",
    "so we currently have no data for oxygen abundances inside 1au . )    on the other hand , consider what happens if the giant impactor originated at @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is in a stable orbit , so it is not immediately accreted onto the earth , and can grow large and hit the earth later , alleviating the problem mentioned by cowley .",
    "it sits nicely at 1au and accretes exactly the same type of material the earth does , some diffusing from outside 1au , and some from inside .",
    "the integral of the oxygen isotope abundances of the accretion should be identical with that of the earth .",
    "eventually , perturbations kick the giant impactor out of its stable orbit and it collides quickly with the earth . when the giant impactor hits the earth and kicks out the moon , since the earth and giant impactor have identical isotope ratios , the earth and moon should have identical isotope abundances even though the earth and moon are polluted to different extents by giant impactor material .",
    "this is an advantage to the giant impactor model , producing automatic agreement with proposition ( 3 ) of the giant impactor model .",
    "since this is one of the latter accretion events for the earth in terms of the accumulation of its mass , the oxygen isotope abundances for the earth and moon will not be further significantly changed by post - giant impactor accretion .",
    "debris remains at @xmath0 ( as the trojan asteroids prove ) . from this debris",
    "a giant impactor starts to grow like the earth through accretion as described above .",
    "as the forming giant impactor reaches a sufficient mass ( @xmath316 ) , it gradually moves away from @xmath0 through gravitational encounters with other remaining planetesimals and it randomly walks in peculiar velocity .",
    "it gradually moves farther and farther from @xmath0 approximately on the earth s orbit in a horseshoe orbit at 1au , until it acquires a peculiar velocity of approximately 180 m / s .",
    "the giant impactor then performs breakout motion where it performs a number of cycles about the sun , repeatably passing near to the earth . in a time span",
    "roughly on the order of 100 years it collides with the earth on a near parabolic orbit .",
    "we present here a mechanism for the origin of a mars - sized earth impactor and describe the path it would take to arrive at earth collision via a special class of slowly moving chaotic collision trajectories .",
    "the analysis shows that earth collision along these trajectories is likely .",
    "approaches for further work are discussed in the appendix .",
    "as we have discussed , the giant impactor could have grown up in a stable orbit at earth s @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) point where a stable orbit is possible and an object could remain and be able to grow by accretion without hitting the earth early - on .",
    "we expect this phenomenon could occur when there was a thin disk of planetesimals ( in nearly circular orbits ) .",
    "we have noted that saturn s rings are an example of such a thin disk of planetesimals(in this case , chunks of ice plus some dirt ) observable today .",
    "saturn s regular icy moons ( inside the orbit of titan ) are all in nearly circular orbits of low eccentricity suggesting that they formed out of a thin disk of planetsimals(ice chunks ) rather like saturn s rings today only larger in extent .",
    "in such a situation we might expect our scenario to operate .",
    "therefore it is quite interesting that we can find examples of objects at @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) , or escaping from @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) in the saturn system .",
    "saturn s moon helene co - orbits at the @xmath1 point ( 60@xmath317 ahead ) of the larger moon dione .",
    "helene has a largest diameter of 36 km and dione has a diameter of 1120 km .",
    "saturn s moons telesto ( diameter 34 km ) and calypso ( diameter 34 km ) occupy both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points relative to saturn s moon tethys ( diameter 1060 km ) .",
    "we would say that helene , telesto and calypso originated in a planetesimal disk(of ice chunks ) at these stable lagrange points and have grown in place there surviving till the present without colliding with dione or tethys .",
    "the rest of the planetesimals(ice chunks ) have accreted onto the regular moons of saturn.(saturn s rings themselves lie inside the roche limit where the formation of large objects is forbidden by accretion . ) while these lagrange moons are small relative to the primary , growth of larger objects with respect to the primary is also possible .",
    "saturn s moons epimetheus ( 119 km diameter ) and janus ( 179 km diameter ) co - orbit in horseshoe orbits just like the one we found for the giant impactor near breakout ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we would say that epimetheus formed at a lagrange point of janus and grew along with it by accretion from the planetesimal disk .",
    "later perturbations by other planetesimals kicked it out into a horseshoe orbit just short of breakout .",
    "thus , an object ( epimetheus ) nearly as large as the primary ( in this case janus ) can form and end up in a horseshoe orbit . just a little more perturbation and epimetheus would achieve breakout and likely collide with janus .",
    "these provide examples of the phenomena described in this paper that can be observed today .",
    "a similar pair of co - orbiting objects in horseshoe orbits in another solar system could be easily detected using stellar radial velocity data .",
    "this would appear to be a planet in circular orbit about the star whose mass was observed to mysteriously vary .",
    "the mass variation would be approximately sinusoidally in time with a period significantly longer than the orbital period of the primary .",
    "for example , if the secondary had a mass 0.1 times that of the primary ( like the giant impactor ) then this would show up as a nearly sinusoidal variation of 10@xmath315 in the deduced mass of the primary .",
    "if the two were nearly equal in mass there would be a 100@xmath315 variation in the mass .",
    "( when they were near each other at one end of the horseshoe orbit the effective mass perturbing the star would be nearly doubled , and when they circulated to be on opposite sides of the star their perturbation would temporarily vanish . ) we should have a look among the known cases of extra - solar planets for such cases .",
    "granted , we are currently able to see only gas giant planets(which may have even migrated inward ) rather the terrestrial ones we are considering , but still it would be interesting to look .",
    "if one found such a case , it would be easy to prove .    also of particular interest",
    "is the earth co - orbiting asteroid 2002 @xmath11 which is in a horseshoe orbit relative to the earth .",
    "of course , in addition to the giant impactor there can be other lagrange - point debris particularly at the other stable lagrange point not occupied by the giant impactor .",
    "this material may have been kicked out early - on by other planetesimals or by the giant impactor itself as it escaped into a horseshoe orbit .",
    "does any of this material survive to the present day ?",
    "2002 @xmath11 ( diameter @xmath318 0.1 km ) is in a horseshoe orbit at 1au , virtually identical to the horseshoe orbits found by us in figure 5 .",
    "this asteroid approaches the earth closely ( 3.6 million miles away ) once every 95 years while circling the sun at 1au .",
    "it was near one of these close approaches that it was discovered in 2002 .",
    "after a number of cycles , it is briefly captured for a period of 50 years as a quasi - satellite of the earth , before returning to the 95-year horseshoe orbit cycle .",
    "its rather large inclination ( 10.7@xmath317 ) saves it from collision with the earth .",
    "this object may have originated near @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) , and have been kicked out into a horseshoe orbit ( perhaps by the giant impactor itself ) . if that is so , it could be composed of the same material that also formed the seeds for the earth and the giant impactor .",
    "a sample return from this asteroid thus offers the possibility of obtaining some primordial material from the same reservoir that produced the earth and the moon . in this case",
    ", it should have oxygen isotope abundances similar to those found for the earth and the moon and an iron abundance similar to that of the earth .",
    "the final oxygen isotope abundances and iron abundances of the earth reflect not only their seed material ( originally from 1au ) but also the integral of the abundances accreted later , from material originally inside and outside 1au .",
    "thus , any slight differences in oxygen isotope abundances would be helpful in illuminating the accretion process .",
    "it would of course be very interesting to measure the age of a 2002 @xmath11 sample .",
    "on the other hand , if the sample has oxygen isotope abundances identical with the earth and the moon , but is poor in iron like the moon , that would suggest it was part of the splash material kicked out by the giant impactor at near escape velocity which did not coalesce onto the moon but rather ended circling the sun at 1au and then became trapped at @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) where it moved for perhaps a considerable time before finally being kicked out .",
    "if the sample has completely different oxygen isotope abundances from those of the earth and moon , that would indicate an origin elsewhere in the solar nebula ( not at 1au ) and we would then have to explain how it somehow got perturbed into a low eccentricity horseshoe orbit at 1au .",
    "( most earth - crossing asteroids perturbed into their current orbits from the main belt should have much larger eccentricities according to ipatov and mather 2002 . )",
    "bottke , et al ( 1996 ) have previously suggested that low eccentricity objects near 1au could have an origin tracing back to the earth - moon system , and radar results suggest ( ostro , et al 2003 ) that 2002 @xmath11 has a high albedo which supports this hypothesis ( according to connors et al 2004 ) .",
    "a sample return from asteroid 2002 @xmath11 is thus of particular scientific interest and may provide important clues as to the origin of the earth and the giant impactor that formed the moon .",

    "this gives enough time for the earth and the giant impactor to form and for their iron cores to sink into their centers ( in agreement with the estimate of 10 - 30 million years for core formation from the radioactive halfnium - tungsten chronometer ( see discussion in canup ( 2004 ) ) .",

    "the moon may be expected not to gain appreciable additional material .",
    "still smaller planetesimals , which make an insignificant contribution to the total remaining disk mass , may fall on the earth and moon - creating impact sites like mare imprium without adding significantly to the mass .",
    "since our scenario depends on the fact that there will be some debris left in earth s neighborhood at the time of the formation of the moon by the giant impactor , it is a plus that the moon shows some signs of late impacts itself .    the parameters here can be considered as a toy model at best .",

    "dynamical friction could slow breakout by slowing the accumulation of peculiar velocity of a massive body , but since @xmath0 is at a peak of the effective potential dynamical friction might even speed breakout .",
    "we have also ignored the effects of momentum transfer perpendicular to the plane in planetesimals that actually hit the giant impactor(considering only the momentum transfer in the more frequent distant encounters ) , because the latter is difficult to calculate .",
    "we have considered peculiar and parallel velocities as if they occurred in a slab ignoring the keplerian motion around the sun .",
    "we need not be married to these particular parameters , as they just form a jumping off point .",
    "they give us a guess as to the ratio of perpendicular velocities to velocities in the plane that might be acquired by gravitational perturbations in a random walk scenario .",
    "the random walk scenario is one that should occur under very general circumstances .",
    "other model parameters and assumptions might lead to varying scenarios , but those we have shown are a starting point for discussion",
    ". a natural continuation would be n - body experiments .",
    "more complicated mass distributions and various eccentricity models for the planetesimals could be considered .",
    "there is a lot of parameter space to be explored .",
    "more elaborate simulations with millions of particles including treatment of physical collisions could simulate the formation of the earth and the giant impactor and their growth in a cold disk scenario .",
    "after gaseous dissipation was finished and only planetesimals were left , we expect some debris to remain at @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( like the trojan asteroids ) because planetesimals either in , or perturbed , stable orbits about about @xmath0 and @xmath1 would stay there",
    ". a large object like a giant impactor can grow by accretion at @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is a matter of survival : an object in a stable orbit at @xmath0(or @xmath1 ) will survive  not hitting the earth  and by surviving can have more time to accrete other planetesimals and grow large itself .",
    "one could see how often the second largest object growing near 1au in fact started in the lagrange point debris of the earth . and",
    "finally , in the cases where a giant impactor of the type required to form the moon did indeed hit the earth causing formation of a moon like ours , one could see how often that impactor did in fact originate in lagrange point debris .",
    "in other words , what is the probability that the giant impactor originated at @xmath59 _ given _ that a moon like ours(with material of identical oxygen abundance from 1au ) is formed by collision ?",
    "there are several races going on .",
    "the earth starts forming by accretion and as it grows in mass , a stable lagrange point at @xmath0(and @xmath1 ) forms .",
    "as we have shown , as the earth grows , the region of stable orbits around @xmath0 grows in size , so a planetesimal trapped there in a stable orbit would stay there as a proto - earth grew .",
    "it would grow larger itself by surviving and accreting other planetesimals .",
    "it must grow to a mass of order @xmath484 , by the time it is perturbed out of its stable orbit and achieves breakout .",
    "breakout must be achieved before all the remaining planetesimals have accreted onto the earth . after breakout ,",
    "a collision with earth on a near parabolic trajectory is likely .",
    "our paper points out the possibility that the giant impactor that formed the moon could have originated at @xmath0 , survived there long enough to grow large by accretion , and eventually been perturbed by other planetesimals onto a collision course with the earth .",
    "awaiting numerical simulations capable of showing this occurring in detail , we have used examples within our own solar system to support our model ( see note added ) ."
