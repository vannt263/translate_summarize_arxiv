    "block copolymers ( bcp ) are a particular class of polymeric systems whose chain design is tightly connected with their functionality and applications .",
    "the bcp chains are composed of two or more chemically - distinct blocks that are covalently tethered together .",
    "these systems spontaneously self - assemble into exquisitely ordered nano - structures with characteristic length scale in the range of a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers  @xcite .",
    "for example , well - studied di - bcp melts produce a rich variety of three - dimensional morphologies including lamellae , hexagonally close - packed cylinders , bcc packing of spheres , and gyroid networks  @xcite .",
    "the wealth of these micro - phases continues to be intensely investigated by exploring chain architecture and chemical composition  @xcite , or confining bcp films in finite geometries  @xcite .",
    "much advance has been done in recent decades on understanding the micro - phases of bcp in bulk and in film geometries .",
    "however , technology transfer into patterning applications crucially relies on controlling of structure and local alignment  @xcite .",
    "such patterning technology might replace photolithography techniques in microelectronics , magnetic storage , solar cells and novel optical devices  @xcite .",
    "many techniques have been developed to attain such structural control , including chemical patterning of the substrate  @xcite , graphoepitaxy  @xcite , nanoimprint lithography  @xcite , and solvent annealing  @xcite .",
    "the orientation of anisotropic phases ( lamellae , cylinders ) and their lateral ( inplane ) ordering are two key factors in achieving structural control of bcp thin films  @xcite .",
    "a perpendicular orientation with respect to the underlying substrate of bcp lamellae or cylinders is usually desirable for many materials and engineering applications  @xcite .",
    "it has been implemented successfully by varying the bcp  @xcite and substrate characteristics  @xcite . however , full control of the lateral ordering in industrial processes is still an ever - challenging issue . in particular ,",
    "an unsolved problem is how to produce large defect - free arrays of bcp films in an economical and viable fashion , as is required in technological applications  @xcite .",
    "experimental techniques to orient lamellae in a perpendicular direction with respect to the substrate are well established .",
    "however , it is harder to control the film inplane ordering . in order to produce a defect - free and perfect inplane alignment , some experimental groups used corrugated substrates with a sinusoidal  @xcite , square - waved  @xcite , or saw - toothed  @xcite height variation .",
    "for example , park et al  @xcite investigated the self - assembly of bcp thin film on square - waved substrate .",
    "they reported that when the lamellar bcp film thickness is smaller than the corrugation amplitude , the inplane alignment was found to be perpendicular to the long axis of the substrate trenches , and exhibit almost perfect ordering with no inplane defects .",
    "on the other hand , for thicker films , the substrate topography effect is weaker , resulting in a lost of the perfect inplane alignment and quite a number of defects .",
    "we note that in a recent and related ( though preliminary ) study  @xcite , improved alignment of thicker lamellar forming bcp films was reported for blends of two di - bcps having different block sizes .",
    "it seems from the above - mentioned experimental studies  @xcite that , at present , there is only partial success in aligning defect - free lamellar forming bcp films as induced by substrate corrugation . on the theoretical side  @xcite ,",
    "previous works have been mainly devoted to study the transition between parallel to perpendicular lamellar phases in presence of a substrate .",
    "most of these studies have been done in two dimensions and can not address the important experimental issues related to inplane alignment , which intrinsically requires a 3d study .    in the present work ,",
    "we address in detail how substrate corrugation induces inplane alignment of 3d bcp films .",
    "our findings suggest that perfect inplane alignment is achieved as a synergy of geometrical effects of uni - directional substrate trenches , together with a weak preference of the substrate towards one of the bcp components .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section , we present the details of our model , and explain how the bcp structure is obtained for corrugated substrates using self - consistent field theory ( scft ) . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results , and in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the surface - induced alignment and its relation to current and future experiments .",
    "we also present in sec .",
    "iv our conclusions and some future prospects .",
    "our simulation setup is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "the simulations are performed in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) box of size @xmath0 .",
    "the technical details of using masking method to treat the boundaries can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the top surface is taken as a flat interface in order to mimic the bcp surface with air , while the bottom surface is sinusoidally corrugated along the @xmath1-direction and translationally invariant along the @xmath2-direction . the substrate height function",
    "is then written as @xmath3 and describes periodic surface trenches having a single @xmath4-mode along the @xmath1-direction with wavenumber @xmath5 , periodicity @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "the average thickness of the bcp film , @xmath8 , is averaged over the corrugation of the substrate ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "although the present study is restricted to simple sinusoidal corrugations , our simulations can equally be applied to other types of surface corrugation such as saw - toothed , square - wave , etc .",
    "self - consistent field theory ( scft ) is used to investigate the lamellar phase of a / b di - bcp , with a natural periodicity in our thin film geometry , @xmath9 .",
    "the 3d bcp film is confined between a flat top surface and a corrugated bottom one as defined in eq .",
    "( [ corrugate ] ) .",
    "we consider a melt of @xmath10 chains , each composed of @xmath11 monomers .",
    "the a - component molar fraction is @xmath12 and that of the b - component is @xmath13 .",
    "hereafter , we concentrate on symmetric di - bcp , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "all lengths are rescaled with the chain radius of gyration , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the kuhn length taken for simplicity to be the same for the two blocks .",
    "the flory - huggins parameter between the a and b monomers ( in units of @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the relative interaction between the substrate and the a / b components , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the interaction parameter between the substrate and the a ( b ) component .",
    "this choice means that a positive @xmath22 induces substrate preference of the a component .",
    "a detailed formulation of the numerical procedure ( pseudo - spectral method with fftw ) and its implementation to scft modelling of bcp systems can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the scft formulation gives the local density for the a and b components , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "there are two orientations of the bcp film with respect to the substrate , and they are shown schematically in fig .  2 .",
    "the parallel orientation is denoted @xmath25 and is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , while the perpendicular one is denoted as l@xmath26 .",
    "the l@xmath26 phase can be further divided into two orientations , l@xmath27 and l@xmath28 , which are orthogonal to each other as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "whereas l@xmath27 is orthogonal to the trench long - axis , the l@xmath28 ordering is parallel to the trenches .",
    "the bcp films in our study are in contact with a uni - axial corrugated substrate that has a small preference toward one of the two bcp components . in the next section",
    "we will show under what conditions it is possible to obtain a defect - free l@xmath26 phase .",
    "the structure of the bcp film is obtained via the scft method applied to the weak segregation , @xmath29 . for this @xmath30 value ,",
    "the bcp natural periodicity in our thin film geometry is @xmath31 ( in units of @xmath32 ) .",
    "we performed simulations at this temperature ( close to odt ) because the mobility of bcp chains is enhanced and it is much easier to anneal away the inplane defects .",
    "the bcp film of thickness @xmath33 is simulated inside a 3d box of cross - section @xmath34 , and of height @xmath35 . figure  3 shows the thermal equilibrated state of a bcp film that is casted on neutral substrate , @xmath36 . in ( a )",
    ", the substrate is flat ( @xmath37 ) , while in ( b)-(e ) the substrate is corrugated with @xmath38 , and has a decreasing periodicity : @xmath39 in ( b ) , @xmath40 in ( c ) , @xmath41 in ( d ) , and @xmath42 in ( e ) . for neutral substrates that are either flat or corrugated",
    ", the bcp film forms a l@xmath26 phase , but has many defects with no inplane alignment .",
    "for the same neutral and corrugated substrate , we repeated the simulations with different choices of random initial conditions .",
    "convergence is always obtained to a l@xmath26 phase with a multitude of defects .",
    "as the initial conditions are changed , defects are always found inside the bcp film , but at different and randomly distributed positions .    in fig .  4 , we repeat the same simulations as in fig .  3 , but with a small added substrate preference , @xmath43 ( in units of @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that @xmath45 is chosen to be small enough so that it does not induce the @xmath25 phase  @xcite . for the flat substrate in fig .",
    "4(a ) and the corrugated substrate with large periodicity of @xmath46 in 4(b ) , we obtain an l@xmath26 phase with many inplane defects .",
    "as the corrugation periodicity decreases ( while keeping @xmath22 and @xmath7 constant ) , a defect - free l@xmath27 is found in 4(c)-4(e ) , where @xmath47 varies between @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "two conclusive remarks , supported by fig .  4 , can be made at this stage .",
    "( i ) in order to get a perfect ( defect - free ) l@xmath26 phase , the substrate corrugation periodicity should lie in the range of @xmath50 when the other set - up parameters are : @xmath43 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "( ii ) the stability of the defect - free l@xmath26 crucially depends on a moderate surface preference , parameterized by a small @xmath22 value of the corrugated substrate",
    ".    the defect - free l@xmath26 phase can be reproduced in an entire range of the corrugation amplitude , @xmath7 , and periodicity , @xmath47 , as long as the substrate exhibits a small preference towards one of the bcp components and its corrugation is unidirectional .",
    "an example of a perfectly aligned l@xmath27 is shown in fig .  5 for @xmath53 and @xmath43 .",
    "further checks showing similar behavior were also performed for @xmath54 without presenting them here explicitly . the l@xmath26 phase shown in fig .",
    "5 is defect - free for the same range in corrugation amplitude , varying between @xmath55 in 2(a ) to 0.45 in 2(c ) .    from the presented results ,",
    "a prediction with experimental consequences emerges .",
    "it suggests that the perfect l@xmath26 alignment is induced by the substrate roughness , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , but is not sensitive to the specific value of @xmath7",
    ". the defect - free l@xmath26 structure can be reproducible and was repeatedly obtained for several different random initial conditions of the bcp film , always in contact with the same corrugated substrate .                  in order to understand why we obtain defect - free l@xmath26 phases , the relative stability of lamellar phases with the three orthogonal orientations ( @xmath25 , l@xmath27 and l@xmath28 ) is studied by comparing their free energies .",
    "the effect of surface preference is addressed more quantitatively in fig .  6 , where the transition between l@xmath26 and @xmath25 is shown in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "we use larger @xmath22 values ( between 3.0 and 4.2 ) in order to compare the present 3d study ( red line ) with the previous two - dimensional ( 2d)(dashed black line ) study of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the bcp was taken in the strong segregation regime , @xmath59 . as can be seen in fig .  6",
    ", the region of stable l@xmath26 is quite extended , while the stabilization of the @xmath25 phase requires large @xmath22 values .",
    "for the weaker segregation regime , such as @xmath29 that is used in most of the present study , the stability of the l@xmath26 is even further enhanced .",
    "note that in 2d there is only one perpendicular phase to the substrate , while in 3d there are two perpendicular orientations : the l@xmath27 phase that is orthogonal to the trenches , and the l@xmath28 whose orientation is parallel to the trenches ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "with infinite trenches in the @xmath2-direction , the latter l@xmath60 phase in 3d resembles the l@xmath26 phase in 2d .",
    "as will be shown below , the l@xmath27 is more stable than l@xmath28 , resulting in a larger region in fig .",
    "6 occupied by the stable 3d perpendicular phase in the phase diagram , as compared with the 2d case .    in fig .  7",
    ", we show the relative stability of the two perpendicular orientations , l@xmath27 and l@xmath28 , for a fixed and relatively small value of the substrate preference , @xmath43 .",
    "the free - energy difference per unit volume , @xmath61 ( in units of @xmath44 ) , is plotted as function of the periodicity ratio , @xmath62 in ( a ) and as function of the substrate amplitude @xmath7 in ( b ) .",
    "since we are in the weak segregation regime ( @xmath29 ) , the free - energy difference between the two orientations is small , of order 10@xmath63 ( in units of @xmath44 per unit volume ) .",
    "as @xmath64 is positive for the entire range of parameters , the l@xmath27 phase ( i.e. , perpendicular to the trenches ) is the most stable one . in the limit of @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", the corrugated substrate approaches a flat one and @xmath64 becomes vanishingly small .        as the substrate preference",
    "is found to play an important role in stabilizing the l@xmath27 phase , we explore in fig .",
    "8 the role of the preference field @xmath22 on the free - energy difference , @xmath64 , for a fixed @xmath53 and @xmath67 . as can be seen in fig .  8 , @xmath64 increases with @xmath22 making l@xmath27 more stable as compared to l@xmath28 .",
    "so far , the corrugated substrate was characterized by a single uni - directional sinusoidal mode for the entire simulation box . in order to model the experimental situation",
    "where substrates have an entire distribution of @xmath4-modes , we present in fig .",
    "9 an example of a bcp film in contact with a multi - mode corrugated substrate .",
    "as our simulation box has the size of about eight lamellar periodicities , @xmath68 , we can not simulate a real multi - mode random substrate .",
    "instead , we use a substrate composed of four sections , each with a different periodicity between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "an important point to consider is that the substrate uni - directionality is strictly observed , as well as the weak value of its preference parameter , @xmath71 . keeping these points in mind , fig .",
    "9 indeed shows that the bcp alignment is not sensitive to such a choice of a multi - mode substrate .",
    "the obtained bcp phase is still a defect - free l@xmath27 .",
    "in this paper we proposed a direct self - assembly scheme to obtain defect - free perpendicular bcp lamellar phases by manipulating both the geometrical roughness and chemical preference of the underlying corrugated substrate .",
    "our results suggest that there is an enhanced synergy between these two important substrate properties , as long as we maintain uni - directional substrate corrugations and a small surface preference",
    ". however , the two surface perturbations can not be too large .",
    "if a large chemical preference is introduced , it will destabilize the l@xmath26 phase ( and stabilize the parallel phase , @xmath25 ) .",
    "similarly , a large @xmath72 values will cause pronounced deformations of the l@xmath26 , with potential defects close to the corrugated substrate  @xcite .    in terms of the defect - free l@xmath26 phase ,",
    "our results are robust as can be seen in figs .  3 - 5 .",
    "changes in the periodicity @xmath47 and amplitude @xmath7 of the substrate corrugation do not affect the alignment , as long as the uni - directional corrugation is moderate and the substrate preference parameter is small .",
    "furthermore , the defect - free l@xmath26 phase is obtained even for multi - mode corrugated substrates as shown in fig .",
    "another reason for the claimed robustness is that the defect - free l@xmath26 phase is obtained for different choices of the random initial condition of the film structure , mimicking a film preparation above the odt or a disordered bcp solution that is spin - casted onto the substrate .    as in any numerical scheme ,",
    "we are limited by the system finite size . to check our predictions , we also simulated ( without showing results ) larger lateral system sizes of about @xmath73 , while the film thickness was kept the same as before , @xmath52 .",
    "as long as @xmath74 , we still obtain the perfect l@xmath26 phase .",
    "although our simulation results are indicative , they are not completely sufficient to predict that a similar combination of substrate topography and chemical preference can induce defect - free l@xmath26 for systems with much larger lateral size , as is required in experiments .",
    "this is a deficiency of all simulation schemes as the simulation box has a finite size that is often smaller than the experimental relevant sizes .",
    "in addition , as experiments have reported a dependence of the film orientation on its thickness  @xcite , we conjecture that a perfect l@xmath26 phase of different thicknesses or sizes requires different values of the roughness parameters ( @xmath5 and @xmath7 ) , and preference parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "this conjecture has yet to be confirmed in future studies .    in a fraction of our simulations , instead of obtaining a defect - free l@xmath75 phase , the system converged towards a tilted l@xmath26 phase .",
    "these tilted l@xmath26 lamellae have a perfect perpendicular orientation with respect to the substrate and are aligned with a small tilt angle with respect to the inplane direction of the l@xmath75 phase , but still without any inplane defects .",
    "we believe that such a tilt angle results from the finite system size in the simulations , given the influence of the vertical boundaries of the simulation box on the orientation of the l@xmath26 phase . as such tilted l@xmath26 phases still maintain a perfect lateral ordering , their existence will not affect the implications of our findings toward applications of thin bcp films in patterning technologies .",
    "the tendency of the l@xmath26 phase to align in the l@xmath75 direction that is orthogonal to the trenches ( as compared to the parallel one , l@xmath60 ) is shown in figs .  7 and 8 .",
    "from the figures it is observed that the free energy difference @xmath76 is always positive .",
    "this observation is consistent with previous theoretical findings and experiments  @xcite .",
    "pickett et al  @xcite proposed an explanation of why the l@xmath27 should be more stable than l@xmath28 for most bcp films and surface parameters . according to their explanation ,",
    "when the bcp chains are in contact with a corrugated substrate , the chain deformations are very different in the two l@xmath26 orientations . for the l@xmath27 ,",
    "the chains are oriented along the  smooth \" surface direction and they are almost not deformed , while for the l@xmath28 phase , the chains follow the contour of the substrate corrugation .",
    "this means that for the latter l@xmath28 phase , the chains are locally extended or compressed , which cost more energy .    furthermore , as can also be seen in figs .  7 and 8 , increasing the substrate roughness ( decreasing @xmath77 in fig .",
    "7 ) or substrate preference ( increasing @xmath22 in fig .",
    "8) causes @xmath64 to increase .",
    "this means that the l@xmath27 phase becomes more stable than the l@xmath28 phase as function of @xmath72 and @xmath22 .",
    "this tendency can be understood in terms of local extension or compression of the chains that is more pronounced in the l@xmath28 phase than in the l@xmath27 phase .",
    "for example , when the substrate preference towards the a component increases , the preferred a - rich domain close to the substrate will expand . as the chains follow the contour of the substrate corrugation in the l@xmath28 phase but it is parallel in l@xmath27 phase ,",
    "the cost energy of chain extension or compression increases more in the l@xmath28 phase than for l@xmath27 .",
    "therefore , increasing substrate roughness and preference simultaneously has a synergistic effect , which facilitates the stability of inplane defect - free perpendicular lamellar phases .",
    "the advantage of the weak segregation regime ( small @xmath78 ) of the bcp film is that it avoids getting trapped in a metastable structure with defects , because the mobility of the bcp chain is enhanced when the temperature is close to the odt .",
    "after equilibration , one can use thermal annealing to lower the temperature towards the desired strong segregation regime , while maintaining a perfect alignment .",
    "an interesting direction of extending the present study is to consider bcp blends . in experiments",
    "@xcite , such blends casted on rough substrates have been shown to enhanced the ordering of defect - free phases .",
    "we hope to further explore such films composed of bcp blends , given their great value in applications .    to the best of our knowledge , using the synergy between uni - directional corrugated substrates and a small preference field to produce defect - free phases has not yet been tested in experiments .",
    "future experimental verifications of these scenarios may bring us closer to producing large arrays of defect - free bcp structures , while employing simple and viable techniques .",
