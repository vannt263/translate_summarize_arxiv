    "there is a sufficient number of numerical and self - consistent methods to compute the one particle spectrum of a solid with good accuracy .",
    "however , in addition to this , it is desirable to have analytical solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "these solutions for multidimensional periodic potentials are useful both for a zero order perturbation theory and for the general theory .",
    "this allows us , for example , to gain a deeper understanding of spectral manifolds and corresponding eigenfunctions , as well as their geometrical and analytical properties .    among one - dimensional potentials ,",
    "the finite - gap ones are the most interesting and fruitful in the view of the physical results .",
    "the schrdinger equation with the finite - gap potential @xcite has an exact solution , the spectrum and eigenfunctions are defined by analytical functions .",
    "the kronig - penny potential @xcite consisting of rectangular wells is usually considered as the most elementary one in the quantum physics of solids . however , in order to determine the band structure that corresponds to this potential , it is necessary to solve transcendental equation and , furthermore , the appropriate eigenfunctions are too cumbersome to use them to calculate the matrix elements of any observables . the finite - gap potentials are free of these limitations .",
    "the matrix elements of any observable on the eigenfunctions that correspond to finite - gap potential can be calculated analytically by the residue method .",
    "furthermore , one can say that these potentials play the same role in solid - state physics as the kepler problem plays in atomic theory .",
    "it is known that generic periodic potential has generally an infinite set of gaps in the spectrum , but their width rapidly decreases as energy increases . if a potential is analytical , then the rate of decrease is exponential .",
    "therefore , provided narrow enough gaps in the spectrum are disregarded , any periodic potential can be approximated by a finite - gap potential .",
    "@xcite it turns out also that the finite - gap potentials are exact solutions of the peierls - frhlich problem on a self - consistent state of the lattice and conduction electrons . @xcite",
    "the simplest finite - gap potentials are the lame ones .",
    "@xcite they are expressed through the weierstrass function .",
    "the lame potentials are a subset of the darboux potentials , @xcite that are linear superpositions of the weierstrass functions with half - period shifts . whatever the number of gaps , all these potentials are characterized by only two parameters of the elliptic function .",
    "treibich and verdier rediscovered the darboux potentials and described them in algebraic - geometric terms of the tangent covers and studied their spectral properties .",
    "@xcite krichever suggested considering elliptic finite - gap potentials from the point of view a torus covering .",
    "@xcite using this approach , smirnov has presented a large list of these potentials .",
    "@xcite its and matveev derived a general formula that expresses an arbitrary finite - gap potential through the multidimensional riemann @xmath2-functions , the parameter number of which coincides with the number of band edges .",
    "@xcite    there are also multidimensional elliptic calogero - moser potentials , which their integrability was proved by olshanetsky and perelomov .",
    "@xcite    baryakhtar , belokolos and korostil suggested considering the schrdinger equation with three - dimensional separable potential as a sum of three one - dimensional finite - gap potentials along orthogonal directions .",
    "@xcite it is obvious that these potentials correspond to the orthorhombic lattice .",
    "the schrdinger equation with such a potential has the exact eigenfunctions and the spectrum is defined by analytical functions .",
    "the parameters that this model includes have simple physical sense .",
    "these parameters are related to the width of spectral gaps . as an example , let us consider separable elliptic finite - gap potentials .",
    "the weierstrass function has two independent parameters : the parameter @xmath3 defines the potential period , the parameter @xmath4 defines the gap width along corresponding direction of dual lattice .",
    "it is natural to consider the parameter @xmath5 as a characteristic of the relative width of gaps . as the value of @xmath6 increases , the corresponding gap width increases too .",
    "in one of the extreme cases , the width of all the gaps vanishes .",
    "it corresponds to the free electron model , while in the other extreme case , the width of all the bands vanishes and this corresponds to the tight binding model . in the model of separable finite - gap potentials , we can also easily study one- and two - dimensional lattices .",
    "this can be done by choosing extremely wide gaps along certain directions .",
    "finite - gap potentials have successfully been applied to solve different problems in solid - state physics .",
    "@xcite    in our paper , on one hand , we examine the known one - gap and two - gap separable lame potentials in detail . for the one - dimensional case , we construct the dispersion relation graph @xmath0 and for the three - dimensional case , we construct the fermi surfaces in the first and second bands .",
    "the following pictures illustrate a change from one extreme case of free electrons to the other extreme case of tight binding electrons .",
    "on the other hand , we use the separable one - gap lame potential to describe the lifshits electron phase transition of @xmath1 kind and derive some exact expressions . at the end",
    ", we consider singularities of the second derivative of the magnetic momentum of a normal metal in an external magnetic field .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present information on the one - dimensional lame potentials using two different approaches and the one - gap and two - gap ones",
    "are studied in detail . in section 3",
    ", we consider the separable finite - gap lame potentials and construct the fermi surfaces using the one - gap one . in section 4 , the one - gap separable lame potential is applied to describe the lifshits electron phase transition of @xmath1 kind . at the end of this section",
