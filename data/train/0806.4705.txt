    "in the framework of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the basic spin - averaged characteristics of heavy - flavor hadro- @xcite , photo- @xcite and electro - production @xcite are known exactly up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "although these explicit results are widely used at present for a phenomenological description of available data ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the key question remains open : how to test the applicability of qcd at fixed order to heavy - quark production ?",
    "the basic theoretical problem is that the nlo corrections are sizeable ; they increase the leading - order ( lo ) predictions for both charm and bottom production cross sections by approximately a factor of two .",
    "moreover , soft - gluon resummation of the threshold sudakov logarithms indicates that higher - order contributions can also be substantial .",
    "( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) on the other hand , perturbative instability leads to a high sensitivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters . for this reason",
    ", it is difficult to compare pqcd results for spin - averaged cross sections with experimental data directly , without additional assumptions .",
    "the total uncertainties associated with the unknown values of the heavy - quark mass , @xmath13 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath16 and the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are so large that one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for charm production cross sections in the entire energy range from the fixed - target experiments @xcite to the rhic collider @xcite .",
    "since these production cross sections have such slowly converging perturbative expansions , it is of special interest to study those observables that are well - defined in pqcd .",
    "a nontrivial example of such an observable was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the azimuthal @xmath17 asymmetry in heavy - quark photo- and leptoproduction was analyzed.@xmath18 in particular , the born - level results were considered @xcite and the nlo soft - gluon corrections to the basic mechanism , photon - gluon fusion , were calculated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the production cross sections , the azimuthal asymmetry in heavy - flavor photo- and leptoproduction is quantitatively well defined in pqcd : the contribution of the dominant photon - gluon fusion mechanism to the asymmetry is stable , both parametrically and perturbatively .",
    "therefore , measurements of this asymmetry should provide a useful test of pqcd . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the azimuthal asymmetry in open charm photoproduction could be measured with an accuracy of about ten percent in the approved e160/e161 experiments at slac @xcite using the inclusive spectra of secondary ( decay ) leptons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the photon-(heavy-)quark scattering contribution to @xmath19-dependent lepton - hadron deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) was investigated .",
    "it turned out that , contrary to the basic photon - gluon fusion component , the quark - scattering mechanism is practically @xmath17-independent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quark - scattering contribution to the @xmath17 asymmetry is , for kinematic reasons , absent at lo and is negligibly small at nlo , of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "this indicates that the azimuthal distributions in charm leptoproduction could be a good probe of the charm pdf in the proton .",
    "in the present paper , we continue the studies of perturbatively stable observables by considering the photon - gluon fusion mechanism in heavy - quark leptoproduction , @xmath21(p_{x } ) .",
    "\\label{1}\\ ] ] in the case of unpolarized initial states and neglecting the contribution of @xmath22-boson exchange , the cross section of reaction ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath23 f_{t } ( x , q^{2 } ) + 2\\left(1-y\\right ) f_{l}(x , q^{2})\\right\\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{2\\pi \\alpha^{2}_{\\mathrm{em}}}{xq^{4}}\\left\\ { \\left [ 1+(1-y)^{2}\\right ] f_{2 } ( x , q^{2 } ) -2xy^{2 } f_{l}(x , q^{2})\\right\\ } ,   \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is sommerfeld s fine - structure constant , @xmath25 and the kinematic variables are defined by @xmath26 in this paper , we investigate radiative corrections to the callan - gross ratio in heavy - quark leptoproduction , defined as @xmath27 first , we consider the exact nlo corrections to the quantity @xmath6 at low and moderate @xmath1 using explicit results @xcite .",
    "then , we analyze the high-@xmath8 regime with the help of the asymptotic nlo predictions for the structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . finally , the soft - gluon ( or threshold ) contributions are investigated in the large-@xmath3 region in the framework of the formalism developed in ref .  @xcite . to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy",
    ", we calculate the nlo and nnlo soft - gluon corrections to both structure functions .",
    "our main results can be formulated as follows :    * exact nlo corrections to the ratio @xmath28 do not exceed 10@xmath29 in the energy range @xmath30 at low and moderate @xmath1 .",
    "* at high @xmath31 , the asymptotic nlo corrections to @xmath28 are less than 10@xmath29 for @xmath32 .",
    "* at the nll level , the nlo and nnlo soft - gluon predictions for @xmath28 affect the lo results by less than a few percent at low and moderate @xmath8 and @xmath33 . * in all the cases mentioned above , the nlo predictions for @xmath6 are sufficiently insensitive , to within ten percent , to standard uncertainties in the qcd input parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath16 , and in the gluon pdf @xmath36 .",
    "we conclude that , in contrast to the production cross sections , the callan - gross ratio in heavy - quark leptoproduction is an observable quantitatively well defined in pqcd .",
    "perturbative stability of the photon - gluon fusion results for @xmath28 is mainly due to the cancellation of large radiative corrections to the structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 in their ratio , especially in the large-@xmath3 region .",
    "measurements of the quantity @xmath6 in charm and bottom leptoproduction should provide a good test of the conventional parton model based on pqcd .",
    "concerning the experimental aspects , perturbative stability of the qcd predictions for @xmath28 observed in our studies is very useful for the extraction of the structure functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the data .",
    "usually , it is the so - called  reduced cross section \" , @xmath37 , that can directly be measured in dis experiments : @xmath38 , \\label{6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39    in earlier hera analyses of charm and bottom electroproduction @xcite , the corresponding longitudinal structure functions were taken to be zero for simplicity . in this case , @xmath40 . in recent papers @xcite ,",
    "the structure function @xmath41 is evaluated from the reduced cross section ( [ 5 ] ) where the longitudinal structure function @xmath42 is estimated from the nlo qcd expectations . instead of this rather cumbersome procedure",
    ", we propose to use the expression ( [ 6 ] ) with the quantity @xmath43 calculated in lo approximation .",
    "this simplifies the extraction of @xmath41 from measurements of @xmath37 but does not affect the accuracy of the result in practice .    indeed",
    ", the lo corrections to the extracted function @xmath41 due to the non - zero value of @xmath43 can not exceed 30@xmath29 because the ratio @xmath44 is itself less than 0.3 practically in the entire region of the variables @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason , the nlo corrections to @xmath43 , having a relative size of the order of 10% , can not affect the value of @xmath41 by more than 3% .",
    "in reality , the effect of radiative corrections to @xmath43 on the extracted values of @xmath41 is less than 1@xmath29 since @xmath45 in most of the experimentally accessible kinematic range .    in the present paper ,",
    "we derive compact hadron - level lo predictions for the ratio @xmath44 in the limit of low @xmath46 . assuming the low-@xmath3 asymptotic behavior of the gluon pdf to be of the type @xmath47",
    ", we provide analytic result for the ratio @xmath48 for arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath49 in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "furthermore , we consider compact formulae for @xmath50 in two particular cases : @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the simplest case , @xmath53 , which has already been studied recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , leads to a non - singular behavior of the structure functions for @xmath46 .",
    "the second choice , @xmath51 , historically originates from the bfkl resummation of the leading powers of @xmath54 @xcite .    in principle , the parameter @xmath49 is a function of @xmath8 and this dependence is calculated using the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "however , our analysis shows that hadron - level predictions for @xmath55 depend weakly on @xmath49 practically in the entire region of @xmath8 for @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , the relative difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 is less than few percent at @xmath59 . for this reason , our simple formula for @xmath50 with @xmath60 ( i.e. , without any evolution ) describes with good accuracy the low-@xmath3 predictions for @xmath61 of the cteq pdf versions @xcite .",
    "we see that the hadron - level predictions for @xmath55 are stable not only under the nlo corrections to the partonic cross sections , but also under the dglap evolution of the gluon pdf .",
    "finally , we show that our compact lo formulae for @xmath50 conveniently reproduce the hera results for @xmath11 and @xmath12 obtained by h1 collaboration @xcite with the help of more cumbersome nlo estimations of @xmath42 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ nlo ] ,",
    "we analyze the exact nlo results for the callan - gross ratio at low and moderate @xmath1 and the asymptotic nlo predictions at high @xmath31 .",
    "the soft - gluon contributions to @xmath28 are investigated in section  [ sgr ] . to nll accuracy",
    ", we calculate the threshold nlo and nnlo corrections to both structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the analytic lo results for the ratio @xmath44 at low @xmath3 are discussed in section  [ analytic ] .",
    "at lo , @xmath62 , leptoproduction of heavy flavors proceeds through the photon - gluon fusion mechanism , @xmath63 the relevant feynman diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "the @xmath64 cross sections , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , have the form @xcite : @xmath67 \\ln\\frac{1+\\beta_{z}}{1-\\beta_{z}}- \\left[1 + 4z(1-z)(\\lambda-2)\\right]\\beta_{z}\\right\\ } ,   \\label{9}\\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{l}^{(0)}(z,\\lambda)&=&\\frac{2\\alpha_{s}(\\mu_r^2)}{\\pi}\\hat{\\sigma}_{b}(z)z \\left\\{-2\\lambda z\\ln\\frac{1+\\beta_{z}}{1-\\beta_{z}}+\\left(1-z\\right)\\beta_{z}\\right\\ } , \\label{10}\\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{t}^{(0)}(z,\\lambda)&=&\\hat{\\sigma}_{2}^{(0)}(z,\\lambda ) -\\hat{\\sigma}_{l}^{(0)}(z,\\lambda),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the electric charge of quark @xmath70 in units of the positron charge and @xmath71 is the strong - coupling constant . in eqs .",

    "the leptoproduction cross sections @xmath73 are related to the structure functions @xmath76 as follows : @xmath77      at nlo , @xmath78 , the contribution of the photon - gluon component is usually presented in terms of the dimensionless coefficient functions @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , as @xmath81\\right\\}+{\\cal o}(\\alpha_{s}^2).\\ ] ] where we identify @xmath82 .    in this paper",
    ", we neglect the @xmath83 fusion subprocesses .",
    "this is justified as their contributions to heavy - quark leptoproduction vanish at lo and are small at nlo @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "the light - quark - initiated corrections to both @xmath84 and @xmath85 structure functions are negative and less than @xmath7 in a wide kinematic range @xcite .",
    "our estimates show that these contributions cancel in the ratio @xmath0 with an accuracy less than few percent .",
    "the coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the @xmath88-dependent logarithms can be evaluated explicitly using renormalization group arguments @xcite .",
    "the results of direct calculations of the coefficient functions @xmath89 ( @xmath80 ) are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . using these nlo predictions",
    ", we compute the @xmath3 dependence of the ratio @xmath0 at several values of @xmath90 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we conclude by summarizing our main observations . in the present paper",
    ", we studied the radiative corrections to the callan - gross ratio @xmath28 in heavy - quark leptoproduction .",
    "we considered the exact nlo results at low and moderate @xmath1 , asymptotic nlo predictions at high @xmath31 , and both nlo and nnlo soft - gluon ( or threshold ) corrections at large bjorken @xmath3 .",
    "it turned out that large ( especially , at non - small @xmath3 ) radiative corrections to the structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 cancel each other in their ratio @xmath0 with good accuracy . as a result , the nlo contributions to the ratio @xmath28 are less than @xmath7 in a wide region of the variables @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "our analysis also shows that the nlo predictions for @xmath6 are sufficiently insensitive ( to within ten percent ) to standard uncertainties in the qcd input parameters .",
    "we conclude that , unlike the production cross sections , the callan - gross ratio in heavy - quark leptoproduction is quantitatively well defined in pqcd .",
    "measurements of the quantity @xmath6 in charm and bottom leptoproduction would provide a good test of the conventional parton model based on pqcd .",
    "concerning the experimental aspects , we propose to exploit the observed perturbative stability of the callan - gross ratio in the extraction of the structure functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the corresponding reduced cross sections . for this purpose , we provided compact lo hadron - level formulae for the ratio @xmath91 in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "we demonstrated that these analytic expressions simplify the extraction of @xmath41 without affecting the accuracy of the result in practice .",
    "in particular , our lo formula for @xmath43 with @xmath51 usefully reproduces the results for @xmath11 and @xmath12 obtained by the h1 collaboration @xcite with the help of the more cumbersome nlo evaluation of @xmath42 .    in this paper , we investigated the contribution to @xmath6 from the dominant mechanism , photon - gluon fusion , within the fixed - flavor - number scheme . to take into account the photon - heavy - quark scattering component , one should adopt the variable - flavor - number scheme , which allows one to resum potentially large mass logarithms of the type @xmath92 , whose contribution dominates at @xmath93 .",
    "some recent developments concerning this scheme may be found in ref .",
    "the variable - flavor - number - scheme predictions for the callan - gross ratio as well as the possibility to discriminate experimentally between photon - gluon fusion and quark - scattering contributions to @xmath6 will be considered in a forthcoming publication .",
