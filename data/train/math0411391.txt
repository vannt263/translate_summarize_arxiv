    "moreover , ideas of barrios - lpez - saff @xcite played a role in the further analysis .    throughout",

    "a measure is described by its verblunsky coefficients @xmath7 which enter in the szeg recursion @xmath8 where @xmath9    @xmath10 has all its zeros in @xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.7.1 ) .",
    "we let @xmath12 be the pure point measure on @xmath11 which gives weight @xmath13 to each zero of @xmath10 of multiplicity @xmath14 . for simplicity",

    "here is the theorem of mhaskar - saff @xcite :    t1.1 if and hold , then @xmath12 converges weakly to the uniform measure on the circle of radius @xmath20 .",
    "we note that both this result and the one of nevai - totik @xcite i will mention in a moment define @xmath20 by @xmath21 and the mhaskar - saff result holds for @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a subsequence with @xmath24 .",
    "i want to say a bit about the proof of theorem  [ t1.1 ] in part because i will need a slight refinement of the first part ( which is from nevai - totik @xcite ) and in part because i want to make propaganda for a new proof @xcite of the second part .",
    "the proof starts with ideas from nevai - totik @xcite that hold when @xmath19 :    by and @xmath25 , one sees inductively that @xmath26 and so , by the maximum principle and , @xmath27    by , @xmath28 if @xmath29 by .",
    "thus , in the disk @xmath30 , @xmath31 has a limit .",
    "since @xmath19 , the szeg condition ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) ) holds , so @xmath32 on @xmath11 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.4.1 ) ) , we conclude that @xmath33 has an analytic continuation to the disk of radius @xmath34 and holds there .",
    "( nevai - totik also prove a converse : if the szeg condition holds , @xmath35 and @xmath33 has an analytic continuation to the disk of radius @xmath34 , then @xmath36 . )    when holds , @xmath37 is analytic in @xmath11 and continuous on @xmath38 so @xmath33 has no zeros in @xmath38 .",
    "we define the nevai - totik points @xmath39 ( @xmath40 in @xmath41 ) with @xmath42 to be all the solutions of @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "since holds and @xmath45 , hurwitz s theorem implies that the @xmath46 are precisely the limit points of zeros of @xmath47 in the region @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 , @xmath50 so we conclude that for each @xmath51 , the number of zeros of @xmath47 in @xmath52 is bounded as @xmath53 .",
    "that concludes our summary of some of the results from nevai - totik .",
    "the next step is from mhaskar - saff .    by",
    ", if @xmath54 are the zeros of @xmath5 counting multiplicity , then @xmath55 so , by , @xmath56 this together with ( 3 ) implies that the bulk of zeros must asymptotically lie on the circle of radius @xmath20 and , in particular , any limit point of @xmath12 must be a measure on @xmath57 .",
    "mhaskar - saff complete the proof by using potential theory to analyze the limit points of the @xmath58 .",
    "instead , i will sketch a different idea from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  8.2 ) that exploits the cmv matrix ( see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "thus the moments of the limit points of the cesaro average @xmath73 are the same as the moments of the limits of @xmath68 ( so if @xmath68 has a limit that lives on @xmath74 , @xmath75 has the same limit ) .",
    "second , a theorem like mhaskar - saff holds in many other situations .",
    "for example , if @xmath76 is periodic and @xmath77 , then the @xmath12 converge to the equilibrium measure for the essential support of @xmath2 , which is a finite number of intervals .",
    "( see ed saff s book with totik @xcite . )",
    "one critical feature of the mhaskar - saff theorem is its universality .",
    "so long as we look at cases where and hold , the angular distribution is the same .",
    "our main goal here is to go beyond the universal setup where the results will depend on more detailed assumptions on asymptotics . in particular",
    ", we will want to consider two stronger conditions than root asymptotics , , namely , ratio asymptotics @xmath78 for some @xmath79 and what we will call bls asymptotics ( or the bls condition ) : @xmath80 where @xmath79 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the name bls is for barrios - lpez - saff @xcite who proved    t1.2 a set of verblunsky coefficients obeys the bls condition if and only if @xmath35 and the numeric inverse of the szeg function @xmath33 , defined initially for @xmath83 , has a meromorphic continuation to a disk of radius @xmath84 for some @xmath85 which is analytic except for a single pole at @xmath86 .",

    "it is the single nevai - totik zero in this case . that there are no limiting zeros inside @xmath106 is no accident ; see corollary  1 of @xcite and theorem  [ t7.2 ] below . and the zeros certainly seem uniformly distributed  indeed , when i first ran the program that generated figure  1 , i was impressed by how uniform the distribution seemed to be , even for @xmath108 .",

    "my initial thought was that the roughness was trying to emulate the pure point spectrum .",
    "i now think i was wrong in both initial reactions .    for figure  2 ,",
    "i should have made the connection with work of molchanov @xcite and minami @xcite who proved in the case of random schrdinger operators that , locally , eigenvalues in a large box had poisson distribution .",
    "this leads to a conjecture .",

    "i base the precise @xmath134 and @xmath135 on the results of stoiciu @xcite , but i would regard as very interesting any result that showed , except for a small fraction ( even if not as small as @xmath136 ) , all zeros are very close ( even if not as close as @xmath134 ) for @xmath74 .",
    "there is one aspect of this conjecture that is stronger than what is proven for the schrdinger case .",
    "the results of molchanov @xcite and minami @xcite are the analog of conjecture  [ con2.1 ] if @xmath137 , which i would call a local poisson structure . that there is independence of distant intervals",
    "is conjectured here but not proven in the schrdinger case . that this is really an extra result",
    "can be seen by the fact that figure  2 is likely showing local poisson structure about any @xmath138 , but because the @xmath125 s are real , the set of zeros is invariant under complex conjugation , so intervals about , say , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are not independent .    as far as figure  1 is concerned",
    ", it is remarkably regular so there is an extra phenomenon leading to    if for @xmath79 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 converges to @xmath143 sufficiently fast , then the non - nevai - totik zeros approach @xmath144 and the angular distance between nearby zeros in @xmath145 .",

    "this is only claimed for local behavior .",
    "we will see that , typically , errors in the distance between the zeros are @xmath146 and will add up to shift zeros that are a finite distance from each other relative to a strict clock .",
    "clock behavior has been discussed for oprl .",
    "szeg @xcite has @xmath147 upper and lower bounds ( different @xmath143 s ) in many cases and erds - turan @xcite prove local clock behavior under hypotheses on the measure , but their results do not cover all jacobi polynomials . in section  [ s6new ] , we will prove a clock result for a class of oprl in terms of their jacobi matrix parameters ( @xmath148 ) , and in section  [ s6 ] , a simple analysis that proves local clock behavior for jacobi polynomials .",

    "this is most easily seen by looking at the distribution function for distance between nearest zeros scaled to the local density .",
    "for the poisson case , there is a constant density , while for clock , it is a point mass at a point @xmath151 depending on normalization . for the standard random matrix ( gue , goe , cue ) ,",

    "since the proof is involved and the earlier papers have a reputation of being difficult , it seems useful to summarize here the strategy of stoiciu s proof .    following minami , a key step is the proof of what are sometimes called fractional moment bounds and which i like to call aizenman - molchanov bounds after their first appearance in @xcite .",
