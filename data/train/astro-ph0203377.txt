    "this school on the historical development of modern cosmology is taking place when the university of valencia celebrated 500 years of uninterrupted academic and scientific activity .",
    "let me start the introductory talk with a prelude regarding some astronomical events that happened at the very beginning of the university s existence .",
    "a few years after the foundation of the university , jeroni munys , professor of astronomy , mathematics and hebrew at this university , studied the famous type i supernova within the constellation of cassiopeia , which appeared in 1572 ( tycho s supernova ) and wrote a small book commissioned by the king felipe ii .",
    "the book ( see fig .",
    "1 ) was entitled    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ libro del nuevo cometa , y del lugar donde se hazen ; y como se ver por las parallaxes , qun lexos estn de tierra ... + ( book on the new comet , and the place where it can be found , and as it can be seen from its parallax how far away it is from earth ... ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    munys knew that the new star could be used as an observational evidence against the aristotelian concept of the immutability of the cosmos , and of course , this work brought him some problems with the political and ecclesiastic authorities of the time .",
    "nevertheless , tycho brahe knew munys s work well and , in a book ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in which tycho discusses the work by other astronomers on the new star , he includes a chapter devoted to munys s book ( navarro brotns and rodrguez galdeano 1998 ) .",

    "in the book by h. kragh ( 1996 ) , we can read :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in spite of cosmology s amazing development in this century and the strong scientific and public interest in the new science of the universe , only very little is known of how this development took place . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    also in his book , kragh quotes y. zeldovich and i. novikov ( 1983 ) from their book _ structure and evolution of the universe _ :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the history of the universe is infinitely more interesting than the history of the study of the universe . \" _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    undoubtedly , this view is still shared by many professional astronomers .",
    "nevertheless , it is our responsibility to provide future generations of scholars in this field with a truthful account of how the present cosmological paradigm has been constructed from the contributions of many people .",
    "this school points in this direction and these proceedings will probably help to increase the general knowledge of how our concept of the universe has been changing during the last 80 years , a period in which cosmology has experienced a dramatic development .",
    "sometimes controversy between alternative theories was present in this history . the steady state model and",
    "the big bang model , with once - strong arguments supported by prestigious defenders on both sides , is a good example of controversial science .",
    "these arguments are nicely explained in the chapters by kragh ( p. 157 ) , gold ( p. 171 ) , and narlikar ( p. 175 ) .",
    "the new cosmological ideas soon permeated society .",
    "it is well known that the term  big bang \" was coined ironically by one of the founders of the steady state theory , sir fred hoyle , during a bbc radio interview .",
    "two talks of this school will be devoted to the popularization of cosmology : ten ( p. 309 ) focuses on the ideas at the beginning of the twentieth century and hawkins ( p. 325 ) discusses the modern methods of disseminating discoveries about the universe .",
    "how did this history begin ?",
    "we could start from many different significant moments and discoveries .",
    "i like to remember the comet hunters during the eighteenth and the nineteenth century .",
    "the catalog of extended objects , compiled by charles messier ( 1730 - 1817 ) to avoid their being confused with new comets , is the first listing of nebulae widely referenced by later astronomers .",
    "lord rosse discovered the spiral structure of some of these nebulae using his 1.8-meter reflecting telescope at birr castle ( ireland ) .",
    "his drawing of m51 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) has a remarkable resemblance with modern images of this spiral galaxy .",
    "the nature of the nebulae and their possible extragalactic character was one of the items discussed in the debate on the distance scale of the universe , held in washington on 26 april 1920 between harlow shapley of mt .",
    "wilson ( soon after director of harvard college observatory ) and heber d. curtis of lick ( later director of allegheny observatory ) .",
    "shapley placed the sun far from the center of a galaxy 300000 light years in diameter and the spiral nebulae inside it .",
    "curtis instead put the sun at the center of a 30000 light year galaxy and the nebulae outside it as concentrations of stars similar to the milky way .",
    "it is clear that shapley was entirely right about the location of the sun , and more nearly right about the distance scales , but curtis was right about the nebulae .",
    "the definitive clarification of the controversy came with edwin hubble in 1925 ( but see also the contributions by ernst pik and knut lundmark explained by einasto on p. 85 and by trimble on p. 375 ) .",
    "hubble discovered cepheid variable stars in ngc 6822 and in andromeda ( 1925a , b ) .",
    "he estimated the distance to andromeda using the period  luminosity relationship introduced by henrietta leavitt in 1908 . although still underestimated , the distance obtained by hubble , 900000 light years , was the end of shapley s universe .",
    "this measurement , together with the morphological classification of galaxies and the discovery of the universal cosmic expansion , were the major contributions of hubble to the field .",
    "moreover , hubble s law the redshift ",
    "velocity relation is one of the most important breakthroughs in science that have happened during the twentieth century ( see the contribution by christianson on p. 145 . )    = 6.05 cm    = 6.534 cm    during the eighteenth century immanuel kant and johann lambert conceived the idea of a hierarchical universe of stars clustered into large systems ( galaxies ) , which in turn are clustered into larger systems , and so on .",
    "hierarchical clustering as a solution of olber s paradox was proposed by john herschel and richard proctor in the nineteenth century .",
    "the same idea was taken up in the twentieth century by carl charlier .",
    "the first talk after this introduction deals precisely with olber s paradox ( hoskin p. 11 ) .",
    "despite the beauty of the hierarchical universe , this idea was not widely accepted . in fact , one of the tenets of modern cosmology was the cosmological principle .",
    "the principle was first formulated by e. milne in 1933 as the assumption that the large - scale unverse is spatially homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "many authors in this volume regard the publication of the theory of general relativity by albert einstein in 1915 ( einstein 1915a , b ) as the birth of modern cosmology .",
    "as soon as 1919 , the first experimental test of the theory of general relativity was performed in the expeditions led by sir arthur eddington and andrew crommelin to measure , during a total solar eclipse , the bending of light rays from background stars by the sun ( see coles on p. 21 )    in 1917 einstein applied his equations of general relativity to the description of the universe , assuming the cosmological principle .",
    "this assumption was adopted mainly for simplicity , and needed to be confirmed by observations . when the first maps of the distribution of galaxies , both in projection and later in redshift space , became available , a clumpy distribution was revealed . in the 1970s ,",
    "peebles and co - workers used statistical descriptors such as the two - point correlation function to conclude that the small - scale clustering of galaxies was compatible with a fractal distribution , and therefore a transition to homogeneity had to happen if the cosmological principle was to be preserved .",
    "observations of redshifts of galaxies out to 15000 km / sec and beyond , the isotropy of the x - ray background , and especially of the microwave background eventually confirmed the principle .",
    "but data sets from the 1960s to the 1980s showed structure nearly as large as the survey volumes and left the issue open in the minds of some astronomers .",
    "the arrangement of matter in the universe , how galactic structures have been formed and how they can be statistically described are the main topics of the contributions by peebles ( p. 201 ) , jones ( 245 ) , and icke ( p. 337 ) .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations have played an important role in recent years in exploring the consequences of different scenarios for the formation and evolution of large scale structure in the universe ( see yepes on p. 355 ) .",
    "einstein introduced the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , in his field equations to guarantee a static universe .",
    "some years later , and after the discovery by hubble of the expansion of the universe , he considered this introduction as his biggest blunder ( see heller on p. 121 ) .",
    "nevertheless , recent observations ( riess et al . 1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) of very distant type ia supernovae have resurrected the cosmological constant , interpreting it as the imprint of an exotic kind of energy that could be a possible explanation for a universe with accelerated expansion ( silk p. 109 ) .",
    "the solutions of the einstein equations obtained by the russian mathematician alexander friedmann ( 1922 ) and the belgian mathematician ( and priest ) george lematre ( 1927 ) ( see blanchard on p. 237 ) were the basis for the standard cosmological model of a dense , hot , and expanding universe .",
    "some of the more influential contributions in the 1930s were the einstein - de sitter flat model ( 1931 ) , and the papers by robertson ( 1933 ) and tolman ( 1934 ) .",
    "the problem of the singularity at the beginning of the history of the universe is discussed at length by heller ( p. 121 ) .      during the first few minutes after the big bang the formation of light elements took place .",
    "one of the first works on this  primordial nucleosynthesis \" is the famous @xmath1 paper published in 1948 ( alpher , bethe , and gamow 1948 ) . during the fifties and sixties , different calculations of the relative proportions of hydrogen , helium , deuterium and lithium within the framework of the big bang model showed an excellent agreement with the present - day observed abundances .",
    "this was the first theoretical prediction of the new cosmological model confirmed by the observations .      in 1965 , the american radio astronomers arno penzias and robert wilson detected the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "the existence of this diffuse radiation is naturally explained in the big bang model .",
    "when the age of the universe was about 300000 years , the universe had cooled enough to make possible the formation of stable hydrogen atoms for the first time ( epoch of recombination ) . at this stage ,",
    "the universe becomes transparent , because the electromagnetic radiation and matter decouple .",
    "indeed alpher and herman ( 1950 ) had predicted that such radiation should exist at a temperature of about 5k .",
    "the reported detection by penzias and wilson was published in the astrophysical journal . in a paper published in the same issue of the journal , robert dicke ,",
    "james peebles , peter roll , and david wilkinson explained the cosmological origin of this radiation . without any doubt , this discovery was the strongest observational evidence supporting the big bang model .",
    "the news appeared on the first page of the new york times on 21 may 1965 . since then , the cosmic microwave radiation , as an observed fossil of the early universe , has been one of the main targets of observational cosmology , carried out wiht the cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) satellite , the boomerang balloon experiment , and from the ground . after 1965 ,",
    "the big - bang model becomes the generally accepted cosmological model , overshadowing the steady state theory .",
    "the contributions by novikov ( p. 43 ) and by silk ( p. 109 ) deal with the cmb observations , their discovery , their analysis and their cosmological implications , for example the flatness of the universe .",
    "summarizing , the hot big bang model accounts for three observational facts :    * the current expansion of the universe . * the cosmic microwave background radiation . * the relative abundance of light chemical elements .",
    "these successes are important , but the model needs several more ingredients to provide a complete picture of the origin and evolution of the universe :    1 .   * cosmological parameters . *",
    "+ alan sandage ( 1970 ) once described cosmology as the search for two numbers , the hubble constant and the deceleration parameter ( the latter is , for a model with zero cosmological constant , half the density parameter @xmath2 . ) a few more numbers are considered today as fundamental parameters in modern versions of cosmological models ( silk p. 109 ; trimble p. 375 ; see also rees 2001 ) .",
    "inflation*. the successful description of the universe , provided by the big bang model , leaves many questions open such as _ why is the universe so homogeneous , so isotropic , and so flat?_. a 1990s answer is the idea that the very early universe passed through a period of exponential expansion , called inflation ( kolb p. 295 ; bonometto p. 219 ) .",
    "* dark matter .",
    "* one of the first mentions of missing mass or dark matter came from zwicky ( 1933 ) , who had measured the velocity dispersion in the coma cluster and applied the virial theorem .",
    "the acceptance of the dark matter was a very slow process ( see the contribution by van den bergh on p. 75 . ) in any case , it took longer than the more recent general acceptance of the existence of dark energy ( see kolb on p. 295 and",
    "bonometto on p. 219 . )",
    "the contribution of the tartu astronomers to the dark matter problem was remarkable ( einasto p. 85 . )",
    "the evidence provided by the rotation curves in spiral galaxies was overwhelming ( rubin et al . 1978 ) .",
    "these curves indicated that spiral galaxies contain at least 10 times more dark matter than luminous matter ( see fig .",
    "different kinds of dark matter enter as contributors for the total density of the universe ( trimble 1987 ) .",
    "the role of neutrinos is explained in this volume by valle ( p 275 . )",
    "cosmology is a science driven by observations and observations are driven today by technological developments ( longair p. 55 . )",
    "the technologies to be developed in the 21st century will provide deeper insights into the universe .",
    "many problems are still open . some of them are part of what bonometto ( p. 219 ) calls post - modern cosmology , which addresses questions such as _ what happened before the big bang ? _ or _ are we living in one universe amongst many others ?",
    "_ moreover , the present model seems too elaborate , requiring fine - tuned values for the parameters and many different contributions to the total density ( kolb p. 295 . ) in any case the nature of dark matter and dark energy is still unknown . in my opinion , although we can be proud of the knowledge of the universe acquired during the last years , honestly ( and modestly ) we have to admit that it is only the tip of the iceberg .",
