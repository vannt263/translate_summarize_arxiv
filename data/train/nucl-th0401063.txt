    "light exotic - nuclei with one or two weakly bound neutrons in their halo offer the opportunity to study large systems at small nuclear density .",
    "( a review on the theoretical approaches and characteristics of halo nuclei can be found in ref .",
    "the constituents of the halo have a high probability to be found much beyond the interaction range .",
    "then , the concept of a short - range interaction between the particles and its implications are useful in understanding the few - body physics of the halo . the quantum description of such large and weakly bound systems are universal and can be defined by few physical scales despite the range and details of the pairwise interaction  @xcite .",
    "the particular halo - nuclei , with a neutron - neutron - core ( @xmath2 ) structure , like @xmath3he , @xmath0li , @xmath1be and @xmath4c , are examples of weakly - bound three - body systems  @xcite , where the above universal aspects can be explored theoretically  @xcite .    in weakly bound three - body systems , when the two - particle s - wave scattering lengths have large magnitudes , it is possible the occurrence of excited s - wave efimov states  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that these states could be present in some halo nuclei",
    ". this possibility was further investigated and refined in ref .",
    "a parametric region was determined in which efimov states can exist .",
    "such region , for a bound three - body system , was defined in a plane given by the two possible ( bound or virtual ) subsystem energies . the promising candidate to exhibit an excited efimov state",
    "was found to be @xmath4c  @xcite .",
    "a few - body system interacting through a short range force can be parameterized by few physical scales  @xcite .",
    "for a zero - range force in three - space dimensions , it is expected a new physical scale for each new particle added to the system , unless symmetry and/or angular momentum forbids the particles to be near each other .",
    "the three - body system in the state of zero total angular momentum , has the bound or virtual subsystems energies and the ground state three - body energy as the dominating physical scales .",
    "any observable can be expressed in terms of the ratios between the physical scales , given by a scaling function , when the scattering length goes to infinity , or the interaction range tends to zero ( scaling limit )  @xcite . in that sense the scaling function is an useful tool to study three - body observables and provides a zero order approximation to guide realistic calculations with short - range interactions .",
    "the scaling functions allow one to easily perform systematic studies of various three - body halo - nuclei properties with different types of two - body subsystems as , for example , @xmath3he , @xmath0li , @xmath1be and @xmath4c  @xcite .",
    "a classification scheme proposed for a bound three - body system  @xcite , can be investigated in terms of a scaling function for the different average distances between the constituents of a neutron - neutron - core halo nucleus .",
    "the classification of the three - body halo system depends on the kind of the two - body subsystems , bound or virtual .    for the case of two identical particles in the three - body system",
    ", we have to consider four possibilities for the two - body subsystems ( see figure 1 ) : all unbound ( _ borromean _ ) ; all bound ( _ all - bound _ ) ; one bound and two unbound ( _ tango _  @xcite configuration ) ; and one unbound with two bound ( we suggest a name _ samba _ for this configuration ) .",
    "one natural example of halo - nuclei _ samba _ system is the @xmath4c nucleus , which is composed by two - neutrons and a @xmath5c core . the neutron and @xmath5c forms the weakly bound state of @xmath6c  @xcite .    in the present work , we study the root - mean - square distances between the constituents of a bound three - body system , where we have two identical particles @xmath7 and a core named @xmath8 . by @xmath7",
    "we mean neutron in halo nuclei , but we allow the pair neutron - neutron ( @xmath9 ) to be bound in order to cover all the configurations presented above .",
    "we represent the radii in a scaling plot in terms of a dimensionless product , extending to halo nuclei a previous application that was done for molecules  @xcite . using these scaling plots we can follow the behavior of the different radii when it happens a transition between one kind of system to another one . starting from the _ borromean _ case ( all unbound )",
    ", we can go to the _ samba _ case by increasing the binding energy of the pair @xmath10 ( keeping @xmath9 unbound ) ; and to the _ tango _ case by increasing the binding energy of the pair @xmath9 ( keeping @xmath10 unbound ) .",
    "in particular , we calculate the mean square distance between the two neutrons in @xmath3he , @xmath0li and @xmath1be ( which have been measured recently  @xcite ) from the known bound or virtual energies of the subsystems and the two - neutron separation energy .",
    "the calculation of the scaling function for the different radii of the three - body system is performed with a renormalization scheme applied to three - body equations with @xmath11wave zero - range pairwise potential , which makes use of subtracted equations  @xcite .    as our approach",
    "is restricted to @xmath11wave two - body interactions , some limitations in the application of our analysis are expected .",
    "the argument has the origin in the fact that , in some cases , the two - body subsystem interaction in @xmath12wave is considered to be important for the three - body binding .",
    "the examples are @xmath3he  @xcite , known to be bound by the @xmath12wave interaction in @xmath13he ; and @xmath0li , where both @xmath12 and @xmath11waves might be relevant to describe the ground state of the unbound subsystem @xmath14li ( see discussion and references in @xcite ) . however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite ( in a discussion related to @xmath0li ) , one should also noticed that even the three - body wave function with @xmath11wave @xmath9 correlation produces a ground state of the halo nuclei with two or more shell - model configurations .",
    "the effect of the above @xmath11wave restriction is also reduced due to the fact that we are considering the experimental energies in our approach , which implicitly are carrying the effect of higher partial waves in the interaction .",
    "another aspect is that the radius are obtained from the tail of the wave - function , which is dominated by the @xmath11wave .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present our formalism , which contains the subtracted method to treat the faddeev equations with two identical particles , leading to the form factors from which we obtain the different mean - square radii . we also give a brief discussion of the scaling functions to describe the radii . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the classification scheme . in section iv , we present our numerical results for the root - mean - square distances between the particles .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "in the next subsection , we consider the formalism given in refs .",
    "@xcite for coupled channels to calculate the three - body wave functions and the possible different radii with a zero - range pairwise interaction .",
    "we solve the homogeneous three - body faddeev equations for a system with two identical particles @xmath15 and a third one @xmath16 in a renormalized subtracted form , which allows one to obtain the observables as a function of the two and three - body scales of the system .",

    "the details of the interaction are unimportant to describe few - body systems , as the short - range informations , beyond the two - body scattering lengths , are carried out by one typical three - body scale .",
    "therefore , the low - energy observables present a scaling behavior quite universal with the three - body binding energy  @xcite . in the limit of infinite scattering lengths or zero range interactions , the function which represents a given correlation between two three - body observables , written in terms of scaled variables , converges to a single curve , despite the existence of many other efimov states .    for a three - body system with binding energy @xmath33 , in the _ scaling limit _",

    "the calculations of the average distances of the neutrons in the halo of @xmath3he , @xmath0li , @xmath1be and @xmath4c are shown in table i and compared with the available experimental data . for the input , we have considered @xmath130 mev and the center of the available experimental values of @xmath33 and @xmath131 .",
    "for the cases that we have unbound virtual @xmath10 systems , the @xmath131 input values are taken from several recent theoretical and experimental analysis ; we prefer to keep at least two possible values in order to verify the consistency of the model with the experimental data .    within the possible limitations of our approach , by comparing our results for the @xmath9 mean - square radius with the experimental ones , which are known in the cases of @xmath3he , @xmath0li and @xmath1be , as given in table 1",
    ", one can also predict the corresponding virtual energies of the @xmath10 subsystem .    in the particular case of @xmath3he , the comparison between the experimental @xmath9 mean - square radius with our result is pointing out to a virtual energy close to zero for @xmath13he , which is not supported by the quite large values given in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the interaction for @xmath13he is attractive in @xmath12wave and repulsive in @xmath11wave producing a large value for the energy of the virtual state , such that a deviation of our calculation from the experimental result is expected ( in our model the @xmath11wave poles should be near the scattering thresholds ) . for the binding of @xmath0li",
    ", it is also known that both @xmath12 and @xmath11waves are important in the subsystem @xmath88li .",
    "this fact can also explain some deviations of our results when compared with experimental ones .",
    "however , in this last case , our approach can be more reliable based on the fact that : _ ( i ) _ the @xmath11wave @xmath88li interaction is attractive and it has a virtual state near the scattering region ; _ ( ii ) _ we are considering the experimental energies for the inputs , such that we are partially taking into account the effect of higher partial waves in the interactions ; _ ( iii ) _ the radius is obtained from the tail of the wave - function , which is dominated by the @xmath11wave ; _ ( iv ) _ as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , even the three - body wave function with @xmath11wave @xmath9 correlation produces a ground state of the halo nuclei with two or more shell - model configurations .",
    "one should also expect that other effects like the finite size of the core and pauli principle , missing in our model , could affect the average relative distances , if the three - body wave function would overlap appreciably with the core .",
    "at least for @xmath0li this is not expected due to the small binding .",
    "it is of notice that indeed the halo neutrons have a large probability to be in a region in which the wave function is an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian , and thus dominated by few asymptotic scales .",
    "the mean - square radii of a light halo - nuclei modelled as a three - body system ( two neutrons @xmath7 and a core @xmath8 ) are calculated using a renormalized three - body model with a pairwise dirac-@xmath132 interaction , which works with a minimal number of physical inputs directly related to observables .",
    "these physical scales are the two - neutron separation energy @xmath133 , and the @xmath9 and @xmath134core @xmath11wave scattering lengths .",
    "the existent data for @xmath0li and @xmath1be compare qualitatively well with our theoretical results , which means that the neutrons of the halo have a large probability to be found outside the interaction range .",
    "therefore the low - energy properties of these halo neutrons are , to a large extend , model independent as long as few physical input scales are fixed .",
    "the model provides a good insight into the three - body structure of halo nuclei , even considering some of its limitations .",
    "we pointed out that the model is restricted to @xmath11wave subsystems , with small energies for the bound or virtual states .",
    "so , the model is not suitable for the @xmath3he , since the @xmath11wave virtual state energy of @xmath84he is quite large ( -4  mev ) .",
    "there is no @xmath134core @xmath12wave interaction , although some of its physics is effectively included through the value of the two - neutron separation energy , which is an input for our radii calculations .",
    "also the finite size of the core and consequently the antisymmetrization of the total nuclear wave function , are both missing in our model .",
    "however , as the three - body halo nuclei tend to be more and more weakly bound with subsystems that have bound or virtual states near the scattering threshold , our approach becomes adequated and the above limitations are softened .",
    "the results indicate that the model is reasonable for @xmath0li and @xmath1be .",
    "we have also studied in detail the consequences of the classification scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for weakly bound three - body systems .",
    "this study was performed analyzing the dimensionless products @xmath136 and @xmath137 in terms of scaling functions depending on the dimensionless product of the scattering lengths and the square - root of the neutron - neutron separation energy . in the cases we have addressed ,",
    "there are four different types of a three - body system when we allow the neutron - neutron pair to be bound : _ borromean _",
    "( only virtual two - body subsystems ) , _ tango _ ( @xmath9 bound and @xmath10 virtual ) , _ samba _ ( @xmath9 virtual and @xmath10 bound ) and _ all - bound _ ( only bound two - body subsystems ) .",
    "the name _ samba _ was introduced to refer to a system quite stable because it has two bound two - body subsystem than the _ tango _ type , so it can  shake \" a little bit more and continue to be bound .",
    "the qualitative properties of the different possibilities of three - body systems are easily understood in terms of the effective attraction in the model : when a pair has a virtual state the effective interaction is weaker than when the pair is bound .",
    "thus , a three - body system has to shrink to keep the binding energy unchanged if a pair which is bound turns to be virtual .",
    "we have illustrated through several examples this property , which show that dimensionless sizes @xmath136 and @xmath137 increase from _ borromean _ , _ tango _ , _ samba _ and to _ all - bound _",
    "of course the size is expected to increase beyond limits when a nonvanishing three - body energy hits a scattering threshold , with the _ borromean _ configuration being the only exception . in spite of that , we conclude that even far from the threshold situation , the configuration sizes increase as we pointed out .",
