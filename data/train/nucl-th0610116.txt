    "in ordinary matter on the earth , atomic nuclei are roughly spherical .",
    "this fact can be understood in the liquid drop picture of the nucleus as being a result of the surface tension of nuclear matter , which favors a spherical nucleus , being greater than the coulomb repulsion between protons , which tends to make the nucleus deform . however , in supernova cores and neutron stars , the situation changes completely ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : when the density of matter approaches that of atomic nuclei , i.e. , the normal nuclear density @xmath0 , nuclei are closely packed and the effect of the electrostatic energy becomes comparable to that of the surface energy .",
    "consequently , around a density @xmath1 , the energetically favorable configuration could be rod - like or slab - like nuclei embedded in the gas phase , or rod - like or spherical bubbles of the gas phase embedded in nuclear matter @xcite",
    ". such phases with exotic shapes of nuclei are referred to as nuclear `` pasta '' phases .",
    "properties of the pasta phases in equilibrium states have been investigated by many authors so far @xcite .",
    "these earlier works have confirmed that , for various nuclear models , the nuclear shape changes in the sequence sphere , cylinder , slab , cylindrical hole , spherical hole , uniform with increasing density .",
    "this conclusion holds for the case of non - zero temperatures with a constant entropy @xcite as well as for the zero temperature case .",
    "however , in these works ( except for ref .",
    "@xcite ) they took account of only several specific nuclear shapes and determined the energetically favorable one by calculating the energy for these assumed structures within a liquid drop model or the thomas - fermi approximation . thus the phase diagram at subnuclear densities and the existence of the pasta phases should be examined without assuming the nuclear shape .",
    "it is also noted that at typical temperatures of the collapsing cores , several mev , effects of thermal fluctuations on the nucleon distribution are significant .",
    "however , these thermal fluctuations can not be described properly by mean - field theories such as the thomas - fermi and the hartree - fock approximations .    in the processes of supernova explosion and succeeding neutron star formation",
    ", the pasta phases can be formed in two stages . during the gravitational collapse ,",
    "matter in the collapsing core is compressed and the central region starts to solidify into a bcc lattice because the coulomb repulsion among nuclei gets stronger . in the later stage of the collapse , the central density reaches @xmath0 and the pasta phases could be formed from the bcc lattice due to the compression . after a bounce of",
    "the core takes place , the temperature of the core increases to @xmath2 mev and nuclei melt completely . as the cooling process of the protoneutron star proceeds later on , the pasta phases as well as normal spherical nuclei could be produced again from hot uniform nuclear matter at subnuclear densities .    the previous studies , which are based on a comparison of the energy with an assumption of the nuclear shape , cannnot answer whether or not the pasta phases can be formed dynamically within the time scale of the neutron star cooling nor whether or not the transitions between them , which is accompanied by drastic changes of nuclear shape , can be realized under nonequilibrium conditions in the collapsing cores . to solve these problems , molecular dynamic methods for nucleon many - body systems are suitable .",
    "they treat the motion of the nucleonic degrees of freedom and can describe thermal fluctuations and many - body correlations beyond the mean - field level .",
    "using one of the molecular dynamic methods , the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , we have arrived at the two following major conclusions @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) the pasta phases are formed from hot uniform nuclear matter by cooling it down within a time scale of @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "this supports the idea that the pasta phases exist in neutron star crusts .",
    "( 2 ) the transition from rod - like nuclei to slab - like nuclei and that from slab - like nuclei to rod - like bubbles can be realized by compression of matter .",
    "this suggests that the pasta phases could be formed in collapsing cores .    throughout the present article",
    ", we set the boltzmann constant @xmath5 .",
    "among various versions of the molecular dynamic models , qmd @xcite is the most practical and suitable for studying the pasta phases .",
    "this method is so efficient that we can describe rod - like and slab - like nuclei in terms of nucleon degrees of freedom even though they consist of macroscopic number of nucleons .",
    "in addition , we focus on the pasta structure and the configuration of nuclei on a macroscopic scale , where the shell effects @xcite , which can not be described by qmd , may be less important ( in the case of supernova matter , shell effects are always small ) .",
    "thus qmd is a good approximation for our present problem .      in our studies",
    ", we use a nuclear force given by a qmd model hamiltonian with the medium - equation - of - state parameter set in ref .",
    "this hamiltonian contains the momentum - dependent `` pauli potential '' to reproduce the effects of the pauli principle phenomenologically .",
    "the pauli potential generates repulsive forces between two identical particles close together in phase space .",
    "parameters in the pauli potential are determined by fitting the kinetic energy of the free fermi gas at zero temperature .",
    "this hamiltonian reproduces the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter , 16 mev per nucleon , at the normal nuclear density @xmath6 @xmath7 and other saturation properties : the incompressibility is set to be 280 mev and the symmetry energy is 34.6 mev @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian also well reproduces the properties of stable nuclei relevant for the situations we consider : the binding energy ( except for light nuclei from @xmath8c to @xmath9ne ) @xcite , and the rms radius of the ground state of heavy nuclei with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is also confirmed that another qmd hamiltonian close to this model provides a good description of nuclear reactions including the low energy region ( several mev per nucleon ) @xcite , which is one of the essential elements when one studies the dynamical processes as in sect .",
    "iii-2 .",
    "the coulomb interaction is one of the essential elements for the pasta phases .",
    "one must carefully treat the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction since electron screening is negligibly small in this system @xcite .",
    "a key quantity in determining the importance of electron screening is the ratio of the scale of the inhomogeneity , typically half the internuclear spacing @xmath11 , to the thomas - fermi screening length @xmath12^{-1/2 } = \\sqrt{\\pi/4\\pi}(k_e^{(0)})^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the averaged electron number density and chemical potential , respectively , and @xmath15 is the electron fermi wave vector .",
    "we note that , in the density region of the pasta phases , @xmath16 @xcite , which means that it is a good approximation to assume that the electron density distribution is uniform and neglect the screening effect ; but one must take account of the long - range nature of the coulomb force by , e.g. , the ewald summation procedure @xcite .",
    "it is fortunate that the screening effect is small ; otherwise one has to solve equations of motion for the electronic degrees of freedom together with that for the nucleonic ones because the coupling between these two components can not be neglected . thus introducing a screening length shorter than the actual value for calculating the coulomb force between protons keeping",
    "the density of electrons uniform is inconsistent .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the equilibrium state and discuss this point more quantitatively using a liquid drop model in the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "the energy density of a relativistic degenerate electron gas with an inhomogeneous density distribution @xmath17 is given by @xmath18\\equiv e_e^{(0)}(n_e^{(0)})+\\delta e_e \\simeq e_e^{(0)}(n_e^{(0)})[1+(2/9v_{\\rm c } ) \\int_{\\rm cell}d^3r\\ ( \\delta n_e({\\bf r})/n_e^{(0)})^2]$ ] , with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the volume of the wigner - seitz cell .",
    "if the screening effect is significant , the coulomb energy among protons decreases , but on the other hand , the @xmath21 term can not be neglected .",
    "calculations assuming a small @xmath22 and uniform @xmath23 artificially underestimate the coulomb energy among protons but discard the significant contribution of @xmath24 .",
    "now we estimate @xmath24 for an unrealistically small value of @xmath22 .",
    "we take the phase with spherical nuclei in the density region where the pasta phases start to appear , i.e. , the volume fraction of nuclei is @xmath25 according to the condition of the fission instability of spherical nuclei @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the radii of nuclei and the wigner - seitz cell , respectively .",
    "taking supernova matter for simplicity , in which the density of dripped neutrons is negligible , with the nucleon density in nuclei @xmath28 @xmath7 , proton fraction in nuclei @xmath29 , @xmath30 fm , and @xmath31 fm , and using expressions in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath24 per nucleon , @xmath32 , is estimated as @xmath33 mev would be larger than this value . ] for @xmath34 fm ( this value is adopted in ref .",
    "note that this is much larger than the energy difference between different pasta phases in the same density region in supernova matter , @xmath2 kev per nucleon .",
    "in the present section , let us review our previous works @xcite . in our qmd simulations , we treated a system which consists of neutrons , protons , and electrons in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the system is not magnetically polarized , i.e. , it contains equal numbers of protons ( and neutrons ) with spin up and spin down .",
    "the relativistic degenerate electrons which ensure charge neutrality are regarded as a uniform background @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction is calculated by the ewald method taking account of the gaussian charge distribution of the proton wave packets .      in refs .",
    "@xcite , we showed that the pasta phases are produced from hot uniform nuclear matter by cooling it down and we studied phase diagrams at zero and non - zero temperatures . in these works , we first prepared a uniform hot nucleon gas at a temperature @xmath35 mev .",
    "we then cooled it down slowly until the temperature got @xmath36 mev or less for @xmath37 @xmath4 , keeping the nucleon number density constant .",
    "note that this cooling time scale is much larger than the time scale @xmath38 for relaxation of the system , which is estimated as @xmath39 ( length scale of the inhomogeneity)@xmath40(sound velocity ) @xmath41 @xmath4 . in the cooling process",
    ", we mainly used the frictional relaxation method , which is given by the qmd equations of motion plus small friction terms : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the qmd hamiltonian , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the position and momentum of nucleon @xmath47 , respectively , and @xmath48 are the frictional coefficients .",
    "the resulting nucleon distributions of cold matter at @xmath49 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig pasta sym ] .",
    "we see from these figures that the phases with rod - like and slab - like nuclei , cylindrical and spherical bubbles , in addition to the phase with spherical nuclei are reproduced .",
    "the above simulations show that the pasta phases can be formed dynamically from hot uniform matter within a time scale @xmath3 @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "[ snap 0.225rho x0.5 16000 ] , we show snapshots of the nucleon distributions for @xmath50 at @xmath51 and 3 mev .",
    "this density corresponds to the phase with rod - like nuclei at @xmath52 .",
    "we have observed the following qualitative features : at @xmath53 mev the number of evaporated nucleons becomes significant ; at @xmath54 mev , nuclei almost melt and the nuclear surface is hard to identify .    the phase diagram for @xmath49 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ phase diagram x0.5 ] .",
    "the critical temperature of this model is @xmath55 mev . in the region below the dotted lines at @xmath56 mev ,",
    "where we can identify the nuclear surface , we have obtained the pasta phases in the same sequence as in the earlier works : from lower densities , spherical nuclei [ region ( a ) ] , rod - like nuclei [ region ( b ) ] , slab - like nuclei [ region ( d ) ] , cylindrical holes [ region ( f ) ] , and spherical holes [ region ( g ) ] .",
    "in addition to these pasta phases , structures with multiply connected nuclear and bubble regions ( i.e. , sponge - like structure ) such as branching rod - like nuclei , perforated slabs and branching bubbles , etc . , have been obtained in the regions ( c ) and ( e ) .",
    "further study using a larger system is necessary to conclude the existence of these sponge - like phases ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated the second point mentioned at the beginning of this article .",
    "we performed qmd simulations of the compression of dense matter and observed the transitions from rod - like nuclei to slab - like ones and from slab - like nuclei to rod - like bubbles .",
    "the initial conditions of the simulations are samples of the phase with rod - like nuclei ( @xmath57 ) and of the phase with slab - like nuclei ( @xmath58 ) with 16384 nucleons at @xmath49 and @xmath59 mev .",
    "we adiabatically compressed these samples by increasing the density to the value corresponding to the next pasta phase taking @xmath60 @xmath4 .",
    "this time scale is much larger than the typical time scale of the deformation and structural transition of nuclei ( e.g. , that of nuclear fission is @xmath61 @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , the compression in the simulations is adiabatic with respect to the change of the nuclear structure , so that the dynamics of the structural transition of nuclei observed in the simulations is physically meaningful , and is essentially independent of the compression rate , etc .    the resulting time evolution of the nucleon distribution is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig rod slab ] and [ fig slab cylindhole ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig rod slab ] , we see that the phase with slab - like nuclei is finally formed [ fig .  [ fig rod slab]-(6 ) ] from the phase with rod - like nuclei [ fig .  [ fig rod slab]-(1 ) ] .",
    "we note that the transition is triggered by thermal fluctuations , not by the fission instability : when the internuclear spacing becomes small enough and once some pair of neighboring rod - like nuclei touch due to the thermal fluctuations , they fuse [ figs .",
    "[ fig rod slab]-(2 ) and [ fig rod slab]-(3 ) ] .",
    "then such connected pairs of rod - like nuclei further touch and fuse with neighboring nuclei in the same lattice plane like a chain reaction [ fig .",
    "[ fig rod slab]-(4 ) ] ; the time scale of the each fusion process is @xmath62 @xmath4 .    the transition from the phase with slab - like nuclei to the phase with cylindrical holes is shown in fig .  [ fig slab cylindhole ] .",
    "when the internuclear spacing decreases enough , neighboring slab - like nuclei touch due to the thermal fluctuation as in the above case .",
    "once nuclei begin to touch [ fig .",
    "[ fig slab cylindhole]-(2 ) ] , bridges between the slabs are formed at many places on a time scale of @xmath62 @xmath4 . initially , the bridges cross the slabs almost orthogonally [ fig .",
    "[ fig slab cylindhole]-(3 ) ] .",
    "nucleons in the slabs continuously flow into the bridges and the bridges become wider and merge together to form cylindrical holes .",
    "then the cylindrical holes finally relax into a triangular lattice [ fig .",
    "[ fig slab cylindhole]-(6 ) ] .",
    "using qmd , we have shown the following two things : formation of the pasta phases in neutron star crusts by cooling and formation of rod - like bubbles from slab - like nuclei and that of slab - like nuclei from rod - like ones in supernova cores by compression of matter . in closing , we list important issues to be clarified in the future .",
    "* formation of the pasta phases by compression @xcite + a remaining problem is a transition from a bcc lattice of spherical nuclei to a triangular lattice of rod - like nuclei induced by compression .",
    "if this process is confirmed , existence of the pasta phases in supernova cores will be almost established . *",
