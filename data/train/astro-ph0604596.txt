    "a phase - referencing technique allows very - long - baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) to make relative astrometry with an accuracy of less than 1  milli - arcsecond  ( mas ) and to detect very weak sources in mjy level .",
    "the quality of phase referencing is limited by residual errors in differential phases between a target and a calibrator ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the most important error component is the uncertainty of atmospheric models in correlators .",
    "the differential excess - path length between the two sources at different elevations is significantly harmful , even with a zenith phase - delay error of only a few centimeters and a separation of sources only one degree .",
    "possible solutions are ( 1 )  estimating the unknown phase - delay at zenith , ( 2 )  to determine the residual phase gradient in the sky , and ( 3 )  using a calibrator very close to a target .",
    "it is advisable to apply all these solutions simultaneously .",
    "the first solution can be achieved by geodetic - like observations or by parallel plate air modeling of the long - term phase drifts @xcite .",
    "the data processing of the geodetic - like observations is supported by the task delzn of the astronomical image processing system  ( aips ; @xcite ) , developed at the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "the second solution can be achieved by using several strong calibrators over several degrees ; this calibration process is also supported by the task atmca in the aips .",
    "the third solution , using a calibrator very close to a target , depends on a matter of blind chance",
    ". however , it is promising if array s sensitivity is significantly improved , since the surface number density of radio sources dramatically increases in the fainter sky  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper proposes a bigradient phase - referencing ( bpr ) method , which gives us a chance to utilize such weak radio sources as calibrators .",
    "once a weak source very close to a target is detected by phase - referencing using a strong calibrator , and then plays a role as a calibrator for phase - referencing to detect a very weak target .",
    "such a two - step approach is responsible for its name .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the residual phase components are linear around the target  , array s focus on the weak calibrator can relocate to a point much closer to the target .",
    "hence , the bpr leads to be nearly free from the long - term phase drifts .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present the bpr method and its observational tests . in section  [ section :",
    "principle ] we describe the principle of the method and predict final phase errors . in section  [ section : testobs ]",
    "we report demonstrative vlbi observations . in section  [ section : discussion ] we discuss the capability of this method .",
    "finally , we summarize the method and the test observations in section  [ section : summary ] .",
    "the bpr method schedules three sources : a target ` t ' , a primary calibrator ` c1 ' , and a secondary calibrator ` c2 ' .",
    "c1 is bright enough to detect in half of a coherence time , typically a few minutes or less , depending on observing frequency and weather condition @xcite .",
    "we assume here c2 provides correlated flux densities insufficient for fringe detection in half of the coherence time but sufficient for detection by phase - referencing of several tens of minutes : it is @xmath110  mjy at centimeter bands for typical vlbi arrays . on the basis of statistical discussion on the surface - number density of radio sources in the sky ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "c1 may be located relatively far from t , typically @xmath12  deg separation , while c2 can be found at the position significantly closer to t , possibly @xmath20.5  deg separation .",
    "an example of source configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sourceconfig ] .    ( 80mm,160mm)fig1.eps    both t and c2 should be observed using phase - referencing because of their weakness .",
    "an example of schedule for the bpr is as follows : @xmath3 it consists of sets of fast - switching for two pairs : c2c1 and t  c1 . the schedule intends to remove rapid phase fluctuations by fast - switching , and to change the reference point c1 into c2 by pair - swapping in order to reduce the separation angle from t. the scans for the c2c1 pair must be allocated every less than 1  hour , so that the long - term phase drifts can be tracked .",
    "the number of iterations of fast - switching for the c2c1 pair should be set to secure the detection of c2 with a signal - to - noise ratio of more than 5 , for successful self - calibration in phase domain .",
    "with such an observing schedule , an observer will obtain raw visibility data for the target and two calibrators .",
    "after determination of amplitude - gain , delay and delay - rate solutions using c1 , all we have to consider is phase terms",
    ". observed , raw visibility phases , @xmath4 , involve various phase terms .",
    "@xmath5 where , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are phase terms for c1 , c2 and t , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is a phase term originating in source structure ; @xmath10 is a positional - phase delay relative to a phase - tracking center ; @xmath11 is an instrumental - phase delay ; @xmath12 is a geometric - phase delay error ; @xmath13 is tropospheric / ionospheric - phase delay error ; @xmath14 is a rapidly variable phase due to water vapor flowing at low altitude .",
    "we ignore thermal phase noise and calibration errors in the present paper .",
    "we deal with the phase terms of source position and structure separately , in order to show an astrometric term and its error expressly at the last equation .",
    "time scales of the change of these phase - error components are usually more than several tens of minutes , except for @xmath14 in which the time scale is typically a few minutes or less .

    "this was measured by two - dimensional gaussian fitting using task jmfit of aips .      in the bpr method ,",
    "phase - referenced visibilities of c2 are supposed to be coherent in at least several tens of minutes .",
    "additionally , the more - sophisticated calibration expects that the phase of phase - referenced c2 is a linear extrapolation of the phase - drift between t and c1 .",
    "we show an example of phase - referenced visibility phases both of 3c  345  ( t ) and nrao  512  ( c2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : vplot ] . a long - term phase - drift is seen .",
    "the phase - drift of 3c  345 was undesirable for normal phase - referencing .",
    "from da  426 s  ( c1 s ) point of view , both the two sources are at about the same direction and separation .",
    "the phases of nrao  512 are supposed to be similar to the drift of 3c  345 , and this expectation met the obserevation .",
    "consequently , we can remove a large part of the phase drift on 3c  345 by shifting array s focus to nrao  512 .",
    "the phase drift of nrao  512 became larger than that of 3c  345 especially later than 09h , where elevations of these sources became lower .",
    "this deviation occurred because that the separation angle of nrao  512da  426 was larger than that of 3c  345da  426 .",
    "consequently , the data of 3c  345 will be over - corrected by the solution table  2 in the bpr .",
    "the more - sophisticated calibration aims to correct such a difference by optimizing the solution table  2 toward the hypothetical calibrator c2@xmath16 .",
    "the rms of calibrated phases are listed in column  ( 7 ) of table  [ table : result ] .",
    "steady improvements were seen in the images from the 2nd epoch data from all the antennas .",
    "however , slightly increases of rms were seen in vera data .",
    "it may be a coincidental effect of the intrinsic structure of 3c  345 ; the vera array is sensitive to source structure because of its longest baselines in the jvn array .",
    "the improvements of the other parameters  ( e.g. , peak intensity ) are the proof of efficacy of more - sophisticated calibration .",
    "( 160mm,160mm)fig3.eps      we evaluate here an astrometric capability from positional reproducibility between the two epochs .",
    "because of only a month , intrinsic changes of source structures were presumably negligible .",
    "the measured position offsets from the phase - tracking center on the target images are listed in column  ( 8) and ( 9 ) of table  [ table : result ] .",
    "the improvements of positional reproducibity by the bpr and more - sophisticated calibration are visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : positionshift ] .",
    "the position differences between the 1st epoch and 2nd epoch of the target with all the available antennas were steadily reduced in our calibration steps : 360@xmath0240  micro - arcsecond  ( @xmath17as ) between the normal phase - referenced images , 120@xmath057  @xmath17as between the bpr images , and finally , 62@xmath050",
    "@xmath17as between the images by more - sophisticated calibration .",
    "globally , the emission peak of 3c  345 appeared at @xmath18  mas northwest from the phase - tracking center .",
    "these global position shifts include several origins , which will be discussed in section  [ section : discussion_astrometry ] .",
    "the bpr substantially achieves phase - referencing between the c2t pair without fast - switching between them . in our tests ,",
    "3c  345 and nrao  512 were separated by 0.48  deg , 4.3-times smaller than the separation angle of actual fast - switching between 3c  345 and da  426 . a long - term phase drift from atmospheric / geometric errors , therefore , was expected to be 4.3-times smaller .",
    "however , resultant dynamic ranges of bpr images have been improved only 3.1 - 3.8 times better than those of normal phase - referenced images .",
    "this discrepancy was probably caused by several calibration errors ( section  [ section : calibrationerror ] ) .",
    "the phase drifts seem to be successfully tracked with the sampling of c2 every 40  minutes .",
    "however , this sampling frequency might be risky in some level , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vplot ] the phase of nrao  512 and 3c  345 are systematically different at about 9.2h  ut .",
    "it is advisable to pair - switch every about 20  minutes , or to apply an another observing schedule with more frequent c2 scans , such as @xmath19  .",
    "the observation case of indeed very weak c2 , which is originally supposed in the bpr , will be reported in a future paper .",
    "the bpr would give a better quality than that of the normal phase - referencing , even with a weak  ( @xmath110  mjy ) c2 with a signal - to - noise ratio of  5 in several scans using typical arrays at centimeter bands .",
    "we briefly discuss the over - correction of the solution table  2 in the bpr method , by comparison of 2nd epoch images with all the antennas . in the normal phase - referenced images both of 3c  345 and nrao  512 ( not shown ) ,",
    "very similar patterns of distorted contours are seen : positive and negative contours reside mainly at lower - right and upper - left side corners in the images , respectively  [ ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ] . on the other hand",
    ", an opposite trend appears in the contours of the bpr image of 3c  345  [ ( j ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ] .",
    "this is an effect of over - correction of solution table  2 , which was designed for 2.57-degree separation of the c1c2 pair rather than 2.09-degree separation of the c1t pair .",
    "the distortion trend almost disappears in the image by more - sophisticated calibration using the optimized table [ ( k ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ] .",
    "the bpr and the more - sophisticated calibration support relative astrometry , if observers use identical phase - tracking centers every epochs ( section  [ section : principle ] ) .",
    "the consistency of the measured positions between our two epochs ( section  [ section : positionshift ] ) indicated that relative astrometry presumably worked well .",
    "the position differences among the epochs are consistent with phase noises  ( table  [ table : result ] ) .",
    "dramatic revisions of the target position are seen particularly in declination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : positionshift ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the long - term phase drifts were responsible for a large part of the declination offsets .",
    "geometric errors should be small in the vera s four telescopes , kashima34 m , and tsukuba32 m , whose coordinates are strictly maintained by geodetic observations .",
    "the correlator model in the mitaka fx correlator seems to have somewhat prediction errors in zenith excess - path lengths at troposphere and/or ionosphere .",
    "note that a - priori calibration for such atmospheric errors is usually performed in the vera project .",
    "there remain significant offsets @xmath18  mas west and @xmath20  @xmath17as north in both the epochs , even with the more - sophisticated calibration .",
    "since such large global offsets could not be caused by any atmospheric / geometric errors in principle , an accumulation of intrinsic differences between actual emission s positions and phase - tracking centers of the target and two calibrators should be mainly responsible for the global offsets .",
    "this kind of offsets can not be avoided even with the icrf radio sources and their cataloged positions , which have uncertainties of @xmath21  mas @xcite , not only in the bpr and the more - sophisticated calibration but also in the normal phase - referencing .",
    "da  426  ( c1 ) has mas - scale jets east - southeast ;",
    "3c  345  ( t ) has mas - scale jets west - northwest .",
    "hence , the global offsets pointing toward west - northwest may be reasonable .",
    "a position difference of 62@xmath050  @xmath17as between the two epochs in the images by more - sophisticated calibration might originate in the slightly misaligned allocation of the three sources .",
    "strictly , the optimized solution table  2 reacted to the sky position of c2@xmath16 .",
    "this position was separated by 2.1  arcmin from t. the atmospheric and geometric errors from this separation could cause a @xmath22 - 20  @xmath17as difference between the two epochs .",
    "if the three sources perfectly aligned , the apparent positions of two epochs might coincide with each other within an error bar .",
    "although both the bpr and the more - sophisticated calibration aim to retaliate against long - term phase drifts by reducing a separation angle , they are based on slightly different tactics .",
    "the bpr makes a weak source play a role of calibrator  c2 .",
    "since self - calibration is done on c2 , array s focus shifts to c2 , closer to t than c1 .",
    "the more - sophisticated calibration estimates the solution of self - calibration on a hypothetical calibrator  c2@xmath16 from the solution on c2 .",
    "array s focus finally shifts to c2@xmath16 , closer to t than c2 .",
    "the key of the bpr is the presence of suitable c2 at a position less half the distance to t than that to c1 .",
    "without such a suitable c2 , a bpr image will be worse than that of normal phase referencing .",
    "however , even a distant c2 may help the more - sophisticated calibration , if the sources align straightly .",
    "the key of the more - sophisticated calibration is the linearity of the phases @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the linearity around sources have been already assumed in the method of atmca , which uses strong calibrators around a target to determine the phase gradient .",
    "the best performance can be obtained by both the more - sophisticated calibration and the atmca when sources align straightly . even in case of misaligned source allocation",
    ", the calibration of atmca can be done by estimation of a two - dimensional phase gradient using three or more calibrators .",
    "because of the same assumption , the more - sophisticated calibration also can do it .",
    "array s focus can be established exactly at t , when @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "such a calibration table is derived from the two solution tables produced by self - calibrations on c2 and c3 , in addition to that on c1 .",
    "not only bright calibrators but also weak ones are usable as secondary calibrators , when the bpr is applied before the more - sophisticated calibration or the atmca . alternatively , with only one secondary calibrator",
    ", a good calibration can be achieved if assuming that the phase gradient is in elevation direction because the residual phase error is mostly tropospheric origin .",
    "this is supported by an option of the atmca .",
    "in such a process , observers should separate @xmath23 from the other terms that would interact with the determination of the phase gradient .",
    "recommend observing for more than 3  hours to find the true positions of calibrators , in order to make @xmath29 .",
    "the term @xmath24 , however , would be harmful in arrays with poorly position - determined spacecraft and/or antennas .",
    "( 80mm,160mm)fig4color.eps    the bpr can make very weak sources available as calibrators . in normal",
    "phase - referencing a signal - to - noise ratio of more than @xmath15 in half of a fast - switching period is required to obtain phase , delay , delay - rate solutions , while in the bpr a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath15 to obtain only a phase solution in about a quarter of a pair - swapping period is acceptable .",
    "this means that we can actually use calibrators more than a  few times weaker than conventional calibrators .",
    "consequently , the bpr brings lots of benefits , for example : ( 1 )  observers will be given more opportunities to make phase - referencing successfully at short centimeter and millimeter bands ( @xmath12286  ghz ) , where targets normally have little chance of being accompanied by bright calibrators with a small separation angle .",
    "( 2 )  phase - referencing is available even to poorly sensitive or poorly position - determined antennas such as a space - vlbi .",
    "( 3 )  astrometry can be made between two weak sources , one of which has been self - calibrated .",
    "( 4 )  observers can easily obtain idealized calibrator arrangements on the sky plane for the subsequent more - sophisticated calibration or the atmca , because of much larger surface number density in the faint - source sky .",
    "practically , prior phase - referencing observations will be needed to find suitable calibrators around the target .",
    "we suggest that candidates are selected from flat - spectrum sources in the catalogs of the first survey and so on , like an approach of ` a vlba survey of flat - spectrum first sources  @xcite . '",
    "the bpr and the subsequent more - sophisticated calibration are universal - designed .",
    "there is no requirement of upgrades for hardware or software .",
    "all observers have to do is scheduling of fast - switching with less frequent pair - swapping , and data reduction with bigradient calibration processes , which can be done only with the aips and editting solution tables .",
    "even with antennas whose positions have not been well - determined , or even with a correlator without precise atmospheric models , very weak targets can be detected because of a much smaller separation from c2 or c2@xmath16 than that from c1 .",
    "a - priori calibration by geodetic - like observations ( e.g. , ) should bring independent improvements .",
    "therefore , the combination of such prior calibrations and our method should achieve extremely high - quality phase - referencing .",
    "the bigradient phase referencing  ( bpr ) allows us to utilize weak calibrators , one of which may be located at a position very closer to a target .",
    "the subsequent more - sophisticated calibration makes array s focus to shift to a hypothetical point much closer to a target .",
    "thanks to much smaller separation angle , the phase - referencing quality of a target image will be dramatically improved .",
    "we describe the theory of the method and expected errors . for relative astrometry",
    ", observer must use identical phase - tracking centers every epoch and the first self - calibrations on the calibrators using the structure models at the phase - tracking centers .",
    "our demonstrative observation tests with strong sources  ( 3c  345 , nrao  512 , and da  426 ) have shown its capabilities .",
    "image dynamic ranges have been dramatically improved by a factor of about six , compared to normal phase - referencing .",
    "an astrometric reproducibility is 62@xmath050  @xmath17as between our two epochs in the most calibrated cases .",
    "the observation case of a weak calibrator , which is originally supposed in the bpr , will be reported in a future paper .",
