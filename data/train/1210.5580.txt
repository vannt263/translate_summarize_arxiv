    "in a recent paper , jonathan sondow introduced the parbelos - a parabolic analogue of the arbelos @xcite .",
    "one of the beautiful properties of the parbelos is that the tangents at the cusps of the parbelos form a rectangle , and that the diagonal of the rectangle opposite the cusp is tangent to the upper parabola .",
    "moreover , the tangency point lies on the bisector of the angle at the cusp .",
    "sondow asks for a synthetic proof of these two properties of the tangent rectangle of the parbelos , which he proves by analytic means . in this paper , we present such a proof .",
    "we do so by introducing a converse to the following theorem of lambert : the circumcircle of a triangle formed by three tangent lines to the parabola passes through the focus of the parabola . in the process of proving sondow s tangent property",

    "sondow s tangency property : the diagonal @xmath0 of the tangent rectangle @xmath1 is tangent to the outer parabola .",
    "moreover , the tangency point is the intersection of the angle bisector of cusp @xmath2 with the outer parabola . ]",
    "the classical simson - wallace theorem is a useful tool in understanding the parabola .",

    "a pedal curve is defined as the locus of orthogonal projections of a point into the tangents of the curve . in a sense discussed in @xcite",
    ", the parabola may be viewed as a polygon with infinitely many vertices which satisfies the following simson - type property : it is the unique curve such that its pedal curve with respect to a point is a line .",
    "the point turns out to be the focus @xmath5 of the parabola and the line is the supporting line at its vertex , which we will denote by @xmath6 .",
    "[ thm : tangent to parabola iff relates to supporting line]a line @xmath7 is tangent to the parabola if and only if the orthogonal projection of the focus @xmath5 into @xmath7 lies on the supporting line @xmath6 .    for a proof of the `` only if '' statement",

    "since @xmath6 has no points inside of the parabola , there exists a tangent line @xmath11 to @xmath9 not equal to @xmath6 which passes through @xmath4 .",

    "]    lambert s theorem on the parabola states that the circumcircle of a triangle formed by three tangents to the parabola always passes through the focus . using theorem [ thm : tangent to parabola iff relates to supporting line ]",
    ", we can prove the statement quite easily .",
    "let three trangents @xmath13 to the parabola be given .",
    "then the orthogonal projections of @xmath5 into @xmath13 all lie on @xmath6 , and are therefore collinear . by the simson - wallace theorem , @xmath5 lies on the circumcircle of the triangle formed from @xmath13 .",

    "[ thm : lambert converse](converse to lambert s theorem ) let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be two distinct lines tangent to a parabola @xmath9 with focus @xmath5 .",

    "let @xmath19 , for @xmath20 with at least one @xmath21 .",
    "then the line @xmath22 is tangent to @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath23 for some @xmath24 , then the statement clearly holds .",
    "so assume that @xmath21 for each @xmath24 . by theorem [ thm : tangent to parabola",

    "is uniquely determined by two points , this line must be @xmath6 .",
    "applying theorem [ thm : tangent to parabola iff relates to supporting line ] again yields that @xmath22 is tangent to @xmath9 .    .",
    "recall that the latus rectum of a conic is the chord through the focus parallel to the conic s directrix .",
    "the parbelos is constructed as follows .",
    "given three points @xmath26 on a line , construct parabolas @xmath27 that open in the same direction and whose latera recta are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the parbelos is defined as the region bounded by the three latus rectum arcs .        the tangent line of a parabola at either endpoint of its latus rectum forms an angle of @xmath31 with the latus rectum . as such",

    "one can extend these four tangents to form a rectangle whose vertices are the intersections of tangent lines as in figure [ fig : sondows - tangency - property : ] .",
    "we will denote the vertices of this rectangle by @xmath37 .",

    ", it is easy to see that @xmath39 must be a square and its center @xmath43 is the same as that of @xmath44 .",
    "since its center is @xmath43 , by symmetry it intersects @xmath30 at a point @xmath5 , such that @xmath5 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath45 down to @xmath30 .",
    "this point is the focus of the outer parabola .",
    "since @xmath46 lie on a circle , theorem [ thm : lambert converse ] implies that @xmath0 is tangent to the parabola .    as for the angle bisector at the cusp @xmath2",
    ", the billiard angle property implies that it is orthogonal to @xmath30 ( see figure [ fig : angle bisector in billiard square ] ) .",

    "we would like to see that @xmath48 .",
    "one way to look at the configuration in figure [ fig : billiard table ] is as a @xmath51-periodic billiard trajectory in a square billiard table ( for an exposition on billiards in polygons , see @xcite )",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether there is a deeper connection between ( p)arbelos and billiards .",

    "notice that the vertical sides of the rectangle @xmath39 are the axes of symmetry of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , while the horizontal sides are @xmath56 and the directrix of the outer parabola .",
