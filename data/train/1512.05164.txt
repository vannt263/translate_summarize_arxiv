    "there is great interest in understanding properties of simplicial complexes which are embeddable in a certain euclidean space .",
    "the basic case is 1-dimensional complexes that are embeddable in the plane , i.e. , graphs that can be drawn on the plane without crossings between the edges .",
    "planar graphs are very well understood , for instance , it is easily shown that if a planar graph has @xmath3 vertices it has at most @xmath6 edges .",
    "however , roughly speaking , how `` dense '' a simplicial @xmath0-complex embeddable in @xmath7 can be , is less understood for arbitrary @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we show certain properties of embeddable complexes that , for instance , can be used to give an upper bound for this density problem .",
    "the property we mentioned involves the notion of the link - complex of a vertex and linking of spheres in euclidean spaces ( and more generally of algebraic cycles ) .",
    "we begin by considering the simplest ( but perhaps the hardest ) case @xmath8 .",
    "we consider first 2-complexes in @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a @xmath11-complex .",
    "the link - complex of a vertex is the maximal @xmath12-subcomplex ( a graph ) whose join with the vertex is a subcomplex of @xmath10 ( we give definitions in later sections ) .",
    "sometimes the embeddability property of the complex provides restrictions on possible link - graphs .",
    "the following is well - known , see @xcite .",
    "assume that the complex @xmath10 is sitting in @xmath9 , i.e. , simplex - wise linearly embedded .",
    "then , if we consider small enough balls around each vertex , we can observe that the intersection of the boundary of a ball with the complex @xmath10 is a drawing of the link - graph of the vertex on the @xmath11-sphere . now a planar graph with @xmath3 vertices has at most @xmath6 edges , hence the total number of edges in all link - graphs is at most @xmath13 .",
    "since each triangle is counted three times it follows that such a complex @xmath10 over @xmath3 vertices has at most @xmath14 triangles .",
    "a complex embedded in @xmath9 and @xmath15 triangles can be constructed by putting @xmath3 vertices on each of two skew lines in 3-space and then taking the delaunay triangulation of the point set ; it will consist of @xmath15 tetrahedra .",
    "alternatively , one can take the boundary of the @xmath16-dimensional cyclic polytope , remove a single facet and embed it in @xmath9 .",
    "if we know that @xmath10 embeds in @xmath17 , in general no restriction is imposed on the link - graph of a vertex . to see this ,",
    "take an arbitrary graph in some @xmath18 and `` cone '' this graph from a vertex on one side of the @xmath19-plane .",
    "hence , arbitrary graphs appear as link - complexes of embeddable @xmath11-complexes .",
    "we can add another vertex on the other side of the 3-plane and cone again .",
    "thus the intersection of two link - graphs can be an arbitrary graph .",
    "however , there are global restrictions on the set of all link - complexes and the above process can not be continued . in words , we show that in a pl embeddable @xmath11-complex , for any triple of distinct link - graphs , their common intersection ( or a triple intersection ) has to be a linklessly embeddable graph .",
    "informally , a linklessly embeddable graph is one that can be `` drawn '' in space without links between disjoint circles .",
    "figure [ fig : linking ] shows some examples of links in euclidean spaces between spheres of the right dimensions .",
    "an interesting property of our main observation is that the same proof works for all dimensions .",
    "that is , we show that for any pl embeddable @xmath0-complex , each triple intersection of link - complexes is a linklessly embeddable @xmath20-complex ( in @xmath21 ) . as an consequence , in a planar graph , triple intersections of link - complexes ( subsets of vertices ) have at most three vertices .",
    "this is because four points on a real - line always allow a link between two 0-dimensional spheres .",
    "obviously , in this case the graph would contain a @xmath22 otherwise , and hence would be non - planar . of course this",
    "bound is not tight since we know that the triple intersections has at most two points .",
    "however , this example shows the application of the results of this article to the case @xmath23 . in the case",
    "@xmath8 a stronger fact is true that a triple intersection of links is actually a planar graph .",
    "the proof of planarity in the case @xmath8 uses the characterization of planar graphs by forbidden minors , and so is not directly generalized into higher dimensions , see the last section for a discussion about planarity .",
    "these observations lead us to derive a new upper bound on the number of top simplices of embeddable @xmath0-complexes with @xmath3 vertices . for a simplicial complex @xmath10 ,",
    "let @xmath24 be the number of @xmath25-dimensional simplices of @xmath10",
    ". denote by @xmath26 the maximum number of @xmath0-simplices of an ( continuously ) embeddable @xmath0-complex with @xmath3 vertices in @xmath7 .",
    "the problem of determining or bounding @xmath26 is a major open problem .",
    "for the case of ( boundaries of simplicial ) convex polytopes , by the famous upper bound theorem , the @xmath27-vector is always bounded above by the @xmath27-vector of the cyclic polytope , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this result has been strengthened to include all homeomorphic complexes to a convex polytope , see @xcite .",
    "we note that deriving asymptotic tight bounds for all these cases is much easier by using the vanishing of the betti numbers and the euler relation . for instance , in the case @xmath8 , the euler relation states that @xmath28 in a simplicial complex . hence @xmath29 asymptotically is dominated by @xmath30 .",
    "it is conjectured by many that the same ( at least ) asymptotic bounds that is true for @xmath0-simplices in the upper bound theorem is also true for @xmath26 , this means @xmath31 .",
    "however , the best bound in the literature is @xmath32 , and this is the best known bound for all @xmath33 .",
    "this bound is proved by forbidding some non - embeddable subcomplexes , see @xcite or @xcite for a proof , and also @xcite for an application . in this paper , in theorem [",
    "theorem : main ] , we improve this bound to @xmath34 . we also show that the same bound is true for the number of @xmath0-simplices in @xmath0-complexes which can be linklessly embedded in @xmath35 .",
    "note that this latter result is strictly stronger than the former , since a complex that is embeddable in @xmath7 is linklessly embeddable in @xmath35 .",
    "there exist also bounds on these complexes by forbidding `` bad '' subcomplexes , see @xcite for instances of small non - linklessly embeddable complexes .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a ( suitably defined ) random @xmath0-complex embeddable in @xmath7 has asymptotically almost surely @xmath36 for some constant @xmath37 .",
    "so the conjecture is true for almost all complexes .",
    "the general belief is that the current upper bounds is far from the truth .",

    "in this section we use the theorems which restrict the triple intersections of links of vertices to derive an upper bound on the number of top simplices in a @xmath0-complex embeddable in @xmath7 .",
    "we consider first the @xmath11-complexes .",
    "for the purpose of bounding the number of triangles , we use the fact that triple intersections of link complexes are planar .",
    "it is well - known that a planar graph on @xmath3 vertices has at most @xmath211 edges .",
    "thus , for any embedded 2-complex @xmath10 in @xmath17 , any triple intersection of links of vertices has at most @xmath211 edges . from formula [ formula :",
    "faces ] and a basic combinatorial lemma proved in the next section , lemma [ lemma : comb ] , it follows that the total number of triangles satisfies @xmath212 .",
    "a similar result with slightly worse constant and for pl embeddings can be obtained using theorem [ theorem : basic ] .",
    "this is because the graph @xmath113 is not linklessly embeddable by the well known conway - gordon - sachs theorem .",
    "hence , any linklessly embeddable graph can not contain a subdivision of @xmath113 and by the extremal results of mader @xcite it has at most @xmath213 edges .",
    "next we consider @xmath0-complexes @xmath10 in @xmath1-space , @xmath214 . from the non - embeddebility result of grnbaum",
    "it follows that a triple intersection of three link - complexes can not include a complex @xmath215 $ ] .",
    "this is because non - embeddability of @xmath216*[3]$ ] ( into @xmath217 ) can be `` read from the right '' to imply that : in an embeddable complex , any triple intersection of link - complexes of vertices is such that any triple intersection of link - complexes of it do not include a homeomorphic image of @xmath218 as a subgraph .",
    "thus , by the above discussion , any triple intersection of links is a @xmath11-complex of size @xmath219 . by lemma [ lemma : comb ]",
    "the total number of @xmath0-simplices is @xmath220 .",
    "therefore we can state the following .",
    "[ theorem : main ] let @xmath26 be the maximum number of @xmath0 simplices of an @xmath3-vertex @xmath0-complex embeddable in @xmath7 , @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath221    for the case @xmath23 the above reduces to @xmath222 hence the classical bound on the number of edges of a planar graph .",
    "so we assume that @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath223 be the maximum number of @xmath0-simplices in an @xmath3-vertex @xmath0-complex that does not have a subcomplex homeomorphic to @xmath224 * \\cdots * [ 3]$ ] with @xmath225 factors of @xmath209 $ ] . by the results of grnbaum @xmath226",
    "and we bound @xmath223 . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the condition that complex does not contain a homeomorphic copy of @xmath224 $ ] implies that triple intersections of link - graphs are graphs that do not contain a subdivision of @xmath207 . by the early results of mader @xcite such graphs",
    "have @xmath227 edges .",
    "then , from lemma [ lemma : comb ] it follows that @xmath228 .",
    "now consider the case of general @xmath0 .",
    "the condition that a @xmath0-complex does not have a subcomplex homeomorphic to @xmath224 * \\cdots * [ 3]$ ] with @xmath225 factors of @xmath209 $ ] implies triple intersections of link complexes do not contain subcomplexes homeomorphic to @xmath224 * \\cdots * [ 3]$ ] with @xmath229 factors of @xmath209 $ ] .",
    "hence , triple intersections of link complexes are @xmath20-complexes over at most @xmath230 vertices whose number of @xmath20-simplices is bounded by @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , we can apply lemma [ lemma : comb ] again and we obtain    @xmath232    in the above @xmath103 is a constant coming from the combinatorial lemma and @xmath233 is the constant in the asymptotic bound for @xmath231 , so in general the constant in the notation depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the last equality follows by simple calculation .    [",
    "[ size - of - linklessly - embeddable - d - complexes - in - mathbb - r2d1 ] ] size of linklessly embeddable @xmath0-complexes in @xmath35 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    using the linklessness criterion of theorem [ lemma : basic ] one can prove in a way totally similar to the proof of theorem [ theorem : main ] a stronger result than theorem [ theorem : main ] for continuous embeddings .",
    "as noted in the remark above , by @xcite lemma 1 , if a @xmath0-complex embeds linklessly in @xmath35 then it can not contain a subcomplex homeomorphic to @xmath209 * \\cdots * [ 3]$ ] , @xmath234 factors . using an inductive argument as in the proof of theorem [ theorem : main ] , it follows that the same asymptotic bound proved above also applies to complexes that are linklessly embeddable in @xmath35 , with slightly different constants . in the argument ,",
    "@xmath207 is replaced by @xmath209 * [ 3]$ ] .",
    "hence , for the case @xmath8 one needs to bound the number of edges in graphs with no @xmath22 subdivision and for this purpose it is enough to consider graphs with no subdivision of @xmath113 as subgraph .",
    "note that here for @xmath33 the codimension is at least three and a continuous embedding can always be approximated by a pl one @xcite .",
    "let @xmath235 be the maximum number of @xmath0-simplices of an @xmath3-vertex @xmath0-complex linklessly embeddable in @xmath35 , @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath236    [ [ remark-1 ] ] remark + + + + + +    from the tightness of lemma [ lemma : comb ] it follows that the above bounds are also tight for the conditions we imposed on the link - complexes only .",
    "for instance in the case @xmath8 , it is enough to observe that from the set systems given by lemma [ lemma : comb ] one can build a simplicial complex whose link - complexes correspond to the sets @xmath237 .",
    "let @xmath238 be the number of vertices .",
    "take the set from the lemma with @xmath239 .",
    "then , simply take a graph over @xmath240 vertices , so that the elements of the set @xmath72 can be identified with edges .",
    "then one introduces a vertex for each set @xmath237 and cones over the corresponding set of edges .",
    "the resulting complex has the required properties , i.e , the triple intersections of link - complexes have at most @xmath238 edges and in total the complex contains @xmath241 triangles .",
    "this section gives the proof of a combinatorial lemma used in deriving the upper bounds .",
    "we produce it here for completeness . in this section",
    "we denote the number of elements of a set @xmath242 by @xmath243 .",
    "let @xmath244 be a finite set and @xmath245 a collection of subsets of @xmath72 .",
    "we are interested in bounding the quantity @xmath246 that is a function of @xmath3 and @xmath115 .",
    "the restriction on sets @xmath237 comes from their common intersections .",

    "let @xmath251 be the number of sets that the element @xmath252 belongs to .",
    "to prove the lemma , we bound the quantity @xmath253 in two ways .",
    "first , since there are @xmath254 summands with each having at most @xmath249 elements we have    @xmath255    let the variable @xmath256 when @xmath257 is in @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and zero otherwise .",
    "then , @xmath260 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath261 is the number of triples @xmath262 such that @xmath257 appears in @xmath258 .",
    "this number is @xmath263 .",
    "then we have    @xmath264    by the hoelder inequality    @xmath265    writing @xmath266 , the above becomes @xmath267 .",
    "we expand the left hand side of ( [ eq:2 ] ) : @xmath268    from above it follows that    @xmath269    therefore , @xmath270 and since @xmath271 we obtain @xmath272    we consider now set systems that can achieve the bounds of the lemma with parameters that are of interest to us , i.e. , @xmath273 .",
    "assume @xmath274 is such a system and for any distinct triple , @xmath258 has exactly @xmath27 elements .",
    "then , we can form another dual system as follows .",
    "let @xmath275 and define @xmath276 to be those sets @xmath277 that contain the element @xmath252 for @xmath278 .",
    "the the sets @xmath276 satisfy the following condition .",
    "each @xmath19-set of elements of @xmath279 appears in exactly @xmath27 sets @xmath276 .",

    "refer to @xcite for extensive account of these and other combinatorial designs .",
    "let @xmath281 be a positive integer .",
    "by definition , a steiner system @xmath282 is a set system @xmath283 over a set @xmath284 such that , each set ( or block ) has size from @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , every @xmath281-subset of @xmath285 appears in exactly @xmath190 blocks .",
    "it is clear from the above that any @xmath280 with @xmath3 blocks can be used to build @xmath115 sets of an @xmath3 element set such that each triple of them has exactly @xmath27 elements .",
    "also , `` approximate '' steiner systems are enough for our purposes , however , we are not aware of existence of steiner systems @xmath286 with roughly @xmath287 blocks such that @xmath115 and @xmath190 are also approximately @xmath238 .",
    "we have shown certain restrictions on intersections of link - complexes of vertices in embeddable simplicial complexes .",
    "there is an obvious direction to continue this research and that is to find more restrictions of the type introduced here .",
    "for instance , what `` global '' conditions are imposed on double intersections of link - complexes ?",
    "it is also natural to strengthen the linklessness criterion to @xmath288-planarity in our main observation for all @xmath33 .",
    "it can be done in addition to the case @xmath8 shown above , in dimensions @xmath289 , where the embeddability is characterized by the van kampen obstruction , i.e. , when @xmath290 .",
    "one shows that if a complex has van kampen obstruction nonzero , then its join by three vertices also has nonzero van kampen obstruction .",
    "hence , non - embeddable complexes in euclidean space of dimension @xmath290 can not be triple intersections of link - complexes of embeddable @xmath0-complexes in @xmath1-space . however , we are more interested to know if a proof exists that works for all dimensions and hence does not use the characterization of embeddable @xmath0-complexes in @xmath1-space , by forbidden minors or the van kampen class .",
