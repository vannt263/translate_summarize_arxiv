    "@xcite do not disprove the core of the wigner - pdc approach as developed in @xcite ; it only does so with some detection models proposed to be able to interpret the expressions in consistency with local - realism ( lr ) .",
    "precisely what we prove here is that such ( local - realist ) interpretation does not need to depart from qm at any step ( at least for the relevant subset of quantum mechanical states ) , a property that former proposals like @xcite did not satisfy ( not to mention other problems of their own ) .",
    "this said , neither is ours here the ultimate proof that everything in regard to the wigner - pdc approach works perfectly fine : well , i claim it is so , but so far only at the mathematical level .",
    "the one and only value of this work is to show that , even still in need to determine further choices both at the physical and purely mathematical levels , there is room to accommodate all necessary restrictions .",
    "once more , _ without any need to depart from quantum mechanical predictions , provided we stay inside the subset of qed - states compatible with lr_. it should also be clear that further extensions of this formalism , giving rise to new predictions such as the `` spontaneous parametric up conversion '' proposed in @xcite ( and apparently also disproved by experimental work in @xcite ) , are not addressed ( and hence are irrelevant for our discussions ) here .",
    "now , i am still convinced that no conclusive proof of the violation of local - realism ( lr ) has ever been obtained : we have the absence of proper space - like separation or `` locality loophole '' in experiments with massive particles , and the so - called `` detection loophole '' in experiments with photons , and something related to this last in the latest important development ( @xcite , see secs.[comp ] ) .",
    "each of these `` loopholes '' places the corresponding experimental observations within the frontiers of lr , and once there nothing is happening that can not ( and should not try to ) be understood from a purely classical framework , or at least from an intermediate one such as the one we deal with here .",
    "i use `` intermediate '' in the sense that what we have is a quantum formalism , but we are also incorporating , in an implicit way by considering the vacuum state which admits a well defined joint probability density as follows from the positivity of the wigner function , the limits imposed by lr .    indeed , those latest developments in @xcite are , in a way , even more compelling from the point of view of my claims than the usual bell experiments are : while these last are usually interpreted as proof of the `` non - local '' nature of qm , which is a way out to respect pure realism ( `` something is there even if we do not look at it '' ) , results in @xcite would suggest the non - existence of a well defined joint probability density for the results of a set of measurements performed locally upon a system , which is also that ( the non - existence ) of realism itself . after all , non - localities , such as action - at - a - distance , are also present in other branches of physics like for instance electromagnetism , but then always reconciled with lr once the full problem is considered ( in regard to e.m . , the apparition of retarded potentials ) , and at least showing reasonable properties such a decrease with growing distance between the parties . in view of @xcite , it is not any longer a matter of just some instantaneous interaction that does not fade away with distance , but something clearly more fundamental : `` things are not there until we look at them '' .",
    "the widespread willingness to accept such a view of physical reality before exhausting other alternatives seems demeaning to the concept of science itself : those alternatives have been proposed @xcite , including basic elements ( a random background of vacuum field fluctuations ) that do not look at all alien from the perspective of classical electromagnetism , and that even some recent works within the orthodox approach to the field now acknowledge @xcite . besides , and to my knowledge , @xcite is the only amongst other recent related tests @xcite which does not acknowledge , explicitly , one or other loophole leading to compatibility with the local - realistic interpretation . in any case , in absence ( i claim ) of conclusive results ,",
    "perhaps it is time to consider the possibility that not all states allowed by qm may have a physical counterpart , in particular those that would yield correlations defying lr . perhaps is also time to start giving credit to models that , even though being quantum - mechanical , may include that restriction built within their formulation ; here i propose a step in this direction .",
    "this step is necessary , but of course not conclusive : what we treat here is just that , a `` model '' .",
    "i hope it encourages further research , at least .",
    "the wigner picture of quantum optics of photon - entanglement generated by parametric down conversion @xcite was developed some years ago in a series of papers @xcite ; recently , the approach has been revitalized producing another stream of very interesting results @xcite .",
    "it departs from an stochastic electrodynamical description ( hence , based on continuous variables : electromagnetic fields defined at each and every point of space ) , and by use of the so - called wigner transformation @xcite it acquires a form where all expectation values depend on a certain probability distribution for the value of those fields in the vacuum .",
    "such a picture clearly differs , on the other hand , from the usual one in quantum information ( qinf ) , based on a discrete description of the photon ( a particle ) and not on a set of fields in a continuum space . for instance , in a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , empty polarization channels at either of the exits of the device are filled with the random components of the vacuum zero - point field ( zpf ) ; these random components can for instance give rise to the enhancement of the detection probability for certain realizations of the state of the fields ( certain photons , in the qed language ) : see note @xcite .",
    "phenomena such as this last come as a big difference with the customary model of the set polarizer - detector is treated just as a `` black box '' , able to extract polarization information in principle without the ( explicit ) intervention of any additional noise .",
    "the wigner - pdc framework provides an alternative , apparently local - realistic explanation of the results of many typically quantum experiments , the result of a measurement depending on ( and only on ) the set of hidden variables ( hv ) inside its light cone : in this case , both the signal propagating from the source and the additional noise introduced by the zpf at intermediate devices and detectors . within the first series of papers @xcite those experiments included : frustrated two photon creation via interference @xcite ; induced coherence and indistinguishableness in two - photon interference @xcite ; rarity and tapster s 1990 experiment with phase - momentum entanglement @xcite ; franson s ( original , 1989 ) experiment @xcite ; quantum _ dispersion cancellation _ and kwiat , steinberg and chiao s _ quantum eraser _ @xcite .    from the most recent one @xcite we can also add , on one side , amongst quantum cryptography experiments based on pdc : two - qubit entanglement and cryptography @xcite and quantum key distribution and eavesdropping @xcite ; on the other , an interpretation for the experimental partial measurement of the bell states generated from a single degree of freedom ( polarization ) in @xcite .",
    "we have also had access to some promising ( but still unpublished ) work on _ hyper - entanglement _",
    "@xcite .    perhaps needless to say",
    ", this `` local realistic '' picture of the quantum experiments takes place within the limits ( detection efficiencies ) where it is already well acknowledged that such an explanation may exist ; moreover , those limits arise as natural consequences of the theory : they are simply limiting values of detection rates for states of light that are ultimately generated from the vacuum .",
    "this last feature is what makes the wigner approach so interesting ; on the other hand , above we have used `` apparently '' because that local - realistic interpretation , even within the corresponding limits of detection rates , was until now not devoid of difficulties , in particular related to the detection model ( so far merely a one - to - one counterpart with glauber s original expressions @xcite ) : as a result of the normal order of operators , there average intensity due to vacuum fluctuations is `` subtracted '' , a subtraction that seems to introduce problems related to the appearance of what could be interpreted as `` negative probabilities '' . that last is the issue that interests us here , one that , as to be expected , did motivate the proposal of several modifications upon the expressions for the detection probabilities : for instance , as early as in @xcite , `` our theory is also in almost perfect one - to - one correspondence with the standard hilbert - space theory , the only difference being the modification in the detection probability that we proposed in relation ... '' .",
    "those modifications ranged from the mere inclusion of temporal and spatial integration @xcite to the proposal of much more complicated functional dependencies @xcite , all of them seeming to pose their own problems ; for instance in @xcite , a departure from the quantum predictions at low or high intensities , experimentally disproved for instance in @xcite .",
    "our route here is a different one however : we do not propose any modification of the initial expressions for the detection probabilities ( in one - to - one correspondence with the initial quantum electrodynamical model ) , but just explore the possibility of performing some convenient mathematical manipulation that casts them in a form consistent with the axioms of probability , hence one consistent with local - realism .",
    "following for instance @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , quantum mechanical detection probabilities , single and joint , can respectively be expressed as @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 are vacuum amplitudes of the ( relevant set of ) frequency modes @xcite at the entrance of the crystal , @xmath3 is obtained as the wigner transform of the vacuum state , @xmath4 is the field intensity ( for that mode ) and @xmath5 the mean intensity due to the vacuum amplitudes , both at the entrance of the @xmath6-th detector ( see @xcite ) : @xmath7 the last three expressions would in principle allow us to identify the vacuum amplitudes with a vector of hidden variables @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the space of events or probabilistic space ) , with an associated density function @xmath10 , @xmath11 now , for instance in @xcite it is already acknowledged that ( [ marginal])([joint ] ) can not , because of the possible negativity of the difference @xmath12 , be written as @xmath13 where naturally @xmath14 should stay positive ( or zero ) always .",
    "this last is our point of departure : in this paper we propose a reinterpretation of the former marginal and joint detection probabilities based on a certain manipulation of expressions ( [ marginal])([joint ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[no_pol",
    "] we will consider a setup with just a source and two detectors ; once that is understood , the interposition of other devices between the source and the detectors poses no additional conceptual difficulty though it is nevertheless convenient to address it in some detail : this will be done in sec .",
    "the calculations in these two sections find support on the proofs provided in appendix [ math ] , and stand for our main result in this paper .",
    "[ fac ] explores the question of `` @xmath15-factorability '' in the model , not only from the mathematical point of view but also providing some more physical insights on its implications .",
    "up to that point the novel points of the paper are made and its results are self - contained ; it is nevertheless natural to extend our analysis to some of their further implications ( amongst these , the consequences for bell tests of local - realism , and also a recent related proposal ) , in sec .",
    "[ comp ] , where we also include a preliminary approach to questions regarding the physics of the real detectors .",
    "finally , overall conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ conc ] , and some supplementary material is provided in appendix [ rev ] , which may not only help make the paper self - contained but perhaps also contribute to clarify some of the questions addressed , in particular the non - factorability issue .",
    "our reinterpretation of expressions ( [ marginal])([joint ] ) involves two steps :    \\(a ) knowing that the following equality holds ( from here on we drop detector indexes when unnecessary ) , for some real constant @xmath16 ( `` marginal '' ) , @xmath17 we realize we do not need to assume @xmath18 as a necessary , compulsory choice ; it would be enough to find some @xmath19 , satisfying @xmath20 so we can then safely identify @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this last is nothing but solving a linear system with only one restriction and an infinite number of free parameters , whose subspace of solutions intersects the region",
    "@xmath22 @xmath24 : see appendix [ math ] . of course ,",
    "once at this point , joint detection probabilities would in principle impose additional restrictions on @xmath25 ; for detectors @xmath26 we would have , for some constant @xmath27 ( `` joint '' ) , @xmath28    \\(b ) in principle , it is unclear whether all possible @xmath25 s satisfying ( [ eq_marginal_1 ] ) can be made to meet ( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) , therefore we propose : instead of demanding ( [ eq_joint_1 ] ) from the beginning , we define a new function @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 so we can now identify @xmath31 in appendix [ math ] we have shown that it is always possible to find some suitable @xmath32 , for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , for all possible pairs @xmath2 .",
    "the absence of factorability on the @xmath15 s , i.e. , the fact that ( we may have ) @xmath35 may come as a surprise to some , given than clauser - horne factorability @xcite on the hidden variable @xmath36 is usually taken for granted ; this is a mistake @xcite .",
    "we have tried to clarify the whole issue in appendix [ rev ] : in general , we have shown that that non - factorability , aside from perfectly legitimate from the mathematical perspective , is in this case possibly related with the need to include new hidden variables in the model .",
    "it is now convenient , for the following sections , to make our notation lighter , with @xmath37 , and also to define @xmath38",
    "once we place one or more devices between the crystal and the detectors , typically polarizers , polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) or other devices to allow polarization measurements ( such as in fig . [ scheme ] ) , in general we can not any longer describe the fields between both with only one set @xmath39 of mode - amplitudes ; we need to redefine our @xmath15 s as now associated to a particular position @xmath40 ( they do not any longer determine a frequency mode for all space @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we will now have @xmath41 and , letting @xmath42 be the position of the source ( the crystal ) , and @xmath43 the position of the @xmath6-th polarizer or pbs ( or any other intermediate device ) , we will also redefine @xmath44 with @xmath45 including the _ relevant _ amplitudes at the ( empty ) exit channels of that @xmath6-th intermediate device . with @xmath46 corresponding each to ( a set of ) modes with different ( sets of relevant ) wavevectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite , we can then regard them as two ( sets of ) statistically independent random variables , with all generality .",
    "the intensity at the entrance of detector @xmath6-th will therefore depend now not only on @xmath49 but also on @xmath45 : @xmath50 once more , something like that can always be rewritten ( see former section ) , for some suitable and positively defined @xmath51 , as @xmath52 integrating on @xmath45 we would obtain @xmath53 from where we define a new function @xmath54 . on the other hand , for joint detections we would have @xmath55 which again can always be rewritten ( again see former section ) , for some positively defined @xmath56 , as @xmath57 and integrating on @xmath58 we would obtain @xmath59 from where we can again define yet another new probability density function @xmath60 .",
    "it is interesting for the sake of clarity to compare the two situations : with ( primed functions ) and without polarizers ( unprimed ) .",
    "it is easy to see that , because the detector only sees the intensity at its entrance channel , clearly ( we drop the `` s '' subscript for simplicity ) , @xmath61 while , naturally , in general @xmath62 , as well as @xmath63 .",
    "let us go back to the case with just the source and the detectors ; we will soon see the following does nevertheless also apply when polarizers or other devices are added to the setup , just the same .",
    "according to our reasonings in app .",
    "[ rev ] , and using ( [ f_hat])([gamma_hat ] ) , we now realize that there is no way to avoid @xmath64 unless we introduce some additional dependence of the kind @xmath65 , so that then @xmath66 where we add a second `` hat '' to avoid an abuse of notation , and where @xmath67 stands for a new set of random variables .",
    "this @xmath68 should be interpreted as a detection probability conditioned to the new vector of random variables @xmath67 , i.e , @xmath69 we will impose further demands on @xmath68 , defining @xmath70 something forced by strictly physical arguments : the choice @xmath71 must prevail over other possible ones - for instance @xmath72 - due to the need to respect the dependence of the probabilities of detection ( conditioned to @xmath15 or not ) alone on the intensity that arrives to the detector , and nothing else .",
    "now , with the density function @xmath73 , we could write @xmath74 allowing us to recover our former definitions ( [ f_hat])([gamma_hat ] ) : @xmath75 for joint detections , the additional variable @xmath67 is particularly relevant because , we will always have that while @xmath76 in general @xmath77 or we could equivalently say that while necessarily @xmath78 in general @xmath79 where of course @xmath80    to conclude this section , we recover the case with intermediate devices : due to @xmath58 being , as defined , independent from one another and also from @xmath49 , our hypothetical `` flag '' @xmath67 can not be associated with none of them .",
    "therefore , in general , and in principle , not only @xmath81 but also @xmath82 either .",
    "we use `` in principle '' because this question is not yet analyzed in detail ; we now see crystal clear , though , that this possible non - factorability on @xmath15 s is nothing more than an internal feature of the model s mathematical structure , bearing no relevance in regard to its double - sided compatibility ( or absence of it ) both with local - realism and the quantum predicted correlations .",
    "indeed , the crucial element in that sense is the intervention of new random vacuum amplitudes introduced by the new devices in the setup , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ comp ] .",
    "recapitulating , we have that while @xmath83 , however @xmath84 , where @xmath67 would be a new , additional hv ( or vector of hv s ) and should , in the ultimate term , correspond to some physically relevant variable that we have so far overlooked , perhaps containing additional information about the state of the crystal and the laser .",
    "indeed , if it was eventually necessary to introduce a new variable @xmath67 , physical intuition suggests that it could probably be associated to the phase of the laser complex amplitude @xcite ; with the laser in a coherent state , it would be justified to approximate @xmath85 , where @xmath86 would be the phase or the quasi - classical wave .",
    "perhaps it is needless to add that in such a case expressions such as ( [ int_mu ] ) or a similar one for @xmath87 s would still be fully operative , as long as the dependence on @xmath86 is `` absorbed '' in the functional dependence at the left side of the equation . anyway , whether this @xmath67 has an obvious physical meaning or not should not bother us too much here , as it does not affect at all the correctness and/or the implications of our mathematical results .",
    "though former mathematical developments are fully meaningful and self - contained on their own , yet it would be convenient to give some hints on how a local - realist ( lr ) model can account for typically quantum correlations , which are known to defy that very same local realism ( lr ) . in the first place and as a general answer , what the wigner - pdc picture proves is that lr is respected by a certain subset of all the possible quantum states , specifically the ones that can be generated from a non - linear mix of the qed - vacuum ( which therefore acts as an `` input '' for the model ) with a quasi - classical ( a high - intensity coherent state ) , highly directional signal , the laser `` pump '' ( which indeed enters in the model as a non - quantized , external potential @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , such a restriction is clearly not arbitrary at all , since it arises from a very simple quantum electrodynamical model of the process of generation of polarization - entangled pairs of photons from parametric down conversion ( pdc ) : see for instance eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) in @xcite .      aside from subscripts",
    ", we will now also drop `` hats '' and `` primes '' for simplicity ; of course the fact that @xmath88 may not be in general @xmath15-factorisable , @xmath89 does not at all mean that it can not well satisfy @xmath90 \\cdot \\left [ \\int f_j(\\alpha^{\\prime})\\ w(\\alpha^{\\prime})\\ d\\alpha^{\\prime } \\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ % * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. ( let us from now use superscripts `` w '' and `` exp '' to denote , respectively , theoretical and experimental detection rates ) : @xmath91 which is indeed the sense in which the hypothesis of `` error independence '' is introduced , to our knowledge , in every work on lhv models @xcite .",
    "this sort of conditions over `` average '' probabilities ( average in the sense that they are integrated in the hidden variable , may that be @xmath15 alone or also some other one ) are the only ones that can be tested in the actual experiment ; there , we can just rely on the number of counts registered on a certain time - window @xmath92 , and the corresponding estimates of the type @xmath93 now , if we wish to include some additional uncertainty element reflecting the technological limitations ( a `` detection efficiency '' parameter ) , what we have to do is to redefine the overall detection probabilities as @xmath94 as well as @xmath95 where @xmath96 would play the role of such an ( alleged ) detection efficiency , the `` hats '' remarking the fact that the customary definition of the analogous quantity in qinf involves not only our @xmath97 s but also the non - technological contribution . from the point of view of the experimenter",
    "it is very difficult to isolate both components ( glauber s theory @xcite does not predict a unit detection probability even for high intensity signals ) ; we should perhaps then confine ourselves to the term `` observable detection rate '' instead of using the clearly misleading one of `` detector inefficiency '' .",
    "that said and going to a lowest level of detail , states in such an ( lr ) subset of qed can still indeed exhibit correlations of the class that is believed to collide with lr , yet the procedure through which they are extracted from the experimental set of data does not meet one of the basic assumptions required by every test of a bell inequality : they do not keep statistical significance with respect to the physical set of `` states '' or hidden instructions @xcite ) . to guarantee that statistical significance we must introduce some of the following two hypothesis : ( i ) all coincidence detection probabilities are independent of the polarizers orientations",
    "@xmath98 ( this is what we call `` fair - sampling '' @xcite , for a test of an homogeneous inequality @xcite ) , which implies @xmath99 where of course ( see sec . [ pol ] ) @xmath100 , and where we recall that @xmath98 would determine which vacuum modes amongst the sets @xmath58 would intervene in the detection process , + ( ii ) the interposition of an element between the source and the detector can not in any case enhance the probability of detection ( the `` no - enhancement '' hypothesis @xcite , needed to test the clauser - horne inequality @xcite , and presumably every other inhomogeneous one @xcite ) , @xmath101 with @xmath102 denoting the absence of polarizer and with @xmath103 this time .",
    "following our developments in sec .",
    "[ pol ] one can easily see that ( i ) is not in general true , and according to @xcite neither is ( ii ) .",
    "i.e. , whenever states of light are prepared so as to produce the sort of quantum correlations that are known to defy lr , these last come supplemented with the necessary features that prevent it from happening ... how could it not ?",
    "yet , a mere breach of ( i ) or ( ii ) is not enough to assert the existence of a local hidden variables ( lhv ) model , which is an equivalent way of saying that the results of the experiment respect lr : it is more than well known that this can only happen for certain values of the observed detection rates @xcite .",
    "however , from the point of view of ( [ eta_red_m])([eta_red_j ] ) , and given the fact that , as proven in secs [ no_pol ] and [ pol ] , the wigner - pdc is in all circumstances in accordance with expressions ( [ a_loc_causal])([b_loc_causal ] ) , and hence to all possible bell inequalities whether our @xmath97 s are equal or less than unity , the so - called `` critical efficiencies '' would merely stand , at least as far as pdc - generated photons are concerned , for bounds on the detection rates that we can experimentally observe ( these last in turn constrained by the only subset of quantum states that we can physically prepare ) .",
    "the recent test in @xcite would seem formally equivalent to a bell test of an homogeneous inequality @xcite , but for two questions : ( i ) they do not require remote observers ; ( ii ) the use of analogical measurements , that would seem to exclude the so - called `` detection loophole '' that is widely recognized in other tests .",
    "the purpose of this section is to show that such loophole still remains , though making it evident requires a subtler approach , according to our approach here one perhaps more realistic than the usual assumption of `` random errors '' .",
    "besides , and to my knowledge , @xcite is the only amongst other recent related tests @xcite which does not acknowledge , explicitly , one or other loophole leading to compatibility with the local - realistic interpretation .    basically , kot _ et al _ s proposal in @xcite rests on the probing of some `` test function '' @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is an outcome obtained when an observable @xmath106 is measured , and where @xmath107 is a set of mutually exclusive observables .",
    "later , they will be concerned with an `` average '' @xmath108 , which , if a local hidden variables ( lhv ) model turned out to exist , would have to be expressible as @xmath109 with @xmath36 as usual a vector of hidden variables and @xmath9 the overall space of events .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 would stand for a joint probability density function ( conditioned to the state @xmath36 ) for any set of ( predetermined ) results for any set of possible measurements upon the observables @xmath111 .",
    "each @xmath106 will be then sampled on a different subset @xmath112 ... which would be no problem as long as all @xmath113 are statistically faithful to @xmath9 ; however , the fact that measurements may not always give a result ( or that these measurements are effectively completed at different time - stamps ) may destroy that statistical significance , hence invalidating that of the estimate of @xmath114 . to show that this may happen even in view of ( ii )",
    ", we must go to glauber s expression in ( [ glauber_s ] ) .",
    "the key is that , for a given time - stamp , in general @xmath115 , though of course after a certain interval @xmath116 the accumulated probability , @xmath117 may approach unity , something irrelevant for our argument : the hypothetical @xmath118-instructions in a hypothetical lhv model ( see for instance @xcite ) would no longer have anything to do with some `` detection inefficiency '' , but simply express the fact that for some given time - stamp and observable , @xmath119 may be less than unity .",
    "other models of `` detection '' may involve a time - integral of the intensity at the entrance of the detector , or other sophistications ; they would not affect our argument as long as we recognize ( [ glauber_s ] ) as a time - dependent quantity , in general satisfying @xmath120 .",
    "once here , the physical connection with the test in @xcite can be established by assigning to each time stamp @xmath121 a set @xmath122 of hidden instructions of the usual kind ( i.e. , a different lhv model @xmath122 for each @xmath121 ) : again see @xcite .",
    "in particular , following @xcite , a detection on the `` signal '' arm , at a time - stamp @xmath121 , prompts the analysis of the signal ( coming from the homodyne setup and entering a high frequency oscilloscope ) at the `` idler '' one , over a fixed time window . yet",
    ", a correlation between the detection time - stamp at the signal arm and the choice of observable at the idler would seem to require communication or `` signaling '' between the two measurement setups .",
    "this last difficulty , which would burden our argument with the need for an additional `` locality loophole '' , can , however , be overcome too : consider an observable @xmath123 that ( always ) produces two possible results @xmath124 . for simplicity",
    "let us this time denote @xmath125 the probability of an outcome @xmath126 when @xmath127 is measured on the state @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath128 however , if each result is associated to a detection at a different set of time - stamps , @xmath129 , then the experimentally accessible quantity is @xmath130 in this last expression , @xmath131 are again two different sets selected by the correlation between the time - stamp at one arm and the result of the measurement at the other when @xmath123 is measured .",
    "according to the approach in @xcite , the set of relevant vacuum electromagnetic modes inserted at the source are still contained in the fields arriving at each detector , and this will indeed induce some correlation between detection time - stamp at one side and a measurement s outcome at the other , and in general between any two events which are related to the intensity of the incoming signal .",
    "this induced correlation is also at the core of other recent results in @xcite .",
    "a more detailed argument can be obtained by e - mail from the author .",
    "this section approaches some physical considerations with the aim of showing that there is plenty of room for a suitable physical interpretation of the model , even when that is not strictly necessary for the coherence of our results , at least from the purely mathematical point of view .",
    "indeed , we have already descended to the physical level when we established , in former sections , the dependence of our @xmath132 s and @xmath133 s solely on the intensity arriving at the detector .",
    "expectable behavior for a physical device would typically include a `` dead - zone '' , an approximately linear range and a `` saturation '' at high intensities ( this is indeed the kind of behavior suggested for instance in @xcite ) ; amongst other restrictions this would imply , for instance , @xmath134 , when @xmath135 ( this last a threshold that may even surpass the expectation value of the zpf intensity ) , as well as @xmath136 either for @xmath137 or @xmath138 below @xmath139 .",
    "neither these restrictions nor other similar ones would in principle invalidate our proofs in appendix [ math ] , which seem to provide room enough to simulate a wide range of possible behaviors ; however , we must remark that none of our @xmath132 s and @xmath133 s can ultimately be considered as fully physical models , due to the fact that they represent point - like detectors ( the implications of such an over - simplification may become clearer in the light of our following point here ) .    in close relation to the former",
    ", we also propose here a simple physical interpretation of the term @xmath140 appearing in the expressions for the detection probabilities . from the mathematical point of view",
    "such subtraction arises from a mere manipulation of glauber s original expression @xcite . from the physical one ,",
    "a realistic interpretation would be more than desirable , as that subtraction of zpf intensity is for instance crucial to explain the absence of an observable contribution of the vacuum field on the detectors rates @xcite ; of course we mean `` explain in physical terms '' ; from the mathematical point of view our model here already predicts a vanishing detection probability for the zpf alone .",
    "my suggestion is that the @xmath140 term must be ( at least ) related to the average flux of energy going through the surface of the detector in the opposite direction to the signal ( therefore _ leaving _ the detector ) .",
    "that interpretation fits the picture of a detector as a physical system producing a signal that depends ( with more or less proportionality on some range ) on the total energy ( intensity times surface times time ) that it accumulates .",
    "i am just saying `` at least related '' , bearing in mind that to establish such association we would first have to refine the point - like model of a detector which stems directly from the original glauber s expression @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the wigner description of pdc - generated ( parametric down conversion ) photon - entanglement , so enthusiastically developed in the late nineties @xcite but then ignored in recent years , can be formulated as entirely local - realistic ( lr ) .",
    "a formalism that is one - to - one with a quantum ( field - theoretical ) model of the experimental setup can be cast , thanks to an additional manipulation ( also one - to - one ) , into a form that respects all axiomatic laws of probability @xcite , and therefore lr , as defined for instance in sec .",
    "the original quantum electrodynamical model takes as an input the vacuum state , which accepts a well defined probabilistic description through the so - called wigner transform : this is the fact that the analogy with a local - realistic theory is conditioned to . what we call wigner - pdc accounts , then , for a certain subset within the space of all possible qed - states , determined by a particular set of initial conditions and a certain hamiltonian governing the time - evolution @xcite , restrictions that seem to guarantee ( according to us here ) the compatibility with lr .",
    "aiming for the maximum generality , as well as to avoid some possible ( still under examination ) difficulties with factorisable expressions , we have renounced to what we call @xmath15-_factorability _ of the joint detection expressions .",
    "such a choice is not only perfectly legitimate @xcite , but may also be supported by a well feasible interpretation ( see appendix [ fac ] ) ; nevertheless , further implications of that non - factorability on @xmath15 will also be left to be examined elsewhere .",
    "again , whatever they finally turn out to be , they are also irrelevant for our main result in this paper : the wigner - pdc formalism can be cast into a form that respects all axiomatic laws of probability for space - like separated events .",
    "neither does the explicit distinction between the cases where polarizers ( or other devices placed between the source and the detectors ) are or not included in the setup introduce any conceptual difference from the point of view of our main result ; however , the question opens room to remark some of the main differences of the wigner - pdc model ( actually , also its hilbert - space analogue ) with the customary description used in the field of quantum information ( qinf ) : here , each new device introduces noise , new vacuum amplitudes that fill each of its empty polarization channels at each of its exists , in contrast to the usual qinf `` black box '' , able to extract polarization information from a photon without any indeterministic component . as a matter of fact , those additional random components hold the key to explain the variability of the detection probability ( see note @xcite ) that is necessary , from the point of view of bell inequalities , to reconcile quantum predictions and lr ( see sec .",
    "[ lr_v_qm ] ) .",
    "in particular , the immediacy with which the phenomenon of `` detection probability enhancement '' arises in the wigner - pdc framework would suggest that this may be after all the right track to understand why after several decades the minimum detection rates ( or , in qinf terminology , critical detection efficiencies ) that would lead to obtain conclusive evidence of non - locality are yet to be reached @xcite . in sec.[kot ] we have also addressed a recent no - go test that i consider particularly relevant , as it does not explicitly acknowledge any loophole , and which could also be given a local - realistic interpretation in the light of the present framework .    in sec . [ sub ] we have done a first , general approach on the question of whether our reinterpretation of the detection probabilities is consistent with the actual physical behavior of detectors .",
    "a closer look to this question is nevertheless left out of the scope of the paper ; former proposals @xcite in regard to this issue aimed perhaps too straightforwardly to the physical level , while they did not even guarantee consistency with the framework we have settled here ( proof of this is that it introduces divergences in relation to the purely quantum predictions , divergences later experimentally disproved for instance in @xcite ) . in close relation with the former ,",
    "we have also suggested a possible simple physical interpretation of @xmath141-subtraction taking place in the expressions for the detection probabilities : work in any of this two directions would anyway require a departure from the point - like model of a detector on which we have focused here .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that a whole family of detection models @xmath142 can be found , consistent both with the quantum mechanical expressions from the wigner - pdc model and lr .",
    "a close examination of the constraints coming from the physical behavior of the detectors and other experimentally testable features is left as a necessary step for the future , with the aim of establishing a subset physically feasible ones ; nevertheless , we have the guarantee that all of them produce suitable predictions , as so does their quantum electrodynamical counterpart . yet",
    ", even at the purely theoretical level some other features remain open too : as a fundamental one , to what extent the model requires what we have called non - factorability on @xmath15 s . once more and after all , qm is just a theory , a theory that provides a formalism upon which to build models , models than can ( and should ) be refined based on experimental evidence , something that ( again ) also applies just as well to the one we are dealing with here @xcite .",
    "perhaps the particle properties of light are not enough to assume that the current model of `` a photon '' is the best representation ( and most complete ) that we can achieve of light ; many of those properties can be understood , i believe , from entirely classical models @xcite , as well .",
    "quantum entanglement seems to manifest in many of its `` reasonable '' features but at least as ( this particular model of ) parametric down conversion is concerned and so far , whenever local - realism would seem to be challenged new phenomena can be invoked so as to prevent , at least potentially , that possibility .",
    "such are `` unfair sampling '' , `` enhancement '' ( as a particular case of variable detection probability ) and over all detection rates low enough to open room for the former two .",
    "those phenomena find theoretical support in the wigner - pdc picture , but definitely not in the usual , based merely on the correspondence between the @xmath143-spin algebra for massive particles and the polarization states of a plane wave ( a photon then looks just as a @xmath143-spin particle , what some like to call a two - level system , but for the magnitude of the angular momentum it carries , and its statistics of course ) .",

    "+ see , for instance : emilio santos , `` how photon detectors remove vacuum fluctuations '' , http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207073v2 ( 2008 ) .",
    "+ we remark again that this issue is in any case irrelevant for our main results here : it concerns models built outside of the quantum framework ( which is not our case ) .",
    "nevertheless , we conjecture that our proposed interpretation of ( i ) in sec .",
    "[ conc ] may be of use to make progress on the question .",
    "let @xmath9 be a space of events , all possible probability assignations within the formalism , @xmath269 , satisfy @xmath270 @xmath271 and , for any partition @xmath272 of @xmath9 ( assuming of course additivity on disjoint subsets of events ) , @xmath273 .",
    "+ all bell inequalities ( at least those written in terms of probabilities ) can be obtained as a derivation from these laws , plus some very simple supplementary assumptions : statistical independence of variables defined at distant locations . of course , bell inequalities written in terms of correlations can be also written in terms of probabilities .",
    "many do no even need such supplementary assumptions ( space - like separation ones or of another kind ) : such is the case of both the ch @xcite and the chsh @xcite inequalities . to illustrate this",
    "see for instance @xcite s derivation of the ch inequality ; the chsh inequality can on the other hand also be interpreted as a mere algebraic inequality on whatever four quantities taking values @xmath274 .",
    "@xmath3 is a gaussian @xcite ; hence @xmath153 @xmath24 .",
    "a possible ( not unique ) procedure to build @xmath67 is this : for each @xmath195 , we define a new random variable @xmath275 and assign values for each pair @xmath276 : @xmath277 , and now simply do @xmath278 .",
    "as built , @xmath275 s are not necessarily independent from one another , nor are they necessarily independent from @xmath36 .",
    "a.casado , phd thesis : `` estudio de los experimentos de conversin paramtrica a la baja con el formalismo de la funcin de wigner '' ( universidad de sevilla , 1998 ) . the pdc model is by construction restricted to a certain subset of qed - states , obtained directly from a mix of the vacuum state ( hence one with positive wigner function ) with a quasi - classical signal ( the laser ) , and a time - evolution governed by a quadratic hamiltonian ( hence one that preserves the positivity of the wigner function ) ; for this last point , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "for instance , the description of the `` pump '' ( laser beam ) as a non - quantized , external potential is just an approximation ( one that allows for a hamiltonian that is quadratic in creation / annihilation operators , and hence preserves positivity of the wigner function ) ; in any case , we should not forget that further refinements may include not only quantization of the laser but also additional terms expressing the interaction with further zpf modes neglected in the present formulation .",
    "for instance , the inclusion of particle sub - structure could also be the way forward to explain other peculiarities of the quantum world that seem so far alien to a purely classical framework .",
    "in particular , two very crucial points : + ( i ) the appearance of a discrete spectrum of observable energy exchanges between matter and the electromagnetic field , due to the presence of meta - stable states ( `` attractors '' ) in the classical phase space of the system ( for instance the hydrogen atom ) , once observations are assumed as some time - average that smears out transients , being therefore reduced to a discrete spectrum of states and transitions between them ; + ( ii ) the possibility of highly directional radiation patterns ( emission of energy ) and resonances ( absorption of energy ) , in the same way as they arise in macroscopic systems with rich spatial structure . + point ( i )",
    "can potentially accommodate the famous `` quanta '' @xmath279 relation , attempts at which we have left at an intermediate step elsewhere ; point ( ii ) would make possible the transfer of energy through long distances with no spread ."
