    "consider a finite composite quantum system described by the complex hilbert space @xmath0 , which is the tensor product of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath3 of dimension @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) ; and has dimension @xmath6 .",
    "given any hamiltonian @xmath7 acting on @xmath8 , the thermal equilibrium ( or gibbs ) state @xmath9 for temperature @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "since the quantum system is assumed to be finite , negative temperatures are possible , but they will be disregarded here for reasons of economy although the effects described below are also present for negative temperatures .",
    "+ since the system has components , the question of the entanglement of the gibbs - states arises .",
    "we recall that an arbitrary state @xmath12 ( mixed or pure ) of the composite system is said to be _",
    "separable _ or _ unentangled _ if it can be written as a mixture ( finite convex sum ) of pure product states .",
    "if this is not the case , the state is said to be _",
    "entangled_. + at present there are finite algorithms deciding whether a given state is entangled or not only for two qubits ( @xmath13 with @xmath14 ) ; and for @xmath13 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the entanglement studies presented in the literature have , perforce , been restricted to investigations of the entanglement of the gibbs - state reduced to the possible two - component subsystems , or to the study of particular so called entanglement witnesses or other entanglement monotone functions @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we present some features of the entanglement issue for thermal equilibrium states for the bipartite systems mentioned .",
    "the rest of this introduction collects basic information which is generally valid , i.e. , for any @xmath1 and @xmath17 , and some of which seems to have been overlooked previously .",
    "+ in what follows we often identify the state @xmath12 viewed as a linear positive functional acting on operators @xmath18 and giving their expected - value @xmath19 , with the density operator @xmath12 such that @xmath20 .",
    "if the hamiltonian is a real multiple of the identity , @xmath21 , then @xmath22 for all @xmath10 , or viewed as a functional , the normalized trace which we denote by @xmath23 . since @xmath24 the normalized trace @xmath23 is a separable state .",
    "we assume henceforth that the hamiltonian @xmath25 is not a multiple of the identity , and let @xmath26 be the spectral projection associated with the minimal ( ground - state energy ) eigenvalue @xmath27 whose multiplicity we denote by @xmath28 . for the ground - state @xmath29 , one has @xmath30 where the limit can be taken in various ways . as the limit of matrix elements in any orthonormal basis",
    "you wish ; or @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the absolute value of the operator @xmath33 ; etc .",
    "moreover @xmath34 in the same sense , and the map @xmath35 is continuous .",
    "+ for what follows it will be important to observe that the energy @xmath36 as a function of temperature , is a monotone increasing continuous function with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a critical or threshold temperature above which entanglement is impossible has been observed in all cited studies .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for every hamiltonian there exists a finite critical temperature @xmath39 which satisfies : ( i ) @xmath40 ; ( ii ) @xmath41 is separable for every @xmath42 $ ] ; and ( iii ) for every @xmath43 there are entangled thermal states with temperatures in the interval @xmath44 .",
    "we call @xmath39 the _ lower separability temperature_. even if @xmath25 is not a multiple of the identity , it could still be trivial in the sense that it contains no interactions whatsoever between the component subsystems , @xmath45 , @xmath46 acting only on the @xmath47-th component . in this case",
    "@xmath48 is a product - state , hence unentangled and @xmath49 .",
    "a very poor upper bound on @xmath39 was given in @xcite ; and the question of what happens below @xmath39 was posed and left open .",
    "it will be essentially answered in section ii .",
    "+ it is important to stress the fact that the convex set of separable states is closed , and this implies that the set of non - negative temperatures @xmath10 for which @xmath9 is unentangled , is closed . accordingly , the non - negative temperatures @xmath10 for which @xmath9 is entangled is an open set in @xmath50 . + by their very definition , entanglement witnesses or entanglement monotone functions will always provide temperatures for which the thermal states are entangled and these temperatures are lower bounds on @xmath39 .",
    "a particularly simple witness is the energy itself as observed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath51 , that is the lowest energy expectation value obtainable with an unentangled state .",
    "the infimum is assumed , and since the map @xmath52 is convex - linear , it can be taken over the pure product - states .",
    "+ if for some @xmath53 we have @xmath54 , then @xmath55 is entangled . by the monotone increase of @xmath56 and the intermediate - value theorem",
    "there is a unique @xmath57 such that @xmath58 and all gibbs states with temperatures in @xmath59 are entangled ( in particular @xmath60 is entangled ) . in @xcite , @xmath61 is denoted by @xmath62 and called the entanglement - gap temperature .",
    "it follows that @xmath63 .",
    "it does not follow that gibbs states with temperatures ( immediately ) above @xmath61 are necessarily separable .",
    "although @xmath64 does indeed signal the presence of thermal entanglement at low enough temperatures , its importance should not be overrated .",
    "the correct critical value is : @xmath65 ; for which one can prove , as in @xcite , that : ( i ) @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is separable ; and ( ii ) @xmath68 if and only if @xmath60 is entangled , and in this case all thermal states with temperatures in @xmath69 are entangled .",
    "alternatively , @xmath62 could be defined as the greatest temperature such that all gibbs - states with temperatures below it are entangled ; we call @xmath62 the _ upper entanglement temperature_. obviously , @xmath70 , but one should expect that , in general , @xmath61 can be a rather poor lower bound on @xmath62 .",
    "the following example should serve as illustration .",
    "+ consider two qubits ; and suppose the minimal energy @xmath71 of your hamiltonian is doubly degenerate with ground - state vectors @xmath72 , and @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) is an eigenstate of @xmath76 to the eigenvalue @xmath77 ( resp .",
    "@xmath78 ) for one qubit .",
    "then the ground - state is @xmath79 , and it is entangled ( the partial transpose of @xmath60 has a negative eigenvalue ) ; @xmath80 and thus @xmath81 ; but @xmath82 .      the theory of the more mixed thanpartial ordering of states of a quantum system , @xcite , can be put to use in the discussion of entanglement of gibbs states .",
    "it is a result of wehrl and uhlmann ( cf",
    "@xcite ) , that @xmath83 implies @xmath84 , for every unitarily invariant , concave , continuous real - valued functional @xmath85 defined on states .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , that for every such functional @xmath85 , for which @xmath86 implies @xmath87 , there is a critical constant @xmath88 such that : ( i ) if the state @xmath12 satisfies @xmath89 then @xmath12 is separable ; and ( ii ) for every possible value @xmath90 of @xmath85 below @xmath91 there is an entangled state @xmath92 with @xmath93",
    ". there is an analogous version of this for unitarily invariant , convex , continuous real - valued functionals .",
    "thus , every unitarily invariant , continuous real - valued functional which isolates @xmath23 and is either convex or concave , acts as a separability detector and can be used to obtain an upper bound on @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , take such a concave separability detector @xmath85 .",
    "then , @xmath94 is a non - decreasing continuous function for which @xmath95 . by the intermediate - value theorem",
    "there is @xmath96 such that @xmath97 and all gibbs states with temperatures in @xmath98 $ ] are unentangled .",
    "it follows that @xmath99 .",
    "+      many of the available studies , e.g. @xcite , observe that the bipartite subsystem entanglement of thermal states need not be monotone in temperature .",
    "+ the above results allow one to distinguish various entanglement scenarios .",
    "the uninteresting scenario occurs when @xmath100 as happens when the hamiltonians present no interactions whatsoever .",
    "but this scenario is possible even when interactions are present , cf .",
    "section ii .",
    "+ the next scenario is that in which the ground - state is separable , i.e. , @xmath101 , but @xmath102 .",
    "then as temperature increases away from zero , separability is lost at some temperature @xmath103 . for temperatures in the separable segment",
    "@xmath104 $ ] all gibbs states are unentangled , and the segment @xmath105 contains temperatures for which the corresponding thermal states are entangled .",
    "the possibility arises for various closed separable segments ( @xmath104 , [ t_2 , t_3]$ ] , @xmath106 $ ] ) alternating with open entanglement segments ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) .",
    "we will present examples for this abnormal scenario in section ii .",
    "+ the other scenarios occur",
    "when the ground - state @xmath60 is entangled , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the normal case is @xmath109 and this is what has been observed in most studies we know of .",
    "although , entanglement usually decreases with increasing temperature , one can have non - monotonous behaviour , cf .",
    "section ii .",
    "the abnormal scenario is @xmath110 , and then there is a temperature @xmath111 with @xmath112 such that for @xmath113 $ ] , @xmath9 is unentangled but there are temperatures @xmath114 for which @xmath115 is entangled . again",
    "the way is open for closed separable segments alternating with open entanglement segments .",
    "examples of this behaviour are given in section ii .",
    "+      consider any state @xmath12 of the composite system and consider the segment joining the normalized trace @xmath23 to @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath118 is separable , one will ask in case @xmath119 is entangled , when as @xmath120 increases does one lose separability ?",
    "this question has been analyzed by many authors , notably by yczkowski , horodecki , sanpera , and lewenstein , @xcite , who develop it to obtain a method of estimating the `` size '' of the separable states ; and by vidal , and tarrach , @xcite , who give a virtually complete treatment of the problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the modulus of separability of @xmath12 was defined as @xmath121 , whereas the quantity considered by vidal and tarrach is @xmath122 and called by them _ the random robustness of entanglement_. here we only need to observe that @xmath123 , with @xmath124 if and only if @xmath125 is unentangled .",
    "moreover , the upper - semicontinuity property of @xmath126 obtained in @xcite , guarantees that the map @xmath127 is continuous .",
    "this in turn , proves the claims made in  [ crit ] about the sets of temperatures where the gibbs state is separable , respectively entangled .",
    "vidal and tarrach , @xcite have computed the modulus of separability for a qubit / qubit ( @xmath128 ) or a qubit / qutrit ( @xmath129 ) ; their beautiful formula is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the minimal eigenvalue of the partial - transpose of @xmath12 with respect to the qubit . the plots which we will exhibit",
    "show @xmath127 for selected hamiltonians which exemplify the distinct scenarios .",
    "+ the critical values ( or good upper and lower bounds ) are known for some functionals ( e.g. partial ordered eigenvalue sums , von neumann entropy ) from ref .",
    "@xcite and can thus be used to provide upper bounds on @xmath39 as described in  [ succ ] .",
    "the map @xmath132 is strictly convex ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 47 ) , unitarily invariant and is easily seen to isolate @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the critical value for the trace of the square is known to be @xmath133 for two qubits and it lies between @xmath134 and @xmath135 for a qubit / qutrit system ( @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out to be a rather useful separability detector because it is easy to calculate .",
    "although it often provides a rather poor upper bound on @xmath39 , in all the examples to be presented below it gave better bounds than those obtained using the partial eigenvalue sums , or the von neumann entropy .",
    "we denote by @xmath136 , the numerically obtained value of @xmath137 recall  [ succ] for @xmath85 equals minus the trace of the square ( using the bound @xmath134 for the qubit / qutrit case ) .",
    "we have not invested a lot of effort in the computation of @xmath138 of  [ crit ] .",
    "the temperature value @xmath61 obtained from the numerical , possibly inexact , value of @xmath138 need not necessarily be a lower bound for @xmath62 or even @xmath39 ; but in our experiments this never happened .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian counting multiplicities are given as a row - vector @xmath139 . since in our definition of @xmath9",
    "we have incorporated boltzmann s constant in the hamiltonian , the components of @xmath139 have the same dimension as the temperature .",
    "since thermal equilibrium states are invariant with respect to addition of a multiple of the identity to the hamiltonian , we choose @xmath140 .",
    "the eigenvector to the @xmath141-th eigenvalue @xmath142 is listed as a row vector @xmath143 , where the coordinates are with respect to the canonical orthonormal tensor - product basis built from the orthonormal basis @xmath144 of @xmath145 , and @xmath146 of @xmath147 .",
    "+ the hamiltonians to be presented are specifically chosen to exhibit transitions from entanglement to separability below @xmath39 , that is in the interval @xmath148 .",
    "the general idea is , obviously , to choose the eigenvector associated with the non - degenerate ground - state energy to be either separable or entangled and then the eigenvector associated to the first excited state to be , correspondingly , either entangled or separable .",
    "the minimal value of the separability modulus for two qubits is @xmath133 .",
    "+ figure 1 , shows the @xmath149 scenario with a separable segment @xmath104 $ ] followed by an entanglement segment @xmath150 . using the very same eigenvectors as those of fig . 1 , but with @xmath151",
    ", @xmath9 is unentangled for every @xmath152 , that is @xmath49 .",
    "+ figure 2 shows two instances of the standard normal scenario ( @xmath153 ) @xmath109 .",
    "+ in the qubit / qubit system , we have not found the scenario where @xmath154 ( cf . figure 3 for a qubit / qutrit ) .",
    "the minimal value of the separability modulus for a qubit / qutrit systems is @xmath155 .",
    "+ figure 3 shows the @xmath154 scenario ; the entanglement segment @xmath69 is followed by a separability segment @xmath156 $ ] and a second entanglement segment @xmath150 . in this",
    "an further examples not shown here , we have found that once a region of the @xmath139-space is found where the pertinent scenario is present , the values @xmath157 are quite stable with respect to changes in @xmath139 which are large with respect the temperature values .",
    "the inset of figure 3 shows this effect .",
    "moreover , the same eigenvectors used in fig . 3 , but with @xmath158 give @xmath159",
    ". + figure 4 shows the @xmath160 scenario ( cf .",
    "figure 1 for the two qubit system ) with four transitions : @xmath104 $ ] , and @xmath161 $ ] are separable segments alternating with entanglement segments @xmath107 and @xmath162 .",
    "we have introduced two characteristic temperatures @xmath62 and @xmath39 which organize the entanglement behaviour of the thermal state associated to any hamiltonian of an arbitrary composite system . for qubit / qubit and qubit / qutrit systems ,",
    "we have exemplified the possibility of various transitions from entanglement to separability as temperature increases from zero to @xmath39 , above which entanglement is impossible .",
    "one could expect that the features found here will persist and be enhanced as @xmath1 or @xmath17 increase ( although at present there is no manageable criterion to decide when a given state is entangled or not ) .",
    "thus , in general , there will be many separable temperature segments alternating with entangled ones for multipartite systems of higher dimensions .",
    "+ the main motivations for the present study came from certain problems posed in ref . @xcite . from that point of view ,",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn from our findings here are theoretical and concern the results briefly mentioned in  [ succ ] .",
    "it was asked in ref .",
    "@xcite : given a separable state @xmath12 which is not pure , does there exist a unitarily invariant , concave , continuous real - valued functional @xmath85 defined for the states of the composite system which isolates the trace and such that @xmath89 ? the answer given here is definitely no ! take any unentangled thermal state @xmath55 such that for some @xmath163 the gibbs state @xmath164 is entangled .",
    "then there can not exist an @xmath85 with @xmath165 because by wehrl s result ( cf .",
