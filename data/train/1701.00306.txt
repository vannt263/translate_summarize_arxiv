    "the famous yau - tian - donaldson s conjecture for the existence of khler - einstein metrics on fano manifolds asserts that the existence is equivalent to the k - stability .",
    "the conjecture has been recently solved by tian @xcite .",
    "chen , donaldson and sun also give an alternative proof @xcite .",
    "the notion of k - stability was first introduced by tian by using special degenerations @xcite and then reformulated by donaldson in algebraic geometry via test - configurations @xcite . for both special degenerations and test - configurations ,",
    "one has to study an infinite number of possible degenerations of the manifold .",
    "a natural question is how to verify the k - stability by reducing it to a finite dimensional progress .",
