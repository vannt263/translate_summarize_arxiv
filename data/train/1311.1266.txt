    "the last few years have witnessed an increasing interest within the scientific community in the study of the patterns displayed by networked systems such as social networks , the internet , the www and biological structures  @xcite .",
    "the study of social networks , for instance , has been useful to unveil many properties of collective interactions such as social influence  @xcite , disease spreading  @xcite and many other sociologic aspects .",
    "of particular interest to the aims of this study are the collaborative networks , which are among the largest social networks ever studied  @xcite .",
    "the main findings achieved with the modeling of social interactions as collaborative networks include the observation of non - trivial topological information such as the small - world phenomena  @xcite .",
    "this means that , similarly to random graph models  @xcite , the typical distance between nodes scales logarithmically with the number of agents in the system .",
    "another interesting pattern in the counterpart network , referred to as citation network  @xcite , is the cumulative behavior  @xcite , whereby papers referenced on many occasions tend to be cited again more intensely than other less referenced papers , thus reflecting the preferential attachment ( or richer - get - richer paradigm )  @xcite .",
    "collaborative networks have also been employed in information sciences to disambiguate authors names in scientific manuscripts  @xcite . among many reasons ,",
    "the accurate identification of authorship in manuscripts plays a fundamental role in the scientific community .",
    "for example , the quantification of researchers merit based on their publication profile might lead to unfair decisions regarding the distribution of project financing , awards and so forth , thus undermining the efficiency of the system as a whole . despite the many attempts to handle the task satisfactory  @xcite , a robust",
    ", precise system has not been conceived yet . for this reason , the disambiguation task remains an unsolved task for information sciences .",
    "traditional network methods for addressing the problem relies on the assumption that homonymous authors can be distinguished by examining the distinct patterns of collaboration  @xcite , because they often collaborate with different colleagues .",
    "unfortunately , some relevant network knowledge has been widely disregarded .",
    "for example , traditional approaches do not take into account the topological information of collaborative networks : patterns of connection with immediate neighbors have not been considered . in the same way ,",
    "the information concerning the global connectivity of authors in their scientific community have also been neglected . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the suitability of topological measurements as a complementary feature for the authors name disambiguation task through the more specifically , we show that the ability of discrimination is improved in three data sets with the proposed convex combination of classifiers . , which suggests that the long - range connectivity patterns plays a fundamental role in characterizing authors unequivocally .",
    "finally , we show that the weighing associated with the topological strategy can be obtained automatically with the discriminability obtained with the traditional approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ metodologia ] ,",
    "we detail the methodology employed to combine pattern recognition techniques . in the same section",
    ", we introduce the model based on collaborative networks and the topological features employed to characterize the organization of these networks . in section [ resultados ]",
    ", we display the results and discussions obtained with the proposed technique .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusao ] , .",
    "the discrimination of authors names can be defined as the ability to determine which individual authoring a document is behind an alias . to define the task ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of documents in a dataset .",
    "consider @xmath1 as the set of aliases ( authors names ) in @xmath1 and @xmath2 the set of authors .",
    "we aim at creating a mapping @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is not necessary an injective function .",
    "the mapping @xmath4 is supposed to assign more than one individual to each alias in a given document @xmath5 , although typically only one is chosen .",
    "names inaccuracies represent a major obstacle in processing and interpreting large of scientific papers for the purpose of grants and promotions . because many applications require data devoid of noise  @xcite , several methods have been developed to identify and remove ambiguities at the paper level .",
    "the simplest techniques are those based solely on authors names .",
    "these methods can either use the first or all initials to represent a persona  @xcite .",
    "more refined methods use additional information to perform the discrimination of ambiguous names .",
    "the most common complementary features currently employed are the list of references  @xcite , textual content  @xcite , crowd - sourced intelligence  @xcite , citation counts  @xcite , co - authors names  @xcite and publication venue title  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , even techniques borrowed from other research fields such as the use of stylometry features have been proposed to deal with ambiguities  @xcite .     of paramount importance to the purposes of the current study",
    "are the graph - based techniques , which basically  @xcite .",
    "the most traditional graph - based strategies assume that authors tend to maintain its collaboration group . as a consequence",
    ", distinct personas can be related to each other through the analysis of recurrence of neighbors  @xcite . in others",
    "words , if two personas share many neighbors ( collaborators ) in the collaborative network , then they probably are the same author .",
    "the above generalized to include not only immediate neighbors in the analysis , but also neighbors of neighbors and further hierarchies  @xcite .",
    "the reference  @xcite deals with a task related to the discrimination of homonymous authors .",
    "more specifically , they investigate how to find variations of authors names in publications .",
    "taking as premise the fact that authors tend to maintain a context ( e.g. co - authors names or words employed in paper titles ) , they perform an unsupervised classification . at the core of their method ,",
    "graph similarity measurements are combined with textual techniques to cluster distinct variations .",
    "an interesting contribution was proposed in  @xcite , which also employs a pre - processed collaborative network model devoid of invalid , redundant paths . upon using a similarity measurement inspired by the traditional electric circuit theory",
    ", they cluster ambiguous instances according to the affinity propagation criteria  @xcite . a different collaborative network is proposed in  @xcite .",
    "in such a network , nodes might represent either papers or authors .",
    "as for the edges , there is a twofold definition : they either connect authors sharing the same alias or papers and their respective authors . through the definition of a set of match functions , the proposed technique combines social network analysis with traditional similarity functions , yielding a significant improvement in the performance when compared with traditional techniques disregarding the network nature of scientific interactions .",
    "the use of topological measurements to was motivated by the use of similar strategies in the characterization of complex systems  @xcite . with well - defined collaborative groups or communities  @xcite . because , it is likely that nodes belonging to distinct communities will discriminate distinct authors .",
    "the strategies employed in this paper to disambiguate authors names are based in the construction of collaborative networks . in section [ netfom ]",
    "we show how collaborative networks representing the relationship between authors are built .",
    "then the nodes representing ambiguous names are characterized with traditional ( or collaborative ) features and with attributes extracted from topological measurements of complex networks ( cn )  @xcite ( see section [ caracterizacao ] ) .",
    "the methodology employed to combine both approaches in a hybrid strategy is then presented in section [ sec : fuzzy ] .      a network @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents the set of nodes and @xmath9 represents the set of edges . in a collaborative network , nodes represent authors .",
    "an edge exists between two authors if they published at least one paper together .",
    "each homonymous author is represented as a different node because .",
    "the strength of the link connecting nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the set comprising all papers in the database , @xmath14 represents the number of authors in paper @xmath15 and @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : formuladiego ] ) , @xmath14 is employed as a normalization factor to take into account the fact that the strength of links connecting a few authors tend to be more intense than those involving many authors  @xcite . .",
    "for this reason , each apparition ( persona ) is considered as a distinct node in the network ( see highlighted nodes ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : formuladiego ] ) , the strength @xmath17 of the edge linking aa1 and aa2 is 1/3 ( from paper 1 ) . in a similar fashion , @xmath18 ,",
    "i.e. , 1/3 ( from paper 1 ) plus 1/3 ( from paper 3 ) .",
    ".[tabela1]authorship in a toy dataset comprising 7 papers .",
    "names ( n ) represent the list of names as it appears in the paper .",
