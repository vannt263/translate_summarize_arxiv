    "the quantum discord ( @xmath6 ) which measures a more general type of quantum correlation , is found to have nonzero values even for separable mixed states @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 is built on the fact that two classical equivalent ways of defining the mutual information turn out to be inequivalent in the quantum domain .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is responsible for the quantum computational efficiency of deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit @xcite albeit in the absence of entanglement .    in recent years",
    ", the @xmath6 has been intensively investigated in the literature both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "generally , it is somewhat difficult to calculate @xmath6 and the analytical solutions can hardly be obtained except for some particular cases , such as the so - called @xmath7 states @xcite .",
    "some researches show that @xmath6 , concurrence ( @xmath4 ) and classical correlation ( @xmath5 ) are respectively independent measures of correlations with no simple relative ordering and @xmath6 is more practical than entanglement @xcite .",

    "the authors investigated the effect of dzyaloshinski  moriya ( dm ) interaction,@xcite which arises from spin - orbit coupling , on qd in an anisotropic xxz model and shown that with the increase of the dm interaction the qd gradually reduces at finite temperature .",
    "the effect of dm interaction on qd in heisenberg xy model has also been discussed in ref.@xcite , in which the authors showed that qd can describe more information about quantum correlation than quantum entanglement .",
    "there are interesting papers discussing the qd qualitatively and quantitatively in heisenberg spin chain models with various factors such as temperature , anisotropies and magnetic field.@xcite in this letter , we study the qd , cc and @xmath4 in an anisotropic heisenberg xyz model with the dm interaction both in the thermal equilibrium case and the intrinsic decoherence case , and discuss how the dm interaction influence the correlations in such a system . the present study of the correlations in heisenberg spin chain model will help us to understand the effect of dm interaction on the correlations and the phase decoherence resistance of the correlations more comprehensively .",

    "the quantum generalization of the conditional entropy is not the simply replacement of shannon entropy with von neumann entropy , but through the process of projective measurement on the subsystem @xmath38 by a set of complete projectors @xmath39 , with the outcomes labeled by @xmath40 , then the conditional density matrix @xmath41 becomes @xmath42 which is the locally post - measurement state of the subsystem @xmath38 after obtaining the outcome @xmath40 on the subsystem @xmath43 with the probability @xmath44 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the identity operator on the subsystem @xmath43 .",

    "1(a ) shows that in the case of the temperature @xmath58 with finite value , @xmath70 increases monotonously with the increasing of @xmath3 , by which one can also achieve maximum entanglement even at finite low temperatures .",
    "both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are zero when the temperature is zero , which is totally different from the case of @xmath70 ( it takes the maximum in this case ) .",
    "but there is an apparent increase , which is sharper for larger @xmath3 , followed by a gradual decrease when the temperature is increased gradually starting from zero .",
    "more interestingly , the @xmath71 and @xmath72 show the same characteristics in their behavior following the increasing of the absolute value of @xmath3 , which is different from the entanglement .",
    "the saddle - like structure of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in this case reveals the constructive role of @xmath3 for the two correlations , one quantum , one classical , which is one of the interesting results of this work .",
    "all of the above three correlations do not undergo sudden death , instead , they tend asymptotically towards zero as the temperature is increased .    in the overall ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath3 is an efficient parameter in increasing various correlations such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 at finite temperature .",
    "this is partly contrary to the result for the case of xxz model , in which the increase of the @xmath1 interaction suppresses the @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath6 shows a different behavior from the @xmath4 in the response to the variation of @xmath1 interaction .",
    "now , we take the influence of intrinsic decoherence on the various correlations into account . according to the milburn s equation @xcite followed by the assumption that a system does not evolve continuously under unitary transformation for sufficiently short time steps , the master equation for pure phase decoherence",
    "is given by @xmath73 - \\frac{1}{2\\gamma } [ h,[h,\\rho(t)]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the phase decoherence rate .",
    "in the limit @xmath75 the schodinger@xmath76s equation is recovered .",
    "the formal solution of the master equation above can be given by @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the density operator of the initial system and @xmath79 is defined by @xmath80 by inserting the completeness relation @xmath81 of the energy eigenstate into master equation @xcite , we can write the explicit expression of the density matrix of the states as @xmath82 \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath83 we assume that the system is initially prepared in the bell state @xmath84 . from the eq . ( 16 ) , the time evolution for this initial state can be obtained as @xmath85 where the elements of the matrix can be defined as @xmath86}{\\mu^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath87}{2(j_x+j_y-2id_z)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath88}{2(j_x+j_y+2id_z)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath89}{\\mu^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath90     with the system parameters fixed as @xmath13=0.03 , @xmath14=0.06 , @xmath91 and @xmath3=6 .",
    "the upper part of the figure is the concurrence ( black line ) , quantum discord ( blue line ) , classical correlation ( red line ) versus time @xmath92 with the system parameters fixed as @xmath13=3 , @xmath14=0.6 , @xmath93 and @xmath3=0.1 ( dotted line ) , @xmath3=0.3 ( thin line).,width=302,height=226 ]    in order to highlight the effect of the pase decoherence @xmath74 on the various correlations , we plot the time evolutions of correlations with different values of @xmath3 in fig.2 .",
    "it can be seen from the lower part of the figure that the time evolution of the entanglement and quantum discord exhibit the interesting phenomena of `` sudden death '' and `` sudden revival'',@xcite which occur when the spin - orbit coupling is large and spin - spin coupling is small .",
    "secondly , with the aim to clarify the joint influence of the system parameters with the phase decoherence on the time evolution , the combination of the system parameters for the upper part of the figure is chosen as the optimum one based on the numerical analysis .",
    "all of the three correlations exhibit oscillatory behavior , which ultimately ends with a steady state value .",
    "oscillations are suppressed obviously with the increase of @xmath74 .",
    "the cc ends with the maximum value , while the other two end with a smaller steady state value with respect to the starting maximum value .",
    "importantly , the final steady state values of the entanglement and quantum discord are all still high despite the phase decoherence , implying that the optimum combination of the system parameters can keep the correlations highly immune to the pure phase decoherence .",
    "moreover , one can see that the quantum discord is more fragile under the phase decoherence than the entanglement , which is different from the result that it is more resistant against the environment than entanglement .",
    "last but not least , the larger the dm interaction , the severer the collapse of the correlations , which is the opposite of the thermal case .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the various correlations , particularly the quantum discord in an anisotropic two - qubit heisenberg xyz model with the presence of dm interaction .",
    "results are presented both for the case at thermal equilibrium and under phase decoherence and they show that the roles of the dm interactions in controlling the thermal quantum discord are opposite to the case of the xxz . it is found constructive in the case of xyz model under our consideration . however , this is not the same story for the case of phase decoherence , where the dm becomes destructive .",
    "the time evolution of the entanglement and quantum discord shows the famous phenomena of collapse and revival .",
    "though the quantum discord is shown to be more sensitive to the phase decoherence than the entanglement , optimum combination of the system parameters can protect the correlations effectively against the influence of the phase decoherence on the whole .",
