    "dusty debris disks that surround nearby main - sequence stars were first detected by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( ) in 1983 .",
    "these circumstellar disks were inferred from an infrared excess flux between 25 and 100@xmath0 many times brighter than expected from the stellar photosphere .",
    "the ir excess was modeled by disk distributions that would absorb optical and ultraviolet flux from the host star and then isotropically radiate this energy at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the first dusty debris disk was discovered around the bright main - sequence star vega @xcite ; consequently a dusty disk around a main - sequence star is commonly referred to as the vega phenomenon .",
    "numerous studies of t tauri stars dating back many years indicate the characteristic timescale for the dispersal of a surrounding dusty , gaseous disk is a few million years . following dissipation of the gaseous component ,",
    "the remaining dust can further dissipate during the following few million years via coagulation into large objects , poynting - robertson and stellar wind drag , radiation pressure , and collisional destruction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "vega - like stars are , however , generally much older than 10 myr , thus the observed dust should be of secondary origin , most likely replenished via collision and fragmentation of planetesimals .",
    "furthermore , the vega - phenomenon overlaps with the important planetary system formation epochs in our solar system : giant gas planet formation within @xmath110 myr , terrestrial planet formation within @xmath130 myr , and the era of heavy bombardment in the inner solar system within @xmath1600 myr .",
    "therefore , studies of ir - excess stars can provide crucial information on extrasolar planetary formation and evolution .    during the past two decades",
    ", about two dozen papers have been published that describe , infrared space observatory ( ) , and _ space telescope _ searches for stars with excess ir emission ( @xmath2  3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these searches employed different techniques for cross - correlating ir and stellar sources with no consistent definition of an ir excess . to date , several hundred main - sequence ir - excess stars have been reported in the literature including those that have an ir excess at 25@xmath0 .",
    "a major goal of debris disk research has been to characterize the temporal evolution of the quantity of dust present in the disks .",
    "notwithstanding almost two decades of debris disk research using data from three ir satellites , a convincing assessment of this temporal evolution remains incomplete .",
    "such an assessment requires a large sample of stars and a reliable estimate of the dust mass and the age for each debris disk system .",
    "false positive ir - excess stars due to the large beam size of and improper search or calibration techniques have contaminated some previous studies .",
    "such contamination of the debris disk population has not only plagued many follow - up observations from ground and/or space observatories but also precludes a global assessment of the distribution and evolution of the dust population .",
    "if the ir excess is from a bona fide dust disk , then the best estimator of dust mass comes from submillimeter flux .",
    "unfortunately , submillimeter flux measurements are difficult , time - intensive observations .",
    "a more readily accessible observable is @xmath3 , the ratio of excess infrared luminosity due to dust divided by the total energy output from a star .",
    "we compute values of @xmath3 for each of the ir - excess stars presented in this paper . in @xmath2  5.1",
    "we discuss the relationship between submillimeter flux and @xmath3 for those vega - like stars for which both are known , and we derive our own relationship , which is used to predict a dust mass if both @xmath3 and the dust disk radius are known .",
    "furthermore , estimation of stellar age is often troublesome since most nearby ir - excess stars are isolated field stars . in order to obviate the shortcoming of stellar age estimation , several groups are using to search for ir - excess stars in nearby young stellar groups with well - determined ages ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , because the distance to all rich clusters is substantial ( except for the hyades ) , it remains difficult to obtain statistically significant results even with @xcite .",
    "thus , the large , clean sample of relatively nearby field stars we discuss in the present paper can contribute in a statistically meaningful way to our understanding of the vega phenomenon and its evolution with time .",
    "zuckerman & song ( 2004a , hereafter paper i ) , relying primarily on data in silverstone s ( 2000 ) thesis , analyzed 58 strong ir - excess stars following careful checks against possible contamination from various sources .",
    "zuckerman & song argued that the vega - like stars are signposts for the existence of planets and focused their efforts on identifying stars that would make the best targets for adaptive optics and precision radial velocity searches .",
    "the present paper extends the sample analyzed in paper i in a couple of ways .",
    "first , we significantly increase the sample size so that it is now possible to address circumstellar dusty disk evolution in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "this increase is achieved by systematically cross - correlating all main - sequence stars with 60@xmath0 sources in the faint source ( fsc ) and point source ( psc ) catalogs .",
    "our distance limit is 120 pc compared with the 100 pc adopted in paper i. second , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting routine was enhanced with the employment of filter response functions and a fully automated fit with a @xmath4 minimization method .    and",
    "data were cross - correlated to search for ir - excess stars .",
    "many sources in the fsc and psc with optical stellar identifications are , however , giant stars @xcite . a constraint on the absolute visual magnitude @xmath5 @xmath6 6.0 ( ) - 2.0 ( fig .",
    "[ hipms ] ) was applied to the entire 118,218 stars of the catalog to remove giant stars from our sample .",
    "this cut eliminated 50,164 stars , leaving 68,054 stars for further investigation .",
    "these pre - screened dwarfs were then cross - correlated against sources .",
    "the fsc was used to cross - correlate the 53,157 stars located out of the galactic plane ( @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , while the psc was used for the 14,897 stars in the galactic plane and to recover any object missed by the fsc out of the galactic plane .",
    "all fsc sources with a detection at 60@xmath0 ( i.e. a 60@xmath0 flux quality of 2 or 3 ) and a dwarf within 45@xmath10 were selected for further investigation .",
    "a search radius of 45@xmath10 was adopted to reflect the average fsc 3  @xmath11 positional error . for psc sources in the galactic plane , dwarfs within only a 10@xmath10 search radius were retained , in order to avoid contamination of spurious sources in the crowded fields of the galactic plane .",
    "there were 557 stars ( 481 from the fsc and 76 from the psc ) that passed the initial cross - correlation .",
    "unfortunately , the fsc is only @xmath180% complete .",
    "we therefore cross - correlated all main - sequence stars outside the galactic plane with the psc using a search radius of 45@xmath10 .",
    "we found an additional 65 stars in the psc that had 60@xmath0 detections , but were unidentified in the fsc .",
    "most of these stars from the psc were detected at 12@xmath0 ( but not 60@xmath0 ) in the fsc .",
    "in contrast , @xcite cross - correlated and fsc sources only .",
    "our correlation with the fsc and psc left a collection of 622 main - sequence stars identified in the catalog that had 60@xmath0 counterparts detected by .    in young and massive main - sequence stars ,",
    "significant ir flux arises from free - free emission .",
    "such stars , namely spectral types o1-b5 , were excluded from our sample by rejection of objects with @xmath12 @xmath13 -0.15 .",
    "then a distance cut of 120 pc was applied to our sample to avoid contaminations arising from star - forming regions and interstellar cirrus as described , for example , in @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "a visual inspection of the remaining excess candidates for the presence of a background galaxy was conducted by correlating the fsc and psc catalogs with nasa s extragalactic database ( ned ) in digital sky survey ( dss ) images .",
    "any star with a noticeable galaxy within the 3@xmath11 positional error ellipse was removed from our sample , and any star with a bright star within the 3@xmath11 error ellipse was flagged for further checking of its sed . since ned is not complete , we also carefully checked any dss optical extended sources ( mainly galaxies ) that were not included in ned . using the long format of the fsc catalog ,",
    "@xcite compared the 60@xmath0 position to the stellar position and excluded stars whose 60@xmath0 offsets are @xmath830 . instead of imposing such a strict constraint on our sample ,",
    "we exclude stars only if their 60@xmath0 offsets are greater than the 3 @xmath11 positional error .",
    "for all fsc sources , we carefully checked their 60@xmath0 positions against any galaxy or bright nearby star .    for stars with apparent detections in the 100@xmath0 band",
    ", we tested for possible contamination from interstellar cirrus .",
    "some relatively distant , previously known , ir - excess candidates are contaminated by interstellar cirrus @xcite .",
    "we checked the cirrus flag of all 100@xmath0 sources and rejected those with cirrus flag @xmath8 3 except hip 77542 .",
    "hip 77542 had significant excess at all wavelengths and was fit nicely with a single blackbody temperature ( paper i ) .",
    "a fully automated sed fitting technique using a theoretical atmospheric model @xcite was used to predict stellar photospheric fluxes .",
    "this fit technique is unlike previous excess searches that use the `` empirical '' color of main sequence stars to estimate stellar photospheric fluxes . for each star , fluxes at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 were employed to fit the model spectra of a stellar photosphere . the standard johnson @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes",
    "were obtained by converting tycho @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes using table  2 in @xcite .",
    "for the 10 objects that did not have observed tycho @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 values were obtained from simbad . observed @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 magnitudes came from the 2mass catalog . when any star was brighter than 5th magnitude at @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 in 2mass , we set its uncertainty to 0.400 mag . the zero magnitudes in @xcite",
    "were used to convert the observed magnitudes into a flux density ( janskys ) .",
    "the current hauschildt et al .",
    "stellar photosphere model ( t. barman 2004 , private communication ) is available for effective temperatures from 1700 to 10,000  k ( in 100  k increments from 1700 to 3000  k and in 200  k increments from 3000 to 10,000  k ) .",
    "the stellar radius and effective temperature were used as free parameters to fit the observed fluxes with a @xmath4 minimization method .",
    "we created model fluxes at each band by convolving each filter function with the model spectra .",
    "this method provides a more accurate representation of the observed flux especially where the passband includes significant spectral features such as the balmer jump . comparing the best - fit model spectra with the observed fluxes",
    ", we found that the model spectra always overestimated the @xmath14- and @xmath15-band fluxes .",
    "this perhaps arises from some missing opacity sources in the @xmath14- and @xmath15-bands of the model spectra . for consistency",
    ", we manually set the uncertainties of @xmath14 and @xmath15-band magnitudes to 0.25 if the given uncertainty value is smaller than 0.25 mag to ensure a better fit .",
    "once the stellar photosphere was modeled , a dust component was fit with a blackbody curve .",
    "upper limits were not included in the dust fitting , but we mandated that the upper limits are always above the estimated total ( star and dust ) flux .",
    "temperature dependent color corrections should be carefully considered .",
    "both the stellar photosphere and dust emission contribute to the observed flux as follows ;    @xmath19    where the subscript `` unc '' stands for `` uncorrected . ''",
    "thus , accurate estimation of a color correction value requires not only the flux of the stellar photosphere but also that of the dust , which is obtained through the blackbody fitting .",
    "but the problem is that both dust flux and the color correction are a function of dust temperature , which requires an iterative process to determine the dust temperature in color - corrected dust flux .",
    "instead we obtained the dust temperature by fitting the uncorrected fluxes .",
    "first , we `` colored '' the stellar photosphere ( eq . [ 2 ] ) by multiplying the appropriate color correction terms ( @xmath20 ) before subtracting the stellar photosphere ( eq . [ 3 ] ) :    @xmath21    @xmath22    , where the subscript @xmath23 stands for `` model . ''",
    "then we fit the remaining fluxes with the `` colored '' blackbody curve ( eq . [ 4 ] ) ,    @xmath24    by combining equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) and using the stellar photosphere model described above , we obtained the best - fit temperatures of the stellar and dust emission",
    ". then the correct total color correction terms were calculated by estimating the fractional color terms using a weighted average of photosphere and dust fluxes at each wavelength ( eq . [ 5 ] ) :    @xmath25    where c@xmath26 and c@xmath27 are the fractional contributions of the stellar photosphere and dust to the total measured flux , @xmath28    in displaying the observed magnitudes , we applied the prorated color correction terms to the measurements ( eq .",
    "[ 6 ] ) . as in photosphere fitting , we created synthetic fluxes at each band by convolving filter functions with the blackbody curve .",
    "sed fits were performed for all identified and stars , yielding very precise estimation of stellar photospheric fluxes ( fig . set 2 ) .",
    "when available , additional fluxes from and/or _ _ spitzer _ _  3 . ]",
    "measurements were used to better fit dust components .",
    "four objects were dropped from our list due to possible cirrus contamination or no 60@xmath0 excess based on measurements reported in @xcite except hip 111278 .",
    "for some objects , multiband imaging photometer for ( mips ) data are available in the public archive but were not yet published . in such cases , we extracted photometry from mips pipeline data at 24 and 70@xmath0 .",
    "no photometry was attempted on mips 160@xmath0 pipeline data because of heavy contamination from a known `` blue leak . ''",
    "several class i and ii pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars were found from our sed fits , in which a typical sed of a class i / ii pms star shows large @xmath14 and @xmath15 fluxes above the model spectrum and strong but flat excess in the ir . because we are searching for ir excess among main - sequence stars , class i and ii pms stars were subsequently eliminated from our sample . for completeness , the -identified class i & ii pms stars within 120 pc are listed in table  1 .",
    "many sources that passed the visual check , especially nearby stars , showed no ir excess in their sed .",
    "color corrected fluxes were compared to the estimated photospheric fluxes .",
    "stars with no ir excess ( [ f@xmath29 - f@xmath30 / @xmath31 @xmath13 2.5 ) were eliminated except hip  71284 , where @xmath31 is the 60@xmath0 flux density uncertainty .",
    "ir excess at hip  71284 was confirmed by an observation ( paper i ) .",
    "one hundred forty - six stars had ir excess ( [ f@xmath29 - f@xmath30 / @xmath31 @xmath8 3.0 ) , and nine stars showed marginal ir excess ( 2.5 @xmath13 [ f@xmath29 - f@xmath30/ @xmath31 @xmath13 3.0 ) .",
    "these marginal ir excess stars fall into a statistical domain in which @xmath10.5% of non - excess stars may produce a false excess assuming gaussian noise under _ pure statistical detection errors_. recent observations show that three stars ( hip  65109 , hip  105090 , & hip  105858 ) that had marginal ir excess from are not ir - excess stars .",
    "in addition , even some stars with [ f@xmath29 - f@xmath30 / @xmath31 @xmath83.0 turn out to be false positives .",
    "for example , hip  83137 , passing all the tests above , had [ f@xmath29 - f@xmath30 / @xmath31 = 4.3 and was considered one of the better new ir - excess candidates .",
    "however , recent mips observations found no excess emission at 70@xmath32 at hip  83137 along with six other similar stars ( hip  8102 , hip  42913 , hip  49641 , hip  75118 , hip  98025 , & hip  104206 ) .",
    "all six bogus excess stars had excess emission detected at 60@xmath0 only",

    ", we anticipate that about 15 objects or 10% ( 15/146 ) of our sample may turn out as non - excess stars .",
    "generally , a bogus excess can be produced in two quite different ways .",
    "one way is where a real , background , far - ir source is present in the beam when pointed toward a star .",
    "the other is where a 3@xmath11 noise bump happens to fall near a star .",
    "apparent excess sources rejected for both classes of reasons are listed in table a4 .",
    "the number of real background sources ( mostly galaxies ) anticipated in our sample can be estimated in a way analogous to that described in section 2 of @xcite ; such an estimate agrees reasonably with the number of background galaxies listed in table a4 .",
    "if the background noise has a normal distribution , then we anticipate that about one star in 500 could be contaminated by a 3.1@xmath11 noise fluctuation .",
    "after our distance and color cuts described above , we were left with @xmath125,800 dwarfs .",
    "thus , of these , @xmath150 might be contaminated by a noise fluctuation .",
    "some constraint is supplied by examination of scanpi traces which sometimes show the 60@xmath0 peak position to be displaced from the stellar position .",
    "background noise could be responsible , in total , for @xmath120 stars listed in table  a4 .",
    "nearby m - type stars are now known not to be strong ir - excess sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , indeed the only one listed in table 2 is au  mic which is a very young star .",
    "there are @xmath1900 m - type dwarf stars in the catalog and the only one other than au mic that appeared in our cross correlation with was ax  mic , in which , however , a mips observation showed that there is no 70@xmath0 excess .",
    "according to the above estimates , we might have expected two bogus associations in these 900 stars , in reasonable agreement with the one , ax  mic that was actually found .",
    "we finally present 146 identified ir - excess dwarfs in this paper . among them",
    "33 stars are newly identified as ir - excess stars from our survey , and only two objects out of these 33 newly identified ir - excess stars have marginal ir - excess ( 2.5 @xmath13 [ f@xmath29 - f@xmath30 / @xmath31 @xmath13 3.0 ) .",
    "comparison of with and demonstrates the power of all - sky surveys . notwithstanding that flew more than 20 years ago , through careful analysis of its database , we have been able to discover perhaps as many as 33 main - sequence stars with previously unrecognized dusty debris disks detected at 60@xmath0 wavelength .",
    "in comparison , only 22 new 60@xmath0 excess stars were discovered in all programs while @xmath120 new 70@xmath0 excess stars were announced in the 2004 and 2005 _ spitzer_-based literature ( see below for references ) .",
    "although and have higher sensitivities than , they are both pointed satellites with a much smaller sky coverage",
    ".    surveys and , significantly , some of their limitations are summarized in @xmath2  1 of the present paper and in @xmath2  3 of @xcite .",
    "previous to the present study , @xcite represented the most comprehensive search of the catalogs for vega - like 60@xmath0 excess stars .",
    "however , silverstone s primary goal was to use to detect dust at f- and g - type stars inconclusively detected by at 60@xmath0 .",
    "he did not analyze his findings , and his search never reached publication .",
    "thus , no survey published prior to 2005 is germane to issues addressed in the present paper .",
    "was a pointed satellite of modest sensitivity , and surveys by various groups added relatively few new vega - like stars .",
    "@xcite give a comprehensive account of these surveys , a major goal of which was characterization of the time dependence of the vega phenomenon .",
    "one limitation of these studies , as noted by decin et al .",
    ", is the quite uncertain ages of many of the excess stars .",
    "indeed , we disagree with some of the ages in table  1 of decin et al .",
    "they describe some limitations to the results presented by @xcite , limitations due , in part , to the poorer than expected sensitivity of .",
    "a next advance was by @xcite , who focused on deducing the lifetimes and temporal evolution of the dust around the vega - like stars . in an innovative analysis , they considered the relative sky - plane velocity dispersions of the vega - like stars and of stars in general to demonstrate that , at any given spectral type , the vega - like stars are , on average , younger than the general population of field stars .",
    "they also showed that the average @xmath3 of the vega - like stars declines with increasing velocity dispersion , that is , with increasing age .",
    "because their analysis technique is very different from our s and because their sample of excess stars is not called out explicitly in their paper , it is not possible to make a direct comparison between their results and ours .",
    "however , wherever their conclusions and ours do overlap , they appear to be consistent .",
    "most recently , @xcite compiled a list of 60 debris disks with high fractional dust luminosity , @xmath33 , and within 120 pc of earth by searching the and database .",
    "forty - eight objects in moor et al .",
    "are included in our survey , while 12 objects are absent . among those 12 objects missing ,",
    "four are not stars , and six of eight stars did not have a detection at 60@xmath0 with and , therefore , did not satisfy our search criteria ( @xmath2  2 ) . the remaining two , hd  121812 ( hip  68160 ) and hd  122106 ( hip  68380 ) , are rejected in the present paper due to possible cirrus contamination and the presence of a nearby galaxy , respectively ( see table  a4 for the list of rejected sources ) . we included five objects ( hip  13005 , hip  25790 , hip  69682 , hip  77163 , and hip  83480 ) from the moor et al .",

    "by contrast , three teams @xcite investigated the temporal evolution of the dust using the database .",
    "all three studies suffer to some degree from small numbers of detected sources or uncertain / incorrect stellar ages or both .",
    "@xcite noticed that there are few young stars with @xmath44 , which also appears in our figure 4 .",
    "this rarity of young low @xmath3 stars may be due to the fact that there are not many young early - type stars in the solar vicinity ( say @xmath45 50 pc ) .",
    "we can roughly quantify item ( 2 ) by dividing the stars into three age bins , ( a ) 10 - 50 myr , ( a ) @xmath850 - 500 myr , and ( c ) @xmath8500 - 5000 myr .",
    "we assume that , in a given volume of space near earth , stars are uniformly distributed in age for ages up to @xmath11 gyr . for older stars one first loses all main - sequence a - type stars -",

    ", the age bin ( b ) contains 10 times more stars in total  with and without a dusty disk  than does bin ( a ) . since bin ( b ) in figure [ age ] contains about 2.8 times the number of vega - like stars as does bin ( a ) , the probability that a star will be vega - like is @xmath13.5 times greater between ages of 10 and 50 myr than between 50 and 500 myr .",
    "similarly , we can estimate the probability that a star in age bin ( c ) will be vega - like .",
    "we ignore for just a moment the loss of a - and f- type stars in bin ( c ) as a result of evolution off the main sequence . in that case , because bin ( c ) contains 10 times more stars in total - with and without a dusty disk  than does bin ( b ) but fewer vega - like stars ( 24 vs. 74 ) , the probability that a star will be vega - like in age bin ( b ) would be @xmath130 times greater than in bin ( c ) .",
    "however , because there is a sequential loss of a- and f - type main - sequence stars at ages @xmath8 1 gyr , and because these spectral types dominate the detected 60@xmath0 excess stars , we estimate that if a star has an age appropriate for bin ( b ) , then the probability of its being vega - like is only @xmath110 times ( rather than 30 times ) greater than the probability of being vega - like if its age falls in that of bin ( b ) .",
    "then the probability of any given nearby star in age bin ( a ) being vega - like is @xmath135 times greater than this probability is in bin ( c ) .",
    "the preceding discussion pertains to how the probability of being vega - like declines with age .",
    "we can estimate the absolute value of this probability in two ways .",
    "first , two stars in table  2 are members of the hyades ( figure 2 : hip 18975 = vb 160 and hip 20635 = vb 54 ) although both have cautionary notes and the 60@xmath0 excesses can not be regarded as definite until confirmed with additional data .",
    "could have detected excess 60@xmath0 emission comparable to @xmath3 = @xmath46 at hyades stars with v @xmath45 6 , which corresponds to a mid - f- type star . according to table  1 in @xcite ,",
    "40 hyades members have a @xmath15 mag brighter than 6 .",
    "thus , at an age of 600 myr , @xmath475% of a- through mid - f- type stars in the hyades are vega - like above the 60@xmath0 flux level accessible to .",
    "detection of hyades member hip 20261 , but at a flux level , 50 mjy , below the detection limit . ] .",
    "field a - type stars supply a second sample to estimate the probability that a star will show the vega - phenomenon .",
    "we find , in essential agreement with some previous determinations , that detected 60 @xmath0 excess emission at @xmath120% of a - type stars with @xmath3 @xmath8 @xmath42 out to 28 pc ( 10 of 50 stars ) and with @xmath3 @xmath8 4 @xmath48 out to 40 pc ( 22 of 119 stars ) .",
    "the percentage of f - type stars that show the vega phenomenon at comparable levels of @xmath3 appears to be noticeably smaller , but definitive statistics should wait for results from _",
    "spitzer_.    notwithstanding the much larger probability of a star being vega - like at young ages , there appears to be very little distinction with age in peak @xmath3 seen in figure [ age ] and noted in item ( 1 ) above .",
    "this suggests that the vega - phenomenon , at least at the higher levels of @xmath3 measured by , may be mostly the result of occasional large and violent collisional events rather than many small - scale , dust - producing events added together . for example , there was a very substantial and recent collisional event at the g - type main - sequence star bd + 20 307 , first detected by at 12 and 25@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "item ( 4 ) noted above might be anticipated in a collisional cascade model ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "in such a model , collisions grind dust particles down to smaller and smaller sizes until sufficiently small particles are blown out of the system by radiation pressure from the star .",
    "lower luminosity , later type stars will retain more small particles in orbit that in total can possess a large emitting area ; thus @xmath3 is increased .",
    "the larger @xmath3 expected for late - type stars in a @xcite model is illustrated in their figure 1__f__. earlier , @xcite had suggested that late - type stars display larger @xmath3 than early - type stars based on the limited data available to him at that time .",
    "perhaps the quantities of most interest are disk dust mass , disk radial extent , and disk evolution with time .",
    "the total mass ( _ m _ ) of dust in a disk may be written : @xmath49 where _ n _ is the total number of grains in the disk and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the density and radius of a typical grain .",
    "for an optically thin dusty ring / shell of characteristic radius _",
    ", @xmath52 then , @xmath53 thus , if characteristic grain size and density do not vary much among various optically thin dust disks , then one expects @xmath3/_m _ to vary as the inverse square power of the disk radius , _",
    "r_. figure [ taumdr ] shows this to be approximately the case for dust disks with semimajor axes between 10 and 100 au , where we have taken @xmath3 and _ r _ from table  2 , and disk mass from the submillimeter literature .",
    "the significance of the filled and open symbols in figure 5 is as follows .",
    "the figure was initially prepared containing only the filled symbols that represent dust mass determinations based on submillimeter data published prior to 2006 .",
    "the dashed line was deemed a reasonable @xmath54 `` fit '' to these solid symbols and we used it to derive disk dust masses for many stars in table  2 as outlined below .",
    "then , while the present paper was being refereed , a paper presenting submillimeter measured masses for six table  2 stars appeared ( hd 14055 , 15115 , 21997 , 127821 , 206893 , and 218396 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these six stars appear in our figure 5 as open symbols , and because they lie along the dashed line , they clearly indicate the viability of our method .    while recognizing a caveat of statistics of small numbers , relative to the dashed line the early - type stars preferentially lie somewhat above the later type stars .",
    "this difference could be attributed to smaller grains around the later - type stars ( as discussed in @xmath2 5 ) . however",
    ", this model requires that these grains are sufficiently small that they are unable to radiate like blackbodies at their temperature and thus , at a given distance from the star , are hotter than blackbody grains would be at that same distance .",
    "rather few stars appear in figure 5 as a direct consequence of the limited number of published measurements of submillimeter fluxes for vega - like stars .",
    "in addition , we plot only stars for which far - ir excess emission has been measured in at least two wavelengths ; for such stars we can estimate @xmath37 and , thus , @xmath39 .    because @xmath3 is easier to measure ( especially with ) than is a submillimeter flux , we use figure [ taumdr ] to derive initial estimates of dust masses for many stars listed in column ( 12 ) of table  2 . combining , and data , all stars with masses listed in table  2 and plotted in figure 6 have measured excess ir emission in at least two wavelengths . as mentioned in @xmath2  4 above and emphasized in paper i , the method used to calculate the values of r@xmath55 listed in table  2 will sometimes substantially underestimate the true r@xmath55 .",
    "thus , the table  2 dust mass estimates should be regarded with some caution .",
    "the filled symbols in figure [ md_age ] indicate a dust mass measurement at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "we expect that stars plotted with ages @xmath45 10 myr still retain significant amounts of orbiting primordial dust left over from the star formation process .",
    "thus , when considering the evolution of disk masses in dust , these stars should not be compared with the older stars whose dust is of a second generation .",
    "figure [ taumdr ] in @xcite , based solely on submillimeter data , is suggestive of dust mass decreasing with time .",
    "however , when stars with ages @xmath45 10 myr are omitted , the remaining submillimeter data are consistent with constant average dust mass at stars with ages between 30 and 1000 myr , as suggested by our simple model from figure 5 , and the resulting open points are plotted in figure 6 .",
    "@xcite consider in some detail planet formation models of kenyon & bromley ( 2004a,2004b ) .",
    "according to the discussion in najita & williams , in these models a wave of planet formation in the disk propagates outward generating , as time progresses , dusty debris at successively larger characteristic radii . according to the models , for times perhaps as long as 1  gyr , the total mass in small grains sensibly remains constant , while , in contrast , the reprocessed luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) emitted by the collisional debris begins to decline at a much earlier time ( @xmath45 10 myr ) .",
    "this is because , as the wave of planet formation moves outward , grains of a given size subtend increasingly smaller solid angles the farther they are located from the star . comparing our results ( fig . 4 and 7 ) with these models , both a decrease in @xmath3 and an increase in r appears plausible between 10 and 1000 myr .",
    "figure [ tau_au ] is a plot of @xmath3 versus disk radius .",
    "the six stars with @xmath3 @xmath8 10@xmath56 all have estimated ages of @xmath45 20 myr .",
    "thus , much of their dust may be a remnant of the star formation process , rather than second generational .",
    "for the other stars , no correlation is apparent between @xmath3 and _ r_. although a grain of a given radius located close to a star will absorb more stellar radiation than one far away , the lifetime of close - in grains might be shorter than for distant grains , and these two effects may roughly cancel , on average .",
    "an algol is a binary in which the less massive stellar component fills its roche lobe and the other , which does not , is not degenerate @xcite .",
    "four stars in table  2 are eclipsing binaries of the algol type , including algol a itself .",
    "hip 76267 was long ago recognized as a 60@xmath0 excess star @xcite .",
    "the @xcite survey at 24@xmath0 included three algols . for hip 76267 , they report a just - significant , 29% , excess according to their criteria ( the measured flux must be @xmath8 1.25 times the expected photosphere to be regarded as significant ) .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "also report a 7% excess at 24@xmath0 for algol a , although this does not meet their significance threshold of 25% .",
    "for hd  40183 their measured 24@xmath0 flux was only 0.88 times the expected photosphere .",
    "although the fsc reports detection of hd 40183 at 12 , 25 , and 60@xmath0 , we see no evidence of an excess at any wavelength .",
    "the far - ir excess emission at the four algols might be generated by free - free and bound - free transitions in ionized gas or by cool dust or both .",
    "the algol - type binary stars are susceptible to emission in ionized gas because a small h ii region is created around the primary star by material transferred from the secondary star .",
    "we first consider far - ir emission in an ionized gas disk orbiting a late b - type primary in algols listed in table  3 .",
    "we assume an electron density n@xmath57 = @xmath58 cm@xmath56 and disk radius r = @xmath60 cm @xcite . @xcite",
    "give the flux between 0 and 1100    received at earth for the b7 star @xmath61  leo .",
    "this translates to @xmath1@xmath62 photons s@xmath63 emitted by @xmath61  leo and capable of ionizing hydrogen .",
    "the excitation parameter ( _ e _ ) , i.e. the number of photons per second required to maintain an  region , is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "with @xmath65 = 2 @xmath66 10@xmath67 @xmath68 s@xmath63 at 10,000 k , and e = 2 @xmath69 ionizing photons s@xmath63 , an  region with n@xmath57 = @xmath58 cm@xmath56 and _ r _ = @xmath60 cm can be supported .",
    "considering the four algols with seds displayed in figure 9 , we assume a characteristic distance of 30 pc and a characteristic excess flux at 60@xmath0 equal to 0.4 jy .",
    "the orbiting ionized disk described in the preceding paragraph would have a 60@xmath0 optical depth @xmath10.2 @xcite and could account for this excess flux .",
    "thus , it is plausible that ionized gas , rather than dust , could generate the excess far - ir emission in some or even all algols .",
    "cool dust might also be present in some of these systems .",
    "the fact that algol itself and hip  73473 are both triple systems @xcite may supply a clue as to why cool dust is present at all .",
    "in addition to the characteristic mass transfer between primary and secondary , analysis indicates mass is also lost from algol systems @xcite",
    ". if a tertiary component is present , then the system could be analogous in essential respects to binary post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars , many of which are known to be orbited by a dusty circumbinary disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the central object ( a single star in the case of the post - agb stars and a binary in the case of algols ) , ejects mass , some of which is captured into a dusty surrounding disk by the gravity of an orbiting companion .    while such a model might apply to algol a and to hip  73473",
    ", it need not necessarily apply to other algols with far - ir excess emission . one obvious test would be a search for evidence of a third star in the hip  21604 and hip  76267 systems .",
    "the 1983 all - sky far - ir survey yielded a wealth of information about the properties of cool dust in orbit around main sequence stars .",
    "however , notwithstanding decades of ground- and space - based follow - up projects including , as of 2004 when we began the research reported here , in our opinion , a consistent , convincing evolutionary picture of these dusty stars had not been published . in particular , while various researchers had cross - correlated various stellar catalogs against the catalog , none had used the catalog .",
    "stellar distances and proper motions provided by the and tycho catalogs yield information useful for establishing ages of dusty stars ; reliable ages are essential if correct evolutionary sequences are to be deduced .",
    "also , as a consequence of the rather large beam - size and inadequate attention to elimination of background confusion , some previous stellar studies with have suffered from the inclusion of false positive far - ir - excess stars .    in the research",
    "reported here we have taken special effort to deduce stellar ages and to eliminate false positives . just as it is possible to deduce many properties of stellar clusters and associations even though some stars are mistakenly included as members , we trust that our table  2 sample is clean enough that our conclusions will stand the test of time . nonetheless , because ages of nearby field stars are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately and because of limitations with the database , we recognize that some entries in the tables and figures presented in this paper will be in error .    was most effective for the study of luminous b- and a - type main - sequence stars . in agreement with some earlier studies , we find that detected excess emission at 60@xmath0 from about 20% of nearby a - type stars . this percentage will certainly rise as the a stars are examined with far - ir photometers more sensitive than those aboard .",
    "in particular , we find that about 10% of stars of various spectral classes are revealed to display far - ir dust emission at brightness levels between and sensitivities .",
    "although this 10% subsumes stellar age , spectral types , and distance from earth and thus is potentially subject to selection effects , it is consistent with the well - defined tw hydra association sample of @xcite .",
    "using heterogeneous samples , @xcite and @xcite also reported about 10% of stars show dust excess in the mips 70@xmath0 band , but below sensitivity .    from their analysis of data sets , especially the volume - limited sample of @xcite",
    ", @xcite deduced that the percentage of stars with detectable 60@xmath0 emission diminishes with age .",
    "however , the small data set of habing et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and difficulties with estimating stellar age , precluded a meaningful quantitative result in our opinion . with our larger and more robust database",
    "we can derive that the probability of 60@xmath0 excess emission detectable with the sensitivity of is about 35 times larger for stars with ages in the range 10 - 50 myr compared to such stars with ages @xmath8 500 myr within the volume within 120 pc of earth .    while it is generally agreed that measurements at submillimeter wavelengths are best for the derivation of dust masses , by means of a simple model that relates submillimeter and far - ir fluxes , we are able to derive dust masses for numerous stars that lack submillimeter data .",
    "these masses lie in the range between 0.0005 and 0.5 _ _ m__@xmath70 . for stars with ages between 30 and 1000 myr ,",
    "these dust masses appear to depend little , if at all , on age . based on figure 5 , and as described in @xmath2  5.1",

    "can generally be derived based solely on data provided that excess flux is measured at two or more well - separated wavelengths with mips and/or the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "four algol binary stars appear to display excess emission at 60@xmath0 wavelength , although the existence of the excess is perhaps not compelling in all cases .",
    "we considered models in which the emission is generated by free - free and bound - free emission in orbiting ionized gas or by orbiting dust particles , dust perhaps associated with a tertiary ( third ) stellar component .",
    "future studies will be required to clarify the dominant physical mechanism(s ) involved .",
    "additional results of our study include : ( 1 ) peak @xmath3 ( @xmath71 ) does not vary much at all ages later than @xmath110myr ; this might be because occasional catastrophic dust - generating events can occur at any age .",
