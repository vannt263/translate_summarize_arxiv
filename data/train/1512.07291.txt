    "<S> considering the photoionization of ar@@xmath0 and kr@@xmath0 endofullerenes , the decay of @xmath0 innershell excitations through the outershell continuum of the confined atom _ via _ the inter - coulombic decay ( icd ) pathway is detailed . </S>",
    "<S> excitations to atom-@xmath0 hybrid states demonstrate coherence between icd and electron - transfer mediated decay ( etmd ) </S>",
    "<S> . this should be the dominant above - threshold decay process for a variety of confined systems , and the strength of these resonances is such that they should be amenable for study by photoelectron spectroscopy .    the resonant energy transfer from a donor to a near - neighbor acceptor molecule is a ubiquitous phenomenon in matter  @xcite . in complex materials , comprising a variety of light absorbing components called chromophores with clean absorption and fluorescence bands , </S>",
    "<S> the photoexcitation at the donor site is commonly followed by a migration of the energy to a closely separated acceptor chromophore which can subsequently relax to emit a fluorescent photon . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction between donor - acceptor active electrons is the conduit of such non - local energy transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this fluorescence resonant energy transfer ( fret ) spectroscopy has a vast range of applications in biological , nanoscale  @xcite , and nano - bio hybrid  @xcite systems . </S>",
    "<S> for relatively smaller aggregations of matter , such as clusters and dimers with limited electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom , the excited state of an inner electron at the donor site can often be embedded in the ionization continuum of the acceptor , resulting in a non - radiative release of an acceptor electron as the excitation energy relocates . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon , known as inter - coulombic decay ( icd ) , was predicted  @xcite and was first observed for ne clusters  @xcite some years ago . </S>",
    "<S> novel experiments on the icd process focusing on fundamental science are abundant  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , icd driven slow electrons may potentially find applications in controlled radiation damage in medical sciences  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the original excitation entails the transit of an electron from one center to the excited state of another center , then its decay with the creation of an outer shell vacancy on either center is called resonant electron - transfer mediated decay ( etmd )  @xcite .    from a fundamental spectroscopic viewpoint , probing resonant icd ( ricd ) processes  @xcite in relatively simpler gas - phase materials is of great interest  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one class of such systems undergoing significant current theoretical and experimental scrutiny is atomic endofullerene complexes , in which an atom is encapsulated in a fullerene molecule . </S>",
    "<S> these are unique heterogeneous and nested dimers of weak atom - fullerene bonding exhibiting very different electronic properties from the atom to the fullerene . from the experimental side , </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis techniques for these materials are fast - developing  @xcite with the huge advantage of their room - temperature stability . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these materials promise a plethora of applied contexts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the earliest prediction of the shortening of the decay time of a ne excited state through the icd pathway when ne is confined in @xmath0 was made in 2006  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , such broadening of atomic auger lines due to non - local coulomb - mediated decay in endofullerenes were also suggested by others  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first detailed calculations of ricd resonances corresponding to ar inner @xmath1 excitations in the photoionization of the levels of the encapsulating @xmath0 , the atom - to - fullerene _ forward _ ricd , was recently performed by us  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a dominant and novel effect was found in the coherence between the auger and icd transition amplitudes to produce resonance structures in the photoionization of atom - fullerene hybridized states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these resonant hybrid auger - icd ( rha - icd ) features , with their various shapes and widths , bear signatures of this coherence . </S>",
    "<S> however , to the best of our knowledge , no ricd of a @xmath0 inner vacancy producing a purely atomic outer vacancy in the encaged atom , the fullerene - to - atom _ backward _ ricd , has been predicted until now . </S>",
    "<S> only , as a reverse analogy , but for a non - resonant spectral effect from atom to fullerene , even when the participating charge densities are pure non - hybrid , was seen earlier  @xcite .    in this communication , </S>",
    "<S> considering the photoionization of the valence @xmath2 subshell of the atoms @xmath3 , ar and kr , in @xmath3@@xmath0 , we predict autoionizing resonances from the ricd of @xmath0 inner excitations . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the hybridization of some of the excited states of the compound , the ricd amplitude is also found to admix coherently with the etmd process . </S>",
    "<S> the results , along with our previous findings  @xcite , complete the full icd landscape in a photon - driven endofullene molecule , highlighting these materials , in gas or condensed phase , as possible candidates for experiments .    kohn - sham density functional theory is used to describe the ground state electronic structure of the compounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 molecule is modeled by smudging sixty c@xmath4 ions over a classical spherical jellium shell , fixed in space , with an experimentally known @xmath0 mean radius 3.5 and thickness @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus of the confined atom is placed at the center of the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the kohn - sham equations for the system of a total of @xmath6 electrons ( @xmath7 for ar , @xmath8 for kr and 240 delocalized electrons from @xmath0 ) are then solved to obtain the electronic ground state properties in the local density approximation ( lda ) . </S>",

    "<S> the time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda ) is employed to simulate the dynamical response of @xmath0 to incident photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole operator , @xmath11 , corresponding to light that is linearly polarized in @xmath11-direction , induces a frequency - dependent complex change in the electron density arising from dynamical electron correlations . </S>",

    "<S> obviously , @xmath15 includes the dynamical field produced by important electron correlations within the linear response regime . in this method , </S>",
    "<S> the photoionization cross section corresponding to a bound - to - continuum dipole transition @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where the tdlda matrix element @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the independent - particle lda matrix element .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that in @xmath3@@xmath0 the atomic valence @xmath20 electrons strongly hybridize with the energetically shallower @xmath21 electrons of the host @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subvalent @xmath2 levels of @xmath3 , however , maintain their purity , as seen in figure 1(a ) which shows predominantly atom - like ar @xmath1@ radial wavefunction from the ground lda spectrum of ar@@xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> ( although these levels are the quantum states of the whole compound , we use @xmath26@ and @@xmath26 respectively to ascertain their atom- or @xmath0-dominant character . ) using the well - known approach by fano  @xcite to describe the dynamical correlation through the interchannel coupling , the ricd amplitudes of these @xmath0 photo - vacancies _ via _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2@ ionization can be expressed by @xmath27 that denotes the coupling of @xmath0 discrete ( d ) excitation channels @xmath28 with the @xmath29 continuum ( c ) channel of @xmath3 . following  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 can be written as : @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , excitation energies and lda matrix elements of channels @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the photon energy corresponding to the @xmath29 transition . in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> obviously , the coulomb matrix element in the numerator of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dc - mat - element ] acts as the `` corridor '' for energy transfer from the @xmath0 de - excitation across to the atomic ionization process , producing icd resonances in the @@xmath2 cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    these @xmath0-to-@xmath3 icd resonances are displayed in figure 2 both for @xmath23 [ fig.2(a ) ] and @xmath1 [ fig.2(b ) ] photoionization of , respectively , confined kr and ar . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the spectra are rather dramatically structured . </S>",
    "<S> note that the corresponding results for free atoms are flat , since the current energy range does not include any regular autoionizing ( auger ) decay of atomic innershell vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the resonances in figs.2 are strong , of varied shapes , and should be easily accessible _ via _ photoelectron spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the narrow width of these resonances , which is very different than characteristic atomic auger resonances that are generally broad , is directly related to the @xmath0 excitations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , like generic cluster wavefunctions , @xmath0 wavefunctions are typically delocalized . spreading out over a large volume , in contrast to atomic localized electrons ( see , fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the autionization rate involves the matrix element of @xmath35 [ eq .  [ dc - mat - element ] ] , spread - out ( delocalized ) wavefunctions translate to a decrease in the value of the matrix element , as compared to atomic compact ( localized ) wavefunctions .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 exhibits three particularly notable features : ( i ) the above - threshold vacancy decay is completely dominated by icd . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) for both kr @xmath23@ and ar @xmath1@ , the characteristic cooper minima are moved lower in energy to 35 ev and 36 ev from their well known positions of 41 ev and 42 ev  @xcite , respectively , for free atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this shift is a consequence of the atom-@xmath0 dynamical coupling , particularly the coupling of @xmath3@xmath29 ionization with a host of @xmath0 continuum channels . </S>",
    "<S> note that this coupling was not included in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dc - mat - element ] , which only captures the resonances , but is certainly present in the full dipole matrix element @xmath36 ( see eq .  [ cross - pi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) a comparison with the empty @xmath0 cross section in fig.2(b ) reveals a few extra resonances in both the kr @xmath23@ and the ar @@xmath1 results . </S>",
    "<S> these are present owing to the additional excited states in the excited spectrum of the whole compound , since it now also includes the excited states of the caged atom . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , many of these excited states of the compound must be hybrids between the atomic and @xmath0 pure states  a fact addressed below suggests that some of these resonances are the result of the coherent mixing of icd and etmd amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> as an example , consider a hybridized dipole - allowed excited state @xmath37 from @xmath0 @@xmath24 [ fig.1(a ) ] in ar@@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial wavefunction of @xmath37 , shown in fig.1(b ) , results from a symmetric hybridization of free ar and empty @xmath0 @xmath38 excited states as @xmath39 , the hybridizations in @xmath34 and @xmath19 for this transition are then @xmath40 using eqs.[channel - hyb ] and [ me - hyb ] in eq .  [ dc - mat - element ] for the transition @xmath41 , and assuming that the overlap between ar @xmath38 and @xmath0 @xmath38 states is negligibly small , we can break up @xmath27 as @xmath42 embodies are schematically shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term denotes the release of energy from a _ transfer _ de - excitation ( blue arrow ) of the atomic part of the @xmath37 hybridized electron state , and the subsequent migration ( purple curved arrow ) of that energy to ar knocking out a @xmath1 electron ( red arrow ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process is essentially an etmd . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is the direct de - excitation ( black arrow ) of the @xmath0 part of @xmath37 followed by the regular icd . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , etmd and icd coherently mix to produce the ensuing resonance structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , some resonances in fig.2 occur from decay rates underpinning this coherence ; a detailed characterization of the structures based on fano - fitting is forthcoming .    to summarize , the first theoretical prediction for ricds of fullerene innershell photoexcitations producing outershell vacancies in the caged atom is described . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this generally appears to be the dominant , if not the only , single - excitation above - threshold decay mechanism through the atom s non - hybrid outer levels for any endofullerene molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the hybridized character of some of the excited states of the compound points to a coherence of icd with the etmd process . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting resonances are found aplenty and are quite amenable to being probed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> although the present calculation only includes _ participant _ ricds , where the precursor hole is filled by the excited electron itself , it is of great interest to access the influence of _ spectator _ processes ; these could significantly affect the situation and certainly need study . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with contemporary focus  @xcite on photoemission phase and time delay studies by interferometric metrology  @xcite , we hope that the current results will stimulate similar temporal spectroscopy with icd resonances .    finally , it is important to note that , based upon our explanation of the details of multicenter decay , this should be a strong process for any atom or molecule encaged in any fullerene , in any position , central or not . </S>",
    "<S> the icd - etmd coherence involves hybridization in the final continuum state which should be quite general  all it requires is that both the fullerene and the trapped atom or molecule have dipole - allowed final states , continuum and quasi - discrete , of the same symmetry . </S>",
