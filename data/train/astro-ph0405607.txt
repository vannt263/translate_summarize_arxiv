    "gravitational lensing has now become a popular tool to measure the mass distribution of structure in the universe on a range of scales .",
    "recently , there has been considerable progress in mapping the mass distribution on relatively large scales using cosmic shear @xcite , and on cluster scales combining strong and weak lensing features ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the scale of individual galaxies",
    "as well , there has been much work done on modeling and understanding multiple quasar systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in many cases it has become clear that it is almost never a unique lens that is responsible for the detected lensing and the presence of a nearby galaxy , group or cluster along the line of sight plays an important role in inducing the shear and amplification ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in other words , there are likely no clean lines of sight and comprehensive modeling is needed to map the lensing configuration accurately . therefore the mass mapping problem is best tackled using an `` inverse '' approach where the adopted method is to model the distribution of matter around many lines of sight , and optimise the mass distribution to match the observations as closely as possible .",
    "analysing galaxy - galaxy lensing using maximum - likelihood lensing techniques is an example of such a method .",
    "indeed , the goal of galaxy - galaxy lensing is to obtain constraints on the physical parameters that characterise the dark matter halos of galaxies .",
    "this is accomplished directly using lensing since the deformation in the shapes of background galaxies produced by the foreground lenses although weak is observationally detected statistically .",
    "the difficulty is that multiple deflections frequently occur along the line of sight , and therefore , nearby groups or clusters can have an important effect yet again on the resultant distorsions .",
    "this introduces a systematic bias in the mass obtained for the deflectors when using simple models .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing work began with the first detection of the signal from ground based data ( brainerd , blandford & smail 1996 , hereafter bbs ) and later with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) data @xcite .",
    "maximum - likelihood techniques have been developed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to obtain constraints on galaxy halo properties in clusters and in the field .",
    "the results of these analyses suggest that galaxy halos in clusters are significantly less massive but more compact compared to galaxy halos around field galaxies of equivalent luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite ) . besides , in the case of galaxy halos in the field no clear edge is detected to the mass distribution even on scales of the order of a few hundred kpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "only two published studies to date by hoekstra ( 2003 ) ; hoekstra , yee & gladders ( 2004 ) have been able to put an upper bound on the characteristic extension of a field halo at about @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 kpc , which are only marginally consistent with each other . besides these large values",
    "do not impose a stringent constraint for typical galaxy mass distributions since at these typical radii the galaxy density is only a few times above the mean density of the universe .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing studies provide information on average properties of the halo population , therefore the results depend on the specific parameterised model chosen to fit the observational data . from a purely observational point of view , the reliability of the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal depends on the number density of galaxies whose distorted shapes can be reliably measured , as well as any additional constraints that can be added to the analysis , for instance , redshifts of the lens galaxies , redshifts of the source galaxies , galaxy type , dynamical constraints , and the presence of larger scale structure like groups or clusters in the vicinity .",
    "other methods to determine the masses of galaxies are generally based on the dynamical properties of the luminous matter : measurement of the rotation curve or velocity dispersion , study of the velocity field of nearby objects like planetary nebulae , globular clusters , and satellite galaxies .",
    "these dynamical methods are complementary to lensing , but often probe much smaller scales .",
    "the study of the velocity field around galaxies for instance , is generally limited to local galaxies , however with the large spectroscopic surveys such as 2df and sdss , it is now possible to extend such analyses to larger scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . probing the dynamics of stars in galaxies is limited to the inner regions when studying high redshift galaxies .",
    "therefore , at the present time there is limited direct overlap between lensing and dynamical studies in terms of scales probed .",
    "although this situation is likely to change in the very near future when large spectroscopic surveys of distant galaxies such as the deep2 survey @xcite , the vvds survey @xcite or the z - cosmos survey ( http://webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/zcosmos ) are completed .",
    "the inner slopes of density profiles provide a strong test of structure formation in cold dark matter models and lensing provides an unbiased way to estimate the slopes . @xcite and @xcite have studied the slope of the mass distribution at small radii ( on scales ranging from a few to about 20 kpc ) by combining dynamical estimates and strong lensing constraints . they find that the mass distribution profile is flatter than the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) profile but steeper than the nfw profile . therefore , there is mounting evidence for the lack of cores ( a constant density region ) in galaxies as well as in clusters .    the galaxy - galaxy lensing results from the sloan digital sky survey have also provided ( @xcite ; @xcite ) interesting constraints on the distribution of light and dark matter in galaxies .",
    "mass and light trace seem to trace each other reasonably well .",
    "the power of galaxy - galaxy lensing is that it provides a probe of the gravitational potential of the halos of galaxies out to large radii , where no other methods are viable for inter - mediate as well as high redshift galaxies independent of the dynamical state of the system .",
    "a similar approach combining dynamical estimates of the central part of galaxies and galaxy - galaxy lensing is planned in the future as part of the gems and cosmos projects .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we describe the method adopted to model galaxy lenses , source galaxies , the simulations performed to recover the input parameters of the lenses and the calculation of the aperture mass . in section 3 , we present the results for three different classes of lens models considered in this work . in section 4 , we explore the results of re - parameterising the models .",
    "whenever necessary our results are scaled to the currently preferred flat , low matter density @xmath4cdm cosmology with @xmath5 and a hubble constant @xmath6 kms@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "in such a cosmology , at @xmath8 , @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath10 kpc .",
    "we briefly review the basic principles of gravitational lensing of distant galaxies before describing the mass distributions adopted to model them .",
    "this section concludes with the presentation of our method to recover the lensing galaxy parameters .",
    "the light rays emitted by a distant galaxy are distorted en - route to us by the presence of mass concentrations along the line of sight .",
    "the distorsion can produce strong effects like multiple images or arcs if there is close alignment between the distant source and a foreground source , but most of the time only a weak distorsion occurs in the galaxy shape .",
    "let us consider the multiple lensing equation @xcite . for two lenses a and b",
    ", the lens equation becomes : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the source position , @xmath13 is the deflection due to the lens a , @xmath14 is the deflection due to the lens b and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the angular diameter distances between source plane s and lens a , lens b and the observer respectively ( note that we must have @xmath18 ) .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath19 due to the lens @xmath20 is proportional to the angular distance @xmath21 between observer and lens @xmath20 and to the gradient of the projected gravitational potential @xmath22 generated by the lens @xmath20 .    for a given background galaxy ( i ) and its associated lens ( j )",
    ", we can construct the amplification matrix @xmath23 , which provides the mapping between the source plane and the image plane : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the convergence , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the two components of the shear . in the case of multiple deflections ( more than one lens contributing to the observed distortion )",
    ", we will assume that the total amplification matrix @xmath28 of the distant galaxy ( i ) is equal to the sum of the individual contributions @xmath23 from to each lens : @xmath29 this assumption relies on the fact that we are in the weak lensing regime and that the distance between the lenses is large compared to the einstein radius of each individual lens . for instance , in the simulations performed in this paper , the separation between two lenses is larger than 3 `` , when a typical value for the einstein radius is about 1 '' .",
    "lensing probes the two dimensional projected mass along the line of sight , therefore , we deal with the two dimensional potential , @xmath30 , resulting from the three dimensional density distribution @xmath31 projected onto the lens plane . the related projected surface mass density @xmath32 is then given by : @xmath33    moreover , we are interested in the two - dimensional projected mass inside radius @xmath34 ( the aperture radius @xmath35 ) defined as follows : @xmath36    in this paper , we study three different mass models ( i ) the two component pseudo - isothermal mass distribution ( _ piemd _ )",
    "@xcite , which is a more physically motivated mass profile than the isothermal sphere profile ( _ sis _ ) but sharing the same profile slope at intermediate radius ; ( ii ) the _ nfw _ @xcite profile and ( iii ) a power law profile with core radius ( _ pl _ ) .",
    "these enable us to explore a wide range of mass distributions and reveal the important parameters that lensing is sensitive to .",

    "in fact the nfw profile reproduces with good accuracy the radial distribution of structures in these simulations over 9 orders of magnitude in mass ( from the scale of globular clusters to that of massive galaxy clusters ) .",

    "then this catalogue is processed through a numerical code that retrieves the input parameters of the lenses using a maximum - likelihood method as proposed by @xcite and as implemented by natarajan & kneib ( 1997 ) . for each image ( @xmath129 ) , given a mass model for the foreground lensing galaxies , we can compute the amplification matrix @xmath28 as a sum of the contribution from all the foreground galaxies @xmath130 that lie within a circle of inner radius @xmath131 , and outer radius @xmath132 measured from the centre of the image ( @xmath129 ) : @xmath133 the total shear experienced by a background galaxy @xmath134 can be obtained by summing the contributions from all the foreground galaxies @xmath130 that lie within an annulus with inner and outer radii respectively at @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    given the observed ellipticity @xmath135 ( defined as @xmath136 ) and the associated amplification matrix @xmath28 , we are able to retrieve the intrinsic ellipticity @xmath137 of the source before lensing : @xmath138 in the weak lensing regime , this relation can be simplified as : @xmath139 in order to assign a likelihood to the parameters used to describe the lensing galaxies , we use @xmath140 , the ellipticity probability distribution in the absence of lensing . repeating this procedure for each image in the catalogue",

    "the likelihood function for the parametric mass model for the lenses does have interesting convergence properties .",
    "the likelihood surface is topologically complex since the degeneracies in the problem tend to produce several maxima .",
    "however , the convergence in both the cluster lens case and field lens case is driven essentially by the width of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the sources .",
    "the degeneracies in this scheme are the generic ones that plague all lensing analyses , the mass - sheet degeneracy ( essentially the addition of a constant sheet of mass to the lens plane does not produce any discernable effect on the lensing of the background sources ) , the shot noise due to the finite number of sampled background sources and the details of the truncation of the mass profile of the lenses .",
    "the mass sheet degeneracy can not be circumvented since we are necessarily measuring both the magnification @xmath25 and the shear @xmath142 from the same data points .",
    "note that these are implicitly needed in computing the amplification matrix .",
    "shot noise is more of a limitation in ground - based surveys when the number count of background galaxies is sparser compared to the space based data despite the fact that lensing helps by magnifying fainter sources that normally would not make it into a magnitude limited survey .",
    "the details of the mass profile , and in fact , the prescription used to truncate the mass at large radii influences the likelihood results . since in galaxy - galaxy lensing ( both in the field and interior to a cluster ) we are most sensitive to the mass enclosed within an aperture and are less sensitive to the density profile in the inner regions the truncation of the mass distribution at large radii drives the convergence of the likelihood function .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the plots where the influence of @xmath1 shows up directly in the likelihood contours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "note that the parameters chosen to characterise the mass model : the central velocity dispersion and the truncation radius also contribute to the noise in the likelihood , thereby pointing to more efficient re - parameterisations that we also explore in the final section of this paper .",
    "we construct a composite mass model for the cluster by superposing a large - scale smooth mass component and individual galaxies . as a first guess for the smooth mass model we use the averaged shear field obtained by simply binning up the shear in radial bins from the centre outward .",
    "this is a prior in the analysis that gets modified with every iteration once the clumps are added to the model .",
    "we simulate the deformations induced by a clump with known parameters ( which can be easily derived from a weak lensing analysis for example ) .",
    "then we add in the individual cluster galaxies and derive the shear of this composite system , which turns out to be larger than the shear for the clump alone as expected : this implies that we need to simultaneously modify the smooth component and the clumps during the optimisation process . in massive lensing clusters , about 10% of the total mass is associated with the individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "this large scale clump is described by a piemd profile with the following parameters : @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "this gives a total integrated mass of 7.3 10@xmath146m@xmath147 .",
    "the mass we partition to galaxies is of the order of 7.3 10@xmath148m@xmath147 .",
    "how do we modify the large - scale clump s parameters in order to match the shear field ?",
    "we find that the velocity dispersion of the large - scale clump needs to reduced by about 5% , keeping the others parameters fixed to accomodate the clumpiness .",
    "we present the results obtained for the simulated data set , for the piemd , nfw and truncated power law ( pl ) models for two different configurations ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] at the end of the paper ) .",
    "the points mark the value of the input parameters used in order to generate the simulated catalogue , and the cross stands for the value of the output parameters as estimated from the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "we will refer to the different plots by assigning them a number , the first one is the upper left plot , and the last one ( plot number 9 ) is the lower right plot .",
    "the first plot shows the reference field situation : 25000 elliptical sources in a field of 26@xmath14926 arcmin@xmath150 , which translates into a number density of about 35 galaxies per arcmin@xmath150 .",
    "then the following plots ( 2 , 3 , 4 ) show the results obtained with 25000 circular sources , then with 40000 elliptical sources mimicking typical space observations with a density of 60 galaxies per arcmin@xmath150 , then with 12500 elliptical sources , corresponding to the ground based configuration with a galaxy density of 17 per arcmin@xmath150 , in a field configuration .",
    "note that in the case of circular sources , we do not have to deal with the intrinsic ellipticity noise : the detection is therefore improved and the contours are tighter .",

    "the standard configuration has 25000 background sources ( a density of 35 galaxies per arcmin@xmath150 ) , we explore what happens when we increase this number to 40000 ( 60 per arcmin@xmath150 ) , or reduce it to 12500 ( 17 per arcmin@xmath150 ) .",
    "17 galaxies per square arcminute corresponds to simulating ground based survey data , whereas 60 galaxies per square arcminute corresponds to the space based survey data .",
    "the main difference between the ground and space configurations is that from space , the statistics are significantly improved , and so the detection contours are significantly narrower .      to quantify the uncertainty arising from not knowing the redshifts for background sources",
    ", we performed the analysis after assigning redshifts drawn from a distribution .",
    "the 25000 sources are put at a mean redshift @xmath153 and images are simulated .",
    "when constructing the simulated catalogue , the background objects are assigned a mean redshift of @xmath154 .",
    "this catalogue is then input into the maximum likelihood code . since the strength of the shear is proportional to the distance between the sources and the lenses , under estimating the source redshifts leads to an overestimate of the lens masses and tends to shift the confidence contours toward higher values for the velocity dispersion .",
    "for the same reason , systematically overestimating the source redshifts leads to an underestimate of the galaxy masses . in any case",
    ", we find that a redshift uncertainty of @xmath155 does not dramatically modify the conclusions .",
    "this is the typically the precision we can get with photometric redshift estimation which is encouraging for future surveys .",
    "this results is coherent with a recent study by kleinheinrich et al . , 2004 based on the galaxy - galaxy lensing results from the combo-17 survey . they found that it is of great importance to know the redshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties of their dark matter halos , but that the knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurements only very little over use of statistical source redshift distribution .    to be more quantitative , let us consider the lensing equation and express it for a constant deflection angle .",
    "for a piemd profile with a given @xmath81 , we have : @xmath156 as introduced in @xcite .",
    "therefore the equation can be rewritten as : @xmath157 the lenses are kept at a redshift of 0.2 , and the mean redshift of the sources is changed by @xmath158 20 % .",
    "we then evaluate the corresponding @xmath159 error introduced in the retrieval of the central velocity dispersion in the likelihood analysis .",
    "table [ deltaz ] gives the results : when we put an error of @xmath160 ( % ) , this give a variation of @xmath161 equal to @xmath162 , and the corresponding variation on @xmath81 is of order @xmath159 .",
    "this range of values is given by the projection of the 3@xmath151 contours along the @xmath81 axis .",
    "we can see that the variation in the detection range is in agreement with the calculations made .",
    ".influence of an uncertainty in the mean redshift of the sources : an error of @xmath160 correspond to a variation of @xmath161 equal to @xmath162 , which correspond to a variation on @xmath81 of order @xmath159 .",
    "we see from this table that this estimated variation on @xmath81 is coherent with the variation in the detection range as derived from the maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      when working with the real data , we will have to put in by hand the description of the cluster .",
    "the reliability of the results will depend on the accuracy with which we describe cluster . in order to study the influence of the uncertainty of the cluster profile ,",
    "the cluster component is described by a piemd profile with a velocity dispersion of @xmath163 .",
    "when constructing the simulated catalogue , the cluster component is assigned a velocity dispersion of @xmath164 .",
    "the likelihood is then computed for this case .",
    "for the piemd and nfw profiles , we found that we are able to retrieve the characteristic halo parameters with extremely good accuracy , for every configuration .",
    "in fact , interestingly enough , the dotted lines in figs . 9 , 10 , and 11 show us that the aperture mass is retrieved very accurately .",
    "this immediately suggests the re - parameterisation of models considered here : rather than fitting in the ( @xmath165 ) plane , we can fit the deformations directly in the ( @xmath166 ) plane .",
    "this formulation is explored in the next section .    for the pl profile",
    ", we find that we can put some constraints on @xmath83 , the slope of the density profile , but not on the velocity dispersion , since the likelihood function does not always converge along that direction .",
    "so we can use this profile to estimate the slope of dark matter halos , without trusting the constraints we get on the velocity dispersion for the profile .",
    "when working with real data , the results we get depend on the value chosen for @xmath132 .",
    "when we take a low value for @xmath132 , the shear for the image ( i ) is calculated with fewer lenses , and we find that the contours do not close in @xmath39 .",
    "when the value of this parameter is increased , the contours converge and close . on the other hand ,",
    "picking a high value for @xmath132 introduces some noise in calculating the shear , and can dilute the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal significantly : lenses that do not _ effectively _ participate in the lensing of an image if utilised in the calculation become a source of noise . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] illustrates precisely this situation : for a given value of @xmath132 , we obtain a good estimate of @xmath81 , but the robustness of the constraint on @xmath39 is directly related to the value of @xmath132 .",
