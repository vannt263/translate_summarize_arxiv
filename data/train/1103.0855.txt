    "in addition , constraints might be present on the driving fields , e.g. to match experimental conditions : they can be expressed usually as a function of the driving fields @xmath7 .",
    "typical scenarios and corresponding cost functions and constraints are :    1 .",
    "the goal is the preparation of a well - defined quantum state @xmath8 with high accuracy for which a convenient cost function is the infidelity , @xmath9 2 .",
    "the target state is the unknown ground state of a hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "the cost function is then given by the final system energy , @xmath11 3 .",
    "the target is some property or condition that many states can satisfy , like for example , in the production of highly entangled states . in this case",
    "the cost function is simply defined as@xmath12 where @xmath13 is a convenient measure of the entanglement of the state @xmath14 .",
    "a constraint is present on the power of the driving fields , that is , the solution should minimize also the fluences @xmath15 5 .",
    "a limited bandwidth is allowed for the driving fields : below we show how this is already embedded in the algorithm and is not necessary to consider it as an additional explicit constraint . 6 .",
    "the initial state or the driving fields are known within a given uncertainty @xmath16 . in this case",
    ", the cost function can be defined as an average other all possible outcomes compatible with that uncertainty , as for example : @xmath17    all of the aforementioned optimization problems are then recast in the problem of solving the schdinger equation ( from now on we assume @xmath18 ) @xmath19|\\psi ( t)\\rangle , \\label{schr_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with boundary condition @xmath20 , while minimizing the cost function @xmath21 where the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 allow for a proper weighting of the different contributions ( the @xmath24s play the role of lagrange multipliers ) and @xmath25 is the chosen cost function .    to perform such an optimization ,",
    "the crab algorithm starts from an initial pulse guess @xmath26 and then looks for the best correction of the form @xmath27 the functions @xmath28 are expanded in a simple form in some function basis characterized by some parameters @xmath29 ( fourier space , lagrange polynomials , etc . ) : @xmath30 .",
    "the two key ingredients of the crab optimization are that the function space is truncated to some finite number of components @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and that the corresponding basis functions are `` randomized '' to enhance the algorithm convergence , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a random number .",
    "indeed , this last choice breaks the orthonormalization of the functions @xmath35 , however as we show in the following , it allows for an improved convergence of the algorithm as it enlarge the subspace of functions explored by the algorithm while keeping constant the number of optimization parameters .",
    "the optimization problem is then reformulated as the extremization of the multivariable cost function @xmath36 , which can be numerically approached with a suitable method , e.g. , steepest descent , conjugate gradient or direct search methods  @xcite .",
    "hereafter we use the last option , which is the simplest one and easily compatible with any technique employed to solve the dynamics induced by @xmath37 $ ] ( either exact solution of the eq .",
    "( [ schr_eq ] ) or approximate solution with time dependent dmrg  @xcite ) .",
    "this choice also gives another advantage with respect to other oc methods where gradients and functional derivatives have to be computed , increasing the complexity of the optimization procedure .",
    "as an example , in the following problems , we focus on the case of a single control parameter @xmath38 and we choose to work in the fourier basis .",
    "the optimal pulse can then be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a time dependent function enforcing the boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath41 for @xmath42 and for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the function @xmath44 is fixed by selecting the optimization parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with @xmath31 the dimension of each vector . in conclusion ,",
    "given a fixed total evolution time @xmath3 , the cost function is clearly just a function of the control parameters , @xmath47 the optimization problem is reduced to the minimization of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 variables . as mentioned before , however , the space of the variables can be reduced even more : although in principle the frequencies @xmath46 can be considered free variables it is often convenient to keep them fixed and to perform the minimization just with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "indeed as shown in our analysis this is sufficient to obtain good results . in this approach",
    "we need then a criterion to select the @xmath46 s .",
    "when we have no available information about the typical energy scales of the system under consideration , the frequencies are picked _ randomly _ around principal harmonics :",
    "@xmath52 , with @xmath53 random numbers with flat distribution in the interval @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 .",
    "viceversa when the physical details of the model are known , clearly one can exploit this information to select the relevant frequencies , as shown in the following sections .",
    "in this section we apply the crab optimization to a paradigmatic problem in quantum information theory and control : we search for the optimal way to perform a state transformation of a two - qubit system , in particular we consider two capacitively coupled josephson charge qubits , even though the following analysis can be easily adapted to different qubit implementations .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath56-th qubit is defined as  @xcite @xmath57 where the @xmath58s are pauli matrices , @xmath59 is the charging energy and @xmath60 is the josephson energy and @xmath61 . for capacitive coupled qubits , the interaction hamiltonian reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the charging energy associated to the coulomb interaction between the qubits .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath64 , while the coupling will be the driving field @xmath65 we use to optimize the transformation .",
    "we will consider as initial state the state with no excess cooper pairs @xmath66 , and our goal states will be three different state with different properties : the reversed separable state @xmath67 , the homogeneous superposition state @xmath68 , and the maximally entangled bell state @xmath69 .",
    "note that due to the fact that only the coupling is controlled , all three states are not trivial to achieve .",
    "we set the total time of the transformation to the somehow arbitrary time scale @xmath70 and we perform a crab optimization using the truncated expansion of the function @xmath71 given in eq .",
    "( [ field_crab : eq ] ) , with a constant initial guess for the driving field @xmath72 .",
    "we considered an additional constraint on the fluence of the control field , thus the resulting cost function is defined as    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by equations  ( [ effe ] ) and  ( [ fluence ] ) respectively .",
    "here we are interested in studying the effect of the randomness introduced in the frequencies of the expansion  ( [ field_crab : eq ] ) , thus we optimize both in the case of random @xmath53 and with @xmath76 . to perform a fair comparison , we ran the optimization in both cases with the same maximum number of calls @xmath77 to the function @xmath78 , which fixes the simulation complexity . indeed , in the first case we repeated the optimization for thirty different @xmath53 random configurations ( with a single @xmath79 random starting point ) , while in the second case the optimization was repeated over thirty initial random @xmath79 configurations .",

    "in this section we analyze in more detail the features characterizing the optimal dynamics induced by crab . in order to better understand the matter",
    ", we draw a comparison with a simpler non - optimized dynamics , in which the driving field is linearly dependent on time ; in particular we focus the attention on the lmg model .",
    "an important point in the study of the dynamics of a quantum system is usually represented by the _ adiabatic theorem _  @xcite .",
    "the latter establishes that a system initially prepared in its ground state can be driven by a time dependent hamiltonian adiabatically ( i.e. without introducing excitations ) , if the time scale of the evolution is much larger than the minimum spectral gap , i.e. @xmath169 .",
    "in critical systems the spectral gap closes at the phase transition , so that the system gets excited from the instantaneous gs while crossing the critical point for any finite - time evolution  @xcite . for finite - size systems , the critical gap is not completely closed , but it presents a pronounced minimum where the excitation appears , as shown in fig  [ lmg_lin_inst_prob_fig ] : an estimate of the excitations induced by a linear driving can be obtained by kibble - zurek theory  @xcite . in the picture we monitored the instantaneous total excitation probability @xmath170 ( dashed line ) , and the populations of lowest levels ( different style [ color ] lines ) during the dynamics .",
    "the evolution starts at large negative times ( left ) and ends at the time @xmath171 ( right ) ; the critical point is crossed around the time @xmath172 when @xmath173 , see section  [ lmg_crab : sec ] .",
    "far from the critical point the system evolves adiabatically as demonstrated by the low total instantaneous excitation probability ; notice that before reaching the critical point the total excitation probability coincides with the small excitation of only the first level ( red continuous line ) . in a restricted region around the critical point ( @xmath174 )",
    "the total excitation probability jumps to values of order @xmath141 and does not change significantly any more .",
    "notice that in the final part of the evolution more levels get populated , as shown by the difference between the instantaneous infidelity and the excitation probability of the first level .",
    "at the final time @xmath175 the excitation probability is equal to the infidelity of the process , i.e. @xmath176 .",
    "we then optimize the final infidelity , and the correspondent plot for the optimal evolution is reported in fig  [ lmg_crab_inst_prob_fig ] .",
    "the scenario in this case is completely different : the system is excited at the very beginning of the dynamics and remains excited for the most part of the evolution until close to the end , when the infidelity drops abruptly to zero .",
    "it is interesting to notice that just a few levels are excited , as demonstrated by the small difference between the total excitation probability ( dashed line ) and the excitation probability of the first level ( red continuous line ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous findings where the authors showed that this kind of dynamics can be approximated by a two - level system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the abrupt jump in the probabilities around the time @xmath177 is due to an abrupt ( double ) change of sign in @xmath178 , reversing suddenly the order of the levels and transforming the gs in the most excited state ( dash - dash - dotted [ cyan ] line ) , thus this signature is not due to a collective involvement of all the levels but simply to a reshuffling of their order . indeed as shown in the picture for @xmath179 , with the subsequent change of sign the previous order is reestablished .",
    "we can then summarize the main features of the optimal evolution induced by crab in three points : it is strongly non adiabatic ; it involves just a restricted number of levels although not necessarily close to the nominal instantaneous ground state and it is such that at the very end all populations constructively interfere to obtain the desired goal state .",
    "in this paper we studied in detail the performance of quantum optimal control through the crab optimization  @xcite .",
    "in particular we focused the attention on three different systems and different figures of merit , in order to outline the versatility of the method .",
    "we first studied the optimization of state transformations of two qubits via a controlled coupling .",
    "we have shown that the crab optimization is very effective already using only a few optimization parameters and the fundamental role that the randomization of the function basis plays in increasing the process convergence .",
    "we then analyzed two many - body quantum systems : the first one , the lmg model , is the prototype of many - body system with long range interaction undergoing a quantum phase transition .",
    "the success of crab in this context confirms the possibility of controlling complex systems typically studied in condensed matter , with relatively small resources : due to crab unique features , only few parameters ( @xmath180 frequencies ) are indeed sufficient to obtain excellent results .",
    "the second many - body quantum system studied , the transfer of information along a spin chain , is a typical problem studied in quantum information theory : the high accuracy achievable through crab optimization makes it a valuable tool for this kind of applications .",
    "moreover , due to the simple structure of the optimal pulses , they may be used to extract information on the typical timescales involved on the system dynamics , as we did for the information transfer in spin chains .",
    "we stress also that the exponential dependence of the figures of merit as a function of the number of parameters found in all cases ( see figs .  [ minerr ] ,  [ crab_lmg_inf_vs_npar_fig ] ,  [ crab_chain_inf_vs_npar_fig ] ) suggests that in general already a moderate number of optimization parameters will be sufficient to get huge improvements in the desired processes .",
    "finally , we have shown that with a simple change of the cost function , the crab optimization can be used to optimize the search of the unknown ground state of a hamiltonian or to generate quantum states satisfying desired properties , i.e. high entangled states . monitoring the instantaneous excitation probabilities generated by the optimized process",
    ", we have demonstrated the highly non adiabatic character of the dynamics and the fact that , despite the complexity of the system under study , just a restricted number of excited levels are really populated during the evolution . the latter fact justifies the compatibility of crab with dmrg - like techniques .",
    "we mention that the crab optimization has been applied also to open quantum systems obtaining interesting results and thus increasing its possible applications  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the main features of the crab optimization versatility ( different constraints , compatibility with approximate simulation methods and experiments ) , fast convergence ( the final error scales exponentially with the number of optimization parameters while the number of algorithm iterations linearly ) and simplicity ( small modification to existing numerical codes for quantum system simulations) demonstrate that the crab optimization is not only an unique solution for many body quantum systems optimal control but it is a valid alternative also in many different settings where other optimal control tools exist  @xcite ."

    "<S> the field of application of these methods is severely limited also by the need to have access to huge amount of information about the system , e.g. computing gradients of the control fields , expectation values of observables as a function of time . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> standard oc algorithms define a set of euler - lagrange equations that have to be solved to find the optimal control pulse  @xcite , where the equation for the correction to the driving field is highly dependent on the constraints imposed on the system and on the figures of merit considered . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that considering different figures of merit and/or constraints on the system needs a redefinition of the corresponding euler - lagrange equations , hindering a straightforward adaptation of the optimization procedure to different situations .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the _ chopped random basis _ ( crab ) technique , an optimization method directed to overcome these difficulties and already introduced in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the crab optimization is based on the definition of a truncated randomized basis of functions for the control fields that recast the problem from a functional minimization to a multi - variable function minimization that can be performed , for example , via a direct - search method . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the following , the crab optimization flexibility allows to construct oc pulses just exploiting the available resources . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , different figures of merit and constraints can be easily considered without any complications . </S>",
    "<S> another appealing characteristic of crab is its compatibility with t - dmrg techniques : this feature indeed significantly enlarges the class of controllable systems  @xcite , from few - body or exactly solvable to general many - body quantum systems with `` moderate '' degree of entanglement generated during the dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is , to the best of our knowledge , the unique oc algorithm that can be applied in such vast setting . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it can be straightforward applied also in a closed - loop optimization experiment , where the simulation of the system under study is replaced with the experiments itself .    here </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the crab optimization as a possible general oc algorithm to be used also in a standard context ( solvable and/or few body systems ) as a valid alternative tool with respect to standard oc methods to find optimal control fields . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recently optimization methods based on the expansion over a particular function basis have shown to be effective  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a similar approach has been proved to be mathematically convergent and consistent  @xcite . on top of that </S>",
    "<S> , some theoretical analysis over control landscapes suggests that , at least in the absence of constraints , the figure of merit landscape might be smooth enough to allow for simple optimization procedures to work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we show that indeed a convenient choice of the function basis driven by physical or geometrical arguments is enough to obtain optimal driving fields . however , in the cases where no physical intuition drives the choice of the function basis , the crab algorithm allows to find the optimal driving fields where a simple ansatz would fail . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a comparison between the results of crab with and without a physically driven choice of the basis , as well as previous results obtained using different optimal control algorithms ( krotov s algorithm ) , show comparable performances  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the paper is the following : in sec .  </S>",

    "<S> [ joseph_crab : sec ] it is applied to a paradigmatic quantum control problem , the state transformation of two coupled qubits , to show its potential . then we compare the results obtained via crab optimization in more complex cases already present in literature  @xcite : in sec .  </S>",
