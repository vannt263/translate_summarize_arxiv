    "the rotational motion in deformed nucleus is a typical symmetry - restoring collective motion and it appears as the rotational band , i.e. , a group of eigenstates generated from one deformed intrinsic state  @xcite .",
    "in fact a nice rotational spectrum with @xmath0 , can be obtained for the ground state band of even - even nuclei by the method of angular momentum projection from an axially - symmetric deformed state .",
    "the angular momentum projection is a standard quantum mechanical technique to restore the rotational invariance broken in the mean - field approximation , and is suitable to microscopically describe the nuclear collective rotation  @xcite .",
    "however , this technique has not been very commonly utilized especially for the description of the high - spin states except for the works by the projected shell model approach , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we propose a method to reliably calculate the high - spin rotational band based on the angular momentum projection method .",
    "a standard method to describe the high - spin states is the mean - field approximation combined with the cranking model  @xcite ; namely the hamiltonian transformed into the uniformly rotating frame ( the so - called routhian ) , @xmath1 is considered instead of the original hamiltonian @xmath2 . here the quantity @xmath3 is the rotational ( or cranking ) frequency and @xmath4 is the angular momentum operator around the rotation - axis ( here chosen to be the @xmath5-axis ) .",
    "it was first introduced by inglis to calculate the moment of inertia of the ground state rotational band  @xcite treating the cranking term @xmath6 as a lowest order perturbation , i.e. , at the @xmath7 limit .",
    "it was extended to the finite frequency to understand various phenomena at high - spin states as the selfconsistent cranking model  @xcite or the cranked shell model  @xcite , see e.g. refs .",
    "recently its three - dimensional version , i.e. , the so - called tilted - axis - cranking  @xcite , was also successfully applied , see e.g. ref .",
    "the basic idea is that the selfconsistent mean - field state obtained by minimizing the routhian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : routh ] ) depends on the rotational frequency , @xmath8 , and is interpreted as an intrinsic state suitably describing the high - spin state at the spin value @xmath9 . in this way the effects of the collective rotation on the mean - field parameters like the deformations and the pairing gaps can be well taken into account .    the angular momentum projection is a fully microscopic method to calculate a sequence of quantum states belonging to one rotational band .",
    "although we can obtain a whole sequence of the band by the projection from one intrinsic state , the resultant spectrum is not always very accurate especially for the high - spin part ; for example , the calculated moment of inertia is almost constant or even decreases as a function of spin , while the observed inertia markedly increases at high - spin states in most of the realistic cases .",
    "this is due to the fact that the rotational effect , e.g. , the coriolis anti - pairing effect , is not taken into account when only one intrinsic state is employed in the projection",
    ". however , if we intend to combine the cranking model and the angular momentum projection method , we encounter a puzzling situation ; namely , we have many spectra depending on the cranking frequencies , each of which is obtained as a result of angular momentum projection from one mean - field state associated with each different frequency .",
    "it may be considered that the best way is to choose the lowest energy state for each spin value ; i.e. , the idea of the variation after projection regarding the cranking frequency as a variational parameter .",
    "it has been shown , however , that this does not necessarily work in practice  @xcite ; if the rotational frequency is treated as a variational parameter at each spin value , it happens that the resultant spectrum does not compose a regular rotational pattern . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is recommended to calculate the spin @xmath10 state by the projection from the cranked state with the frequency @xmath3 that gives @xmath11 .",
    "however , this procedure is not efficient because the angular momentum projection should be performed for each spin state from the intrinsic state with each different cranking frequency , and there is still no guarantee that a regular rotational sequence is obtained .",
    "thus , how to compromise the cranking model and the angular momentum projection method is a non - trivial problem . in the present work ,",
    "we attack the problem by a different approach : the resultant state for each spin value is calculated by superposing the multiple states obtained by projection from the cranked mean - field states with various rotational frequencies , i.e. , in the sense of the configuration mixing or the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "the original idea goes back to the work by peierls - thouless  @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the resultant spectrum does not essentially depend on the chosen set of rotational frequencies as long as the number of them is sufficient ; the necessary number is in fact rather small , something like four to five .",
    "thus the accurate rotational band can be efficiently calculated by the configuration mixing , or the gcm , of a rather small number of angular momentum projected states ; we call this procedure as `` angular momentum projected multi - cranked configuration mixing '' . after a brief explanation of the formulation of the actual procedure in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] , we will show three examples of calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the method of calculation we adopt is a version of the angular momentum projected configuration mixing , or the projected gcm , where the cranking frequency @xmath3 is considered as a generator coordinate .",
    "thus the resultant state with spin @xmath10 is obtained in the form @xmath12 where the operator @xmath13 is the angular momentum projector and the amplitude @xmath14 is determined by the so - called hill - wheeler equation , @xmath15 with definitions of the hamiltonian and norm kernels , @xmath16 see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "a set of the intrinsic states , @xmath17 , from which the projection is performed , is chosen to be composed of mean - field states , i.e. , hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) states , which are obtained by the selfconsistent cranking model based on the routhian @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : routh ] ) with a suitably chosen set of rotational frequencies , ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) , i.e. @xmath21 . then the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) is nothing else but the discrete version of @xmath22 which was originally considered by peierls - thouless  @xcite .    instead of the amplitude @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) , the properly normalized amplitude  @xcite , @xmath23 should be considered in order to study the configuration mixing .",
    "for example , the probability of the @xmath24-th hfb state in the eigenstate @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 or for eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptanz ] ) , @xmath27    in the present work we only consider the angular momentum projection for simplicity , but the number and parity projections should be incorporated if necessary .",
    "however , the conservation of neutron and/or proton number is important for the configuration mixing calculation , and we use the approximate way to take it into account  @xcite when the system is in the superfluid phase ; i.e. , the hamiltonian kernel in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hw ] ) is replaced by @xmath28 with @xmath29 where the operator @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the neutron ( proton ) number operator and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the number to be fixed . the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eq .  ( [ eq : chkernel ] ) are taken to be the calculated neutron and proton chemical potentials of the first hfb state @xmath36 ; this choice is enough for the present purpose .    in the following section",
    "we will show examples of calculation performed by the procedure of the angular momentum projected multi - cranked configuration mixing described above .",
    "we have recently developed an efficient method for the general quantum - number projection and gcm  @xcite , and it has been applied to the study of the nuclear tetrahedral deformation  @xcite .",
    "the method is fully utilized also in the present work .",
    "as for the effective interaction we employ the finite range gogny interaction  @xcite with the d1s parameter set  @xcite .",
    "the standard method of the harmonic - oscillator basis expansion is used for the hfb as well as the projection calculations .",
    "the calculational details related to the gogny interaction are the same as those explained in ref .",
    "@xcite except for one point : the coulomb exchange contribution is treated in the slater approximation although we are able to perform the exact calculation .",
    "this is because the selfconsistently calculated pairing correlation for protons quite often vanishes ( or becomes very small ) in the normal deformed nuclei in the rare earth region due to the fact that the coulomb antipairing effect is too strong in the exact treatment  @xcite .",
    "this deficiency would be avoided if the variation after the number projection is performed  @xcite .",
    "the proton pairing correlation is important to describe the collective rotation and we use the hfb calculation in the present work .",
    "therefore the slater approximation is the simplest way to avoid the deficiency .",
    "in the present work we consider three examples of application ; the ground state band of a typical rare - earth nucleus @xmath37er , the ground state band of a very neutron - rich nucleus @xmath38 mg , and the superdeformed band of a representative nucleus @xmath39dy . it has been found that the non - cranked hfb calculation gives axially symmetric deformation in these three examples .",
    "we will discuss the @xmath40-pole deformation parameter of the calculated mean - field defined by @xmath41 and the average pairing gap by  @xcite @xmath42 where the quantity @xmath43 is the abnormal density matrix ( the pairing tensor ) and @xmath44 is the matrix element of the pairing potential with the anti - symmetrized matrix element @xmath45 of the two - body interaction  @xcite .",
    "as for the oscillator basis expansion the frequency @xmath46  mev is employed and all the basis states with the oscillator quantum numbers @xmath47 satisfying @xmath48 are retained .",
    "we mainly use @xmath49 ; however , smaller values are also adopted for some calculations which require heavy numerical effort . for the calculation of the angular momentum projector in eq .",
    "( [ eq : proj ] ) , the gaussian quadrature over the three euler angles @xmath50 is necessary : even if the non - cranked hfb calculation gives the axially symmetric solution , the cranking term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : routh ] ) breaks the axial symmetry of the system .",
    "the number of integration mesh points for the angle @xmath51 , which is the same for the angle @xmath52 , is taken to be @xmath53 , and that for the angle @xmath54 to be @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the maximum values of the @xmath10 and @xmath58 quantum numbers suitably chosen for each case .",
    "it has been known that the density - dependent term in the skyrme interaction causes various numerical problems , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the gogny interaction has the same density - dependent term and we encounter the situations that unphysical spectra are obtained due to the density - dependent term ; for example , the spectra in the well - deformed odd mass nuclei sometimes do not look like rotational .",
    "the reason why we judge that it is due to the density - dependent term is that quite nice rotational spectra are recovered if we exclude it , although then the absolute energy and the moment of inertia are different from what they should be .",
    "it seems to us that the time - odd components of the wave function induced by the cranking term tend to increase the rate of occurrence of this problem particularly for odd and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "however , we only consider even - even nuclei in the present work and the considered cranking frequency is not very high .",
    "any problems related to the density - dependent term did not seem to occur in the following examples .",
    "another remark is related to the so - called norm cut - off ; the states whose norm eigenvalues are smaller than a certain value are excluded when solving the hill - wheeler equation  ( [ eq : hw ] ) .",
    "the value for cut - off should be small enough not to miss important contributions , while it should not be too small in order to avoid the numerical difficulty in the gcm related to the vanishing norm states  @xcite .",
    "we generally try to find a proper value as small as possible .",
    "it is , however , necessary to choose a suitable value for each calculation depending on the situation .",
    "this is because we use the same norm cut - off for all spin members under consideration in the calculation of a whole rotational band .",
    "it could happen that some small norm states included at some spins , which is controlled by the value of the norm cut - off , get excluded at different spins when solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : hw ] ) . such a change of included states at different spins may cause discontinuities of the rotational spectrum . therefore we should adjust value of the norm cut - off so that any discontinuities would not happen ; we are able to find such a proper value for the norm cut - off .      the first example is the ground state rotational band of a nucleus @xmath37er , where the high - spin states up to @xmath60 are measured  @xcite .",
    "we use the oscillator basis with @xmath49 .",
    "the selfconsistently calculated values of the mean - field parameters of the ground state in this nucleus are @xmath61 for the quadrupole deformation , which roughly corresponds to the experimentally deduced value  @xcite , and @xmath62  mev for the neutron and proton average pairing gaps , respectively , which are about 10%13% smaller than the even - odd mass differences . in this case",
    "the system is in the superfluid phase , and we apply the quasiparticle basis cut - off at the level of @xmath63 , i.e. , only the canonical basis states whose occupation probabilities are larger than @xmath63 are considered , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . as for the projection calculation",

    "this result clearly shows the importance of the cranking procedure for the angular momentum projection calculation , which was emphasized in refs .",

    "in the present work we propose a method to reliably calculate the rotational band by employing the fully microscopic angular momentum projection technique combined with the cranking model .",
    "the method is based on the configuration mixing after the projection , in the sense of the gcm , employing several cranked hfb states with different rotational frequencies ; the original idea was suggested by peierls - thouless  @xcite . by applying the method to a few realistic examples , it has been found that the necessary number of cranked hfb states employed in the configuration mixing is rather small , something like four to five in the examples studied .",
    "the result is essentially independent of the chosen set of cranking frequencies and the set of equidistant frequencies in a suitably chosen range has been mainly utilized .",

    "another example is the superdeformed rotational band in @xmath39dy ; the fairly constant moment of inertia in a wide spin range appears as a result of the configuration mixing in accordance with the experimental data , although the agreement is not perfect because the selfconsistent deformation is slightly overestimated .",
    "the calculated inertias by the simple projection from one cranked hfb state with various frequencies decrease as spin increases in this case ; the one with the non - cranked hfb state is almost constant but its absolute value is only about 70% of the calculated inertia by the projected configuration mixing .",
    "the feature that the calculated inertias decrease is also observed in the ground state rotational band of the unstable neutron - skin nucleus @xmath38 mg if calculated by the simple projection from one cranked hfb state . in these two cases , the superdeformed band of @xmath39dy and the ground state band of @xmath38 mg , the pairing correlation vanishes for both neutrons and protons ; the reduction of inertia may be related to this feature .    in all three examples , the semiclassical cranking moment of inertia",
    "is compared with the calculated inertia by the projected configuration mixing . in the superdeformed band of @xmath39dy and the ground state band of @xmath38",
    "mg the two inertias agrees quite well . in the ground state band of @xmath37er , however , the cranking inertia more rapidly increases than the one calculated by the projected configuration mixing , and their difference reaches about 20% at higher spins .",
    "thus only the results of the projected multi - cranked configuration mixing are in accordance with the experimental data and clearly indicate the importance of configuration mixing .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was discussed that the superposition with respect to both the position and velocity as generating coordinates is necessary in order to reproduce the correct inertial mass for the center - of - mass motion ; the so - called `` double projection ''  @xcite .",
    "the prescription of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptanz ] ) is its natural extension to the collective rotational motion  @xcite .",
    "although the inertial mass for rotation is not known _ a priori _ , the result of the present work shows that the inclusion of the effect of cranking , i.e. , superposing the wave functions with different angular velocities , is very important .",
    "in fact , as it was already stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the moment of inertia calculated by the simple projection from the non - cranked ( time - even ) hfb state is too small .",
    "the calculated inertia considerably increases if the projection is performed from a cranked hfb state with small cranking frequency ; it is the crudest approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptanz ] ) , i.e. , the frequency integration is approximated by only one point .",
    "when the number of points is increased the result of the projected configuration mixing converges independently of the chosen set of cranking frequencies , which is natural because the procedure is a discrete approximation of the frequency integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptanz ] ) . what is surprising , however , is that the necessary number of cranked hfb states is rather small and the procedure is tractable , which is an important consequence of the present work",
    ".    it may be worth mentioning that the behavior of convergence when increasing the number of randomly chosen configurations for @xmath37er is considerably different from those for @xmath38 mg and @xmath39dy .",
    "moreover , the necessary number of configurations for convergence is largest in the case of @xmath37er . although we do not understand the definite reason for this behavior , it may be most probably related to the presence of pairing correlations .",
    "we have shown that the superposition with respect to the cranking frequency is a key for a reliable description of the collective rotation by employing the angular momentum projection method .",
    "the projected shell model  @xcite is also based on the projection and the configuration mixing , but does not rely on the cranking model : it utilizes much larger but simple configurations in a sense of the shell model , i.e. , two , four , and , if necessary , higher numbers of quasiparticle excited configurations associated with the deformed and superconducting mean - field .",
    "we believe that the cranking model is an efficient way to incorporate the multi - quasiparticle excitations suitable for describing the collective rotation . to understand the mutual relationship between the projected shell model and the multi - cranked configuration mixing in the present work may be an interesting future problem .",

    "<S> it is found that the spectrum as a result of the configuration mixing does not essentially depend on chosen sets of cranking frequencies if the number of mean - field states utilized in the mixing is larger than a certain small value . </S>",
