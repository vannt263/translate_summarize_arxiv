    "<S> we report a novel monte carlo scheme that greatly enhances the power of parallel - tempering simulations . in this method , we boost the accumulation of statistical averages by including information about all potential parallel tempering trial moves , rather than just those trial moves that are accepted . as a test , we compute the free - energy landscape for conformational changes in simple model proteins . with the new technique , </S>",
    "<S> the sampled region of the configurational space in which the free - energy landscape could be reliably estimated , increases by a factor 20 .    </S>",
    "<S> the exponential increase in the speed of computers during the past decades has made it possible to perform simulations that were utterly unfeasible one generation ago . </S>",
    "<S> but in many cases , the development of more efficient algorithms has been at least as important .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most widely used schemes to simulate many - body systems is the markov - chain monte carlo method ( mcmc ) that was introduced in 1953 by metropolis et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this algorithm the average properties of a system </S>",
    "<S> are estimated by performing a random walk in the configurational space , where each state is sampled with a frequency proportional to its boltzmann weight . in the metropolis algorithm , this is achieved by attempting random moves from the current state of the system to a new state . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the ratio of the boltzmann weights of the new and the old states , these trial moves may be either accepted or rejected . </S>",
    "<S> metropolis et al . </S>",
    "<S> showed that the acceptance probability of trial moves can be chosen such that boltzmann sampling is achieved .    </S>",
    "<S> one important application of the mc method is the estimation of the landau free energy @xmath0 of the system as function of some order parameter @xmath1.\\ ] ] there are many situations where the mcmc method does not yield an accurate estimate of @xmath0 , because it fails to explore configuration space efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> this is , for instance , the case in `` glassy '' systems that tend to get trapped for long times in small pockets of configuration space . in the early 1990 s </S>",
    "<S> the so - called parallel - tempering ( pt ) technique was introduced to speed up the sampling in such systems  @xcite .    in a parallel - tempering monte </S>",
    "<S> carlo simulation , @xmath2 simulations of a particular model system are carried out in parallel at different temperatures ( or other at different values of some other thermodynamic field , such as the chemical potential or a biasing potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> each of these copies of the system is called replica . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the regular mc trial moves , one occasionally attempts to swap the temperatures of a pair of these systems ( say @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the swapping move between temperature @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is accepted or rejected according to a criterion that guarantees detailed balance , e.g. : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the difference of the inverse of swapping temperatures , and @xmath7 is the energy difference of the two configurations . </S>",
    "<S> although there are other valid acceptance rules , we used the one in eq.[paralletempering ] because it was easy to implement .    to facilitate the sampling of high free - energy states,difficult  regions , we use the adaptive umbrella sampling @xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> ( iterative ) scheme , a biasing potential is constructed using the histogram of the states , sampled during an iteration as follows @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the biasing potential function of an order parameter @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the iteration number , @xmath12 is a constant that controls the rate of convergence of @xmath9 ( a typical value for @xmath12 is @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> after iteration , @xmath9 converges to the landau free energy . as a consequence , @xmath15 becomes essentially flat and the biased sampling explores a larger fraction of the configuration space . during the mc sampling , </S>",
    "<S> we include the bias , and only at the end of the simulation we compute the free energy @xmath16 from @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the probability of observing a state characterized by the order parameter @xmath10 , and @xmath19 is the biasing potential of the last iteration computed at temperature @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> . combined with parallel tempering , the acceptance rule for the temperature swapping move is then @xmath20 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are replica indices , and @xmath11 is the iteration number . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this scheme as apt ( adaptive parallel tempering ) @xcite .    in the conventional mcmc method all information about rejected trial moves is discarded . </S>",
    "<S> recently one of us has proposed a scheme that makes it possible to include the contributions of rejected configurations in the sampling of averages  @xcite . in the present paper , we show how this approach can be used to increase the power of the parallel - tempering scheme .    in this scheme </S>",
    "<S> , we only retain information about pt moves that have been accepted . however , in the spirit of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can include the contribution of all pt trial moves , irrespective of whether they are accepted . </S>",
    "<S> the weight of the contribution of such a virtual move is directly related to its acceptance probability . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if we use the symmetric acceptance rule for mc trial moves , then the weights of the original and new ( trial ) state in the sampling of virtual moves are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is defined in eq.[eq : pt bias ] . </S>",
    "<S> we are not limited to a single trial swap of state @xmath3 with a given state @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we can include all possible trial swaps between the temperature state @xmath3 and all @xmath23 remaining temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate for the contribution to the probability distribution @xmath24 corresponding to temperature @xmath3 is then given by the following sum @xmath25 where the delta functions select the configurations with order parameter @xmath10 . as we now combine the parallel tempering algorithm with a set of parallel virtual moves , we refer to the present scheme as virtual - move parallel tempering ( vmpt ) .    to measure the efficiency of vmpt , we computed the free energy landscape of a simple lattice - protein model . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> interaction with a substrate can induce a conformational change in the proteins . </S>",
    "<S> for the same system we had already explored the use of the conventional adaptive pt scheme  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the model protein that we consider represents a heteropolymer containing 80 amino acids , while the substrate has a fixed space arrangement and contains 40 residues , see fig.[cap : test - conformations ] . </S>",
    "<S> the configurational energy of the system is defined as @xmath26,\\label{conformationalenergy}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 run over the residues of the protein , while @xmath27 runs only over the elements of the substrate , @xmath28 is the contact defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the interaction matrix . for @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> we use the 20 by 20 matrix fitted by miyazawa and jernigan @xcite on the basis of the frequency of contacts between each pair of amino acids in nature .    </S>",
    "<S> we change the identity of the amino acids along the chain by `` point mutations '' which , in this context , means : changes of a single amino acid . </S>",
    "<S> in doing so we explore the sequence space of the protein and the substrate , and we minimize at the same time the configurational energy of the system in two distinct configurations , one bound ( fig.[cap : test - conformations].a ) and one unbound ( fig.[cap : test - conformations].b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the design scheme is the same as used in ref.@xcite . in this scheme , </S>",
    "<S> trial mutations are accepted if the monte carlo acceptance criterion is satisfied for both configurations .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of the design process is a model protein that has the ability to change its conformation when bound to the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the sampling of the configurations is performed with three basic moves : corner - flip , crankshaft , branch rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the corner - flip involves a rotation of 180 degrees of a given particle around the line joining its neighbors along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the crankshaft move is a rotation by 90 degrees of two consecutive particles . </S>",
    "<S> a branch rotation is a turn , around a randomly chosen pivot particle , of the whole section starting from the pivot particle and going to the end of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> for all these moves we use a symmetric acceptance rule with the addition of the biasing potential calculated with the umbrella sampling scheme ( eq.[eq : muticanonical ] ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy difference between the new and the old state ( eq.[conformationalenergy ] ) , and @xmath22 is the difference in the bias potential from the same states ( eq.[eq : muticanonical ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we sample the free energy , as a function of two order parameters , of which the first is the conformational energy defined in eq.[conformationalenergy ] , and the second is the difference of the number of contacts belonging to two reference structures ( e.g. 1 and 2 ) i.e. @xmath34\\,,\\label{orderparameter}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the contact maps of the reference structures , and @xmath37 is the contact map of the instantaneous configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter that measures the change in the number of native contacts is defined as follows : as we consider two distinct native states , we take these as the reference structures . every contact that occurs to state 1 </S>",
    "<S> has a value and every contact that belongs to structure 2 has a value @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> contacts that appear in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 , or do not appear in neither of the two , do not contribute to the order parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason why we assign negative values to native contacts of structure 2 , is that we compute the free energy difference between the protein in configuration 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> if we would have assigned 0 to the contacts of structure 2 then we would not have been able to distinguish it from unfolded configurations that do no have any native contacts at all . for our specific case , @xmath35 represents the structure in fig.[cap : test - conformations].a , while @xmath36corresponds to the one shown in fig.[cap : test - conformations].b , and @xmath10 has values between -15 and 30 . because the number of native contacts includes the contacts with the substrate of the reference state , it can be used to compute the free energy difference between the unbound state and the specifically bound one .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed 15 simulations , 5 of them with vmpt ( using the parameters in tab.[cap : resumetable].i ) and the other 10 with apt ( 5 using the parameters in tab.[cap : resumetable].i , and 5 with the parameters in tab.[cap : resumetable].ii ) . in fig.[cap : comparisong-1 ] we compare the average free energies at @xmath41 ( with error bars ) . in this figure , we only show those free energies that were sampled in all the 5 simulations of each group . from the figure it is clear that the vmpt approach leads to a much better sampling of the free - energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the vmpt approach becomes even more obvious if we plot the free energy `` landscape '' as function of two order parameters ( viz . the conformational energy ( eq.[conformationalenergy ] ) and the number of native contacts ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this case the apt method is almost useless as only small fragments of the free - energy landscape can be reconstructed . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of points sampled with vmpt is 20 times larger than with apt , and the energy range that is probed , is one order of magnitude larger ( see fig.[cap:3d - comparison ] ) .    to check the accuracy of the vmpt method </S>",
    "<S> , we compared the average free energy obtained by apt and vmpt at high temperatures where the apt scheme works reasonably well . as can be seen in fig.[cap : comparison-2 ] the two methods agree well in this regime ( be it that a much longer apt simulation was needed ) . </S>",
    "<S> even though the apt runs required 20 times more mc cycles , it still probes about 30% less of the free - energy landscape than the vmpt scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> as the implementation described above is not based on a particular feature of the system under study , the results obtained in this study suggest that the vmpt method may be useful for the study of any system that is normally simulated using parallel tempering . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the application of parallel tempering in fully atomistic simulations of protein folding can be found in refs .  </S>",
