    "let us consider two galaxies separated from each other by the vector @xmath1 .",

    "we study probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are respectively defined as radial and transverse components of the pairwise velocity ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the radial pairwise velocity is of fundamental importance in observational cosmology ( peebles 1993 , section 20 ) .",
    "it serves as a probe of the matter distribution .",
    "its pdf is essential to converting observed data in the redshift space into those in the real space .    for the quasi - nonlinear regime of the present - day universe ( @xmath12@xmath13 mpc )",
    ", @xmath0-body numerical simulations have shown that the radial - velocity pdf exhibits a negative average and negatively skewed pronounced tails ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; fisher et al . 1994 ; zurek et al . 1994 ; magira , jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "these properties are attributable to coherent motions of galaxies approaching each other , since gravitational clustering is the predominant process in the quasi - nonlinear regime .",
    "however , with the results of _",
    "n_-body simulations alone , we can not understand how the negative average , negative skewness and pronounced tails of the radial - velocity pdf are related with gravitational clustering . to clarify this relation ,",
    "an analytical treatment is desirable .    the linear perturbation , i.e. , the most convenient analytic tool , in insufficient to study the above - mentioned properties of the radial - velocity pdf .",
    "this is because these properties are nonlinear .",
    "the linear perturbation merely amplifies peculiar velocities of all the galaxies by the same factor .",
    "thus the radial - velocity pdf retains its gaussianity in the initial stage , where motions of the individual galaxies are random and independent . although the leading terms of the average @xmath14 and standard deviation @xmath15 happen to be squares of the linear perturbation , those of the higher - order moments , e.g. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are nonlinear perturbations ( see juszkiewicz , fisher & szapudi 1998 ) .",

    "however , the pdf was obtained with a conventional but unjustified ansatz , instead of the rigorous theory that requires complicated calculations .",
    "seto & yokoyama ( 1998 ) used a first - order lagrangian perturbation , i.e. , the zeldovich approximation ( za ; zeldovich 1970 ) . although their radial - velocity pdf exhibits pronounced tails , they failed to reproduce the negative average and had to shift their pdf by hand in order to achieve agreement with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "overall , the mechanism that determines the radial - velocity pdf is still controversial .",
    "we use za to reexamine the pdf .",
    "it would be surprising if za really reproduced the pronounced tails but not the negative average @xmath14 .",
    "the former is associated with the higher moments such as @xmath17 . for the quasi - nonlinear regime ,",
    "za is a good approximation ( yoshisato , matsubara & morikawa 1998 ) .",
    "each of the galaxies is assumed to move along the gravitational force that is determined by the initial density distribution .",
    "thus the galaxies cluster together .",
    "the velocity and density fields undergo a nonlinear evolution , which is expected to cause the negative average , negative skewness and pronounced tails of the radial - velocity pdf .",
    "we have to be careful about the extent to which za can describe gravitational clustering .",
    "of particular importance is the range of the separation @xmath18 where za is applicable .",
    "it has been known that za is applicable only to a limited range , but the applicable range has not been estimated so far .",

    "although the same formulation was adopted in seto & yokoyama ( 1998 ) , we give a more complete description for our discussion in sections 3 and 5 .",
    "the basic assumption is that the initial density fluctuation is random gaussian while the initial peculiar - velocity field is homogeneous , isotropic , random and vorticity - free .",
    "since the initial density fluctuation is random gaussian , the corresponding pdf of the radial and transverse velocities is also gaussian ( fisher 1995 ) , @xmath51 . \\label{pdfini6}\\ ] ] thus we only have to obtain the dispersions of the initial pairwise velocities @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the averages @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not have to be considered because they vanish in the limit @xmath56 .",
