    "<S> we question whether the canonical estimate of a strong coupling , @xmath0 , is always appropriate for dynamical symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion is motivated by the success of naive quark models in describing low energy qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite has emerged as a practical tool for estimating the dimensionless parameters appearing in a low energy effective theory when the underlying theory is strongly - coupled . </S>",
    "<S> the basic reasonable assumption is that the effective theory should reflect the strongly - interacting nature of the underlying theory , so that loop corrections in the effective theory should be as large as tree level effects . </S>",
    "<S> this yields estimates for coefficients of operators in the effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> such estimates turn out to work rather well for low energy qcd , and since the basic idea seems very general , it is natural to apply it to other types of strong interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> central to the application of nda is an estimate of the size of coupling in a strongly - coupled theory . </S>",
    "<S> the canonical estimate is @xmath1 , since it is for this coupling that all orders of the loop expansion are expected to be of similar size . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to @xmath0 as a truly strong coupling , and in the absence of any small expansion parameter , the parameters appearing in the low energy effective theory are truly incalculable in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> nda is the best that can be done in the absence of a true nonperturbative calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> we will suggest that symmetry breaking physics need not always be truly strong in the following sense . </S>",
    "<S> it may be that symmetry breaking physics can at times leave a recognizable imprint on the low energy theory , an imprint not completely obscured by nonperturbative effects and reflecting the details of the underlying theory . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that a coupling which is not truly strong is consistent with the nonperturbative  strongly - coupled \" effects underlying the dynamical symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this may be the situation for qcd , such that the success of nda estimates can be reconciled with the success of naive quark model estimates in low energy qcd . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion does not challenge the basic notion of nda .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with an example which illustrates the possibility of symmetry breaking physics without a truly strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we look at a chiral gauge theory and compare nda with some other standard lore , namely that which follows from the ladder schwinger - dyson analysis ( lsda ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter relies on a one gauge boson approximation to the sd equation . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most familiar chiral gauge theories is @xmath2 with fermion content @xmath3 . at strong enough couplings </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that condensates in the channels @xmath4 will occur , since these are the most attractive channels for the respective pairs of fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lsda gives the critical couplings needed for these condensates as @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we may take the first as the critical coupling for the symmetry breaking @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( whether the second condensate is considered to arise from the @xmath2 interactions or the unbroken @xmath8 interactions is a matter of taste . ) far below the @xmath2 breaking scale and the @xmath8 confining scale all degrees of freedom have decoupled from the low energy theory except for one fermion . </S>",
    "<S> this is the @xmath8 singlet component of the original @xmath9 fermion multiplet , the left - handed field @xmath10 , whose masslessness is protected by an unbroken global symmetry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the critical couplings obtained from lsda are well below @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> lsda implies that the sum of ladder graphs in specific attractive channels is sufficient to produce dynamical symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is strongly - coupled in the sense that the symmetry breaking effect is nonperturbative ; graphs at all orders are contributing . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepency with nda is simply in the value of the critical coupling in lsda , which is less than truly strong .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to dismiss the naive lsda results , based as they are on the assumption of a constant coupling . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand we may associate this constant coupling with the value of the true running coupling when smeared or averaged over the dominant range of momenta in loops . </S>",
    "<S> the basic point then is that the lsda result is presumably reasonable if higher order corrections to the ladder sum are small , which may follow if the coupling is indeed not truly strong . in fact this is consistent with explicit calculations of next order corrections to the lsda , where relatively small corrections are found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the lsda results appear to be self - consistent .    </S>",
    "<S> dynamical symmetry breaking in theories which are not truly strong would clearly have implications for the resulting low energy effective theories . in the present example </S>",
    "<S> the exchange of a massive @xmath2 gauge boson generates the following interaction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 but by nda the effective action of the low energy theory should be of the following form , where all dimensionless parameters appearing in the lagrangian are of order unity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 the set of terms in ( [ a ] ) could be consistent with ( [ b ] ) only if the following relations were true . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 if we assume that ( [ g ] ) is true then the nda estimate of the overall size of the four - fermion operators ( rhs of ( [ h ] ) ) is 144 times larger than the lsda estimate ( the lhs ) ! part of the blame for this large discrepancy surely lies in lsda , which ignores the fact that the @xmath2 coupling is running quite quickly near the @xmath2 breaking scale . thus </S>",
    "<S> even though some smeared value of the coupling appropriate for loop integrations may be close to @xmath15 , the @xmath16 appearing in ( [ a ] ) is likely an underestimate . on the other hand for chiral gauge theories with walking couplings , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding effect would be smaller .    the large range in possible estimates for the size of four - fermion operators does not contradict the order - of - magnitude estimates of nda . </S>",
    "<S> but the implication from lsda , and a coupling which is not truly strong , is that the effect of loop corrections can presumably be quite modest . </S>",
    "<S> the specific form of the four - fermion interactions in ( [ a ] ) for example can remain as a clear imprint on the low energy theory .    in the above example the mass of the heavy boson set the scale for the momentum expansion , whereas in the next example involving a heavy fermion the situation is a little different . </S>",
    "<S> consider a standard nonlinear @xmath17-model with a triplet of massless pions coupled to a degenerate fermion doublet of mass @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 the model has local @xmath20 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> when used as a model for low energy qcd , color is introduced as a global symmetry where each quark comes in @xmath21 colors . </S>",
    "<S> the fermions may be integrated out to yield the low energy theory for the massless pions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this is a theory with two independent mass terms , the @xmath22 mass and the @xmath23 mass . </S>",
    "<S> the pion kinetic term containing the latter can not be removed due to the infinite renormalization from the fermion loop .    </S>",
    "<S> but we are still able to study the finite higher order terms in the momentum expansion of the fermion loop . </S>",
    "<S> we consider momentum expansions for the @xmath24 two - point function and the electromagnetic pion form factor . @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> both form factors are defined such that @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the model in fact produces the same result for the two form factors for any @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 if we consider the momentum expansion of this result in the form @xmath29 we find that the @xmath30 are significantly less than unity , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) for @xmath30 up to high @xmath31 . instead of using @xmath18 as the mass scale in the momentum expansion , </S>",
    "<S> a choice @xmath32 would work better for the lower orders , while @xmath33 ( the threshold for pair production ) would work better for the very high orders . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the mass scale appearing in the momentum expansion and its connection to the fermion mass is relevant for the next example , which is closer in spirit to qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> the model here will have only one independent mass parameter so that the coupling strength @xmath34 is determined . </S>",
    "<S> the independence of @xmath35 and @xmath18 in the previous model is related to the infinite renormalization , which in turn is a consequence of the momentum independence of the fermion mass . </S>",
    "<S> we will therefore look at a model which incorporates a momentum dependent fermion mass function , which is expected in any case when the fermion mass has a dynamical origin . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal model @xcite which incorporates the same local chiral gauge symmetries as ( [ d ] ) is obtained by removing the @xmath36 term in ( [ d ] ) and making the following replacement . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is the fourier transform of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> when the latter function falls for large @xmath40 in the way appropriate for qcd , the fermion loop generates a finite contribution to the @xmath41 term .    </S>",
    "<S> the new quark propagator is @xmath42 . after expanding the quark loop in external momentum and wick rotating , </S>",
    "<S> we are left with an integral over euclidean momentum @xmath43 . since the integral </S>",
    "<S> is dominated for @xmath44 we choose the normalization condition @xmath45 in order for the new propagator to resemble @xmath46 in the dominant momentum region . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath18 is again the typical mass parameter of the underlying theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the proper normalization of the @xmath36 term yields the pagels - stokar @xcite relation . @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> a convenient choice for @xmath48 is @xmath49 and we shall present results for the values @xmath50 .. ] @xmath51 around 2 or 3 does a good job of reproducing the observed parameters at order @xmath52 , @xmath53@xmath54 , of low energy qcd ( after current quark masses are added to the model ) . </S>",
    "<S> combining ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) yields the following set of couplings @xmath34 , which do not display extreme sensitivity to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55    we again consider the form factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are no longer equal . if we expand both form factors in the way suggested by nda , @xmath58 we find the following results for the expansion parameters @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 @xmath61 we see a tendency for @xmath59 to decrease for increasing @xmath31 , but to the extent that the @xmath59 are close to unity , the results are fairly consistent with the expectations of nda for a strongly - interacting , effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> their values would suggest that the fundamental mass scale in the underlying theory is somewhat larger than @xmath62 , and that the underlying theory has coupling somewhat larger than @xmath63 . on the other hand , @xmath64 and @xmath63 are somewhat larger than the mass @xmath18 and coupling @xmath34 actually appearing in the underlying theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable from the previous example , where we learned that the mass of the fermion in the loop is not the appropriate scale for the momentum expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now return to the question of how it is that both nda and naive quark models , such as the one above , are both successful in describing low energy qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that what appears to be a strongly - interacting low energy theory is emerging from an underlying theory with a smaller than expected coupling . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this coupling , @xmath34 , in the model is very similar to the size of the gauge coupling , @xmath65 , which emerges from the ladder schwinger - dyson equation analysis of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> thus the idea of symmetry breaking arising for couplings less than the truly strong coupling @xmath66 emerges again here , as it did for our first example . </S>",
    "<S> support for this idea appears in the observed form of the chiral lagrangian of qcd , which seems to display the imprint of some rather trivial physics . </S>"
