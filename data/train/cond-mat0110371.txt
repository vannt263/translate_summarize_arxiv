    "neutron scattering has been demonstrated as an extremely useful probe of the spin fluctuations @xmath13 near the curie temperature of heisenberg ferromagnets @xcite . under the assumption that the _ isotropic exchange interaction _ dominates the ordering process , the early results could be well interpreted in terms of the dynamical scaling hypothesis @xcite . in its simplest form",
    "this hypothesis states that as for the static spin correlations also the temperature and @xmath2-dependencies of their characteristic frequencies are described by homogeneous scaling functions that depend only on a single variable , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the correlation length of the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "signatures of the inevitable , _ anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction _ on the fluctuations of heisenberg ferromagnets have been first detected by measurements of the relaxation rate @xmath16 of the homogeneous @xmath17 mode in the _ paramagnetic _ phase of @xmath18 @xcite and subsequently also of fe by neutron spin - echo measurements at small q @xcite .",
    "based on these signatures and also on first theoretical approaches , which treated the dipolar interaction as a perturbation of the isotropic fluctuations @xcite , it has been conjectured @xcite that the dipolar forces should gain importance somewhere in the socalled dipolar critical ( dc ) regime , where @xmath19 and q are small compared to the dipolar wavenumber @xmath6 ( see fig.[geometry]a ) . for a given ferromagnet ,",
    "this quantity measures the strength of the dipolar interaction relative to the exchange interactions .",
    "it has been introduced in renormalization group ( rg ) calculations of the static correlation functions @xcite , recognizing that the dipolar anisotropy breaks the rotational invariance of the fluctuations @xmath20 with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the demagnetizing effect of the dipolar interaction on the longitudinal modes @xmath21 , prevents them from becoming critical , while the remaining two transverse modes ( see fig.[geometry]c ) are driving the ferromagnetic transition . at first these dipolar anisotropic fluctuations",
    "have been realized by elastic scattering of polarized neutrons above @xmath22 of the heisenberg ferromagnets euo and eus @xcite , where for the latter it was also possible to measure directly the characteristic wavenumber , @xmath23 .        on the theoretical side ,",
    "the implications of the dipolar critical fluctuations on their dynamics have been fully taken into account only by the mode - mode coupling ( mmc ) , approach @xcite .",
    "_ above @xmath22 _ , rather convincing agreement was obtained @xcite for the critical slowing down of @xmath24 observed for @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the transverse fluctuations of fe @xcite and eus @xcite as well as for the longitudinal ones ( @xmath27 ) of eus @xcite .",
    "additional strong support for the mmc - results came from quantitative analyses of the relaxation rates @xmath28 in the two limiting cases @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the archetype heisenberg ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "as one of the striking results we mention the crossover from @xmath31 in the exchange dominated regime to @xmath32 , deep in the dipolar one @xcite .",
    "the latter behavior corresponds to the conventional ( van hove type ) slowing down , characterized by a non - critical onsager coefficient of the spin dynamics , @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 is the static susceptibility of the transverse fluctuations .",
    "it was shown that this central quantity depends in a universal manner only on @xmath22 and @xmath6 , to be discussed in sect.[discussion ] .    _ below @xmath22 _ , the situation becomes more complicated because the symmetry of the fluctuations is further reduced by the appearance of the order parameter , i.e. the spontaneous magnetization @xmath4 . as illustrated in fig.[geometry]b",
    ", it is common sense to distinguish there between the spin waves @xmath35 and the longitudinal modes @xmath36 .",
    "a systematic classification of critical behaviors in the @xmath37-plane , which considers the heisenberg exchange and the dipolar interaction on an equal footing , has recently been performed by schinz and schwabl @xcite . according to their results ,",
    "we have depicted the dipolar critical ( dc ) regime in fig.[geometry]a , which apart from a dipolar hydodynamic ( dh ) regime at rather small q is bound from above by the dipolar wavenumber @xmath6 in q - direction as well as in the @xmath5-direction .    since among the archetypical heisenberg ferromagnets",
    "@xmath6 is largest for eus @xcite , this material is preferred for experimental studies of dipolar effects @xcite .",
    "here we report results of a first systematic study of the magnetization dynamics in the dc - region , which covers the shaded area in fig.[geometry]a .",
    "our principal goal is to determine the susceptibilities and linewidths of the spin waves and of the longitudinal fluctuations and to examine their q- and temperature variations .",
    "the experimental access by means of inelastic scattering of polarized neutrons around a finite bragg peak is described in section [ experiment ] .",
    "as illustrated by fig.[geometry]b we choose a configuration where the momentum transfer * q * occurs in directions perpendicular to the order parameter @xmath4 , which allows to define and determine the transverse polarizations of the spin wave and of the longitudinal modes with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "this will turn out to be essential for the discussion by means of dynamical scaling , because the appearance of the order parameter does not lift the symmetry with respect to @xmath38 so that both modes retain their transverse polarization from above @xmath22 . in section [ results ] , we give some examples for constant * q*-scans and the analysis of the inelastic cross section .",
    "we evaluate there the relevant observables , i.e. static susceptibilities , the spin wave frequencies and the linewidths .",
    "their detailed temperature and q - variations are presented in sect .",
    "[ analysis ] .",
    "in particular , we determine there the dipolar wavenumber @xmath6 from spin wave energies and the correlation length @xmath39 of the longitudinal fluctuations from their static susceptibilities . backed with these findings",
    ", we discuss the central results .",
    "i.e. the damping of the spin waves and of the longitudinal fluctuations , in sect.[discussion ] . here",
    "the objectives are twofold .",
    "first , basing on the existing data for the paramagnetic side of eus we want to examine whether and how the scaling hypothesis , which is rather special for the dipolar interaction @xcite , works , and second we will compare our results to the rather detailed predictions of the recent numerical solutions of mmc equations @xcite . to produce explicit values for the linewidth , this mmc approach had to introduce several assumptions which , of course , need to be checked by the experiment .",
    "the paper closes with a brief summary and outlook .",
    "the neutron scattering experiments were performed using the triple axis spectrometer in14 at the ill in grenoble , with polarization analysis .",
    "the isotopically enriched sample @xmath40eus was composed of roughly 100 single crystals , aligned such that the overall mosaic was @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ mosaic ] ) . in eus the magnetic @xmath42 ions ( @xmath43 )",
    "are arranged on a face centered cubic lattice , @xmath44 .",
    "the sample was mounted inside a superconducting magnet providing vertical fields @xmath45 up to 4.5  t. all measurements were conducted near the ( 200 ) bragg peak with @xmath2 along the [ h00 ] direction ( see fig.[geometry]b ) using neutrons with fixed incident energies @xmath46 and 3.8 mev and collimations 37-37-40 along the beam direction from the monochromator to the detector .",
    "due to the mosaic structure of the sample shown in fig.[mosaic ] the measurements in the other * q*-direction suffered from a high background from the elastic bragg intensity .",
    "the neutron cross section for neutrons scattered from an isotropic magnetic material is given by @xcite @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the total momentum and energy transfers from the neutron to the sample , respectively , where @xmath50 is the neutron energy .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 designate the cartesian components @xmath53 , @xmath54 barn/@xmath55 , @xmath56 is the magnetic form factor for the eu@xmath57 ion , the exponential term is the debye - waller factor , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the number of the magnetic ions in the sample .",
    "the reduced momentum transfer is defined by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the position of the nearest bragg peak , @xmath62 in our case , ( fig .",
    "[ geometry]b ) .",
    "the @xmath63-component of the scattering function @xmath64 is related to the imaginary part of the susceptibility by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath65 where the thermal population factor is given by @xmath66^{-1}$ ] .",
    "our experiments have been conducted close to the curie temperature @xmath67 and at energy transfers @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 becomes directly proportional to @xmath70 @xmath71 thus , the neutron scattering cross section reflects directly the @xmath38- and @xmath72-dependence of the susceptibility components of the sample .    according to eq.([crose ] ) , the neutrons couple only to spin fluctuations @xmath73 that are perpendicular to the scattering vector @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the cross section contains contributions from the longitudinal fluctuations @xmath75 and from the spin wave scattering that corresponds to excitations with @xmath76 perpendicular to @xmath77 .",
    "both modes have a transverse polarization with respect to @xmath2 , and in the following we omit the superscript t. the fluctuations parallel to @xmath77 can be separated from the spin wave modes by analyzing the polarization @xmath78 of the scattered neutrons with respect to the incident polarization , @xmath79 . as can be inferred from fig.[geometry]b ,",
    "the parallel fluctuations give rise to non - spin flip scattering and the spin wave modes give rise to spin flip scattering .",
    "therefore , the susceptibilities @xmath80 and @xmath81 of both magnetic modes , can be determined unambiguously in a vertical field @xmath82 . in order to minimize the influence of the magnetic field on the spin fluctuations as much as possible , we adjusted @xmath82 so that the internal magnetic field @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , was small , however large enough to remove the domain walls .",
    "the flipping ratio was between @xmath85 .    in a first step ,",
    "all the measured data @xmath86 was corrected for the finite flipping ratio @xmath87 according to : @xmath88 + @xmath89 where @xmath90 designates the scattered intensity from the polarization @xmath91 to the polarization @xmath92 of the incident and scattered neutrons , respectively . in a second step ,",
    "a background being determined in the paramagnetic phase at @xmath93 k @xmath94 and in the ordered phase at @xmath95 k , was subtracted from the data .",
    "the energy - independent contribution was 1 count/8.3 min for all the measurements in the range @xmath96 @xcite , where the reduced momentum transfer is measured in reciprocal lattice units @xmath97 .",
    "the peak intensity of the elastic background was 4 counts/8.3 min and 8 counts / min for the spin - flip and non - spin - flip scattering at the position @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "the inelastic magnetic scattering has been determined at several temperatures and momentum transfers by performing constant-@xmath99 scans .",
    "[ qscan18 ] shows the cross sections at @xmath100 as measured along the [ 100 ] direction at the ( 2 0 0 ) bragg reflection at @xmath101 k in a field @xmath102 mt .",
    "the spin - flip data clearly reveals spin waves , while the non - spin flip data is quasielastic and has a width ( half - width at half maximum ) that is roughly a factor of two smaller than the energy of the spin waves .",
    "similar data was collected for many different temperatures @xmath103 k and in appropriate fields 30 mt @xmath104 500 mt , as described in section [ experiment ] .    scattering of polarized neutrons is a very efficient way to properly separate the longitudinal from the transverse excitations in an heisenberg ferromagnet .",

    "[ qscan18]a , b : @xmath105 as it would be measured by means of unpolarized neutrons .",
    "the comparison shows clearly that the longitudinal scattering can not be reliably extracted by means of unpolarized neutrons because the spectral widths of @xmath106 and @xmath107 are similar .",
    "moreover , reliable positions and widths of the spin waves can only be obtained if polarized beam data is used .    in order to analyze the data we have employed the scattering function , eq.([crose ] ) , which via eq.([fdtsimple ] )",
    "is directly related to the dynamical susceptibilities @xmath108 and @xmath109 . to allow for a comparison between our results and the existing theory @xcite",
    ", we assume lorentzian spectral weight functions for the dynamic susceptibilities of the modes @xmath110 and obtain    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the spin wave energy and @xmath113 are the linewidths . as the scattering from the longitudinal fluctuations proves to be quasielastic , we set @xmath114 .",
    "the data was fitted by convoluting the scattering functions @xmath115 with the four - dimensional resolution function of the spectrometer to give @xmath116 .",
    "the three parameters @xmath117 and a common normalization parameter were varied for each constant-*q * scan such that @xmath118 was minimized .",

    "they describe the data well .",
    "figure  [ qdeppft ] shows that the width of the longitudinal fluctuations @xmath119 increases with increasing @xmath120 in qualitative agreement with existing theories @xcite .",
    "a more detailed comparison will be performed in the discussion .",
    "from the fits of the spectra using the double lorentzian scattering function , eq .",

    "these quantities will be discussed in the following .          in order to compare the experimentally determined static susceptibilities with the theory we refer to the expressions from the theoretical work by schinz and schwabl @xcite who have presented @xmath125 for all q - values and temperatures below @xmath22 .",
    "especially , one finds for the susceptibilities @xmath109 and @xmath108 , deep in the dipolar regime as covered by our experiment ( fig.[geometry]a ) : @xmath126    @xmath127        the @xmath128-divergence is characteristic of gapless spin waves with transverse polarization @xmath129 , also referred to as goldstone modes , while the fluctuations parallel to @xmath77 acquire a ( thermal ) mass , @xmath130 . at small momentum transfers",
    "@xmath131 , this term is renormalized by the spin wave fluctuations and becomes q - dependent    @xmath132    [ kappam ]    where @xmath133 denotes the inverse correlation length below @xmath22 and @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this effect has been emphasized for the homogeneous susceptibility already in the original spin wave work by holstein and primakoff @xcite .",
    "they predicted the singularity for vanishing magnetic field , @xmath135 , which in fact has been confirmed in experiments on eus and euo @xcite .",
    "more recently , the crossover from the ornstein - zernicke type behavior of the zero - field susceptibility to a @xmath136 singularity has been obtained by the rg theory @xcite , but a clear experimental evidence is yet lacking .",
    "a summary of our static results are depicted in fig.[invint]a , where the inverse ( @xmath72-integrated ) intensities of the spin - flip and non - spin - flip channels measured at five different temperatures are plotted against @xmath10 .",
    "the former ones turn out to be independent of temperature and display a clearcut @xmath10-dependence as predicted by eq.([chisw ] ) for the spin wave susceptibility @xmath109 .",
    "note that by using a representation of @xmath137 , which involves the spin wave stiffness @xmath138 , see ref . and",
    "eq.(7 ) below , one finds an equivalent form , @xmath139 . in fig.[invint]a , at the lowest @xmath10 a slight offset is seen , @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "we ascribe it to the presence of a small gap in the spin wave spectrum , which may be associated with the small cubic anisotropy of eus and the finite internal field required to remove the domains .",
    "in contrast to @xmath109 , the susceptibility of the parallel fluctuations exhibits a strong temperature dependence .",
    "figure [ invint]a displays the fits of the inverse intensities to eq.([chiz ] ) . at large @xmath10 ,",
    "the ornstein - zernicke behavior is obeyed which by eq.(5a ) defines the inverse ferromagnetic correlation length @xmath142 , depicted in fig.[invint]b .",
    "obviously , the temperature dependence can be well described by the critical law , @xmath143 with @xmath144k .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath145 agrees with the value obtained above @xmath22 of eus , @xmath146 @xcite , as predicted by the static scaling hypothesis . for the critical amplitude",
    "we obtain @xmath147 . comparing this value to the amplitude of the paramagnetic correlation length of eus , @xmath148 @xcite we find @xmath149 , which is bracketed by the mean field value , @xmath150 and @xmath151  obtained by considering fluctuations @xcite .    at rather small q",
    ", we observe a downward bending of @xmath152 , which we try to associate with the crossover @xmath153 following from eq.(5a ) . though the errors are fairly large , we fitted the inverse intensities to this prediction and found a=0.20(5 ) , which agrees surprisingly well with a=2/9 predicted by various approaches @xcite .",
    "regarding the fact that the temperature variation of this @xmath154-bending is well reproduced , we believe that this constitutes the first signature of the @xmath155-singularity of @xmath156 induced by the goldstone modes .",
    "interestingly , this variation should also hold for the dipolar critical regime @xcite .",
    "the spin wave energies , normalized to the reduced spontaneous magnetization @xmath157 @xcite , are shown in fig.[dispersion ] .",
    "for the present orientation of @xmath38 being perpendicular to @xmath4 , spin wave @xcite and linear response @xcite theories predict for the q - dependence : @xmath158 as for the static susceptibility we admitted the presence of a small gap @xmath159 . due to the well - known depolarization of one of the precessing components @xmath160 , the dipolar wavenumber enters eq.([energy ] ) via @xmath161 to cause a crossover from the quadratic dispersion at @xmath162 to the linear law for @xmath163 . the solid line in fig.[dispersion ] represents the fit of the data to eq.([energy ] ) with @xmath164 and @xmath165 . by comparing this fitted dipolar wavenumber to @xmath166 as determined from paramagnetic neutron scattering @xcite",
    "suggests that this quantity is not renormalized by critical fluctuations when passing @xmath22 .",
    "such effect has been conjectured by fisher and aharony @xcite .",
    "however , some indication for the absence of such renormalizations through critical fluctuations in the dipolar regime has already been realized during a previous determination of @xmath6@xcite . there , using the _",
    "mean field _",
    "expression for the critical amplitude of the static paramagnetic susceptibility of eus , @xmath167,@xcite @xmath168 was obtained .",
    "we also note that @xmath169 is smaller by a factor of four than @xmath170 following from the longitudinal susceptibility and the measured value of @xmath171 .",
    "we relate this difference to the dipolar interaction , which invalidates the proportionality @xmath172 , as can be inferred from the results of refs ..",
    "the linewidths evaluated here are defined by the lorentzian shape which we assumed when analyzing the spectra by eq.([fitfun ] ) .",
    "note that already previous studies on powdered eus @xcite favored this shape over the gaussian and the truncated lorentzian forms .",
    "moreover , also the mmc approach @xcite determined the damping of the magnetization modes investigated here by assuming an exponential relaxation at long times , which corresponds to the lorentzian shape at not too high frequencies .",
    "the results for the widths of the spin wave peaks and of the central peak of the longitudinal fluctuations are displayed by fig.[widths ] .",
    "within the experimental errors , there is no temperature variation down to the lowest temperatures in region dc ( see shaded area in fig.[geometry]a ) .",
    "note that the errors for @xmath119 are larger than those for @xmath173 because of the smaller spectral weight of the longitudinal fluctuations , as it is seen in fig.[invint]a .",
    "as the most striking result we infer from the presentations against @xmath174 in fig.[widths ] , that ( i ) the relaxation rates of both modes obey the simple relations    [ kincoeff ] @xmath175    being indicated as solid lines in fig.[widths ] , and ( ii ) that the resulting kinetic coefficients @xmath176 and @xmath177 agree within their uncertainties . moreover , the damping of both modes remains finite with small values of this background damping , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , which will also be discussed in the next section .",
    "we start from a rather general aspect of the critical phenomena , i.e. the scaling hypothesis extended to dynamical quantities , like the relaxation rate of the order parameter @xcite . then the dipolar interaction in heisenberg ferromagnets",
    "can fully be taken into account by introducing @xmath180 as a second scaling variable @xcite in the homogeneous scaling function @xmath181 for the linewidths of the transverse modes investigated here , see fig.[geometry]b : @xmath182    let us first approach the problem from the _ paramagnetic _ side to which we designate the index @xmath183 .",
    "there according to both experiment  @xcite and mmc theory  @xcite the crossover from exchange dominated dynamics , being characterized by the exponent @xmath184 , to the dipolar critical dynamics with @xmath185 occurs deep in the dc region , i.e. for @xmath186 .",

    "we conjecture here that - similar as above @xmath22 @xcite - damping effects by the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath241 mode are picked up within the resolution of our experiment . due to the dipolar demagnetization ,",
    "these modes are uncritical ( dynamic exponent z=0 @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture is based on the fact that our background value is rather close to @xmath242 , where we have inserted ( i ) the background kinetic coefficient @xmath243 determined from the critical behavior of @xmath244 @xcite , and ( ii ) the susceptibility of the longitudinal spin wave modes , @xmath245 , which at @xmath246 transform into the longitudinal paramagnetic modes @xmath247 .",
    "it may be interesting to note that this background seems to be absent or at least significantly be reduced in the paramagnetic relaxation rate @xmath248 of ref .",
    ", depicted in fig.[widths ] .",
    "this indicates that the appearance of the order parameter increases @xmath249 while its effect on the background rate of the spin wave linewidth , @xmath250 turns out to be small .",
    "we have conducted a study of the dynamics of spin fluctuations in the ferromagnetic state of eus close to @xmath22 , where dipolar effects are expected to play a dominant role . for intensity reasons we concentrated on the spin wave and longitudinal fluctuations , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , both transverse with respect to the momentum transfer @xmath38 , which was chosen perpendicular to @xmath77 .",
    "this configuration allowed to extract from the spin wave frequencies the characteristic dipolar wavenumber @xmath6 and from the static susceptibility , @xmath253 the correlation length @xmath254 of the longitudinal fluctuations .",
    "the latter exhibits deviations from the ornstein - zernicke law at @xmath255 , which appear to be related to the predicted thermal renormalization of @xmath108 by the spin waves @xcite .",
    "this feature , though subject of rather intense research in the past years ( see e.g. references ) , has not been identified before .",
    "the reason for the observation of the mass renormalization of @xmath253 on eus can be attributed to the rather large critical amplitude @xmath256 , which allows to explore the regime @xmath257 .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation in the itinerant ferromagnet ni@xcite , where @xmath258 is almost one order of magnitude smaller .    as the central result of our study",
    ", we regard the linewidths of both modes .",
    "they display the same q - variation @xmath259 , which we explained by using the dynamical scaling hypothesis and existing data for @xmath260 of eus .",
    "apart from a small finite background for @xmath261 , which was already observed above @xmath22 in a previous work , the absolute values of both linewidths prove to be identical .",
    "moreover , the relevant kinetic coefficient @xmath189 agrees with the value obtained from the linewidths of the transverse fluctuations @xmath262 measured in the dipolar critical regime slightly above @xmath22 .",
    "this quantitative feature suggests the transformations @xmath263 and @xmath264 when passing @xmath22 from the para- to the ferromagnetic side without any change of the dynamics and thus obeying dynamical scaling - as conjectured in ref .. as a surprising feature we note that the true , i.e. temperature independent dipolar critical behavior extends so far into the static dc region explored here , see fig.[geometry]a .",
    "this contrasts to the extremely narrow regime just above @xmath22 , in which the dipolar anisotropy changes the dynamic universality class of the transverse modes from @xmath228 to @xmath185 .",
    "the observed q- and temperature variations of our linewidths are not fully consistent with predictions by the mmc - theory @xcite , which is a bit unexpected regarding the success of this approach on the paramagnetic side.@xcite    finally we should note that for intensity reasons we were not yet able to measure the crossover of @xmath239 to the hydrodynamic @xmath265 and to the exchange critical @xmath266 regime , for which some more theoretical work has been published .",
    "@xcite an even greater experimental challenge is the low intensity of the longitudinal polarizations @xmath267@xcite and @xmath268 . their non - critical dynamics may be responsible for the absence of any temperature effects on the both linewidths investigated here .",
    "other unsettled problems are the mechanisms responsible for the small and non - critical background effects occuring in the static susceptibilities , spin wave frequencies and relaxation rates .",
    "the values quoted here for @xmath269 and @xmath270 may help to answer the question whether there exists a common origin , like anisotropy or finite internal magnetic field .",
    "the energy independent background of 1 count/8.3 min seems to be unreasonably small .",
    "the reason is that the fitted spectral weight functions were approximated by lorenzians that usually enforce a too low background when fitting data as discussed in ref . ."
