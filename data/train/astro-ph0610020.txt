    "lsv+4621 is one of the brightest dao white dwarfs . several times",
    ", it has previously been analyzed , e.g. @xcite employed nlte model atmospheres composed out of h+he and determined an effective temperature of @xmath0 , a surface gravity of @xmath1 , and an abundance ratio of @xmath2 ( by number ) .",
    "@xcite considered the opacity of metals ( c , n , o , si ) in addition and arrived at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , [ c]=-1.0 , [ n]=-2.0 , [ o]=-0.9 , and [ si]=-0.3 ( [ x ] : log abundance / solar abundances of species x ) .",
    "@xcite used the parameters of @xcite and investigated on the fe abundance which , as a first result , appeared to be supersolar .    in an on - going spectral analysis by means of nlte model - atmosphere techniques ( cf .",
    "rauch et al .",
    "these proceedings ) , we aim to determine abundances of individual iron - group elements and to use their ionization equilibria in order to determine the @xmath5 precisely .",
    "all strategic iron - group lines are located in the far and near ultraviolet and thus , we use fuse and hst / stis ( space telescope imaging spectrograph ) spectra for our purpose . unfortunately , the fuse wavelength region ( 904 - 1188 ) is highly contaminated by interstellar absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fuse ] ) , thus masking the photospheric information .",
    "in our analysis , we started to reproduce the stis spectrum of lsv+4621 , and the agreement is best at @xmath6 and at @xmath7 . for the abundances and a more detailed description of the analysis , see rauch et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) and @xcite .    since no ca , sc , ti , or v",
    "lines from kurucz s pos ( i.e. laboratory measured ) line list @xcite are detected in the stis spectrum , we aim to identify these in the fuse spectrum .",
    "however , this is hampered by prominent ism absorption .",
    "thus , the accurate modeling of ism absorption is a prerequisite for a reliable analysis of the photospheric fuse spectrum of lsv+4621 .",
    "we have modeled the interstellar absorption by the use of the owens program .",
    "this takes into account different radial and turbulent velocities , temperatures , chemical compositions , as well as column densities for each element included ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description ) .",
    "the comparison of our ism model spectra with the observation shows a good agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ismnomod ] ) .",
    "=    with these results we generated a normalized ism absorption spectrum which is then combined with the model - atmosphere spectrum .",
    "we are able to reproduce almost all parts of the observations and can unambiguously identify the pure photospheric absorptions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ismmod ] ) . these will be used to fine - tune the parameters of our model - atmosphere calculations .",
    "we have well modeled the ism absorption in the fuse spectrum .",
    "we find isolated photospheric lines which are suitable for a model - atmosphere analysis .",
    "however , we did not succeed in our attempt to identify lines of ca , sc , ti , or v so far .",
    "the photospheric model will be included in the ism analysis in future .",
    "this will enable us to calculate the impact on interstellar lines and to fine - tune and improve both , the ism model as well as the photospheric model .",
    "the aim will then be to extract a pure photospheric spectrum from the fuse observation .",
