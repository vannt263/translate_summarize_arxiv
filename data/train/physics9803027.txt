    "near the liquid - vapor critical point , many of the thermophysical properties of a fluid exhibit a singular behavior .",
    "for instance , the isothermal compressibility and the isobaric thermal expansion coefficients , as well as the isobaric specific heat , all diverge strongly at the critical point .",
    "critical enhancement effects are also encountered in the behavior of the thermal conductivity and the viscosity in the vicinity of the critical point , while the thermal diffusivity approaches zero .",
    "these singularities play a major role in the thermal equilibration of near - critical fluids .",
    "understanding the effect of singular fluid properties on dynamics is not always straightforward .",
    "for example , it has been shown that even though thermal diffusivity is small , temperature changes in a near - critical fluid can occur rapidly via a mechanism which causes adiabatic pressure changes in the bulk of the fluid @xcite .",
    "this adiabatic mechanism creates a strong coupling between temperature changes occurring at the fluid boundaries and the temperature response in the interior of the fluid .",
    "it works as follows .",
    "a temperature perturbation applied at the boundary of a fluid causes an expansion in the fluid near the boundary . through the medium of sound waves",
    ", this produces an adiabatic pressure change in the interior of the fluid , and a consequent change in the temperature , much more rapidly than could be accomplished by thermal diffusion acting alone . near the critical point , where the fluid becomes highly expandable and compressible , the adiabatic mechanism dominates the early thermal response and creates a ` critical speeding - up ' phenomenon .",
    "this critical speeding - up has been observed in earth - bound and low - gravity experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the short time - scale of the thermal response , experimenters have observed a much longer time - scale for the equilibration of density variations @xcite . near the critical point ,",
    "the divergence of the compressibility and the influence of gravity can create strong macroscopic density gradients ( upon which microscopic density fluctuations are superimposed ) .",
    "although early adiabatic processes act rapidly ( within seconds ) to accomplish most of the temperature changes , most of the relaxation of the density distribution to a new equilibrium state is a non - adiabatic process driven by the much slower ( hours - long ) process of heat diffusion .",
    "recently , boukari , pego , and gammon @xcite studied the combined effects of the adiabatic mechanism and earth s gravity on the equilibration process in near - critical xenon , using a system of equations which includes not only the adiabatic effect , but also one - dimensional fluid motion and heat advection . in numerical simulations of a temperature step experiment , they found that the onset of a transient diffusive regime occurs about ten times sooner than estimated by onuki , hao and ferrell @xcite in the zero - gravity case , due to the generation of a small temperature gradient by the adiabatic pressure quench in the presence of gravity .",
    "boukari et al .  also observed that over periods of many hours , no single , exponentially - decaying mode was ever observed to dominate the diffusive equilibration process .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with measurements and computations of zhong and meyer @xcite and kogan , zhong and meyer @xcite .",
    "the conclusions drawn in these works were based on results derived from one - dimensional systems of equations that do not account for multi - dimensional flows .",
    "it is not yet clear how multi - dimensional flows affect equilibration under gravity .",
    "zappoli et al .",
    "@xcite have performed computations of two - dimensional buoyant flow for a van der waals fluid fairly near the critical point ( 1k above critical ) where stratification effects are not yet very large , using an ` acoustic filtering ' technique resembling the approach taken in this paper , and have observed an unusual convection pattern . in the zero - gravity situation ,",
    "r.  f. berg @xcite has pointed out certain differences between one - dimensional and corresponding three - dimensional results regarding the late diffusive regime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to systematically derive systems of multi - dimensional equations which govern the dynamics of a low - speed , highly compressible , single - phase fluid in the presence of gravity .",
    "we shall include forces due to capillary stresses that arise from a contribution made to the energy by strong density gradients .",
    "although there are no sharp interfaces between phases in equilibrium in the one - phase regime just above the critical temperature , strong gradients can be generated as transients @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that nonlocal effects related to the energy of ` diffuse interfaces ' could play a big role in generating transient flows in certain circumstances that are accessible to experimental observation .",
    "our starting point is the general hydrodynamic equations expressing the conservation of mass , linear momentum and energy for a compressible fluid with heat conduction and gravity .",
    "we suppose that the equation of state is appropriate for conditions near the critical point , and presume that the fluid is in local equilibrium .",
    "this implies that the time - scale of interest is longer than a local relaxation time and that the critical point is not so near that the correlation length is macroscopic .",
    "these assumptions appear to be reasonable for describing the regimes studied in recent experiments .    to account for the influence of steep density gradients on energy",
    ", we adopt a constitutive structure compatible with that described in the work of j.  e. dunn and j. serrin @xcite .",
    "dunn and serrin permit the constitutive quantities ( such as the cauchy stress tensor ) to depend upon the gradient of the density as well as upon density and temperature , so that capillary effects can now be included in the equations .",
    "we account for such effects in the simplest way , adding a squared gradient term to the helmholtz free energy density .",
    "the resulting system of equations in section 2 can be used to study the influence of hydrodynamics on heat transfer on a time scale appropriate for resolving sound waves .    here , however , we are interested in relaxation and flow phenomena that occur very slowly compared to the time it takes for sound waves to cross the spatial domain .",
    "a systematic procedure for obtaining simplified equations for compressible flows on long time - scales was introduced by rehm and baum @xcite and by majda and sethian @xcite in the context of combustion theory . in section 3",
    "we apply this procedure to the system at hand .",
    "we non - dimensionalize the equations and estimate the size of the various terms , taking parameters appropriate to a typical experiment of interest . to obtain a simplified set of equations , we neglect terms which make the smallest contribution compared to the other terms .",
    "when the effect of gravity is weak , the result is a simplified model in which the leading - order pressure is spatially constant , and which accounts for multi - dimensional fluid motions influenced by the effects of thermal expansion and contraction , gravitational compression , thermal diffusion , viscosity and capillarity . with viscosity",
    "included , this simplified model consists of equations ( [ 15p])([15divw ] ) below , plus the equation of state .    when viscosity is neglected , the simplified system includes a hyperbolic equation ( for velocity ) , a parabolic equation ( for temperature ) , an elliptic equation ( related to volume expansion ) , an ordinary integro - differential equation ( for mean pressure ) , and an algebraic equation ( the equation of state ) . in a forthcoming work @xcite",
    ", we prove that the simplified model equations are evolutionary ; i.e. , we show that solutions are determined by suitable initial data .",
    "the initial data required to determine the solution consist of the temperature field , the mean pressure , and the divergence - free part of the velocity field .",
    "the density is determined from the temperature and mean pressure via the equation of state .",
    "earth s gravity creates a strongly nonlinear density profile in equilibrium when temperature is close to the critical point , due to the high compressibility .",
    "this is not well - modelled by the system ( [ 15p])([15divw ] ) . in section [ strongg ] we study how to model multidimensional flows with strong gravity .",
    "if we enforce hydrostatic balance at leading order , as was done for the one - dimensional case in @xcite , we find that generally the flow must remain strictly stratified , and any vertical fluid motions are due only to horizontally uniform density changes .    in order to admit nontrivial convective flows or gravity waves",
    ", one can assume that entropy is constant at leading order and neglect heat conduction .",
    "this corresponds to the assumptions made by ogura and phillips @xcite in deriving ` anelastic ' equations for atmospheric circulations .",
    "here we obtain anelastic equations valid for a general equation of state .",
    "the assumption of approximately constant entropy may not be compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium near the critical point , but this assumption may be relevant for describing some experiments that have been performed at near - constant entropy in order to reduce the effect of density gradients @xcite . because heat conduction is neglected , though , the anelastic equations do not contain the fast adiabatic heat - transfer mechanism mentioned above .",
    "we find a better alternative if we return to the weak - gravity scaling and make a simple modification of the momentum equation .",
    "we retain the effect of the pressure correction on density in the gravity force term , in the spirit of the boussinesq approximation . this modification does not change the formal validity of the approximation .",
    "but the new system , consisting of equations ( [ 34t])([34.v0 ] ) below , correctly captures strongly stratified thermodynamic equilibria , admits multidimensional flow including gravity waves but not acoustic waves , and includes heat conduction and the adiabatic mechanism .",
    "to start , we consider the general hydrodynamic equations expressing the conservation of mass , linear momentum , and energy for a compressible fluid with heat conduction and gravity : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the cauchy stress tensor , @xmath2 is the density , @xmath3 is the velocity , @xmath4 is the specific internal energy density , @xmath5 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 is the heat flux , and @xmath7    to account for the influence of density gradients on energy in a manner compatible with the second law of thermodynamics , we apply a theory for korteweg - type fluids described by j.  e. dunn and j. serrin @xcite .",
    "a recent review of related theories and their applications to diffuse - interface modeling has been given by anderson , mcfadden and wheeler @xcite .",
    "dunn and serrin replace the energy balance equation with @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents a contribution made to the power by capillary effects due to the strong density gradients .",
    "they then postulate that @xmath10 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath11 , as well as @xmath12 , the specific helmholtz free energy density , and @xmath13 , the specific entropy density , are given by constitutive relations that depend only on the pointwise values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where @xmath15 is the temperature .    in order to guarantee that the equations of motion are compatible with the second law of thermodynamics as expressed by the clausius - duhem inequality ,",
    "dunn and serrin deduce that the constitutive relations must be such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , in the case without viscosity , the stress must take the form @xmath24 in ( [ 12u ] ) , the quantity @xmath25 measures the `` static '' part of the capillary work flux @xmath11 . for a class of materials including those we shall consider , @xmath26 , so @xmath27 has no effect on the energy balance equation and can be ignored .",
    "we choose the simplest possible form for the specific helmholtz free energy density @xmath12 that is consistent with dunn and serrin s theory .",
    "namely , we suppose that @xmath28 is constant , and that @xmath29 this yields an expression for total free energy that appears in van der waals theory of capillarity @xcite , for example . from ( [ 12ds1 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the heat flux is given by @xmath32 @xmath33 , with thermal conductivity coefficient @xmath34 .",
    "and we suppose that the stress is given by ( [ 12t1 ] ) with the addition of newtonian viscosity terms , so that @xmath35 where the pressure @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 @xmath38 is the symmetric part of @xmath39 , and the viscosity coefficients have the form @xmath40 , @xmath41 . for compatibility with the clausius - duhem inequality @xcite ,",

    ", observations were performed using light scattering through a fluid layer 100 microns thick @xcite .",
    "we should also comment on the effect of proximity to the critical temperature . as @xmath65 approaches zero",
    ", we have seen that the capillary coefficient diverges very weakly , with exponent @xmath108 .",
    "the viscosity and the sound speed also diverge at a very slow rate , changing only modestly over the experimental range of interest .",
    "the specific heat @xmath109 also diverges weakly , with exponent @xmath110 .",
    "the compressibility , thermal expansivity and specific heat @xmath111 diverge strongly , all with exponent @xmath112 .",
    "the thermal conductivity diverges less strongly , like @xmath113 @xcite , with approximately the exponent @xmath114 .",
    "so we see that as @xmath65 approaches zero , none of the nondimensional constants above has a very strong dependence on @xmath65 , though we can expect the nondimensional diffusivity @xmath71 and @xmath74 to decrease .      to obtain simplified equations for compressible flows , we proceed formally in a manner motivated by the treatments of rehm and baum @xcite and majda and sethian @xcite . since we are interested in longer time scales , we regard @xmath70 and @xmath74 as small and let @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 denote assumed asymptotic limits of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 respectively , as @xmath70 and @xmath74 are taken to zero . in this process",
    "we regard @xmath101 as fixed and of order one , corresponding to a low - gravity environment for our flow regime . multiplying the momentum equation ( [ 13.1v ] ) by @xmath70 and taking @xmath70 to 0 , we require @xmath121 and therefore @xmath122 is constant in space . from ( [ 13.1t])([13.1p ] ) , the asymptotic equations for temperature and pressure are @xmath123 here the asymptotic density @xmath124 from the equation of state , and elsewhere the subscript 0 indicates a nondimensional coefficient that is evaluated at @xmath125 , e.g. , @xmath126 .",

    "in the flow regime for xenon that we have described , such time scales are short , since the sound speed is of the order of tens of meters per second .",

    "motivating us is the problem of describing near - critical fluid flows and equilibration in earth s gravity .",
    "recall that @xmath193 in the flow regime considered in section [ flowregime ] with earth s gravity .",
    "the simplified system ( [ 15p])([15divw ] ) fails to capture some key features of equilibration in this situation .    in equilibrium , temperature is constant and density is stratified according to the basic equation of hydrostatic balance , @xmath194 and the equation of state .",

    "thus the density gradient develops a singularity at the level of critical density , and the density profile becomes highly nonlinear . in fig .  1 we plot density profiles for xenon in equilibrium at 1 g , using the restricted cubic equation of state as in @xcite .      for the simplified system ( [ 15p])([15divw ] ) , however , the density in equilibrium is constant , given by @xmath200 .",

    "but as it stands , the system ( [ 15p])([15divw ] ) relies only on the leading - order density to determine the fluid flow .",
    "one can therefore expect this system to be inaccurate in modeling phenomena such as deep convection and gravity waves in near - equilibrium states .    in order to model related phenomena ,",
    "researchers studying small - scale atmospheric circulations frequently approximate the continuity equation with the ` anelastic ' continuity equation @xmath204 where @xmath205 is usually defined either as the density in an adiabatically stratified , horizontally uniform reference state , or as the horizontally - averaged actual density .",

    "some of the largest errors in the ogura - phillips anelastic approximation are reported to be generated by large deviations of the mean state potential temperature ( or entropy ) from a constant reference value .",
    "several authors ( dutton and fichtl @xcite , wilhelmson and ogura @xcite , lipps and hemler @xcite , durran @xcite ) have presented alternative ` sound - proof ' equations in which thermodynamic variables associated with the adiabatic reference state are replaced with horizontally - uniform averaged or approximate actual values .",
    "these authors make different approximations in the momentum equations , but ( except for durran ) they all obtain a continuity equation of the form ( [ eqn1 ] ) in which @xmath209 is defined as a horizontally - averaged approximation to the actual density .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we describe three possible models for multi - dimensional flows under strong gravity , making different assumptions about how to balance and approximate terms in the nondimensionalized system ( [ 13.1v])([13.1p ] ) :    * at first we scale so as to enforce hydrostatic balance at leading order .",
    "we find then that to be consistent , at leading order the thermodynamic variables must remain horizontally uniform .",
    "also the vertical velocity must remain horizontally uniform , _ unless _ we assume the entropy is spatially _ constant _ to leading order . *",
    "if we indeed assume that entropy is spatially constant to leading order and also neglect heat conduction , we obtain a generalization of the anelastic approximation valid for a general equation of state .",
    "* neither choice so far admits both thermodynamic equilibrium states and non - stratified multidimensional flows .",
    "we find , however , that if we return to the scaling adopted in section [ flowregime ] , and modify the momentum equation so that the gravity force term incorporates a pressure correction self - consistently , then we get a system of the same formal accuracy that admits physically correct equilibrium states exactly .",
    "moreover the new system supports gravity waves but not acoustic waves .",

    "we must neglect heat conduction to maintain entropy constant ; this restricts the time scale , and any flows generated will be adiabatic .",
    "to describe flows , we use the notation of section [ flowregime ] for nondimensional and leading - order quantities , and nondimensionalize entropy according to @xmath217 where @xmath218 ( as discussed below ) .",

    "it seems that in our flow regime , the entropy gradient may not be small enough for the anelastic approximation to be reasonable for states near true equilibrium ( at least at the level of critical density ) .",
    "but states near constant entropy do possess experimental interest .",
    "physically , the condition that an inviscid stratified fluid is stable against convection is @xmath265 @xcite . in order to obtain ` pseudo - equilibrium ' states with near - uniform density profiles , ground - based experiments have been suggested on near - critical fluids in which a steady - state heat flux is maintained so as to achieve a marginally stable entropy profile @xcite , also see @xcite . note that the adiabatic density gradient satisfies @xmath266 , which is about 1/500 m@xmath100 in our flow regime , so the density is close to constant in centimeter - sized cells .",

    "it filters acoustic waves but admits gravity waves , as we shall show in the subsection to follow .",
    "moreover , heat conduction need not be neglected , so the adiabatic effect can be modeled .",
    "it should be interesting to study what flows are generated when large density changes in the thermal boundary layer are present together with very stable equilibrium entropy profiles away from the boundary .",
    "we remark that it is evidently not necessary to replace @xmath283 by @xmath279 in the acceleration term of ( [ 14v ] ) to gain true equilibria as rest states .",
    "in some circumstances it may be more convenient not to make this replacement .",
    "but it turns out that equation ( [ 34.v0 ] ) is slightly more convenient when we study the linearized equations for gravity waves ; see the next section .",

    "the system can be expected to lose formal validity if solutions become large or singular , as may well happen in a nonadiabatic convection process .",
    "another point is that while the leading - order total energy is conserved in time for the weak - gravity equations ( [ 15p])([15divw ] ) , this is not strictly true for the system ( [ 34t])([34.v0 ] ) .",
    "the time derivative of the leading - order total energy is formally of order @xmath70 instead .",
    "we wish to verify that in the linear approximation near a stably stratified rest state for which entropy decreases with height , the system ( [ 34t])([34.v0 ] ) admits gravity waves but not acoustic waves when heat conduction and viscosity are neglected .",
    "we shall also show that , in the special case of a perfect gas with an exponential density profile and constant sound speed , in the limit of large wave number the gravity - wave frequency approaches the brunt - visl  frequency @xmath285 corresponding to a compressible fluid .",
    "this frequency satisfies @xmath286 the second term does not appear in the usual treatment of gravity waves for a stratified incompressible fluid , in which the density is advected with the flow , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when heat conduction and viscosity are neglected in the system ( [ 34t])([34.v0 ] ) , the leading - order pressure is constant in time as well as space .",
    "consequently the temperature ( and entropy ) are advected with the flow , and the velocity field has zero divergence . in dimensional form with @xmath287 and @xmath288 , the governing equations take the form @xmath289 near a rest state where @xmath290 , we write @xmath291 and @xmath292",
    ". then we linearize , obtaining @xmath293 where the coefficients are evaluated at @xmath294 .",

    "we look for normal modes with @xmath296 and eliminate @xmath297 , @xmath298 and the horizontal components of velocity from the system .",
    "note that the sound speed satisfies @xmath299 , and define @xmath300 ( the last identity holds due to hydrostatic balance . ) then for the vertical velocity component @xmath301 we obtain the equation @xmath302 where @xmath303 .",
    "the vertical velocity must vanish at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "so , given a horizontal wave number @xmath304 , possible oscillation frequencies @xmath305 are determined by solving the eigenvalue problem in ( [ 35wbar ] ) with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we note that in the special case of perfect gas at constant temperature , the density profile is exponential and sound speed is constant , and so @xmath306 and @xmath307 are constant .",
    "then ( [ 35wbar ] ) has explicit solutions of the form @xmath308 , whence the gravity - wave dispersion relation is given by @xmath309 in the limit @xmath310 , this expression approaches @xmath311 , where @xmath285 from ( [ 35bv ] ) is the brunt - visl  frequency for a compressible fluid . for comparison , for a fully compressible fluid",
    "in which one starts with @xmath312 in place of ( [ 35div ] ) , the dispersion relation in this special case is @xmath313 for large @xmath314 , the plus sign yields @xmath315 , corresponding to acoustic waves , and the minus sign yields @xmath316 , corresponding to gravity waves .",
    "the magnitude of any oscillation frequency @xmath305 that satisfies ( [ 35disp1 ] ) is less than @xmath285 , showing that the system ( [ 35s])([35v ] ) supports gravity waves but not acoustic waves .",
    "in general , when the coefficients in ( [ 35wbar ] ) vary with @xmath203 , we can obtain an upper bound on oscillation frequencies as follows .",
    "let @xmath317 , multiply equation ( [ 35wbar ] ) by @xmath318 and integrate over @xmath319 $ ] , from bottom to top .",
    "one obtains @xmath320 since the second integrand can not be everywhere nonnegative , it follows that @xmath321    the dispersion relation in ( [ 35disp1 ] ) is very similar to that obtained in the usual case of an incompressible fluid when one assumes the density is advected with the flow .",
    "starting from the governing equations @xmath322 one finds in similar fashion that the equation corresponding to ( [ 35wbar ] ) is @xmath323 and for an exponential density profile the dispersion relation is @xmath324 in the limit @xmath310 this approaches @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is the _ usual _ brunt - visl  frequency for an incompressible fluid . in many circumstances",
    "the difference between @xmath326 and @xmath285 may be negligible , but it is interesting that the dispersion relation arising from the system ( [ 35s])([35v ] ) more faithfully approximates the compressible case in this respect .",
    "we close with a few remarks intended to clarify the differences between the new system ( [ 34t])([34.v0 ] ) and the anelastic system ( [ 33.rho1])([33.rho0 ] ) . for purposes of comparison , we neglect heat conduction . in this case",

    "the source of the constraint on velocity ( ( [ 36div ] ) or ( [ 33.rho0 ] ) respectively ) is the continuity equation @xmath329 where @xmath330 . for the anelastic system ,",
    "the leading order entropy @xmath219 is constant and the pressure @xmath115 is a function of @xmath203 determined by the hydrostatic balance equation ( [ 32.hydro ] ) , so @xmath331 . using hydrostatic balance we can also write ( [ 33.rho0 ] ) in the form essentially given by batchelor @xcite : @xmath332    for the new system ( [ 36s])([36v0 ] ) , since @xmath115 is a constant when heat conduction is neglected , we have @xmath333 and this is why the velocity field is divergence - free .",
    "note that if we seek to ` improve ' equation ( [ 36cont0 ] ) by replacing @xmath283 by @xmath328 , then we recover the original fully compressible system without simplification !",
    "indeed , the essential difference between the fully compressible system ( [ 13.1v])([13.1p ] ) ( neglecting heat conduction and viscous power terms ) , and system ( [ 36s])([36v0 ] ) with @xmath334 , is precisely that in the new system a term proportional to @xmath335 is neglected in the continuity equation .",
