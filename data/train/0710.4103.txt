    "quantum chromodynamics ( or qcd ) is the underlying theory of the strong interaction ( one of the four fundamental interactions in nature besides gravity , electromagnetism and the weak interaction ) .",
    "it is the force that binds quarks and gluons as the nucleus in the heart of the atom .",
    "since all matter in the universe is built that way , unraveling the structure of matter at its deepest level as governed by qcd is key to our understanding of the physical world , and presents one of the most challenging tasks in contemporary nuclear and particle physics .",
    "while it is easy to write down the basic equation of qcd , it is very difficult to obtain quantitative solutions in view of the complex quark - gluon dynamics . at present , the only known way to solve qcd directly is by numerically evaluating the path integrals in the theory on a discrete space - time lattice using supercomputers",
    ". for textbooks on the subject , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "all physics can be computed by path integrals in qcd .",
    "take the calculation of the proton mass for example .",
    "it requires the fully - interacting quark propagator defined by the euclidean - space path integrals over gluon field @xmath0 and quarks fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 the action is the sum of a gluon part and a quark part @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] is the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath6 is the dirac operator for quarks and @xmath7 the 4x4 gamma matrices .",
    "the interaction between the two is provided by the covariant derivative @xmath8 .",
    "the basic parameters of the theory are the coupling constant @xmath9 and quark mass @xmath10 .",
    "the quark part of the integration can be done analytically using grassmann variable integration , leading to a path integral over only gluon fields @xmath11 which is evaluated numerically by monte - carlo methods . in the quenched approximation ,",
    "the quark determinant @xmath12 is ignored ( equivalent to suppressing vacuum polarization ) , making the numerical calculation significantly faster .    to compute the proton mass ,",
    "one considers the time - ordered , two - point correlation function in the qcd vacuum , projected to zero momentum : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is called the interpolating field which is built from quark fields with the quantum numbers of the proton ( spin-1/2 , isospin-1/2 , quark content uud , charge + e ) @xmath15u^c(x)\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the charge conjugation operator and the superscript @xmath17 means transpose .",
    "sum over color indeces a , b , c is implied and the @xmath18 ensures the proton is color - singlet .    the calculation of @xmath19 at the quark level proceeds by contracting out all the quark pairs , resulting in @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the fully - interacting quark propagator @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ qprop ] ) .    on the hadronic level , the correlation function",
    "is saturated by the complete spectrum of intermediate states ( after a parity projection ) with the proton as the ground state : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the masses and @xmath25 are the amplitudes which are a measure of the ability of the interpolating field to excite or annhilate the states from the qcd vacuum . at large time , the ground state proton , @xmath26 , dominates @xmath19 , with the excited states exponentially suppressed .",
    "other physics quantities are computed in a similar way .",
    "it is impossible to give a full account of the achievements made in lattice qcd in the space given here .",
    "a good place to gauge the progress in the field ( which is not limited to qcd ) is the annual gathering  @xcite by active practitioners . here",

    "[ cppacs ] shows that the computed light hadron mass spectrum which comes within 10% of the observed spectrum .",
