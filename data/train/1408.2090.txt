    "top quark with its large mass and very short life time is one of the most interesting discovered particles in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "studying top quark enables us to investigate the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism ( ewsb ) as well as searching for extensions of the sm . in the framework of the sm ,",
    "top - quark flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) only arise at loop level and highly suppressed because of the gim ( glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "for example , the sm predictions for the branching fractions of fcnc processes like @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of the order of 10@xmath20 and 10@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the ability of the present experiments is far from measuring such tiny branching ratios .",
    "on the other hand , several extensions of the sm such as technicolor , susy models , higgs doublet models predict much higher branching ratios up to @xmath22 order of magnitude larger than sm values @xcite .",
    "consequently , any observation of these rare fcnc transitions would be a clear signal of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "recently , both cms and atlas experiments have looked for fcnc transitions of the top quark to @xmath23 , gluon , z and higgs bosons through different channels  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent observed upper limits at @xmath5 confidence level ( cl ) have been found to be @xcite : @xmath24 the limit on the @xmath25 has been set using the combination of lhc data at 7 and 8 tev while the bounds on @xmath26 are based on only 8 tev data .",
    "it is notable to mention here that even at the future upgrades of the lhc , these bounds would not be improved considerably .",
    "for example , the future upper bounds on @xmath27 have been predicted to be @xmath28 at @xmath5 cl at 14 tev center - of - mass energy with 3000 fb@xmath6 of integrated luminosity of data @xcite .",
    "therefore , an important task is to look at the future colliders potential to search for the anomalous fcnc couplings , in particular the @xmath29 colliders such as ilc , clic and the future circular collider ( fcc ) @xcite in @xcite , an analysis has been performed to probe the sensitivity of a future @xmath2 collider to top fcnc to the photon and a z boson in the @xmath30 channel .",
    "this analysis has been done at the center - of - mass energies of 500 gev and 800 gev with the integrated luminosity of up to 1000 fb@xmath6 without including parton showering , hadronization , and decay of unstable particles",
    ". however , the analysis considers cases with no beam polarization , with polarization of electron and with the case of polarization of electron and positron .",
    "then the sensitivity to @xmath0 and @xmath1 fcnc couplings have been estimated .",
    "the future large scale circular electron - positron collider ( fcc - ee ) would be one of the high - precision and high - luminosity machines which will be able to perform precise measurements on the higgs boson , top - quark , @xmath9 and @xmath31 bosons  @xcite .",
    "due to the expected large amount of data and large production rates , fcc - ee can provide an excellent opportunity for precise studies , in particular in the top quark sector .",
    "fcc - ee is designed to be working at the center - of - mass energy up to the @xmath32 threshold mass , i.e. @xmath33 gev which is upgradeable to 500 gev .",
    "the goal is to reach to a luminosity of @xmath34 @xmath35s@xmath6  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study the anomalous fcnc of @xmath0 and @xmath1 via single top quark production in the fcc - ee at three different center - of - mass energies of 240 gev,350 gev and 500 gev .",
    "the final state consists of a top quark in association with a light - quark .",
    "we consider the leptonic decay of the @xmath31 boson in top quark decay , @xmath36 . in the analysis",
    ", we perform parton shower , hadronization and decays of unstable particles as well as a raw detector simulation .",
    "we present the @xmath4 discovery ranges and upper limits on the branching ratios at @xmath5 c.l in terms of the integrated luminosity .",
    "finally , the results are compared with the present and future results from the lhc experiments    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ theoretical - formalism ] we present the theoretical framework which describes the top quark fcnc couplings to a photon and @xmath9 boson . the monte carlo event generation ,",
    "detector simulation and signal separation from backgrounds are described in section  [ monte - carlo ] . in section",
    "[ results ] , the results of the sensitivity estimation are presented .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "the anomalous fcnc couplings of a top quark with a photon and @xmath9 boson can be written in a model independent way using an effective lagrangian approach .",

    "the complex chirality parameters are normalized to @xmath41 = @xmath42 = @xmath43 = 1 and @xmath44 are the left- and right - handed projection operators , @xmath45 .",
    "it is notable that the term which contains @xmath46 is dimension four and the terms with @xmath47 are dimension five .",
    "the anomalous fcnc interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 lead to production of a top quark in association with a light quark in electron - positron collisions . the feynman diagram for this process is shown in figure [ feynman - diagram ] including the subsequent leptonic decay of the w boson in top quark decay . in table",
    "[ cross - sections1 ] , the cross sections of @xmath48 including the branching ratio of top quark decays into a @xmath31 boson and a b - quark with @xmath31 boson decays into a charged lepton ( muon and electron ) and neutrino are presented .",
    "the cross sections are shown at three different center - of - mass energies of 240 , 350 and 500 gev .",
    "it should be pointed out that the cross sections due to photon and @xmath9 boson exchange are different and depends on the type of coupling . the contribution of photon exchange and @xmath9 boson with @xmath47 coupling increases with the energy of the center - of - mass .",
    "this is because of the presence of an additional momentum factor @xmath49 in the effective lagrangian .    according to the three independent terms of the lagrangian",
    ", there are three separate ways to produce single top quark plus a light quark . in this analysis",
    ", all three terms of the lagrangian are investigated independently with the following sets of the parameters : @xmath50 for @xmath0 , for vector like coupling of @xmath1 : @xmath51 while for tensor fcnc coupling of @xmath1 : @xmath52 . in case of observing an excess indicating fcnc signal ,",

    "it is worth mentioning that the fcnc transitions can also be probed in @xmath63 production when a top quark decays anomalously into @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "however , it has been found that the limits would be looser than the ones obtained in single top productions @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that although the limits obtained in this study are expected to be more stringent than the lhc future however in case of observing the signal , in contrary to fcc - ee , lhc is able to discriminate between anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in case of signal observation , lhc would also be able to discriminate between anomalous @xmath66 and @xmath67 using for example the charge ratio technique @xcite .",
    "this also would be possible at the fcc - ee in case of having detectors with good efficiency of charm tagging .",
    "versus @xmath68 at @xmath5 c.l from the recent analyses of the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "the expected sensitivity from the atlas experiment with 300 fb@xmath6 is also shown by the dashed lines .",

    "top quark flavor - changing neutral current interactions are extremely forbidden in the sm framework because of the gim ( glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ) mechanisms .",
    "the sm predictions for branching ratios of the top quark decay into a photon or a @xmath9 boson and an up - type quark are at the order of @xmath69 .",
    "however , several extensions of the sm can enhance the branching ratios by a factor of @xmath70 depending on the model .",
    "therefore , precise measurement of these branching ratios provide an excellent possibility to probe the extensions of sm in the top quark sector .",
    "while it is impossible to measure the branching ratios with the precisions of order of @xmath69 to test the sm , observation of sizeable branching ratios would indicate new physics beyind the sm .",

    "we perform the analysis in a model independent way using the effective lagrangian approach at the center - of - mass energies of @xmath72 = 240 , 350 and 500 gev . in the analysis",
    ", we only consider the leptonic ( electron and muon ) decay of the @xmath31 boson in the top quark decay . in the analysis , parton shower , hadronization and decay of unstable particles are performed using pythia   and jets are reconstructed using the anti@xmath73 algorithm available in the fastjet   package .",

    "we find that with increasing the center - of - mass energy stronger bounds would be reachable . with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath6 at the center - of - mass energy of 350 gev , upper limits of @xmath75 , @xmath76 would be obtained on @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79type ) , respectively",
