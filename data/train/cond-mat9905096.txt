    "division of configuration space into the basins of attraction surrounding the minima is less useful in this dynamical regime .      to model",

    "the anharmonic correction for each minimum was derived from the heights of the barriers connected to it .",
    "the resulting partition function for this `` morse barrier '' ( mb ) method is @xmath84 in this expression , @xmath85 is the number of transition states connected to minimum @xmath5 , and @xmath86 is the anharmonicity parameter derived from the barrier height , @xmath87 , of the @xmath10th transition state connected to minimum @xmath5 .",

    "anharmonic corrections were applied only to low - energy minima , which tend not to have small barriers .",
    "this prescription is not entirely satisfactory because the low barriers of high - energy minima are a signature of the strong anharmonicity in these states , which is then ignored by this method .",
    "furthermore , some criterion for selecting minima for anharmonic corrections is required .",

    "the global minimum equilibrium probabilities of the m@xmath0 clusters with @xmath78 and 6 using the mb and mb@xmath91 formulations are shown by the dotted and dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : pftest]a and [ fig : pftest]b .",
    "the inadequacy of the unconstrained mb model is obvious ; the large anharmonic corrections of the high - energy minima cause these states to dominate as soon as they become energetically accessible , making the probability of the global minimum plummet at an artificially low temperature . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the mb@xmath91 model produces a marginally better match to the mc data at low temperature than the harmonic approximation , but then deviates more rapidly . for @xmath68 ,",
    "quite a reasonable improvement is achieved .",
    "however , the position of the curve is continuously adjustable from the mb method ( effectively @xmath98 ) to the harmonic approximation ( @xmath99 ) , so it is difficult to argue that the improvement is based on physical insight .",
    "the effect of the partition function model on the equilibrium probabilities of minima other than the global minimum is hard to gauge for a system where there are so many of them , since the quench statistics are poor .",

    "the mb@xmath105 method , however , represents only a marginal improvement on the harmonic approximation .",
    "we have also found this to be the case for the lj@xmath106 cluster studied by ball and berry@xcite , using the model that gave the greatest improvement for the equilibrium probabilities of the various isomers .",
    "this result shows that optimizing the models for the probabilities does not necessarily produce the correct thermodynamic behaviour .",
    "doye and wales found that , whilst first order anharmonic corrections were enough to improve the thermodynamic description of lj@xmath107 in the superposition method , second order corrections were necessary for the smaller lj@xmath0@xcite .",
    "attempts to model the density of states of individual minima using an analytic function of the energy implicitly assume that the `` shape '' of the basin of attraction is simple enough to be described adequately by such a form . in practice ,",
    "basins of attraction are probably highly complex objects . for example , in previous work@xcite we saw that increasing the range of the potential removes locally stable minima , but remnants of these features are likely to persist as shoulders or inflections on the pes , so that regions of configuration space that were associated with shallow minima for a shorter - ranged potential become formally associated with other minima when the range is increased .",
    "these features might explain why the model partition function results in fig .  [ fig : pftest ] are worse for @xmath78 than for @xmath68 .",
    "to illustrate this effect , we have performed microcanonical md simulations of m@xmath0 with @xmath78 , and lj@xmath0 , which closely resembles m@xmath0 with @xmath68 .",
    "periodic quenching was applied , and the euclidean distance , @xmath108 , was calculated between the configuration point taken at the start of the quench and the local minimum to which it converged .",
    "the distribution of @xmath108 for the subset of quenches that led to the global minimum is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : quenchdist ] at two energies for each cluster . in each case",
    ", the lower energy has been chosen just above that at which the trajectory can escape from the global minimum , so that over 95% of quenches return to the global minimum , and the cluster is exploring a large proportion of the catchment basin of this structure .",
    "the higher energy was chosen such that about half the quenches return to the global minimum .",
    "the corresponding distributions are broader and peak at a higher value of @xmath108 , as would be expected .",
    "the shaded region on each graph shows the distribution of @xmath108 for the minima directly connected to the global minimum .",
    "each of these minima is surrounded by its own basin of attraction , and a barrier must be surmounted before the configuration point enters the catchment basin of the global minimum .",
    "even so , in fig .",
    "[ fig : quenchdist]b for lj@xmath0 , the tail of the high - energy quench distribution overlaps somewhat with the distribution of connected minima , indicating that some of the points in the basin of attraction of the global minimum are as far from it as the closest local minima . in fig .",
    "[ fig : quenchdist]a for m@xmath0 with @xmath78 , however , the high - energy quench distribution overlaps completely with the distribution of connected minima .",
    "the overlap means that many configurations which differ structurally from the global minimum as much as the connected local minima still quench to the global minimum .",
    "such configurations may include structures which for a slightly shorter - ranged potential fall into the catchment basin of a different local minimum .     +    further evidence to support this explanation comes from fig .",
    "[ fig : pftest ] .",
    "the mc results for @xmath68 show that the increase in gradient of the caloric curve  indicative of the system sampling a new region of configuration space  occurs at the temperature where the trajectory begins to escape from the global minimum , as shown by the decrease in @xmath109 .",
    "the transition is therefore out of the basin of attraction of the global minimum , effectively from solid - like to liquid - like states .",
    "the analogous results for @xmath78 show that the transition feature in the caloric curve starts before the probability of the global minimum drops significantly .",
    "this behaviour is suggestive of a weak transition from configurations close to the global minimum to higher - energy ones , all taking place within the basin of attraction of the global minimum itself .",
    "the picture of the basin of attraction around the global minimum that emerges is therefore complex .",
    "it extends far into configuration space from the icosahedron , and past the catchment basins of local minima in certain directions .",
    "the structural dissimilarity of some points which are formally associated with the global minimum suggests that quenching might not be the most meaningful way of dividing configuration space amongst the various minima . from this point of view , the underestimation of the global minimum probability in fig .",
    "[ fig : pftest]a by the harmonic superposition method is somewhat misleading , since it is not helpful to think of the distant configurations as belonging to the icosahedral well .",
    "the harmonic approximation may therefore give a more meaningful probability that the cluster has a structure resembling the global minimum than quenching .",
    "2    in summary , although the harmonic approximation has only partial success in describing the equilibrium properties of the clusters examined here , it is attractive in its simplicity , lack of empirical parameters , and clear physical basis .",
    "more complicated analytic models do not necessarily provide greater insight , or even systematically improved results .",
    "we therefore adopt the harmonic approximation for the rate constant and equilibrium property expressions in sec .",
    "[ sect : rateseqm ] , with the proviso that they will only be applied at low and moderate temperatures , where the description should be adequate for our purposes .",
    "the resulting microcanonical rate constants , via eq .",
    "( [ eq : rrkm ] ) , are given by @xmath110 and the canonical expression from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tst ] ) is @xmath111 finally , we note that the harmonic superposition method is likely to be more successful in the canonical ensemble than the microcanonical because at constant temperature the velocity distribution is independent of the configuration point .",
    "in contrast , at fixed total energy the kinetic energy is significantly further `` above '' the pes when the configuration point is near a deep potential well than when it is near higher - lying ones .",
    "we now turn to the effect of the range of the potential on the dynamics of the m@xmath0 clusters in the light of our previous analysis of the energy landscapes@xcite .",
    "the larger number of rearrangements and smaller energy gradient on paths to the global minimum , as well as the higher downhill barriers , are expected to impede relaxation to the global minimum as the range of the potential is decreased .",
    "figure [ fig : layers ] illustrates the range dependence of structural relaxation to the global minimum .",
    "the minima are grouped into `` layers '' according to the smallest number of rearrangements required to reach the global minimum .",
    "layer 1 contains only the global minimum , and level @xmath112 contains all minima directly connected to a minimum in level @xmath5 , but not to any minimum in a layer lower than @xmath5 .",
    "the initial probability vector at each value of @xmath63 is a uniform distribution amongst the minima in the furthest layer from the global minimum .",
    "the energy has been chosen such that the equilibrium probability of the global minimum is @xmath113 , and the solution of the master equation is shown until the time at which 80% of this population ( i.e. , @xmath114 ) has been achieved .",
    "the most striking trend is the increasing time scale as the potential range decreases , as predicted by the landscape analysis@xcite .",
    "the @xmath115 cluster takes over three orders of magnitude longer to reach 80% of equilibrium than the @xmath78 cluster .",
    "note that for the latter system , the time scale plotted is only of the order of a few vibrational periods@xcite . in the light of previous work@xcite",
    "the application of the master equation to the @xmath78 cluster is therefore probably at the limit of validity , since the assumption of stochastic transitions breaks down when the relaxation time approaches the vibrational period .",
    "the relaxation is straightforward for @xmath78 ; the furthest layer decays whilst the populations of the global minimum and the intermediate layer grow monotonically . at @xmath68",
    "we see the accumulation and decay of a transient population in layer 3 as the outward flow from these minima does not match the rapid initial input from the furthest layer .",
    "the layer 3 minima therefore constitute a kinetic bottleneck for relaxation down the funnel of the pes .",
    "more complex behaviour arises for @xmath116 and 14 , where there are six layers of minima .",
    "the probabilities experience an initial jump as the system is released from its strongly non - equilibrium state , and then relax slowly to their final values .",
    "layer 5 at @xmath115 ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : layers ] ) shows particularly complicated behaviour , rising suddenly at first , decaying slightly , and then rising again before relaxing monotonically .",
    "this oscillation occurs because layer 4 develops a transient population , blocking further downward output from layer 5 while layer 6 is still releasing probability into layer 5 from above .      by analogy with the `` folding time '' in the protein folding literature , we can examine the ability of the cluster to find its global minimum by defining a `` search time '' as the time taken for the probability of the global minimum to reach a particular value after the system is released from a non - equilibrium state .",
    "here we use a probability threshold of @xmath113 , but we will discuss the effects of changing this choice .    fig .  [",
    "fig : foldingtime ] shows the search time for m@xmath0 as a function of temperature using four values of @xmath63 .",
    "the initial probability vector was a uniform distribution amongst the minima in the layer furthest from the global minimum .",
    "the qualitative shape of the curves is easily understood .",
    "as the temperature is increased from low values , the search time decreases because the thermal energy rises above the barriers between the minima .",
    "an optimal temperature , @xmath117 is reached , where the search time is a minimum , @xmath118 , above which it rises because the thermodynamic driving force towards the global minimum is reduced at higher temperatures .",
    "ultimately , the equilibrium probability of the global minimum falls below the threshold of @xmath113 , and the search time is no longer defined .",
    "similar behaviour has been observed for the same reasons in direct simulations of kcl clusters@xcite and lattice protein models@xcite , as well as a master equation study of idealized energy landscapes@xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath118 increases with @xmath63 , as expected from the relaxation profiles of the previous section , and this slowing down is accompanied by a decrease in the temperature width @xmath122 . as the range of the potential",

    "this observation explains why @xmath120 falls as @xmath63 increases . for high @xmath63 ,",
    "the downhill barriers between minima are on average larger , so that as the temperature is decreased , isomerisation processes slow down more dramatically than for small @xmath63 .",

    "only very slight curvature is visible in the @xmath125 results .",
    "fitting to the form @xmath126 gives the pre - exponential factors and activation energies for the forward and reverse processes : @xmath127    interestingly , the effective activation energy for @xmath128 is close to the overall barrier on the lowest - energy path between the funnels , starting from the global minimum@xcite , which is @xmath129 .",
    "this result suggests that the pathways passing over the highest - energy transition state on the lowest - energy pathway determine the interfunnel dynamics .",
    "@xmath130 for @xmath131 , however , is significantly lower than the overall potential barrier for the reverse process , which is @xmath132 , starting from the lowest - energy icosahedral minimum .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that more than one minimum in the icosahedral funnel is substantially occupied .",
    "hence , the effective barrier from the icosahedral funnel should not be measured from the lowest - energy minimum in the icosahedral funnel , but with respect to a weighted average of the minimum energies , @xmath133 .",
    "the slight curvature in the arrhenius plot for @xmath125 is a result of the temperature dependence of this average .",
    "an alternative method for computing the rates for interfunnel conversion would be to calculate first the free energy barrier between the two funnels , and then the transmission coefficient for passage over this barrier@xcite .",
    "the free energy barriers have been calculated for lj@xmath1 and were found to decrease as the temperature is increased towards that required for melting .",
    "therefore , if this method is also to show an arrhenius behaviour , the temperature dependence of the transmission coefficient must compensate that of the free energy barriers .",
    "we have seen that the interfunnel rates drop dramatically as the temperature is lowered . at the same time , the increasing net flow indices show that the corresponding relaxation modes become more distinct from other processes .",
    "these features concur with stillinger s interpretation of @xmath134 processes in fragile liquids@xcite . in this picture ,",
    "@xmath135 processes are faster and more localized in configuration space , whereas the @xmath134 processes , which become relatively slow at low temperatures , are thought to occur between `` craters '' ( a similar concept to funnels ) on the energy landscape .",
    "these differences give rise to a bifurcation of time scales , which is visible for lj@xmath1 in the eigenvalue spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : evspeclj38 ] .",
    "however , @xmath134 processes have been observed to have a non - arrhenius temperature dependence , in contrast with the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] .",
    "the arrhenius behaviour may be a genuine feature of the dynamics of the lj@xmath1 cluster , but could also be a limitation of the present approach .",
    "in particular , our incomplete database contains only a limited number of pathways between the two funnels , and competition between such paths would give rise to non - arrhenius behaviour .",
    "we can study only a limited temperature range with our database , and the modelling of individual processes might not be sufficiently sophisticated .",
    "we note that angelani et al .  also observed unexpected arrhenius behaviour in their master equation study of a fragile glass former@xcite .",
    "the progress of the probability vector towards equilibrium can be visualized using equilibration graphs@xcite .",
    "such a graph has a time axis , on which lines denote a group of states in local equilibrium with each other .",
    "nodes join lines at the time that the corresponding groups first come into equilibrium , until there is just one group and the whole system has equilibrated .",
    "we define the time that minima @xmath5 and @xmath10 come into equilibrium as the smallest value of @xmath6 after which @xmath136 is always satisfied , and in the present work we set @xmath137 .",
    "figure [ fig : eqtrees ] shows equilibration graphs for the six minima in each of the two funnels of lj@xmath1 that have the greatest equilibrium probability at @xmath138 .",
    "they are numbered in order of increasing probability within each funnel .",
    "the initial vertical position of each minimum is taken as the integrated path length , @xmath139 , along the shortest path to the global minimum , making the two groups clearly distinguishable on this axis .",
    "three microcanonical energies are plotted , spanning the range of applicability of our database .",
    "the sample was pruned using an equilibrium threshold of @xmath140 at each energy .",
    "the evolution of two initial probability vectors was considered : in the left - hand graphs , the initial probability of the global minimum is unity , and in the right - hand graphs the probability commences in the lowest - energy icosahedral minimum .    in each of the six graphs ,",
    "the minima within a funnel come into equilibrium with each other before the separate funnels do so .",
    "this result explicitly demonstrates the longer time scale of the interfunnel dynamics .",
    "the order of equilibration within each funnel is the same at all three energies studied , irrespective of the funnel in which the probability is initiated .",
    "there is a small exception in graph ( e ) , where minimum @xmath141 in the icosahedral funnel equilibrates with @xmath142 and @xmath143 before it joins @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "interestingly , the lowest - energy icosahedral minimum , @xmath142 , is one of the last minima to reach equilibrium within the icosahedral funnel , presumably because of the high barriers surrounding it@xcite .",
    "the equilibration of the fcc funnel is much more sensitive to the initial probability than that of the icosahedral funnel , in spite of the fact that the rate constants , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , are roughly equal at @xmath147 .",
    "this difference in behaviour of the two funnels arises from the fact that the absolute probabilities of the minima in the fcc funnel , other than the global minimum itself , are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the minima in the icosahedral funnel .",
    "hence , small changes in probability due to transient flows easily disturb the equilibrium between minima in the fcc funnel , since distance from equilibrium is measured relative to the final probability by the left - hand side of inequality ( [ eq : eqtime ] ) .",
    "when the cluster starts in the global minimum , the probability of the fcc minima decreases monotonically , and the minima within the funnel can equilibrate with each other rapidly .",
    "when the probability is initialized in the lowest - energy icosahedral minimum , however , the influx of probability to the fcc funnel must pass through the minima within the funnel on its way to the global minimum , and the transients must settle down almost completely before equilibrium is permanently established .",
    "this effect is reflected by the shift of the equilibration nodes of the fcc funnel to later times as one goes from the left - hand to right - hand side equilibration graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig : eqtrees ] .    at sufficiently low energy , the global potential energy minimum must be the most populated state at equilibrium .",
    "however , we have seen that there is a kinetic bottleneck to entering its funnel .",
    "hence , if the cluster is prepared in a liquid - like state , it is most likely to collapse into the icosahedral funnel , which is larger and structurally more similar to the liquid , even though it is not the equilibrium state . over a sufficiently long time",
    ", the cluster must then convert to the global minimum .",
    "our master equation model shows this behaviour clearly .",
    "starting from a uniform distribution amongst the 25 highest - energy minima in the sample , @xmath148 and @xmath149 were monitored as the system evolved towards equilibrium at the low energy of @xmath147 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fastslow ] .",
    "the initial states decay rapidly into other non - funnel states , and the two funnels experience a slow increase in population .",
    "although some probability enters the fcc funnel , it reaches a plateau while the population of the icosahedral funnel continues to grow .",
    "this growth reaches a maximum before eventually decaying towards its equilibrium value , as the probability trickles into the global minimum .",
    "the icosahedral funnel acts as a kinetic trap , and only releases the cluster into the global minimum on a long time scale .",
    "we note that direct simulation of the trapping effect by standard md would therefore be highly problematic .    2    although fig .",
    "[ fig : fastslow ] unambiguously demonstrates the separate fast and slow contributions to the relaxation , the precise partitioning between the two funnels at the plateau stage can depend on the initial probability distribution .",
    "the distribution chosen here is rather artificial because our sample of minima does not extend into the liquid - like range .",
    "if we could release the system from a high - temperature liquid - like state , the fraction of probability flowing into the icosahedral funnel would probably be even larger because of the greater structural similarity of the liquid - like structures with the icosahedral rather than fcc minima .",
    "although the fraction of fcc minima is already small in our database , it would be much smaller in a more comprehensive sample .",
    "two - stage dynamics have been observed experimentally in the folding of hen egg lysozyme , in which two routes to the native state have been postulated : one fast and direct , the other passing via partially folded conformations which act as kinetic traps and reorganize to the native state only slowly@xcite .",
    "conversely , the protein plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 rapidly folds to the active state , but converts to an inactive form on a much slower time scale@xcite , implying that the active state is not the global free energy minimum but is only metastable , like the icosahedral minima in lj@xmath1 at low energy .",
    "similarly , human prion protein has two long - lived forms , whose relative stability can be adjusted by varying the ph .",
    "the time scale for conversion to the more stable form is of the order of days@xcite .",
    "we have applied the master equation to the structural databases for m@xmath0 and lj@xmath1 derived in previous work@xcite to model relaxation processes in these atomic clusters .",
    "this approach can be applied to time scales far longer than those accessible by direct simulation , and describes the behaviour of an equilibrating ensemble without the need to average over separate trajectories .",
    "the harmonic approximation for the density of states of individual minima and transition states provides a simple but physically clear basis for calculating equilibrium properties and rate constants .",
    "provided it is not applied at excessively high temperatures , it gives a qualitatively useful description of the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the energy landscape .",
    "as we predicted@xcite , relaxation to the global minimum is slower when the range of the potential is shorter .",
    "an optimal temperature for this relaxation is obtained by a compromise between the decreasing rates at low temperatures and the decreasing thermodynamic driving force at high temperatures . when the range of the potential is long , the cluster exhibits a wide temperature window over which relaxation is quite efficient .",
    "in contrast , when the range is short , small deviations from the optimal temperature hinder the rate appreciably .",
    "although the relaxation profiles of the total energy at fixed temperature do not appear to be well described by any of the commonly used empirical forms , the temperature dependence of the mean relaxation time followed an arrhenius law for @xmath115 and a vogel  tammann  fulcher law at @xmath78 .",
    "these results again reflect the greater uniformity of the short - range pes that was deduced in the landscape analysis .",
    "application of the analytic solution of the master equation to the low - energy database of lj@xmath1 required the removal of unimportant minima and transition states from the sample .",
    "`` dead - end '' minima were removed if their equilibrium probability fell below a low threshold at the temperature of interest .",
    "the relaxation modes of the resulting database were analysed using a flow index to extract the rate of passage between the two funnels on the energy landscape at low temperatures .",
    "the equilibration patterns within and between the funnels clearly revealed the double - funnel structure .",
    "high - energy distributions relaxed preferentially into the secondary funnel of icosahedral minima rather than the close - packed funnel surrounding the global minimum .",
    "this behaviour stems from the greater structural similarity of the liquid to the icosahedral minima , which is reflected in the patterns of connectivity on the pes .",
    "eventually , the cluster escaped from this kinetic trap into the global minimum , which is thermodynamically favoured at sufficiently low temperature .",
