    "the dependence of clustering on such galaxy properties is therefore a fundamental constraint on theories of galaxy formation , and it is also important when attempting to constrain cosmological parameters with galaxy redshift surveys , since the different types of galaxies trace the underlying dark matter distribution differently . in this paper , we present the modeling of the luminosity and colour dependent clustering of massive galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey - iii ( sdss - iii ; * ? ? ?",

    "the evolution of galaxy clustering on large scales ( characterized by the bias factor ) in the cmass sample was also found to be roughly consistent with passive evolution predictions .    while g13 presented the clustering measurements based on the dr9 sample , in this paper we move a step forward to perform the hod modeling to infer the connection between galaxies and the hosting dark matter halos , using the clustering measurements from the dr10 data .",
    "@xcite presented the first hod modeling result for an early cmass sample ( from the first semester of data ) . now with dr10 , the survey volume is more than 11 times larger than that in @xcite , which allows us to study the detailed relation between the properties ( specifically luminosity and colour ) of the cmass galaxies and their dark matter halos .",
