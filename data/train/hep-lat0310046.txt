    "finite density qcd  @xcite has attracted considerable attention in high energy physics , nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "many theorists now believe that qcd has a very rich structure when we study it in temperature and density parameter space , and some experimentalists want to reveal it .",
    "fodor and katz@xcite studied qcd at @xmath8 and at @xmath9 by the multiparameter reweighting method .",
    "if two measures at @xmath10 and @xmath9 overlap well , then the method works well .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 the method may not work due to the phase effect .",
    "better overlap may be obtained by a simulation with a phase - quenching measure@xcite . here",
    "the difference between two measures is a complex phase @xmath11 .",
    "if the phase fluctuates very much , then the method again fails , which is expected to happen for large @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate the behavior of the complex phase in @xmath12 parameter space . in this study , we calculate the complex phase for various @xmath13 and @xmath0 and study the phase fluctuation .",
    "furthermore , we use the complex phase to obtain results at finite @xmath0 .",
    "the lattice partition function for ks fermions is given by @xmath14 we use the phase - quenching measure @xmath15 @xmath16 in our monte carlo simulations .",
    "we perform calculations on a @xmath3 lattice at @xmath17 for @xmath18 using the r - algorithm .",
    "the trajectory length is set at @xmath19 with a step size of @xmath20 .",
    "the first @xmath21 trajectories were discarded for thermalization .    for @xmath22 ,",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the expectation value with the phase - quenching measure .    to obtain the phase @xmath26 of the fermion determinant , it is necessary to calculate the fermion determinant .",
    "we consider two methods for calculating @xmath2 : ( i ) calculation of eigenvalues , ( ii ) lu factorization .",
    "we found that lu factorization is much faster than method ( i ) .",
    "thus we have decided to use method ( ii ) for the phase calculations .     for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as functions of @xmath13 ]",
    "figure  [ cos ] shows the fluctuations of @xmath28 .",
    "the fluctuations increase with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the fluctuations decrease for @xmath29 , where critical coupling @xmath30 is around @xmath31 .    using the phase @xmath26 of @xmath2",
    ", we estimate the reweighted values of the chiral condensate @xmath32 according to reweighting formula ( [ eq : reweight ] ) , i.e. , @xmath33     for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as functions of @xmath13 ]    figure  [ chiral ] shows the graphs of the no phase case and the reweighted case .",
    "values for the reweighted case are very similar to those for the no phase case .",
    "the latter agrees with the @xmath0 behavior reported by kogut and sinclair  @xcite .     for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as functions of @xmath13 ]",
    "figure  [ polyakov ] shows polyakov lines for the no phase case and the reweighted case .",
    "the two are also almost the same . in our approach",
    ", the conjugate gradient method does not converge at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we are performing simulations below @xmath36 .",
    "if we can perform simulations above @xmath36 , we might see the difference between the two cases .",
    "why does the phase effect not appear ?",
    "aarts et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a partial summation in configuration @xmath37 connected by @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "let us write a set of link variables @xmath38 after the @xmath7 transformation , i.e. , we multiply @xmath39 to all @xmath40 on a time slice . since @xmath41 is an element of @xmath1 , @xmath42 .",
    "the gauge action is invariant , @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 the same is true for @xmath45",
    ". then we obtain @xmath46 for any configuration @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath45 will appear in a whole set of ensembles .",
    "therefore , it is worth calculating the following partial summation in configuration @xmath37 connected by @xmath7 symmetry : @xmath47 it is interesting to see whether the phase disappears in @xmath48 .",
    "we are now trying to calculate this quantity .",
    "we calculated the fluctuation of the phase of @xmath2 on a @xmath3 lattice at @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the region of small @xmath13 ,",
    "the fluctuations are large .",
    "we calculated the chiral condensate @xmath32 and the polyakov line @xmath49 in both no phase and reweighted cases .",
    "there is no difference between them .",
    "we are currently running at @xmath50 , varying @xmath13 through the crossover region .",
    "we are trying to recognize these no phase effects below @xmath6 in terms of @xmath7 symmetry . for more larger @xmath0",
    ", it is expected that this reweighting method will be effective .",
    "we must try to calculate the case of @xmath34 .",
    "the calculations of gluon energy density and fermion number density are also in progress now .",
