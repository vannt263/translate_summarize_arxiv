    "astrophysical reaction rates are central to any investigation in nucleosynthesis as they provide the quantitative description of temporal abundance changes in a hot plasma .",
    "they are related to reaction cross sections which , in turn , may be predicted in theoretical models or extracted from experiments .",
    "compared to standard nuclear physics investigations of reactions on the ground state ( g.s . ) of nuclei , a treatment of reaction rates is complicated by the thermal population of excited states in the nuclei which are in thermal equilibrium with their hot environment . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as thermal equilibrium is upheld , there is a mathematically rigorous reciprocity relation connecting the rates of forward and reverse reaction @xcite .",
    "this implies that only the _ stellar rate _ for one direction , say , @xmath1 has to be determined by theoretical or experimental means .",
    "the _ stellar rate _ for its inverse reaction @xmath2 automatically follows by applying the simple reciprocity relations .",
    "determining contributions of reactions proceeding on excited states of nuclei to the stellar rate remains an experimental challenge .",
    "therefore it is interesting to theoretically investigate not only the magnitude of the contributions for each reaction but also which reaction direction is impacted less by such contributions .",
    "a determination of the rate in that direction would then be closer to the actually required stellar value .",
    "it is easy to show that fewer excited state transitions are involved in a stellar rate of a reaction with positive reaction @xmath0 value than in one with negative @xmath0 value .",
    "this is especially important for intermediate mass and heavy nuclei , whereas in light nuclei excited state ontributions are often small in either reaction direction , anway .",
    "the well - known `` @xmath0 value rule '' follows directly , stating that for astrophysical purposes it is preferrable to use the direction of positive @xmath0 value @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently , however , that an effect termed `` coulomb suppression of excited state contributions '' can lead to a violation of this rule when the coulomb barriers in entrance and exit channels are very different @xcite . since the relevant contributions of reactions on excited states involve different relative interaction energies , depending on the excitation energies of the participating excited states and the reaction @xmath0 value , coulomb barriers in entrance and exit channel act differently .",
    "@xcite provided an in - depth investigation of this effect across the nuclear chart and also discussed the relevance in nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "it focused , however , on a comparison of the stellar enhancement factors ( sefs ) in the forward and reverse reaction direction .",
    "later it was shown that the sef is not always a good measure of how reactions on excited states contribute to the stellar rate @xcite . in this work , a similar investigation of the suppression effect is performed but using the better suited g.s .   and",
    "excited state contributions to the stellar rate to check whether the conclusions of the previous investigation still hold and to provide updated tables .",
    "the sef @xmath3 is defined as the ratio of the stellar rate @xmath4 and reactivity @xmath5 relative to the ground state ( g.s . )",
    "rate @xmath6 and reactivity @xmath7 , respectively , @xcite @xmath8 at a plasma temperature @xmath9 .",
    "while coulomb suppression certainly drives the sef value towards unity , a value close to 1.0 can not be interpreted _ a priori _ as that excited state contributions are negligible .",
    "later it has been shown that the more useful quantity to consider is the g.s .",
    "contribution to the stellar rate , @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the g.s .",
    "spin of the target nucleus and @xmath12 is the temperature - dependent partition function , defined as @xmath13 the sum runs over g.s .",
    "( @xmath14 ) and excited states ( @xmath15 ) at excitation energy @xmath16 .",
    "the sef can be close to unity even when excited state contributions are sizeable whereas @xmath17 directly shows the impact of such contributions , being @xmath18 when they are negligible and @xmath19 when they dominate the rate @xcite .",
    "laboratory measurements only provide cross sections for nuclei in their g.s . , and thus @xmath6 , except for @xmath20ta which naturally occurs in its long - lived isomer .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 is the quantity of interest also to experimentalists because it shows what fraction of the stellar rate can be constrained by measurements .",

    "contrary to common wisdom ",
    "some endothermic reactions exhibit smaller g.s .",
    "contributions to the stellar reaction rate than their exothermic counterparts and are thus preferable for experimental and theoretical studies , if one of the reaction directions is found to be important in a hot plasma . the main cause of suppression of the excited state contributions in an endothermic reaction is the coulomb suppression of transitions with low relative interaction energy @xcite . the larger number of cases is due to the different temperature dependence of the g.s",

    "contribution to the stellar rate is larger in the endothermic direction .",
    "otherwise , a determination of the cross sections of the exothermic reaction would be preferrable for astrophysical application , if feasible .",
