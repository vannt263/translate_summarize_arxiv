    "modelling of dynamical systems is one of the most embracing area of interest among physicists and mathematicians in general @xcite .",
    "very popular among these models are systems that are low - dimensional dynamics @xcite , which besides the simple modelling , such systems can present a very complex dynamics leading to a rich variety of nonlinear phenomena @xcite , including bifurcations in nonsmooth dynamical systems @xcite .    here",
    "we study the problem of a bouncing ball model , where a free particle is suffering collisions with a vibrating wall under the presence of a constant gravitational field .",
    "holmes @xcite and pustylnikov @xcite were among the first to study the bouncing ball dynamics .",
    "this model has been used in many physical and engineering applications .",
    "for instance , it describes a similar acceleration phenomenon that cosmic rays experiences to acquire high energies @xcite ; the dynamic stability in human performance , where a human tries to stabilise a ball on a vibrating tennis racquet @xcite ; and the subharmonic vibrations waves in a nanometre - sized mechanical contact system @xcite .",
    "one can also find studies in granular materials @xcite , experimental devices concerning normal coefficient of restitution @xcite , mechanical vibrations @xcite , anomalous transport and diffusion @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , chaos control @xcite , besides the well known connection with the standard mapping @xcite , which leads to other several applications .",
    "although the bouncing ball problem has been studied for many years @xcite , concerning different aspects and applications , the implications of the nonlinear perturbation requires an extensive and complex analysis where some chaotic properties are not yet well fully understood . in this paper",
    "we consider a high dissipative bouncing ball model where a coefficient of restitution plays the role of dissipation , and the perturbation parameter is physically interpreted as a ratio between the moving plate acceleration and the gravitational field .",
    "for some combinations of parameters , a plenty of attractors can coexist @xcite .",
    "we found that these attractors in the phase space are intertwined , and varying the value of the control parameter of perturbation , we characterize a boundary crisis @xcite between the stable and unstable manifold of the same saddle point .",
    "such crisis leads to a successive destruction of these intertwined attractors and plays the role of a mechanism that allows the bottom attractor , which is related with the vibrating wall , still exist , giving to the attractor the status of a robust one .",
    "also , we setup an impact physical crisis , between the real vibrating plate and the border of an attractor .",
    "this `` unclassified impact crisis '' can work as mechanism to reduce the number of attractors , in the sense that before the crises we have plenty of attractors , and after it , only few of them are still present in the dynamics .",
    "the organization of the paper is given as follows : in sec.[sec2 ] we describe the dynamical system under study and its chaotic properties .",
    "section [ sec3]a is devoted to the numerical analysis of the average velocity , in sec.[sec3]b we study the basin of attraction of the fixed points and set up the impact physical crisis , and in sec.[sec3]c we discuss the relation between the manifolds boundary crisis and the attractors ; finally in sec.[sec4 ] we draw some final remarks and conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the model under study , so called bouncer model , which consists of a particle , under the influence of a constant gravitational field , that suffers inelastic collisions with a heavy oscillating wall .",
    "dissipation is introduced via a restitution coefficient @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 recovers the conservative case , where fa is inherent @xcite .",
    "the introduction of dissipation can be considered as a suppression mechanism for this unlimited energy growth @xcite .",
    "the system is oriented along the vertical axis , where the upward direction is said to be positive , the wall equilibrium position is set in @xmath2 , and the dynamics is basically described by a non - linear mapping for the variables velocity of the particle @xmath3 and time @xmath4 immediately after a @xmath5 collision of the particle with the vibrating wall .",
    "there are two distinct versions of the dynamics description : _",
    "( i ) _ complete one , which consists in considering the complete movement of the time - dependent wall , and _",
    "( ii ) _ simplified , where the wall is assumed to be fixed , but exchange momentum and energy with the particle upon collision .",
    "both approaches produce a very similar dynamics considering conservative @xcite and dissipative cases @xcite . in the complete version ,",
    "the vibrating wall obeys the equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively , the amplitude and the frequency of oscillation of the vibrating wall . in the simplified version , the vibrating wall is said to be fixed at @xmath2 , but when the particle collides with it , they exchange momentum and energy as if the wall were vibrating .",
    "thus , the simplified approach keeps the nonlinearity of the model and at the same time , significantly serves to speed up the numerical simulations , as well allows easier analytical calculations . in this paper and from this point beyond",
    ", we only deal with the complete version of the mapping .    considering the flight time , which is the time that the particle spends to go up , stops with zero velocity , starts falling and collides again with the vibrating wall",
    ", we define some dimensionless and more convenient variables as : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the  new dimensionless velocity \" , @xmath12 is the gravitational field and @xmath13 can be understood as a ration between accelerations of the vibrating wall and the gravitational field .",
    "for instance , one can set some real values for the dimensional variables , as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and obtain the dimensionless variable @xmath18 .",
    "some real devices concerning impact experiments with granular material can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "also , measuring the time in terms of the number of oscillations of the vibrating wall @xmath19 , we obtain the mapping @xmath20~~{\\rm mod ( 2\\pi)}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",
    ", \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where the expressions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the kind of the considered collision . for the case of multiple collisions inside the collision zone",
    "@xmath23 $ ] , the expressions are @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is obtained from the condition that matches the same position for the particle and the vibrating wall , expressed as @xmath27 where this transcendental equation must be solved numerically for @xmath28 , with @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "if the particle leaves the collision zone case after a collision , goes up , reach null velocity , and falls for an another collision , we have indirect collisions and the expressions are @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting the time spent by the particle in the upward direction up to reaching the null velocity , @xmath33 corresponds to the time that the particle spends from the place where it had zero velocity up to the entrance of the collision zone at @xmath13 .",
    "finally the term @xmath26 has to be obtained numerically from the equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents a transcendental equation that must be solved numerically in order to find the exact `` time '' of collision , as @xmath36 , with @xmath37.$ ]     and @xmath38 , and in ( b ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in ( b ) the thick black regions are the sinks and the bottom attractor .",
    "also , all the spread dots are the transient.__,width=340 ]    taking the determinant of the jacobian matrix of both kinds of collisions , and after a straightforward algebra , it is easy to show that the mapping ( [ eq1 ] ) shrinks the phase space measure since the determinant of the jacobian matrix is given by @xmath41~. \\label{eq5}\\ ] ] here , if @xmath1 we recover the non - dissipative version of the mapping , in fact , as velocity and phase are not canonical pairs in the complete version , the determinant of @xmath42 is not the unity , but rather it leads to the following measure to be preserved , @xmath43 . indeed , the extended phase space for the whole version of the model considers four variables namely : ( 1 ) @xmath44 denoting the position of the vibrating wall ; ( 2 ) @xmath45 corresponding to the velocity of the particle ; ( 3 ) @xmath46 which is the mechanical energy ( kinetic+gravitational ) of the particle and ( 4 ) the time @xmath4 .",
    "the canonical pairs however are : position and velocity @xmath47 and ; energy and time @xmath48 .",
    "another useful property for the dynamics evolution , as function of the control parameters , is the analysis of the fixed points and their stability .",
    "for the bouncer model the period-1 fixed points can be obtained by doing @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the eq.([eq1 ] ) . for both kinds of collisions ,",
    "successive and indirect , the fixed points are @xmath51    their stability are given by @xmath52 , evaluated over the fixed points , where @xmath53 are the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix and @xmath54 is the identity matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues can be found solving the expression @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "+ figure [ fig1 ] shows a comparison between the phase space for the conservative and dissipative versions . as the dynamics evolves",
    ", the introduction of dissipation destroys the invariant curves in the stability islands , and the stable fixed points become sinks @xcite .",
    "depending of the control parameter , there may have a plenty of these attractors , where the orbits converge to them .",
    "in fig.[fig1 ] one can see that after the dissipation was introduced the first three stability islands , denoted by white regions among the chaotic sea in fig.[fig1](a ) , became attracting fixed points . also , there is the presence of an attractor on the bottom of fig.[fig1](b ) , near where the vibrating wall is located . for a better understanding and visualization",
    ", we are going to use in all figures the phase representation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in this section , we describe the results obtained by the numerical simulations .",
    "first we draw some average velocity curves for a combination of the two control parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath58 . then , the basins of attraction of some attracting fixed points are obtained .",
    "we investigate how these basins of attraction behave , as we range the control parameters .",
    "we constructed some bifurcation diagrams for the fixed points and analysed how their stability vary . by drawing the unstable and stable manifolds we notice that the attractors are intertwined in the phase space , and there is a boundary crises , a crossing of their manifolds , which creates a successive mechanism of destruction for all attractors originated by the sinks .",
    "also , we made a study over the bifurcation process and the chaotic properties of it .",
    "let us set the equation for the average velocity , which depends on both @xmath13 and @xmath58 .",
    "the statistics was made considering two steps , an average taken along the orbit , evolved until a finite high number of collisions @xmath59 and an average taken along the ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "so , we may define     and @xmath58 . in ( a ) and ( c )",
    ", we have a high dissipation and low @xmath13 , and the dynamics are basically controlled by the attracting fixed points . in ( b ) and",
    "( d ) , we have small dissipation and high @xmath13 . here",
    "the dynamics is ruled by the attractor localized in the bottom , embedded with the vibrating wall . also , in ( d ) a rearrange in the horizontal axis is made , in order to make all the curves start to grow together .",
    "this rearrange is convenient , when we make use of the scaling techniques.__,width=359,height=377 ]    @xmath60    and hence @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents an ensemble of initial conditions .",
    "the index @xmath63 and @xmath64 represent respectively the collision number , and the number of initial conditions .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] , shows the evolution of the average velocity for an extensive range of the control parameters @xmath13 and @xmath58 as function of the number of collisions . here , we consider two regimes : _ ( i ) _ high dissipation and small @xmath13 , and _",
    "( ii ) _ small dissipation and high @xmath13 .",
    "one can identify very distinct behaviour between both regimes .",
    "considering regime _ ( i ) _ , as shown in figs.[fig2](a , c ) , we see that the @xmath65 curves start with high initial velocity near @xmath66 , given as an initial condition , and experience an exponential decay , @xcite . after a transient they bend towards different regimes of saturation in low energy levels .",
    "basically , the orbits are attracted by the several fixed points that coexist in the phase space , when the perturbation parameter @xmath13 is still small enough , therefore marking their convergence to different plateaus . on the other hand , in regime _",
    "( ii ) _ , as present in fig.[fig2](b , d ) , the @xmath65 curves start with low initial velocity , near @xmath66 given as an initial condition , and they experience a growth for short time according to a power law with exponent @xmath67 , until they bend towards a saturation regime , in a high energy levels . for this case , the saturation plateaus of high energy are connected with the chaotic attractor , and there are no attracting fixed points for such high energy regime .",
    "also , if we rescale the horizontal axis by @xmath68 all @xmath65 curves , start to grow together . for a more complete investigation on the _ ( ii ) _ regime concerning the chaotic attractor behaviour and a fully scaling analysis on the @xmath65 curves , we recommend refs.@xcite for a numerical point of view , and refs.@xcite for an analytical interpretation .",
    "however , in this paper , we are interested in the regime of high dissipation and small @xmath13 , shown in figs.[fig2](a , c ) , where the attracting fixed points still exist and play an important role in the dynamics .",
    "indeed , this high dissipation analysis can be very useful in a further experimental analysis of the bouncer model , once they are easily obtained , instead of the tiny dissipations as used in refs.@xcite , that would be impossible to obtain in a laboratory . also , one could think about experience with granular materials interacting with vibrating plates @xcite , as a direct application of the bouncer model and its phenomena .       and @xmath69 .",
    "the colors represent the fixed points were the initial conditions are being attracted to .",
    "black @xmath70 , red @xmath71 , green , @xmath72 , blue @xmath73 , yellow @xmath74 and brown @xmath75 , and the white regions denotes initial conditions that converged to the bottom attractor.__,width=340 ]        depending on the combination of the control parameters @xmath13 and @xmath58 , several attracting fixed points can coexist in the phase space , where some of them can be more influential to the dynamics than other . in order to understand how these attracting fixed points behave as related to initial conditions , fig.[fig3 ]",
    "shows a basin for the periodic attractors for @xmath76 and @xmath69 , where a grid of @xmath77 initial conditions were equally split and set in the axis of velocity @xmath78 $ ] and phase @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "the different colors represent the basins of attraction for each attractor of period-1 located in @xmath80 , according the fixed points obtained in eq.([eq6 ] ) . here",
    ", each initial condition were evolved up to a transient of @xmath81 collisions , and then we marked its final velocity in the phase space .",
    "since , we have a positive restitution coefficient , one may think that the particle would  glue \" on the vibrating wall for long times .",
    "this indeed can happen , if it lands deep enough in the absorbing region of the phase space , the particle will perform a large number of smaller and smaller bounces , that could follow progressive geometric conversions @xcite .",
    "such peculiar behaviour is known as locking @xcite .",
    "the white regions in fig.[fig3 ] denotes the initial conditions that converged to the locking region attractor , i. e. the bottom attractor embedded with the vibrating wall .",
    "however , if the particle has a positive relative velocity , it will not be glued to the wall . and , depending of the on the control parameters , this velocity can acquire multiplicity , in different regions of the phase space , giving birth to periodic attractors . in fig.[fig3",
    "] , each color denotes a different period-1 fixed point basin of attraction .",
    "as @xmath82 is increased , it seems that the basins are getting smaller , which could be a possible indication of less influence in the dynamics . also , for the higher values of @xmath82 , the boundaries of the basins , that are limited by the unstable manifolds of each fixed point @xcite , behave in a very complicated stretching and mixing way , folding themselves like a horseshoe @xcite .",
    "the beautiful mazy behaviour of the basins of attraction shown in fig.[fig3 ] , can drastically change , when @xmath13 is increased .",
    "as one can see in fig.[fig4 ] , where the evolution of the basin of attractions for @xmath83 and some values of @xmath13 is shown .",
    "each item of fig.[fig4 ] was constructed considering a grid of initial conditions of @xmath84 equally distributed along the velocity @xmath85 $ ] and phase @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "the color scale represents the final velocity of each pair of initial condition after a transient of @xmath81 iterations .",
    "the color scale was kept fixed as the final velocity ranges . for low velocities and orbits that were attracted to the bottom attractor , we have the darker colors as black , dark blue ( black ) .",
    "the orbits that were attracted by the first two sinks , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the color scale ranges from blue ( dark gray ) to yellow ( light gray ) , and for the high velocity attracting orbits ( said above @xmath87 ) , we have the color range scale between yellow ( light gray ) and red ( dark gray ) .     for @xmath83 .",
    "it is shown a scenario of the evolution of the attracting fixed points , where attractors originated by the sinks @xmath80 , coexist with period-3 orbits originated by tangent bifurcations , the bottom attractor ( given by the dashed line ) and others attractors .",
    "this figure illustrates the plenty of attractors and the high active dynamic structure that orbits may experience . also , three critical values of @xmath13 concerning the crises are characterized.__,width=340,height=453 ]    in figure [ fig4 ] , as @xmath13",
    "is increased , the boundaries of the basins of attraction start to grow following the stretching and mixing behaviour , just like the smale horseshoes , @xcite , as figs.[fig4](a , b , c ) displays , where in particular for fig.[fig4](a ) , the sink located in @xmath86 did not exist yet , the same applies for fig.[fig4](b ) , where the sink located in @xmath86 also did not exist .",
    "one can check that by the period-1 one fixed points expressions , specially for @xmath88 .",
    "as we increase @xmath13 , the sinks located in @xmath80 start to notice the consequences of being lied intertwined with the bottom attractor .",
    "considering the first sink @xmath86 , it suffers a tangent bifurcation in @xmath89 ( this bifurcation will be explained in the manifolds section ) , which creates three new attracting zones inside its own basin of attraction , as shows fig.[fig4](d ) . raising the value of @xmath13 a little bit , the sink in @xmath86 , bifurcates , creating , together with the other sinks , a plenty of attracting regions in the phase space , as shown in fig.[fig4](e ) .",
    "the crises happens near @xmath90 , shown in fig.[fig4](f ) .",
    "after the tangent bifurcation in @xmath91 , three branches evolves as @xmath13 increases .",
    "the two upper branches collide with each other , generating a boundary crises that destroys both branches . at the same parameter",
    "@xmath92 , the lower branch , suffers a physical collision with the vibrating boundary .",

    "this non categorized crises can be better visualized in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "finally , in figs.[fig4](g , h ) , the basin of attraction of the fixed point @xmath86 ( said together with the branches of the tangent bifurcation ) is totally destroyed , and the other basins of attraction for the other upper sinks started their successive destruction process . in the end , when we have a large enough value of @xmath13 , only the bottom attractor remains in the system .        for",
    "a better understanding and visualization of the crises , sinks bifurcations and the evolution of the basins of attraction , we constructed a bifurcation diagram for some fixed points , as shows fig.[fig5 ] , for a fixed dissipation @xmath83 .",
    "the diagram illustrates the plenty of attractors and the high active dynamic structure that orbits may experience during the time evolution .",
    "this diagram was constructed in two different ways : _ ( i ) _ we have an initial condition very near the sinks , and let it follows the attractor , as @xmath13 increases ; and ( _ ii ) _ we kept the same initial condition for every value of @xmath13 . in both cases ,",
    "the range of @xmath13 was split in @xmath93 equal parts .",
    "considering the evolution in ( _ i ) _ , the dynamics follows a regular bifurcation diagram , where the period-1 sinks located in @xmath80 , stay stable until them suffer successive bifurcations as @xmath13 increases , until it finally disappear . in the same manner",
    ", tangent bifurcations happen for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and so on .",
    "these new branches for each tangent bifurcation , have the same fate of the attractors originated by the sinks .",
    "these fixed points of the tangent bifurcation were obtained considering case _",
    "( ii ) _ , where the evolution of the same initial condition , gives rise to different attractors in the bifurcation diagram , for example , the one located near @xmath94 , basically suffers the same bifurcation process as the main ones and then it is destroyed .",
    "one can notice in fig.[fig5 ] , that there are three critical values : _",
    "@xmath89 , which is the value of @xmath13 where the tangent bifurcation occurs for the first sink @xmath86 ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath90 , which is the critical parameter where the crises occurs for the three branches originated in the tangent bifurcation .",
    "one can see in fig.[fig5 ] , that in @xmath95 , there are two simultaneous crisis .",
    "the upper two branches collide , and destroy each other , and at the same `` time '' , the lower branch , physically collides with the vibrating wall , denoted here by the dashed line , characterizing an yet unclassified physical crises , between the real structure ( vibrating wall ) , and the border of an attractor . finally , _ ( iii ) _",
    "@xmath96 , is the value where the attractor originated by the sink @xmath86 is destroyed . beyond @xmath96 ,",
    "a successive destruction mechanism takes place in the dynamics , destroying all the other attractors , except by the bottom one , that starts to rule the dynamics .",
    "the values of these critical @xmath13 parameters may vary as we range the dissipation .",
    "let us now address to the chaotic attractor born from the bifurcation process of the fixed point @xmath86 .",
    "as one can see from fig.[fig5 ] , when the bifurcation process occurs , we have the creation of two symmetric branches originated in the main bifurcation .",
    "according to fig.[fig5 ] , each branch , will begin its own bifurcation process , which further will collide with itself in a boundary crises , generating its own local chaotic attractor .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows how these processes occur for the first sink , presenting the shape of the attractors in the phase space , also we compare it with amplifications of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "once , both branches are symmetric , let us do this analysis considering just one of them .",
    "one can see in figs.[fig6](a , b ) the behaviour of bifurcation process of the branches as @xmath13 is increased . comparing them with fig.[fig6](c ) , for @xmath97 , we can see that the attractor is under a period-8 bifurcation .",
    "increasing @xmath13 , and after a comparison between figs.[fig6](a , b ) and figs.[fig6](d , e ) ; the two branches of the attractor merge together into one local chaotic attractor .",
    "here we can characterize another crisis between the attractors , where two attractors become one .",
    "such crisis is known as fusion one @xcite .",
    "finally , in fig.[fig6](f ) we have the behaviour of the local chaotic attractor in its final stage for @xmath98 , where it seems to take the shape of the old basin of attraction , originated by the tangent bifurcation , and then it vanishes . here , another crises can be characterized .",
    "the attractor ( darker region ) , collides with the transient basin of the old attractor already destroyed ( originated by the tangent bifurcation ) .",
    "this ghost behaviour of the transient basin @xcite , allows to the attractor to interact with the region that suffered the physical collision with the vibrating wall .",
    "this interaction , destroys the attractor in the same manner that destroy the previous one in @xmath99 .",
    "one can ask about the nature of this local chaotic attractor .",
    "indeed , it seems to have fractal shape , as one can see in the successive amplification of figs.[fig7](a , b , c , d ) .",
    "the shape of the chaotic attractor is basically the same , no matter how much further in the zoom windows .",
    "it is interesting , the fact that the kind of crises we are seeing here , are basically the same ones found in the henon - heiles attractor @xcite , where the chaotic attractor collides with the stable manifold and is destroyed .",
    "also , the same fractal - like shape of the chaotic attractor is found .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate later , if any other chaotic property comom related between both attractors can be found .",
    "let us address now to the crises related with the manifolds .",
    "it is well known in the literature that a saddle fixed point , in the plane @xmath100 has stable and unstable manifolds @xcite .",
    "the stable manifolds are formed by a family of trajectories that turn away from the saddle fixed point .",
    "one of them evolves to the chaotic bottom attractor , or visit the region of the chaotic bottom attractor after the event of crisis ; while the other one evolves towards an attracting fixed point .",
    "these unstable manifolds are obtained from the iteration of the map @xmath101 with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "similarly , the construction of stable manifolds are a little bit more complicated since the inverse of the mapping , say @xmath102 , must be obtained . here",
    "the operator follows @xmath103 .",
    "so after some algebra , we have    . in ( a ) @xmath76 and in ( b ) @xmath104 .",
    "one can see that in ( a ) there is no crossing between the manifolds of either saddle fixed points , and in ( b ) the boundary crisis occurred for both saddle points.__,width=321,height=453 ]    @xmath105-\\nu^2~\\\\ \\end{array } \\right .",

    ", the function @xmath107 must be solved numerically , once it depends on both @xmath11 and @xmath108 .",
    "so , we made use of the newton s method to find the root , where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the procedure for obtaining the stable manifolds is the same as that one used for the unstable manifolds , however , instead of iterating the map @xmath101 we must iterate its inverse @xmath102 .",
    "we set a tiny circle of radius @xmath111 , and split @xmath112 initial conditions around the respective saddle point and iterate the normal and reverse dynamics .",
    "after that , we make a zoom - in the region of the saddle point , and made a linear fit in both branches of the unstable and stable manifolds , in order to find the eigenvectors . after that",
    ", we just evolve the normal and reverse dynamics again , but considering the distribution of initial conditions along the linear fit of the manifolds branches . just for notice",
    "the saddles are localized in @xmath80 and @xmath113 . for closed domain dynamical systems , such as the fermi - ulam model and other time - dependent billiards @xcite",
    ", the unstable manifolds generate the border of the basin of attraction of the chaotic attractor and the stable manifolds draw the boundaries of the basin of the attracting sinks , a boundary crises happens when the stable manifold touches the unstable manifold of the same saddle fixed points due to a modification of the control parameter . in this case , the chaotic attractor is destroyed , and only the sink remains in the system .",
    "this collision implies in a sudden destruction of the chaotic attractor and also of its basin of attraction @xcite .",
    "this destruction can be very useful as a mechanism of controlling chaos in this dissipative version of the model since , after the crisis event , the particle is captured by an attracting fixed point ( sink ) . however , the kind of crisis that happens in the unbounded bouncer model is a bit more complicated , once we have plenty of attractors , and their manifolds found themselves embedded .    stable and unstable manifolds for the first two saddle points for a dissipation value of @xmath83",
    "are displayed in fig.[fig8](a , b ) .",
    "both branches of the stable manifold behave as follows : the upward branch evolves to the attracting fixed point while the downward branch evolves to the chaotic attractor . in both figs.[fig8](a ,",
    "b ) , we see that the stable manifold for the saddle in @xmath87 , are embedded with the stable manifold of the saddle @xmath86 .",
    "both stable manifolds are also intertwined with the attractor in the bottom .",
    "we believe that this peculiar behaviour happens for all the saddles located above in the phase space for all values of @xmath80 , creating a whole chain of iteration between the attracting fixed points and the attractor in the bottom .",
    "also , in both figs.[fig8](a , b ) the two branches of the unstable manifold generate the basin boundaries for both attracting fixed points . here",
    ", there is no iteration between the unstable manifolds of different sinks .",
    "the unstable manifolds go up and up in the velocity axis , in a stretching and mixing way , drawing the limits of the attracting boundaries of each fixed point .",
    "one can imagine how they would behave just looking at fig.[fig3 ] , where the basin of attraction until @xmath114 is drawn",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the relations between the stretching and mixing of the manifolds with the smale horseshoe mapping .",
    "also , in fig.[fig8](a ) shows the embedded manifolds @xmath76 .",
    "one can notice here , that there is no crossings between the boundaries of the stable and unstable manifold of both saddle points yet , but we can visualize the tangent bifurcation occurring in the sink located in @xmath87 , where three branches rise and start to grow from the place where the sink should be located .",
    "one can also compare with fig.[fig5 ] , and confirm that this is the exactly control parameter of the tangent bifurcation .",
    "once we raise the value of the control parameter @xmath13 , the respective unstable and stable manifold from both saddle points cross each other , as show fig.[fig8](b ) , for @xmath104 .",
    "one could imagine that the crossing behaviour of the manifolds would destroy the attractor in the bottom , and let only the sink in the phase space .",
    "this indeed happens , but once the manifolds for all saddles found themselves embedded , this destruction seems not to cause greater effects in the dynamics . because even that for one saddle the attractor is destroyed , there will be the manifold from upper saddle points , embedding themselves with the region where the attractor was , giving an `` extra life time '' for the attractor , until the next boundary crises from the upper saddles , where the same process will occur in a successive way .",
    "we think , that the boundary crises between the manifolds , are serving as a trigger for the unbounded growth of the chaotic attractor in the bottom .",
    "one could imagine for higher values of @xmath13 , that the bottom chaotic can be very influential in the dynamics .",
    "if , we take @xmath115 , the bottom chaotic attractor would occupy the region where the first three sinks of period-1 should be located , and the crossing between the manifolds that we are seeing here in fig.[fig8 ] for low values of @xmath13 , would be happening for very high saddle points in the phase space .",
    "we dare to call this mechanism , as a regenerating process , or  robust attractor \" .     and @xmath83 , the basin of attraction of the first sink is tangent to the growing branch of the stable manifold embedded with the chaotic bottom attractor , generating a tangent bifurcation inside the attracting basin of the first sink .",
    "yet , one can look at and see that from the place where the sink should be located , are rising three new branches , as a result from the tangent behaviour between the manifolds . the comparison with the basin of attraction overlapped , shows better this behaviour.__,width=321,height=453 ]    still , we display the tangent bifurcation for the first sink in fig.[fig9 ] , where for @xmath116 , we overlap the basin of attraction with the stable and unstable manifold from the first saddle and the vibrating wall itself .",
    "we can see that the basin of the first sink is tangent the growing branch of the bottom attractor . at the same time",
    ", we can see three branches rising from the place where the sink should be located inside its basin of attraction .",
    "we also stress that if noise were added to the dynamics @xcite , the scenario of the crises might would change , once the perturbation would be different .",
    "of course , that noise should be consider in real experimental devices , so as a possible future work , we would be consider the introduction of noise in the system .",
    "the dynamics of a bouncing ball model is investigated for a high dissipation regime .",
    "some chaotic properties were set up , and average properties of the velocity were obtained .",
    "depending of the combination of control parameters many attractors can coexist , leading to a very complex dynamics in the phase space .",
    "basins of attraction for some attractors and their evolution with the increase of the perturbation parameter were characterized .",
    "increasing the perturbation parameter leads us to characterize an unusual class of boundary crises , where the attractor collides physically with the vibrating wall . in these crises we observed a reduction in the number of attractors in the phase space .",
    "these phenomena could be extended to other vibrating and impact systems with high dissipation regimes , as in human stability performance @xcite and microscopic vibration systems @xcite , in order to reduce the number of attractors ( stable vibration modes ) in such systems .",
    "also , we found the attractors are in an intertwined form .",
    "this was confirmed by the drawn of stable and unstable manifolds . here",
    ", when a crises between manifolds occurs , it creates a successive destruction mechanism for all the attractors originated by the sinks , giving an  extra life time \" to the bottom chaotic attractor , turning it into a robust attractor . as a future work",
    ", it would be interesting to see with the bifurcation follows the feigenbaum s @xmath117 relation , and if there would be any chance to find shrimp - like structures in the parameter space @xcite .",
    "also , we could consider the introduction of noise in the dynamics , to make a link with real experimental devices .",
