    "one of the challenges in understanding the properties of polymeric materials stems from the necessity of developing theoretical approaches that can describe in a comprehensive manner properties observed at many different length scales .",
    "the presence of several length scales in which relevant phenomena take place leads to the complex nature of the liquid , rendering its treatment a difficult matter @xcite .",
    "already in the description of the structure of homopolymer melts , two length scales need to be considered , which correspond to the monomer statistical segment length , @xmath1 , and the overall polymer dimension , i.e.  its radius of gyration , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total number of monomers in the chain . for diblock copolymers",
    ", the theoretical treatment is further complicated by the presence of a new length scale , which is intramolecular in character and corresponds to the size of a block .",
    "diblock copolymers are macromolecules in which a homopolymer chain of @xmath4 monomers of type @xmath5 is chemically bound to a second homopolymer chain of different chemical structure containing @xmath6 monomers of type @xmath7 , with @xmath8 .",
    "the block size is defined by its respective radius of gyration such that , for example , the spatial dimension of the block composed of @xmath5-type monomers is given by @xmath9 .",
    "diblock copolymers are systems of great interest for their technological applications @xcite . since the two blocks are chemically different , these experience a repulsive interaction that would encourage phase separation at low temperatures where entropy can not balance enthalpic effects .",
    "however , the chemical bond existent between the two blocks prevents a complete separation of the two phases . as a consequence , at low temperatures",
    "block copolymer liquids undergo a microphase transition from disordered systems to ordered microstructures of nanoscopic size , namely the microphase separation transition ( mst ) .",
    "the length scale characterizing the size of the microphase is of the order of the block radius of gyration .    with the purpose of developing the technology to produce micro - ordered structures of well - controlled size and shape ,",
    "an understanding is required of the processes that drive the formation of micro - ordered phases under different thermodynamic conditions of temperature @xmath10 and density @xmath11 , as well as different chain composition @xmath12 , monomer structure @xmath1 , and degree of polymerization @xmath3 .",
    "computer simulations serve as an extremely powerful tool to investigate phenomena in complex fluids @xcite .",
    "however , the limited power of present - day hardware does not allow for the simultaneous study of all length scales of interest .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is through `` multiscale modeling , '' where a set of simulations is performed at different levels of coarse - graining of the original system and in a subsequent step , information from different length scales is combined to provide the complete physical picture @xcite .",
    "with such an approach , however , the challenge is not only to find the appropriate computational technique for each length scale simulated , but also to know ( _ i _ ) the proper effective potential acting between coarse - grained units needed to carry out the simulations @xcite , and ( _ ii _ ) the proper procedure for combining information from different scales of modeling once simulation data is acquired .",
    "first - principles theoretical models apt to coarse grain diblock copolymer liquids at different length scales of interest provide the potentials needed as an input in multiscale simulations , as well as the formal framework to combine information obtained from simulations of the liquid coarse grained at different length scales @xcite . in a series of recent papers , we developed a coarse - graining approach that maps liquids of homopolymer chains into liquids of soft colloidal particles , providing a formal analytical `` transcale '' procedure @xcite .",
    "each effective soft colloid is centered on the polymer center of mass and interacts through a gaussian repulsive potential , which results in our formalism from the solution of ornstein - zernike integral equations .",
    "we later extended the same approach to describe the coarse - graining of homopolymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "computer simulations , performed by us , of coarse - grained polymer liquids and mixtures , where molecules interact by means of the derived effective pair potential , have been shown to reproduce quantitatively the structure and dynamics of the liquid at the center - of - mass level , while requiring considerably shorter computational time than that needed to perform united atom simulations @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", our approach is further developed to address the problem of modeling a melt of diblock copolymers as a liquid of interacting soft colloidal dumbbells .",
    "each dumbbell represents one macromolecule composed of two effective soft colloidal particles , which in turn are sized according to the radius of gyration of each block and centered on center - of - mass coordinates of each block .",
    "three different length scales are formally related , which correspond to coarse - graining the molecule at the monomer ( the statistical segment length , @xmath1 ) , block ( the radius of gyration of block @xmath5 , @xmath13 ) , and polymer ( the polymer radius of gyration , @xmath14 ) scales . in this way",
    ", our theory represents a minimal _ intra_molecular mesoscopic model of polymeric liquid structures .",
    "there has been a growing interest in providing models for coarse - graining block copolymers chains.@xcite for example , building blocks of supermolecular structures , such as cellular membranes , could be modeled as self - assembling block copolymers chains.@xcite a recent paper proposes a model of coarse - graining for a symmetric diblock copolymer similar to ours , as the chain is modeled as two soft blobs , tethered by an entropic spring.@xcite the blobs have equal size , and the coarse - grained total distribution functions are calculated numerically from a monte carlo simulation of diblock copolymers described at the monomer level .",
    "monomers occupy the sites of a simple cubic lattice , with bond along the x- , y- , or z - directions .",
    "the two blocks individually are modeled as if they where in theta solvent , while the interaction between them is self avoiding .",
    "the numerical inversion procedure to derive the coarse - grained potential is performed in the athermal regime .",
    "as the authors point out in the paper , their model is `` highly simplified '' , which proves the difficulty in treating intramolecular coarse - graining .",
    "the model , coupled with a reference interaction site model ( rism ) and a random - phase approximation closure , predicts the mean - field clustering of diblock copolymers in a selective solvent.@xcite    in this paper , we provide an analytical solution for the coarse - grained total distribution functions for a liquid of diblock copolymers represented as dumbbells of soft colloidal particles .",
    "our model differs from the one presented in ref.(@xcite ) in several ways . in our case",
    ", the size of the two `` blobs '' varies depending on the chain composition , @xmath12 , degree of polymerization , @xmath3 , and segment length , @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , repulsive interactions between segments of different chemical nature are quantified by the interaction parameter , @xmath15 .",
    "concentration - fluctuation stabilization enters through the polymer reference interaction site model ( prism ) theory for the monomer - level description,@xcite and deviations from mean - field theory@xcite are predicted by the coarse - grained approach as well .",
    "the two blocks follow gaussian intramolecular statistics , which is a good approximation for copolymer melts , when each block has a degree of polymerization @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , and for the region in the phase diagram from the high - temperature to the weak segregation regime ( @xmath18 for symmetric composition @xmath19 ) , where the system is isotropic . numerical mean",
    "field theory studies suggest coil stretching is not significant even below the order disorder transition until a strong segregation regime is entered , where @xmath20.@xcite analytical intermolecular total correlation functions between like and unlike coarse - grained blocks are predicted by our formalism as a function of chain composition , block size , density , temperature , as well as density- and concentration - fluctuation screening lengths .",
    "one advantage of our approach is that it is analytical .",
    "since a coarse - grained description is obtained by performing statistical averages over local ( small - scale ) degrees of freedom , it translates the energy of the system into the free energy of the renormalized fluid.@xcite in this way , the obtained total correlation functions and related effective potentials , are functions of all characteristic physical parameters defining the system under consideration , such as temperature @xmath10 , total site density @xmath11 , and degree of polymerization @xmath3 . for a diblock copolymer",
    ", the relevant parameters also include chain composition , @xmath12 , and the interaction parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 defines the proximity of the system to its order - disorder transition .",
    "for each set of parameters , total correlation functions and free energy change . as a result , a numerical solution of the coarse - grained description obtained from microscopic simulations requires performing a number of simulations equal to the number of combinations of those parameters , partially defeating the computational gains of a coarse - grained description .    the material in this paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "we start in section [ sx : blok ] with a derivation from the ornstein - zernike equation of the total correlation functions of diblock copolymer liquids coarse - grained at the block level .",
    "section [ sx : theo ] provides a theoretical description of diblock copolymer melts at the monomer level . in section [ sx : symm ] , we present an analytically tractable solution in reciprocal space for a structurally symmetric diblock copolymer melt .",
    "the fourier transform of the resulting expressions leads to analytical solutions of intermolecular total block - monomer and block - block pair correlation functions in real space , treated in section [ sx : symmr ] .",
    "our analytical approach for coarse - graining the diblock copolymer liquid at the center - of - mass level and comparisons with the corresponding presentation of the homopolymer melt are discussed in section [ sx : dcom ] .",
    "finally , our theoretical development in the _ athermal _ limit is compared with united atom molecular dynamics simulations of a polyethylene melt in section [ sx : comp ] , while temperature - dependent model calculations are presented in section [ sx : modl ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief discussion and appendices , where the auxiliary functions entering the exact solution of the total correlation functions , as well as the treatment of the block coarse - graining of a compositionally _ symmetric _ diblock , are presented .",
    "in this section , we derive the general expressions for the total pair correlation functions of the diblock copolymer liquid , coarse - grained at the level of the block length scale .",
    "the formalism is completely general and applies to any diblock copolymer system .",
    "the structure of a diblock copolymer liquid is characterized well by static correlation functions , which sample fluctuations of monomer units in the fluid . given the position of monomer @xmath23 belonging to block @xmath24 comprising a chain @xmath25 as @xmath26 , monomer fluctuations at a specific wave vector @xmath27 are represented by @xmath28 .",

    "since the liquid is spatially homogeneous and isotropic , the structure factors depend only on the modulus of the wave vector , @xmath35 .    in our coarse - grained description ,",

    "as the temperature decreases , the effective repulsive potential @xmath87 increases as @xmath88 , leading to the phase separation transition .",
    "this phase transition is characterized by a dramatic increase of the collective concentration fluctuation static structure factor , @xmath89 , at a specific length scale , @xmath90 . at the temperature of the phase transition ,",
    "only certain fluctuations become anomalously large and the liquid segregates on a molecular length scale on the order of the overall size of the molecule , @xmath91 .",
    "this remarkable property of copolymer liquids is due to the fact that , because of the connectivity between different blocks , even complete segregation can not lead to macroscopic phase separation , as occurs in mixtures of two chemically different homopolymer melts .",
    "since even at high temperatures , @xmath92 presents a peak due to the finite molecular size of the block copolymer chain , the peak position is largely independent of temperature .    the first theoretical approach to describe the microphase separation transition was a mean - field theory developed by leibler @xcite .",

    "copolymer melts , these corrections modify the predicted second - order phase transition for the symmetric diblock into a first - order phase transition .    a fluctuation corrected mean - field approach was later derived by fredrickson and helfand @xcite by implementing brazovskii s hartree approximation of landau - ginzburg field theory to treat diblock copolymer systems @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation corrected approach recovers leibler s results in the limit of infinite chain length .",
    "fredrickson - helfand predictions have been found to agree well with scattering experiments in the whole range of temperatures encompassing disordered to weakly ordered phases across the microphase separation .",
    "since these approaches focus on the single - chain free energy and the liquid is assumed to be incompressible , fluctuation stabilization is mainly of entropic origin .",
    "schweizer and coworkers developed an integral equation description of block copolymer melts that formally recovers the scaling behaviors obtained in field theories with only small differences @xcite . in this case , however , the stabilization of the disordered state close to the mst is of enthalpic origin .",
    "moreover , since the theory does not enforce incompressibility as a starting point in the treatment , the resulting structure factor contains contributions from both density and concentration fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with the physical picture that in block copolymer melts far from their mst , the concentration fluctuation contribution is negligible while density fluctuations can still occur .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt an integral equation approach to describe the block copolymer structure at the monomer level , extending schweizer s theory .",
    "this liquid - state description is largely compatible with the fluctuation - corrected mean - field approach , and has the advantage of providing a theoretical framework that is formally consistent with the procedure presented in the previous section . in this way ,",

    "realistic diblock copolymer systems can be mapped onto this simplified model , which has been extensively investigated in the past @xcite . in the theoretical coarse - graining approach",
    "presented here , the different chemical nature of the two blocks is accounted for by the difference in their radii of gyration , which is a function of the polymer local flexibility .",
    "this assumption is well justified in our approach since the monomeric structure is averaged out by the coarse - graining procedure , while local flexibility enters through the block radii of gyration .    as a starting point in our derivation , we focus on the monomeric quantities which are input to our coarse - grained description for a diblock copolymer system , eqs .",

    "on the other hand , there is an emergence of entropic packing effects arising from the difference in block sizes , yielding a response in @xmath203 where @xmath290 contacts are favored ( @xmath316 at high temperature for @xmath317 ) .",
    "this effect is quite apparent in the block frame of reference , which is sensitive to local microdomain scale correlations .",

    "for compositionally asymmetric diblock copolymers , physical clustering occurs around the minority species , and the minimum is slightly shifted toward the small-@xmath323 region . in both cases ,",

    "analytical expressions for the total correlation functions of the coarse - grained diblock for a copolymer chain represented as a gaussian thread of vanishing thickness , with an interaction symmetric potential acting between blocks of like and unlike chemical species , are derived . in the framework of this model ,",
    "the analytical total correlation functions contain contributions from density and concentration fluctuations .",
    "the concentration fluctuation terms increase in intensity as the diblock melt approaches its microscopic separation transition , however these do not diverge since finite - size fluctuations suppress the second - order phase transition .",
    "the contribution from concentration fluctuations drives the isotropic clustering of like species as the system approaches its phase transition . in the athermal regime ,",
