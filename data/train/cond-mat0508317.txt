    "the tree that emerges in generation @xmath6 has two hubs ( the nodes of highest degree ) of degree @xmath7 .",
    "an alternative way for constructing the tree consists of doubling the degree of each existing node , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , by attaching to it @xmath8 single - degree nodes ( fig .",
    "[ trees]c ) . yet",
    "a third method , which highlights the self - similarity of the tree , consists of producing @xmath1 replicas of generation @xmath6 and joining them at the hubs ( fig .  [ trees]d ) .     of the tree .",

    "( d )  third method : to obtain generation @xmath10 , join three copies of generation @xmath6 at the hubs ( the nodes of highest degree ) . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is clear that all nodes have degrees that are powers of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the number of nodes of degree @xmath13 in generation @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the total number of nodes ( the order ) in generation @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the number of links ( the size ) in generation @xmath6 .",
    "we have , @xmath16 ( seen most easily by the first method of construction ) , from which follows that @xmath17 since the graph is a tree , @xmath18 also , @xmath19 leading to @xmath20 this corresponds to a scale - free degree distribution of degree exponent @xmath21 .",
    "let us now explore the consequences of asynchronous , or random sequential updating , and how it differs from synchronous updating .",
    "based on the first method of construction ( fig .",
    "[ trees]b ) , at each time step , @xmath22 , we choose a link , randomly , and connect a new node to each of its endpoints .",
    "we intend to show that the differences between synchronous and sequential updating arise because of biases in the selection rule of the link to be updated . to this end",
    "we consider the following two rules : ( a )  select one of the @xmath23 links in the net , randomly , with equal probability , or ( b )  select a node ( among the @xmath24 nodes of the net ) , randomly , then select one of its neighbors , at random , and pick the link that connects the two nodes .",
    "a detailed analysis of these two rules and how they differ in the selection of specific links is given in appendix  [ howtopick ] .",
    "consider how the degree of node @xmath25 , @xmath26 , changes with time , by method ( a ) . since each of the @xmath27 links leading to node @xmath25 is selected with probability @xmath28 , the probability that @xmath29 in the next time step is @xmath30 . at each time step",
    "we add two links to the tree , so @xmath31 ( we begin with a single link at time step @xmath32 ) .",
    "hence , in the long time asymptotic limit changes in @xmath27 are given by @xmath33 the initial condition for this equation is @xmath34 , that is , we assume that the node was introduced to the tree at time @xmath35 as a node of degree one ( like all newly introduced nodes ) .",
    "the solution is then @xmath36 it follows from ( [ ki ] ) that the probability that @xmath27 is larger than @xmath8 , is @xmath37 however , since node @xmath25 could be introduced in any of the @xmath22 steps with equal probability , the probability that @xmath38 is @xmath39 , so that @xmath40 .",
    "the degree distribution for large @xmath8 then follows : @xmath41 we conclude that the random sequential construction of the tree by method  ( a ) leads to a scale - free degree distribution of degree exponent @xmath3 , different from @xmath2 of the deterministic tree .",
    "but what if we select the links by method  ( b ) ? in this case node @xmath25 may be the first of the two nodes to be selected in step @xmath22",
    ". this may happen with probability @xmath42 .",
    "node @xmath25 may also be the second node selected .",
    "the probability that we reach @xmath25 through a randomly selected node is @xmath43 .",
    "the degree of node @xmath25 increases from @xmath27 to @xmath44 regardless of whether it is picked first or second .",
    "that is , the rate of increase is @xmath45 .",
    "but @xmath46 , while @xmath47 , as @xmath48 . it follows that in the long time asymptotic limit @xmath49 from here we proceed exactly as for method  ( a ) , this time obtaining @xmath50 for large @xmath8 .",
    "once again the degree distribution is scale - free .",
    "the degree exponent @xmath51 is not only different from that of the deterministic tree but also differs from @xmath3 obtained by method  ( a ) .    ) , or",
    "by picking the link between a randomly selected node and a neighbor ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the trees consist of @xmath53 nodes .",

    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ pk ] we show the degree distribution of random sequential trees constructed by the two methods .",
    "the simulation data are consistent with the degree exponents predicted above , though one could argue that larger simulations are needed for the distributions to converge to their long time asymptotic limit  @xcite . at any rate ,",
    "the simulations demonstrate our point that a bias in the selection of the updated units is responsible for the differences between different kinds of random sequential nets , and between random sequential nets and synchronous nets .",
    "the differences from the deterministic tree , in our case , result from the fact that picking links at random ( by either of the two methods considered here ) favors links with endpoints of higher degree .",
    "a third method for building the random sequential tree is based on the recursive technique of fig .",
    "[ trees]c , where at each iteration the degree of all existing nodes is doubled by attaching to them new nodes of degree one . in the random sequential version the degree of only one randomly selected node is doubled at each time step .",
    "the node to be updated is picked with equal probability from among the @xmath24 nodes of the net .",
    "we now show that a random net constructed by this method achieves the same degree exponent as the deterministic net .",
    "we can not resort to the same technique employed for the previous two random sequential constructs because now @xmath54 in a single step , and the increase is too large to allow for a continuous approximation ( we are trying to study @xmath27 large ) .",
    "instead , we resort to discrete rate equations .",
    "the degrees in the random tree are powers of 2 , just as in the deterministic tree .",
    "let @xmath55 be the number of nodes of degree @xmath13 at time @xmath22 , and let @xmath56 be the order of the tree , then @xmath57 the long time asymptotic limit can be obtained by making the ansatz : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as @xmath48 ( @xmath60 ) . substituting in the first of eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , we learn that @xmath61 , leading to @xmath62 .",
    "the second equation tells us that @xmath63 , and the remaining @xmath64 is obtained from the constraint @xmath65 .",
    "we get @xmath66 this is essentially the same distribution as  ( [ eq5 ] ) , corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "this shows that there exist ways of choosing the units to be updated such that the differences between random sequential nets and deterministic nets are minimal .",
    "an interesting question concerns the differences between the deterministic and random scale - free nets , even when the random construction is unbiased .",
    "it is evident , from our last example , that differences do exist .",
    "for instance , in the deterministic tree there are exactly two hubs ( the highest degree nodes ) , always connected to one another .",
    "this need not be the case in the corresponding random tree . more generally , let @xmath67 be the number of links with endpoints of degree @xmath68 , @xmath69 for generation @xmath6 of the deterministic tree . then @xmath70 leading to @xmath71 this can be compared to @xmath72 of random trees of an equivalent size ( fig .  [ correlations ] ) .",
    "the differences seem to be trivial , leaving us with the question whether significant discrepancies show with respect to any other measure of structure .     as a function of @xmath73 for deterministic trees of generation @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , compared to random trees of equal size ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the random results were obtained as an average over 1000 realizations .",
    "error bars are smaller than the size of the symbols . ,",

    "how does one pick a link at random ?",
    "we focus on the following two methods : ( a )  select a link at random from among all the links in the network , with equal probabilities , or ( b )  select a node at random , then select a neighbor of that node at random , and pick the link connecting the two nodes .",
    "the two methods select specific links with generically different probabilities .",
    "consider a particular link , in a graph of order @xmath76 and size @xmath77 , whose endpoints are nodes of degree @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in method ( a )",
    "each of the @xmath77 links in the graph is selected with equal probability , so the link under consideration is selected with probability @xmath80 in method ( b ) , the probability to pick the node of degree @xmath78 first , is @xmath81 .",
    "then the probability that the right neighbor is selected , is @xmath82 .",
    "likewise , the probability to select the node of degree @xmath79 first is @xmath81 , and the remaining node is selected with probability @xmath83 .",
    "it follows that the probability to hit upon the specified link by random selection of the nodes at its endpoints is @xmath84 since @xmath85 , the average degree of nodes in the graph , it follows that @xmath86 note that this relation is valid for all connected graphs , regardless of structural details .",
    "an example relevant to our paper is a tree graph , where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 if the tree is large . in this case",
    "we deduce from  ( [ p / p ] ) that only links with @xmath89 are equally likely to be picked by either method .",
    "method  ( b ) favors links with @xmath90 . on the other hand ,",
    "all the tree leaves ( links leading to a node of degree one ) are selected more frequently by method  ( a ) .",
    "see , for example : b. chopard and m. droz , _ cellular automata modeling of physical systems _ , ( cambridge university press , 1998 ) ; n. rajewsky , l. santen , a. schadschneider , and m. schreckenberg , j. stat .",

    "smaller simulations of nets with a few thousand nodes fail to reveal convincing differences between the two methods and the degree exponent seems then consistent with that of the deterministic tree .",
    "note that even with @xmath53 nodes the largest degree in the nets are only about 100 ( method b ) and 300 ( a ) ."
