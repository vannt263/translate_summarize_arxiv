    "it is now accepted that financial markets are not governed solely by rational behavior of investors , as captured by the efficient market hypothesis .",
    "their decisions are also influenced by their subjective beliefs and expectations , and by the information from the internet .",
    "online news and social media provide large amounts of data , from which potentially useful information can be extracted .",
    "we are interested in collective opinion and expectations of investors in relation to financial markets .",
    "we analyze social media data from the twitter micro - blogging platform in terms of the attention to the most important events , and the collective expectations about the market moves .",
    "twitter is becoming an increasingly popular platform used to monitor and forecast financial markets .",
    "the first to show a clear relation between the twitter mood indicators and dow jones industrial average ( djia ) were bollen et al . @xcite . in general ,",
    "related work provides mixed conclusions about the relation between twitter and stock markets .",
    "the results depend on the type of analyses performed and whether the individual stocks or aggregate indices are considered .",
    "the range of the methodologies for analyzing the relations consists of the granger causality @xcite , one - step ahead forecasting analyses @xcite , information theoretic approaches @xcite , and event studies @xcite . on the one hand , granger causality and",
    "the information theoretic approaches analyze time series over a longer time period .",
    "they provide results about the existence of a quasi - causal relation between the social media and stock market .",
    "they do not identify precise time periods when this relation is stronger , weaker , or non - existent .",
    "event studies , on the other hand , focus on the relations in specific time intervals , thus providing potentially more actionable evidence for trading purposes .",
    "several papers analyze the relation between twitter and stock market for the aggregated indices only , e.g. , djia @xcite or s&p 500 @xcite . only a few provide conclusions regarding the relation between the twitter posts and stocks of individual companies , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the main reason is the typically insufficient number of twitter posts about individual companies to draw statistically significant results .",
    "we overcome this limitation by focusing on the most interesting time periods of an individual company , the quarterly earnings announcements ( ea ) .",
    "it turns out that the volume of twitter posts around most of the eas is substantially higher and allows to draw statistically significant conclusions .",
    "this type of analysis is enabled by the `` event study '' methodology @xcite , used in economics and finance .",
    "the event study has been often used to verify if the content of eas conveys useful information for the valuation of companies .",
    "it allows to draw conclusions about the price movement of a stock on average , over several different events of the same type . in related work in economics",
    ", the event study typically uses the earnings surprise , i.e. , the difference between the expectations of financial analysts and the reported valuation of a company in its earnings report . in our work , however , we test if the aggregate sentiment expressed in financial tweets around the eas indicates the direction of the stock price movement .",
    "there have been applications of the event study methodology to twitter data already .",
    "we are aware of three recent works which analyze the twitter sentiment data in relation to the stock price movement .",
    "sprenger et al .",
    "@xcite analyze both , known ea events as well as other , unexpected events .",
    "they conclude that both the sentiment and the type of the news can explain the market reaction ( movement of the stock price ) . our previous work by ranco et al .",
    "@xcite presents evidence of significant dependence between stock price returns and twitter sentiment in tweets about the companies .",
    "ranco et al .",
    "apply an event detection procedure to detect events from the twitter data .",
    "they report that most of the ea events have a corresponding peak in the twitter volume .",
    "this fact is the main motivation for the current work , where we focus on and perform an in - depth analysis of the ea events .",
    "there are several improvements over our previous work @xcite . in this study",
    "we analyze data over a longer period of three years .",
    "there are over 4.5 mio tweets labeled with sentiment , one of the largest datasets available .",
    "we provide and analyze twitter data at hourly resolution , which enables fine - tuned aggregation of tweets at the daily resolution .",
    "instead of analyzing events detected from the twitter stream , we focus only on the ea events , which are known in advance .",
    "we observe important differences between the timings of the ea events , either before the market opens , or after the market closes .",
    "it turns out that it is crucial to appropriately aggregate the tweets at daily resolution and align them with the market activities .",
    "finally , we use a different , formally sound , sentiment measure than the one used by ranco et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are several works in the financial literature , dealing with eas and their timings , related to our work .",
    "berkman et al .",
    "@xcite observe that the proportion of eas , reported after the close of the market has increased in recent years .",
    "their main conclusion is that it is important to account for the after - hours announcements , when performing event studies .",
    "specifically , in the case of an after - hours announcement , the day 0 prices should be shifted to the next market day . in case that no shifting is performed , abnormal returns could be biased .",
    "doyle et al .",
    "@xcite find that typical companies consistently report either after the close of the market , or before the market opens .",
    "they conclude that more complex companies tend to announce after the market closes .",
    "they also find higher trading volume around the after close announcements , in comparison to the before open announcements  our study confirms the same observation .",
    "these two facts provide evidence for their hypothesis that reporting after the market closes allows for broader dissemination of the information contained in the announcements .",
    "schroff et al .",
    "@xcite analyze the collective actions of individual investors around eas .",
    "they find that individual investors take more risk and tend to overestimate the likelihood of positive events , while underestimating the likelihood of negative ones .",
    "this intense buying ( selling ) done by individual investors prior to eas is followed by significant positive ( negative ) abnormal returns after the events @xcite .    a recent work by alostad et al .",
    "@xcite is closely related to the event study applied here .",
    "they combine two types of complementary data : volume from twitter and sentiment from financial news .",
    "they conclude that it is useful to predict the direction of a stock move only when there is an abnormally high twitter volume . however , in contrast to the other event studies @xcite , they assign polarity of the events from the financial news instead of the tweets .",
    "this work makes several contributions to the analysis of relations between social media and stock market .",
    "first , we find significant relation between the twitter sentiment and ea returns on the days of the announcements , with cumulative abnormal returns around 24% .",
    "second , we observe important differences between different timings of the announcements .",
    "the announcements before the market opens show lower cumulative abnormal returns , in comparison to the announcements after the market closes .",
    "third , based on these results , we test a simple trading strategy with buy / hold / sell at the market close of the day prior to the ea .",
    "fourth , we compare the twitter sentiment to the earnings surprise , a measure frequently used in event studies .",
    "an important conclusion from these results is the requirement for a proper setup of event studies and other methods which investigate relations between twitter and stock market .",
    "it is important to take into account the exact timing of the events with respect to the market trading hours . the daily aggregation of the twitter data , and its alignment with the market data have an impact on the perceived predictive power of twitter . when analyzing the data at the daily resolution , one needs to attribute the twitter posts created after the market closes to the next trading day .",
    "in this section we provide details about the data used in the study .",
    "the data are about the 30 companies in the djia index , in the period of three years , from june 1 , 2013 , to june 3 , 2016 .",
    "the data consist of the earnings announcement ( ea ) events , the stock market data , and the twitter data .",
    "all the data are available at https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4036269 .",
    "the terminology and abbreviations used throughout the paper are in table [ tab : terminology ] .",
    ".*terminology and abbreviations used . * [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : thresholds ]    putting a threshold on a signal is always somehow arbitrary , and there is no systematic treatment of this issue in the event study @xcite . the justification for our approach , already used in @xcite , is that sentiment should be regarded in relative terms , in the context of related events .",
    "sentiment score has no absolute meaning , but provides just an ordering of events on the scale from @xmath0 ( negative ) to @xmath1 ( positive ) .",
    "the most straightforward choice is to distribute all the events uniformly between the three classes . in the closely related work by sprenger et al .",
    "@xcite , the authors use the percentage of positive tweets for a given day @xmath2 , to determine the event polarity .",
    "since they also report an excess of positive tweets , they use the median share of positive tweets as a threshold between the positive and negative events .",
    "the event study methodology was originaly defined in financial econometrics @xcite .",
    "the first adaptations and applications to social media data were reported by sprenger et al .",
    "@xcite and ranco et al .",
    "@xcite . in the current study , there are two differences with respect to our previous work @xcite : here we focus just on the events anticipated in advance ( i.e. , eas ) , and we use a shorter event window , compatible with the devised trading strategy .    in summary ,",
    "in the current event study we use an event window of 12 trading days , i.e. , one day before the ea event , and up to 10 days afterwards .",
    "we use an estimation window of 120 trading days , and a market model as the normal performance model , estimated with an ordinary least squares regression of the djia returns .",
    "an event study is based on the premise that in order to correctly capture the impact of an event , a measure of abnormal price return must be defined .",
    "this measure is the actual price return minus the normal return of the stock during the event window . for company @xmath3 and event date",
    "@xmath2 the abnormal return is : @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 $ ] are the abnormal , actual , and expected normal returns , respectively . the normal performance model used in this work is the market model : it assumes a linear relation between the overall market return and the return of the stock .",
    "more details are given in @xcite .    in order to draw overall conclusions for the set of events",
    "being analyzed , the abnormal return observations must be first aggregated .",
    "the aggregation is performed through time and across stocks . by aggregating across all the stocks ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath8 the cumulative abnormal return ( @xmath9 ) from time @xmath10 to @xmath11 is the sum of the abnormal returns : @xmath12    for the calculation of the @xmath9 variance , we assume that @xmath13 ( shown in @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total number of events .",
    "finally , we introduce the test statistic @xmath16 .",
    "this quantity is used to assess whether the impact of the external event on the cumulative abnormal returns is significant .",
    "the test statistic is defined as : @xmath17{var(car(\\tau_1,\\tau_2 ) ) } } = \\hat{\\theta } \\thicksim \\mathcal{n}(0,1)\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the time index inside the event window , and @xmath19 is the total length of the event window .",
