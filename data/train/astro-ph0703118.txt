    "our knowledge of the jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) becomes less certain as we consider regions closer to the central engine .",
    "however , these regions are the sites of especially interesting physical phenomena , such as acceleration and collimation of the jet flow , formation of the observed `` core '' of the jet , energization of relativistic electrons , and changes in the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "while it is widely accepted that synchrotron emission is the main mechanism behind continuum production , establishing the location of this emission at different wavebands has been problematic .",
    "imaging with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) can resolve different components of the jet at radio wavelengths .",
    "in addition , variability of the flux density and spectral shape provides information on the small - scale behavior at all wavebands , but the inability to produce high quality images at submilliarcsecond resolution at wavelengths shorter than 3 mm allows multiple interpretations that are compatible with the data .",
    "there is , however , an emerging method for establishing the location of the emission at short wavelengths . similarities of unique polarization signatures of features in both vlbi images and optical measurements provide a possible connection between the two wavebands .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite , that extend earlier studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , reveals a correlation between vlbi pseudocore ( see below ) and optical polarization angle in a number of blazars .",
    "these results suggest that the two emission regions are either cospatial or separate but with both threaded by magnetic fields having similar geometries .",
    "[ here we follow @xcite , in referring to the compact feature at the upstream end of the jet in vlbi images as the `` pseudocore ''",
    ". this may be an actual stationary feature , such as a standing shock wave ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the point in the diverging jet flow where the optical depth is of order unity @xcite .",
    "]    the most direct way to establish cospatiality of the emission at different wavebands is to observe coordinated variability of polarization that is seen both in the vlbi images and in measurements at shorter wavelengths . in this _",
    "letter _ we report observations of polarization variations in both the optical emission and the pseudocore as measured on 43 ghz very long baseline array ( vlba ) images of the quasar pks  0420@xmath0014 ( @xmath3 ; @xcite @xcite ) that span nine days , with no significant time lag .",
    "these results place the nonthermal optical emission within the 7 mm pseudocore of the jet .",
    "we collected optical data at two sites . at the steward observatory 1.55 m kuiper telescope , we used the spol spectropolarimeter @xcite , making a total of nine measurements from 2005 october 23 to november 3 .",
    "a 600 lines / mm grating covered an entire diffraction order of @xmath4 - 800 nm at a resolution of 1.7 nm .",
    "the spectropolarimetry used slit widths of either @xmath5 or @xmath6 along with a @xmath7 spectral extraction aperture .",
    "differential spectrophotometry relative to field stars calibrated by @xcite employed a @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) aperture .",
    "details of the reduction procedure can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we also performed polarimetry and photometry at @xmath10 band on the azt-8 70 cm telescope at the crimean astrophysical observatory .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was low , however , owing to the faintness of 0420@xmath0014 ( @xmath10 = 17.8 - 18.3 ) during the campaign .",
    "we therefore do not display the data here , but note that they are consistent with the steward observatory results .",
    "we observed 0420@xmath0014 at 43 ghz with the vlba at four epochs during the campaign : october 24 , 28 and november 1 , 2 .",
    "after correlation at the array operations center of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) in socorro , new mexico , we followed the procedures described in @xcite to create and analyze the resultant images .",
    "we refer the polarization position angle measurements to a stable feature in the vlba polarized intensity image of the quasar cta102 .",
    "we find good agreement between the adjusted angles of several objects with archival data and with contemporaneous very large array measurements ( available on website http://www.vla.nrao.edu/astro/calib/polar/ ) . in our analysis , we add @xmath11 to the polarization angle in the pseudocore of 0420@xmath0014 to compensate for faraday rotation , based on the estimate of rotation measure by @xcite .",
    "we also observed 0420@xmath0014 at two epochs ( october 24 and 27 ) with the heterodyne spectrometer at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at a frequency of 230 ghz .",
    "the sensitivity of the system was sufficient only to determine the flux density of 0420@xmath0014 relative to the planets uranus and mars .",
    "on milliarcsecond ( mas ) scales , the 43 ghz structure of 0420@xmath0014 consists of a compact pseudocore and a jet with knots that propagate away from the pseudocore on paths that eventually curve southward @xcite .",
    "the vlba images from our campaign ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) feature a broad jet extending to 0.7 mas south of the pseudocore .",
    "the pseudocore , with a flux density of @xmath12 jy , has a low degree of polarization , @xmath13 , but a highly variable evpa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the first distinct jet component , a 0.45 jy knot lying 0.4 mas south of the pseudocore , is more highly polarized ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "its degree and angle of polarization remained steady throughout the campaign to within the uncertainties ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , providing a check on the calibration .",
    "the very low polarization of the pseudocore at the third epoch of vlba data ( julian date 2453675.9 ) is an artifact of the long observation time ( @xmath15 hours ) required to obtain a high - quality image . upon splitting the observation in two ,",
    "we find that the evpa varied by @xmath16 from the first half to the second half of the observation , thereby cancelling the polarization in the resultant image shown in figure [ fig1 ] . the degree of polarization of the pseudocore displayed in figure [ fig2 ] for this epoch is the average between the two halves . for the remaining vlba images ,",
    "the evpa did not change by more than @xmath17 between the first and second half of the observation .",
    "the optical polarization underwent pronounced variations in both @xmath18 and evpa , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "of particular note is that the 43 ghz pseudocore and optical evpas varied in a similar manner , following each other remarkably well over a range of @xmath19 . by eye",
    ", we see that a straight line through the three radio points ( the polarization of the pseudocore was too weak to measure on november 1 ) provides a reasonable representation of the overall optical trend . upon performing a least - squares linear fit to the evpa vs. time plots that takes into account the uncertainties in the data , we find that the pseudocore polarization vector rotates by @xmath20 day@xmath21 , while the optical vector rotates by @xmath22 day@xmath21 .",
    "there is no significant time lag between the 43 ghz and optical polarization variations . despite the similarity in evpa at the two wavebands ,",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath18 is considerably higher ( @xmath23% ) at the optical band than in the 7 mm pseudocore ( @xmath24% ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath25 of the 43 ghz emission from the pseudocore arises from a separate , essentially unpolarized region that is blended with the pseudocore at the angular resolution of the vlba .",
    "we suggest that this region is optically thick with a tangled magnetic field , in which case the polarization would be very close to zero . a higher resolution 86 ghz polarized intensity image should reveal this component .",
    "the striking correspondence between variations in polarization at the two wavebands locates the primary site of optical nonthermal emission in this quasar within the 7 mm pseudocore . as emphasized by @xcite ,",
    "this generally lies well downstream of the central engine and `` true core , '' since the self - absorption turnover frequency of the overall synchrotron spectrum of 0420@xmath0014 occurs at a shorter wavelength , @xmath26 mm @xcite .",
    "our flux density measurements of 2.5 jy at 7 mm and 1.1 jy at 1.35 mm during the campaign indeed indicate that the turnover was at a wavelength longer than 1.35 mm",
    ". the true core might be the end of the bulk acceleration and collimation zone ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) beyond which the jet is conical with essentially constant mean flow lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "magnetic turbulence is the most straightforward way to explain the low fractional polarization generally observed in the compact jets of quasars at radio wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we approximate the turbulence as @xmath27 cells of equal volume , each with uniform but randomly oriented magnetic field .",
    "the randomness dilutes most of the polarization of the source such that the mean degree of polarization @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the maximum linear polarization of incoherent synchrotron radiation and @xmath30 is the spectral index of the total flux density spectrum , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation about the mean value @xmath32 .",
    "the mean fractional optical polarization of @xmath33 then implies that @xmath34 cells participate in the synchrotron radiation at this waveband .",
    "the polarization of the pseudocore could vary if there were a changeover in turbulent cells involved in the emission during the course of our campaign .",
    "this can be accomplished if the radiating electrons are energized by a shock wave that passes through the turbulence @xcite or vice versa .",
    "however , only in the unlikely case of a face - on propagating shock wave would the partial ordering of the magnetic field parallel to the shock front not be apparent from the observer s perspective ; otherwise , the compression would affect the polarization by establishing a preferred evpa ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , electrons accelerated at a shock front lose energy as they advect away from the front , with those that attain higher energies  and therefore emit at higher frequencies  having shorter radiative lifetimes .",
    "this should cause the optical emission to occupy a much smaller volume ( @xmath35 ) than does the mm - wave emission @xcite , so that the latter should involve @xmath36 cells , or @xmath37 times as many as at optical wavelengths .",
    "although this is roughly compatible with the lower mean polarization at 7 mm , it can not explain the similarity in evpa in the two wavebands , since the additional factor of @xmath37 cells should produce a mean polarization angle at 7 mm that is essentially independent of the optical evpa .    in order for a shock plus turbulence model to be valid ,",
    "the thickness of the section of shocked plasma imposed by gas dynamics ( the shocked region ends at a rarefaction ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must be comparable to the radiative lifetime of the optically emitting electrons times the speed at which the compressed plasma drifts from the acceleration zone at the shock front .",
    "the timescale of variability of the optical polarization @xmath38 days ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if we adopt the apparent speed and angle to the line of sight of the jet in 0420@xmath0014 derived from vlba monitoring by @xcite , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( doppler factor of 16 and flow lorentz factor @xmath41 ) , a section of jet plasma of thickness @xmath42 pc passes by a stationary shock during a time interval of 4 days in the observer s reference frame .",
    "the synchrotron radiative lifetime of the electrons at optical wavelengths @xmath43/0.1",
    "g)@xmath44 yr , where we estimate the magnetic field @xmath45 g by calculating the value corresponding to equipartition between the magnetic and relativistic electron energy densities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for evidence that the brightness temperatures of pseudocores of blazars are consistent with equipartition ) .",
    "the energized electrons travel a distance @xmath46 pc before they can no longer radiate in the optical band ( the @xmath47 factor accounts for lorentz contraction of the jet length in the plasma frame ) .",
    "this is essentially the same as the value of @xmath48 estimated above , so that nearly all of the turbulent cells in the emission region are replaced every 4 days , as required by the variability .",
    "the length of the section compressed by the shock can be less than the distance traversed by the electrons radiating at optical wavelengths if the shock results from the body pinch - mode instability owing to an oscillating pressure mismatch at the boundary between the jet and the external medium @xcite .",
    "as seen in numerical gas dynamical simulations @xcite , such shocks have a conical geometry if the jet is sufficiently close to being circularly symmetric .",
    "the partial ordering of the magnetic field owing to compression by a conical shock contributes negligibly to the polarization for very small viewing angles @xcite such as @xmath49 , the value derived for 0420@xmath0014 by @xcite .",
    "the apparent rotation of the polarization vector can be purely stochastic , as found by @xcite , who analyzed a model similar to that described above .",
    "we have performed a number of simulations similar to those of jones et al . , incorporating 600 cells , each with the same density and strength of a randomly oriented magnetic field .",
    "the simulations produce artificial plots of percent polarization and evpa vs. time .",
    "rotations by @xmath50 or more occur @xmath51 of the time .",
    "since 0420@xmath0014 was only one of 13 objects observed , the probability of catching one source at the start of a long rotation episode is reasonably high if nearly all blazars behave in a similar manner .",
    "our observations could also be explained if a feature , e.g. , a shock , with a partially ordered magnetic field were to translate down a jet that twists by @xmath52 over the length of @xmath53 pc that the feature would move in 11 days ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is not implausible , since curved jets are common in 43 ghz images of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , such a model does not naturally explain the variations in degree of polarization and the fluctuations in evpa about the rotation trend ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a similar criticism argues against apparent rotation from changing aberration owing to acceleration of a polarized knot as it propagates down the jet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , monthly vlba monitoring throughout 2006 failed to detect any bright knot propagating down the jet that would correspond to a shock wave moving through the pseudocore during our campaign .",
    "we can also eliminate a simple two - component model in which two nearly orthogonally polarized regions vary in relative flux density such that the evpa rotates from that of one feature to that of the other . the maximum rotation possible in such a model is less than @xmath54 , while the optical evpa changed by considerably more than @xmath50 during the 11 nights of our campaign ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "our observation of concurrent polarization position angle at optical wavelengths and 7 mm as it swings by @xmath19 over an interval of nine days demonstrates that the main region producing polarized optical emission is the same as that giving rise to the pseudocore at 43 ghz . during this rotation ,",
    "the degree of polarization varied and the evpa fluctuated about the mean trend in a manner consistent with a chaotic magnetic field .",
    "we propose a model that explains the variations via changeovers in the @xmath34 turbulent cells involved in the emission over a period of a few days .",
    "this is accomplished as the plasma advects through a standing , conical shock where electrons are accelerated at the front .",
    "the polarized emission at 43 ghz must originate in the same volume as does the optical radiation , a situation that requires the region compressed by the shock to be limited by gas dynamics rather than by radiative energy losses .",
    "this agrees with gas dynamical simulations that show alternating regions of conical shocks and rarefactions in jets with circular symmetry @xcite . we therefore conclude that the 43 ghz pseudocore in 0420@xmath0014 corresponds to a standing shock system rather than the site where the optical depth is roughly unity .",
    "this is likely to be the case in many blazars , since stationary features near the pseudocore in parsec - scale jets are common @xcite .",
    "we are in the process of analyzing data from other objects observed during the campaign as well as objects from a similar campaign in 2006 march - april .",
    "these data will determine how frequently rapid , correlated variations in optical and high - frequency radio evpas occur in blazars .",
    "if this behavior is common , then we can search for similarity in polarization in a number of blazars to identify the locations of optical synchrotron emission on vlbi images .",
    "this would allow us to use correlations between optical or mm - wave and x - ray as well as @xmath55-ray variations in total flux density to determine the location(s ) of nonthermal emission across a factor of @xmath56 in frequency @xcite .",
