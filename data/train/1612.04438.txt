    "stellar atmospheres are the outer gaseous layers of stars and are the locus of a broad domain of physical phenomena such as shock waves , winds , flares , coronal mass ejections and magnetic reconnection @xcite",
    ". the accurate prediction of the behavior of stellar atmospheres is challenging for a variety of reasons .",
    "first , stellar atmospheres are dynamical objects whose state is continuously changing with time .",
    "this was recognized since the early days of observations from the asymmetric profiles of atomic lines in observed spectra , which revealed the existence of massive gas motions @xcite .",
    "second , the low values of pressure and density are such that collisional rates among gas particles ( _ e.g. _ atoms , molecules , free - electrons ) are not sufficient to ensure local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( lte ) @xcite .",
    "a further , and major , complexity comes from energy transfer by radiation , which plays a dominant role .",
    "radiative transfer introduces a global coupling between the stellar material at all points in the atmosphere .    within the context of a fluid description",
    ", the modeling of stellar atmospheres should be attacked from the governing equations of radiation hydrodynamics . under conditions where non - lte ( nlte ) prevails and relativistic effects",
    "can be ignored , these equations comprise : the continuity equations for each gaseous species , the global momentum and energy equations , and the radiative transfer equation ( _ i.e. _ kinetic equation for photons ) @xcite . in the most accurate formulation , each bound state of atomic and molecular components is treated as a separate _ pseudo - species _ to allow for departures from equilibrium ( _ i.e. _ maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) .",
    "this approach is sometimes referred to as state - to - state ( sts ) approach @xcite .",
    "the radiation field is treated based on a line - by - line method with the purpose of capturing the finest details of radiative processes leading to line and continuous spectra .",
    "it is immediately clear that this accurate modeling strategy , despite its use , with substantial simplifications , in one - dimensional situations @xcite , becomes unfeasible when moving to multi - dimensional configurations and when accounting for all possible opacity sources , not to mention the coupling with electro - magnetic fields .",
    "the present work is the first step of a long - term effort aimed at developing reduced - order models for astrophysical plasmas , with the final goal of enabling accurate predictions in unsteady nlte multi - dimensional simulations . in this paper",
    "a self - consistent and systematic method to reduce the complexity of the nlte collisional - radiative kinetics is proposed .",
    "the formulation is based on the general maximum entropy principle framework recently developed by @xcite , which has already been applied with success to the study of collisional excitation , dissociation and ionization in atomic and molecular gases @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the set of sts governing equations for a two - temperature plasma , where the mass and energy source terms due to collisional and radiative processes are obtained self - consistently from the boltzmann equation ( _ i.e. _ kinetic equation for gas particles ) @xcite .",
    "kinetic and thermodynamic data are taken from the most recent and accurate _ ab - initio _ calculations and/or experiments .",
    "the complexity reduction of the nlte kinetic mechanism is achieved by lumping the bound energy states in groups .",
    "different grouping strategies are investigated , such as uniform and maxwell - boltzmann .",
    "the reduced set of governing equations are obtained by taking moments with respect to internal energy of the sts governing equations .",
    "the grouping is not applied , for the moment , to the radiative transfer problem which is still treated in a line - by - line fashion .",
    "applications consider the steady flow across radiative shock waves in partially ionized hydrogen .",
    "hydrogen was selected as it represents the most abundant element in stellar atmospheres and the inter - stellar medium @xcite .",
    "a standing shock was chosen as testcase since : i ) its numerical calculation requires much less computational time compared to time - dependent simulations @xcite , and ii ) shock waves are common in astrophysical flows and play important roles , for instance , in pulsating stars , accretion disks and the chromosphere of the sun @xcite .",
    "hence , their accurate prediction is of great interest , especially for comparison with observations . at the same time , if a reduced - order model already performs poorly when applied to a standing shock , it is almost certain that the same situation ( if not worse ) will occur under time - dependent conditions .",
    "radiative shock waves have been investigated for a long time ( and still are ) and were among the first fluid mechanical benchmarks to be studied based on the methods of nlte radiation hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "some examples are : the early works by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , clarke and coworkers ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , and the more recent papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . within the context of the inviscid flow approximation ,",
    "the structure of a radiative shock wave in an atomic plasma can be , in general , subdivided in three distinct regions : i ) a radiative precursor ahead of the gasdynamic _ jump _ , ii ) an internal relaxation region behind the shock dominated by collisional excitation and ionization , and iii ) a radiative relaxation ( or cooling ) region where the temperature decreases due to optically thin radiation produced , for instance , by radiative recombination .",
    "the radiative precursor can be further divided in : i ) far precursor and ii ) near precursor @xcite . in the former non - equilibrium excitation",
    "may occur due to absorption of resonant radiation in atomic line wings .",
    "the latter is characterized instead by photo - ionization from the ground - state ( _ e.g. _ lyman continuum ) by photons emitted in the hot gas layers of the radiative cooling region which propagate upstream .",
    "the extent ( and also the existence ) of the aforementioned zones strongly depends on the shock velocity , and the gas pressure and temperature in the free - stream @xcite .",
