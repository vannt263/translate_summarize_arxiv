    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are nanoscale solid state structures that provide three - dimensional quantum confinement of otherwise mobile charge carriers .",
    "self - assembled qds of @xmath0 embedded in @xmath1 provide confinement for both electrons and holes in a direct band gap semiconductor .",
    "hence , they are optically active with the benefits of a high quantum efficiency and compatibility with existing semiconductor technology .",
    "these properties make the qds highly promising light sources for novel optical devices including optical quantum information devices @xcite . this has led to an increasing interest in the quantum - optical properties of qds , and major achievements include the demonstration of the purcell effect for qds in solid - state cavities @xcite and strong coupling between a single qd and the optical mode of a cavity @xcite .",
    "very recently also electrical tuning of such quantum photonics devices was demonstrated @xcite , which is a significant milestone towards practical all - solid state cavity quantum electrodynamics devices .    despite the recent progress , a thorough understanding of the dynamics of light - matter coupling for qds in nanostructured photonic media is still lacking .",
    "such an understanding is required for quantitative comparisons between experiment and theory .",
    "the problem is two - fold , i.e. a detailed understanding of both the optical part and the electronic part is required .",
    "the optical part is described by the local density of optical states ( ldos ) expressing the distribution of modes that the qd can radiate to , while the electronic part is determined by the exciton wavefunction for the qd . here",
    "we will investigate an optical system where the ldos can be calculated exactly , and use that to extract detailed information about the qd . our experimental results are compared to a theoretical qd model , and the effect of qd size , material composition , and strain is investigated .",
    "such quantitative comparisons of experimental data to simple theoretical qd models are much needed in order to assess the full potential of qds in nanostructured media for , e.g. , single - photon sources @xcite , low - threshold lasers @xcite , or spontaneous emission control @xcite .    when interpreting spontaneous emission decay curves from qds ,",
    "it is often implicitly assumed that the qds primarily decay through radiative recombination , while non - radiative processes are negligible .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption is not generally valid , and omnipresent non - radiative processes must be considered .",
    "only few experiments have addressed this issue .",
    "robert et al .",
    "established an upper bound on the contribution from nonradiative processes of 25% by measuring the ratio of the bi - exciton to exciton emission intensity at saturation @xcite .",
    "quantitative measurements of the radiative and non - radiative decay rates of qds were only carried out recently using a modified ldos both for colloidal qds @xcite and for self - assembled qds @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of the radiative decay rates are essential since nanophotonic devices rely on the ability to manipulate the radiative processes , while non - radiative recombination leads to loss in the system .",
    "as first pointed out by purcell @xcite the radiative decay rate of an emitter is modified inside a structured dielectric medium , which is due to the modification of the ldos . in early experiments by drexhage @xcite",
    ", this effect was experimentally demonstrated by positioning emitters in the proximity of a reflecting surface .",
    "we have recently employed the modified ldos near a semiconductor - air interface as a spectroscopic tool to extract radiative and non - radiative decay rates and from that infer the overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on the fact that the radiative decay rate is proportional to the ldos , while the non - radiative decay rate is unaffected . in the present paper we expand on our previous work in particular by comparing the measured radiative decay rate to theory , which requires a detailed model of the qd electron and hole wavefunctions .",
    "we have measured the radiative decay rate at different emission energies , which reveals the dependence of the qd optical properties on its size .",
    "we review the wigner - weisskopf theory of spontaneous emission from qds , predicting an exponential decay of the exciton population and the ldos is derived for the applied interface geometry using a green s function technique .",
    "we furthermore show that the radiative decay rate of a qd in a homogeneous medium is proportional to the square of the overlap between electron and hole wavefunctions and calculate the frequency dependence of this overlap using a simple two - band model of the qd .",
    "the qd model is discussed in details and compared to our experimental data employing realistic parameters as input to the theory .",
    "the pronounced size dependence of the electron - hole wavefunction overlap is found to originate from the differences in effective mass and binding energy of the electron and hole .",
    "furthermore , we investigate three different strain models for the qd and compare their predictions to experiment thereby providing valuable insight on the complex strain mechanisms of self - assembled qds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we present the experimental method and in section [ sec : measurements ] the experimental results . in section [ sec : theory ] we discuss the wigner - weisskopf model for spontaneous emission and derive the relation between the radiative decay rate , the ldos , and the wavefunction overlap . in section [ sec : numericalresults ] we combine the analytical expressions for the radiative rate with the numerical results for the wavefunction overlap and compare theory with experiment . finally , we present conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "[ figure2_ver17](a ) .",
    "the image contains detailed information about the geometry and height of the qds at the surface , but the topography of the surface is convolved with the afm tip shape function , and thus the width and exact geometry of the qds can not be extracted directly .",
    "the maximum height , however , is not subject to this effect and we used the afm data in fig .  [ figure2_ver17](a ) to obtain a histogram of the heights recorded for 100 randomly selected qds .",

    "we find an average aspect ratio defined as the height to lateral base diameter ratio of @xmath34 , but due to the convolution effect this is an upper bound . since the transition energy of a qd depends sensitively on its height , the height distribution function is central when testing theoretical models of the emission spectrum against experiments , as discussed in section [ sec : numericalresults ] .    from the afm data we found a qd density of 250 @xmath35 which corresponds to an average interdot distance of 60  @xmath18 .",
    "this number should be compared to typical length scales for various relevant qd interactions .",
    "carrier tunneling is negligible for distances beyond 15  @xmath18 @xcite and the dipole - dipole interaction is only significant for distances close to the frster radius , which is typically 2 - 9  @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "therefore the measurements performed here provide ensemble averaged values of single qd properties with the advantage of an excellent signal - to - noise ratio in the measurements .",
    "the wafer was processed by standard uv lithography and wet chemical etching in five subsequent steps with nominal etch depths of @xmath36  @xmath18 , @xmath37  @xmath18 , @xmath38  @xmath18 , @xmath39  @xmath18 , and @xmath40  @xmath18 by which we obtained 32 fields with specific distances from the qds to the semiconductor surface .",

    "the important parameter extracted from the fit is the fast decay rate , which is due to recombination of bright excitons in the qd , i.e. , it equals the total decay rate discussed in the previous section .",
    "we measured the decay curves for 32 nominally equidistantly spaced distances to the interface .",

    "the total decay rate in a homogeneous medium was extracted from fig .",
    "[ figure06_ver17 ] by the method outlined above and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure07_ver17](a ) . the total decay rate increases with increasing emission energy , which could suggest that the radiative rate increases with energy , as has been reported for colloidal qds @xcite .",
    "however , the opposite turns out to be true for self - assembled qds . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 is found to decrease with increasing energy , and the overall increase in the total rate is due to the pronounced increase in @xmath10 with emission energy .",
    "it should be stressed that such variations in the radiative rate can be assessed only because a modified ldos is employed allowing to separate radiative and non - radiative contributions .",
    "the striking energy dependence of the radiative rate can be explained as being due to the dependence of the electron and hole wavefunctions on the size of the qd , which will be discussed and analyzed in detail in section [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "here we want to stress some potential pitfalls in the interpretation of the frequency dependence of spontaneous emission decay rates from qds .",
    "as already pointed out , it is decisive to include the effects of non - radiative recombination and implement a technique that allows to separate it from radiative recombination .",
    "thus , an a priori assumption of negligible non - radiative recombination would erroneously lead to the conclusion that the radiative rate increases with energy .",
    "furthermore , when extracting quantitative data for the qd decay rates , one has to be aware of the possible influence of the presence of interfaces . in a homogeneous medium",

    "in this section , we give a theoretical description of the radiative decay of excitons in qds .",
    "for sufficiently small qds , the energy difference between bound states in the qds is much larger than the coulomb energy and the effect of the coulomb interaction on the internal exciton dynamics becomes negligible @xcite .",
    "this means that the electron and hole comprising the exciton may be considered independent , which is the strong confinement model .",
    "furthermore , we employ here a two - band description of the qd including the effects of a wetting layer and strain , which is sufficient to capture the essential properties of qds @xcite . our objective here is to explore the validity of this model by a thorough comparison to our measurements of the radiative decay rate and the emission spectrum , which is carried out in section [ sec : numericalresults ] .",
    "thorough explorations of even simple qd models are much needed since complete microscopically correct qd models are outside reach both due to the lack of experimental knowledge about exact atomic composition and computational complexity .",
    "spontaneous emission occurs due to the interaction of the exciton with the continuum of vacuum modes .",
    "a rigorous description of spontaneous emission requires a fully quantum description where both the radiation field and the exciton states in the qd are quantized .",

    "we conclude from this result that the measured height distribution of uncapped qds is _ not _ very useful in determining the actual confinement volume of the overgrown qds that the experiments are performed on .",
    "this is due to complex redistribution and intermixing processes of indium and gallium will occur during growth and subsequent regrowth @xcite , which are likely to modify the qd confinement potential and strain significantly .    thus abandoning at this point the interpretation of the measured height distribution , which is closely related to the emission spectrum , we focus on the electron - hole wavefunction overlap .",
    "keeping the aspect ratio fixed at a realistic value of @xmath167 and excluding for the moment the wetting layer , we obtain the overlap shown in fig .",

    "judging from experiments available in the literature @xcite both these values of @xmath69 are reasonable for overgrown qds , so there is no support for favoring one of the two surviving strain models . we are led to the conclusion that in particular shear strain is less significant for qds compared to quantum wells , although further microscopic details of qd composition and geometry would be required for a further investigation of these issues .",

    "is omitted , the aspect ratio is @xmath167 , and the indium mole fraction @xmath168 .",
    "we find that for wetting layer thicknesses below 4 monolayer ( ml ) the wavefunction overlap is only slightly modified in the emission energy range of interest to the experiment .",
    "for a very thick wetting layer ( 6 ml ) , the qd wavefunction is modified such that the monotonic decrease of the wavefunction overlap with energy observed for all other thicknesses does not apply .",
    "this behavior can be understood as follows : for very thick wetting layers and small qds a significant part of both the electron and hole wavefunctions are expelled from the qd giving rise to quantum well - like wetting layer states that can have an increased mutual overlap . for the qd sample of the experiment the wetting layer was on the order of 2 ml .",
    "the above discussions point to a number of subtleties associated with a quantitative comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "these are mainly related to lack of knowledge about intrinsic properties of the qds .",
    "notably , the monotonic decrease in the electron - hole wavefunction overlap with emission energy is found to be a very general and robust result for a large range of different parameters .",
    "the generality of this result can be understood in a simple physical picture and is related to the differences in the electron and heavy hole effective masses .",

    "the large qds emitting at small energies have a relatively large electron - hole wavefunction overlap . decreasing qd size ( i.e. increasing emission energy ) compresses the electron and hole wavefunctions , and",
    "since the quantum confinement effect influences the electron wavefunction more than the hole wavefunction , the wavefunction overlap is decreased .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure14_ver17 ] where the calculated electron and hole wavefunctions for two different qd sizes are plotted .",
    "it is clearly observed that a reduction in the qd height leads to a compression of the hole envelope wavefunction while the electron wavefunction extends further into the surrounding @xmath1 barrier .",
    "we have presented time - resolved measurements of spontaneous emission from self - assembled qds near a semiconductor - air interface .",
    "the interface leads to a modification of the ldos , which can be calculated in an exact model without any adjustable parameters .",
    "the excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables separating radiative and non - radiative decay rates whereby they can be determined with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "we reviewed the theory behind the experiment by calculating the spontaneous emission radiative decay rate in a full quantum model in which spontaneous emission is described by wigner - weisskopf theory .",
    "the radiative decay rate is proportional to the projected ldos , which was derived using a green s function formalism .    from our measurements of the radiative decay rate at different emission energies we extracted the frequency dependence of the overlap of the electron and hole envelope wavefunctions .",
    "the experimental data were compared to theory by solving numerically the schrdinger equation for a qd potential including the effects of shear and hydrostatic strain . from this model the spontaneous emission spectrum , which is inhomogeneously broadened due to the different sizes of qds making up the ensemble , and the electron - hole wavefunction overlap were derived .",
    "an attempt to model the emission spectrum using the qd height distribution obtained by afm on uncapped qds was unsuccessful leading to the conclusion that this height distribution does not properly reflect the microscopic confinement potential of overgrown qds .",
    "regarding the frequency dependence of the electron - hole wavefunction overlap , we found good agreement between experiment and theory with reasonable assumptions about qd size , geometry , strain , and wetting layer thickness assuming purely hydrostatic strain or no strain at all .",
    "in contrast , systematic deviations were found when including both shear and hydrostatic strain .",
    "although the numerical model employed here is too simple to reflect the microscopic details of the qd geometry such as , e.g. , indium - gallium intermixing , it reflects this simple physical picture very well .",
    "a more detailed comparison between experiment and theory is limited by the lack of experimental input on the qd structure at the atomic scale , which would be required to verify more sophisticated qd models .",
    "we finally discussed how the striking frequency dependence of the radiative decay rate , and consequently of the electron - hole wavefunction overlap , can be understood in terms of a very simple physical picture : the heavy hole wavefunction is more compressible than the electron wavefunction due to the larger effective mass .",
    "a reduction in the qd size therefore leads to a further localization of the heavy hole wavefunction , while the electron wavefunction delocalizes into the surrounding barrier .",
    "this leads to a decrease in wavefunction overlap for increasing emission energy .",

    "<S> the experimental results are compared to the quantum optics theory of a solid state emitter in an inhomogeneous environment . using this model </S>",
    "<S> , we extract the frequency dependence of the overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore discuss three models of quantum dot strain and compare the measured wavefunction overlap to these models . </S>",
    "<S> the observed frequency dependence of the wavefunction overlap can be understood qualitatively in terms of the different compressibility of electrons and holes originating from their different effective masses . </S>"
