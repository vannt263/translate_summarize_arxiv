    "the present work deals with skew products whose fibers are unit intervals .",

    "we focus on an important class of skew products , so - called _ step _ skew products , such that the fiber maps dependence on the base is piecewise constant , see def .",
    "[ d : step_and_mild ] .    in our main theorem",
    "we show that the dynamics of a generic step skew product with interval fibers can be described in relatively simple terms .",
    "this dynamics is in a sense similar to the cartesian product of the dynamics in the base and the dynamics of a single interval diffeomorphism . more precisely ( see thm .  [",
    "t : markov_classification ] ) , the phase space of such a skew product can be covered by finitely many absorbing and expelling strips .",
    "any absorbing strip contains a unique attractor ; any expelling strip contains a unique repeller .",
    "these attractors and repellers are _ bony graphs _ of maps from the base to the fiber : each of them intersects almost every fiber ( w.r.t . the markov measure in the base ) at a single point ; other fibers are intersected at intervals .",
    "this feature is similar to _ porcupine horseshoes _ discovered by daz and gelfert in  @xcite . in particular , we partially answer question 1.6 from  @xcite by showing that generically , the set of bones is meager .",
    "almost every point of the phase space ( w.r.t . the _ standard measure _ which is the product of the markov measure in the base and lebesgue measure in the fiber , sf . def .",
    "[ d : std ] ) tends to one of the attractor graphs .",
    "when the time is reversed , almost every point either tends to one of the repeller graphs , or is eventually taken to a domain where the inverse map is not defined .    finally , the closure of each attractor graph and of each repeller graph is the support of an ergodic invariant measure that projects to the markov measure in the base .",
    "the attractor measures are srb - measures ; their basins of attraction contain subsets of full standard measure in the corresponding strips .",
    "the fiberwise lyapunov exponents of the attracting and the repelling measures are strictly negative and strictly positive , respectively .    in  @xcite",
    ", kudryashov has recently constructed a robust example of a step skew product with interval fibers such that its attractor intersects some fibers at intervals ( instead of points ) .",
    "the set of such fibers has continuum cardinality ( in fact , it has a cantor subset ) .",
    "thus it is not possible to prove the stronger statement that the attractors and repellers intersect each fiber at a single point only .",
    "there is a natural way to associate a random walk to a step skew product over a subshift of finite type .",
    "namely , convert the subshift into a markov process with a finite number of states  @xmath2 .",
    "take @xmath2 diffeomorphisms of the unit interval and apply them according to the current state of the process .",
    "this nonlinear random walk has no invariant lattice and the maps are not isometries .",
    "so in a sense we are in much more general situation here than in a classical random walk setting .",
    "nevertheless , in theorem  [ t : random ] we provide an explicit geometric characterization of the ergodic stationary measures of such walks , show there are only finitely many of such measures , and give a sharp estimate on their number . moreover , their ( random ) lyapunov exponents are shown to be negative .      among the dynamical systems ,",
    "the open set of hyperbolic ones ( also known as axiom  a ) is the best understood . for them ,",
    "smale s spectral decomposition theorem  @xcite allows one to split the non - wandering set into a finite collection of locally maximal hyperbolic sets .",
    "these unit sets admit finite markov partitions and , therefore , symbolic encodings .",
    "if any of them is an attractor , then it also carries an srb ( physical ) measure  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . thus the hyperbolic systems have both good dynamical and statistical descriptions .    from the works of abraham , smale  @xcite and newhouse  @xcite",
    "we know that axiom  a is not dense in @xmath4 .",
    "so the next step to understand generic systems is to consider partially hyperbolic ( ph ) ones  @xcite .",
    "the skew products over hyperbolic sets provide important examples of ph dynamics .",
    "their central bundles are tangent to the fibers .",
    "what makes it worthy to consider the ph skew products is that by hirsch ",
    "shub  @xcite theory , the systems _ conjugated _ to such skew products form an open subset in ph .",
    "so such skew products are in a sense locally generic .",
    "the markov encoding of the base reduces them to the skew products over subshifts of finite type , see def .",
    "[ d : skpr ] .",
    "the simplest skew products which correspond to @xmath5 have one - dimensional fibers .",
    "there is the single compact one - dimensional manifold without boundary , the circle  @xmath6 , and the single one with boundary , the interval  @xmath7 $ ] . as we already mentioned , the present work deals with skew products whose fibers are unit intervals .",
    "skew products are also widely used as a tool for the construction of ( robust ) examples of complicated behavior : convergence of orbits coexisting with minimality  @xcite , non - removable zero lyapunov exponents  @xcite , attractors with intermingled basins  @xcite , multidimensional robust non - hyperbolic attractors  @xcite , and others .",
    "so it is very challenging to obtain a description of their dynamics .    to date",
    ", more attention has been paid to skew products with circle fibers than to those with interval fibers .",
    "the skew products with circle fibers turned out to exhibit some effects that can not be observed for a single generic circle diffeomorphism . in his paper",
    "@xcite , antonov proved that in an open set of step skew products ( see def .",
    "[ d : step_and_mild ] ) with circle fibers the fiberwise coordinates of almost all orbits with the same base coordinate approach each other . later in  @xcite , this effect was re - discovered by kleptsyn and nalski in the following terms .",
    "a generic step skew product with circle fibers may have a measurable `` attracting '' section , which is fiberwise approached by orbits of almost every point . at the same time the section is dense in the phase space .",
    "this construction was generalized to the case of mild ( not necessarily step ) skew products by homburg in  @xcite .",
    "recall that the orbits of a single circle diffeomorphism either are dense ( irrational rotation number ) or tend to attracting periodic points ( rational rotation number ) .",
    "the examples  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite exhibit a mixture of these two types of behavior .",
    "the dynamical properties of generic diffeomorphisms of closed manifolds are known to be different from those of generic dissipative diffeomorphisms ( that is , diffeomorphisms onto the image of a compact manifold with boundary ) in the same dimension . for instance , a generic diffeomorphism of an interval has a finite number of fixed points .",
    "any other point tends toward a fixed point . on the other hand , minimal diffeomorphisms of a circle",
    "are ( metrically ) generic .",
    "this difference in behavior motivates us to go from studying skew products with circle fibers to skew products with interval fibers .",
    "note that each skew product with interval fibers can be extended to a skew product with circle fibers .",
    "namely , think of each interval fiber as of an arc of a circle and extend fiber maps to be circle diffeomorphisms . the simplest way to do it is to put a repelling fixed point at the complement to the arc .",
    "the resulting skew product with circle fibers can be made the same regularity of the fiber maps and the dependency of the fibers on the base as the initial interval skew product .",
    "thus our result also describes the dynamics of an open ( not dense ) set of circle skew products .",
    "in fact , our results are valid not only for the markov measures but for a wider class of shift - invariant measures .",
    "the only condition we really need is stated in prop .",
    "[ p : measure_property ] .",
    "roughly speaking , it says that for any fixed `` right tail '' @xmath8 of the symbolic sequence in the base , the conditional probability to see any allowed symbol @xmath9 at the position  @xmath10 is bounded from zero .",
    "similar statements also hold for generic _ mild _ ( see def .",
    "[ d : step_and_mild ] ) skew products with interval fibers ; however , the genericity conditions must be changed .",
    "the proofs for this case require ideas beyond the present work , and we intend to present them in a separate paper .      in this paper",
    "we always assume that the fiberwise maps preserve the orientation of the unit interval .",
    "when this is not the case , our results can be derived as follows .",
    "pass to the orientation - preserving covering .",
    "namely , take two copies of the set of markov states , marked with * + * and * -*. the orientation - preserving fiber maps take * + * to * + * and * - * to * -*. the orientation - changing fiber maps take * + * to * - * and * - * to * + *",
    ". then our main result can be applied .",
    "after that we project the attractors and repellers back to the initial space .",
    "the proof of our main result , thm .",
