    "cosmic strings ( for a recent review see @xcite and @xcite for earlier reviews ) are linear topological defects ( concentrations of energy which are stable for topological reasons ) and may have formed in the early universe during symmetry breaking phase transitions predicted by microphysical theories ( eg grand unified theories ( guts ) ) .",
    "in contrast to other topological defects ( walls and gauged monopoles ) cosmic strings are consistent with big bang cosmology and do not overclose the universe .",
    "their evolution generically includes a mechanism which transfers energy from the string network to gravitational radiation through the production and oscillation of massive string loops .",
    "the cosmological effects of cosmic strings are completely determined by the single free parameter of the model which is the mass per unit length @xmath0 of the string or equivalently the dimensionless product @xmath1 where @xmath2 is newton s constant . due to lorentz invariance under boosts along the direction of the string",
    "this is equal to the tension of the strings and is determined by the scale of symmetry breaking that gave rise to the string network .      the simplest model in which strings involving gauge fields can form@xcite is the abelian higgs model involving the breaking of a @xmath3 gauge symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian of the abelian higgs model is of the form = 12 d_d^- v()+ 14 f _",
    "f^ [ strlang ] where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and v()= 4 ( ||^2 - ^2)^2 [ strpot ] with @xmath6 . the topological stability of the string ( vortex in two space dimensions ) is due to the conservation of the topological invariant ( topological charge or winding number ) m=_0 ^ 2 d dwhere @xmath7 is an angular variable determining the orientation of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in the vacuum manifold which is @xmath10 ( circle ) in the abelian higgs model and @xmath11 is the azimouthal angle around the vortex in physical space .",
    "the field configuration of a vortex may be described by the following ansatz : & = & f(r ) e^i m   + a & = & v(r)r e_with @xmath12 ( for single - valuedness of the field at @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( for finite energy ) .",
    "the forms of @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be obtained numerically@xcite from the field equations with the above ansatz .",
    "the energy of the vortex configuration ( energy of string per unit length ) is = d^2 x ( f^2 + v^2 + ( ev - m)^2f^2 + 4 ( f^2 -^2)^2 ) clearly , @xmath18 is required for finite energy the gauge field is needed in order to screen the logarithmically divergent energy coming from the angular gradient of the scalar field . a vortex with no gauge fields",
    "is known as _ a global vortex _ and its energy per unit length diverges logarithmically with distance from the string core .",
    "this divergence however is not necessarily a problem in systems where there is a built - in scale cutoff like systems involving interacting vortices . in such systems",
    "the intervortex distance provides a natural cutoff scale for the energy integral .    even though no analytic solution has been found for the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", it is straightforward to obtain the asymptotic form of these functions from the field equations ( nielsen - olesen equations ) .",
    "the obtained asymptotic form for @xmath19 is@xcite ( but see ref .",
    "@xcite for a correction to the standard result for @xmath20 ) f(r ) & & - c_f e^- r + v(r ) & & me -c_v e^-e r where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants .",
    "therefore the width of the vortex is w~^-1 where @xmath23 is the parameter of the symmetry breaking potential also known as _ the scale of symmetry breaking_. the energy per unit length @xmath0 may also be approximated in terms of @xmath23 as _ w d^2 x v(0 ) ~^2 the typical symmetry breaking scale for guts is @xmath24 which leads to extremely thin and massive strings with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the formation of the string network occurs during the symmetry breaking phase transition when the thermal fluctuations of the complex field @xmath8 drop and the field relaxes to the minimum of its potential ( vacuum manifold )",
    ". the phase of the field after its relaxation will be randomly determined and will vary at causally disconnected regions of the universe . after the field relaxes to its vacuum , there will be ( by causality ) regions of the universe where the field @xmath8 will span the whole vacuum manifold as we travel around a circle in physical space . by continuity of @xmath8",
    "there will be a point inside this circle where @xmath28 .",
    "such a point ( and its neighbourhood ) will be associated with high energy density due to the local maximum of the potential ( [ strpot ] ) at @xmath28 .",
    "this process has been verified by numerically simulating@xcite the evolution of gauged and scalar fields during the phase transition in an expanding background . by extending this argument to three dimensions ,",
    "the point becomes a line of trapped energy density known as the _ cosmic string_. this formation mechanism is known as the kibble mechanism@xcite .    in general cosmic strings form in field theories where there are closed loops in the vacuum manifold",
    "@xmath29 that can not be shrank to a point without leaving @xmath29 .",
    "in homotopy theory terms , we require that the first homotopy group of the vacuum should be non - trivial @xmath30 .",
    "it may be shown that this is equivalent to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unbroken group in the symmetry breaking @xmath33",
    "( m = g / h ) .",
    "the exact analytic treatment of the evolution of a network of strings would involve the analytic solution of the time dependent nonlinear field equations derived from the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ strlang ] ) with arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "unfortunately no analytic solution is known for these equations even for the simplest nontrivial ansatz of the static nielsen - olesen vortex .",
    "even the numerical solution of these equations is practically impossible for systems of cosmological scales and with complicated initial conditions .",
    "the obvious alternative is to resort to realistic approximations in the numerical solution of the field equations in cosmological systems .",
    "first , the correct initial conditions for a numerical simulation must be obtained by simulating the above described kibble mechanism on a lattice .",
    "this may be achieved by implementing a monte - carlo simulation implemented first by vachaspati and vilenkin @xcite .",
    "they considered a discretization of the vacuum manifold ( @xmath10 ) into three points and then assigned randomly these three discrete phases to points on a square lattice in physical space in three dimensions .",
    "for those square plaquettes for which a complete winding of the phase in the vacuum manifold occured , they assigned a string segment passing through .",
    "it may be shown that this algorithm leads to strings with no ends within the lattice volume strings either form loops or go through the entire lattice volume ( infinite strings ) .",
    "this simulation showed that the initial string network consists of 80% long strings and 20% loops .    in order to find the cosmological effects of this initial string network ,",
    "it must be evolved in time . since it is impractical to evolve the full field equations on the vast range of scales @xmath34 ( string width ) to @xmath35 ( largest cosmological scales ) we must resort to some approximation scheme .",
    "the ratio @xmath36 of the width of the string over the string coherence scale is an intrinsically small parameter for cosmological strings ( @xmath37 for @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , this parameter can be used to develop a perturbation expansion@xcite for the action that describes the dynamics of a string segment .",
    "the zeroth order approximation is obtained for @xmath39 .",
    "it is the generalization of the point particle relativistic action to the string with mass per unit length @xmath0 known as _",
    "nambu action _ and is defined as : s=-_a^b dl d + o(w / r ) where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) is the metric of the world sheet spanned by the string ( @xmath43 is a four - vector that determines the location of the string worldsheet in 4d spacetime ) .",
    "the corrections to the nambu action are of order of the string width @xmath44 divided by its curvature radius ( coherence length ) @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the nambu action is an excellent approximation to the dynamics of non - intersecting cosmic string segments and is much simpler to handle numerically than the full field theoretic action .",
    "a crucial assumption in the derivation of the nambu action is that string segments do not interact with each other .",
    "this assumption breaks down when two string segments intersect .",
    "the outcome of such an event can only be found by evolving the full field equations .",
    "such numerical experiments have shown@xcite that at intersections string segments _ exchange parteners _ ( rather than passing through each other ) and a process known as _ intercommuting _ occurs .",
    "intercommuting is closely related to the right angle scattering of vortices in head on collisions which has been observed in several numerical experiments@xcite and can be analytically understood using dynamics in moduli spaces@xcite .",
    "intercommuting tends to favor the formation of string loops which oscillate and decay by emitting gravitational radiation with characteristic frequency @xmath46 ( @xmath45 is the loop radius ) and rate @xmath47 ( @xmath48)@xcite . once the loop radius shrinks down to the string width ( scale of symmetry breaking ) the loops decay to particles and may provide a mechanism for explaining the observed ultra - high energy cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "therefore , this mechanism for loop formation , provides also an efficient way for converting long string energy that redshifts with the universe expansion as @xmath49 to radiation energy that redshifts as @xmath50 .",
    "this is the crucial feature that prohibits strings from dominating the energy density of the universe during the radiation era and makes the cosmic string theory a viable theory for structure formation in the universe .    using the monte - carlo initial conditions described above , the nambu action to evolve string segments and intercommuting to describe intersection events",
    ", it is straightforward ( though not easy ) to construct numerical simulations describing the evolution of the string network in an expanding universe . using this approach",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the initial string network quickly relaxes in a robust way to a scale invariant configuration known as _",
    "the scaling solution_. according to the scaling solution the only scale that characterizes the string network is the horizon scale at any given time . on scales larger than the causal horizon scale @xmath51 , the network consists of a random walk of long strings which are coherent on approximately horizon scales . on scales smaller than the horizon more recent simulations @xcite have shown ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that the network consists of a fixed number of approximately 10 long strings coherent on horizon scales and a large number of tiny loops with typical radius @xmath52 .",
    "the efficient formation of tiny loops by the intercommuting of long strings on small scales leads to the existence of wiggles on the long strings ( wiggly strings ) which further affect the evolution of the network@xcite .",
    "the _ effective _ mass per unit length of wiggly strings is larger than the bare mass ( @xmath53 ) and their tension is smaller than the bare tension@xcite .    .",
    "[ fig1 ]    there is a simple heuristic way to understand why does the network of strings approach a scaling solution with a fixed number of long strings per horizon scale .",
    "consider for example the case when the number of long strings per horizon increases drastically .",
    "this will inevitably lead to more efficient intercommuting and loop formation thus transfering energy from long strings to loops and reducing the number of long strings per horizon back to its equilibrium value . similarly",
    "if the number of long strings decreases reduced intercommuting and loop formation will tend to increase the number of long strings towards an equilibrium value .",
    "these heuristic arguments have been put in more detailed form using differential equations in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most important interaction on cosmological scales is gravity .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the gravitational effects of strings in order to understand their cosmological predictions .",
    "the straight string solution is thin , cylindrically symmetric and lorentz invariant for boosts along the length of the string .",
    "this imposes the following constraint on components of the energy momentum tensor @xmath54 t_z^z ( ) = t_0 ^ 0 ( ) ( x ) ( y ) also t^ _ , = 0 t_x^x ( ) = 0 t_x^x = t_y^y=0 where use was made of the cylindrical symmetry and of the fact that @xmath55 as @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the string energy momentum tensor may be approximated by t _",
    "( x ) ( y ) diag(,0,0,-)diag(,p_x , p_y , p_z ) which implies that the string has significant negative pressure ( tension ) along the z direction p_z = -=- p_x = p_y = 0 this form of @xmath54 may be used to obtain the newtonian limit for gravitational interactions of strings with matter . for the newtonian potential @xmath56 we have ^2 = 4g(+",
    "_ i p_i)=0 = 0 [ newtpot1]and a test particle would feel no force by a nearby motionless straight string",
    ".    simulations have shown however that realistic strings are neither straight nor motionless .",
    "instead they have small scale wiggles and move with typical velocities of @xmath57 coherent on horizon scales .",
    "what is the energy momentum tensor and metric of such wiggly strings ?    the main effect of wiggles on strings is to destroy lorentz invariance along the string axis , to reduce the effective tension and to increase proportionaly the effective mass per unit length of the string .",
    "thus , the energy momentum tensor of a straight wiggly string is t _ ( x ) ( y ) diag(_eff , 0 , 0 , -t)[wigtmn ] with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite ( @xmath0 is the ` bare ' mass per unit length obtained from the field lagrangian ) .",
    "as expected the above @xmath61 reduces to the smooth straight string case for @xmath62 .",
    "the breaking of lorentz invariance by the wiggles also induces a non - zero newtonian force between the wiggly string at rest and a test particle , since the tension ( negative pressure ) is not able to completely cancel the effects of the energy density ( eq .",
    "( [ newtpot1 ] ) ) .",
    "this may be seen more clearly by using the einstein s equations with the tensor of eq .",
    "( [ wigtmn ] ) to find the metric around a wiggly string .",
    "the result in the weak field limit ( small @xmath1 ) is@xcite ds^2 = ( 1+h_00 ) ( dt^2 -dz^2 - ( 1 - 4g_eff)^2 r^2 d^2 ) [ strmet1]with h_00 = 4g(_eff - t ) ln(r",
    "/ r_0 ) where @xmath63 is an integration constant .",
    "clearly , in the presence of wiggles ( @xmath64 ) the newtonian potential @xmath65 is non - zero .",
    "the change of the azimouthal variable @xmath66 to the new variable @xmath67 makes the metric ( [ strmet1 ] ) very similar to the minkowski metric with the crucial difference of the presence of the newtonian @xmath65 term and the fact that the new azimouthal variable @xmath68 does not vary between @xmath69 and @xmath70 but between @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore there is a _ deficit angle _",
    "@xcite @xmath72 in the space around a wiggly or non - wiggly string .",
    "such a spacetime is called _ conical _ and leads to several interesting cosmological effects especially for moving long strings .",
    "the main mechanism by which strings create perturbations that could lead to large scale structure formation is based on velocity perturbations created by moving long strings .",
    "long , approximatelly straight strings moving with velocity @xmath73 induce velocity perturbations to the surrounding matter directed towards the surface swept in space by the string .    using the geodesic equations in the spacetime of a moving long strings it may be shown that the total velocity perturbation induced by a moving long string to surrounding matter close to the surface swept by the string is v = 2 g ( _ eff -t ) + 4 g _",
    "eff v_s _ s where the first term is due to the newtonian interaction of the string wiggles with matter while the second term is an outcome of the conical nature of the spacetime .",
    "another particularly interesting effect of the string induced deficit angle is the creation of a characteristic signature on cmb photons .",
    "the type of this signature may be seen in a heuristic way as follows : consider a straight long string moving with velocity @xmath73 between the surface of last scattering occuring at the time of recombination @xmath74 and an observer at the present time @xmath75 .",
    "the presense of the moving long string between the observer and the last scattering surface induces an effective doppler shift to the cmb photons due to the deficit angle of the moving long string . for photons reaching the observer through the ` back ' ( ` front ' ) of the string we have ( tt)_1,(2 ) = 4 g _",
    "eff v_s _ s where the @xmath76 and @xmath77 refer to photons passing through the ` back ' ( ` front ' ) of the string .",
    "therefore a moving long string present between @xmath74 and today induces line step - like discontinuities on the cmb sky with magnitude@xcite = 8 g _",
    "eff v_s _ s this effect is known as the kaiser - stebbins effect .",
    "notice that there is no newtonian term inversely proportional to the wiggly string velocity as was the case for the induced velocity perturbations .",
    "as expected , photons do not feel the newtonian interaction with strings .",
    "this is a crucial observation related to the formation of the doppler peak in the cmb spectrum by wiggly strings ( see section 3 ) .    due to the conical nature of the spacetime around a straight cosmic string it acts like a cylindrical gravitational lens@xcite with a very unusual and characteristic pattern of lensed images@xcite .",
    "the two images of a source behind a string which creates a conical spacetime with deficit angle @xmath78 are separated by an angle = where @xmath79 is the angular diameter distance from us to the source , @xmath80 is the distance between source and lens and @xmath11 is the angle between the string tangent vector and the line of sight . these images are predicted to appear at equal magnitudes with no magnification or distortion ( but at slightly different redshifts if the string is moving ) unlike the lensing patterns of ordinary gravitational lenses .",
    "therefore a gravitational lensing event induced by a cosmic string is expected to involve a number of neighbouring double images with typical separation of a few arcsec .",
    "having completed a brief review of the main cosmological effects of cosmic strings i will now give a brief historical overview of the development of the model .",
    "i first discuss in the next section the development during the eighties : the _ golden age _ of the cosmic string model .",
    "the strong constraints that practically rule out the model obtained in the nineties will be discussed in section 3 while recent lensing events that give some marginal hope for the existence of lighter strings are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the conclusion of the review is given in section 5 .",
    "the interest on cosmic strings as a possible theory for structure formation originated in the early eighties with two papers by vilenkin @xcite and zeldovich @xcite who pointed out that loops of linear defects produced during gut phase transitions had the right effective gravitational mass to act as seeds for the formation of galaxies .",
    "this observation opened two major prospects :    * the potential verification of the gut s via cosmological observations * the resolution of the long standing puzzle of the origin the primordial fluctuations that gave rise to structure formation    this was a prime example of a meeting point between macrophysics ( cosmology ) and microphysics ( particle physics ) .",
    "these prospects gave the motivation for intense research activity on the subject in the eighties .",
    "new papers appeared in the early eighties with more encouraging results @xcite showing that not only gut string loops had the right mass to be the seeds of galaxy formation but also they could produce the observed galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xcite and the observed cluster - cluster correlation function .",
    "it was the first time that a model based on concrete microphysical theories could make such successful macrophysical predictions even if they were still qualitative at that stage .",
    "cosmic strings could even resurrect neutrinos as dark matter candidates ( hot dark matter ( hdm ) ) .",
    "neutrinos were ruled out as dark matter in the context of adiabatic perturbations coming from inflation because they predicted that in contrast to observations , smaller structures form by fragmentation of larger ones@xcite .",
    "the problem was the free streaming of fast moving neutrinos which wiped out galactic scale fluctuations .",
    "cosmic string seeds however could survive the free streaming of neutrinos and form galaxies earlier@xcite than larger structures in agreement with observations .",
    "larger planar structures due to long string wakes were also more prominent with hdm@xcite than with cdm@xcite .    these successes of the theory which mainly appeared in the first half of the eighties decade lead to a dramatic increase in the number of papers in the second half of the decade ( see fig .",
    "the number of papers with the word cosmic strings in their title from 23 in the first half of the decade ( 1980 - 1985 ) soared to 272 in the second half ( 1985 - 1990 ) .",
    "this would be its peak for the years to come .",
    "it soon became clear to the community that the inherent nonlinearities in the formation and cosmological evolution of cosmic string networks make it difficult to make quantitative predictions for detailed comparison with observations .",
    "in the mean time , during the same decade , the competing model for structure formation based on quantum fluctuations produced during inflation developed much faster .",
    "the linear nature of inflationary perturbations allowed detailed comparison with cosmological data for galaxies and large scale structure .",
    "this comparison showed that the scale invariant gaussian primordial perturbations produced during inflation combined with @xmath81 cold dark matter ( cdm ) were consistent with most cosmological observations of the time and started to reduce the interest on cosmic strings towards the end of the eighties@xcite .",
    "the flat gaussian cdm model based on inflation was established as the standard model for structure formation .",
    "it became clear that detailed and reliable numerical simulations of the cosmic string network evolution were needed in order to keep the cosmic string theory alive .",
    "an early simulation of the cosmic string network evolution @xcite had indicated that at any time there was one long string per horizon volume with curvature radius about the horizon length and it would chop off by intercommuting about one horizon scale loop per expansion time .",
    "this parent loop would then fragment into a few daughter loops which would live @xmath82 times longer before loosing all their energy to gravitational radiation . as discussed in the introduction this energy loss mechanism",
    "allows the network density to scale like the background cosmological density and prevents it from dominating and overclosing the universe .",
    "this type of network solution is known as the _",
    "scaling solution_. in this picture , the growth of density inhomogeneities starts at the redshift of matter domination @xmath83 ( assuming cdm ) when most of the string density is in slowly moving loops produced at earlier times .",
    "these loops were shown to have a number density and correlation function comparable to that of bright galaxies@xcite . since most of the string mass was found to be in loops , the accretion around the much less dense long strings was ignored .    even though this one loop - one object picture produced a mass function of haloes that fitted both the number density of bright galaxies and the number density of clusters with the same value of mass per unit length @xmath0@xcite predicted by gut s it was realized to be incorrect towards the end of the eighties by detailed numerical simulations of string network evolution .",
    "these simulations were performed independently by three groups @xcite and showed that the efficiency with which a network of long strings chops off loops is much less than previously thought .",
    "a much denser network of long strings is thus required to chop off enough decaying loops to keep the long strings scaling with the cosmological density . in addition it was found that the size of the produced loops at any given time is much smaller and their number density is much greater .",
    "these results changed drastically the original one loop - one object picture described above .",
    "the small and fast loops produced after the time of equal matter and radiation @xmath84 would produce linear wakes at least tens of @xmath85 long .",
    "it is implausible to associate such an elongated structure to a single galaxy .",
    "thus it was realized that the dominant perturbations produced by the cosmic string network are due to horizon sized long strings which produce velocity perturbations that lead to planar overdensities ( wakes ) as they move through the homogeneous cosmological background .",
    "according to the new simulations there are about ten horizon sized long strings per horizon volume at any given time .",
    "due to the production of several small loops these strings are not smooth but have a wiggly structure ( this picture however has been disputed again by more recent simulations@xcite indicating that strings may indeed be smooth ! ) .",
    "the planar wakes produced by these strings give rise to a network of planar overdensities with a distinguished scale of about @xmath86 and thickness of about @xmath87@xcite which were more pronounced in cosmic string models with hdm @xcite .",
    "the kaiser - stebbins temperature discontinuities produced in the cmb sky by long cosmic strings are thought to be the characteristic imprint of a cosmic string network on the cmb .",
    "the first attempt towards obtaining a detailed pattern of these discontinuities was made in ref .",
    "@xcite where the evolution of cmb photons was simulated through an evolving string network from @xmath74 to the present time @xmath75 .",
    "this type of simulations was further improved in the nineties @xcite and the full cosmic string cmb spectrum was derived showing no evidence for acoustic oscillations ( doppler peak ) .",
    "however , all such numerical approaches suffer from an important drawback : their dynamic range can not extend as to cover the required cosmic expansion factor of @xmath82 due to the vast range of scales involved .",
    "this problem is verified with the latest such string simulations which show a dependence of the string cmb normalization on the resolution of the simulation used@xcite .",
    "thus , some type of network modeling is required in order to obtain detailed observational predictions including small scales .",
    "there have been several attempts to construct such analytical network models@xcite capturing the main features of the new string evolution simulations .",
    "early encouraging analytical results using this type of models indicated that on large scales cosmic strings predict a scale invariant spectrum@xcite ( which is in agreement@xcite with the cobe spectrum ) with well defined non - gaussian features@xcite .",
    "in addition to deriving the predicted cmb scale invariant spectrum on large scales these early studies showed that wiggly gauged strings predict the existence of a doppler peak@xcite in the cmb spectrum in contrast to global defects@xcite where decoherence dominates and leads to a smearing of the doppler peak .",
    "the origin of this peak is the wiggly nature of long strings whose newtonian interaction affects the plasma more significantly than it affects the photons between @xmath74 and the present time@xcite .",
    "the existence of such a peak was confirmed by more recent studies@xcite where analytical models were fed as input into standard cosmological evolution codes for the detailed derivation of the full cmb and lss power spectra from primordial fluctuations .",
    "it was found that the doppler peak is lower compared to observations and shifted towards smaller scales ( larger @xmath88 ) .",
    "the coherence scale of long strings is significantly smaller than the horizon at @xmath74 .",
    "the derived spectra were then compared@xcite with the corresponding observational data .",
    "as discussed below these results constrain the string contribution to the primordial fluctuations to be less than @xmath89 .",
    "this severe constraint on the cosmic string contribution to the primordial fluctuations can be translated into corresponding constraints onto the models that predict cosmic string formation after hybrid inflation@xcite . this prospect gains importance in view of the fact that string theory or m - theory demands@xcite the formation of a network of cosmic strings after a period of inflation induced by the collision of branes that merge to form the brane on which we live .",
    "thus , according to these models the cmb temperature power spectrum emerges as a superposition of adiabatic gaussian perturbations coming from brane inflation and cosmic string perturbations with weighting factors @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively ie c_l = w c_l^adiabatic + b c_l^strings comparison of the predicted forms of @xmath92 and @xmath93 with the wmap observed spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that in a @xmath94 universe , the spectrum is well fit by pure adiabatic perturbations@xcite and @xmath95 at the @xmath96 confidence level @xcite . a tiny contribution from strings ( about @xmath97",
    "can slightly improve the fit to the data@xcite but it is constrained to @xmath98 at the @xmath99 confidence level @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath91 translates to a constraint on the effective string mass parameter @xmath0 as g1.3 10 ^ -6 where @xmath100 is a dimensionless measure of the intercommutation rate ( the probability of string segments exchanging partners at colision ) which is less than 1 in models with extra dimensions like brane inflation .",
    "the constraint on the parameter @xmath1 ( the single parameter of the cosmic string model ) constrains also the magnitude of the predicted large scale structure ( lss ) power spectrum@xcite to less that @xmath89 of the observed one ( fig .",
    "the lss spectrum constraints however can be made weaker in an open universe@xcite according to a study based of numerical evolution of the string network in an open cdm cosmology .",
    "upper and @xmath101 lower ) predicted in the cosmic string theory ( dot - dashed lines ) is significantly different compared to the spectrum observed by wmap which practically coincides with the inflationary predictions ( from ref .",
    "@xcite).,width=253,height=302 ]    comparable or even stronger constraints on @xmath1 can be imposed by a direct search for the predicted kaiser - stebbins temperature discontinuities predicted to exist in cmb maps . despite preliminary encouraging results@xcite utilizing the cobe data ,",
    "a recent detailed statistical analysis@xcite searching for such signatures in the wmap high resolution cmb maps found no such non - gaussian signal .",
    "this negative result is translated to a stringent constraint of @xmath1 g3.3 10 ^ -7 [ smb ]        accelerating massive string segments are expected to produce gravitational waves leading to a stochastic gravitational wave background produced by the string network .",
    "such a background would distort the regularity of the pulsar timing which is not observed .",
    "this lack of distortion puts an upper limit to the energy density of stochastic gravitational waves which is translated to a tight bound @xcite on @xmath1 as g10 ^ -7 [ gwb]there are uncertainties involved in this bound however because its main source is the loop component and the small scales of the string network which is the most uncertain part of the sting network simulations .",
    "these constraints on the string network are easily translated into useful constraints for the brane inflation models that predict its formation . to rescue brane inflation various mechanisms",
    "have been proposed which either consider more complicated models , or require additional ingredients so that cosmic strings are not produced at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "more optimistic approaches have claimed that even without modifications , the cosmic string contribution is subdominant anyway for small enough couplings and is therefore consistent with the data@xcite .",
    "despite the above severe constraints which have significantly decreased the interest in the cosmic string theory as a model contributing to structure formation , the possibility of lighter strings existing in the universe remains and can not be excluded .",
    "there are two observational sources that can lead to detection of such lighter strings : gravitational lensing and gravitational radiation .",
    "lensing events consistent with a cosmic string playing the role of the lense had been reported a few years ago @xcite but a more careful analysis indicated that they were not due to a string . more recent searches @xcite for string induced lensed pairs have lead to negative results . however a new candidate event named csl-1 ( capodimonte - sternberg lens candidate no.1 ) was reported a couple of years ago by a russian - italian collaboration @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing property of csl-1 ( fig .",
    "5 ) is that the object is clearly extended and the isophotes of the two sources show no distortion at all .",
    "also both images have a redshift of 0.46 and the two spectra are identical at a @xmath102 confidence level .",
    "extensive modeling of the photometric properties of csl-1 showed that no traditional lensing by compact lens can satisfactorily fit the observed morphology .",
    "the most likely explanation of the observed properties of csl-1 is that it is the result of lensing by an interposed cosmic string .",
    "such a string should have g410 ^ -7to produce the observed image separation ( @xmath103 ) at the observed redshift @xmath104 .",
    "this range is marginally in conflict with the statistical cmb bounds coming from the lack of linear discontinuities in the wmap maps ( see eq ( [ smb ] ) ) and with the corresponding bound coming from the stochastic gravitational wave background of eq ( [ gwb ] ) . in a more recent publication@xcite the csl collaboration reported a significant excess of lensed pairs in the field of csl-1 ( @xmath105 spaned by @xmath106 pixels ) over the no more than two lensed pairs expected due to conventinal lensing objects such as galaxies .        in the case of a straight string",
    "approximatelly 9 lensed pairs would be expected in the field , going up to 200 pairs for a random walk shape of the string .",
    "the observed number of pairs was 11 but they were not concentrated on a roughly linear strip . a detailed spectroscopic analysis ( in progress by the csl collaboration )",
    "is required in order to resolve the issue .",
    "scientific progress is achieved by continous interaction between theory and experiment or observation .",
    "theoretical models make predictions which are tested by experiments or observation thus confirming or ruling out the corresponding models . in order to achieve such progress",
    "the models should be defined well enough to make unique predictions and the experiment should be accurate enough to determine if these predictions are realized in nature . until a couple of decades ago neither of these conditions were fulfilled for cosmology .",
    "models had too many parameters to make unique predictions and observations were not accurate enough to conclusively test the theoretical predictions .",
    "for example scalar field inflation has in principle an infinite number of parameters since the dynamics of the scalar field is determined by an unspecified potential .",
    "thus even though generically inflation predicts a flat space with scale invariant gaussian primordial perturbations it is easy to chose parameters leading to an open universe with non - gaussian perturbations and a tilted spectrum .",
    "even the most precise observations would have a hard time to rule out such a model .",
    "in contrast to inflation , the cosmic string theory for cosmological perturbations has a single free parameter @xmath1 whose value is well constrained by microphysics to @xmath107 .",
    "this is a well defined theory whose predictions were subject to detailed comparison with accurate cosmological observations during the past decade . from this comparison",
    "it became clear that the model is ruled out and at best it could have a tiny contribution ( less than @xmath108 ) to the primordial perturbation spectrum .",
    "such a healthy example of scientific progress through the interaction between theory and observations is unfortunately not very frequent even during the present era of precision cosmology .",
    "the cosmic string theory had the luck to consist one of the few exceptions to this rule .",
