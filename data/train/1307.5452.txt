    "about ten years ago , a peculiar dynamical phenomenon was discovered in populations of identical phase oscillators : under nonlocal symmetric coupling , the coexistence of coherent ( synchronized ) and incoherent oscillators was observed @xcite .",
    "this highly counterintuitive phenomenon was given the name chimera state after the greek mythological creature made up of different animals @xcite . since",
    "then the study of chimera states has been the focus of extensive research in a wide number of models , from kuramoto phase oscillators @xcite to periodic and chaotic maps @xcite , as well as stuart - landau oscillators @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence of chimera states was found in populations of coupled chemical oscillators as well as in optical coupled - map lattices realized by liquid - crystal light modulators @xcite .",
    "recently , moreover , martens and coauthors showed that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition between two antagonistic synchronization patterns in a mechanical experiment involving two subpopulations of identical metronomes coupled in a hierarchical network @xcite .    in the context of neuroscience",
    ", a similar effort has been undertaken by several groups , since it is believed that chimera states might explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in many birds and dolphins which sleep with one eye open , meaning that one hemisphere of the brain is synchronouns whereas the other is asynchronous @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make a contribution in this direction , by identifying for the first time a variety of single and multi - chimera states in networks of non - locally coupled neurons represented by hindmarsh  rose oscillators .",
    "recently , multi - chimera states were discovered on a ring of nonlocally coupled fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) oscillators @xcite .",
    "the fhn model is a 2dimensional ( 2d ) simplification of the physiologically realistic hodgkin - huxley model @xcite and is therefore computationally a lot simpler to handle .",
    "however , it fails to reproduce several important dynamical behaviors shown by real neurons , like rapid firing or regular and chaotic bursting .",
    "this can be overcome by replacing the fhn with another well - known more realistic model for single neuron dynamics , the hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) model @xcite , which we will be used throughout this work both in its 2d and 3d versions .    in section 2 of this paper",
    ", we first treat the case of 2d - hr oscillators represented by two first order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) describing the interaction of a membrane potential and a single variable related to ionic currents across the membrane under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we review the dynamics in the 2d plane in terms of its fixed points and limit cycles , coupling each of the @xmath0 oscillators to @xmath1 nearest neighbors symmetrically on both sides , in the manner adopted in @xcite , through which chimeras were discovered in fhn oscillators .",
    "we identify parameter values for which chimeras appear in this setting and note the variety of oscillating patterns that are possible due to the bistability features of the 2d model .",
    "in particular , we identify a new `` mixed oscillatory state '' ( mos ) , in which the desynchronized neurons are uniformly distributed among those attracted by a stable stationary state .",
    "furthermore , we also discover chimera  like patterns in the more natural setting where only the membrane potential variables are coupled with @xmath2 of the same type .",
    "next , we turn in section 3 to the more realistic 3d - hr model where a third variable is added representing a slowly varying current , through which the system can also exhibit bursting modes . here , we choose a different type of coupling where the two first variables are coupled symmetrically to @xmath2 of their own kind and observe only states of complete synchronization as well as mos in which desynchronized oscillators are interspersed among neurons that oscillate in synchrony . however , when coupling is allowed only among the first ( membrane potential ) variables chimera states are discovered in cases where spiking occurs within sufficiently long bursting intervals .",
    "finally , the paper ends with our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "following the particular type of setting proposed in @xcite we consider @xmath0 nonlocally coupled hindmarsh - rose oscillators , where the interconnections between neurons exist with @xmath3 nearest neighbors only on either side as follows : @xmath4 \\label{eq:01 } \\\\",
    "\\dot y_k & = & 1 - 5x_k^2-y_k+ \\frac{\\sigma_y}{2r}\\sum_{j = k - r}^{j = k+r } [ b_{yx}(x_j - x_k)+b_{yy}(y_j - y_k ) ] .",

    "this induces nonlocality in the form of a ring topology established by considering periodic boundary conditions for our systems of odes . as in @xcite ,",
    "our system contains not only direct @xmath14 and @xmath15 coupling , but also cross - coupling between variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this feature is modeled by a rotational coupling matrix : @xmath18 depending on a coupling phase @xmath19 . in",
    "what follows , we study the collective behavior of the above system and investigate , in particular , the existence of chimera states in relation to the values of all network parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "more specifically , we consider two cases : ( @xmath22 ) direct and cross - coupling of equal strength in both variables ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) direct coupling in the @xmath16 variable only ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) . similarly to @xcite we shall use initial conditions randomly distributed on the unit circle ( @xmath27 ) .     at @xmath28 of eqs .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where the @xmath16 variable is plotted over the index number @xmath6 at a time snapshot chosen after a sufficiently long simulation of the system . in this figure",
    "the effect of different values of the phase @xmath19 is demonstrated while the number of oscillators @xmath0 and their nearest neighbors @xmath3 , as well as the coupling strengths @xmath23 are kept constant . for example , for @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ) an interesting novel type of dynamics is observed that we shall call `` mixed oscillatory state '' ( mos ) , whereby nearly half of the @xmath5 are attracted to a fixed point ( at this snapshot they are all at a value near @xmath35 ) , while the other half are oscillating interspersed among the stationary ones . from the respective time series ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) , right ) it is clear that the former correspond to spiking neurons whereas the latter to quiescent ones .",
    "this interesting mos phenomenon is due to the fact that , in the standard parameter values we have chosen , the uncoupled hr oscillators are characterized by the property of _",
    "bistability_. clearly , as shown in the phase portrait of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , each oscillator possesses three fixed points : the leftmost fixed point is a stable node corresponding to the resting state of the neuron while the other two correspond to a saddle point and an unstable node and are therefore repelling . for @xmath11 ( which is the case here )",
    "a stable limit cycle also exists which attracts many of the neurons into oscillatory motion , rendering the system bistable and producing the dynamics observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "now , when a positive current @xmath36 is applied , the @xmath16-nullcline is lowered such that the saddle point and the stable node collide and finally vanish . in this case",
    "the full system enters a stable limit cycle associated with typical spiking behaviour .",
    "similar complex patterns including mos and chimeras have been observed in this regime as well .    .",
    "three fixed points coexist with a stable limit cycle.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for @xmath31 , on the other hand , there is a `` shift '' in the dynamics of the individual neurons into the spiking regime , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](b ) ( right ) .",
    "the corresponding spatial pattern has a wave - like form of period 2 .",
    "then , for @xmath32 a classical chimera state with two incoherent domains is observed ( ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) , left ) . diagonal coupling ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) is , therefore , identified as the necessary condition to achieve chimera states . by contrast , it is interesting to note that in nonlocally coupled fitz - hugh nagumo oscillators @xcite it has been shown both analytically and numerically that chimera states occur for _ off - diagonal _ coupling .    by decreasing the range of coupling @xmath3 and increasing the system size @xmath0 , chimera states occur with multiple domains of incoherence and coherence for @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c , d ) ) , and , accordingly , periodic spatial patterns with larger wave numbers arise for @xmath31 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a , b ) .",
    "this is in agreement with previous works reported in @xcite .",
    "next we consider the case ( @xmath24 ) where the coupling term is restricted to the @xmath16 variable .",
    "this case is important since incorporating the coupling in the voltage membrane ( @xmath16 ) alone is more realistic from a biophysiological point of view . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] spatial plots ( left ) and the corresponding @xmath39-plane ( right ) for increasing coupling strength are shown .",
    "chimera states ( fig .",

    "in order to complete our study of the hindmarsh - rose model we shall consider , in this section , its three - dimensional version . the corresponding equations read :    @xmath50    the extra variable @xmath51 represents a slowly varying current , which changes the applied current @xmath52 to @xmath53 and guarantees firing frequency adaptation ( governed by the parameter @xmath54 ) as well as the ability to produce typical bursting modes , which the 2d model can not reproduce .",
    "parameter @xmath55 controls the transition between spiking and bursting , parameter @xmath56 determines the spiking frequency ( in the spiking regime ) and the number of spikes per bursting ( in the bursting regime ) , while @xmath57 sets the resting potential of the system .",
    "the parameters of the fast @xmath58 system are set to the same values used in the two - dimensional version ( @xmath8 , @xmath10 ) and typical values are used for the parameters of the @xmath51-equation ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "the 3d hindmarsh - rose model exhibits a rich variety of bifurcation scenarios in the @xmath62 parameter plane @xcite .",
    "thus , we prepare all nodes in the spiking regime ( with corresponding parameter values @xmath9 and @xmath63 ) and , as in section 2 , we use initial conditions randomly distributed on the unit sphere ( @xmath64 ) .    first let us consider direct coupling in both variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 and vary the value of the equal coupling strengths @xmath23 , while @xmath0 and @xmath3 are kept constant .",
    "naturally , the interaction of @xmath0 spiking neurons will lead to a change in their dynamics , as we discuss in what follows . for low values of @xmath65",
    "we observe the occurrence of a type of mos where nearly half of the neurons spike regularly in a synchronous fashion , while the rest are unsynchronized and spike in an irregular fashion .",
