    "was first proposed by maldacena in his seminal work  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the strong coupling in the framework of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , corresponds to a weak coupling in the gravity dual domain , and hence calculations can be more easily be performed in the gravity dual domain . with the increase in the separation between the quark and anti - quark ,",
    "the coupling constant would become larger , and hence , the potential can not be calculated accurately using perturbative qcd .",
    "the gravity dual model provides the ideal mathematical framework to determine the effect of a temperature gradient on the heavy quark anti - quark potential , when the separation between them is large . however , the gravity model in @xmath4 space is dual to n = 4 supersymmetric yang mills lagrangian , and hence our calculation would be for a n = 4 supersymmetric yang mills lagrangian instead of the qcd yang mills lagrangian .",
