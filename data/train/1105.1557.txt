    "despite the substantial effort toward quantizing gravity in 4 dimensions , this issue is still open .",
    "one of the best candidates till now is the superstring theory formulated in 10 dimensions .",
    "a way from superstring theory to 4-dimensional quantum gravity or standard model of particle physics ( minimal supersymmetric extension thereof ) is , at best , highly nonunique .",
    "many techniques of compactifications and flux stabilization along with specific model - building branes configurations and dualities , were worked out toward this end within the years .",
    "possibly some important data of a fundamental character are still missing enabling the connection with physics in dimension 4 .    in this paper",
    "we follow the idea from @xcite that different smoothings of euclidean @xmath0 are presumably crucial for the program of qg and string theory .",
    "these structures are footed certainly in dimension 4 and have great importance to physics @xcite . here",
    "we again try to consider exotic @xmath0 s as serving a link between higher dimensional superstring theory and 4-dimensional , , physical  theories . string theory d- and ns - branes in some backgrounds",
    "are correlated naturally with exotic smoothness on @xmath0 appearing in these backgrounds @xcite . moreover , when taking quantum limit of d - branes and spaces , such that these become represented by separable @xmath5-algebras , the connection with exotic @xmath0 s extends naturally .",
    "this is due to the representing exotic @xmath0 s by convolution @xmath5-algebras of the codimension - one foliations of certain 3-sphere . in this paper",
    "we focus on the topological level underlying the quantum branes and exotic @xmath0 s connection .",
    "we show that there exists topological counterparts of d - branes in a quantum regime .",
    "namely , by the use of @xmath6algebra approach to quantum d - branes the manifold model of a quantum d - brane as wild embedding is constructed .",
    "then we show that the @xmath6algebra of the wild embedding is isomorphic to the @xmath6algebra of the quantum d - brane .",
    "we call the wild embeddings representing quantum d - branes as _ topological quantum branes_. moreover , the low dimensional wild embedding , i.e. @xmath3 expresses the existence of the non - trivial @xmath7-field on the quantum level .",
    "next we construct a quantum version of an action using cyclic cohomology of @xmath5-algebra . in the classical limit this action reduces to the born - infeld one for flat branes given by tame embedding .    the basic technical ingredient of the analysis of small exotic @xmath0 s enabling uncovering many applications also in string theory is the relation between exotic ( small ) @xmath0 s and non - cobordant codimension-1 foliations of the @xmath8 as well gropes and wild embeddings as shown in @xcite .",
    "the foliation are classified by the godbillon - vey class as element of the cohomology group @xmath9 . by using the @xmath10-gerbes it was possible to interpret the integral elements @xmath11 as characteristic classes of a @xmath10-gerbe over @xmath8 @xcite",
    "in this short section we will only give a rough overview about a relation between small exotic @xmath0 and foliations .",
    "some of the details can be found in @xcite and more detailed approach will appear here @xcite . at first",
    "we will start with some facts about exotic 4-spaces .",
    "an exotic @xmath0 is a topological space with @xmath12topology but with a different ( i.e. non - diffeomorphic ) smoothness structure than the standard @xmath13 getting its differential structure from the product @xmath14 . the exotic @xmath0 is the only euclidean space @xmath15 with an exotic smoothness structure .",
    "the exotic @xmath0 can be constructed in two ways : by the failure to arbitrarily split a smooth 4-manifold into pieces ( large exotic @xmath0 ) and by the failure of the so - called smooth h - cobordism theorem ( small exotic @xmath0 ) . here",
    "we will use the second method .    consider the following situation : one has two topologically equivalent ( i.e. homeomorphic ) , simple - connected , smooth 4-manifolds @xmath16 , which are not diffeomorphic .",
    "there are two ways to compare them .",
    "first one calculates differential - topological invariants like donaldson polynomials @xcite or seiberg - witten invariants @xcite .",
    "but there is another possibility : it is known that one can change a manifold @xmath17 to @xmath18 by using a series of operations called surgeries .",
    "this procedure can be visualized by a 5-manifold @xmath19 , the cobordism .",
    "the cobordism @xmath19 is a 5-manifold having the boundary @xmath20 .",
    "if the embedding of both manifolds @xmath16 in to @xmath19 induces homotopy - equivalences then @xmath19 is called an h - cobordism .",
    "furthermore we assume that both manifolds @xmath16 are compact , closed ( no boundary ) and simply - connected .",
    "as freedman @xcite showed a h cobordism implies a homeomorphism , i.e. h - cobordant and homeomorphic are equivalent relations in that case .",
    "furthermore , for that case the mathematicians @xcite are able to prove a structure theorem for such h - cobordisms : + _ let @xmath19 be a h - cobordism between @xmath16",
    ". then there are contractable submanifolds @xmath21 together with a sub - cobordism @xmath22 with @xmath23 , so that the h - cobordism @xmath24 induces a diffeomorphism between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "_ + thus , the smoothness of @xmath17 is completely determined ( see also @xcite ) by the contractible submanifold @xmath27 and its embedding @xmath28 determined by a map @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31(@xmath32 is an involution ) .",
    "one calls @xmath27 , the _ akbulut cork_. according to freedman @xcite , the boundary of every contractible 4-manifold is a homology 3-sphere .",
    "this theorem was used to construct an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "then one considers a tubular neighborhood of the sub - cobordism @xmath33 between @xmath27 and @xmath34 .",
    "the interior @xmath35 ( as open manifold ) of @xmath33 is homeomorphic to @xmath0 . if ( and only if ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 are homeomorphic , but non - diffeomorphic 4-manifolds then @xmath36 is an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "as shown by bizaca and gompf @xcite one can use @xmath35 to construct an explicit handle decomposition of the exotic @xmath0 .",
    "we refer for the details of the construction to the papers or to the book @xcite .",
    "the idea is simply to use the cork @xmath27 and add some casson handle @xmath37 to it .",
    "the interior of this construction is an exotic @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we have to consider the casson handle and its construction in more detail .",
    "briefly , a casson handle @xmath37 is the result of attempts to embed a disk @xmath38 into a 4-manifold . in most cases this attempt fails and",
    "casson @xcite looked for a substitute , which is now called a casson handle .",
    "freedman @xcite showed that every casson handle @xmath37 is homeomorphic to the open 2-handle @xmath39 but in nearly all cases it is not diffeomorphic to the standard handle @xcite .",
    "the casson handle is built by iteration , starting from an immersed disk in some 4-manifold @xmath17 , i.e. a map @xmath40 with injective differential .",
    "every immersion @xmath40 is an embedding except on a countable set of points , the double points .",
    "one can kill one double point by immersing another disk into that point .",
    "these disks form the first stage of the casson handle . by iteration",
    "one can produce the other stages .",
    "finally consider not the immersed disk but rather a tubular neighborhood @xmath41 of the immersed disk , called a kinky handle , including each stage .",
    "the union of all neighborhoods of all stages is the casson handle @xmath37 .",
    "so , there are two input data involved with the construction of a @xmath37 : the number of double points in each stage and their orientation @xmath42 .",
    "thus we can visualize the casson handle @xmath37 by a tree : the root is the immersion @xmath40 with @xmath43 double points , the first stage forms the next level of the tree with @xmath43 vertices connected with the root by edges etc .",
    "the edges are evaluated using the orientation @xmath42 .",
    "every casson handle can be represented by such an infinite tree .",
    "the main idea of the relation between small exotic @xmath0 is the usage of a radial family of small exotic @xmath0 , i.e. a continuous family of exotic @xmath44}$ ] with parameter @xmath45 so that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are non - diffeomorphic for @xmath48 .",
    "this radial family has a natural foliation ( see theorem 3.2 in @xcite which can be induced by a polygon @xmath49 in the two - dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath50 . the area of @xmath49 is a well - known invariant , thegodbillon - vey class as element in @xmath9 , determing a codimension - one foliation on the 3-sphere ( firstly constructed by thurston @xcite , see also the book @xcite chapter viii for the details ) .",
    "this 3-sphere is part of the boundary @xmath51 of the akbulut cork @xmath27 ( or better there is an emebdding @xmath52 ) .",
    "furthermore one can show that the codimension - one foliation of the 3-sphere induces a codimension - one foliation of @xmath51 so that the area of the corresponding polygons ( and therefore the invariants ) agree .",
    "the godbillon - vey invariant @xmath53\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{r})$ ] of the foliation is related to the parameter of the radial family by @xmath54\\right\\rangle = \\rho^{2}$ ] using the pairing between cohomology and homology ( the fundamental class @xmath55\\in h_{3}(s^{3})$ ] ) .",
    "thus we are able to obtain a relation between an exotic @xmath0 ( of bizaca as constructed from the failure of the smooth h - cobordism theorem ) and codimension - one foliation of the @xmath8 .",
    "two non - diffeomorphic exotic @xmath0implying non - cobordant codimension - one foliations of the 3-sphere described by the godbillon - vey class in @xmath9 ( proportional to the are of the polygon ) .",
    "this relation is very strict , i.e. if we change the casson handle then we must change the polygon .",
    "but that changes the foliation and vice verse .",
    "finally we obtained the result : + _ the exotic @xmath0 ( of bizaca ) is determined by the codimension-1 foliations with non - vanishing godbillon - vey class in @xmath56 of a 3-sphere seen as submanifold @xmath57 .",
    "we say : the exoticness is localized at a 3-sphere inside the small exotic @xmath0 . _",
    "in this section , we will describe the direct reference of 4-dimensional structures to the dynamics of special higher dimensional branes , the d6-brane , in flat spacetime .",
    "this d6-brane is usually involved in building various , , realistic ",
    "4-dimensional models derived from brane configurations .",
    "we will analyze this case separately along with the discussion of compactifications in string theory in a forthcoming paper .",
    "let us consider the d6-brane of iia string theory in flat 10 dimensional spacetime and assume a vanishing b - field .",
    "the world - volumes of flat dp - branes are classified by @xmath58 where this k - homology group is understood as @xmath59 .",
    "then there is the isomorphism @xmath60 between the k - groups induced by the isomorphism of the reduced @xmath5 algebra of functions @xmath61 . their charges , constraining the dynamics of the brane ,",
    "are dually described by @xmath62 . in the case of the d6-branes ,",
    "the group @xmath63 classifies the rr charges of flat d6-branes in flat 10-dimensional spacetime @xcite .    in case of a non - vanishing _",
    "b_-field for a stable d6-brane , the _",
    "b_-field needs be non - trivial on the space @xmath64 transversal to the world - volume ( on the brane we have @xmath65 ) .",
    "hence the _ b_-field must be nontrivial on the space @xmath8 .",
    "it is convienient to adopt ( see @xcite , p. 654 ) the definition of @xmath7 - field on a manifold @xmath66 as a class of gerbe ( with connection ) , which referes directly to the topologically non - trivial @xmath11 classes instead of local 2-form @xmath7 :    a @xmath7-field @xmath67 is a gerbe with one - connection over @xmath66 and characteristic class @xmath68\\in h^{3}(x , z)$ ] which is an nsns h - flux .",
    "then the classification of d6-brane charges in iia type superstring theory in flat space is influenced by the presence of non - trivial b - field and now is given by the twisted k - theory @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 with @xmath71=k\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "hence the dynamics of d6-branes in type iia superstring theory on flat spacetime is influenced by a non - zero b - field .",
    "following our philosophy already implicitly present in our previous work , the source of the non - trivial _",
    "b_-field on @xmath8 ( hence @xmath72 ) is the exoticness of the ambient @xmath0 .",
    "this result is motivated by our work that some ( small ) exotic @xmath73 s correspond to non - trivial classes @xmath68\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] and conversely , where @xmath8 is part of the boundary of the akbulut cork @xcite . moreover",
    ", exotic smoothness of @xmath73 twists the k - theory groups @xmath74 @xcite where the 3-sphere @xmath8 lies at the boundary of the akbulut cork .",
    "hence the dynamics induced by d6-branes in the spacetime @xmath75 is equivalent to the dynamics induced by a d6-brane with a non - zero b - field on the transversal @xmath64 compactified to @xmath8 . finally we get :    rr charges of d6-branes in string theory iia in the presence of a non - trivial b - field ( @xmath72 ) , ( these charges are classified by @xmath69 , and @xmath68\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] ) , are related to exotic smoothness of small @xmath73 .",
    "this exotic @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath68 $ ] which twists @xmath76 @xcite , where @xmath57 lies at the boundary of the akbulut cork and @xmath8 is transverse to the branes .",
    "thus , changing the smoothness of @xmath0 gives rise to the change of the allowed charges for d6 branes inducing a change of the dynamics .",
    "we saw that the geometric realization of ( classical ) d - branes in certain backgrounds of string theory is correlated with small exotic @xmath0 s which can be all embedded in the standard smooth @xmath0 . as was shown in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "quantum d - branes correspond to the net of exotic smooth @xmath0 s embedded in certain exotic smooth @xmath0 .",
    "an intriguing interpretation for this correspondence can be given by : _ in some limit of iia superstring theory , small exotic smooth @xmath0 s can be considered as carrying the rr charges of d6 branes_. a generalization of this concept will be studied in the next section .",
    "in the usual definition of dp - branes , one considers embedded @xmath1-dimensional objects in some higher - dimensional space . in the presence of ns - ns h - fluxes , curved ( twisted ) classical branes",
    "are defined still as submanifolds with some extra topological condition ( cancelling the anomaly ) ( see @xcite , def . 1.14 , p. 654 ) :    twisted d - brane in a @xmath7-field @xmath67 is a triple @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a closed , embedded oriented submanifold with @xmath81 , and @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the third stiefel - whithney class of the normal bundle of @xmath19 in @xmath66 , @xmath84 .",
    "this case of non - trivial h - flux directly referes to the non - commutative geometry tools hence quantum d - branes are considered naturally here @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that in the presence of a topologically non - trivial @xmath7-field world - volumes of d - branes are rather described as noncommutative spaces in conne s sense .",
    "we try to find a topological characterisation for d - branes as a kind of embedding also in the quantum regime .",
    "these branes emerge in case of the non - trivial h - flux too , and we call them _ topological quantum branes_. however the reason for the existence of this h - flux is deeply rooted in the geometry of some exotic @xmath0",
    ". exotic @xmath0 itself referes to non - commutative spaces and tools from non - commutative geometry , which can be seen as one reasons behind the quantum description of topological branes .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the charges of d - branes are given by some ( twisted ) k - theory classes also related to ( twisted ) cohomology . in case of a d6-brane ,",
    "the charge is classified by the twisted k - theory @xmath69 with @xmath68\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] ( ech 3-cocycle ) .",
    "therefore one has a 3-sphere determinig the charge of a 6-dimensional object . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we will compactify the ( possible ) infinite d6-brane to a 6-sphere @xmath85 in the following .",
    "now we start with a short discussion of embeddings @xmath86 as an example @xmath87 of a general map @xmath88 to understand the charge classification .",
    "as haefliger @xcite showed , the isotopy classes of these embeddings are determined by the integer classes ( hopf invariant ) in @xmath11 .",
    "thus the @xmath89 space is knotted in the @xmath78 space .",
    "this phenomenon depends strongly on smoothness , i.e. it disappears for continuous or pl embeddings .",
    "usually every @xmath90sphere or every homology @xmath90sphere unknots ( in pl or top ) in @xmath91 for @xmath92 , i.e. for codimension @xmath93 or higher .",
    "of course , one has the usual knotting phenomena in codimension @xmath94 and the codimension @xmath95 was shown to be unique for embeddings @xmath96 ( for @xmath97 ) but is hard to solve in other cases .",
    "let @xmath98 be an embedding of a homology 3-sphere @xmath99 ( containing the case @xmath8 ) .",
    "then the normal bundle of @xmath100 is trivial ( definition of an embedding ) and homotopy classes of trivialisations of the normal bundle ( normal framings ) are classified by the homotopy classes @xmath101 $ ] with respect to some fixed framing .",
    "there is an isomorphism @xmath101=[\\sigma , s^{2}]$ ] ( so - called pontrjagin - thom construction ) and @xmath102 $ ] can be identified with @xmath103 .",
    "that is one possible way to get the classification of isotopy classes of embeddings @xmath98 by elements of @xmath103 . a class @xmath68 $ ] in @xmath104 determines via an injective homomorphism a ( derham-)cocycle @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath2 is the field strength for the b - field then the 3-form @xmath2 must be a multiply of the volume form on @xmath99 and we have@xmath106 by the usual pairing between homology and cohomology . by the cellular approximation theorem ,",
    "the elements in @xmath104 are determined by @xmath11 .",
    "combined with our result that @xmath11 determines some exotic @xmath0 we have shown :    ( the topological origins of the allowed d6-brane charges )    [ theo : d6-brane - charge ]    let @xmath73 be some exotic @xmath0 determined by some 3-form @xmath2 , i.e. by a codimension-1 foliation on the boundary @xmath51 of the akbulut cork @xmath27 .",
    "the codimension-1 foliation on @xmath51 is determined by @xmath107 .",
    "each integer class in @xmath108 determines the isotopy class of an embedding @xmath109 .",
    "hence , the group of allowed charges of d6-branes in the presence of b - field @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath110 is determined equivalently by the isotopy classes of embeddings @xmath109 .",
    "the classes of @xmath2-field are topologically determined by the isotopy classes of the embeddings , which affects the allowed charges of d6-branes .",
    "but more is true . given two embeddings @xmath111 between two homology 3-spheres @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "a homology cobordism is a cobordism between @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this cobordism can be embedded in @xmath116 $ ] determining the homology bordism class of the embedding . then",
    "two embeddings of an oriented homology 3-sphere in @xmath85 are isotopic if and only if they are homology bordant .",
    "in this section we try to give a geometric approach to quantm d - branes using wild embeddings of trivial complexes into @xmath4 or @xmath15 .",
    "this point of view is supported by the theorem [ theo : d6-brane - charge ] above . here",
    "we will describe a dimension - independent way : every wild embedding @xmath117 of a @xmath118dimensional complex @xmath119 into the @xmath90dimensional sphere @xmath4 is determined by the fundamental group @xmath120 of the complement .",
    "this group is perfect and uniquely representable by a 2-dimensional complex , a singular disk or grope ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as we showed in @xcite , the exotic @xmath0 is related to a grope .",
    "thus , these constructed _ topological quantum _",
    "d - branes are determined by exotic @xmath0 s which act as a kind of germ for the branes .",
    "we call a map @xmath121 between two topological manifolds an embedding if @xmath122 and @xmath123 are homeomorphic to each other . from the differential - topological point of view ,",

    "otherwise we call the embedding _ wild_. there are famous wild embeddings like alexanders horned sphere or antoine s necklace . in physics",
    "one uses mostly tame embeddings but as cannon mentioned in his overview @xcite , one needs wild embeddings to understand the tame one . as shown by us",
    "@xcite , wild embeddings are needed to understand exotic smoothness . as explained in @xcite by cannon , tameness is strongly connected to another topic : decomposition theory ( see the book @xcite ) .",

    "if only the first two conditions can be fulfilled then one call it concordance .",
    "embeddings are usually classified by isotopy .",
    "an important example is the embedding @xmath135 , known as knot , where different knots are different isotopy classes .",
    "wild embeddings are important to understand usual embeddings . consider a closed curve in the plane . by common sense",
    ", this curve divides the plane into an interior and an exterior area .",
    "the jordan curve theorem agrees with that view completely .",
    "but what about one dimension higher , i.e. consider the embedding @xmath136 ?",
    "alexander was the first who constructed a counterexample , alexanders horned sphere @xcite , as wild embedding @xmath137 .",

    "the fundamental group @xmath184 of the complement @xmath185 is a superperfect group , i.e. @xmath163 is identical to its commutator subgroup @xmath186 $ ] ( then @xmath187 and @xmath166 .",
    "this group is not finite in case of a wild embedding . here",
    "we use gropes to represent @xmath163 geometrically . the idea behind",
    "that approach is very simple : the fundamental group of the 2-diemsional torus @xmath188 is the abelian group @xmath189=aba^{-1}b^{-1}=e\\right\\rangle = \\mathbb{z}\\oplus\\mathbb{z}$ ] generated by the two standard slopes @xmath190 corresponding to the commuting generators of @xmath191 .",
    "the capped torus @xmath192 has an additional element @xmath193 in the fundamental group generated by the boundary @xmath194 .",

    ", we have the same problem : every element @xmath193 is generated by the commuator @xmath148 $ ] of two other elements @xmath190 which are also represented by commutators etc .",
    "thus one obtains a hierarchical object , a generalized 2-disk or a grope ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grope ] ) .",
    ", height=302 ]    now we describe two ways to associate a @xmath180algebra to this grope .",
    "this first approach uses a combination of our previous papers @xcite",
    ". then every grope determines a codimension-1 foliation of the 3-sphere and vice versa .",
    "the leaf - space of this foliation is a factor @xmath196 von neumann algebra and we have a @xmath180algebra for the holonomy groupoid . for later usage ,",
    "we need a more direct way to construct a @xmath180algebra from a wild embedding or grope .",
    "the main ingredient is the superperfect group @xmath163 , countable generated but not finitely presented group @xmath163 .    given a grope @xmath197 representing via @xmath198 the ( superperfect ) group @xmath163 .",
    "now we define the @xmath180algebra @xmath199 ) associated to the grope @xmath197 with group @xmath163 .",
    "the basic elements of this algebra are smooth half - densities with compact supports on @xmath197 , @xmath200 , where @xmath201 for @xmath202 is the one - dimensional complex vector space of maps from the exterior power @xmath203 , of the union of levels @xmath204 representing @xmath205 to @xmath206 such that @xmath207 for @xmath208 , the convolution product @xmath209 is given by the equality@xmath210=\\gamma}f(\\gamma_{1})g(\\gamma_{2})\\ ] ] then we define via @xmath211 a @xmath212operation making @xmath213 into a @xmath212algebra . for each capped torus @xmath214 in some level of the grope @xmath197 , one has a natural representation of @xmath213 on the @xmath215 space over @xmath214 .",

    "we introduce the notion of isotopy classes for embeddings . given two embeddings @xmath126 with a special map @xmath127\\to m\\times[0,1]$ ] as deformation of @xmath241 into @xmath242 , then both embeddings are isotopic to each other .",

    "thus , the isotopy class of the wild embedding @xmath241 is completely determined by the @xmath244 up to homotopy . using connes work on operator algebras of foliation , our construction of the @xmath180algebra for a wild embedding is functorial , i.e. an isotopy of the embeddings induces an isomorphism between the corresponding @xmath180algebras . given two non - isotopic , wild embeddings",
    "then we have a homomorphism between the @xmath180algebras only . but",
    "every homomorphism ( which is not a isomorphism ) between @xmath180algebras @xmath249 gives an element of @xmath250 and vice versa .",

    "given a wild embedding @xmath254 with @xmath180algebra @xmath255 and group @xmath256 . in this section",
    "we will derive an action for this embedding to derive the d - brane action in the classical limit .",
    "the starting point is our remark above ( see section [ sec : small - exotic - r4-gropes ] ) that the group @xmath163 can be geometrically constructed by using a grope @xmath197 with @xmath257 .",
    "this grope was used to construct a codimension-1 foliation on the 3-sphere classified by the godbillon - vey invariant .",
    "this class can be seen as element of @xmath258 with the holonomy groupoid @xmath223 of the foliation .",
    "the strong relation between the grope @xmath197 and the foliation gives an isomorphism for the @xmath180algebra which can be easily verified by using the definitions of both algebras . as shown by connes @xcite , the godbillon - vey class @xmath259 can be expressed as cyclic cohomology class ( the so - called flow of weights)@xmath260 of the @xmath180algebra for the foliation isomorphic to the @xmath180algebra for the grope @xmath197 .",
    "then we define an expression@xmath261 uniquely associated to the wild embedding ( @xmath262 is the dixmier trace ) .",
    "@xmath263 is the action of the embedding . because of the invariance for the class @xmath264 , the variation of @xmath263 vanishes if the map @xmath241 is a wild embedding . but",
    "this expression is not satisfactory and can not be used to get the classical limit .",
    "for that purpose we consider the representation of the group @xmath163 into the group @xmath230 of elementary matrices . as mentioned above , @xmath163 is countable generated and the generators can be arranged in the embeddings space .",
    "then we obtain matrix - valued functions @xmath265 as the image of the generators of @xmath163 w.r.t .",
    "the representation @xmath266 labelled by the dimension @xmath267 of the embedding space @xmath4 . via the representation @xmath268",
    ", we obtain a cyclic cocycle in @xmath269 generated by a suitable fredholm operator @xmath100 . here",
    "we use the standard choice @xmath270 with the dirac operator @xmath271 acting on the functions in @xmath272 .",
    "then the cocycle in @xmath269 can be expressed by@xmath273[f , x^{\\nu}]\\ ] ] using a metric @xmath274 in @xmath4 via the pull - back using the representation @xmath268 .",
    "finally we obtain the action@xmath275[f , x_{\\mu}])=tr_{\\omega}([d , x^{\\mu}][d , x_{\\mu}]|d|^{-2})\\label{eq : quantum - d - brane - action}\\ ] ] which can be evaluated by using the heat - kernel of the dirac operator @xmath271 .",
    "similar to the case of the von neumann algebra of a foliation , the non - commutativity of the @xmath180algebra @xmath255 is induced by the wild embedding @xmath254 .",
    "the complexity of the group @xmath256 is related to the complexity of the @xmath180algebra constructed above .",
    "therefore a tame embedding has a trivial group @xmath163 and we obtain for the @xmath180algebra @xmath276 , i.e. every operator is a multiplication operator ( multiplication with a complex number ) .    from the physical point of view , the non - triviality of the @xmath180algebra has an interpretation ( via the gns representation ) as the observables algebra of a quantum system . in our case ,",
    "the non - triviality of the @xmath180algebra is connected with the wildness of the embedding or the wild embedding is connected with a quantum system .",
    "but then the classical limit is equivalent to choose a tame embedding @xmath254 of a @xmath118dimensional complex @xmath119 . the dirac operator @xmath271 on @xmath119 acts on usual square - integrable functions , so that @xmath277=dx^{\\mu}$ ] is finite .",
    "the action ( [ eq : quantum - d - brane - action ] ) reduces to @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the index for the coordinates on @xmath4 and @xmath280 represents the index of the complex . from the physical point",
    "we expect to obtain an action which describes the embedding of the brane . for that purpose , we will choose a small fluctuation @xmath281 of a fixed embedding given by @xmath282 with @xmath283 .",
    "then we obtain@xmath284 and we use a standard argument to neglect the terms linear in @xmath285 : the fluktuation have no prefered direction and therefore only the square contributes",
    ". then we have @xmath286 for the action . by using a result of @xcite one",
    "obtains for the dixmier trace@xmath287 with the first coefficient @xmath288 of the heat kernel expansion @xcite@xmath289 and the action simplifies to@xmath290 for the main contributions where @xmath291 is the scalar curvature of @xmath119 ( for @xmath292 ) .",
    "usually we can assume a non - vanishing scalar curvature .",
    "furthermore we can scale the fluctuation to get the action@xmath293 for some number @xmath294 proportional to @xmath291 .",
    "it is known that this action agrees with the usual ( born - infeld ) action@xmath295 of flat @xmath118branes ( @xmath296 for @xmath297 ( i.e.@xmath298 ) with vanishing @xmath299field thus we obtain a ( quantum ) d - brane action by using wild embeddings for the description of a quantum d - brane and the flux @xmath2 represented by the wild embedding @xmath3 .",
    "these data , in the classical limit , reduce to the bi action for flat d@xmath1-brane .",
    "we will further investigate this point in a separate paper .",
    "the argumentation above can be simply resummed by the following arguments :    1 .   given an embedding @xmath300 of a @xmath118complex @xmath119 into a @xmath90sphere .",
    "this embedding is wild , if the complement @xmath301 is non - simple connected , i.e. the fundamental group @xmath302 does not vanish .",
    "we define a topological quantum @xmath118brane as the wild embedding @xmath241 .",
    "4 .   the fundamental group @xmath256 is a perfect group , i.e. purely generated by the commutators @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "this group can be geometrically represented by a 2-complex , called a generalized disk or grope .",
    "6 .   from this grope @xmath197",
    "we constructed a non - trivial @xmath180algebra @xmath303 .",
    "non - trivial @xmath7-field @xmath304 is represented by the wild embedding @xmath3 .",
    "the grope is a 2-complex sometimes equipped with an embedding into the euclidean space @xmath305 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , one can also use it to describe small exotic @xmath0 s ( see also some details in section [ sec : small - exotic - r4-gropes ] ) . at the first view we have two possible interpretations , the 2-dimensional grope and the 4-dimensional exotic @xmath0 , which are rather independent of each other .",
    "but in the derivation of the action above , we used implicitly the result that an exotic @xmath0 ( and the grope constructed from it ) is ( partly ) classified by the godbillon - vey invariant .",
    "therefore our topological quantum d - brane is generated by a small exotic @xmath0 too .",
    "every small exotic @xmath0 is a very rich many - facets hybrid object which links , among others , @xmath5 convolution algebras , k - theory , foliations and topology in particular .",
    "it can also be represented by a wild embedding @xmath306 @xcite . when @xmath0 is taken with its standard smooth structure",
    ", hence smoothness agrees with product topology , then all complexities of the structures disappear . in this paper",
    "we argue that exotic @xmath0 s are involved in the formalism of string theory also at the non - perturbative domains where branes are considered as quantum objects .",
    "especially , exotic @xmath0 s determine a class of topological quantum d@xmath1-branes .",
    "on the other hand the persented results support our conjecture from @xcite , stating that : + _ the exotic small @xmath0 lies at the heart of quantum gravity in dimension 4 . especially it is a quantized object . _ + the connections between 4-exotics and ns and d - branes in various string backgrounds were given in @xcite and then extended formally to the quantum regime of d - branes @xcite . here we further extend this relation and propose a topological mechanism generating classes of branes and charges in some backgrounds .",
    "we study the case of quantum d - branes using @xmath180algebras .",
    "the topological mechanism behind quantum branes is the wild embedding of 2-spheres into @xmath8 as well @xmath8 into higher dimensional spheres .",
    "these last embeddings generate d - branes which are considered as _",
    "topological quantum d - branes _ whereas the non - trivial class , @xmath2 , or @xmath7-field , is derived from the first wild embedding , i.e. @xmath3 . the presented mechanism generates quantum topological d@xmath1-branes when the non - trivial @xmath7-field on @xmath8 is given as a ( quantum ) wild embedding . on the other hand classical branes",
    "are considered as submanifolds or k - homology cycles . in case of the quantum regime",
    "they are usually described as k - theory classes on separable @xmath5-algebras @xcite .",

    "this follows in particular from the reduction of the quantum action to bi action .",
    "the results can be roughly summarized by : + _ the exotic small @xmath0 as described by codimension-1 foliations on the 3-sphere is the germ of wide range of effects on d - branes .",
