    "although molecular properties can sometimes be evaluated with sufficient accuracy based on an mcscf - type approach , an mcscf or cascsf calculation will often only be a first step to obtain a reference configuration space and molecular orbital ( mo ) basis , which already takes into account important static correlation effects of the valence electrons . in a subsequent step ,",
    "multi - reference approaches such as multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) or perturbation theory ( for example , complete active space second - order perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) @xcite ) , can be employed to recover dynamical electron correlation .    in the casscf",

    "by contrast , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach @xcite in quantum chemistry @xcite  is capable of approximating cas - type wave functions to chemical accuracy with polynomial scaling . in combination with a self - consistent - field orbital optimization ansatz ( dmrg - scf ) @xcite , active orbital spaces of about five to six times",
    "the casscf limit are accessible .",
    "the selection of a suitable active orbital space is a tedious procedure , but may be automatized@xcite .    given a pre - defined active orbital space , present dmrg - scf algortihms can be divided up into two conceptually different approaches .",
    "the first approach @xcite exploits the generalized brillouin theorem @xcite where orbital changes are obtained from the coefficients of a so - called super - ci procedure @xcite consisting of the dmrg - scf wave function and all brillouin singly excited configurations .",
    "such an orbital - optimization scheme is implemented in many popular quantum chemical packages , for example , in molcas @xcite and orca @xcite .",
    "moreover , dmrg in combination with canonical transformation theory @xcite based on a unitary transformation operator which contains only terms for single excitations in its exponential form , also belongs to this category .",
    "the convergence behavior of the super - ci algorithm is quite robust although it is not a quadratically convergent algorithm@xcite .",
    "the second class of dmrg - scf approaches focuses on a direct minimization of the energy .",
    "this _ ansatz _  was first exploited for dmrg - scf in the [ augmented hessian ( ah ) ] newton - raphson - like ( nr ) implementation by wouters _",
    "@xcite as well as by ma and ma @xcite   who presented a pilot dmrg - scf implementation of the werner - meyer ( wm ) mcscf algorithm@xcite .",
    "their common basis is the construction of operators which are obtained from taking the first and second derivatives of the energy with respect to the variational parameters .    in the nr algorithm and its ah form@xcite ,",
    "the energy expression is chosen to be a second - order function of the orbital rotation parameters and the changes in the wave function expansion coefficients@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the wm algorithm employs a second - order energy expression which is periodic in the orbital changes and contains higher - order terms in the orbitals rotation parameters@xcite .",
    "this ensures a large convergence radius even for ill - conditioned starting configurations , where the hessian ( the matrix of second derivatives with respect to the variational parameters ) exhibits a large number of negative eigenvalues@xcite .    a distinct feature of the energy - based orbital - optimization algorithms is the possibility to take into account coupling terms between the single- and many - particle - basis parameters to simultaneously update the wave function and orbitals@xcite .",
    "their calculation requires for either approach , nr , ah , or wm , access to derivatives of the one- and two - particle reduced density matrices ( rdms ) , i.e. , symmetrized transition density matrices . in this work ,",
    "we employ the matrix product state ( mps ) and matrix product operator ( mpo ) formalism which allows us to calculate the rdm derivatives in a straightforward fashion . from them",
    ", we construct the coupling terms in the hessian for a simultaneous update of the wave function and orbital parameters@xcite .",
    "moreover , as proposed by werner and knowles @xcite , it is also possible to avoid the calculation of the rdm derivatives by introducing the coupling for the wm - based optimization algorithm through solving a set of coupled nonlinear equations employing a second - order hamiltonian expression@xcite .",
    "we therefore pursued this approach and studied different approximations to obtain a relaxed mps with respect to changes in the mo basis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : on the basis of the work of werner , meyer , and knowles ( wmk)@xcite , the central element of our algorithm is the coupled optimization of the mps and mos to obtain a quadratically convergent dmrg - scf approach . in section",
    "[ sec : wmk ] , we outline our orbital - optimization approach for mps wave functions and discuss possibilities for a simultaneous optimization of the mps(s ) and mos in section [ sec : simulopt ] ) .",
    "since one of these coupling approaches requires an evaluation of the first derivative of the one- and two - particle rdms with respect to the variational parameters , we illustrate their derivation within the mps framework in section [ sec : rdmder ] .",

    "in passing , we note that we may further exploit the matrix - product formulation to express an operator @xmath16  in mpo form @xcite @xmath17 with incoming and outgoing physical states @xmath18  and @xmath19 respectively , and the virtual indices @xmath20  and @xmath21 . in complete analogy to eq .",
