    "the treatment of boundary problems in symbolic computation was initiated in the phd thesis  @xcite under the guidance of bruno buchberger in cooperation with heinz engl ; see also  @xcite and for the further development  @xcite .",

    ", we have always assumed differential equations without singularity or , equivalently , monic differential operators ( leading coefficient function being unity ) . in this paper",
    ", we develop for the first time an _ algebraic theory _ for treating boundary problems with a ( mild ) _ singularity at one endpoint_. for details , we refer to section  [ sec : bp - one - sing ] .",
    "our approach is very different from the traditional analysis setting in terms of the weyl - titchmarsh theory ( limit points and limit circles ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore the connections between our approach and the classical treatment ; however , this must be left for future work .",
    "regarding the general setup of the _ algebraic language for boundary problems _ , we refer to the references mentioned above , in particular  @xcite . at this point ,",
    "let us just recall some notation .",
    "we start from a fixed integro - differential algebra  @xmath2 .",
    "the formulation of ( local ) boundary conditions is in terms of _ evaluations _ , which are by definition multiplicative linear functionals in  @xmath3 .",
    "we write  @xmath4 if  @xmath5 is a _ subspace _ of  @xmath6 ; the same notation is used for subspaces of the dual space  @xmath3 .",
    "orthogonal _ of a subspace  @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 and similarly for the orthogonal of a subspace  @xmath9 .",
    "we write  @xmath10 $ ] for the _ linear span _ of ( possibly infinitely many ) elements  @xmath11 ; the same notation is used for linear spans within  @xmath3 .",
    "the _ zero vector space _ of any dimension is denoted by  @xmath12 .",
    "we write @xmath13 for the _ falling factorial _ , where  @xmath14 could be arbitrary ( but will be an integer for our purposes ) while  @xmath15 is taken to be a natural number .",
    "note that  @xmath16 for  @xmath17 .",
    "our main example of an integro - differential algebra will be the space  @xmath18 of analytic functions on a closed interval  @xmath19 $ ] . recall that by definition this is the space of functions that are analytic in some open set containing  @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the development of the new algebraic theory of two - point boundary problems with a mild singularity ( whose treatment is really just broached in this paper ) was triggered by a collaboration between a _ symbolic computation _ team ( consisting of the first , second and fourth author ) and a researcher in _ engineering mechancs _ ( the third author ) .",
    "this underlines the importance and fruitfulness of collaborations between theoretical developments and practical applications .",
    "we present the example that had originally led to this research in section  [ sec : appl ] .    from a methodological point of view",
    ", this research on the symbolic algorithm for linear boundary value problems has particular relevance and is drawing from the theorema project , see @xcite .",
    "this project aims at supporting a new paradigm for doing ( algorithmic ) mathematical research : in the phase of doing research on new theorems and algorithms , th@xmath0orem@xmath1  provides a formal language ( a version of predicate logic ) and an automated reasoning system by which the exploration of the theory is supported . in the phase in which algorithms based on the new theory should be implemented and used in computing examples , th@xmath0orem@xmath1  allows to program and execute the algorithms _ in the same language_. in the particular case of our approach to solving linear boundary value problems , the fundamental theorem on which the approach is based was proved automatically by checking that the rewrite rules for integro - differential operators forms a grbner basis . in a second step ,",
    "the algorithm for solving linear boundary value problems is expressed again in the th@xmath0orem@xmath1language and can then be called by the users by inputting the linear boundary value problems in a user - friendly notation .    in its current version",
    ", the engine for solving boundary problems is bundled in the ` greengroebner `  package of th@xmath0orem@xmath1 . as an example , consider the boundary problem @xmath21 which we shall consider in greater detail in section  [ sec : simple - example ] .",
    "this can be given to th@xmath0orem@xmath1  in the form @xmath22\\ ] ] leading either to the solution for @xmath23 as @xmath24\\,\\mathbf{d}\\xi - x^2 \\int_0^x f[\\xi]\\,\\mathbf{d}\\xi - x^2 \\int_0 ^ 1 \\xi^2 f[\\xi]\\,\\mathbf{d}\\xi + \\int_0^x \\xi^2 f[\\xi]\\,\\mathbf{d}\\xi \\right)}\\ ] ] or to the green s function @xmath25 as @xmath26 at the user s request .",
    "in addition to the ` greengroebner `  package in th@xmath0orem@xmath1 , a maple package named ` intdiffop ` is also available  @xcite .",
    "this package was developed in the frame of anja korporal s phd thesis , supervised by georg regensburger and the first author .",
    "the maple package supports also generalized boundary problems ( see section  [ sec : simple - example ] for their relevance to this paper ) .",
    "one advantage of the th@xmath0orem@xmath1  system is that both the research phase and the application phase of our method can be formulated and supported within the same logic and software system  which we consider to be quite a novel and promising paradigm for the future .",
    "for illustrating the new ideas , it is illuminating to look at a simple example that exhibits the kind of phenomena that we have to cope with in the kirchhoff plate boundary problem .    [",
    "ex : simple - example ] let us start with the _ intuitive but mathematically unprecise _ statement of the following example : given a `` suitable '' forcing function  @xmath27 on the unit interval  @xmath28 $ ] , we want to find a `` reasonable '' solution function  @xmath29 such that @xmath30 but note that the differential operator  @xmath31 is singular at the left boundary point  @xmath32 of the interval  @xmath33 under consideration .",
    "hence the first boundary condition  @xmath34 should be looked at with some suspicion . and what function space are we supposed to consider in the first place ? if the  @xmath35 and  @xmath36 are to be taken literally , the space  @xmath37 $ ] will clearly not do . on the other hand ,",
    "we need functions that are smooth ( or at least continuous ) at  @xmath32 to make sense of  @xmath38 .    in the rest of this section , we shall give one possible solution to the dilemma outlined above .",
    "of course we could resort to using different function space for  @xmath29 and  @xmath27 , and this is in fact the approach one usually takes in analysis . for our present purposes ,",
    "however , we prefer to keep the simple paradigm of integro - differential algebras as outlined in section  [ sec : intro ] , but we shall modify it to accommodate singularities such as in  @xmath35 and  @xmath36 . note that these are just poles , so we can take  @xmath39 to be the subring of the field  @xmath40 consisting of complex - valued _ meromorphic functions _ that are regular at all  @xmath41 except possibly  @xmath32 . in other words , these are functions that have a laurent expansion at  @xmath32 with finite principal part , converging in a complex annulus  @xmath42 with  @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , we will only use the real part  @xmath44 \\setminus \\{0\\}$ ] of this annulus .",
    "note that we have of course  @xmath45 .",
    "the ring  @xmath39 is an integro - differential algebra over  @xmath46 if we use the standard _",
    "derivation _",
    "@xmath47 and the _ rota - baxter operator _",
    "@xmath48 initialized at the regular point  @xmath49 .",
    "we have now ensured that the differential operator of   has a clear algebraic interpretation  @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "however , the boundary condition  @xmath34 is still dubious . for making it precise , note that the integro - differential algebra  @xmath2 has only the second of the two boundary evaluations  @xmath51 with  @xmath52 and  @xmath53 in the usual sense of a total function",
    "so while we can interpret the second boundary condition algebraically by  @xmath54 , the same does not work on the left endpoint . instead of an evaluation at",
    "@xmath32 we shall introduce the map @xmath55 that extracts the _",
    "principal part _ of a function written in terms of its laurent expansion at  @xmath32 . here and",
    "henceforth we assume such expansions of nonzero functions are written with  @xmath56 . if  @xmath57 the function is regular at  @xmath32 , and the above sum is to be understood as zero . clearly , @xmath58 is a linear projector , with the complementary projector  @xmath59 extracting the _ regular part _ at  @xmath32 .",
    "incidentially , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are also rota - baxter operators of weight  @xmath62 , which play a crucial role in the renormalization theory of perturbative quantum field theory  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1.10 ) .",
    "finally , we define the functional  @xmath63 that extracts the _ constant term _",
    "@xmath64 of a meromorphic function expanded at  @xmath32 . combining  @xmath65 with the monomial multiplication operators , we obtain the coefficient functionals  @xmath66 that map  @xmath67 to  @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , the residue functional is given by  @xmath69 .",
    "note that for functions regular at  @xmath32 , the functional  @xmath65 coincides with the evaluation at the left endpoint , @xmath70 .",
    "however , for general meromorphic functions , @xmath71 is undefined and @xmath65 is _ not multiplicative _ since for example  @xmath72 .",
    "hence we refer to  @xmath65 only as a functional but not as an evaluation .",
    "we can now make the boundary condition  @xmath73 precise for our setting over  @xmath39 .",
    "what we really mean is that  @xmath74 , where  @xmath75 is the projector that extracts the principal part together with the constant term . extending the algebraic notion of boundary problem to allow for boundary conditions that are not functionals",
    ", we may thus view   as  @xmath76^\\perp})$ ] . in this way we have given a precise meaning to the _ formulation of the boundary problem_.    but",
    "how are we to go about its _ solution _ in a systematic manner ?",
    "let us first look at the adhoc _ standard method _ way of doing this  determining the general homogeneous solution , then add the inhomogeneous solution via variation of constants , and finally adapt the integration constants to accommodate the boundary conditions . in our case , one sees immediately that  @xmath77 $ ] so that the general solution of the homogeneous differential equation is  @xmath78 , where  @xmath79 are integration constants .",
    "variation of constants  @xcite then yields @xmath80 for the inhomogeneous solution .",
    "note that  @xmath81 may also have singularities as  @xmath32 or any other point  @xmath82 apart from  @xmath49 .",
    "now we need to impose the _",
    "boundary conditions_. from  @xmath83 we obtain immediately  @xmath84 . for the boundary condition at  @xmath32 we have to proceed a bit more cautiously , obtaining @xmath85 where we assume that  @xmath27 is regular at  @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that the remaining limit can only exist if the integral tends to a finite limit as  @xmath87 , and this is the case by our assumption on  @xmath27 .",
    "but then we may apply the boundary condition to obtain  @xmath88 .",
    "this gives the overall solution @xmath89 which one may write in the standard form  @xmath90 where the _ green s function _ is defined as @xmath91 in the usual manner .",
    "how are we to make sense of this in an algebraic way , i.e. without ( explicit ) use of limits and hence topology ?",
    "the key to this lies in the projector  @xmath60 and the functional  @xmath71 , which serve to distill into our algebraic setting what we need from the topology ( namely  @xmath92 as @xmath87 ) .",
    "however , there is another complication when compared to boundary problems without singularities as presented in section  [ sec : intro ] : we can not expect a solution  @xmath93 to   for every given forcing function  @xmath81 .",
    "in other words , this boundary problem is _ not regular _ in the sense of  @xcite .    in the past",
    ", we have also used the term _ singular boundary problem _ for such situations ( here this seems to be suitable in a double sense but we shall be careful to separate the second sense by sticking to the designation `` boundary problems with singularities '' ) .",
    "the theory of singular boundary problems was developed in an abstract setting in  @xcite ; applications to boundary problems ( without singularities ) have been presented in  @xcite . at this point",
    "we shall only recall a few basic facts .",
    "a boundary problem  @xmath94 is called _ semi - regular _ if  @xmath95 .",
    "it is easy to see that the boundary problem  @xmath96^\\perp})$ ] is in fact semi - regular .",
    "since any  @xmath97 can be written as  @xmath78 , the condition  @xmath54 implies  @xmath98 and hence  @xmath99 .",
    "but then  @xmath100 forces  @xmath101 and hence  @xmath102 .    if  @xmath76^\\perp})$ ] were a regular boundary problem , we would have  @xmath103^\\perp } = { \\mathcal{f}}$ ]",
    "however , it is easy to see that there are elements  @xmath93 that do not belong to  @xmath104^\\perp}$ ] , for example  @xmath105 .",
    "hence we conclude that the boundary problem   is in fact overdetermined . for such boundary problems",
    "@xmath94 one can always select a _ regular subproblem _",
    "@xmath106 , in the sense that  @xmath107 . in our case ,",
    "a natural choice is  @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "this is regular since the evaluation matrix @xmath109 is regular , and the associated kernel projector is  @xmath110 by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "a.1 ) .    for making the boundary problem   well - defined on  @xmath39",
    "we need one more ingredient : we have to fix a complement  @xmath111 of  @xmath112 , the so - called _ exceptional space_. intuitively speaking ,",
    "this comprises the `` exceptional functions '' of  @xmath39 that we decide to discard in order to render   solvable .",
    "let us first work out what  @xmath113 looks like .",
    "since  @xmath114 forces the principal part and constant term to vanish , we may start from  @xmath115 , with the additional proviso that  @xmath116 .",
    "applying  @xmath117 to this  @xmath23 yields  @xmath118 , which represents an arbitrary element of  @xmath119^\\perp}$ ] for a suitable choice of coefficients  @xmath120 since the additional condition  @xmath116 can always be met by choosing  @xmath121 .",
    "but then it is very natural to choose  @xmath122^\\perp}$ ] as the required complement",

    "green s operator _ of a generalized boundary problem  @xmath124 is given by  @xmath125 , where  @xmath126 is the green s operator of some regular subproblem  @xmath106 and  @xmath127 is the projector onto  @xmath112 along  @xmath111 . in our case ,",
    "the latter projector is clearly  @xmath128 , while the green s operator  @xmath129 by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "26 ) , with the kernel projector  @xmath130 as above and the fundamental right inverse  @xmath131 given according to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "23 ) by @xmath132 which is essentially just a reformulation of the inhomogeneous part in  .",
    "following the style of  @xcite we write here  @xmath133 as  @xmath134}$ ] to emphasize its role in the integro - differential operator ring .",
    "similarly , we write  @xmath135 for the definite integral over the full interval  @xmath33 , which we may regard as a linear functional  @xmath136 .    putting things together",

    "we have thus succeeded in applying the algebraic machinery to regain the solution previoulsy determined by analysis techniques .",
    "more than that : the precise form of accessible forcing functions is now fully settled , whereas the regularity assumption in   was left somewhat vague ( a sufficient condition whose necessity was left open ) .",
    "let us now address the general question of specifying and solving boundary problems ( as usual : relative to a given fundamental system ) that have only _ one singularity_. the case of multipliple singularities is left for future investigations . using a scaling transformation ( and possibly a reflection )",
    ", we may thus assume the same setting as in section  [ sec : simple - example ] , with the _ singularity at the origin _ and the other boundary point at  @xmath143 .",
    "for the scope of this paper , we shall also restrict ourselves to a certain subclass of stieltjes boundary problems  @xmath144 : first of all , we shall allow _ only local boundary conditions _ in  @xmath145 .",

    "the second restriction concerns the differential operator  @xmath146 $ ] , which we require to be _",
    "fuchsian without resonances_. the latter means the differential equation  @xmath147 is of fuchsian type ( the singularity is regular ) , and has fundamental solutions  @xmath148 with each  @xmath149 having order  @xmath86 , where  @xmath150 are the roots of the indicial equation  @xcite .",
    "in other words , we do not require logarithms for the solutions .",
    "( a sufficient  but not necessary  condition for this is that the roots  @xmath151 are all distinct and do not differ by integers . )",
    "we call  @xmath94 a _ boundary problem with mild singularity _ if  @xmath146 $ ] is a nonresonant fuchsian operator and  @xmath145 a local boundary space .    for a fixed  @xmath94 , we shall then enlarge the _ function space _  @xmath39 of section  [ sec : simple - example ] by adding  @xmath152 as algebra generators , where each  @xmath153 is the fractional part of the corresponding indicial root  @xmath151",

    "the integro - differential structure on  @xmath2 is determined by setting  @xmath157 , as usual , and by using for  @xmath158 the integral  @xmath133 as we did also in section  [ sec : simple - example ] .    as _ boundary functionals _ in  @xmath145 , we admit derivatives  @xmath159 and coefficient functionals  @xmath160 whose action is  @xmath161 . for functions",
    "@xmath142 we have of course  @xmath162 .",
    "since the projectors  @xmath61 and  @xmath60 can be expressed in terms of the coefficient functionals , we shall henceforth regard the latter just as convenient abbrevations ; boundary spaces are always written in terms of  @xmath163 and  @xmath164 only but of course they can be infinite - dimensional .",
    "for example , in section  [ sec : simple - example ] we had the `` regularized boundary condition '' @xmath74 , which is equivalent to  @xmath165 and  @xmath166 and hence to  @xmath167 .",

    "the first issue that we must now address is the choice of _ suitable boundary conditions _ : unlike in the `` smooth case '' ( without singularities ) , we may not be able to impose @xmath169  boundary conditions for an @xmath169-th order differential equation .",
    "the motivating example of section  [ sec : simple - example ] was chosen to be reasonably similar to the smooth case , so the presence of a singularity was only seen in replacing the boundary evaluation  @xmath71 by its regularized version  @xmath170 . as explained above , we were effectively adding the extra condition  @xmath166 to the standard boundary conditions  @xmath171 .",
    "in other cases , this will not do as the following simple example shows .",

    "the one on the right - hand side of  @xmath180 above ) .",
    "this is not compensated by the slightly enlarged generality of allowing  @xmath27 to have a simple pole at  @xmath32 .    in the present case",

    "we compute first some boundary functionals  @xmath183 that ensure a _ regular subproblem",
