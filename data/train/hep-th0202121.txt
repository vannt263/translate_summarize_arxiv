    "in the pioneering work of @xcite , it has been shown that there is an `` equivalence '' between 2 + 1 dimensional gravity with cosmological constant @xmath6 and chern - simons theory with a non compact group of the type @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( depending on the sign of the cosmological constant @xmath6 ) .",

    "the project of quantization of chern - simons theory for these groups has spin - offs on the program of canonical quantization of 2 + 1 quantum gravity .",
    "however one should be aware that the two theories , nor in the classical case nor in the quantum case , are not completely equivalent .",
    "these discrepencies arize from various reasons .",
    "one of them , fully understood by matschull @xcite , is that the chern - simons formulation includes degenerate metrics , and the classical phase space of chern - simons is therefore quite different from the classical phase space of 2 + 1 gravity .",
    "another one comes from the structure of boundary terms ( horizon , observer , particles ) which have to be carefully related in the two models .",
    "+ in this work , we study chern - simons formulation of 2 + 1 gravity in the case where the cosmological constant is positive i.e chern - simons theory on a 3-dimensional compact oriented manifold @xmath10 with the real non compact group @xmath11 universal covering of @xmath7 .",
    "this theory has been the subject of numerous studies , the main contributions being the work of e.witten @xcite using geometric quantization and the work of nelson - regge @xcite using representation of the algebra of observables",
    ". we will extend the analysis of nelson - regge using the so - called `` combinatorial quantization of chern - simons theory '' developped in @xcite .",
    "we first give the idea of the construction when the group is compact .",

    "the classical phase space of su(2)-chern simons theory is the symplectic manifold @xmath15 .",
    "the algebra of functions on this manifold is a poisson algebra which admits a quantization @xmath16 , called moduli algebra in @xcite , which is an associative algebra with an involution @xmath17 .",

    "this is done in two steps .",
    "they have shown that there exists a unique unitary representation @xmath34 ( @xmath17-representation ) of the loop algebra @xmath22 acting on a finite dimensional space @xmath35 .",
    "the algebra generated by the matrix elements of @xmath28 is isomorphic to @xmath36 therefore @xmath37 acts on @xmath38 @xmath34 can be restricted to the subalgebra @xmath39 and acts on the subspace of invariants @xmath40 the ideal @xmath41 is shown to be annihilated , as a result one obtains by this procedure a unitary representation of the moduli algebra .",
    "this representation can be shown to be unique up to equivalence .",
    "note that this construction is however implicit in the sense that no explicit formulae for the action of an element of @xmath16 is given in a basis of @xmath42 in this brief exposition we have oversimplified the picture : @xmath18 being a root of unity the formalism of weak quasi - hopf algebras has to be used .",
    "we will modify this construction in order to handle the @xmath11 case .",
    "the construction of the moduli algebra in this case is straightforward and is parallel to the construction in the compact case .",
