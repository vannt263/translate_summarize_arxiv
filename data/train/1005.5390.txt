    "globular clusters tend to form in all sufficiently massive galactic systems during episodes of major star formation , their relatively simple stellar populations providing important constraints on starburst and galaxy formation models ( see , e.g. , brodie & strader 2006 ) . while no globular clusters are found in low mass ( @xmath3 ) dwarf galaxies , the more massive dwarfs such as the lmc ( @xmath4 ) , smc ( @xmath5 ) and fornax ( @xmath6 )",
    "are observed to contain nineteen , eight , and five globular clusters respectively ( see , e.g. , forbes et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( @xmath7 ; law & majewski 2010 [ hereafter lm10 ] ) contains at least four clusters ( m 54 , arp 2 , terzan 7 , terzan 8 ; da costa & armandroff 1995 ) within its main body .",
    "since sgr is known to have experienced significant tidal mass loss , however , it is likely that additional globular clusters may have been stripped from sgr during its prolonged interaction with the milky way and now lie scattered throughout the galactic halo .    in the anticipation",
    "that such clusters are likely distributed across the sky , various authors ( e.g. , lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 ; irwin 1999 ; bellazzini et al . 2002",
    "; newberg et al .",
    "2003 ; majewski et al . 2004",
    "; carraro et al .",
    "2007 ) have suggested a number of additional globular clusters ( e.g. , pal 2 , pal 12 , ngc 5634 , ngc 2419 , whiting 1 , etc . ) that may have formed in the sgr dsph ( see table [ prevcands.table ] for a summary ) . perhaps the most comprehensive efforts to conduct a systematic census to date have been undertaken by palma et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , who demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between the positions and radial velocities of outer halo ( galactocentric radius @xmath8 kpc ) globular clusters and the orbit of sgr .",
    "bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2003a ) in particular presented a statistical assessment of the significance of the total number of galactic globular clusters aligned with the sgr orbital plane , concluding that there was a @xmath9% probability that the observed grouping of clusters about the sgr plane arises by chance .",
    "while this approach was certainly effective , it was based on the projected _ orbit _ of sgr ( as derived by ibata & lewis 1998 ) and therefore did not adopt an optimal membership criterion because tidal debris does not precisely follow the orbit of the parent object : trailing tidal arms lie outside the orbital path of the parent while leading tidal arms lie interior to the orbit and , in the case of sgr , wrap up around the galactic center ( see discussion by johnston et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 ; choi et al . 2007 ;",
    "eyre & binney 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , bellazini et al .",
    "( 2003a ) concentrated on the past orbit of sgr , an approach that misses potential connections to the leading arm tidal debris .    in this contribution",
    "we wish to update and extend these previous analyses , and ask whether each individual milky way satellite matches the angular position , distance , and radial velocity of sgr tidal debris sufficiently well that it is statistically likely to be physically associated with the stream and might therefore have originated in the sgr dwarf .",
    "such an undertaking is greatly aided by the significantly improved picture of the milky way  sgr system that has been provided in recent years by the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) which have mapped the stellar streams from the sgr dwarf wrapping fully @xmath10 across the sky ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ; belokurov et al .",
    "2006a ; yanny et al .",
    "these surveys have also revealed a wealth of additional substructure in the galactic halo in the form of both globular clusters and a population of dwarf galaxies with masses @xmath11 within their central 300 pc ( strigari et al .",
    "2008 ) but ultra - faint luminosities comparable to those of globular clusters .",
    "the origin of these ultra - faint dwarfs is unknown , and we consider whether any of them may be dynamically associated with the sgr dsph .",
    "our effort is also aided by the recent construction of a numerical model of the sgr stream that reproduces the majority of the observed characteristics of the stellar tidal streams with extremely high fidelity ( law et al .",
    "2009 ; lm10 ) .",
    "the comprehensive view of both leading and trailing arm material ( which overlap each other along the line of sight for large swathes of the sky ) provided by this model allows us to view potential sgr members in the context of the full debris system , and assess possible associations with leading and trailing arms based not only on spatial distributions , but on dynamical properties such as radial velocities and proper motions as well .",

    "we describe our sample of galactic satellites , incorporating globular clusters , ultra - faint dwarfs , and two open clusters for which association with sgr has previously been claimed in the literature . in  [ quantifying.sec ] we describe our numerical technique for quantifying the association of a galactic satellite with the sgr stream , applying this to individual stellar clusters and ultra - faint dwarfs in  [ comparegc.sec ] and  [ compareuf.sec ] respectively .",
    "we discuss the resulting implications for the star cluster budget of sgr and its contributions to the galactic halo in ",
    "[ discussion.sec ] , summarizing our conclusions in  [ summary.sec ] .",
    "we adopt the heliocentric sgr coordinate system ( @xmath13 ) defined by majewski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in which the longitudinal coordinate @xmath14 in the direction of sgr and increases along trailing tidal debris , and @xmath15 is positive towards the orbital pole @xmath16 ( see discussion by lm10 ) .",
    "all radial velocities are given in the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) frame , with respect to which the sun has a peculiar motion ( @xmath17 ) = ( @xmath18 ) km s@xmath19 and is located @xmath20 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we elect to compare the galactic satellite population to the lm10 @xmath12-body modelsrm4n / sgr/ ] of the sgr streams .",
    "as discussed at length in lm10 , this model was constrained to match the abundant observational data on the angular positions ( e.g. , majewski et al .",
    "2003 ; belokurov et al .",
    "2006a ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) , radial velocities ( e.g. , law et al . 2004 , 2005 ; majewski et al . 2004",
    "; monaco et al . 2007 ; yanny et al . 2009 ) , and chemical abundances ( chou et al . 2007 , 2010 ; monaco et al . 2007 ; yanny et al . 2009 ) of stars in the sgr tidal streams which have recently been provided by 2mass and sdss .",
    "this model was fully constrained using only angular positions and radial velocities for sgr stream stars ; photometric parallaxes were not used as a constraint because of their large observational uncertainties and systematic effects due to variations in metallicity and age along the tidal arms ( e.g. , chou et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) . as detailed in lm10",
    ", however , the @xmath12-body model matches distance estimates for stars in the sgr streams to within observational uncertainty .",
    "we fit to the lm10 @xmath12-body model instead of the raw observational data for four reasons : ( 1 ) the positional data for the sgr m - giant stream ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) contains an intrinsic distance scatter ( estimated to be 17% by majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) from the intrinsic width of the color - magnitude relation , as well as poorly known systematic effects in distance because of variations in the metallicity distribution function of sgr stream stars .",
    "similar systematic uncertainties also affect the sdss observations , making certain sections of the tidal arms difficult to convert to distance directly .",
    "the lm10 model incorporates these metallicity effects and is fully consistent with the m - giant color - magnitude relation and apparent magnitude trend .",
    "( 2 ) the available velocity data are still incomplete , with whole sections of the tidal arms poorly sampled",
    ". the lm10 model can fill in these gaps in our knowledge .",
    "( 3 ) there is a limit to the length of the sgr tidal tails that can be traced with individual stellar populations such as m - giants ( majewski et al . 2003 ) or blue horizontal branch stars ( yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) . additional tidal debris from older stellar generations may exist and simply be poorly traced by current observational data . with the lm10 model , the observed tails may be extrapolated to include such hypothetical older tidal debris .",
    "( 4 ) the lm10 model can provide proper motion information at all positions along the sgr tidal streams .",
    "these proper motions are well - constrained by observations in the other four dimensions of phase space , but are extremely difficulty to measure directly .    in figure [ xyfig.fig ] ( colored points )",
    "we plot a cross - sectional view of the lm10 model of the sgr system in galactocentric cartesian coordinates .",
    "the model satellite has been orbiting in the galactic potential for @xmath21 gyr , and has produced multiple epochs of tidal debris corresponding to each of its pericentric approaches to the milky way .",
    "we adopt the lm10 scheme in which tidal debris is color - coded according to the pair of orbits on which it became unbound from the sgr core : black points are currently bound to sgr , orange points became unbound in the last 1.3 gyr , magenta points between 1.3 and 3.2 gyr ago , cyan points between 3.2 and 5.0 gyr ago , and green points between 5.0 and 6.9 gyr ago ( see fig . 7 of lm10 ) .",
    "since the sgr streams frequently overlap themselves in angular position , distance , and radial velocity , it is important to distinguish the individual wraps of these streams from each other when evaluating possible associations with stellar subsystems in the galactic halo .",
    "we therefore follow lm10 in adopting a shorthand notation describing specific wraps of the streams ( see also fig",
    ". 8 of lm10 ) :    l1 : : :    primary wrap of the leading arm of sgr ( i.e. ,    @xmath22 angular separation from the    dwarf ) . traced by orange / magenta points near the sgr dwarf ,    magenta / cyan / green points at larger angular separations .",
    "l1y : : :    young subset of the l1 wrap , incorporating only orange / magenta points    ( i.e. , debris lost during the last 3 gyr ) .",
    "l2 : : :    secondary wrap of the leading arm of sgr ( i.e. ,    @xmath23 angular separation from the    dwarf ) . traced almost entirely by cyan / green points .",
    "t1 : : :    primary wrap of the trailing arm of sgr ( i.e. ,    @xmath22 angular separation from the    dwarf ) . traced by orange / magenta points near the sgr dwarf ,    magenta / cyan / green points at larger angular separations .",
    "t1y : : :    young subset of the t1 wrap , incorporating only orange / magenta points    ( i.e. , debris lost during the last 3 gyr ) . t2 : : :    secondary wrap of the trailing arm of sgr ( i.e. ,    @xmath23 angular separation from the    dwarf ) . traced almost entirely by cyan / green points .",
    "the l1y and t1y stream segments described above correspond most closely to those phases of tidal debris @xmath24 gyr in age for which there is the strongest observational evidence from the 2mass and sdss wide - field surveys .",
    "the true length of the debris streams is unknown however , and it is possible that they may extend substantially further than has been conclusively observed to date .",
    "the l2/t2 streams ( and the cyan / green sections of l1/t1 ) represent model predictions for where such putative older tidal debris may lie , should it be present in the galactic halo .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ xyfig.fig ] , the most recent ( i.e. , @xmath24 gyr in age ) sgr tidal debris lies at distances @xmath25 kpc from the sun , and greater than 8 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the lm10 simulations suggest , however , that putative l2/t2 tidal debris may exist as much as 100 kpc away .",
    "we therefore construct our comparison sample of galactic globular clusters by extracting all those with galactocentric radii @xmath26 kpc from the harris ( 1996 , with feb .",
    "2003 update ) catalog ; this conservatively includes all well - known globular clusters that might conceivably be associated with sgr .",
    "we note that this rules out checking for possible angular alignments with much more distant clusters that may have been lost extremely at extremely early times ; we discuss this point further in  [ nearfargcs.sec ] .",
    "motivated by claims for association with sgr tidal debris by carraro et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) , we also include in our sample the star clusters whiting 1 , berkeley 29 ( be 29 ) , and saurer 1 ( sa 1 ) .",
    "while be 29 and sa 1 are commonly regarded as galactic open clusters , their physical properties overlap with the lower - mass globular clusters in our sample , and we consider that they may be sparse halo globular clusters which happen to lie near the galactic disk .",
    "recent years have witnessed the discovery in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) of a multitude of `` ultra - faint '' galactic satellites that have significantly lower luminosity than the classic dwarf spheroidal galaxy population , but half - light radii too large to be traditional globular clusters ( see , e.g. , discussion by gilmore et al .",
    "the origin of this low luminosity population is uncertain , and some have been suggested to be stellar overdensities previously associated at some time in the past with massive dsphs such as sgr .",
    "we therefore include in our analysis the ultra - faint systems botes i ( boo i ) , botes ii ( boo ii ) , coma berenices ( coma ber ) , pisces i , segue 1 , segue 2 , segue 3 , ursa major ii ( uma ii ) , and willman i. the canes venatici i , canes venatici ii , hercules , leo iv , leo v , leo t , and ursa major i systems along with the classical dsph population ( e.g. , carina , draco , fornax , etc . ) are excluded from formal consideration since they lie at large distances ( typically greater than 100 kpc ) at which there is no sgr tidal debris in the lm10 model , although we discuss some of them briefly in  [ distantufs.sec ] .",

    "we conclude that there are likely @xmath178 globular clusters genuinely associated with the sgr stream .",
    "the @xmath161 statistic defined in  [ gcstats.sec ] above is not appropriate for the ultra - faint satellite population discovered in the sdss .",
    "not only do these satellites have a different radial number density profile than the globular clusters , but they are subject to a strong selection bias in the sense that only satellites lying within the sdss footprint could have been discovered . since the sgr stream occupies a significant fraction of this footprint , the ultra - faint satellites discovered to date will therefore be predisposed to lie relatively close to the stream .",
    "we therefore develop an alternative formulation of the @xmath161 statistic appropriate to the ultra - faint satellites .",
    "since the radial number density profile of this population is poorly constrained by the small number of such satellites discovered to date , we generate an artificial comparison population whose galactocentric radii match those of the observed satellites .",
    "we assume that this artificial population is spherically symmetric about the milky way , but reject from consideration any satellites that fall outside of the sdss footprint .",
    "sufficiently many artificial satellites are generated that the final population that falls within the sdss footprint is composed of @xmath153 members , for each of which a radial velocity is chosen from a gaussian random distribution with mean @xmath179 @xmath148and standard deviation @xmath180 @xmath148that fits the observed distribution of @xmath181 for the real satellites in question .    in figure [ randomuf.fig ]",
    "we plot @xmath161 as a function of @xmath160 for this artificially generated comparison population , noting that its cumulative distribution rises much more steeply than did the cumulative distribution of the artificial globular clusters ( figure [ random.fig ] ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that since the ultra - faint satellites by definition lie within the sdss footprint , they are predisposed to relatively strong apparent correlations with the sgr stream . figure [ nofpuf.fig ] plots the histogram of @xmath162 and @xmath163 for the eight ultra - faint satellites whose radial velocities have been measured .",
    "the roughly uniform distribution between @xmath173 indicates that the satellites are statistically consistent with being unassociated with the sgr stream . in particular",
    ", there is no clump at low values of @xmath161 corresponding to close association with the sgr streams .",
    "indeed , there may be weak evidence ( at the @xmath182 level ) using the @xmath162 statistic for an _ anti - correlation _ between some of these satellites and the sgr streams as indicated by the high @xmath172 for @xmath183 ( blue histogram in figure [ nofpuf.fig ] ) .",
    "caution is therefore advisable in the evaluation of individual ultra - faint systems given their propensity to appear physically close to the sgr streams simply by virtue of the location of the sdss survey fields .",
    "our numerical method of quantifying the degree of association of individual milky way satellites with the sgr stellar debris streams is based upon some significant assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the lm10 model is an accurate representation of the real sgr stream .",
    "while this is a good assumption for the l1y and t1y wraps of the leading and trailing tidal arms ( where the model was constrained to match observational data ) , it is unknown how well the model may describe tidal debris more widely separated from the dwarf",
    ". it may be the case that the most extended regions of the tidal tails ( if they exist in the galactic halo ) depart significantly from the lm10 model . indeed , since the lm10 model does not explicitly include orbital evolution of the sgr dwarf ( e.g. , via dynamical friction ) , some mismatch in the oldest sections of the tidal streams is likely .",
    "we therefore generally place our greatest confidence in the @xmath162 statistic , which quantifies the association of individual systems with only those segments of the sgr stream that have been conclusively detected in the galactic halo and used to constrain the lm10 model .",
    "second , we assume that globular clusters stripped from sgr follow the path of sgr tidal debris .",
    "we believe this to be a reasonable assumption because neither unbound tidal debris nor globular clusters are sufficiently massive to have their orbits noticeably altered by dynamical friction in the gravitational potential of the milky way .",
    "third , and particularly relevant to the case of the ultra - faint satellites , we have assumed that the artificial comparison satellite distribution is spherically symmetric about the milky way .",

    "the four globular clusters m 54 , arp 2 , terzan 7 , and terzan 8 have traditionally been associated with the sgr dsph ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "1994 ; da costa & armandroff 1995 ) ; these four ` core ' clusters lie within @xmath187 kpc of the best - fitting sgr debris plane and @xmath188 ( @xmath189 kpc ) of the sgr dwarf core along the trailing tidal stream .",
    "to within observational uncertainty , m 54 appears to be spatially coincident with the core of sgr , and to lie at the same distance and radial velocity .",
    "while m 54 is certainly associated with the sgr dwarf ( we calculate a less than @xmath190% chance that an artificial globular cluster would chance to match sgr so well ) , its velocity dispersion and luminosity profile indicate that it formed independently of the sgr core and later sank to its present position via dynamical friction ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2008 , see also majewski et al .",
    "2003 ; monaco et al . 2005",
    "; siegel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "arp 2 and terzan 8 each have similarly strong probabilities for association . while proper motion information is not available for these clusters to confirm the association , the strength of the match in angular position , distance , and radial velocity is sufficient to give us confidence in concurring with previous studies ( see table [ prevcands.table ] ) that m 54 , arp 2 , and terzan 8 are genuine sgr members .",
    "indeed , out of a sample of 51 randomly chosen artificial globular clusters we should expect less than @xmath191 of them to match the sgr stream so well by chance , let alone the 3 that are actually observed .",
    "in contrast , terzan 7 has a significantly lower confidence for association ( @xmath192 ) ; we expect @xmath193 satellites in a given sample of 51 to meet this threshold simply by chance .",
    "however , the high @xmath162 primarily reflects our adopted distance to terzan 7 ( @xmath194 kpc ) , which is almost 5 kpc less than the distance to the sgr core ( @xmath195 kpc ; siegel et al .",
    "2007 ) adopted in the lm10 model . if the lm10 model had instead adopted a slightly smaller distance for sgr ( reasonable estimates range from @xmath196 kpc ; see table 2 of kunder & chaboyer 2009 for a summary ) , the quality of fit of terzan 7 to the sgr stream would improve considerably .",
    "similarly , had we adopted a distance of @xmath197 kpc for terzan 7 ( m. siegel 2009 , private communication ) based on new photometry akin to that used to set the sgr distance scale in siegel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we would have found @xmath198 and @xmath199 . while terzan 7 is therefore not as robust a sgr cluster candidate as m 54 , arp 2 , or terzan 8 , physical association is still likely .",
    "future proper motion measurements should be able to verify this ; the proper motion of the terzan 7 region of the sgr stream is extremely well constrained by current observational data , and if terzan 7 is moving with the stream the lm10 model suggests that we should expect it to have a proper motion @xmath200 cos@xmath201 mas yr@xmath19 and @xmath202 mas yr@xmath19 .",
    "previous studies of the star cluster budget of the sgr dwarf ( e.g. , palma et al . 2002 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "2003a ) have typically neglected sparse open clusters located in the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "however , carrarro & bensby ( 2009 ) argue that the metal - poor ( @xmath204}}= -0.44 \\pm 0.18 $ ] and @xmath205 respectively ; carraro et al .",
    "2004 ) cluster pair be 29 and sa 1 may be members of the sgr stream .",
    "although typically regarded as open clusters , be 29 and sa 1 have ages , metallicities , and richness intermediate between classical globular cluster and open cluster designations . since be 29 in particular ( 1 ) lies @xmath206 kpc above the galactic plane , ( 2 ) is the most distant known open cluster ( tosi et al .",
    "2004 ) , and ( 3 ) is brighter and richer than some globular clusters ( e.g. , am 4 , whiting 1 , and fornax - h1 ) , we consider it reasonable that these two clusters may indeed be part of the halo population rather than the disk .",
    "while both clusters are approximately coincident with the sgr l1 arm , be 29 is the superior match with @xmath207 ( compared to @xmath208 for sa 1 ) .",
    "visually , figure [ leaddat.fig ] confirms this : be 29 is superimposed on the l1 arm while sa 1 lies off the projected path of the sgr stream by @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) in sgr orbital latitude @xmath15 .",
    "both clusters lie at a distance @xmath211 kpc consistent with that of the l1 arm , but be 29 is a slightly better match to the l1 stream in radial velocity ( although still discrepant by @xmath212 @xmath148 , or @xmath213 ) than is sa 1 ( off by @xmath214 @xmath148 , or @xmath215 ) .",
    "the radial velocity of the l1 stream is not well constrained in this region however since it lies @xmath216 and @xmath209 respectively beyond the last 2mass ( see , e.g. , figure [ mgdat.fig ] ) and sdss observations used to constrain the lm10 model , and it is therefore possible that the lm10 model at the location of be 29 and sa 1 may be in error by up to a few tens of kilometers per second .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is that neither sa 1 nor be 29 are associated with the sgr stream , and that both are unusual galactic disk open clusters that happen to lie near the nexus at which the l1 arm crosses through the disk and happen to have radial velocities resembling that of the stream .",
    "given the thousands of open clusters in the galactic disk , it is perhaps unsurprising that some cluster might happen to have the requisite combination of properties .",
    "this simple hypothesis is probably true for sa 1 considering its low statistical probability for association with the sgr stream ( @xmath208 ) but the low @xmath207 for be 29 may favor the sgr - origin hypothesis .",
    "although a tentative measurement of the proper motion of be 29 was presented by dias et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , frinchaboy ( 2006 ) demonstrated that the majority of stars used to make this measurement were foreground field stars .",
    "only a single star had the correct magnitude and radial velocity to be a cluster member , and the proper motion of this star ( @xmath200 cos@xmath217 mas yr@xmath19 , @xmath218 mas yr@xmath19 ; p. frinchaboy 2010 [ priv .",
    "communication ] ) is too uncertain to offer a significant constraint on the relation between be 29 and the sgr stream .",
    "if be 29 is indeed a member of the sgr stream , it is intriguing that this cluster is wrapped farther from the sgr dwarf than all tidal debris conclusively observed to date , and is the only known cluster ( except possibly for pal 12 ) associated with the leading tidal arm .",
    "the l1 arm at the location of be 29 has been unbound from the sgr core for at least 2.5 gyr , meaning that if be 29 formed in the sgr dwarf @xmath219 gyr ago ( carraro et al .",
    "2004 derive an age of 4.5 gyr , while tosi et al .",
    "2004 find @xmath220 gyr ) it must have been torn from sgr shortly after its formation , and has since experienced at least 3 orbits around the milky way .",
    "given the similarities between be 29 , whiting 1 , and terzan 7 in age , metallicity , luminosity , horizontal - branch type , and size ( see discussion in  [ discussion.sec ] ) we suggest that be 29 may be a paradigm for the origins of some old , metal - poor ` open clusters ' in the milky way ; namely , that they may be a class of sparse globular cluster formed in dsph , stripped from their sheltering birth galaxies , and subjected to the gravitational tides of the milky way .",
    "ic 1257 has never previously been suggested as a possible sgr cluster , but our analysis indicates that it resembles the l2 wrap at @xmath222 to @xmath223 .",
    "this association is not particularly compelling however ; while it closely matches the distance of the l2 wrap ( @xmath224 kpc ) the angular position is inconsistent by @xmath225 and the radial velocity by @xmath226 @xmath148 .",

    "if segue 1 is associated with the sgr stream , table [ results1.table ] suggests that the most likely such association is with the t1 trailing wrap of debris wrapped into the northern galactic hemisphere ( the radial velocity is mismatched with the t2/l1 arms by 190/249 @xmath148respectively , and the distance is a factor of @xmath206 too great to match the l2 arm ) .",

    "it is perhaps unsurprising that we are unable to associate any stellar clusters with the older t2/l2 wraps of sgr tidal debris confidently , given the possible destruction of these clusters over time , the current lack of evidence for these sections of sgr stream in the galactic halo and the correspondingly poor constraints on the lm10 model in this regime .",

    "alternatively , discrete stellar systems such as globular clusters may simply have formed sufficiently deep in the sgr gravitational potential well that they have only been stripped from the dwarf after it has already experienced significant tidal disruption .",

    "[ amr.fig ] ( left panel ) , we plot the ages and metallicities ( drawn from tabulations by marin - franch et al . 2009 , and forbes & bridges 2010 ) of our eleven high / moderate / low confidence sgr globular clusters . as discussed recently by forbes & bridges ( 2010 ) for a sample of sgr - candidate clusters drawn from the literature ,",
    "the clusters describe a relatively well defined age - metallicity relation ( amr ) , which we note is generally consistent with the closed - box sgr amr derived by siegel et al .",
    "we identify three groupings of clusters in particular in figure [ amr.fig ] : m 54 , ngc 5053 , ngc 5634 , pal 2 , and ter 8 resemble the oldest sgr stellar population ( ` m54 mpp ' ) , arp 2 and ngc 4147 resemble the second - oldest sgr stellar population ( ` sgr mpp ' ) , and be 29 , pal 12 , ter 7 , and whiting 1 resemble the intermediate age sgr stellar population ( ` sint ' ) .    in figure [ amr.fig ]",
    "( right panel ) we show the lee diagram of the candidate sgr globular clusters , plotting metallicity versus horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology @xmath463 , where @xmath464 , @xmath465 , and @xmath466 represent the number of blue , variable , and red horizontal branch stars respectively .",
    "as has often been noted previously ( e.g. , mottini & wallerstein 2008 , and references therein ) , the sgr candidate globular clusters are a bimodal group of red- and blue - hb clusters .",
    "intriguingly , the strongest sgr cluster candidates ( i.e. , cyan filled squares ) are those which , despite their @xmath193 gyr spread in ages , show the least evidence for a second - parameter affecting their hb morphologies and lie closest to the single - parameter ( i.e. , metallicity ) locus defined by zinn ( 1993a ; solid line in the right panel of figure [ amr.fig ] ) .",
    "the moderate - confidence clusters be 29 , pal 12 , and ter 7 also follow the single - parameter locus , while ngc 5053 and the two low - confidence clusters ngc 4147 and pal 2 have hbs redder than expected for their metallicity .",
    "the absence of a second - parameter effect in the sgr globular clusters is in marked contrast to the globular cluster systems of the lmc and fornax ( e.g. , zinn 1993b ; buonanno et al .",
    "1999 ; mackey & gilmore 2004 ) , which show moderate / strong influences of a second parameter on their respective hb types at a given metallicity .",
    "this may suggest that the strength of the second - parameter effect on the hb morphologies of accreted globular clusters could somehow be determined by the subhalo in which they were formed , offering a criterion by which to associate clusters in the halo of the milky way with their parent satellites .    although there is a strong gradient in the chemistry of stars along the sgr streams ( see , e.g. , chou et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) , there is no comparable gradient for the sgr globular clusters . while the two globular clusters wrapped farthest from the sgr dwarf ( ngc 5053 and ngc 5634 , wrapped @xmath467 and @xmath468 from sgr respectively )",
    "are the most metal - poor of the clusters , their closest chemical kin ( arp 2 , m 54 , ter 8) lie @xmath469 from sgr .",
    "similarly , the relatively metal - rich clusters whiting 1 and berkeley 29 lie in the dynamically young ( @xmath470 separation from sgr ) and old ( @xmath471 separation from sgr ) sections of the stream respectively . indeed , if berkeley 29 formed 4.5 gyr ago ( carraro et al .",
    "2004 ; 3.4 - 3.7 gyr ago from the estimate of tosi et al .",
    "2004 ) in the ` sint ' burst of star formation , the lm10 model suggests that it must have been stripped from sgr less than a gyr after its formation since it would have taken @xmath275 gyr since stripping to reach its present longitudinal separation from sgr .",
    "our major conclusions may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we find that five globular clusters ( arp 2 , m 54 , ngc 5634 , terzan 8 , and whiting 1 ) are very likely to be associated with the sgr dwarf , an additional 4 ( berkeley 29 , ngc 5053 , pal 12 , terzan 7 ) are moderately likely to be associated , and two ( ngc 4147 , pal 2 ) may be associated with relatively low confidence .",
    "confining our attention to those in the high- and moderate - confidence categories , we conclude that 5 - 9 globular clusters are genuinely associated with sgr , consistent with our expectation of @xmath2 clusters based on statistical realizations of a randomly distributed artificial globular cluster population .",
    "2 .   based on updated estimates of the initial luminosity of the pre - interaction sgr dwarf ( @xmath472 )",
    ", we estimate a specific globular cluster frequency @xmath0 typical of de galaxies .",
    "the globular clusters identified as most likely to be associated with sgr are consistent with the amr of sgr s stellar populations , and show no evidence for a second - parameter effect shaping their horizontal branch morphologies .",
    "if the presence of a second - parameter effect is a reliable indicator of sgr membership , it suggests that the two lowest - confidence sgr clusters ( ngc 4147 and pal 2 ) and the moderate - confidence cluster ngc 5053 may not be genuinely associated with sgr .",
    "there is no obvious correlation of age , metallicity , or horizontal branch morphology with distance from sgr along the tidal streams .",
    "we find no compelling evidence to associate sgr with any of the population of ultra - faint milky way satellites recently discovered in the sdss .",
    "the ultra - faint satellite population is statistically consistent with being unassociated with the sgr tidal streams , but we are unable to rule out association conclusively in all cases .",
    "we caution , however , that our results are based upon comparisons to sections of the sgr stream that we presently observe in the galactic halo , and do not account for possible variations in the orbit of sgr over time .",
    "for instance , we do not address here the ( likely ) possibility that dynamical friction has altered the orbit of sgr over its lifetime , nor are we able to constrain the possibility that some objects may have been loosely affiliated with sgr and fallen into the milky way as a group .",
    "future observational constraints on the length and characteristics of the sgr tidal streams will help to further understand the accretion origins of substructure within our galactic halo .",
