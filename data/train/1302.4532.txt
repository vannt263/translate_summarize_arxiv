    "the convergence of @xmath17 at the optimal scale @xmath18 , up to logarithmic corrections , the so - called _ local semicircle law _ , was established for wigner matrices in a series of papers  @xcite , where it was also shown that the eigenvectors of wigner matrices are completely delocalized .",
    "the proof is based on a self - consistent equation for @xmath17 and the continuity of the green function  @xmath19 in the spectral parameter @xmath20 . in  @xcite convergence of green function entries was established on optimal scales .",

    "physically , the diagonal matrix may represent an on - site random potential on a lattice system .",
    "compared to the mean - field nature of wigner matrices , which are in the weak disorder or the delocalization regime , the diagonal randomness also provides a good example of the strong disorder or localization regime .    in this paper",
    "we consider the interpolation of the two , i.e. , the @xmath21 random matrix @xmath22 where @xmath2 is a real diagonal random matrix , or a ` random potential ' , and @xmath1 is a real symmetric or complex hermitian wigner matrix independent of @xmath2 .",
