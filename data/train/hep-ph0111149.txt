    "conventional wisdom tells us that gravity is the weakest , by far , of the four fundamental forces of the universe .",
    "however , the possibility of large extra dimensions @xcite where gravity becomes strong at scales of order a tev , may lead to a complete revision of conventional wisdom .",
    "this possibility has spawned a great deal of research , both phenomenological and experimental , into the discovery or exclusion of extra dimensional gravity scenarios .",
    "the first such scenario @xcite , commonly known as add extra dimensional gravity , suggests that extra spatial dimensions ( the bulk ) beyond the usual 3 ( the wall ) exist in which gravity operates . for distances larger than the extra dimension length scale ,",
    "the effective planck mass is large , @xmath3 , while for distances smaller than the extra dimension length scale , the true planck mass is small , @xmath4 .",
    "the attractiveness of add and other extra dimensional gravity scenarios is that they solve the hierarchy and naturalness problems by moving the scale of gravity to something near the electroweak scale .",
    "the phenomenology of the add model has been studied extensively ; the feynman rules are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . among the many processes studied to date , atwood , bar - shalom and soni @xcite recently studied the effect of graviton tower exchange to dijet production at hadron colliders . unlike a direct graviton production process ,",
    "where the graviton produced appears as a missing @xmath5 signature , dijet production is sensitive to virtual graviton exchange in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 channels ( depending on the subprocess ) .",
    "virtual graviton exchange can modify various experimental observables to be significantly different than standard model ( sm ) predictions , and add scenarios can be discovered or excluded based on measured deviations from sm predictions .",
    "similar analyses are possible under other extra dimensional gravity scenarios , such as randall - sundrum @xcite , but those analyses are beyond the scope of this study .",
    "@xcite , equations for all the necessary parton level subprocesses are given .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite reported exclusion limits at the tevatron and lhc based on deviations from the sm @xmath2 distribution , where @xmath2 is the usual product of parton momentum fractions @xmath9 but can also be expressed in terms of experimental observables @xmath10 ( the jet - jet invariant mass ) and @xmath6 ( the square of the center of mass energy ) .",
    "based on recent compositeness searches by the cdf and d0 @xcite collaborations , we felt that alternate experimental observables could improve the search reach here .",
    "one favorite observable is transverse momentum ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 are natural choices .",
    "psuedorapidity , @xmath11 is another commonly used observable .",
    "related to @xmath12 is @xmath13 in addition , a ratio of @xmath10 distribution with @xmath14 to @xmath10 distribution with @xmath15 was found to be useful in compositeness searches .    in order to simulate detector acceptance , we count jets only when @xmath16 and @xmath17 . furthermore , we assume an integrated luminosity of @xmath18 for the tevatron and @xmath19 for the lhc . with these acceptance cuts and integrated luminosities ,",
    "the event rates are large , leading to a high level of sensitivity to deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "as will be clear below , this analysis will not depend strongly on the value of the @xmath0 cut ; the strongest deviation from sm occurs at @xmath0 significantly higher than @xmath20 . for our analysis , cteq5 m",
    "@xcite distributions are used .    for all observables ,",
    "a @xmath21 analysis was performed , where @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the event number in a specific bin , and only statistical errors were considered , so that the uncertainty in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , equals @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 corresponds to a 95% c.l .",
    "deviation from the sm .",
    "we chose the number of bins to be 50 for the tevatron and 100 for the lhc ; this corresponds to @xmath0 bin sizes of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath0 distribution , @xmath29 , is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , for both the tevatron and the lhc ; the sm ( solid line ) is compared with extra dimensional gravity predictions for the number of extra dimensions @xmath30 of 3 and 4 , as indicated on the figures .",
    "the extra dimensional gravity points include statistical uncertainty only , and the horizontal dashed line indicates 1 event / bin .",
    "the other extra dimensional gravity parameter , the planck mass @xmath31 , is chosen to be @xmath32 for the tevatron and @xmath33 for the lhc .",
    "there is a large excess of events at high @xmath0 , and it is clear that the exclusion limits possible far exceed the values of @xmath31 chosen to produce figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the search / exclusion limits possible at the tevatron are @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) for @xmath36 ( 4 ) , while the limits at the lhc are @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "similar limits are possible using @xmath1 and @xmath2 distribution ; the limits for these observables are only a few 10s of @xmath39 lower .",
    "the other observables mentioned above ( @xmath40 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) provide limits that are significantly lower than those from the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite chose one of the best possible observables on which to base their analysis .",
    "the exclusion limits reported here are slightly higher than those in ref .",
    "@xcite , even for the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "this is almost certainly due to our use of a finer binning of observables in the distributions . just as",
    "a distribution will give a higher @xmath21 than a total cross section , a more finely binned distribution will give a higher @xmath21 than a coarser binning , assuming sufficient event numbers .",
    "the binning used here for the @xmath0 distribution is rather coarse , so our results are , in a sense , conservative .",
    "due to the extremely high event rate , dijet production at hadron colliders is a favorite for searches for physics beyond the standard model . as shown originally by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , dijet production at the tevatron and the lhc is very sensitive to virtual graviton exchange effects , as provided by extra dimensional gravity scenarios .    in this re - analysis",
    ", we studied a number of observables related to dijet production , and found that the @xmath0 distribution was more sensitive to virtual graviton effects than the @xmath2 distribution proposed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , but only slightly more sensitive .",
    "a more thorough analysis , including a more realistic detector simulation and systematic effects , is required , but the more careful analysis will not change the fact that dijet production at hadron colliders will be an important probe of extra dimensional gravity models .",
