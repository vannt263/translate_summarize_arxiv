    "casimir forces are one of the most remarkable macroscopic manifestations of the vacuum fluctuations of the em field  @xcite .",
    "the precision achieved in recent experiments to measure those forces has encouraged further work to obtain more detailed theoretical predictions for them ; in particular , it has become increasingly clear that the geometry and electromagnetic properties of the materials are the two most important aspects that must be taken into account for those predictions to be accurate .    in spite of the intense activity in this field of research , comparison between theory and experiment",
    "is not yet entirely satisfying , what leaves some room for debate  @xcite . among",
    "the most widely used tools to tackle these issues , lifshitz formula  @xcite occupies a prominent place .",
    "indeed , on the one hand it can be used as the starting point for computing the casimir force away from the idealized , perfect conductivity case . on the other",
    ", it can also be applied to incorporate non - trivial geometrical effects , at least when the surfaces involved are close to each other and smooth .",
    "indeed , lifshitz formula , originally meant just for flat and parallel slabs may also be thought of as the leading term , the so called proximity force approximation  @xcite ( pfa ) , in a derivative expansion ( de ) of the free energy , regarded as a functional of the shape of the function(s ) defining the surfaces involved  @xcite . in the language of quantum field theory ,",
    "the de may be consistently viewed as a low - momentum expansion of the vertex functions , with the pfa playing the role of leading term , involving the summation of an infinite number of vertex functions at zero - momentum .",
    "the next to leading order term , in turn , requires the knowledge of vertex functions at the second order in momentum .",
    "a similar approach has also been applied in  @xcite to find an interesting approximation for the casimir - polder interaction force , assuming that the surfaces are gently curved .    regarding the em properties of the media involved , it is usually sufficient to use a version of lifshitz formula which describes them by means of an isotropic , frequency dependent permittivity @xmath4 and , when magnetic properties are relevant , also its permeability @xmath5 .",
    "note , however , that even though lifshitz formula has been derived using a variety of approaches  @xcite , its applicability to dissipative systems is still debated @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , in some particular situations , non - analyticities in the expansion of the vertex functions could produce non - local ntlo corrections to the pfa within the context of the de .",
    "this has been explicitly shown for quantum scalar fields at non zero temperature in the presence of perfect mirrors described by neumann boundary conditions )  @xcite .",
    "this also holds true for a real scalar field with neumann conditions in @xmath6 dimensions , albeit it can be shown that the non - analyticity can be cured ( in a concrete model ) by introducing a small departure from perfect neumann conditions  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we analyse the emergence of non - analyticities in the de for real materials which , based on the insight from our previous work  @xcite , should come from contributions due to the dimensionally reduced massless modes , which appear as the zero frequency terms in a matsubara expansion of the fields . to carry out such an analysis",
    ", it is convenient to have a general formula for the de , corresponding to the free energy for the em field in the presence of media with realistic properties .",
    "this kind of formula has been used ( although not explicitly displayed ) by other authors in a previous work  @xcite . there",
    ", the casimir free energy has been evaluated using the scattering matrix approach , based on earlier results about the @xmath7-matrix elements for the scattering of electromagnetic waves , computed in a perturbative expansion in the departure from the planar surface case  @xcite .",
    "it is our aim in this work to carry out an analysis of the validity of the de using a different approach , for a closely related physical system : we incorporate the possibility for the media to have non - trivial magnetic properties . on the other hand",
    ", our approach to the construction of the de proceeds along different lines : we use a functional integral approach and the matsubara formalism to single out the zero mode contributions from the very beginning .",
    "we then apply the de approach , performing an independent perturbative calculation in that dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "we find conditions for the de to be well - defined , and single out models where those conditions are not met .    in the first principles functional approach that we follow ,",
    "the derivation dwells on a subtle point related to the choice of the temporal gauge for the em field at a non - zero temperature  @xcite , which allows for a clean isolation of the problematic zero mode , the origin of the `` plasma - drude '' controversy in the calculation of the casimir force at a non vanishing temperature  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is precisely this zero mode the same which , depending on the case considered , may or not exhibit a non - analytic behavior as a function of the external momenta of the generalized vertices .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : thesys ] we present the system that we want to study and the main assumptions made in order to calculate its casimir free energy , having in mind its treatment within the context of the de approach .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present explicit results on the zero - mode contributions to the free energy , for media described by non trivial permittivities or permeabilities . in sect .",
    "[ sec : analyt ] we study the eventual emergence of non - analyticities in the ntlo correction of the pfa . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "some technical but nevertheless relevant details of the calculations are presented in appendix a.",
    "the geometry of the systems that we consider can be determined by specifying just two surfaces , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "our construction will begin with cases where they are the boundaries between two spatial regions , filled by material media .",
    "the surfaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , defined by and , where @xmath10 is a smooth function of two cartesian coordinates on an @xmath11 plane , for which we will adopt the shorthand notation .",
    "a real medium will be described by introducing isotropic , spatially local permittivities and permeabilities ( in other words , they are defined by scalar functions , since the corresponding tensors are proportional to the identity matrix ) .",
    "the perfect - conductor case will be obtained as a particular limit .",
    "since we deal with a quantum field at a finite temperature , it is convenient to introduce its free energy @xmath12 , a function of the inverse temperature @xmath13 ( in our conventions , boltzmann s constant @xmath14 ) and a real functional , i.e. , a real - valued function , of @xmath15 . for the sake of notational clarity ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 is not explicitly shown .",
    "@xmath17 may be written in terms of the partition function , @xmath18 , as follows : @xmath19\\;,\\ ] ] where the denominator , @xmath20 , denotes the partition function for the free em field , i.e. , in the absence of media .",
    "the effect of that denominator is to subtract the free energy of a free bose gas of photons in the absence of the mirrors , which does not contribute to the force between them .",
    "there are other contributions to the free energy which are independent of the distance between the two media , namely , that are invariant under @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "they can , usually in a rather straightforward way , be identified with self - energies of the mirrors .",
    "that is , contributions which measure the energy of the distorted vacuum corresponding to the em field in the presence of just one medium ( taking the zero - point energy of the em field as reference ) . since we are ultimately interested in the calculation of the part of the free energy which is responsible for the ( normal ) force between the two media , those terms will be discarded .    in the matsubara ( imaginary - time )",
    "formalism , a functional integral expression for the partition function @xmath18 can be constructed by integrating over field configurations depending on the spatial coordinates @xmath23 and the imaginary time @xmath24 .",
    "the fields are periodic , with period @xmath16 , in the imaginary time . denoting by @xmath25 , ( @xmath26 ) the @xmath27-potential in euclidean spacetime , the form of @xmath18 is as follows : @xmath28 \\ ; e^{-{\\mathcal s}_{\\rm inv}(a)}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the gauge - invariant action for @xmath30 , with gauge transformations given by , .",
    "@xmath31 is the unconstrained functional - integration measure , while @xmath32 $ ] is used to denote that measure after gauge fixing .    in terms of the components of the field strength tensor @xmath33 , the form of the gauge - invariant action",
    "is : @xmath34 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where indices from the middle of the roman alphabet run over spatial indices ( einstein summation convention has been adopted ) , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the euclidean versions of the permittivity and permeability , respectively ( @xmath37 is the inverse integral kernel of @xmath1 , with respect to its time - like arguments ) . space locality of those response functions has been assumed implicitly .    on account of our assumptions on the geometry of the system , we have that : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 characterize the permittivity and permeability of the respective mirror .",
    "note that the free ( vacuum ) form of the action is @xmath41 where @xmath42 , the integral over @xmath43 goes from @xmath44 to @xmath16 ( the fields being periodic , any interval of length @xmath16 can be used as the extent of the imaginary time coordinate to define the action ) .",
    "the action is invariant under translations in the imaginary time : @xmath45 .",
    "this suggests the use of mixed fourier transformations for the fields , as well as for the response functions : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "the gauge transformations can be represented in fourier space ; to that end , note that , since the field @xmath49 is periodic , so must be @xmath50 .",
    "then we can expand this object in terms of a fourier series , @xmath51 note , however , that @xmath52 needs not to be periodic .",
    "it may be seen that its more general form is as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants , and @xmath56 is periodic : @xmath57 hence , the full set of gauge transformations for the gauge field may be written , using a fourier transform for the time arguments , as follows : @xmath58 from the explicit form above for the gauge transformations in the same ` mixed ' fourier representation , we see that one possible gauge fixing condition , which we will adopt throughout this article , is the _ temporal _ gauge , which in this finite - temperature setup is given by : @xmath59    we then write the thermal partition function using the mixed fourier representation . using the properties : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ,",
    "it is rather straightforward to see that it may be written as an infinite product of ( decoupled ) integrals , involving the zero mode , and just the positive ( or , alternatively , negative ) modes : @xmath63 where @xmath64\\;e^{- { \\mathcal s}^{(0)}(\\widetilde{a}_0^{(0 ) } , \\widetilde{a}_j^{(0)})}\\ ] ] and , for @xmath65 , @xmath66\\;e^{- { \\mathcal s}^{(n)}(\\widetilde{a}_j^{(n ) } , \\widetilde{a}_j^{(n ) * } ) } \\ ] ] where @xmath67 involves two real fields : one of them is the zero - frequency component of @xmath68 , which behaves as a scalar in the euclidean @xmath6 dimensional space . the other",
    ", corresponding to the zero - mode for @xmath69 , is a real vector field : @xmath70\\ ] ] where we have introduced : @xmath71\\;.\\ ] ] note that @xmath72 vanishes for a dielectric and also for a metal described by the drude model . on the other hand",
    ", it equals the plasma frequency for a metal described by the plasma model .    since , by assumption , there is vacuum between the two mirrors , @xmath73 , and in that region .",
    "thus the scalar and vector fields behave there as a free massless scalar and a free gauge field , respectively . in each one of the regions occupied by a mirror",
    ", the scalar field lagrangian is multiplied by a constant ( in a wave - function renormalization fashion ) , while the vector field also has a constant proca - like mass ( each constant is determined by the properties of the medium on the mirror considered ) . besides the latter also has a factor similar to the scalar field one , but determined by the permeability .    as a consequence of the temporal gauge choice , there is no scalar field mode in the @xmath74 terms .",
    "they always involve just a complex vector field : @xmath75 with a proca - like mass which , contrary to what happened for the zero mode , is non - vanishing between the mirrors .",
    "note that , except for the @xmath76 mode , each term corresponds to combining two different matsubara modes , namely , @xmath77 and @xmath78 into the action for a complex field .",
    "this is possible because of the reality of the permittivity in fourier space , which is in turn a reflection of the parity in its time argument .    in any case , the free energy will be obtained as a sum of infinite terms , each one corresponding to a given value of the index @xmath77 , @xmath79 where @xmath80\\;.\\ ] ]    in the special case of @xmath81 , we may split the free energy according to its origin being the scalar ( @xmath82 ) or vector ( @xmath83 ) fields : @xmath84 while for @xmath65 , we only have contributions originated in a vector field @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "this contribution to the free energy is composed of two independent terms , @xmath87 , each one of them can be obtained from the calculation of a path integral over an ( unconstrained ) real field , namely : @xmath88 and @xmath89 } \\;.\\ ] ] the functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath72 are model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , since by assumption we have a vacuum between the plates , we can write : @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 where we have introduced the constants : @xmath95 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are entirely determined by the parameters of the model used for the permittivity .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the two contributions above are decoupled , to consider and present the corresponding results separately below . before doing this , it is instructive to discuss the limit of perfectly conducting materials for the scalar and vector contributions .",
    "the @xmath96 field behaves as a scalar , and when the infinite permittivity limit is taken , its gradient inside the region occupied by the mirror vanishes .",
    "thus the field is constant in that region ; assuming that the conductors are grounded , that constant vanishes , so that the field itself is zero .",
    "that is , this field becomes a dirichlet mode , corresponding to the transverse magnetic ( tm ) em mode .",
    "the vector zero mode , on the other hand , behaves as an em field in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "if @xmath97 , say , tends to infinity , then the that em field will vanish identically on the region occupied by that mirror .",
    "it then has perfect conductor boundary conditions at @xmath98 .",
    "( of course , the same will happen on the other surface if the corresponding constant tends to infinity . ) but we have shown this to be equivalent to a real scalar field with neumann conditions  @xcite . therefore , this is a neumann mode , corresponding to the transverse electric ( te ) em mode .",
    "we first note that a formal result of the functional integral for this mode can be written in terms of the determinant of an operator @xmath100 : @xmath101^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\nonumber\\\\ { \\mathcal k}_s & = & - \\partial_j \\widetilde{\\epsilon}^{(0)}({\\mathbf x } ) \\partial_j \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected a global constant which does not contribute to the interaction energy between the mirrors .    within the de approach to the second order , @xmath102",

    "the calculation is already a standard one , we omit the detalis .",
    "the result is : @xmath115 where @xmath116 as expected , in the limit @xmath117 one obtains the result corresponding to a scalar field in @xmath6 dimensions satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions times @xmath118 @xcite .      the first order term , @xmath119 , is not required in order to determine the de ; however , we calculate it in order to have a consistency check for some of the ingredients we use in our work .",
    "we first note that @xmath99 can be conveniently written in an equivalent form where the zeroth order term is extracted explicitly , @xmath120 where @xmath121 contains all the perturbative corrections : @xmath122 the average symbol is given by a functional integral with the action corresponding to @xmath123 : @xmath124 here , @xmath125 and @xmath126 then , the first order term becomes : @xmath127 where the first - order term in the action , @xmath128 , is given by @xmath129 thus , @xmath130 where we have introduced the objects : @xmath131 on the other hand , the correlation function which coincidence limit appears above , is ill - defined when one of the indices @xmath132 equals @xmath133 .",

    ", when inserting this identity in eq.([f2vv ] ) , the term proportional to @xmath225 reads , up to order @xmath226 , @xmath227 for small values of @xmath205 we have @xmath228 and @xmath229 , and therefore the integral above is logarithmically divergent in the infrared .",
    "this result shows that the ntlo correction to pfa for the zero - frequency vector mode is non - local as long as @xmath230 is different from zero .",
    "unlike for magnetic materials , a finite value of @xmath230 does not regulate the infrared divergence .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that the reflection coefficient @xmath231 as @xmath232 , for any value of @xmath230 .",
    "in this paper we have analysed in detail the zero - frequency contribution to the casimir free energy in the presence of real materials .",
    "we used a functional approach , and clarified the use of the temporal gauge in the context of the casimir effect , since it that does not fix the zero frequency mode of @xmath169 .",
    "this mode does in fact generate a tm contribution to the free energy .",
    "we have also computed the kernels that are necessary to obtain the de of the casimir free energy , in order to discuss the validity of the de for real materials .",
    "we have shown that the tm contribution does always produce a ntlo correction to the pfa , which is local in derivatives of the function @xmath10 that defines the shape of the curved interface .",
    "the same happens for the te contribution in the case of magnetic materials .",
    "there is only one situation where the de would fail , that is , when @xmath233 as @xmath234 _ for both mirrors _ @xcite",
    ". in terms of the models usually considered in the casimir literature to describe real materials , this condition corresponds to the plasma model .    in summary , the non - analyticities we observed for perfect conductors in our previous work @xcite , survive only under the assumption of perfectly lossless materials .",
    "related with this , in recent works @xcite it has been claimed that the lifshitz - matsubara formula does not apply for the plasma model , and that it should be understood as the lossless limit of the drude model ( note however that this claim has been contested in ref .",
    "if this were the case , then @xmath235 would vanish , and there would be no vector ( or te ) contribution to the zero mode . consequently , the ntlo correction to pfa would be local even in this lossless limit .",
    "this work was supported by anpcyt , conicet , uba and uncuyo .",
    "in this appendix we outline the calculation of @xmath236 using the scattering approach . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown that @xmath237\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath238 denote the two polarizations , @xmath239 are the fresnel reflection coefficients and @xmath240 we are assuming here that both media have the same em properties .",
    "the crucial ingredients in the above formula are the coefficients @xmath241 and @xmath242 , which describe the scattering of a classical em wave at the rough interface between two homogeneous half - spaces .",
    "these coefficients have been computed in ref.@xcite using small - slope perturbation theory .",
    "the notation there is slightly different : @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "the situation where both media have the same permittivity @xmath0 is obtained by setting @xmath245 and @xmath246 in the results of ref.@xcite .    as the general formula for @xmath247",
    "has not been explicitly displayed in previous works , and is needed for the analysis of the emergence of non - analyticities of the de , we will work it out here .",
    "the coefficients @xmath241 are given in eq.(4.15 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "one can check that , as we are considering the zero - frequency mode , they vanish for @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , @xmath247 in eq.([f2v ] ) has two separate contributions : @xmath249 and @xmath250 , which correspond to the scalar @xmath251 and vector @xmath252 contributions , respectively .",
