    "random schrdinger operators are used as models for disordered quantum mechanical systems . in particular , the anderson model was introduced to describe the motion of a quantum - mechanical electron in a crystal with impurities . for this model , the states corresponding to an absolutely continuous spectrum describe mobile electrons .",
    "thus , an interval of absolutely continuous spectrum is an energy range in which the material is a conductor .",
    "an outstanding open problem , the extended states conjecture , is to prove existence of absolutely continuous spectrum for the lattice @xmath0 with @xmath1 . until now",
    ", it is only for the bethe lattice that this has been established .",
    "a first result on the topic was obtained by a. klein ,  @xcite , in @xmath2 ; he proved that for weak disorder , on the bethe lattice , there exists absolutely continuous spectrum for almost all potentials .",
    "more recently , aizenman , sims and warzel proved similar results for the bethe lattice using a different method ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "their method establishes the persistence of absolutely continuous spectrum under weak disorder and also in the presence of a periodic background potential .",
    "during the same time , froese , hasler and spitzer introduced a geometric method for proving the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum on graphs ( see  @xcite ) . in their second paper on the topic ,",
    "@xcite , they proved delocalization for the bethe lattice of degree @xmath3 using this geometric approach .    in this work , we provide a version of the geometric method on a more general class of trees .",
    "we prove the existence of purely absolutely continuous spectrum for the anderson model on a tree - like graph , @xmath4 , defined as follows ( see figure [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "tree ]    let @xmath5 be an infinite full binary tree in which each node has degree @xmath3 except for the origin , which has degree @xmath6 . let us call its nodes principal nodes and denote by @xmath7 its origin . for the origin and each principal node",
    "there are two edges leading away from the origin .",
    "choose one of them and call it the top edge and call the other the bottom edge . on each top edge ,",
    "we add @xmath8 distinct auxiliary nodes ; similarly we add @xmath9 , @xmath10 , distinct auxiliary nodes on each bottom edge .",
    "thus we obtain the tree @xmath4 which has a set of principal nodes denoted by @xmath11 and a set of auxiliary nodes denoted by @xmath12",
    ".    the conclusions in this paper remain valid if we start with any k - nary tree .",
    "we present the binary case for simplicity . by excluding the @xmath13 case we break some of the symmetry in our tree ; this asymmetry is used in proposition 4 , section 3 .",
    "the proof for the @xmath14 case would constitute a generalization of the bethe lattice proof presented in  @xcite and be considerably longer .    using the terminology established in  @xcite , we will use the symbol @xmath4 for both our tree graph and its set of vertices . for each @xmath15",
    "we have at most one neighbor towards the root and two in what we refer to as the forward direction .",
    "we say that @xmath16 is in the future of @xmath17 if the path connecting @xmath18 and the root runs through @xmath19 .",
    "the subtree consisting of all the vertices in the future of @xmath19 , with @xmath19 regarded as its root , is denoted by @xmath20 .    the anderson model on @xmath4",
    "is given by the random hamiltonian , @xmath21 , on the hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "this operator is of the form @xmath23 where :    1 .",
    "the free laplacian @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 where the distance @xmath26 denotes the number of edges between sites .",
    "2 .   the operator @xmath27 is a random potential , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a family of independent , identically distributed real random variables with common probability distribution @xmath30 .",
    "we assume the @xmath31 moment , + @xmath32 , is finite for some @xmath33 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath34 measures the disorder .",
    "our main theorem states that the above defined anderson model exhibits purely absolutely continuous spectrum for low disorder .",
    "main let @xmath35 be the open interior of the absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath24 ( this spectrum depends on @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) with a finite set of values , @xmath36 , removed . for any closed subinterval @xmath37 , @xmath38",

    "_ @xmath41 the finite set @xmath36 will be properly identified in proposition [ p3.1 ] .",
    "@xmath42 the actual definition we use for @xmath35 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the indicator function at the origin ) .",
    "defined like this , @xmath35 is the support of the absolutely continuous component of the spectral measure of @xmath24 for @xmath45 without the special values contained in @xmath36 . following the ideas in lemma [ lx ] ( section  [ appa ] ) , i.e. rearranging the tree and deriving a formula for the green function at the new origin , we can prove that the set @xmath46 is , in fact , the support of the pure absolutely continuous spectrum for the laplacian @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the indicator function supported at the site @xmath17 and let @xmath48 be a strip along the real axis , for @xmath37 defined in the previous theorem .",
    "the following theorem together with the criterion from section  [ appa ] gives us the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "t3.2under the hypothesis of the previous theorem , we have @xmath49 for all sufficiently small @xmath33 , some @xmath50 and all @xmath17 .",
    "* proof of theoreom [ main ] .",
    "* let us consider @xmath51 .",
    "using fatou s lemma , fubini s theorem and theorem [ t3.2 ] , we obtain @xmath52 therefore we must have @xmath53 with probability one . since @xmath54 is the stieltjes transform of the measure @xmath55 , it follows from proposition [ simon ] , section 5 that the restriction of @xmath56 to @xmath37 is purely absolutely continuous with probability one . in other words , the spectral measure for @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath57 , for any @xmath17 , is purely absolutely continuous in @xmath37 with probability one .",
    "therefore the operator @xmath21 has purely absolutely continuous spectrum on @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the diagonal matrix element of the resolvent at some arbitrary vertex @xmath17 , often referred to as the green function .",
    "our goal is to find bounds for these green functions .",
    "we first do so for @xmath59 and then extend the bound to all diagonal terms .",
    "let @xmath60 be the restriction of @xmath21 to @xmath61 .",
    "the forward green function @xmath62 is defined to be the green function for the truncated graph , given by @xmath63        the forward green function @xmath62 , for @xmath19 a principal node , can be expressed recurrently as a function depending on the forward green function for the two forward principal nodes and all the random potentials in between .",
    "thus the recurrence relation , which can be derived using resolvent properties , has the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the nodes @xmath69 and the potentials @xmath70 involved in the recurrence are shown in figure [ fig.2 ] . because the origin has degree 2 , the recurrence relation for @xmath71",
    "is given by @xmath72 .    in the above definition @xmath73",
    "is the complex upper half plane .",
    "notice that since @xmath21 is random , at each @xmath17 , the forward green function @xmath62 is an @xmath74-valued random variable .",
    "we notice that since the random potential is i.i.d .",
    ", at any @xmath75 , @xmath62 has the same probability distribution denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "the green function at the origin , @xmath77 , has probability distribution denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "the transformations @xmath79 and @xmath80 , in the recursion formula , are compositions of fractional linear transformations , hence fractional linear transformations themselves .",
    "this implies @xmath81 is a rational function whose numerator and denominator have degree @xmath6 . if @xmath82 , the map @xmath83 is an analytic map from @xmath74 to @xmath74 , a hyperbolic contraction .",
    "let @xmath84 denote its unique fixed point in the upper half plane , a solution to the cubic equation @xmath85 .",
    "the set @xmath86 is a reunion of two disjoint open intervals on the real axis .",
    "thus , for @xmath87 , @xmath88 for all @xmath75 and @xmath89 .",
    "the map @xmath90 extends continuously onto the real axis . therefore we define @xmath91 where , as mentioned before , @xmath36 is defined in proposition [ p3.1 ] .",
    "we should note again that the set @xmath92 is the support of the absolutely continuous component of the spectral measure for @xmath45 , for the free laplacian .",
    "the set @xmath93 is a compact curve strictly contained in @xmath74 .",
    "thus , when @xmath94 lies in the strip @xmath95 with @xmath96 closed and @xmath97 sufficiently small , @xmath98 is bounded below and @xmath99 is bounded above .    to prove absolutely continuous spectrum , we need the bound on @xmath100 stated in theorem 2 . to get this bound",
    "we first prove that @xmath101 is bounded , where @xmath102 is a weight function defined as follows : @xmath103 up to constants , @xmath104 is the hyperbolic cosine of the hyperbolic distance from @xmath105 to @xmath84 , the green function at the root for @xmath24 .",
