    "vega - like systems , first discovered by _ iras _ , are main sequence stars surrounded by dust .",
    "the operation of the poynting - robertson effect on micron - sized grains , responsible for much of the observed infrared excess , requires that the lifetime of these particles be significantly shorter than the age of the stars ( backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the dust grains must be replenished from a reservoir such as collisions between larger bodies or the sublimation of comets .",
    "studies of vega - like systems thus afford the opportunity to study the evolution of large solids such as planets , comets , and asteroids .",
    "the identification of dust around main sequence a - type stars is usually made from the iras colors ( e.g. mannings & barlow 1998 ; silverstone 2000 ) . identifying objects with 12 @xmath0 m excess is difficult because the photosphere usually dominates the total flux at this wavelength .",
    "the bulk of the dust associated with main sequence a - type stars typically has temperatures t@xmath7 @xmath6100 k , and semi - major axes @xmath850 au .",
    "for example , imaging of hr 4796a ( a0v , distance from earth 67.1 pc ) in thermal infrared ( koerner et al . 1998 ; jayawardhana et al . 1998 ) and in near infrared scattered light ( schneider et al . 1999 ) , revealed a dust ring with radius 70 au , a distance scale similar to that of the sun s kuiper belt .",
    "dust grains located @xmath65 au from a main sequence a - type star have @xmath9 300 k , producing strong 12 @xmath0 m excesses .",
    "searches for 12 @xmath0 m excesses around main sequence stars have revealed that 300 k dust around a - k dwarfs is rare . in a survey of 548 a - k dwarfs ,",
    "aumann & probst ( 1991 ) were able to identify iras 12 @xmath0 m excesses only with @xmath10 pictoris and @xmath1 lep (= hr 1998 = hd 38678 ) .",
    "similarly , cot ( 1987 ) derived unusually high temperatures for the dust around @xmath1 lep compared to other vega - like main sequence stars from iras 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath0 m observations .",
    "although coronagraphic images of @xmath10 pic ( kalas & jewitt 1995 ) have revealed a massive dust disk which extends to a radius of almost 1000 au , no extended disk has been discovered around @xmath1 lep .",
    "we have carried out a high resolution mid - infrared imaging study to learn about the dust properties , and the origin and evolution of the dust around @xmath1 lep .",
    "@xmath1 lep is a main sequence a3vn star with a _",
    "hipparcos _ distance of 21.5 pc and a fractional dust luminosity , l@xmath11/l@xmath12 = 1.7@xmath1310@xmath14 ( fajardo - acosta , telesco , & knacke 1998 ) .",
    "it has been identified as a member of the castor moving group , which also contains fomalhaut and vega , based upon its kinematic properties ( barrado y navascus 1998 ) .",
    "barrado y navascus ( 1998 ) estimates its age to be between 100 - 400 myr from the lithium abundance of later - type stars in the castor moving group and from the space motion of the group .",
    "recently , song et al . (",
    "2001 ) estimated an age of 50 - 350 myr using stromgren @xmath15 photometry corrected for the effects of rapid rotation , to determine stellar parameters ( effective temperature @xmath16 , surface gravity @xmath17 and metallicity ) which then are fit to stellar evolutionary tracks of schaller et al .",
    "lachaume et al . ( 1999 ) fit the position of @xmath1 lep on the h - r digram with theoretical isochrones of bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and estimate a slightly older age of 200 - 500 myr .",
    "our data were obtained on the night of 2001 february 5 ( ut ) at the keck i telescope using the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) , which was built by a team led by b. jones and is described on the keck website .",
    "the lws uses a 128@xmath13128 sias bib array with a scale at the keck telescope of 0.08@xmath18 pixel@xmath19 and a total field of view of 10.2@xmath2010.2@xmath18 .",
    "we used the `` chop - nod '' mode of observing and two different filters : 11.2 - 12.2 @xmath21 and 16.9 - 18.9 @xmath21 .",
    "we used capella ( @xmath22 aur ) for flux and point - spread function calibrations .",
    "the data were reduced at ucla using standard lws routines .",
    "we flux calibrate our data using the results for capella that @xmath23(11.5 @xmath0 m ) = 176.1 jy and @xmath23(19.3 @xmath0 m ) = 67.5 jy ( gezari et al .",
    "1987 ) extrapolated to our bands assuming that @xmath24 between 10 and 20 @xmath0 m . for @xmath1 lep , we find f@xmath25(11.7 @xmath0 m ) = 1.60@xmath260.20 jy and f@xmath25(17.9 @xmath0 m ) = 0.93@xmath260.07 jy in agreement with previous observations by fajardo - acosta et al .",
    "we conservatively estimate the uncertainties associated with our measurements from the drift in the flux of capella before and after our observations of @xmath1 lep . since less time elapsed between our observations of the standard star at 17.9 @xmath0 m , the percentage errors are smaller at this wavelength .",
    "determining the infrared excess of @xmath1 lep requires subtracting a model for the stellar photosphere from the observed fluxes .",
    "we model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of @xmath1 lep with a 1993 kurucz stellar atmosphere , assuming solar metallicity ( [ z / h]=0.0 ) .",
    "we assume no interstellar extinction because the star is only 21.5 pc from the sun . we assume negligible circumstellar extinction since @xmath27 @xmath6 @xmath28 and we have no evidence in our data for an edge - on system .",
    "we find a best fit ( minimum @xmath29 ) for the following parameters : stellar effective temperature t@xmath30 = 8500 k and surface gravity @xmath31 = 4.5 ( see figure 1 ) . with this fit ,",
    "we find photospheric fluxes of f@xmath25(11.7 @xmath0 m ) = 1.24@xmath260.01 jy and f@xmath25(17.9 @xmath0 m ) = 0.53@xmath260.01 jy ; thus , we find 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m excesses of 0.36@xmath260.2 jy and 0.40@xmath260.07 jy respectively .",
    "we convolve models for the dust distribution with the point spread function ( psf ) of capella at 17.9 @xmath0 m to estimate the maximum distance of the dust from the star .",
    "observations of capella made 40 minutes before , 20 minutes after and 100 minutes after our observations of @xmath1 lep varied somewhat .",
    "we use the psf measured closest in time to our observations of @xmath1 lep to construct our analysis .",
    "we assume the the dust is confined to a face - on ring , with an average distance of 0.10@xmath18 , 0.24@xmath18 or 0.40@xmath18 from the star and a width ranging between 0.20@xmath18 and 0.24@xmath18 , and that 55% of the power is emitted by the point source and 45% of the power is emitted by the ring , consistent with our model for the photosphere and the total flux measured from @xmath1 lep .",
    "we find a best fit for the model with the smallest dust disk ( average radius 0.10 ) .",
    "the models including larger disks do not fit the surface brightness for the central pixel or the surface brightnesses for the outer pixels well .",
    "thus , we estimate a maximum dust distance of 6 au from the star .",
    "when models for the dust distribution are convolved with the psf from earlier or later in the evening , the dust could extend as far as 9 au from the star .",
    "the minimum grain distance can be constrained from the temperature of the grains assuming that they are black bodies .",
    "we estimate a grain temperature of 320 k from the ratio of the 11.7 @xmath0 m excess to the 17.9 @xmath0 m excess .",
    "black bodies in radiative equilibrium with a stellar source are located a distance @xmath32 from the central star ( jura et al .",
    "1998 ) , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the effective temperature of the stellar photosphere and the stellar radius .",
    "we estimate the stellar luminosity from the bolometric magnitude using the _ hipparcos _ v - band magnitude ( @xmath35 = 3.55 mag ) and distance ( 21.5 pc ) and a bolometric correction ( flower 1996 ) corresponding to an effective temperature @xmath16 = 8500 k. for @xmath1 lep , we find a stellar luminosity @xmath36 = 14 @xmath37 .",
    "the stellar radius is therefore @xmath34 = 1.7 @xmath38 . from equation ( 1 ) and",
    "the stellar properties summarized in table 1 , we find a minimum grain distance of 2.8 au",
    ".    we can additionally infer the dust temperature and distance by fitting a black body to the mid infrared fluxes reported for wavelengths longer than 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "we find a best fit ( minimum @xmath39 ) for the photosphere subtracted fluxes for @xmath40 = 230 k and d = 5.4 au , consistent with our observations .",
    "a lower limit to the size of dust grains orbiting a star can be found by balancing the force due to radiation pressure with the force due to gravity . for small grains with radius @xmath41 ,",
    "the force due to radiation pressure overcomes gravity for : @xmath42 ( artymowicz 1988 ) where @xmath36 and @xmath43 are the stellar luminosity and mass , @xmath44 is the radiation pressure coupling coefficient and @xmath45 is the density of an individual grain . since radiation from an a - type star is dominated by optical and ultraviolet light , we expect that @xmath46 and therefore the effective cross section of the grains can be approximated by their geometric cross section so @xmath47 . based upon @xmath16 and @xmath36 , the inferred stellar",
    "mass is 1.9 @xmath48 ( siess , dufour , & forestini 2000 ) . with @xmath45 = 2.5 g @xmath49 , the minimum radius for grains orbiting @xmath1 lep is @xmath41 = 1.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "we can estimate the average size of the grains assuming a size distribution for the dust grains .",
    "analogous to the main asteroid belt in our solar system and as expected from equilibrium between production and destruction of objects through collisions ( greenberg & nolan 1989 ) , we assume @xmath50 with p @xmath51 3.5 ( binzel , hanner , & steel 2000 ) .",
    "if we assume a minimum grain radius of 1.7 @xmath0 m , we find an average grain radius @xmath52 = 2.8 @xmath0 m , if we weight by the number of particles .",
    "we can estimate the minimum mass of dust around @xmath1 lep assuming that the particles have @xmath52 @xmath6 2.8 @xmath0 m ; if the grains are larger , then our estimate is a lower bound .",
    "if we assume a thin shell of dust at distance , d , from the star and if the particles are spheres of radius , @xmath41 , and if the cross section of the particles equals their geometric cross section , then the mass of dust is @xmath53 ( jura et al .",
    "1995 ) where @xmath54 is the luminosity of the dust .",
    "if d = 6 au , @xmath45 = 2.5 g @xmath49 , and @xmath52 = 2.8 @xmath0 m , then @xmath55 = 1.6@xmath1310@xmath56 g.      one mechanism which may remove particles is poynting - robertson drag .",
    "the poynting - robertson lifetime of grains in a circular orbit , a distance @xmath57 from a star is @xmath58 ( burns et al .",
    "1979 ) . with the parameters given above and",
    "@xmath36 = 14 @xmath37 , the poynting - robertson lifetime of the grains is @xmath59 = 1.3@xmath60 years . since this timescale is significantly shorter than the stellar age ( @xmath61 ) , we hypothesize that the grains are replenished through collisions between larger bodies . by analogy with the solar system , we propose that the parent bodies are asteroids .",
    "we can estimate the total mass contained in parent bodies around @xmath1 lep assuming a steady state .",
    "if @xmath62 denotes the mass in parent bodies , then we may write @xmath63 with @xmath64 g , @xmath65 yr and @xmath66 yr , we estimate a total mass of parent bodies @xmath67 g , approximately 200 times the mass of the main asteroid belt in our solar system ( binzel et al .",
    "2000 ) . from equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) ,",
    "we find @xmath68 since l@xmath11 is well measured , our estimate for the lower limit on the mass of parent bodies , @xmath62 , is better constrained than our estimate for the mass of observed dust .",
    "@xmath1 lep is distinctive because the dust around it is warm and close to the star compared to the dust in other well known debris disk systems : @xmath10 pictoris , hr 4796a , vega , and fomalhaut .",
    "we can quantify this difference by comparing the ratios of 60 @xmath0 m excess to the 25 @xmath0 m excess . for @xmath1 lep ,",
    "this ratio is at least a factor of 2 smaller than for any of the other stars considered ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the lack of dust at distances greater than 6 au raises the possibility of the presence of a planet , sculping the disk and confining the dust .",
    "such a planet could increase the eccentricity of the orbits of the putative asteroids and thus drive them into mutual collisions to produce the observed dust .",
    "we have obtained high resolution mid infrared images of @xmath1 lep at 11.7 @xmath0 m and 17.9 @xmath0 m using the lws on the keck i telescope .",
    "@xmath1 lep possess a strong mid infrared excess which is at most marginally resolved and thus surrounding dust probably lies within 6 au although some dust may extend as far as 9 au .",
    "this result is consistent with the temperature of the grains derived from the mid - infrared photometry .    \\2 .",
    "since the estimated poynting - robertson lifetime of grains with @xmath52 = 2.7 @xmath0 m is @xmath69 yr , significantly shorter than the age of @xmath1 lep , the grains must be replenished from a reservoir such as collisions between larger bodies , perhaps asteroids . for @xmath1 lep",
    ", we robustly estimate that the minimum mass of parent bodies is @xmath67 g assuming that the system is in a steady state .",
    "this mass is approximately 200 times the mass of the sun s main asteroid belt .",
