    "linear response theories have been an important tool for studying transport and dynamic properties of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "although there have been myriad successful examples in classical or non - interacting systems , developing a linear response theory for complex systems or strongly correlated systems could be quite a challenge . as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is difficult to obtain consistent expressions of the compressibility of an interacting electron gas from the derivatives of thermodynamic quantities and from the correlation functions . a naive calculation of the response functions of bcs theory of conventional superconductors could have led to a violation of the charge conservation .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the superfluid phase further complicates the treatment of any linear response theory of bcs superfluids .",
    "thus it requires more sophisticated treatments @xcite to obtain the response functions that respect conservation laws .    here",
    "we analyze two consistent linear response theories of bcs superfluids in great details and review the importance of gauge invariance , the ( generalized ) ward identity , sum rules , and how they impose constraints on response functions .",
    "also crucial is an additional @xmath1-limit ward identity @xcite which is related to the compressibility sum rule .",
    "the non - interacting fermi gas satisfies all constraints , albeit in a trivial sense . in the presence of interactions",
    ", we will focus on a linear response theory which we call consistent - fluctuation - of - the order - parameter ( cfop ) theory for fermionic superfluids .",
    "importantly , at the mean - field level , this approach is consistent with all conservation laws and associated sum rules .",
    "this will set up a solid foundation for the generalization to the more general theories of bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "we also present a spin linear response theory in a systematic manner to demonstrate that fundamental constraints including the sum rules and ward identities are also satisfied in the spin channel .",
    "one major difference between the density and spin response functions is that in the superfluid phase the order parameter , which corresponds to the condensate of cooper pairs , breaks only the symmetry associated with the density response functions , but not the symmetry associated with the spin response function",
    ". therefore the density response function exhibits richer structures across the superfluid phase transition .",
    "this is the base for constructing an order - parameter like quantity that measures the  spin - charge separation \" in a bcs superfluid as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there have been two major approaches for addressing the linear response of fermionic bcs superfluids .",
    "the first one is attributed to nambu @xcite , who reformulated the problem in the two - dimensional nambu space and pointed out that if certain types of corrections to the em interacting vertex are considered consistently with those corrections to the self - energy in the green s function , the gauge invariance can be maintained explicitly .",
    "nambu presented a generalized form of ward identity ( gwi ) and proposed an integral equation for the full electromagnetic ( em ) interacting vertex in the nambu space .",
    "he stated that this em vertex must satisfy the gwi without giving a proof and we present our own proof in appendix  [ app : b0 ] . by solving this integral equation at small frequency and momentum limits",
    ", it was shown that the excitations of collective modes correspond to the poles of the density response function .",
    "hence the many - particle effects are indeed included in the corrections of em vertex . despite many virtues , this method is relatively difficult to implement .",
    "firstly , it is very hard to solve the integral equation for the vertex .",
    "if one truncates the integral equation , one may not get a gauge invariant solution and can not even find the correct collective - mode excitations .",
    "secondly , this approach was formulated in the nambu space and it is difficult to translate the results in the two - dimensional nambu space to their counterparts in the one - dimensional representation space of fermion operators .",
    "this limits its applicability to more general problems such as bcs - bec crossover .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the gwi discussed in nambu s original paper @xcite is not a unique constraint for gauge invariance of bcs theory . in other words ,",
    "nambu s method is not specific to bcs theory : it is more general but harder to obtain an exact solution .",
    "there is yet another approach which we call the cfop approach with a totally different structure when compared to nambu s method .",
    "our goal is to explain this approach and test its results against some fundamental constraints . within this approach",
    ", we treat the gauge transformation and the fluctuations of order parameter on equal footing , such that many - particle effects are also explicitly included in the em vertex .",
    "this approach was first proposed by kadanoff and martin@xcite in a less complete form .",
    "they only considered the fluctuations of the order parameter , and tried to decompose the three - particle green s functions in a way that can respect gauge invariance .",
    "it was then independently formulated in several unrelated papers by betbeder matibet and nozieres @xcite and kulik et al .",
    "@xcite in a more complete form where both phase and amplitude fluctuations are considered .",
    "later on , zha and levin@xcite revisited it and presented three identities of response functions , which are now known to be part of the wis for response functions .",
    "recently , it was again proposed in the keldysh formalism with time - ordered green s functions in ref .",
    "@xcite . a similar derivation using a kinetic - equation formalism",
    "is also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we cast this formalism in a more systematic and covariant form .",
    "we will present more virtues of this approach , such as the consistency with the @xmath1-limit ward identity and the @xmath4-sum rule .",
    "the em vertex and its generalized form can be both found in different representation spaces . a comparison between nambu s method and the cfop theory will also be presented .",
    "we will show that the cfop approach is indeed a consistent and manageable linear response theory for bcs superfluids .",
    "the generalization of the cfop theory to relativistic bcs superfluids can be found in ref .",
    "besides linear response theories discussed here , one may find more discussions on the gauge invariance of bcs superconductors in terms of effective field theories in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ c1 ]",
    "we briefly discuss the general symmetries in the theory of two - component fermi gases with contact interactions . in section  [ c2 ]",

    "the generators of the these transformations are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the space spanned by the nambu spinor @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the pauli matrices .",

    ", one needs to couple the fermion field by an external vector field @xmath33 which transforms as @xmath34 , @xmath35 . for the u(1)@xmath0 symmetry ,",

    "the external field @xmath47 has a different physical meaning from that in the density channel .",

    "@xmath52 is the difference between the spin - up and the spin - down currents , i.e. , the magnetization current .",
