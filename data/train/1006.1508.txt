    "over the course of the last decade , work by a number of groups has led to the development of a widely accepted picture for the formation of the first stars , the so - called population iii ( or pop .",
    "iii ) stars . in this picture , the very first stars ( population iii.1 in the nomenclature of @xcite and @xcite ) form within small dark matter halos that have total masses @xmath0 , virial temperatures of around a thousand k , and that are assembled at redshifts @xmath130 or above @xcite .",
    "gas falling into one of these small dark matter halos is shock - heated to a temperature close to the virial temperature of the halo , and thereafter cools via h@xmath2 rotational and vibrational line emission .",
    "the h@xmath2 that enables the gas to cool is primarily formed via the gas - phase reactions @xmath3 where the required free electrons are those that remain in the gas after cosmological recombination at @xmath4 .",
    "the low abundance of these electrons , plus the fact that the gas starts to recombine further once it collapses into the dark matter halo , limits the amount of h@xmath2 that can form in this manner ; the typical fractional abundances of h@xmath2 that result are a few times @xmath5 .",
    "the limited h@xmath2 abundance , the low critical density of the h@xmath2 molecule , and the large energy separation of its lowest accessible rotational levels combine to significantly limit the extent to which the gas can cool .",
    "the minimum temperature reached depends upon the dynamical history of the collapse , but is typically around @xmath6 .",
    "this minimum temperature is reached at a density of around @xmath7 , comparable to the critical density of h@xmath2 ( the density at which its level populations reach their local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) values ) , and at higher densities , the gas begins to reheat .",
    "gas falling into the dark matter halo therefore tends to fragment once it reaches this temperature and density , and the resulting fragments have masses of the order of the local jeans mass , @xmath8 . following this period of fragmentation , the gas in the fragments undergoes a further period of gravitational collapse , eventually reaching a density of @xmath9@xmath10 , at which point three - body h@xmath2 formation becomes effective .",
    "this rapidly converts almost all of the available atomic hydrogen into h@xmath2 , but the significant energy release that accompanies this process heats the gas , which typically attains a temperature of 10002000  k during this phase of the collapse",
    ".    continued collapse next leads to the gas becoming optically thick in the main h@xmath2 cooling lines ( at @xmath11 ; @xcite , @xcite ) , the onset of collision - induced emission cooling ( at @xmath12 ; @xcite ) , and finally to the gas becoming optically thick in the continuum as well as in the h@xmath2 lines ( @xmath13 ; @xcite ) .",
    "dissociation cooling allows for further collapse , but once all of the h@xmath2 is gone , the collapse becomes fully adiabatic .",
    "detailed simulations of the collapse , using adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ; see e.g.  @xcite ) or smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; see e.g.  @xcite ) show little or no evidence for fragmentation between @xmath14 and the onset of this adiabatic evolution , and it is natural to associate the latter with the formation of a primordial protostar .",
    "the amount of gas incorporated into the protostar at this point is small , approximately @xmath15 , but it is surrounded by a massive , dense envelope and hence begins to accrete rapidly . if the envelope does not fragment , and if accretion onto the protostar is unhindered by radiative feedback , then the final mass of the star can be very large .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate that its mass could lie anywhere in the range @xmath16@xmath17 , depending on the environment and dynamical history of the gas .",
    "the degree to which feedback will suppress accretion remains uncertain , but the most effective potential feedback mechanisms , lyman-@xmath18 scattering and photoionization @xcite become important only once the mass of the star exceeds 20  m@xmath19 .",
    "the expectation is therefore that all population iii.1 stars were massive , with masses typically of the order of @xmath20 or more , thereby also explaining why none of these stars appear to have survived until the present day .",
    "if a population iii.1 star of this mass does form , then it will rapidly dissociate h@xmath2 throughout the halo , thereby suppressing further star formation @xcite .",
    "this fact , together with the lack of fragmentation seen in the simulations , is often taken to imply that only a single population iii.1 star will form in each dark matter halo .",
    "this widely accepted picture for population iii star formation also provides for a second mode of pop .",
    "iii star formation .",
    "this occurs in metal - free gas which has been ionized by radiation from a previous generation of population iii stars . following the death of these stars , the gas recombines , and the elevated fractional ionization in the recombining gas allows more h@xmath2 to form .",
    "the enhanced h@xmath2 fraction enables the gas to cool to a lower temperature , which in turn increases the effectiveness of cooling by the singly - deuterated hydrogen molecule , hd . in the standard pop .",
    "iii.1 scenario , hd cooling is of limited importance , but in this second scenario , termed population iii.2 star formation by @xcite , it becomes dominant , cooling the gas down to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "the lower gas temperature , plus the higher critical density of hd ( @xmath21 , compared with @xmath22 for h@xmath2 ) , means that fragmentation occurs somewhat later , and produces significantly lower mass fragments , with characteristic masses @xmath23 .",
    "subsequently , the evolution of these fragments is believed to proceed in the same fashion as described above , resulting ultimately in the formation of a primordial protostar of similar mass . however , since this protostar is embedded in a less massive envelope , with a lower accretion rate , the final stellar mass is thought to be an order of magnitude or so smaller , @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , this still corresponds to what we would call , by galactic standards , a massive star , and moreover one which is more than capable of dissociating h@xmath2 throughout a large volume of the halo , thereby suppressing further star formation .    in the past few years",
    ", it has become possible to partially test this picture using numerical simulations that begin with the proper cosmological initial conditions and follow the collapse of the gas all the way to protostellar densities .",
    "these simulations confirm that fragmentation during the initial collapse phase is ineffective : in general , only a single protostar forms , although in roughly 20% of cases , the gas fragments into two clumps , forming a wide binary ( @xcite ; m.  turk , private communication ) .",
    "however , most of these studies were prevented by technical limitations from following the evolution of the infalling gas after the formation of the first protostar .",
    "the technical problem involves the hydrodynamical timestep : as the collapse is followed down to protostellar densities , this becomes extremely short ( @xmath25 ) , making it computationally infeasible to follow the evolution of the surrounding dense gas over any significant time period .    in studies of contemporary star formation",
    ", a similar problem is avoided by the use of sink particles @xcite . when gravitationally bound regions of gas collapse below the scale on which they can be spatially resolved , they are replaced in the simulation by a sink particle of the same mass .",
    "this can accrete gas from its surroundings , but otherwise interacts only via gravity .",
    "recent simulations of population iii star formation that have used sink particles to allow the evolution of the gas to be followed beyond the formation of the first protostar consistently find evidence for more extensive fragmentation than is assumed in the conventional picture of population iii star formation ( @xcite ; clark et  al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "if fragmentation is as common as these results suggest , and most population iii stars form in multiple systems rather than as single stars , then this has profound implications for the final masses of the stars , their production of ionizing photons and metals , the rate of high redshift gamma ray bursts , and many other issues .",
    "it is therefore important to better understand the physical basis of fragmentation in these systems . to do this",
    ", we would ideally like to have a large sample of simulations , as basing our arguments on only one or two realizations of population iii star formation leaves one open to the possibility that these realizations may not be typical .",
    "unfortunately , simulations starting from cosmological initial conditions and following collapse all the way to protostellar densities are computationally costly , making it difficult to explore a large region of parameter space . in these simulations , it is also difficult to be certain about which aspects of the included physics are the most important for driving fragmentation .",
    "simulations that start from simpler initial conditions and that focus on exploring the importance of a single free parameter therefore play an important role , which is complementary to that of fully cosmological simulations .",
    "a good example is the recent work by machida and collaborators @xcite which examined the influence of the initial rotational energy of the gas , and found that zero metallicity clouds with sufficient initial rotational energy could fragment into tight binaries .",
    "another example , and one which explores a much lower density regime , is the study by @xcite , who showed that the fragmentation behavior depends sensitively on the adopted density profile of the primordial halo .    in this paper , we perform a similar study into the effects of the initial turbulent energy of the gas .",
    "our motivation comes from the fact that recent high - resolution cosmological simulations have shown that the self - gravitating regions in which pop .",
    "iii star formation occurs contain significant turbulent motions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from studies of present - day star formation",
    ", we know that such turbulent motions can lead to the fragmentation of initially marginally unstable gas clouds , and so it is instructive to investigate how such conditions could affect the ` standard ' picture of primordial star formation . in a pop .",
    "iii analogue of the studies on present - day star formation , we will look at how subsonic turbulence affects the collapse of marginally super - critical bonnor - ebert spheres , in an attempt to quantify the effects of turbulently induced fragmentation on the mass function of pop .",
    "iii stars .",
    "central to this study will be the use of the sink particles to allow us to capture the evolution of the gas cloud beyond the collapse of the first region .",
    "the paper is laid out in the following manner .",
    "our modifications to the cosmological sph code gadget 2 @xcite are outlined in  [ sec : gadget2 ] ( with further details of the chemical networks and heating and cooling described in the appendix ) .",
    "the initial conditions for this numerical experiment are described in ",
    "[ sec : ics ] , including the definitions of pop .",
    "iii.1 and iii.2 that are used in our study .",
    "the details of the fragmentation process seen in the simulations are discussed in  [ sec : frag ] and the long - term chemical and thermodynamical evolution of the infalling envelope are described in  [ sec : evol ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of this study for the initial mass function ( imf ) of primordial stars in  [ sec : chat ] , and summarize the main points of this paper in  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we model the evolution of the gas in our simulations using a modified version of the gadget 2 smoothed particle hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "we have modified the publicly available code in several respects .",
    "first , we have added a sink particle implementation , based on the prescription in @xcite , to allow us to follow the evolution of the gas beyond the point at which the first protostar forms .",
    "our particular implementation is derived from the one first described in @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the ideas behind the algorithm here .",
    "the actual numerical values used for the parameters discussed here are given later , in ",
    "[ sec : ics ] .",
    "sink particles are not really added to the code in the sense that a new particle is introduced , but instead a normal sph particle is turned into a sink particle once certain criteria have been met .",
    "the particle undergoes a series of tests once it has reached a threshold density .",
    "the first is to see whether the candidate sph particle is sufficiently far away from any other sinks , measured in terms of the sink particle s accretion radius , @xmath26 .",
    "we adopt a conservative value of @xmath27 .",
    "next , we check to see whether the smoothing length of the particle is less than the ` accretion radius ' of the sink particle that it will become .",
    "this ensures that when the sink particle forms it can instantly accrete at least @xmath28 neighboring particles ( we adopt 50 neighbors in these simulations ) .",
    "the third test is to make sure that the candidate sink particle and its neighbors are on the same integration time - step .",
    "once these three preliminary criteria are met , the dynamical state of the possible sink particle and its neighbors are assessed to ensure that the particles are indeed undergoing gravitational collapse and are not about to re - expand from their dense state .",
    "this takes the form of a further four tests .",
    "firstly , we require that    @xmath29    where @xmath18 is the ratio of the thermal energy to the magnitude of the gravitational energy of the particles .",
    "secondly , we ensure that    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the ratio of rotational energy to the magnitude of the gravitational energy .",
    "the third condition is that the total energy of the particles must be negative ( which actually renders the above checks redundant , but can help to improve the computational efficiency of the code ) .",
    "finally , the forth test is that the divergence of the accelerations must be less than zero .",
    "this final check ensures that the group of particles is not in the process of being tidally disrupted or bouncing .",
    "if all of these tests are passed , the particle becomes a sink and the mass and linear momentum of the neighbors are added to the sink particle .",
    "as the simulation progresses , the sink particles are then allowed to accrete other gas particles that fall within the accretion radius .",
    "as in the bate et al .",
    "( 1995 ) prescription , several tests must be passed before any sph particles can be accreted by the sink .",
    "first , it must obviously be bound and moving toward the candidate sink .",
    "second , in the case where there is more than one sink present , it must be more bound to the candidate sink than any other sink in the simulation .",
    "finally , the sph and sink particles need to be on the same integration time - step ( to ensure temporal momentum conservation ) .",
    "once these conditions are passed , the mass and linear momentum of the sph particle are added to the sink particle .",
    "note that accretion onto existing sink particles is done _ before _ any new candidate sinks are considered .",
    "in addition to the sink particles , we have also implemented an external pressure term ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that enables us to model a constant pressure boundary , as opposed to the vacuum or periodic boundary conditions that are the only choices available in the standard version of gadget .",
    "we modify the standard gas pressure contribution to the gadget 2 momentum equation ,    @xmath32 , \\ ] ]    by replacing @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , where @xmath37 is the external pressure , and all quantities have the usual meaning , consistent with those used by @xcite .",
    "the pair - wise nature of the force summation over the sph neighbors ensures that @xmath37 cancels for particles that are surrounded by other particles . at the edge , where the term does not disappear",
    ", it mimics the pressure contribution from a surrounding medium .",
    "the values of @xmath37 used in this study are @xmath38 for the pop iii.1 clouds , and @xmath39 for the pop iii.2 clouds , where @xmath40 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "these confining pressures are similar to the internal pressure of the clouds in each case ( see the temperatures and densities in  [ sec : ics ] below ) .",
    "finally , we have added a treatment of primordial gas chemistry and cooling to the code . to model the thermal evolution of the gas",
    ", we use an operator - split formalism , which treats the effects of radiative and chemical heating and cooling separately from compressional heating .",
    "the influence of radiative and chemical heating and cooling on the thermal energy of each particle can thus be formulated as an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) , which can then be solved simultaneously with the chemical rate equations ( also odes ) that describe the chemical evolution of the gas .",
    "as @xcite have previously discussed , the strong coupling between the chemical and thermal evolution of high density primordial gas that results from the importance of three - body h@xmath2 formation heating and h@xmath2 collisional dissociation cooling renders it vital to treat cooling and chemistry simultaneously ; treatments that do not do so will produce numerically stable results only with great difficulty .",

    "we assume that the turbulence considered here has its origin in gravitationally driven flows that arise as the gas and dark matter virialize in mini - halos ( wise & abel 2007 ; greif et al .",
    "2008 ; klessen & hennebelle 2010 ) .",
    "as the gas is compressible in nature the turbulent velocity field will have a power spectrum that is somewhat steeper than the standard kolmogorov ( 1941 ) description for incompressible flows .",

    "we also prevent sink particles from forming within @xmath67 of one another .",
    "this prevents the formation of sinks out of gas that in reality would by accreted by a neighboring sink particle before it could go into direct collapse by itself .",
    "lastly , gravitational interactions between sinks , and between the sinks and the gas , are softened in the standard way in gadget 2 , using a fixed softening parameter of 5 au for the sinks , and a variable softening parameter for the gas particles that is equivalent to their smoothing length .",
    "we note that the sink algorithm employed here does not allow sink particles to merge , in contrast to the ` sticky ' sinks introduced in bromm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . as such",
    ", our simulations may be biased towards low masses .",
    "small , secondary sinks could be driven towards more massive ones via dynamical friction and coalesce with them .",
    "this effect , which acts to reduce the resulting number of fragments , has been seen in amr simulations of massive star forming regions in the present - day universe ( krumholz et  al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "however , given the size of our sink particles , it is unclear whether sink - merging is really applicable : the protostellar radius is at most expected to be 0.5 au ( and then only for a short time , e.g. @xcite ) , which is significantly smaller than both our adopted accretion radius and the gravitational softening . in fact , in the simulations from present - day star formation in which extremely small sink particles are used  along with little , or no softening  merging events are found to be fairly rare ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they do however occur , and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the results of this study .",
    "also , given the size of our sink particles , we are unable to resolve any of the disks that would invariably form around the young protostars and it has been suggested that such structures would be unstable to fragmentation on these scales ( e.g. @xcite ) . finally , our calculations do not include any model for the feedback processes that accompany the formation of a young star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given these uncertainties , the sink particles are unable to say exactly what the shape of the final imf will be , but rather measure how the gas can fragment at a given scale ( our resolution ) , and how these fragments are likely to evolve , assuming feedback processes play only a minor role over the timescales investigated in this study .",
    "these caveats should be borne in mind when interpreting the results in the following sections .",
    "in our comparison of the different simulations performed in this study , we will compare the properties of the clouds after roughly 10 percent of their mass has been accreted ( although in some cases we will mention in passing what happens as the simulations are advanced further ) . in terms of looking at the ability of the clouds to fragment , comparing the different simulations at this point in their evolution",

    "we can see that the clouds with @xmath68 fragment into small clusters of sink particles ; the runs with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 form 5 , 31 and 15 sink particles respectively .",
    "these calculations clearly demonstrate that turbulent subsonic motions are able to promote fragmentation in primordial gas clouds . only in the case with @xmath72 does the cloud form just a single sink particle . in this case",
    "an extended disk builds up around the star , since the seed turbulence gives rise to some low level of rotation in the collapsing core , but otherwise the gas contains little structure .",
    "interestingly , there is no clear trend linking the number of fragments that form and the initial turbulent energy : the 0.4 run fragments more than the 0.8 run , despite containing only one quarter of the initial turbulent energy .",
    "the effects at play here are somewhat complex .",
    "first , the turbulent velocity field contained in the collapsing region will differ with each value of @xmath73 , since the different strengths of flow will push the gas around to different degrees .",
    "in addition , the nature of the turbulence that survives in the collapsing core will also affect the fragmentation . as we see from the images in fig .",
    "[ fig : image3.1 ] , the cloud with @xmath74 ",
    "the most successful in terms of fragmentation  forms a large disk - like structure . as we will discuss in  [ sec : evol ] , this configuration appears to aid the fragmentation of the infalling envelope .",
    "therefore , much of the cloud s ability to fragment depends on the level of rotation that happens to become locked - up in the collapsing region .",
    "further , and to a lesser degree , the extra delay in the collapse caused by the increased turbulent support also gives the cloud more time to wash out anisotropies in the gas ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tsf ] for the collapse times ) .",
    "thus the ability of the cloud to fragment is a competition between these conflicting processes .",
    "for the randomly generated velocity field that we used in this study , the ability to fragment is better for @xmath75 , than @xmath76 , but we note that this may not always be the case . we stress that to make a quantitative statistical statement about the number of fragments that form as a function of the turbulent mach number , we would need to run a series of different realizations of the turbulent velocity field in each case .",
    "such a comparison lies outside the scope of our current study .",
    "the mass functions of the sink particles from the simulations that undergo fragmentation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinkmf ] . for clarity",
    ", we have omitted the single 100 sink particle that forms in the 0.1 cloud . for the 0.2 and 0.8 clouds",
    ", we see that the sink masses cluster around some central value  roughly 12 and 4 respectively  while the 0.4 cloud has a mass function that is skewed to lower masses , with a peak at around 1 , a sharp fall - off below this , and a broad distribution towards higher masses , extending up to around 13 .",
    "we emphasize that the mass functions presented here ( as well as in fig .",
    "10 ) do not yet represent the final imfs , as they correspond to an intermediate time in the overall accretion process , where only 10% of the cloud has been accreted .",
    "they also might be affected by the numerical details of our sink technique , in particular the absence of any sink - sink mergers , as discussed in section  3 .",
    "the reason for the spread of masses becomes apparent when we look at the accretion properties of the sink particles , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maccp1 ] . focusing on the 0.4 and 0.8 runs , and looking at the evolution of the individual sinks in more detail",
    ", we see that some appear to accrete rapidly and then suddenly stop .",
    "this behaviour is typical of what is seen in simulations of bound , fragmenting cores in the context of present - day star formation @xcite , and is a result of velocity kicks from dynamical three ( or more ) body interactions .",
    "the mass accretion rate in such a system @xcite is given by @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the mass of the sink particle , @xmath79 is the gas density , and @xmath80 is the velocity of the sink particle relative to the gas .",
    "the ability of a sink to accrete more mass from the available reservoir is significantly reduced once its velocity increases .",
    "the effect is then exacerbated by the fact that an increase in velocity results in the sink particle moving to a more distant orbit ( or even being kicked out of the system entirely ) and hence into a position where the gas density is lower . since this sink",
    "particle is now in a position where further accretion is difficult , its siblings are able to accrete its ` share ' of the mass reservoir , with the majority going to those few sinks that sit right in the middle of the cloud s potential well . in general , as the sinks accrete from the background gas , they tend to move towards the centre , due to mass - loading .",
    "further , their increased mass makes them more likely to survive dynamical encounters with their less massive siblings . as such , the ` rich get richer ' , with a few sinks ending up significantly more massive than the rest .",
    "the process is typically termed ` competitive accretion ' , @xcite and normally leads to the type of distribution of masses seen in our 0.4run ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sinkmf ] ) .",
    "looking at the mass evolution of the individual sink particles , we also see that the formation of new sink particles occurs in bursts .",
    "the turbulence generates structure in the gas which is enhanced by the gravitational collapse as the gaseous envelope falls in towards the central system of sink particles .",
    "the bursts in sink formation reflect the moments when these structures detach from the flow and become self - gravitating in their own right .",
    "figure  [ fig : maccp1 ] also shows the accretion rate of the cluster as a whole , and how that compares to an estimate made from the radial infall profile . to construct this estimate ,",
    "we first compute the mass infall rate as a function of the radial distance @xmath81 from the densest sph particle : @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the gas density in a spherical shell with radius @xmath81 and width d@xmath81 , and @xmath84 is the radial velocity of the gas in this shell and all quantities are volume - averaged .",
    "given the enclosed mass as a function of radial distance , @xmath85 , it is straightforward to convert from @xmath86 to an infall rate as a function of enclosed mass , @xmath87 , which we identify with the total mass accretion rate of the system of sink particles . figure  [ fig : maccp1 ] demonstrates that this estimate provides a fairly close match to the actual accretion rate onto the sink particle population , except at very early times , which is a numerical artifact : the sink particles instantly accrete all gas within their accretion radius when they form . at later times , the main difference between the estimated accretion rate and the true accretion rate is that the latter is significantly noisier , owing to the bursts of sink formation and the clumpiness of the infalling gas .",
    "finally , we note that the accretion rates are also fairly insensitive to the level of turbulence in the cloud , suggesting that random turbulent motions with the magnitudes considered here should not lead to a variation in the overall accretion rates of primordial stars or star clusters from minihalo to minihalo .",
    "other sources of support against gravity , such as rotation and magnetic fields ( assuming the latter can be efficiently generated , as in @xcite and @xcite ) , are likely to play a greater role in regulating the accretion rate .",
    "indeed , the important role played by rotation in regulating the infall and accretion of gas can be appreciated if we compare the accretion rates measured in our simulations with those estimated or measured in previous studies of pop .",
    "iii star formation starting from more realistic cosmological initial conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "iii.2 channel is cooler at number densities around @xmath43 @xmath44 , with a typical temperature of around 75k , the same initial number of jeans masses requires that the clouds have a lower mass of 150 .",
    "the column density distribution in these clouds after 10 percent of the gas has been accreted by the sink particles is shown in the column density images in fig .",

    "iii.1 channel that gives rise to the first stars in the universe .",
    "the main reason why this mode of star formation is less susceptible to fragmentation has to do with the thermal evolution of the gas as it collapses . in fig .",

    "iii.2 cases , taken from the simulations with @xmath88 .",
    "the elevated @xmath89 and hd fractions in the pop .",
    "iii.2 simulations do not provide enough cooling to keep the gas close to the cmb temperature at these densities , owing to the increasing inefficiency of the hd as a coolant as it nears the critical density at which the populations of its rotational level reach their local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) values .",
    "the gas therefore heats up significantly as it collapses , increasing its temperature from 75  k at @xmath90 to roughly 700  k at @xmath91 , corresponding to evolution that is almost adiabatic .",
    "this sharp increase in temperature temporarily increases the local jeans mass at the center of the cloud , and significantly slows the collapse , giving the turbulence in the cloud time to decay . in the absence of additional physical processes",
    "able to replenish the turbulence , there is nothing to sustain the density inhomogeneities in the cloud that act as the seeds for later fragmentation ( since they are not yet self - gravitating ) , and so the end result is a collapse with a much lower level of fragmentation than in most of the pop .",
    "iii.1 simulations .",
    "a similar effect has previously been noted by @xcite in their study of fragmentation in very metal poor gas clouds .",
    "they find that for metallicities of around @xmath92 , heat input due to three - body h@xmath2 formation at @xmath93 leads to a sharp jump in the gas temperature , which delays the collapse , reduces the elongation of the collapsing core , and suppresses any fragmentation .",
    "furthermore , @xcite also briefly addressed this issue in their study of pop .",
    "iii.2 star formation , and showed that their simulated pop .",

    "[ fig : rhotevol ] .",
    "such a rapid increase in the temperature during the initial collapse makes generating structure in the gas difficult , helping to remove any anisotropies introduced by the turbulent flows .",

    "the temperature - density plots show the same behavior as reported in @xcite .",
    "the particle evolution appears to diverge at a density of around @xmath96@xmath44 , with one group of sph particles heating up to a maximum temperature of around 7000k and the other staying around 1500k and cooling significantly at higher densities . as discussed in @xcite , the hot part of the diagram corresponds to gas that falls in at a later stage in the evolution of the cloud . at that point ,",
    "the enclosed gas mass is larger than at earlier times , and so the free - fall velocity is correspondingly larger .",
    "the gas therefore shocks more strongly than at early times , causing it to become hot enough to collisionally dissociate its h@xmath2 rapidly . with",
    "the h@xmath2 gone , there is nothing to cool the gas until its temperature reaches @xmath97 . at this point ,",
    "lyman-@xmath18 cooling becomes effective , allowing it to resist further heating .",
    "although we see the same trends in both the pop .",
    "iii.1 and pop .",
    "iii.2 cases , in the latter the amount of gas departing from the ` standard ' temperature - density evolution is significantly reduced , since the elevated @xmath89 fractions allow the post - shock gas to cool more effectively , limiting the temperature rise and allowing more of the gas to retain its h@xmath2 .    from the accompanying graphs we see that the @xmath89 is rapidly dissociated as the temperature rises , but given the relatively low amounts of @xmath89 present in the gas at these densities , the cooling provided by the dissociation is clearly unable to offset the compression .",
    "however we see that at higher densities the @xmath89 suddenly reforms , coinciding with the region in the temperature - density diagrams where the gas is cold .",
    "this prompts the question of whether the cold gas is the result of an isochoric cooling instability , brought on by rapid @xmath89 formation ? does the turbulence trigger an instability that naturally exists in pure primordial gas , but that is less effective in gas that has been influenced by the presence of previous star formation ?    by harnessing the lagrangian nature of sph , the plots in fig .  [ fig : ptrace ] shed some light on this issue .",
    "they show the temporal evolution of the density , temperature and @xmath89 fraction for several sph particles that eventually become sink particles , and as such trace the conditions in the gas in the run - up to gravitational fragmentation and collapse . again",

    "iii.2 cloud , the five lines represent all of the sink formation that occurs between the formation of the first and last sinks .",
    "the figure shows a number of interesting features .",
    "first , we see that none of those sph particles destined to become sinks undergo the rapid rise in temperature  and accompanying loss of @xmath89  that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] .",
    "in contrast , their temperatures remain close to the temperatures found within the first collapsing core ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rhotevol ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the cool particles seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] do not come from regions that undergo shock heating and subsequent loss of @xmath89 .",
    "instead , we see that they come from regions of gas that first undergo a relatively quiescent collapse , before being involved in several expansions and contractions .",
    "the fact that this first stage of the density evolution is fairly slow needs to be stressed : the free - fall times at densities of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are approximately 1600 yr and 500 yr , respectively . as such",
    ", these particles are not experiencing as much compression as those that end up losing their @xmath89 .",
    "in fact we see that they actually have a higher than average @xmath89 fraction , when we compare them with the lower right - hand plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : evol ] , a property that helps them remain fairly cool as they collapse .",
    "the reason why they experience less compression is that they are collapsing in a rotating structure that has been formed during the collapse of the turbulent gas .",
    "the evolution of these particles and their immediate surroundings alters abruptly once they enter the dynamically complicated swirling regions that we can see in the column density figures .",
    "first , they collide with other material , which results in a sharp increase in their temperature and density .",
    "this increase in the density in turn increases the rate of @xmath89 formation , which very rapidly turns them fully molecular . as they re - expand , the adiabatic cooling and the now significantly enhanced @xmath89 line - cooling act together to reduce the temperature . in some cases",
    "this happens several times , but for all of these particles , the end result is the same and they find themselves in a clump of gas that is now jeans unstable and fully molecular : the perfect conditions for forming a new protostar .",
    "interestingly , we see similar behaviour leading up to the formation of the sink particles in both the pop .",
    "iii.1 and iii.2 clouds . the relative lack of fragmentation in the pop .",
    "iii.2 case simply results from the lack of structure in the collapsing envelope , rather than any thermal properties of the gas at these high densities .",
    "the calculations presented in this study suggest that the first stars in the universe may form in small dense clusters , provided that the turbulent initial conditions we adopt are close to those found in minihalos .",
    "this suggests that the population  iii imf covered a broad range in masses , possibly exhibiting a scale - free , power - law extension similar to the present - day case .",
    "previous arguments in favor of a peaked imf , in the shape of a narrow gaussian or even a delta function , would then need to be revisited ( e.g. , bromm & larson 2004 ) . although a similar prediction can be drawn from the study of clark et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter cgk08 ) , there are some subtle differences .",
    "our present study employs a fully self - consistent treatment of the thermodynamics , rather than the piece - wise polytropic equation of state ( eos ) approach used by cgk08 , which was taken as a fit to the detailed one - zone calculations of @xcite . although both start with similar ( pop .",
    "iii.1 ) initial conditions , the fragmentation seen in the current simulations has a different origin . in the self - consistent treatment employed here ,",
    "the fragmentation is driven by the complicated thermodynamics of high density clumpy gas as it enters the disk - like regions that surround the first protostar .",
    "in contrast , the fragmentation in cgk08 was evident at much lower densities , with the turbulent flows forming structures that were enhanced during the collapse , and rotation providing a ` window of opportunity ' for those structures to become gravitationally unstable in their own right , rather than being simply accreted onto the central protostellar core .",
    "note however that the simulations in cgk08 also contained systematic , solid - body rotation in the initial conditions , which we do not study in this paper .",
    "this may help some of the structure to survive .    in general ,",
    "the calculations presented in this paper suggest that the structure formed early on in the collapse is less likely to survive when the full thermodynamical behavior of the gas is taken into account .",
    "this is evident in the fact that the current calculations yield significantly fewer fragments than the pop iii simulations in cgk08  25 sink particles for 19 of accreted gas in cgk08 , compared to 31 sink particles for 100 of accreted gas in the current study .",
    "one feature that should be stressed ( and which was originally pointed out in @xcite ) is that the long - term thermodynamic evolution of the envelope differs significantly from the one - zone models .",
    "this brings into question the practice of using a piece - wise barotropic eos as a proxy for the full thermodynamics in simulations that intend to study the evolution of the gas beyond the collapse of the first protostellar core .    assuming that the turbulent initial conditions used in this paper are indeed representative of the gas in minihalos , it is worth considering the implications of the fragmentation that we see .",
    "the mass spectrum of the fragments in our calculations ranges from a few 0.1 to a few 10 .",
    "we would not expect stellar feedback to change this result significantly , since previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that feedback becomes effective at limiting accretion onto pop .",
    "iii protostars only for protostellar masses greater than about 20 .",
    "however , such feedback effects are expected to become important , and in particular to suppress further fragmentation ( e.g. , krumholz et al . 2009 ) during the further evolution of the cloud .",
    "the fragments will then likely grow in mass , and possibly even merge with each other .",
    "it is very difficult to extrapolate to the final situation where accretion and merging stops .",
    "but our main result that the population  iii imf was likely broad seems robust .    as we have discussed above , it is difficult to reach any definitive conclusions regarding the final population  iii masses and the resulting imf",
    ". it appears at least possible , however , that in rare cases truly metal - free stars with masses less than @xmath100 could have formed , and would still be present in the milky way today , thus providing a unique opportunity to directly probe the physical conditions at the end of the dark ages with galactic observations . current models of hierarchical galaxy formation predict that the first and most metal - poor halos to merge will become part of the bulge component of the resulting spiral galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore highly interesting to survey the bulge of the milky way for extremely metal - poor and metal - free stars .",
    "however , this is also very challenging as the bulge is far away , has high stellar density , and contains a wide range of stellar populations of all ages and metallicities .",
    "the odds of finding a few truly metal - free stars amongst millions of other stars are very low , or even zero due to pollution from the interstellar medium ( frebel et al .",

    "on the other hand , there may be subtle selection effects at work that bias current surveys against finding pisn - enriched stars ( karlsson et al .",
    "the basic argument here is that pisne have such high metal yields that abundances in stars that form out of this material are already quite high ( see greif et al .",

    "iii.2 case is seen in this study , caused by the inhomogeneities introduced by the turbulence . * in the cases where fragmentation is efficient ( in particular the pop iii.1 cloud with turbulent rms velocity @xmath74 ) , the masses of the fragments extend over a large range , which results in a distribution of stellar masses exhibiting a power - law extension towards high mass , as seen in the present - day imf @xcite",
    ". however it should be noted that the exact form of the sink particle mass function may depend on our assumed initial conditions ( see appendix  [ icdiscuss ] ) and the simplifications employed in the sink particle implementation itself . * due to the relative lack of fragmentation in the pop .",

    "* fragmentation tends to occur in gas which has temperatures of around 200 ",
    "400  k at densities above @xmath105 , significantly lower than the 1000  1500  k associated with the collapse of the first core .",
    "such cold temperatures are a result of the expansion that occurs as gas enters the rotating , disk - like regions around the central core , coupled with relatively high fractions of @xmath89 , which can provide efficient line - cooling .",
    "these rotating structures are themselves a consequence of the angular momentum that is present in the turbulence .    in summary , we propose that if even small levels of turbulence , with velocity dispersions of order 20% of the sound speed or more , are present in the baryonic component of dark matter minihalos , primordial stars are likely to be born in small stellar groups , rather than in isolation , and to have a wide range of stellar masses .",

    "we write the h@xmath2 cooling rate in optically thick gas as @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the number density of hydrogen molecules in upper energy level @xmath169 , @xmath170 is the energy difference between this upper level and a lower level @xmath171 , @xmath172 is the spontaneous radiative transition rate for transitions between @xmath169 and @xmath171 , and @xmath173 is the escape probability associated with this transition , i.e.  the probability that the emitted photon can escape from the region of interest . we take values for the level energies from the compilation made available by p.  g.  martin on his websitepgmartin / h2.html ] and for the radiative transition rates from @xcite , and we fix @xmath168 by assuming that the h@xmath2 level populations are in lte .",
    "the problem of modelling optically thick h@xmath2 cooling thereby reduces to one of computing the escape probability for each transition .",
    "we follow @xcite and write the escape probability for the transition @xmath174 as @xmath175 where we approximate @xmath176 as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the line absorption coefficient and @xmath179 is the soloblev length . in the classical , one - dimensional spherically symmetric case , the sobolev length is given by @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the thermal velocity , and @xmath182 is the radial velocity gradient . in our inherently three - dimensional flow ,",
    "we generalize this as @xmath183 following @xcite .",
    "if the velocity dispersion of the gas is very small , then @xmath179 can become very large , much larger than the size of the collapsing core . to ensure that we do not reduce the h@xmath2 cooling rate in this case to an artificially low value",
    ", we take as our actual length scale in equation  [ tau ] the smallest of the soloblev length and the local jeans length , @xmath184 .    since the line absorption coefficient @xmath178 is linearly proportional to the number density of h@xmath2 , we can write @xmath176 as @xmath185 where @xmath186 is an effective h@xmath2 column density , and where @xmath187 is a function only of temperature .",
    "we therefore tabulate the cooling rate per h@xmath2 molecule in the optically thick limit as a function of two parameters : the gas temperature @xmath188 and the effective h@xmath2 column density @xmath189 , and compute cooling rates during the simulations by interpolation from a pre - generated look - up table .    at densities",
    "@xmath190 , a second form of h@xmath2 cooling becomes important , called collision - induced emission .",
    "although h@xmath2 molecules have no electric dipole , the interacting pair in a collision of h@xmath2 with h , he or h@xmath2 briefly acts as a ` supermolecule ' with an non - zero electric dipole , and a hence a non - zero probability of emitting or absorbing a photon through a dipole transition . because the collision time is very short ,",
    "the resulting collision - induced transition lines are very broad , effectively merging into a continuum ( for more details , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we include this process in our cooling function , using a rate taken from @xcite .",
    "we crudely account for the reduction of the cie cooling rate by continuum absorption at very high number densities using the following prescription ( m. turk , private communication ) @xmath191 where @xmath192",
    "however , we note that optical depth effects do not strongly affect the cie cooling rate for densities below our threshold for sink particle creation ( see  [ sec : ics ] ) , and so the approximate nature of this opacity cutoff is unlikely to significantly affect our results .",
    "in addition to h@xmath2 ro - vibrational line emission and cie cooling , our cooling function contains a number of other radiative processes : electronic excitation of h , he and he@xmath46 , cooling from the recombination of h@xmath46 and he@xmath46 , compton cooling and bremsstrahlung .",
    "details of our treatment of these processes can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also account for changes in the thermal energy of the gas due to changes in its chemical makeup .",
    "specifically , we include the effects of cooling due to the collisional ionization of h , he and he@xmath46 , and due to the destruction of h@xmath2 by charge transfer and by collisional dissociation , as well as heating due to the three - body h@xmath2 formation .",
    "the balance between cooling due to h@xmath2 collisional dissociation and heating due to three - body h@xmath2 formation plays a very important role in regulating the thermal evolution of the gas at densities @xmath193 .",
    "given our somewhat arbitrary choice of initial conditions , it is prudent to ask whether they are applicable to primordial star formation , and in particular , whether the choice of the initial density profile affects the details of the collapse . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] , we show , for the pop iii.1 clouds with 0.1 and 0.4 @xmath60 turbulence , the number density and enclosed mass as a function of radius and how the radial velocity and temperature varies as a function of the enclosed mass . in the case of the 0.1@xmath60 cloud ,",
    "the radial profiles ( mass and number density ) are much like those presented for the standard pop iii studies @xcite , in which fully cosmological initial conditions were used . in particular , by the time that the first sink particle forms in this run , the gas has developed the same @xmath194 radial density profile as found in the fully cosmological runs , demonstrating that the density profile at this stage is insensitive to the shape of the initial density profile .",
    "we do however see differences between the radial velocity and temperature profiles , compared to those published in the literature .",
    "the infall velocities at this stage are somewhat higher than those seen in fully cosmological studies , but it should be noted that we do not include systemic rotation in our study , and so a major source of support is missing .",
    "however , aside from the higher values of the radial velocity , the shape of the profile is also different . in the runs presented in this study , the infall velocities of the shells enclosing 1 and greater are systematically higher than those seen in the cosmological simulations published to date , with a peak in the radial velocity profile at about 10 - 100 ( depending on the level of turbulent support ) instead of around 0.3 .",
    "some of this difference in the radial velocity profiles is reflected in the somewhat steeper than reported temperature profiles , since the gas will reacts to the increased @xmath195 heating .",
    "however the temperature profiles are also affected by the differences in the chemistry , and in particular , our choice of the three - body h@xmath2 formation rate .",
    "so the obvious question is , do our high infall velocities make fragmentation more likely than it would be reality ? to address this , we performed another pop iii.1 simulation with 0.4 @xmath60 turbulence , but this time we set the confining external pressure to a factor of 4 less than was used in the original simulations .",
    "the radial and enclosed mass profiles at the point just before the first sink particle is formed are shown as the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ( right - hand panel ) .",
    "we see that radial velocity profile is affected by the change in boundary pressure , resulting in a factor of 4 reduction in the infall speed .",
    "compared to the original run , which formed 31 sink particles , this simulation forms 22 sinks when 10 percent of the gas has been accreted .",
    "while this suggests that the fragmentation we see is sensitive to the details of the collapse , and we are likely overestimating the number of fragments formed ( at least at the scale of our sink particles ) when one compares to the standard pop iii collapse profiles , it seems that this is not the main cause of the fragmentation .",
    "the gas still fragments , and the processes leading up to the fragmentation are the same as those discussed in ",
    "[ sec : evol ] .",
    "finally , we note that there is also new evidence to suggest that the radial collapse profiles seen in the literature so far , may not be representative of all pop iii star formation .",
    "for example , while the radial density profiles from the studies by @xcite and @xcite are similar to the newer , higher - resolution , cosmological simulations of @xcite and @xcite , the radial ( or enclosed mass ) profiles of the other quantities in the newer calculations show considerable variation .",
    "in particular , the velocity and temperature profiles in @xcite lie somewhere in between those found by @xcite and our 0.4 @xmath60 turbulent cloud .",
    "a very high - resolution study of the onset of the initial gravitational instability in the baryonic component of dark matter minihalos , may help to establish whether these differences between the studies of , say , @xcite and @xcite are due to the increased resolution and improved physical treatment used in the latter study ( e.g.  the inclusion of the effects of three - body h@xmath196 formation heating ) , or just reflect the effects of cosmic variance .",
