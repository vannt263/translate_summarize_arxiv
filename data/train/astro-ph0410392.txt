    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect is due to the re - scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the hot electrons situated in intracluster media  @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that it should provide a reliable mechanism for selecting a sample of clusters  @xcite and a number of instruments sensitive to the microwave frequency range ( 15ghz-350ghz ) are under construction to perform this task  @xcite .",
    "since the cluster mass function is sensitive to cosmological parameters  @xcite such surveys are likely to be an important part of the program to probe the late - time history of the universe , searching for the origin of the apparently accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the number of clusters as a function of redshift and flux is a strong function of @xmath0 , the mass density of the universe in units of the critical density , and @xmath1 , the normalization of the matter power spectrum on scales of @xmath2 , and is a weaker function of the hubble constant @xmath3 , the equation of state @xmath4 of the dark energy , q , and its evolution @xmath5 . here ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined by @xmath6 .",
    "it has been shown that the degeneracies within the space of cosmological parameters are such that cluster surveys are complementary to those which might be obtained using observations of type ia supernovae at high redshift  @xcite .",
    "since the distribution of the clusters obeys poisson statistics the errorbars deduced on the cosmological parameters will be very sensitive to the number of clusters found in a given survey .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that finding the largest number of clusters possible for a given integration time will be close to giving the best constraints on cosmological parameters , although this may also weakly depend on their distribution with redshift .",
    "clearly a survey which will find @xmath7 clusters will constrain cosmological parameters much better than one which finds @xmath8 . having a much larger sample",
    "would also seem desirable in terms of reducing the systematic errors due to the poorly understood gas physics .",
    "fortunately , we will show that , by assuming we can model the gas physics well , one can get to within a factor of two of the optimal situation for a total power measurement .",
    "this is more tricky in more complicated experimental situations such as beam switching whereby an ill - judged selection of the survey depth can lead to one finding very few clusters at all .",
    "the goal of this paper , therefore , is to discuss issues related to optimizing the yield of a given survey ; the optimum being defined as the survey in which the largest number of objects are found in a given amount of observing time .",
    "this is a question one is always faced with in any kind of astronomical measurement : how long does one integrate for on a given patch of sky ?",
    "obviously the shorter the required integration time for individual patches , the more sky area can be covered . however ,",
    "if one does nt integrate long enough only the very brightest objects will be found .",
    "clearly , one is always guided in such situations by one s expectations of what is there to be observed .",
    "for the present case of clusters , one can attempt to make a simple estimate by assuming ( 1 ) the clusters are point - like objects in the telescope beam , ( 2 ) their comoving number density is constant and ( 3 ) the universe is euclidean . in this case",
    "the number of objects with flux density , @xmath9 , greater than the limiting flux density of a survey @xmath10 is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angular coverage .",
    "since for fixed total integration time @xmath13 , one can deduce that @xmath14 , and hence a survey with largest possible area ( that is , the whole sky ) would be optimal in this case . under these assumptions",
    "the survey would be flux density limited and hence an instrument with the largest possible collecting area would be optimal in terms of making the largest number of detections in the shortest period of time .    unfortunately , in most cases clusters are unlikely to be point - like , nor is their comoving density likely to be constant due to evolution and , of course , the universe is not euclidean .",
    "as we will describe in section  [ distn ] , the distribution of clusters as a function of mass and redshift can be modelled in a sensible way for a given set of cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the key to understanding the issue at hand here is how the limiting mass of a survey is related to the instrumental noise and the angular resolution of the telescope .",
    "shallow surveys , as suggested by the simple estimate above , will only find clusters which are very large and close by , and such clusters cover many beam areas . since the same signal is spread over a number of beam areas , such objects can dip below the detection threshold even though they are very large .",
    "it is clear that this effect will compete with that due to euclidean source counts in our initial estimate , leading to an optimum at a particular value of the noise and angular coverage .",
    "we will show that this optimum will depend on the size of the beam : larger beam sizes , say @xmath15 , will require a deeper survey to achieve the optimum , whereas a much shallower survey will be optimal for much smaller beam sizes , say @xmath16 .",
    "essentially the optimal situation is for most of the clusters in the survey to be the same size as the beam as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "once the beam is sufficiently small to resolve all the clusters , the survey becomes surface brightness temperature limited , rather than being flux density limited , and increasing the collecting area no longer acts to increase the rate of detection .",
    "this illustrates an interesting feature of cluster survey , which is in contrast to intuition one might have from considering standard point sources and , as we shall see , leads to some other somewhat counter - intuitive conclusions .",
    "in section  [ mass ] we will discuss how to derive a relation for the limiting mass of the survey as a function of redshift and the limiting flux , incorporating the effects of a gaussian beam profile .",
    "our initial motivation is to model idealized total power measurements using a single dish with a circular aperture .",
    "we will allow the observations to be smoothed using a window function which is exactly tuned to every possible cluster size above the maximum resolution of the telescope . under these assumptions",
    "we show in section  [ total ] that for a particular minimum beam size there exists a unique value of the noise which corresponds to the optimum in terms of the total of clusters detected , and for all beam sizes less than around @xmath17 ( fwhm ) this is equivalent in terms of the number of clusters found in the survey , although the precise optimum noise will be different for different beam sizes .",
    "accurate total power measurements are only feasible in space or at a very dry site ( for example , the south pole ) on the earth s surface , mainly due to the effects of water vapour . in section",
    "[ real ] we discuss how our calculations can be adapted to situations closer to those experienced in reality .",
    "in particular , we will illustrate how our calculations can be applied to techniques which minimize the effects of the atmospheric contamination which is ubiquitous at the relevant frequencies at most sites .",
    "these techniques involve either use of a beam switch or an interferometric array .",
    "for the most part our conclusions are similar to those for a total power experiment , although more care is required in interpreting them .",
    "obviously our goal has some clear dangers since one is , by necessity , required to assume a specific distribution of clusters . in situations where the source population is completely unknown , attempts at optimizing observations in this way are completely useless !",
    "however , the distribution and precise characteristics of clusters are becoming much better understood ; something which is only likely to improve as observations progress .",
    "we have , therefore , used the so - called concordance cosmological parameters  @xcite and have attempted to model most of the relevant features of the distribution of clusters . in section",
    "[ robust ] we test the robustness of our predictions to variations in the cosmological parameters and in the cluster model .",
    "small variations do not affect the optimum significantly but , not surprisingly , large variations substantially change our predictions .",
    "we quantify this in terms of the parameters .",
    "of particular concern is the uncertainty in the detailed modelling of the poorly understood gas physics within the cluster .",
    "it is clear that more sophisticated modelling of this physics would be required before we can have full confidence in our predicted optima ; they should , nonetheless , provide a useful guide .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we will ignore the effects of confusion due to radio and infra - red ( ir ) point sources , the cmb anisotropies and that due the distribution of clusters themselves which are below the flux limit .",
    "these will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "suffice to say that the limiting flux densities and temperatures that we suggest here are compatible with confusion being negligible except for the most extreme cases .",
    "very much deeper surveys run the risk of becoming confusion limited .",
    "we note that some of our conclusions concerning the most advantageous instrumental setup do not take into account possible strategies to mitigate problems which might occur due to confusion backgrounds .",
    "we should note that our optimization are only of relevance to ground - based experiments specifically designed to perform high resolution cmb measurements and sz surveys at a single frequency . for general purpose , multi - frequency instruments such as planck ,",
    "the observational strategy ( in the case of planck , an all sky survey ) has been designed to take into account a wide range of possible applications , not just the ability to detect the sz in clusters .    throughout this paper",
    "we will work in natural units where @xmath18 .",
    "standard conversion factors can be found , for example , in kolb & turner ( 1989 ) .",
    "except in section  [ robust ] where we test the robustness of our predictions , we will use a fiducial cosmological model which is a flat @xmath19cdm model with @xmath20 .",
    "this model is compatible with recent cmb  @xcite , large - scale structure ( lss )  @xcite , hubble constant  @xcite and weak lensing measurements  @xcite .",
    "the precise value of @xmath1 is currently under close scrutiny and is very important in making predictions of cluster observations since the number of objects found is extremely sensitive to its value .",
    "we should note that our chosen value is larger than some other values quoted in the literature  @xcite and we will return to this issue in section  [ robust ] .",
    "where necessary we use a baryon density which satisfies current estimates  @xcite and a spectral index of initial density fluctuations @xmath21 . only very extreme changes from these two parameters",
    "can lead to significantly different results .",
    "we will use the mass function deduced from the suite of n - body simulations  @xcite performed by the virgo collaboration .",
    "the comoving number density of objects at redshift @xmath22 in the mass range @xmath23 to @xmath24 is given by ( z , m)=-0.22_m(t_0)m_md_mdm\\{-|a(z , m)|^3.86 } , where @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 is the matter density at the present day , @xmath27 is the over density in a virialized region containing mass @xmath23 and @xmath28 is the normalized growth factor which is dependent on cosmological parameters . here",

    "this can be adapted to apply to models where @xmath34  @xcite .",

    "we will use @xmath39 as the normalization factor for most of our discussion , but will consider the effects of other values of @xmath40 in section  [ robust ] .    the profile of the hot gas @xmath41 , whose mass is related to the total mass of the cluster by @xmath42 , is modelled using the isothermal @xmath43-model  @xcite with @xmath44 as suggested by observations , ( ) = ( 1+^2_c^2)^-1/2 ^ -1 ^ -1 , where @xmath45 is the apparent angular size of the cluster core , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is related to @xmath31 via the angular diameter distance @xmath48 .",
    "we will assume that the gas fraction @xmath49 is universal and redshift independent with value of 0.12  @xcite .",

    "we note that this quantity is not the peak of the sz effect due to the cluster , but the average integrated over a region whose size is set by the instrumental beam size . for the purposes of our discussion we will define a non - standard temperature unit which includes this frequency dependence , allowing us , where desirable , to quote frequency independent limits in the subsequent discussion , t = t^thermg(x)=t_cmbt_e_n_tf_gasm_vir_em_em_pd_a^2i(b,)_b .",

    "our aim is to use relation ( [ smt ] ) to deduce the limiting mass as a function of redshift for a survey with noise quantified by limiting flux density @xmath10 per beam . in order to do this",
    "we first consider the simple case where we do not take into account of any kind of beam smoothing and assume the cluster to be ` detected ' if the flux density in a beam which lies directly over its centre is greater than @xmath10 .",
    "the beam correction @xmath74 is a complicated function of @xmath30 and @xmath22 , but ( [ smt ] ) can be inverted to give @xmath76 as function of @xmath22 using the newton - raphson method .",
    "we have computed this for @xmath77 and the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlim1 ] for a set of surveys which have constant @xmath78 , that is , ones with the same brightness temperature sensitivity .",
    "we see that for large beams , @xmath79 , the shape of the curve reflects the @xmath80 dependence for small @xmath22 of the limiting mass expected in the point source approximation  @xcite . in the absence of beam smoothing , much smaller beams give an altogether different shape since they find it more difficult to detect clusters which are very large , that is , those which are very close by .",
    "this led bartlett ( 2000 ) to suggest that surveys performed with very high resolution instruments should be very deep , contrary to the argument based on euclidean source counts we presented earlier .",
    "however , one must also attempt to take into account the effects of beam smoothing and be careful to make comparisons with configurations of the same temperature sensitivity , as we have done here , rather than flux density sensitivity which is related to the overall collecting area . as we will see this leads to a conclusion somewhere in between these two extremes , strongly dependent on the resolution of the telescope .    in a diffraction limited observation ,",
    "the highest resolution beam size possible is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the diameter of the telescope .",
    "coarser resolution is possible by either physically under - illuminating the dish using appropriate feed horns , or by beam smoothing the resultant map .",
    "let us consider the latter possibility of an increased beam size @xmath83 whose area covers @xmath84 copies of the minimum beam size , that is , @xmath85 .",
    "by adding the noise together for the @xmath84 beams , we see that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the noise temperature corresponding to the minimum beam size , and the noise level in terms of flux density increases to respect ( [ st ] ) .",
    "hence , the limiting flux density becomes @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the flux density limit equivalent to @xmath87 .",
    "this would correspond to taking a map with resolution determined by @xmath90 and convolving it with a gaussian window function with fwhm @xmath91 .    a simple , and unrealistic , assumption is that one can smooth the resulting map to the size of any cluster larger than the minimum beam size which might contribute to it , that is , @xmath84 can take any value @xmath92 adjusted to the size of the cluster in question .",
    "this represents the most one could hope to achieve from a particular observation .",
    "the number of beam areas covered by a cluster weighted by the gas profile function is given by n_b = d()db ( ) . this can be used in conjunction with the newton raphson method to compute the minimum limiting mass .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlim2 ] as well as curves of fixed resolution with @xmath93 , which correspond to @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "we have used @xmath97 , @xmath77 and @xmath98 .",
    "the minimum limiting mass clearly represents the envelope of the family of curves with @xmath84 taking any value between 1 and @xmath99 .",
    "this will be the basis for our idealized total power measurements discussed in section  [ total ]    one might be prevented from using this beam smoothing procedure to detect objects very much larger than the minimum resolution , that is , there exists a maximum beam size @xmath100 above which there should be no beam smoothing .",
    "this might be due , for example , to instrumental baselines .",
    "moreover , in practice the value of @xmath84 will be required to take a discrete set of values ( we note that this may not necessarily correspond to @xmath84 taking integer values ) .",
    "one simple procedure that one might use is to take 4 beam areas from the highest resolution map to form a map with half the resolution ; one which can then be iterated further to give an even lower resolution map . in this case",
    "@xmath95 for some integer @xmath101 .",
    "we investigate the effects of these two more realistic scenarios on the limiting mass in figs .",

    "[ fig : mlim4 ] we only allow @xmath95 , while keeping @xmath102 . we see that if @xmath103 , the limiting mass and , hence , the number of objects found in the survey , is not significantly affected by a finite value of @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the discreteness effects introduced by considering only values of @xmath84 which are multiples of 4 are unlikely to have a particularly strong effect on the number of clusters found in the survey since the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlim4 ] is very close to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlim2 ] .",
    "we will consider , initially , a simple single telescope observation characterized by the system temperature , @xmath104 , the receiver bandwidth , @xmath105 , the number of simultaneous beams , @xmath106 , generated by a focal plane array , and the diameter of the telescope @xmath82 .",
    "the expected @xmath107 instantaneous sensitivity is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the aperture efficiency of the telescope .",
    "in the rest of our discussion we shall use @xmath70 to refer to the minimum beam size @xmath110 .",
    "the question which we would like to answer is how this sensitivity can be deployed most effectively .",
    "the extremes are to point the telescope at the the same piece of sky for the whole period of integration , or to cover the whole sky with a very shallow survey . of course , we are likely to do neither , but the noise temperature per beam of any survey , @xmath111 , and the area covered , @xmath12 , will satisfy @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the integration time and we have assumed a gaussian beam profile .",
    "note that the temperatures , including the system temperatures , quoted here , unless explicitly stated otherwise , are expressed in terms of the sensitivity to the sz effect ( see the earlier discussion of these non - standard temperature units ) .",

    "we see that once this limit on @xmath70 is saturated , the rate of making detection is independent of the overall collecting area , in contrast to the case for point sources .",
    "we also see that the survey goes from being flux density limited to surface brightness temperature limited at this saturation point .",
    "given that currently available receivers have values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 which are close physical limits , one sees that the only way to improve the detection rate is by increasing @xmath106 .",
    "we note that the largest value of @xmath106 is limited by the size of the focal plane of the telescope .    an important consequence of an sz survey being surface brightness temperature limited is that , for fixed values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the optimal frequency to observe at would be the lowest possible , that is , @xmath120 , where the sz effect is strongest in terms of brightness temperature .",
    "in reality , the best available values for @xmath104 and @xmath105 also are dependent on @xmath61 ( typically the best available instantaneous sensitivity , @xmath121 , is a very weak function of frequency ) , and this is also mitigated by , both , the fact that point source confusion is greatest at the lowest frequency , and probably more significantly , that achieving the saturation resolution requires a larger diameter telescope for lower frequencies .",
