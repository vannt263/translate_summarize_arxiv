    "flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) are radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with broad emission lines and a non - thermal spectrum extending from radio to gamma ray energies .",

    "similar properties are also observed in bl lacs and these two types of agn are classified as blazars . according to agn unification scheme , blazars are the class of agn with a relativistic jet pointed close to the line of sight of the observer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of fsrq is characterized by two broad humps .",
    "the low energy hump in the sed is well understood as synchrotron emission from a relativistic distribution of electrons . whereas , the origin of high energy hump is still matter of debate .",
    "there are several models to explain the high energy emission based on either leptonic or hadronic interactions ( @xcite ) . under the assumption of leptonic models ,",
    "high energy emission is explained via inverse compton scattering of soft target photons .",
    "the target photons can be the synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) ) ( @xcite ) or the photons external to the jet ( external compton ( ec))(@xcite ) .",
    "these external photons can be the accretion disk photons ( @xcite ) or the accretion disk photons reprocessed by broad line region ( blr ) clouds ( @xcite ) or the infrared radiation from the dusty torus ( @xcite ) .",
    "hadronic models explain the high energy emission as an outcome of the synchrotron proton emission and proton - photon interactions with the synchrotron photons ( synchrotron proton blazar model ) ( @xcite ) .",

    "the flux of 3c279 is also known to be strongly variable at radio , infrared , optical , uv , x - ray and gamma - ray energies ( @xcite and references therein ) . during 2006 , 3c279 undergone a dramatic flare and was observed by webt ( whole earth blazar telescope ) campaign ( @xcite ) at radio , near infrared and optical frequencies and simultaneously monitored by _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ at x - ray energies ( @xcite ) and by _ magic _ telescope at vhe gamma rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sed of 3c279 is modelled as synchrotron and inverse compton emission using these simultaneous observations at various energies .",
    "the explanation of the compton hump as an outcome of ssc process due to the cooling of a relativistic power - law electron distribution is not very successful ( @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation had a serious drawbacks in explaining the high energy gamma ray ( @xmath1 ) detection from 3c279 since it require very high radiation energy density compared to magnetic energy density(@xcite ) .",
    "it also require unusually low magnetic field to explain the vhe emission(@xcite ) . however in case of bl lac objects , the models considering the ssc process are able to reproduce gamma ray emission successfully ( @xcite ) .",
    "other alternative explanation for the compton hump of 3c279 is the ec mechanism with the target photons external to the jet .",

    "@xcite studied the @xmath94 absorption of vhe gamma rays from 3c279 and suggested the emission region must be located within the blr region .",

    "@xcite suggested a multi - zone leptonic model as a possibility to explain the vhe emission from 3c279 since one zone model require low magnetic fields and/or very high lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "however they arrived to this conclusion by considering the blr photons as the target photons for the external compton process instead of infrared photons from the dusty torus .",
    "@xcite considered a model which is similar to the one described in the present work , but their aim was to project the importance of the comptonisation of infrared photons from the torus to reproduce the high energy spectrum . in the present work ,",
    "we have used simultaneous observation of 3c279 at different energies to deduce the physical parameters of the source .",
    "we reproduce the observed simultaneous broadband spectrum of 3c279 using a simple one zone leptonic model considering synchrotron , ssc and ec processes . from the radio / optical synchrotron spectrum",
    "we show that the vhe emission can not be attributed to ssc process whereas ec scattering of ir photons from the dusty torus can explain the observed vhe emission . interpreting the x - ray emission as continuation of ec",
    "spectrum require magnetic field much lower than its equipartition value .",
    "however an explanation based on ssc origin of x - ray require a magnetic field which is comparable to the equipartition value .",
    "the model predicts large flux at mev - gev energies .",
    "since the data in these energy range is not available during the considered flare , such a prediction can not be ruled out .",
    "the model parameters describing the source are estimated by considering a magnetic field which is in equipartition with the particle energy density .",
    "a deviation from this condition will reflect in the value of the estimated parameters .",
    "also if the jet matter contains considerable amount of energetic protons , then the contribution from these protons should be included in equipartition magnetic field .",
    "however in the present work , the proton contribution to the total particle energy is considered to be negligible .",
    "also the size of the emission region estimated from equation([eq : size ] ) is only an upper limit and the actual size may be smaller .",
    "moreover in reality the size of the emission region may be different for different energy bands .",

    "<S> we model the simultaneous observations of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3c279 at radio , optical , x - ray and very high energy ( vhe ) gamma ray energies during 2006 flare using a simple one zone leptonic model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider synchrotron emission due to cooling of a non - thermal electron distribution in an equipartition magnetic field and inverse compton emission due to the scattering off synchrotron photons ( ssc ) and external soft photons ( ec ) by the same distribution of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the vhe gamma ray flux can not be explained by ssc process thereby suggesting the ec mechanism as a plausible emission process at this energy </S>",
    "<S> . the ec scattering of blr photons to vhe energies will be in klein - nishina regime predicting a steep spectrum which is contrary to the observations . </S>",
    "<S> however the infrared photons from the dusty torus can be boosted to vhe energies with the scattering process remaining in the thomson regime . </S>",
    "<S> though ec process can successfully explain the observed vhe flux , it require a magnetic field much lower than the equipartition value to reproduce the observed x - ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> hence we attribute the x - ray emission due to ssc process . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the physical parameters of 3c279 considering the above mentioned emission processes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we assume the size of emission region constrained by a variability timescale of one day . </S>",
