    "since the discovery of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) by binnig and rohrer @xcite , highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) has been one of the most commonly used model surfaces for investigating and modeling of the stm imaging process .",
    "hopg has a hexagonal structure with weakly coupled layers of graphene stacked in abab ... sequence .",
    "graphene is a semi - metal with zero density of states ( dos ) at @xmath0 but a weak inter - layer interaction in graphite makes this dos finite but small .",
    "this small dos is quite sensitive to defects that influence the overlap of orbitals between layers @xcite .",
    "this makes such defects easily visible by stm .",
    "further , the weak inter - layer interaction makes such defects , like moir patterns , possible near the surface of hopg .",
    "a widespread study of this material has led to the discovery of several types of crystal imperfections native to the basal plane of hopg .",
    "these include stacking faults , graphite strands and fibers , broken or flaked layers @xcite , super - lattices @xcite with periodicity of about ten nanometers or even larger , and the buckling of the top layer @xcite .    broadly speaking",
    ", super - lattice structures in hopg can occur due to three reasons .",
    "first type appears in graphite - intercalated compounds @xcite with fixed period super - lattices like , @xmath1 or 2@xmath22 .",
    "second type is the electron density oscillations ( like friedal oscillations ) near point defects with a periodicity @xmath3 times that of graphite @xcite .",
    "these oscillations decay rapidly as one moves away from the defect .",
    "the third one involves disorientation of one or more of the graphite layers near the surface @xcite .",
    "this type of super - lattice structure is commonly known as moir pattern and it arises as an interference pattern of two identical but slightly rotated periodic lattices .",
    "as first suggested by kuwabara et .",
    "@xcite , this rotation by a small angle @xmath4 gives rise to a super - lattice of the same symmetry but with much larger lattice constant given by , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 as the lattice constant of the original lattice .",
    "this super - lattice is rotated with respect to the original lattice by an angle @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we present stm study of a spatially varying 2-d super - lattice pattern and 1-d fringes observed on hopg ( 0001 ) surface near some defects .",
    "such 2-d patterns have been reported earlier by several groups and are widely believed to be due to the moir interference @xcite .",
    "spatially varying periodicity patterns have also been reported before and have been attributed to a shear strain @xcite or quantum confinement in a linear potential @xcite .",
    "the pattern observed here seems to be a result of an in - plane shear strain causing a spatially varying moir rotation of a top layer .",
    "however , this is the first observation of linear fringes connected with a moir pattern .",
    "we also discuss how these fringes can arise from a shear strain using a simple theory similar to the one proposed by amidror and hersch @xcite for moir patterns in optics .",
    "this approach gives us a better analytical insight into the large scale structure of such patterns .",
    "an earlier model on moir patterns in graphite is purely computational , based on the variation in local density of atoms @xcite . in our model , the moir patterns are examined in fourier transformed k - space to quantify the variation in local stacking for a fixed as well as a spatially varying moir rotation angle .",
    "using this idea we can understand and simulate the above observed pattern and , in particular , the 1-d fringes .",
    "experiments were done with a home built stm similar to the one described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this stm uses a commercial electronics and software @xcite .",
    "the data reported here were taken in ambient conditions .",
    "hopg was fixed on the sample holder with a conducting epoxy and the sample was freshly cleaved using an adhesive tape before mounting it on the stm .",
    "fresh cut pt@xmath8ir@xmath9 wire of 0.25 mm diameter was used as the stm tip .",
    "the images have been obtained in constant current ( feedback on ) mode .",
    "the images shown here are filtered to remove steps and spikes , however , for quantitative analysis we have used the unfiltered data .",
    "= 2.5 in = 2.5 in    fig.[fig : suplatt]a shows a topographic image of ( 0001 ) basal plane of hopg with the super - lattice structure together with two steps and two carbon fibers .",
    "we mark these as fiber-1 & 2 and step-1 & 2 .",
    "the step-1 is a double layer step with a height of 0.7@xmath100.1 nm while the step-2 is a single layer step .",
    "these step heights have been found from the images taken away from the super - lattice pattern area .",
    "these two steps divide the area into three terraces with the middle one having a super - lattice pattern confined between the two fibers as seen in the same figure .",
    "carbon fibers have been observed earlier by various groups on the graphite surface @xcite .",
    "these , we believe , are long and thin ribbons or rolls of graphite created , presumably , during the cleaving process .",
    "the exact vertical location of the fibers relative to various visible layers is not so clear in this image .",
    "however , since the fibers are strictly limiting the pattern on the mono - layer terrace defined by step-1 and step-2 , we believe that these fibers are in contact with this affected layer . they may be either below or above this particular layer . if a layer is above the fiber it would go over the fiber with some buckling .",
    "such buckling can not be ruled out by stress considerations as the fibers are quite wide ( @xmath1110 nm ) and not so high ( @xmath121 nm ) .",
    "a relatively larger area image including the patterned region is shown in fig.[fig : suplatt]b .",
    "this image was taken later when the fiber-1 was fully relaxed as discussed in detail later .",
    "the region of the left image is marked by a square in the right one .",
    "the other ends of the two fibers are also visible in fig.[fig : suplatt]b . here",
    "we see that the fiber-2 looks brighter above the step-1 and the fiber-1 has similar behavior but this is seen in the fig.[fig : suplatt]a . here , both the fibers look less bright when they emerge from the covered layer(s ) near the center of the image in fig.[fig : suplatt]b .    as shown in fig.[fig : suplatt]a the super - lattice contains two regions namely a 2-d lattice extending till the end of fiber-1 and a 1-d wave - like pattern starting from the fiber-1 end .",
    "the 1-d fringes bend towards the step-2 and terminate at this step .",
    "the 2-d lattice continues beyond the fiber-2 end but terminates at step-2 in this image .",
    "the 1-d pattern contains the same number of maxima and minima as the terminating 2-d lattice .",
    "the 2-d lattice is not uniform as it evolves from a hexagonal lattice deep inside the fibers to nearly a square lattice with much larger periodicity .",
    "the super - lattice structure is also present over the step-1 ( up to fiber-1 ) but with corrugation reduced by a factor of 2.3 .",
    "although this is not clearly visible in fig.[fig : suplatt ] but we clearly see it on zooming into this area .",
    "the corrugation is also found to vary with periodicity as analyzed later .",
    "= 1.8 in = 1.8 in = 1.8 in    as we image this area repeatedly , fiber-1 becomes shorter in length as the whole fiber seems to recede .",
    "this may be due to some stress on the fiber .",
    "several groups have reported various surface modifications in the stm experiments but the exact mechanism behind such modifications is not quite understood .",
    "we show three of the latter images in fig.[fig : etching ] depicting the changing pattern with the fiber-1 withdrawal .",
    "the withdrawal of this fiber is not uniform with time as sometimes a significant length disappears in one scan and at other times it recedes gradually .",
    "eventually the receding stopped and the length of the fiber stayed same over a couple of days .",
    "one remarkable observation is the pinning of the boundary between the 2-d super - lattice and the 1-d fringes to the fiber-1 end . with the receding of fiber-1",
    ", the 1-d fringes terminate on the fiber-2 as opposed to step-2 in earlier images .",
    "moreover , the spatial extent and corrugation amplitude of 1-d fringes increases together with some modifications in the large scale structure of the 1-d pattern .",
    "two close - up images of this pattern are shown in fig.[fig : fft ] in two different regions of the structure at different orientation of the image window as compared to the previous ones .",
    "these images have been taken at an early stage when fiber-1 was extending the most . as apparent from the image shown in fig.[fig : fft]a , the pattern deep inside the fibers ( towards left ) is a hexagonal lattice of fixed periodicity .",
    "as we move out , the periodicity increases with the pattern evolving to an oblique lattice and then to nearly a square lattice as seen in fig.[fig : fft]b .",
    "fourier transforms ( ft ) of these images as shown in the inset also illustrate this variation .",
    "in detail , the ft in fig.[fig : fft]a shows six sharp spots while the ft in fig.[fig : fft]b has these spots elongated .",
    "= 1.8 in = 1.8 in    = 1.8 in = 1.7 in    to analyze the periodicity variation carefully , line cuts were taken along various lines perpendicular to the line ` c ' in fig.[fig : fft]b .",
    "two such representative lines are a and b along which the topographic height is plotted in fig.[fig : fft]c and fig.[fig : fft]d .",
    "these lines were carefully chosen to pass over the bright spots of the 2-d lattice .",
    "the periodicity along the lines perpendicular to c was found to be visibly constant but as one moves out along c this periodicity increases .",
    "the corrugation along the line c also varies .",
    "the rms corrugation and periodicity as measured by line cuts perpendicular to c are plotted in fig.[fig : fft]e and fig.[fig : fft]f as a function of distance along the line c. the periodicity along such lines has been found from the average separation between peaks .",
    "if we use the moir rotation hypothesis , the rotation angle @xmath4 ( between the top layer and the layers underneath ) should also change spatially to get a varying lattice spacing d. using @xmath5 ( d=0.246 nm ) , we plot the variation of @xmath4 in fig.[fig : fft]g .",
    "this varying @xmath4 implies that this rotated layer undergoes a shear as we move out of the fibers .",
    "the portion of this layer that is well inside the fibers has a constant rotation and the portion far outside the fibers is free of any moir pattern and thus @xmath4 is zero .",
    "the intermediate region is strained with a changing @xmath4 and periodicity . as estimated from the periodicity , the angle @xmath4 changes from @xmath13 to @xmath14 . the 1-d fringe pattern which has a close correlation with the 2-d moir pattern",
    "prompts us towards a common origin for the two patterns .",
    "we believe that @xmath4 s particular spatial dependence is responsible for the 1-d fringes as discussed later .",
    "a second order polynomial fit ( as shown in fig.[fig : fft]g ) for this @xmath4 variation gives an expression , @xmath15 with @xmath16degree , @xmath17degree / nm , @xmath18degree / nm@xmath19 .",
    "this is also the expression for local angular orientation for a cantilever with one end clamped and the other end loaded @xcite .",
    "a possibility on how the stress arises in the graphite layer is similar to the bending of a cantilever with certain loading conditions caused by the fibers . by the definition of strain",
    ", the maximum strain at a given @xmath20 would be @xmath21 . to estimate the maximum strain , the @xmath22 is maximum at the boundary of the 2-d super - lattice and 1-d fringes and it is found from the polynomial fit ( eq.[eq : poly ] ) to be ( 1.6@xmath100.3)@xmath210@xmath23rad / nm . at this location",
    "the thickness ( d ) is 115 nm .",
    "this point gives the largest stress , @xmath24=1.1@xmath100.2 gpa , using @xmath25=121.9 gpa @xcite for graphite .",
    "for comparison , the macroscopic indentation experiments indicate that stress on the order of @xmath261 gpa damages the surface of graphite @xcite . on the other hand , snyder et .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the stress required to induce dislocation motion on basal plane of hopg is of order 5 - 200 mpa .",
    "here we describe a simple model to understand and to simulate the large - scale structure of the spatially varying moir patterns . for illustration ,",
    "let us first consider a 1-d periodic lattice .",
    "if we superimpose two 1-d periodic patterns given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , we would see an interference ( or beats - like ) pattern with periodicity @xmath30 in the superposed pattern ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) . in 2-d",
    "if we superimpose two hexagonal patterns of slightly different reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( i = 1 - 6 ) , the resulting pattern in real space would come from the difference of the two sets of lattice vectors , i.e. , ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the longest period variations would arise from @xmath35 ( see fig.[fig : moire ] ) , which are actually responsible for the moir patterns here . in 2-d",
    ", the pattern could arise due to differences in both the magnitude and direction of @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite but in the present case only the direction mismatch is playing the major role .",
    "= 1.5 in = 1.5 in    @xmath38 as seen from fig.[fig : moire ] , has a magnitude of @xmath39 and the smallest angle it makes with one of the @xmath40 s is 30@xmath41/2 .",
    "this is consistent with the aforementioned periodicity and angle of the moir super - lattice .",
    "now the moir interference pattern in real space is easily produced by inverse fourier transformation ( ift ) of these six @xmath42 vectors .",
    "this ift gives a pattern described by , @xmath43 , \\label{eq : moire - fft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two constants and @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{eq : moire - f - def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here n=1 , 2 or 3 and @xmath47 with @xmath6 ( = 0.246 nm ) as the real space ab - plane lattice parameter of graphite .",
    "each cosine term in eq.[eq : moire - fft ] gives rise to a 1-d periodic pattern with bright and dark fringes along parallel straight lines ( for constant @xmath4 ) .",
    "the bright fringes of @xmath48 are described by the contours @xmath49 , with n as an integer . for a constant @xmath4",
    ", the fringes due to the three cosine terms make an angle @xmath50 with each other and the sum of these three cosines leads to a 2-d triangular lattice pattern .",
    "one such pattern is shown in fig.[fig : moire]b for @xmath51 , @xmath44=0 , and @xmath45=1 . in this model",
    ", the @xmath52 only quantifies the local stacking pattern .",
    "the @xmath52 has a variation between + 3 and -3 ( taking @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) with a value of + 3 signifying an aa stacking and -3 signifying an ab stacking .",
    "an intermediate value represents a slip with the degree of slip quantified by the magnitude of @xmath52 .",
    "the dos at the surface is a result of top three layers and so the dos at bab and bac could be actually different while our model does not differentiate between these two stacking sequences @xcite .",
    "this model can also be used for the geometrically transformed lattices @xcite , where the rotation angle is spatially varying . this way we can model the spatially varying moir patterns and understand their large scale structure . in particular",
    ", we can find an analytical condition on the spatial variation of the rotation angle that gives rise to the 1-d fringes as following . for spatially varying @xmath4 , the 1-d fringes due to each @xmath48 will have a spatially varying periodicity and , in general , these fringes may not be straight and parallel to each other",
    ". these fringes will be locally perpendicular to @xmath55 and their local periodicity can be quantified by @xmath56 .",
    "these @xmath57 s ( see eq.[eq : moire - f - def ] ) satisfy the condition , @xmath58 for @xmath52 to have a 1-d pattern , the fringes due to the contributing cosine terms must be locally parallel to each other or , in other words , each @xmath57 should have the same constant value contours .",
    "in particular , and as it turns out to be the case for the observed 1-d fringes , if the @xmath4 variation is such that @xmath59 ( a constant ) then using eq.[eq : grad - f ] , @xmath60 . for such @xmath4 variations @xmath61 gives no fringes while the fringes due to @xmath62 and @xmath63 are locally parallel with the same local wavelength .",
    "thus @xmath52 would have only 1-d fringes .",
    "similar argument would also hold for @xmath64=constant or @xmath65=constant , which is obvious from symmetry considerations .",
    "the expression for @xmath66 ( eq.[eq : moire - f - def ] ) can be simplified to , @xmath67 and so for @xmath68 we find , @xmath69-tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : theta - lin - fr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in small @xmath4 approximation we can neglect the ( @xmath70 ) term in comparison to @xmath71 term in eq.[eq : f1-simplified ] and this gives @xmath72 . here , one has to be careful in choosing the origin while using this form of @xmath73 .",
    "the same origin has to be used in calculating the @xmath52 to ensure 1-d fringes .",
    "in fact this choice of origin gives one more parameter in choosing @xmath73 .",
    "a simulated pattern using above ideas is shown in fig.[fig : simul]b together with the observed pattern in fig.[fig : simul]a . here",
    ", we have used two different spatial forms of @xmath4 in different x intervals .",
    "we have used @xmath73 as found in eq.[eq : poly ] for 2-d region , where @xmath4 changes from 2@xmath74 to 1.29@xmath74 .",
    "we use the small @xmath4 approximation for 1-d fringes , i.e. , @xmath75 for @xmath4 between 1.29@xmath74 and 0.76@xmath74 .",
    "the constants @xmath76 and @xmath77 are found to be 3.067 rad - nm and 4.399 nm , respectively , by ensuring the continuity of @xmath4 and @xmath78 at x=132.3 nm .",
    "this is necessary to keep the stress finite and continuous everywhere . for 1-d fringes",
    "the required @xmath73 is of the form of @xmath79 , so in fig.[fig : simul ] , we have actually shown images of @xmath80 with @xmath81 nm .",
    "a plot of the used @xmath4 variation as a function of @xmath20 is shown in fig.[fig : simul]c . since the 2-d to 1-d pattern boundary",
    "is pinned to the fiber-1 end we believe that there is a sudden change in spatial dependence of stress across this @xmath20 causing a change in @xmath4 behavior that in turn is responsible for the boundary .",
    "fig.[fig : simul ] also shows the three @xmath48 maps , where one can see clearly how the pattern arises in the two regions in terms of the three cosines as argued before . in the 1-d fringe region",
    ", we see that @xmath61 gives no fringes while @xmath62 and @xmath63 have fringes that are locally parallel to each other . in the 2-d pattern region",
    "the fringes due to the three cosines are not parallel .",
    "= 1.5 in = 1.5 in = 1.5 in    = 1.5 in = 1.5 in = 1.5 in    so far we discussed a particular condition on @xmath4 that gives 1-d fringes .",
    "now we find a more general condition on @xmath4 for getting 1-d fringes and we also argue here that above used spatial dependence of @xmath4 for 1-d fringes is the only possibility ( in small @xmath4 approximation ) for the observed fringes .",
    "the existence of 1-d fringes requires that all the constant value contours of @xmath66 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are identical .",
    "this is possible if @xmath82 and , using eq.[eq : grad - f ] , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a scalar function . if we assume @xmath84 to be a linear function , i.e. , @xmath85 then @xmath86=@xmath87 .",
    "this , using eq.[eq : moire - f - def ] , gives the same solution for @xmath73 as eq.[eq : theta - lin - fr ] except for @xmath20 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 replaced by @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "in small @xmath4 approximation , this gives @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , any function of the form @xmath94 would give rise to linear fringes for arbitrary @xmath95 ( = @xmath96 ) .",
    "the form of @xmath4 used in producing the linear fringes in fig.[fig : simul ] is a special case with @xmath97=0 and @xmath98 with @xmath87=c . from fig.[fig : simul]a we see that the observed 1-d fringes connect smoothly to the rows of bright spots coming from @xmath62 and @xmath63 while the rows of bright spots due to @xmath61 terminate before the 1-d fringes .",
    "this means that @xmath61 is not contributing to the observed 1-d fringes and @xmath61 has to be constant in this region .",
    "so @xmath99 is the only possibility for the observed fringes in small @xmath4 approximation .",
    "our simulation nicely captures most of the details of the observed pattern except for the curvature of the 1-d fringes . for the curvature in 1-d fringes",
    ", we find that any modification in spatial dependence of @xmath4 from @xmath79 affects the 1-d nature more seriously than producing the curvature .",
    "incidently , using the exact form of @xmath4 as in eq.[eq : theta - lin - fr ] as opposed to its approximate form of @xmath79 does not give the curvature either . here",
    ", we believe that our approach of varying only the directions of @xmath37s and not their magnitude is a bit oversimplified though it captures the general structure of both the 1-d and 2-d patterns .",
    "however , to get both the direction and magnitude of @xmath37s requires a detailed understanding of the strain field in the affected region .",
    "this is not possible from the stm images alone as we have to know the stresses on the boundaries to solve the complete boundary value problem using elasticity theory .",
    "as pointed out earlier , we should be cautious in using this model as this does not describe the quantitative contrast of an stm image . for instance , this model can not explain the variation in corrugation amplitude of the 2-d super - lattice with its periodicity as seen from fig.[fig : fft]e .",
    "the stm contrast here actually represents a dos variation as our local tunneling spectra show that the bright regions are more metallic than the dark ones consistent with earlier work by kuwabara et .",
    "al . @xcite . as of now no calculations on electronic dos on moir patterns in",
    "graphite exist .",
    "a computational model was proposed by hentschke et .",
    "@xcite and reviewed by pong et .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the variation in local density of atoms . in a sense",
    "our @xmath52 also quantifies the local density of atoms but our model is more appropriate for the analytical understanding of the large scale structure of the spatially varying moir patterns .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a spatially varying 2-d and a connected 1-d super - lattice structure on hopg .",
    "this is the first observation of such 1-d fringes connected to a 2-d moir lattice and we attribute this pattern to a spatially varying moir rotation of a top graphite layer .",
    "the spatially varying rotation implies a shear strain in this layer . we have also described a simple model for understanding spatially varying moire patterns .",
    "this model can successfully simulate the observed pattern by using a spatially varying rotation angle .",
    "the 1-d fringes are found to arise from a particular spatial dependence of the moire rotation angle .",

    "<S> we report on the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) observation of linear fringes together with spatially varying super - lattice structures on ( 0001 ) graphite ( hopg ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> the structure , present in a region of a layer bounded by two straight carbon fibers , varies from a hexagonal lattice of 6 nm periodicity to nearly a square lattice of 13 nm periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> it then changes into a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) fringe - like pattern before relaxing into a pattern - free region . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this surface structure to a shear strain giving rise to a spatially varying rotation of the affected graphite layer relative to the bulk substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple method to understand these moir patterns by looking at the fixed and rotated lattices in the fourier transformed k - space . using this approach </S>",
    "<S> we can reproduce the spatially varying 2-d lattice as well as the 1-d fringes by simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-d fringes are found to result from a particular spatial dependence of the rotation angle . </S>"
