    "first row ( @xmath11 ) transition metal ions in high oxidation states have been of interest for some time , due to their competing and delicate spin states .",
    "there are still several cases where behavior is not understood , indeed sometimes ( due to sample questions arising from difficulty in synthesis ) the data is not unambiguous . the best known , and most thoroughly studied , example is that of the quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) cuprates , which when hole - doped become high temperature superconductors . in their undoped state",
    "they are cu@xmath14-based antiferromagnetic insulators .",
    "hole doping drives the cu oxidation state toward the unstable ( practically non - existent ) cu@xmath15 state . at a doping level of 0.15 - 0.20 holes / cu",
    "optimal superconductivity is reached .",
    "they can be doped beyond that level , when they become conventional metallic fermi liquids . upon",
    "hole doping the ` oxidation state ' designation must be interpreted with care , since it is clear that the holes go onto the oxygen ions to a large degree .",
    "another high - oxidation - state ion is co@xmath2 .",
    "this ion has recently gained wide exposure due to the unusual properties of na@xmath16coo@xmath0 , including the discovery@xcite that this system becomes superconducting ( 4.5 k ) around @xmath17=0.3 when it is hydrated .",
    "this value of @xmath17 suggests that the co ion is 70% of the way to being co@xmath2 , or alternatively , 70% of the ions are co@xmath2 while 30% are co@xmath15 .",
    "this system is however metallic for all @xmath17 except for na ion / orbital / spin / charge ordering@xcite precisely at @xmath17=0.5 ( precisely what is responsible is not yet clear ) .",
    "there is magnetism and correlated electron behavior for @xmath18 ( the co@xmath15 end ) while for @xmath19 the materials appear to be weakly correlated nonmagnetic metals .",
    "while there has been much expectation that the ( metastable ) endpoint member coo@xmath0 ( nominally co@xmath20 ) is a mott insulator , the evidence is that it remains a nonmagnetic metal.@xcite calculations indicate@xcite that , as in the cuprates , upon hole doping from the co@xmath15 end , much of the charge difference occurs on the o ion .",
    "the la@xmath21sr@xmath16coo@xmath1 system ( lscoo ) with two - dimensional layered k@xmath0nif@xmath1 structure has become interesting because of its magnetic and electrical properties . in this system",
    "the formal oxidation state co@xmath22 near the la end is not unusually high , so its behavior might be expected to be readily understandable . with increasing sr concentration @xmath17 , lscoo shows a structural transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal ( i.e. , a lattice constant @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 ) around @xmath17=0.5 , with enhanced two - dimensional electronic properties.@xcite the structural transition may be connected to an antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic transition ( the maximum curie temperature @xmath26=220 k at @xmath17=0.9),@xcite accompanying a magnetic change that has been interpreted in terms of a co@xmath15 spin - state transition from high spin to intermediate spin configurations around @xmath17=0.7.@xcite there is another suggestion that at @xmath17=1 the system is a high - spin , low - spin charge - ordered state.@xcite however , there is no agreement amongst the measurements on the magnetic behavior @xcite nor metallic behavior@xcite .",
    "the end member @xmath17=0 is an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator with neel temperature @xmath27=275 k.@xcite    although earlier studies were confined to the range below @xmath17=1.4 , recently the end member sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 , formally co@xmath2 , was synthesized by matsuno _",
    "et al._@xcite and by wang _",
    "et al._@xcite , and characterized as fm with high curie temperature @xmath26@xmath28250 k. however , their differing synthetic methods have led to different properties .",
    "_ synthesized a single - crystalline thin film using pulsed - laser deposition , while wang _",
    "_ produced polycrystalline samples under high pressure , high temperature conditions .",
    "the former shows metallic @xmath29-dependent resistivity below @xmath26 , although it has definitely higher resistivity of order of 10@xmath30 @xmath31 cm at low @xmath29 than in a typical metal .",
    "the pressure - synthesized samples show nearly temperature independent resistivity ( perhaps due to polycrystallinity ) , but with similar magnitude .",
    "the more confusing difference is in the observed saturation magnetic moment , 1.8 @xmath4 and 1 @xmath4/co respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the sample with the smaller ordered moment has been observed@xcite effective ( curie - weiss ) moment @xmath32= 3.72 @xmath4 , characteristic of a much higher @xmath33 spin configuration .",
    "such a moment would suggest a much higher ordered moment , @xmath34 .    the related perovskite system la@xmath35sr@xmath16coo@xmath36 ( formally co@xmath37 ) has been studied for some time.@xcite its magnetic properties",
    "are also altered by sr concentration @xmath17 : nonmagnetic for @xmath38 0.05 , spin glass for 0.05 @xmath39 0.2 , and ferromagnetic above @xmath17=0.2 . for the end member , srcoo@xmath36 ( `` co@xmath2 '' )",
    "shows metallic conductivity and has magnetic moments 1.25 and 0.1 @xmath4 for co and o respectively,@xcite whereas the ground state of lacoo@xmath36 is a nonmagnetic band insulator .",
    "its excitations have been interpreted in terms of a locally orbitally - ordered excited state.@xcite    in this paper , we look in some detail at the electronic and magnetic structure of sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 both as uncorrelated , using the local density approximation ( lda ) , and viewing effects of correlation as described by the lda+hubbard @xmath7 ( lda+u ) method .",
    "both commonly used lda+u functionals are employed , and their results are compared and contrasted . a number of unusually rich magnetic phenomena arise ( including a half metallic phase ) , reflecting the strong hybridization with o @xmath5 states that complicates the accommodation of correlation effects on the co ion .",
    "sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 has the bct k@xmath0nif@xmath1-type structure , space group @xmath40 ( no .",
    "139 ) , pictured in fig .",
    "the co - planar o ( po ) bond length ( 1.878   ) is shorter by about 6% than that of co - apical o ( ao ) ( 1.988   ) .",
    "the distorted coo@xmath41 octahedron , elongated along @xmath42-axis , leads to crystal field splitting of @xmath43 e@xmath44(@xmath45 ) + b@xmath46(@xmath47 ) and @xmath48 a@xmath44(@xmath49 ) + b@xmath50(@xmath51 ) states .",

    "et al_.@xcite    our calculations were carried out within the local density approximation ( lda ) and lda+u approaches with the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital ( fplo ) method.@xcite both commonly used schemes of the lda+u method were employed so comparisons of the predictions could be made .",
    "both forms have the same hubbard - like density - density interaction @xmath52 n_{m\\sigma } n_{m'\\sigma ' } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a site occupation set and @xmath54 is intra exchange integral .",
    "the form displayed here is schematic in the sense that it does not display all of the indices involved in the full coordinate - system - independent form that is implemented in the code .",
    "the two lda+u approaches differ only in the method of treatment of the ",
    "double counting \" term , intended to subtract out the shell - averaged interaction that has already been included in lda .",

    "these double - counting terms can be written in other forms that emphasize other aspects of the interaction.@xcite however , this form is illustrative because it emphasizes that the difference lies in the magnitude of the ( self - consistent ) atomic moment .",
    "clearly it is only the spherically averaged values of @xmath7 and @xmath54 that enter the double - counting terms .",
    "the difference between the two forms is that the double - counting term , and the resulting potential , includes a spin dependence in the fll form .",
    "the fully relativistic scheme of fplo@xcite was used when spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in lda was necessary .",
    "the choice of basis orbitals were sr @xmath58 , co @xmath59 , and o @xmath60 .",
    "( the orbitals in parentheses indicate semi - core or polarization orbitals . )",
    "the brillouin zone was sampled by a regular mesh containing up to 641 irreducible * k * points for lda and lda+u , and 1639 irreducible * k * points for soc and fixed spin moment ( fsm)@xcite calculations that require more carefully treatment near the fermi level ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the fm lda band structures , exhibiting total magnetic moment @xmath6=1.95 @xmath4 that is only accidentally near an integer value , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fmband ] .",
    "the five co @xmath11 bands and three @xmath5 bands of each o constitute an entanglement of 17 hybridized bands for each spin , with total @xmath62 bandwidths of 10 ev and 11 ev for the majority and minority bands respectively .",
    "the strong hybridization throughout the bands is evident in the corresponding total dos and accompanying atom - projected dos , shown in fig .",
    "the crystal field splitting of 2 ev , identified from the density of states , between @xmath63 and @xmath64 manifolds is only a little higher than the exchange splitting 1.3 ev .",
    "as noted earlier , these @xmath63 and @xmath64 designations are broken down by the @xmath65 symmetry of the co site .",
    "the electronic structure shows clear quasi - two - dimensionality , consistent with resistivity measurement by matsuno _",
    "et al . _    in fig .",
    "[ fmband ] , the @xmath66 and @xmath67 bands ( for each of @xmath51 and @xmath49 orbitals ) are highlighted .",
    "the more dispersive bands ( darker , or red ) arise from bonding and antibonding interactions between co @xmath51 and po @xmath68 states . the bonding and antibonding bands have a separation of 10 ev at the @xmath69 point , this total width arising from a combination of the differences between the @xmath63 and @xmath5 site energies , and the hybridization between them .",
    "the dispersion of the antibonding ( upper ) band can be described roughly by effective hopping amplitude @xmath70 = 0.40 ev ( majority ) and @xmath70 = 0.53 ev ( minority ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath51 band is similar to that observed in the high @xmath71 superconductor la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , in which this antibonding band plays a central role,@xcite but it is mostly unoccupied here .",
    "however , with the lower number of @xmath11 electrons the cobaltate electronic structure is influenced more strongly by the @xmath63 manifold , which forms relatively flat bands , the top of which hovers around the fermi energy . in the minority bands a van hove singularity lies at @xmath61 at the @xmath72 point , perhaps contributing to the positioning of the fermi level and hence to the total moment .",
    "the less dispersive highlighted bands ( green , or lighter ) , lying in the 0 - 2 ev range , arise from the antibonding interaction of co @xmath49 and ao @xmath68 states .",
    "the bonding band of this pair consists of a remarkably flat band at -4 ev for each spin direction .",
    ".co @xmath11 orbital ( mullikan ) occupancy in lda , where @xmath6=1.95 @xmath4 .",
    "the difference of occupancies between both spin channels is directly related with contribution of each orbital to spin magnetic moment , which can be seen to be spread over all five @xmath11 orbitals . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]      since the appropriate value of @xmath7 in this and other cobaltate systems is unclear , we have studied the ground state as @xmath7 is increased .",
    "the moment initially increases slightly in fll , while it decreases slowly to 1.5 @xmath4 at @xmath7=2.5 ev in amf , as shown in fig .",
    "[ um ] . from their separate states just below and at the critical value @xmath73=2.5 ev , beyond this critical value the moment drops sharply to 1 @xmath4 in both schemes , and",
    "then both schemes produce very similar results in the entire region above @xmath73 .",
    "note particularly that this transition starts from distinct states , but occurs at the same value @xmath8 to the same final state . both high - moment and low - moment states can be stabilized in the calculations at @xmath73 . unlike studies in the na@xmath16coo@xmath0 system , no discernible hysteretic region could be found at this first - order transition .",
    "this magnetic collapse accompanies a metal to half metal transition , presumably because there is a particular stability of this half metallic ( hm ) fm state since both lda+u schemes transition to it .",
    "the hm state , with a magnetic moment 1 @xmath4 , has been observed also by wang _",
    "_ as @xmath7 increases , the co local magnetic moment decreases to vanishingly small value by @xmath746 - 7 ev .",
    "the state remains a hm fm , the moment has been pushed onto the po ions . since the moment on co has vanished , it is not surprising that the two lda+u schemes give the same result .    the microscopic mechanism behind the magnetic collapse induced by the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath7 can be unraveled from a study of the charge decompositions in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , and comparison of band structures .",
    "we can compare and contrast the two viewpoints .",
    "first we point out that , while the mullikan charges given in these tables are somewhat basis set dependent so their specific magnitude should not be given undue significance , differences  whether between orbitals or between spin - projections  are more physical . then , while these orbital occupations provide one characterization , we have also provided in figs .",
    "[ fmband ] and [ fmuband ] by the fatbands technique , the bands that one identifies with @xmath51 and @xmath49 character . using both viewpoints",
    "provides a more robust interpretation of behavior than either separately .    from the tables",
    "one can determine that increasing @xmath7 does not change the total @xmath11 occupation , but introduces rearrangements in the @xmath11 charge and moment .",
    "from the bands , the main difference ( between fm lda and hm fm lda+u ) is that the dispersive majority @xmath51 band has become fully _",
    "un_occupied , leaving the small gap that results in half metallicity . returning to the charges and moments , what stands out is that the moment on the @xmath51 orbital has flipped , from + 0.35@xmath4 to -0.43@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath49 moment has undergone a smaller change in the same manner : 0.20@xmath4 to -0.09@xmath4 .",
    "thus the net moment on the co ion , which is @xmath75 , is the result of @xmath76 in the @xmath63 orbitals ( primarily @xmath47 ) and @xmath77 in the @xmath64 orbitals .",
    "this type of cancellation , in more striking form , has been seen previously in lda+u results for lanio@xmath0,@xcite which has an unusually _ low _ formal oxidation state for a nickelate .",
    "the results of the previous section show that two magnetic states coexist at @xmath73 in lda+u , whether one uses the amf or fll functional .",
    "such a coexistence has been already observed in lda+u calculations for the sodium cobaltates , where the change at @xmath73 corresponds to a charge disproportionation transition.@xcite here the change is simply in the state of the ( single ) co ion ; there is no experimental indication of disproportionation here . here",
    "we analyze the fsm results at @xmath73 for lda , amf , and fll .    the energy versus total magnetic moment behavior , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fsm ] , shows very interesting differences as well as similarities .",
    "perhaps most interesting is that positions of local minima occur at ( or near ) integer values m=0 , 1 , and 2 ( in units of @xmath4 ) , as if there might be underlying states with @xmath78 = 0 , @xmath79 , or 1 pervading the behavior .",
    "the results of previous sections however established that there is strong @xmath80 hybridization which renders integral moments no more favored than other values .",
    "the lda curve shows simple behavior : a stoner instability at m=0 and a single minimum near ( but not precisely at ) m=2 .",
    "the lda+u results show more interesting variation .",
    "for both amf and fll the paramagnetic state is metastable , with energy rising up to a moment @xmath81 , and then decreasing very similarly to the minimum at @xmath6=1 . beyond that point ,",
    "amf levels off to a broad flat region @xmath6=1.31.8 beyond which it increases with @xmath6 .",
    "fll however switches over to a separate phase , with its minimum at @xmath6=2 .",
    "the e(@xmath6 ) curve for fll seems to consist of two separate parabolas ( different phases ) with minima very near @xmath6=1 and @xmath6=2 .",
    "the m=1 result is integral because a half metallic phase is encountered ( see fig .",
    "[ fmuband ] ) and not due to an @xmath82 configuration of the co ion . both majority @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath49 become completely unoccupied , leaving a small gap to the @xmath63 bands .",
    "we must point out that for both amf and fll schemes , the minimum at @xmath6=0 @xmath4 does not correspond to a nonmagnetic state .",
    "there is a moment on co with magnitude 0.14 @xmath4 that is canceled by magnetization on the po ion .",
    "the driving force for favoring this low , canceling moment phase over a nonmagnetic state is not clear .",
    "possibly an antiferromagnetic result , requiring a doubled unit cell , would be a lower energy m=0 solution .      in sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 correlation effects should not be very strong it seems , since lda already gives a fm state that seems consistent with one of the experimental reports .",
    "however , in a strong correlated regime , but not beyond realistic range of @xmath7 , there is another interesting feature .",
    "figure [ occ ] shows the @xmath7-dependent orbital - projected local magnetic moment @xmath83 , defined by the difference between majority and minority occupancies , of co @xmath51 and @xmath47 states . upon increasing @xmath7",
    ", the @xmath47 minority state loses electrons , while the @xmath51 minority state gains electrons .",
    "beyond @xmath84 = 2.5 ev , @xmath47 and @xmath51 have large positive and negative local magnetic moments respectively , leading to an on - site ",
    "singlet \" type cancellation within this @xmath85 channel .",
    "this type of cancellation , but within the @xmath64 manifold , has been seen already in our previous results for lanio@xmath0.@xcite in contrast with lanio@xmath0 , which shows the cancellation in the total magnetic moment and ni@xmath86@xmath24ni@xmath14 conversion , the moment of the system remains unchanged because of large magnetic moments on planar oxygen ions .",
    "synthesis of the high formal oxidation state compound sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 , bulk materials by high - pressure high - temperature techniques and films by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) , have led to a high curie temperature metallic ferromagnet that introduces new transition metal oxide physics and may be useful in spin electronics devices .",
    "we have provided an in - depth study of the electronic and magnetic structure of this compound , looking specifically into the combined effects of correlation on the @xmath11 orbitals and strong hybridization with o @xmath5 states .    within",
    "lda sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 is metallic with a ferromagnetic moment near @xmath87 , close to the saturation magnetization reported for the pld films .",
    "application of the two commonly used lda+u functionals reveals several surprises . as @xmath7",
    "is increased from zero , the two functionals produce changes in the moment of opposite sign up to the critical value @xmath8=2.5 ev . beyond half metallic ferromagnetic phase with moment 1@xmath4 . within this phase",
    ", increasing the value of @xmath7 has the effect of pushing the moment completely off the co and onto the planar o ions by @xmath74 6 - 7 ev , while the total moment remains fixed at 1@xmath4 .    with @xmath7 fixed at @xmath8=2.5 ev , fixed spin moment calculations",
    "were carried out for both lda+u functionals , and compared with the corresponding lda result .",
    "both lda+u schemes behaved similarly out to a minimum at 1@xmath4 ( the half metallic state ) . beyond this",
    "the two functionals departed in their behavior , with the fll scheme jumping to a new state with minimum very near 2@xmath4 , not half metallic and much the same as the lda minimum ( 1.95@xmath4 ) . in the stronger - interacting regime @xmath88 ev ( which may not be appropriate for sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 ) , the correlation described by the lda+u approach leads to oppositely directed moments on the @xmath51 and @xmath47 orbitals , reflecting the strong difference in hybridization of these two orbitals .",
