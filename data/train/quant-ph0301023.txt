    "quantum computation carries the hope of solving in quantum polynomial time classically intractable tasks .",
    "the most notable success so far is shor s quantum algorithm for factoring integers and for finding the discrete log @xcite .",
    "following shor s algorithm , several other algorithms were discovered , such as hallgren s algorithm for solving pell s equation @xcite , watrous s algorithms for the group black box model @xcite , and the legendre symbol algorithm by van dam et al @xcite . except for @xcite ,",
    "all of these algorithms fall into the framework of the hidden subgroup problem , and in fact use exactly the same quantum circuitry ; the exception , @xcite , is a different algorithm but also heavily uses fourier transforms and exploits the special algebraic structure of the problem .",
    "recently , a beautiful new algorithm by childs _ et .",
    "al._@xcite was found , which gives an exponential speed up over classical algorithms using an entirely different approach , namely quantum walks .",
    "the algorithm however , works in the black box model and solves a fairly contrived problem .",
    "one can not overstate the importance of developing qualitatively different quantum algorithmic techniques and approaches for the development of the field of quantum computation . in this paper",
    "we attempt to make a step in that direction by approaching the issue of quantum algorithms from a different point of view .",
    "it has been folklore knowledge for a few years already that the problem of graph isomorphism , which is considered classically hard @xcite has an efficient quantum algorithm as long as a certain state , namely the superposition of all graphs isomorphic to a given graph , @xmath0 suffices is very simple : for two isomorphic graphs , these states are identical , whereas for two non isomorphic graphs they are orthogonal .",
    "a simple circuit can distinguish between the case of orthogonal states and that of identical states , where the main idea is that if the states are orthogonal they will prevent the different states of a qubit attached to them to interfere .",
    "one is tempted to assume that such a state , @xmath1 , is easy to construct since the equivalent classical distribution , namely the uniform distribution over all graphs isomorphic to a certain graph , can be sampled from efficiently .",
    "indeed , the state @xmath2 can be easily generated by this argument ; however , it is a curious ( and disturbing ) fact of quantum mechanics that though @xmath3 is an easy state to generate , so far no one knows how to generate @xmath1 efficiently , because we can not _",
    "forget _ the value of @xmath4",
    ".    in this paper we systematically study the problem of quantum state generation",
    ". we will mostly be interested in a restricted version of state generation , namely generating states corresponding to classical probability distributions , which we loosely refer to as _ quantum sampling _ ( or _ qsampling _ ) from a distribution . to be more specific , we consider _ the probability distribution of a circuit , @xmath5 _ , which is the distribution over the outputs of the classical circuit @xmath6 when its inputs are uniformly distributed .",
    "denote @xmath7 .",
    "we define the problem of circuit quantum sampling :    * circuit quantum sampling ( cqs ) : *    * input : * ( @xmath8 ) where @xmath6 is a description of a classical circuit from @xmath9 to @xmath10 bits , and @xmath11 .",
    "* output : * a description of a quantum circuit @xmath12 of size @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "we first show that most of the quantum algorithmic problems considered so far can be reduced to quantum sampling .",
    "most problems that were considered good candidates for bqp , such as discrete log ( dlog ) , quadratic residuosity , approximating closest and shortest vectors in a lattice , graph isomorphism and more , belong to the complexity class _ statistical zero knowledge _ , or szk ( see section [ szk ] for background . )",
    "we prove    [ thm : szk ] any @xmath15 ( statistical zero knowledge ) can be reduced to a family of instances of cqs .",
    "the proof relies on a reduction by sahai and vadhan @xcite from szk to a complete problem called statistical difference .",
    "theorem [ thm : szk ] shows that a general solution for quantum sampling would imply @xmath16 .",
    "we note that there exists an oracle @xmath17 relative to which @xmath18 @xcite , and so such a proof must be non relativizing .",
    "theorem [ thm : szk ] translates a zero knowledge proof into an instance of cqs . in general",
    ", the reduction can be quite involved , building on the reduction in @xcite .",
    "specific examples of special interest turn out to be simpler , e.g. , for the case of graph isomorphism described above , the reduction results in a circuit @xmath19 that gets as an input a uniformly random string and outputs a uniformly random graph isomorphic to @xmath20 . in section [ szk ]",
    "we demonstrate the reduction for three interesting cases : a decision variant of dlog ( based on a zero knowledge proof of goldreich and kushilevitz @xcite ) , quadratic residuosity ( based on a zero knowledge proof of goldwasser , micali and rackoff @xcite ) and approximating the closest vector problem in lattices ( based on a zero knowledge proof of goldreich and goldwasser @xcite ) .",
    "the special cases reveal that although quite often one can look at the zero knowledge proof and directly infer the required state generation , sometimes it is not obvious such a transition exists at all .",
    "theorem [ thm : szk ] , however , tells us such a reduction is always possible .",
    "the problem of what states can be generated efficiently by a quantum computer is thus of critical importance to the understanding of the computational power of quantum computers .",
    "we therefore embark on the task of designing tools for quantum state generation , and studying which states can be generated efficiently .",
    "the recently suggested framework of adiabatic quantum computation @xcite seems to be tailored exactly for this purpose , since it is stated in terms of quantum state generation ; let us first explain this framework .",
    "recall that the time evolution of a quantum system s state @xmath21 is described by schrodinger s equation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an operator called the _",
    "hamiltonian _ of the system .",
    "we will consider systems of @xmath9 qubits ; @xmath24 is then taken to be _ local _",
    ", i.e. a sum of operators , each operating on a constant number of qubits .",
    "this captures the physical restriction that interactions in nature involve only a small number of particles , and means that the hamiltonian @xmath23 can actually be implemented in the lab .",
    "adiabatic evolution concerns the case in which @xmath23 varies very slowly in time ; the qualitative statement of the adiabatic theorem is that if the quantum system is initialized in the ground state ( the eigenstate with lowest eigenvalue ) of @xmath25 , and if the modification of @xmath24 in time is done slowly enough , namely _ adiabatically _",
    ", then the final state will be the ground state of the final hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "recently , farhi , goldstone , gutmann and sipser @xcite suggested to use adiabatic evolutions to solve @xmath27-hard languages .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such adiabatic evolutions can be simulated efficiently on a quantum circuit , and so designing such a successful process would imply a quantum efficient algorithm for the problem .",
    "farhi _ et . al . _",
    "s idea was to find the minimum of a given function @xmath28 as follows : @xmath25 is chosen to be some generic hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath26 is chosen to be the _ problem hamiltonian _ , namely a matrix which has the values of @xmath28 on its diagonal and zero everywhere else .",
    "the system is then initialized in the ground state of @xmath25 and evolves adiabatically on the convex line @xmath29 . by the adiabatic theorem",
    "if the evolution is slow enough , the final state will be the groundstate of @xmath26 which is exactly the sought after minimum of @xmath28 .",
    "the efficiency of these adiabatic algorithms is determined by how slow the adiabatic evolution needs to be for the adiabatic theorem to hold .",
    "it turns out that this depends mainly on the _ spectral gaps _ of the hamiltonians @xmath23 .",
    "if these spectral gaps are not too small , the modification of the hamiltonians can be done fairly fast , and",
    "the adiabatic algorithm then becomes efficient .",
    "the main problem in analyzing the efficiency of adiabatic algorithms is thus lower bounding the spectral gap ; this is a very difficult task in general , and hence not much is known analytically about adiabatic algorithms .",
    "@xcite analyze numerically the performance of adiabatic algorithms on random instances of np complete problems .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that grover s quadratic speed up @xcite can be achieved adiabatically .",
    "lower bounds for special cases were given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that adiabatic evolution with local hamiltonians is in fact equivalent in computational power to the standard quantum computation model .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to use the language of adiabatic evolutions , hamiltonians , ground states and spectral gaps as a theoretical framework for _ quantum state generation_. our goal is not to replace the quantum circuit model , neither to improve on it , but rather to develop a paradigm , or a language , in which quantum state generation can be studied conveniently .",
    "the advantage in using the hamiltonian language is that the task of quantum state generation becomes much more natural , since adiabatic evolution is cast in the language of state generation .",
    "furthermore , as we will see , it seems that this language lends itself more easily than the standard circuit model to developing general tools .    in order to provide a framework for the study of state generation using the adiabatic language ,",
    "we define _ adiabatic quantum state generation _ as general as we can .",
    "thus , we replace the requirement that the hamiltonians are on a straight line , with hamiltonians on any general path .",
    "second , we replace the requirement that the hamiltonians are local , with the requirement that they are _ simulatable _ , i.e. , that the unitary matrix @xmath30 can be approximated by a quantum circuit to within any polynomial accuracy for any polynomially bounded time @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we still use the standard model of quantum circuits in our paradigm . however , our goal is to derive quantum circuits solving the state generation problem , from adiabatic state generation algorithms .",
    "indeed , any adiabatic state generator can be simulated efficiently by a quantum circuit .",
    "we give two proofs of this fact .",
    "the first proof follows from the adiabatic theorem .",
    "the second proof is self contained , and does not require knowledge of the adiabatic theorem .",
    "instead it uses the simple zeno effect@xcite , thus providing an alternative point of view of adiabatic algorithms using measurements ( such a path was taken also in @xcite . )",
    "this implies that adiabatic state generators can be used as a framework for designing algorithms for quantum state generation .",
    "we next describe two basic and general tools for designing adiabatic state generators .",
    "the first question that one encounters is naturally , what kind of hamiltonians can be used . in other words , when is it possible to simulate , or implement , a hamiltonian efficiently .",
    "to this end we prove the _ sparse hamiltonian lemma _ which gives a very general condition for a hamiltonian to be simulatable .",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath24 on @xmath9 qubits is row - sparse if the number of non - zero entries at each row is polynomially bounded .",
    "@xmath24 is said to be row - computable if there exists a ( quantum or classical ) efficient algorithm that given @xmath32 outputs a list @xmath33 running over all non zero entries @xmath34 . as a norm for hamiltonians we use the spectral norm , i.e. the operator norm induced by the @xmath35 norm on states .    *",
    "( the sparse hamiltonian lemma)*. [ sparse ] if @xmath24 is a row - sparse , row - computable hamiltonian on @xmath9 qubits and @xmath36 , then @xmath24 is simulatable .",
    "we note that this general lemma is useful also in two other contexts : first , in the context of simulating complicated physical systems on a quantum circuit .",
    "second , for continuous quantum walks @xcite which use hamiltonians .",
    "for example , in @xcite hamiltonians are used to derive an exponential quantum speed up using quantum walks .",
    "our lemma can be used directly to simplify the hamiltonian implementation used in @xcite and to remove the unnecessary constraints ( namely coloring of the nodes ) which were assumed for the sake of simulating the hamiltonian .",
    "the next question that one encounters in designing adiabatic quantum state generation algorithms concerns bounding the spectral gap , which as we mentioned before is a difficult task .",
    "we would like to develop tools to find paths in the hamiltonian space such that the spectral gaps are guaranteed to be non negligible , i.e. larger than @xmath37 .",
    "our next lemma provides a way to do this in certain cases .",
    "denote @xmath38 to be the ground state of @xmath24 ( if unique . )",
    "* ( the jagged adiabatic path lemma)*. [ jagged ] let @xmath39 be a sequence of simulatable hamiltonians on @xmath9 qubits , all with polynomially bounded norm , non - negligible spectral gaps and with groundvalues @xmath40 , such that the inner product between the unique ground states @xmath41 and @xmath42 is non negligible for all @xmath43 .",
    "then there is an efficient quantum algorithm that takes @xmath44 to within arbitrarily small distance from @xmath45 .    to prove this lemma ,",
    "the naive idea is to use the sequence of hamiltonians as _ stepping stones _ for the adiabatic computation , connecting @xmath46 to @xmath47 by a straight line to create the path @xmath23 .",
    "however this way the spectral gaps along the way might be small .",
    "instead we use two simple ideas , which we can turn into two more useful tools for manipulating hamiltonians for adiabatic state generation .",
    "the first idea is to replace each hamiltonian @xmath46 by the hamiltonian @xmath48 which is the projection on the subspace orthogonal to the ground states of @xmath46 .",
    "we show how to implement these projections using kitaev s phase estimation algorithm @xcite .",
    "the second useful idea is to connect by straight lines projections on states with non negligible inner product .",
    "we show that the hamiltonians on such a line are guaranteed to have non negligible spectral gap .",
    "these ideas can be put together to show that the jagged adiabatic path connecting the projections @xmath48 is guaranteed to have sufficiently large spectral gap .",
    "we use the above tools to show that    [ equi ] any quantum state that can be efficiently generated in the circuit model , can also be efficiently generated by an adiabatic state generation algorithm , and vice versa .",
    "thus the question of the complexity of quantum state generation is equivalent ( up to polynomial terms ) in the circuit model and in the adiabatic state generation model .    in the final part of the paper",
    "we demonstrate how our methods for adiabatic quantum state generation work in a particularly interesting domain , namely qsampling from the limiting distributions of markov chains .",
    "there is an interesting connection between rapidly mixing markov chains and adiabatic computation .",
    "a markov chain is rapidly mixing if and only if the second eigenvalue gap , namely the difference between the largest and second largest eigenvalue of the markov matrix @xmath49 , is non negligible @xcite .",
    "this clearly bears resemblance to the adiabatic condition of a non negligible spectral gap , and suggests to look at hamiltonians of the form    @xmath50    @xmath51 will be a hamiltonian if @xmath49 is symmetric ; if @xmath49 is not symmetric but is a reversible markov chain @xcite we can still define the hamiltonian corresponding to it ( see section [ app ] . )",
    "the sparse hamiltonian lemma has as an immediate corollary that for a special type of markov chains , which we call _ strongly samplable _ , the quantum analog of the markov chain can be implemented :    [ th3 ] if @xmath49 is a strongly samplable markov chain , then @xmath51 is simulatable .    in adiabatic computation one",
    "is interested in sequences of hamiltonians ; we thus consider sequences of strongly samplable markov chains .",
    "there is a particularly interesting paradigm in the study of markov chains where sequences of markov chains are repeatedly used : approximate counting @xcite . in approximate",
    "counting the idea is to start from a markov chain on a set that is easy to count , and which is contained in a large set @xmath52 the size of which we want to estimate ; one then slowly increases the set on which the markov chain operates so as to finally get to the desired set @xmath52 .",
    "this paradigm and modifications of it , in which the markov chains are modified slightly until the desired markov chain is attained , are a commonly used tool in many algorithms ; a notable example is the recent algorithm for approximating the permanent @xcite . in the last part of the paper",
    "we show how to use our techniques to translate such approximate counting algorithms in order to quantum sample from the limiting distributions of the final markov chain .",
    "we show :    [ approxi ] ( loosely : ) let @xmath17 be an efficient randomized algorithm to approximately count a set @xmath52 , possibly with weights ; suppose @xmath17 uses slowly varying markov chains starting from a simple markov chain .",
    "then there is an efficient quantum algorithm @xmath12 that qsamples from the final limiting distribution over @xmath52 .",
    "we stress that it is not the case that we are interested in a quantum speed up for sampling from various distributions but rather we are interested in the _ coherent _ qsample of the classical distribution .",
    "we exploit this paradigm to qsample from the set of all perfect matchings of a bipartite graph , using the recent algorithm by jerrum , sinclair and vigoda @xcite . using the same ideas we can also qsample from all linear extensions of partial orders , using bubley and dyer algorithm @xcite , from all lattice points in a convex body satisfying certain restrictions using applegate - kannan technique @xcite and from many more states .",
    "we note that some of these states ( perhaps all ) can be generated using standard techniques which exploit the self reducibility of the problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we stress however that our techniques are qualitatively and significantly different from previous techniques for generating quantum states , and in particular do not require self reducibility",
    ". this can be important for extending this approach to other quantum states .",
    "in this paper we have set the grounds for the general study of the problem of qsampling and adiabatic quantum state generation , where we have suggested to use the language of hamiltonians and ground states for quantum state generation .",
    "this direction points at very interesting and intriguing connections between quantum computation and many different areas : the complexity class szk and its complete problem _ statistical difference _",
    "@xcite , the notion of adiabatic evolution @xcite , the study of rapidly mixing markov chains using spectral gaps @xcite , quantum walks @xcite , and the study of ground states and spectral gaps of hamiltonians in physics .",
    "hopefully , these connections will point at various techniques from these areas which can be borrowed to give more tools for adiabatic quantum state generation ; notably , the study of spectral gaps of hamiltonians in physics is a lively area with various recently developed techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it seems that a much deeper understanding of the adiabatic paradigm is required , in order to solve the most interesting open question , namely to design interesting new quantum algorithms .",
    "an open question which might help in the task is to present known quantum algorithms , eg .",
    "shor s dlog algorithm , or the quadratic residuosity algorithm , in the language of adiabatic computation , in an insightful way .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with the results related to szk ; we then describe quantum adiabatic computation , define the adiabatic quantum state generation framework , and use the adiabatic theorem to prove that an adiabatic state generator implies a state generation algorithm .",
    "next we prove our two main tools : the sparse hamiltonian lemma , and the jagged adiabatic path lemma .",
    "we then use these tools to prove that adiabatic state generation is equivalent to standard quantum state generation .",
    "finally we draw the connection to markov chains and demonstrate how to use our techniques to qsample from approximately countable sets . in the appendix",
    "we give the second proof of transforming adiabatic state generators to algorithms using the zeno effect .",
    "we start with some background about statistical zero knowledge . for an excellent source on this subject , see vadhan s thesis @xcite or sahai and vadhan @xcite .",
    "a pair @xmath53 is a promise problem if @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we look at @xmath57 as the set of all _ yes _ instances , @xmath58 as the set of all _ no _ instances and we do not care about all other inputs .",
    "if every @xmath59 is in @xmath60 we call @xmath61 a language .",
    "we say a promise problem @xmath61 has an interactive proof with soundness error @xmath62 and completeness error @xmath63 if there exists an interactive protocol between a prover @xmath64 and a verifier @xmath65 denoted by @xmath66 , where @xmath65 is a probabilistic polynomial time machine , and    * if @xmath67 @xmath65 accepts with probability at least @xmath68 . *",
    "if @xmath69 then _ for every _ prover @xmath70 , @xmath65 accepts with probability at most @xmath62 .    when an interactive proof system @xmath71 for a promise problem @xmath61 is run on an input @xmath72 , it produces a distribution over `` transcripts '' that contain the conversation between the prover and the verifier .",
    "i.e. , each possible transcript appears with some probability ( depending on the random coin tosses of the prover and the verifier ) .",
    "an interactive proof system @xmath71 for a promise problem @xmath61 is said to be `` honest verifier statistical zero knowledge '' , and in short hvszk , if there exists a probabilistic polynomial time simulator @xmath73 that for every @xmath67 produces a distribution on transcripts that is close ( in the @xmath74 distance defined below ) to the distribution on transcripts in the real proof .",
    "if the simulated distribution is exactly the correct distribution , we say the proof system is \" honest verifier _ perfect _ zero knowledge , and in short hvpzk .",
    "we stress that the simulator s output is based on the input alone , and the simulator has no access to the prover .",
    "also , note that we only require the simulator to produce a good distribution on inputs in @xmath57 , and we do not care about other inputs .",
    "this is because for `` no '' instances there is no correct proof anyway .",
    "we refer the interested reader to vadhan s thesis @xcite for rigorous definitions and a discussion of their subtleties .",
    "the definition of hvszk captures exactly the notion of `` zero knowledge '' ; if the honest verifier can simulate the interaction with the prover by himself , in case the input is in @xmath61 , then he does not learn anything from the interaction ( except for the knowledge that the input is in @xmath61 ) .",
    "we denote by hvszk the class of all promise problems that have an interactive proof which satisfies these restrictions .",
    "one can wonder whether cheating verifiers can get information from an honest prover by deviating from the protocol .",
    "indeed , in some interactive proofs this happens .",
    "however , a general result says that any hvszk proof can be simulated by one which does not leak much information even with dishonest verifiers @xcite .",
    "we thus denote by szk the class of all promise problems which have interactive proof systems which are statistically zero knowledge against an honest ( or equivalently a general ) verifier .",
    "it is known that @xmath75 and that szk is closed under complement .",
    "it follows that szk does not contain any np  complete language unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses . for this , and other results known about this elegant class , we refer the reader , again , to vadhan s thesis @xcite .",
    "recently , sahai and vadhan found a natural complete problem for the class statistical zero knowledge , denoted by szk .",
    "one nice thing about the problem is that it does not mention interactive proofs in any explicit or implicit way .",
    "we need some facts about distances between distributions in order to define the problem .",
    "for two classical distributions @xmath76 define their @xmath74 distance and their _ fidelity _ ( this measure is known by many other names as well ) : @xmath77 we also define the variation distance to be @xmath78 so that it is a value between @xmath40 and @xmath79 .",
    "the following fact is very useful :    [ fact : fidelity - trace ] ( see @xcite ) @xmath80 or equivalently @xmath81    we can now define the complete problem for szk :    * statistical difference ( @xmath82 ) *    input : :    : two classical circuits @xmath83 with @xmath10    boolean outputs .",

    "we do the following :    * we generate @xmath513 , where @xmath10 in the matching on the bipartite graph induced by @xmath514 .",
    "we can efficiently generate this state because we can generate a super - position over all permutations in @xmath515 , and there is an easy computation from a permutation to a perfect matching in a complete bipartite graph and vice versa .",
