    "traditionally , pion photoproduction reactions @xmath8 have played a crucial role in studies that aim at elucidating the excitation spectrum of baryons .",
    "the study of the far weaker kaon photoproduction channels is currently gaining momentum , thanks to the construction of a number of dedicated photon and electron accelerator facilities in the few gev photon and electron energy regime .",
    "it is believed that the involvement of a @xmath9 quark anti - quark pair in the reaction process opens a new window on the dynamics of excited nucleon states and can help in shedding light on the complex and not so well understood field of baryon spectroscopy .",
    "recently , accurate measurements for the three reactions @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been reported @xcite . in the baryon resonance region , the observed total cross sections for all three channels are of the order of a few microbarns .",
    "a property which is specifically related to the production of @xmath6 hyperons , is the anticipated role of the isospin @xmath3 @xmath4 resonances in the reaction dynamics , which are excluded from participating in @xmath13 photoproduction because of arguments based on isospin conservation . as such",
    ", the @xmath14 channel can act as an isospin filter to study those @xmath4 resonances . in comparison to the @xmath15 process",
    ", the description of @xmath6 photoproduction within the context of isobar models appears less attractive , as the freedom to excite @xmath4 states increases the number of candidates , and correspondingly the number of parameters , for intermediate resonant states . an important feature which helps in minimizing the number of free parameters , though , is the observation that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are part of the @xmath6 isospin triplet .",
    "consequently , one can rely on isospin symmetry to relate the coupling constants needed in the description of the @xmath18 reaction to those required for the @xmath19 process .",
    "within such a scheme , a common analysis of both reaction channels becomes possible .    in this work",
    ", we aim at studying @xmath6 photoproduction at the so - called `` tree level '' , where only first - order feynman graphs are taken into account .",
    "this implies that all higher - order terms , which for example account for final - state interaction effects , are being discarded .",
    "also the unitarity constraint is not fully obeyed at tree level . a recent coupled - channel analysis @xcite , specifically designed to include coupled - channel effects in the description of strangeness photoproduction channels ,",
    "reports that the effect of coupled - channel mechanisms on the cross sections is of the order of 20% .",
    "admittedly , this is a substantial effect . on the other hand , in the tree - level analysis presented here , we observe substantial model dependences .",
    "they give rise to variations in some of the extracted coupling constants up to a factor of two .",
    "the major source of the model uncertainties stems from the treatment of the background or non - resonant feynman diagrams . in the light of this ,",
    "we reckon that a profound understanding of the tree - level contributions to hyperon photoproduction processes is imperative .",
    "we are convinced that full - blown coupled - channel analyses will also benefit from an improved understanding of the tree - level contributions to the strangeness photoproduction reactions .    in this work , we extend our tree - level analysis of the @xmath13 photoproduction data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath6 channel .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : isobar ] , we will discuss the isobar model for hyperon photoproduction on the nucleon .",
    "special attention will be paid to the peculiar role played by the born diagrams . in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] we then present the results of our numerical calculations . in [ sec : res_contr ] , we explore the dominant resonance contributions and in [ sec : back_cont ] we investigate various schemes to implement the non - resonant background terms . in [ sec : radcap ] , we discuss in how far the crossing symmetric @xmath20 process provides additional constraints for the description of the @xmath6 photoproduction reaction . sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the appendix summarizes the use of isospin constraints in relating hadronic and electromagnetic coupling constants .",
    "in this work , the @xmath6 photoproduction reaction on the proton is modeled with the aid of effective lagrangians . in such a framework ,",
    "the physical degrees of freedom are hadrons and their excited states .",
    "every resonance is treated as an individual particle with its own properties , like mass , strong - decay widths and photohelicity amplitudes .",
    "when calculating the leading feynman diagrams , effective - field theories provide the operatorial structure of the interaction vertices and the propagators for the intermediate particles .",
    "the detailed forms of the effective lagrangians for the various couplings can be found in many works ( see for example refs .",
    "the conventions used here are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the lagrangian formalism describes point - like interactions , it is a common procedure to introduce phenomenological form factors at the hadronic vertices .",
    "they do account for the finite extension of the interacting hadrons and the hard ( unknown ) physics at short inter - baryon distances .",
    "we wish to stress that such a phenomenological treatment of the short - distance physics is necessarily model dependent . a widely used parameterization for the hadronic form factors is the dipole form  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the off - shell momentum squared at the vertex and @xmath13 is the cutoff mass that sets the short - distance scale of the effective theory .",
    "it is well known that introducing hadronic form factors violates gauge invariance at the level of the born diagrams .",
    "additional contact terms are then required to restore this fundamental symmetry , a procedure which is not free of ambiguities . in our calculations ,",
    "the gauge - restoring contact terms are determined with the aid of a procedure which was recently suggested by davidson and workman @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this recipe over other schemes , is that the added contact terms do not contain any singularities .",
    "this is not the case for older procedures , like those suggested by ohta @xcite or haberzettl @xcite , which have been adopted in numerous theoretical works dealing with meson induced and meson production reactions .    within the context of an effective - field theory ,",
    "the degree of participation of the different intermediate resonances is determined by the magnitude of the corresponding electromagnetic and strong coupling constants .",
    "those values are not predicted by the theory itself , but should be determined by comparing model calculations to an extensive data set .",
    "the most recently published @xmath18 and @xmath23 data are due to the saphir collaboration at the elsa facility in bonn @xcite .",
    "this data set for @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) photoproduction contains 21 ( 5 ) total and 70 ( 18 ) differential cross section points , as well as 12 ( 4 ) recoil polarization asymmetries over an energy range from threshold up to 2.0 ( 1.55 ) gev . on the basis of these data",

    "the @xmath30 s denote the free parameters ( coupling constants and hadronic form - factor cutoffs ) of the model .",
    "the @xmath31 , @xmath17 and @xmath16 baryons form an isospin triplet . as outlined in the appendix , one can exploit isospin symmetry to establish relations between the hadronic and electromagnetic coupling constants for the different @xmath6 photoproduction channels .",
    "the obvious advantage of such a procedure , is that the @xmath32 and @xmath33 data can be described with one common set of parameters . in principle , the @xmath34 and @xmath35 channels could also be implemented in this scheme @xcite .",
    "data for those reaction channels are sparse , though .",
    "moreover , the procedure of extracting `` elementary '' neutron cross sections from measurements on nuclei , like the deuteron , induces severe model dependences . to make matters even worse",
    ", connecting proton to neutron electromagnetic coupling constants demands the knowledge of the rather poorly known helicity amplitudes for the different nucleon resonances . for all of the above arguments ,",
    "we have excluded from our global analyses the @xmath6 photoproduction channels off the neutron .    even at tree level ,",
    "the description of @xmath36 processes involves a substantial number of feynman diagrams .",
    "the diagrams can be divided into two broad classes , the _ background _ ( or , _ non - resonant _ ) and the _ resonant _ terms .",
    "the latter reflect themselves as @xmath37-channel terms and are esteemed to contain the most relevant physical information .",
    "the extracted coupling constants for the corresponding resonant states constitute the bridge between the photoproduction measurements and quark - model predictions @xcite . however , the implementation of the background contributions in the description of @xmath38 processes is far from being a trivial task .",
    "the background contains several classes of feynman graphs .",
    "first the born terms , involving an off - shell proton in the @xmath37-channel , a k meson exchange in the @xmath39-channel and hyperon exchange in the @xmath40-channel .",
    "second , there are terms involving the exchange of a @xmath41 vector meson in the @xmath39-channel and @xmath42 hyperon resonances in the @xmath40-channel .",
    "some models dealing with @xmath13 and @xmath6 photoproduction have neglected these resonant @xmath40-channel terms @xcite .",
    "the exchange of @xmath41 and @xmath42 particles in the @xmath39- and @xmath40-channel are perceived as background and not as resonant diagrams , as they do not possess poles in the physical region of the reaction .",
    "it is a notable fact that the born terms on their own exhibit rather intriguing characteristics when it comes to modeling the @xmath43 and @xmath0 reaction dynamics .",
    "the born terms only depend on two parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are in principle strictly related to the well - determined @xmath46 coupling constant through su(3 ) flavor symmetry . in practice ,",
    "su(3 ) is a broken symmetry and at best some `` realistic '' ranges for @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be set .",
    "reasonable ranges , corresponding with deviations of 20% from the su(3 ) predictions , are :    [ eq : su3rel ] @xmath49    purely hadronic processes , such as @xmath50 scattering @xcite or @xmath51 reactions @xcite , can be understood in terms of the su(3)-based coupling constants .",
    "these observations may suggest that there is little room for su(3 ) breaking beyond the aforementioned ranges . in the electromagnetic production of strangeness ,",
    "though , a difficulty emerges @xcite . indeed , using coupling constants which vary within the aforementioned boundaries , the predicted strength from the `` bare '' born terms overshoots the measured @xmath52 cross section by a factor of three or four . in the @xmath6 photoproduction case",
    ", we observe similar qualitative features .",
    "the photon - energy dependence of the total @xmath53 and @xmath23 cross sections , calculated in a model that solely includes the born terms , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : born ] . for both @xmath6 production channels ,",
    "the born terms in themselves strongly overpredict the measurements . for the curves of fig .  [",
    "fig : born ] we adopt the values @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "they correspond with the smallest absolute couplings which are allowed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : su3rel ] ) . when adopting couplings based on exact su(3 ) symmetry , the overprediction becomes even more severe .",
    "an intriguing observation is that , under the constraints of eq .",
    "( [ eq : su3rel ] ) , the major fraction of the born strength in the @xmath56 channel is stemming from the so - called `` extended '' born diagram which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : ext_born ] .    in this diagram , a @xmath13",
    "is produced in the @xmath40-channel and converted into a @xmath16 at the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "the dominance of this term can be attributed to the large value of @xmath44 compared to @xmath45 . as a matter of fact",
    ", this implies that the major part of the background cross section in @xmath16 production is dominated by @xmath13 exchange in the @xmath40-channel . due to charge conservation",
    ", @xmath13 exchange can not contribute to the born terms for @xmath17 photoproduction . in the @xmath57 channel ,",
    "the born contributions consist only of proton exchange in the @xmath37-channel and @xmath17 exchange in the @xmath40-channel .",
    "remark that also the @xmath39-channel does not contribute since the photon does not couple to the neutral @xmath58 meson . despite the restricted number of background diagrams ,",
    "the two born terms produce far more strength than in the @xmath16 photoproduction case .",
    "this can be partly attributed to the @xmath59 coupling constant which is , according to the relation ( [ eq : skn ] ) , a factor of @xmath60 larger than @xmath45 and partly to the values of the corresponding anomalous magnetic moments ( @xmath61 = 1.458 , @xmath62 = 0.79 ) @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    "it may become clear that apart from introducing resonances , it is mandatory to add model ingredients that properly counterbalance the strength produced by the `` bare '' born terms . in @xmath13 photoproduction , where one comes across a similar difficulty , we discussed three schemes in which this goal could be accomplished @xcite .",
    "first , it is well - known that for sufficiently low values of the cutoff mass @xmath13 in the hadronic form factors of eq .",
    "( [ eq : formfac ] ) , the strength stemming from the born terms can be adequately suppressed without invoking other mechanisms .",
    "it turns out that in such a scheme an appropriate description of the @xmath13 photoproduction data can solely be achieved with cutoff masses of the order of the kaon mass .",
    "this is a rather inconvenient situation for an effective - field theory .",
    "second , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that for the @xmath52 process , the introduction of hyperon resonances ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) in the @xmath40-channel permits to naturally cut down the strength from the born terms through destructive interferences .",
    "such a scheme offers the obvious advantage of describing the photoproduction data with cutoff masses of a few times the kaon mass . as a third alternative , the constraints from ( broken ) su(3)-flavor symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : su3rel ] ) can be simply disregarded .",
    "it goes without saying that after sufficiently reducing the @xmath47 and @xmath45 couplings , one can ( artificially ) force the strength from the born diagrams to approach the magnitude of the measured cross sections .    in this work",
    ", we extend our description of @xmath13 photoproduction @xcite to the @xmath6 production channels . building on the knowledge gained in @xmath13 photoproduction , in sec .",
    "[ sec : back_cont ] we will present various schemes to implement the background diagrams in modeling @xmath65 reactions . first , however , we will look for a proper set of resonances to describe the currently available @xmath65 data in sec .",

    "most importantly , whereas model a is based on @xmath67 coupling constants respecting ( broken ) su(3 ) flavor symmetry , model c does not impose any constraints of that type .",
    "however , it appears that respecting su(3 ) flavor symmetry comes at a certain price .",
    "indeed , when adopting su(3 ) constraints on the @xmath67 values , one appears to be forced to either introduce ( unrealistically ) soft hadronic form factors ( model a ) , or implement additional @xmath40-channel diagrams ( model b ) to destructively interfere with the born terms . in the literature on @xmath68",

    "the measured decay widths for the @xmath130 and @xmath131 vector mesons are @xcite : @xmath132 in principle , one can determine the value of the magnetic transition moment on the basis of the proportionality @xmath133 . within the context of isobar models , however , the coupling constants are frequently considered as `` effective couplings '' wherein , for example , part of final - state interaction effects are absorbed . it is a common procedure to use only the ratios of the measured decay widths to connect isospin related coupling constants .",
    "this leads to the following expression : @xmath134 or : @xmath135 the relative sign in the last expression was allocated on the basis of a cqm prediction @xcite .",

    ", it is easily proven that they are sensitive to the isospin of the final state . to determine the electromagnetic vertex coupling at a neutron target from the knowledge of the electromagnetic coupling at a proton target , those differences have to be taken into account .",
    "we adopt the same procedure as for the vector - meson transition moments and use the experimental amplitudes as a conversion coefficient .",
    "the expressions , which directly follow from the interaction lagrangians , read : @xmath136 where @xmath102 refers to even / odd parity .",
    "note that some of these helicity amplitudes are rather poorly known , especially those of the neutron .",
    "for the electromagnetic decay of the @xmath4 resonances the following simple relation holds : @xmath137 regardless of the spin state of the @xmath4 resonance .",

    ", one can make use of the same procedure adopted for the @xmath41 and @xmath2 transition moment and take the ratio of the helicity amplitudes as a conversion coefficient . due to the lack of knowledge about the latter quantities , we have used ratio s of the @xmath6 ground state transition moments as conversion coefficients .",
