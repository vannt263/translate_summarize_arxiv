    "so , condition ( [ eqcccond ] ) can be considered as a condition of possibility of classical key distribution with an arbitrary security degree .",

    "@xmath113 then , in view of ( [ eqqccond ] ) , @xmath114 since for any @xmath115 , in view of the conditions on the adversary s measurements class , @xmath116 this implies that @xmath117    then , since the adversary can perform only individual measurements with the subsequent classical processing , the conditions of theorem [ theocsiszar ] are satisfied .",
    "thus , it is possible that for a single use of a quantum channel the classical condition ( [ eqcccond ] ) of key distribution is not satisfied , but with multiple repetitions bob uses the essentially quantum property , entangled measurements , in contrast to the adversary eve , who performs in essence classical attacks  factorized measurements . as a result , bob achieves advantage over eve and the subsequent key distribution according to the classical scheme becomes possible .    for demonstration of this possibility",
    "we give an example of the quantum key distribution system , in which at every run of the quantum channel eve receive the same state as bob , i.e. , there is an ideal eavesdropping .",
    "however , as a consequence of the effect of entangled measurements applying by bob with the multiple use of the channel , he gets more information than eve , and the key distribution becomes possible .",
    "the effect of entangled measurements is caused by the use of nonorthogonal states .",
    "let @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath4 is an identical map .",
    "@xmath120 , @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 if for @xmath14 the condition @xmath124 or @xmath125 is satisfied , then @xmath126 we have @xmath127 so @xmath128 is achieved when @xmath129 .",
    "then , due to the fact that the operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 do nt commute , condition ( [ eqqccond ] ) is satisfied .",
    "so , by theorem [ theoour ] the key distribution is possible .    there are nt analogues in classical cryptography for the given effect when the key distribution is possible even under conditions of ideal eavesdropping . in this sense",
    "one can say about advantages of quantum cryptography over classical one .",
