    "in short , the purpose of this work is to provide explicit criteria for the functional weak convergence of properly rescaled markov chains on @xmath3 .",
    "since it is well - known from the work of lamperti @xcite that self - similar processes arise as the scaling limit of general stochastic processes , and since in the case of markov chains , one naturally expects the markov property to be preserved after convergence , scaling limits of rescaled markov chains on @xmath4 should thus belong to the class of self - similar markov processes on @xmath5 .",
    "the latter have been also introduced by lamperti @xcite , who pointed out a remarkable connexion with real - valued lvy processes which we shall recall later on .",
    "considering the powerful arsenal of techniques which are nowadays available for establishing convergence in distribution for sequences of markov processes ( see in particular ethier & kurtz @xcite and jacod & shiryaev @xcite ) , it seems that the study of scaling limits of general markov chains on @xmath4 should be part of the folklore . roughly speaking ,",
    "it is well - known that weak convergence of feller processes amounts to the convergence of infinitesimal generators ( in some appropriate sense ) , and the path should thus be essentially well - paved .",
    "however , there is a major obstacle for this natural approach .",
    "namely , there is a delicate issue regarding the boundary of self - similar markov processes on @xmath5 : in some cases , @xmath6 is an absorbing boundary , in some other , @xmath6 is an entrance boundary , and further @xmath6 can also be a reflecting boundary , where the reflection can be either continuous or by a jump .",
    "see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "analytically , this raises the questions of identifying a core for a self - similar markov process on @xmath5 and of determining its infinitesimal generator on this core , in particular on the neighborhood of the boundary point @xmath6 where a singularity appears . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", these questions remain open in general , and investigating the asymptotic behavior of a sequence of infinitesimal generators at a singular point therefore seems rather subtle .",
    "a few years ago , haas & miermont @xcite obtained a general scaling limit theorem for non - increasing markov chains on @xmath4 ( observe that plainly , @xmath7 is always an absorbing boundary for non - increasing self - similar markov processes ) , and the purpose of the present work is to extend their result by removing the non - increase assumption .",
    "our approach bears similarities with that developed by haas & miermont , but also with some differences . in short , haas and",
    "miermont first established a tightness result , and then analyzed weak limits of convergent subsequences via martingale problems , whereas we rather investigate asymptotics of infinitesimal generators .",
    "more precisely , in order to circumvent the crucial difficulty related to the boundary point @xmath6 , we shall not directly study the rescaled version of the markov chain , but rather of a time - changed version .",
    "the time - substitution is chosen so to yield weak convergence towards the exponential of a lvy process , where the convergence is established through the analysis of infinitesimal generators .",
    "the upshot is that cores and infinitesimal generators are much better understood for lvy processes and their exponentials than for self - similar markov processes , and boundaries yield no difficulty .",
    "we are then left with the inversion of the time - substitution , and this turns out to be closely related to the lamperti transformation . however , although our approach enables us to treat the situation when the markov chain is either absorbed at the boundary point @xmath7 or eventually escapes to @xmath8 , it does not seem to provide direct access to the case when the limiting process is reflected at the boundary ( see figure [ fig : mc ] ) .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows .",
    "our general results are presented in section [ sec : description ] .",
    "we state three main limit theorems , namely theorems [ thm : main1 ] , [ thm : main2 ] and [ thm : main3 ] , each being valid under some specific set of assumptions .",
    "roughly speaking , theorem [ thm : main1 ] treats the situation where the markov chain is transient and thus escapes to @xmath8 , whereas theorem [ thm : main2 ] deals with the recurrent case . in the latter ,",
    "we only consider the markov chain until its first entrance time in some finite set , which forces absorption at the boundary point @xmath6 for the scaling limit .",
    "theorem [ thm : main3 ] is concerned with the situation where the markov chain is positive recurrent ; then convergence of the properly rescaled chain to a self - similar markov process absorbed at @xmath6 is established , even though the markov chain is no longer trapped in some finite set . finally , we also provide a weak limit theorem ( theorem [ thm : absorption ] ) in the recurrent situation for the first instant when the markov chain started from a large level enters some fixed finite set .",
    "section [ sec : aux ] prepares the proofs of the preceding results , by focusing on an auxiliary continuous - time markov chain which is both closely related to the genuine discrete - time markov chain and easier to study .",
    "the connexion between the two relies on a lamperti - type transformation .",
    "the proofs of the statements made in section [ sec : description ] are then given in section [ sec : scaling ] by analyzing the time - substitution ; classical arguments relying on the celebrated foster criterion for recurrence of markov chains also play a crucial role .",
    "we illustrate our general results in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "first , we check that they encompass those of haas & miermont in the case where the chain is non - increasing .",
    "then we derive functional limit theorems for markov chains with asymptotically zero drift ( this includes the so - called bessel - type random walks which have been considered by many authors in the literature ) , scaling limits are then given in terms of bessel processes .",
    "lastly , we derive a weak limit theorem for the number of particles in a fragmentation - coagulation process , of a type similar to that introduced by j. berestycki @xcite",
    ". finally , in section 6 , we point at a series of open questions related to this work .",
    "we conclude this introduction by mentioning that our initial motivation for establishing such scaling limits for markov chains on @xmath4 was a question raised by nicolas curien concerning the study of random planar triangulations and their connexions with compensated fragmentations which has been developed in a subsequent work @xcite .",
