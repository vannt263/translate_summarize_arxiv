    "mathematically , the huygens principle is represented by a formula in which the frequency  domain electromagnetic fields in a closed , source  free region are expressed in terms of the tangential components of the electromagnetic fields on the surface bounding the region .",
    "a convenient means of expressing this formula is provided by the dyadic green functions appropriate to the medium filling the region ( felsen & marcuvitz , 1994 ) .",
    "accordingly , the huygens principle plays a central role in electromagnetic scattering theory .",
    "it may be applied , for example , to the analysis of diffraction from an aperture , wherein the aperture is formally represented as an equivalent source ( chen , 1983 ) ; likewise , it can be used to formulate the ewald ",
    "oseen extinction theorem and the t  matrix method ( lakhtakia , 1994 ) .",
    "while the huygens principle for isotropic dielectric  magnetic mediums is a staple of standard textbooks , exact formulations for more complex mediums are generally unavailable .",
    "this general unavailability mirrors the scarcity of exact formulations of dyadic green functions for complex mediums .",
    "notable exceptions to this include the huygens principle for isotropic chiral mediums ( lakhtakia , 1992 ) and uniaxial dielectric mediums ( bergstein & zachos , 1966 ; lakhtakia , varadan , & varadan , 1989 ) .",
    "a formulation of the huygens principle for a generally anisotropic dielectric medium was established by ogg ( 1971 ) , but it does not yield explicit expressions as it employs a spectral representation of the dyadic green functions .",
    "tai ( 1994 ) developed a formulation of the huygens principle for a simply  moving isotropic dielectric medium , based on the minkowski constitutive relations .",
    "however , these constitutive relations describe only nondispersive mediums and are less general than the ones implemented in this communication .",
    "we present here a formulation of the huygens principle for a general uniaxial dielectric  magnetic medium ( weiglhofer , 1990 ) with gyrotropic magnetoelectric properties ( lakhtakia & weiglhofer , 1990 ) . a harmonic time ",
    "dependence of @xmath0 is implicit in the following sections .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous bianisotropic medium characterized by the frequency ",
    "domain constitutive relations @xmath1 where the permittivity and permeability dyadics are @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the 3@xmath43 identity dyadic .",
    "hence , the medium exhibits uniaxial dielectric and uniaxial magnetic properties , with the unit vector @xmath5 indicating the direction of the distinguished axis , and the gyrotropic  like magnetoelectric properties mediated by the vector @xmath6 .",
    "the form of the constitutive relations is sufficiently general that a wide range of natural and artificial uniaxial mediums are described by them ( mackay & lakhtakia , 2008 ) .",
    "the incorporation of gyrotropic  like magnetoelectric properties extends the range of mediums described by eqs . to include exotic metamaterials as well as certain simply moving mediums ( lakhtakia & mackay , 2006a ) and mediums inspired by tamm s noncovariant formulation for vacuum in general relativity ( lakhtakia & mackay , 2006b ) .    the frequency ",
    "domain maxwell curl postulates can be set down as @xmath7 wherein @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary electric and magnetic source current density phasors , respectively . in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we use the transformations ( lakhtakia & weiglhofer , 1997 ) @xmath10 of the field and source phasors .",
    "thereby , eqs .",
    "transform to @xmath11 which yield the helmholtzian equations @xmath12",
    "let us now reproduce the dyadic green functions for a uniaxial dielectric  magnetic medium , as derived by weiglhofer ( 1990 ) , for convenience as they are essential for the analysis in the next section .",
    "the linearity of eqs .",
    "ensures that their solution may be expressed as @xmath13 where the integrations range over the region where @xmath14 are not null  valued .",
    "herein , the 3@xmath43 dyadic green functions @xmath15 @xmath16 satisfy the equations @xmath17 which decouple to provide the system of second order differential equations @xmath18 with @xmath19 representing the dirac delta function . these are the dyadic green functions of a uniaxial dielectric  magnetic medium which are known to be ( weiglhofer , 1990 ) @xmath20 the scalar green functions @xmath21 in eqs . are defined by @xmath22 while the dyadic function @xmath23 is specified as @xmath24 on considering the dyadic transposes , which we denote by the superscript ` t ' , eqs .",
    "reveal the symmetries @xmath25 while interchanging @xmath26 and @xmath27 yields @xmath28",
    "the dyadic green functions may be exploited to derive mathematical statements of the huygens principle pertaining to radiation and scattering in a uniaxial dielectric  magnetic medium with gyrotropic  like magnetoelectric properties .",
    "consider a source  free region @xmath29 , which is occupied by a medium described by the constitutive relations and enclosed by the finite surfaces @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the source phasors @xmath32 ( and @xmath14 )",
    "are nonzero only inside @xmath30 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath33 on @xmath34 is directed into @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce the dyadic function @xmath35 and note that @xmath36 by virtue of the identity @xmath37 and the fact that the dyadic @xmath38 is symmetric . the dyadic divergence theorem ( tai , 1994 ; van bladel , 1985 )",
    "@xmath39 then yields @xmath40\\ ; d^2 \\#r,\\hspace{10 mm } & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after using the identity @xmath41 . now",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath42 can be employed , together with the symmetry of the constitutive dyadic @xmath43 and the fact that there are no sources in @xmath29 , to evaluate the integral on the left side of eq . .",
    "thus , we find @xmath44\\ ; d^2 \\#r , \\qquad \\#r ' \\in v_e.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , let @xmath31 be sufficiently distant from @xmath30 that the integral herein on the surface @xmath31 is eliminated by virtue of satisfaction of appropriate radiation conditions by the dyadic green functions ( felsen & marcuvitz , 1994 ) .",
    "equations @xmath42 and @xmath45 allow the curl terms in the integrand of eq . to be replaced by explicit terms ;",
    "hence , @xmath46 on interchanging @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and exploiting the symmetries of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 listed in eqs . and",
    ", it emerges that @xmath50 and , lastly , after inverting the transformation of @xmath51 presented in eq .",
    "@xmath42 , the huygens principle for the electric field phasor emerges as @xmath52    to find the corresponding expression for the magnetic field phasor , we take the curl of both sides of eq . and utilize eqs .",
    "@xmath53 to get @xmath54 then , exploitation of eqs . @xmath42 and @xmath55 to eliminate the curl terms delivers @xmath56 wherein",
    "the observation point @xmath26 is explicitly excluded from the surface of the source region .",
    "the huygens principle for the magnetic field phasor thus emerges as @xmath57 upon inverting the transformation of @xmath58 presented in eq .",
    "the main results of this communication are eqs . and , which represent formulations of the huygens principle appropriate to the bianisotropic medium described by the constitutive relations .",
    "this is the most general formulation of the huygens principle presently available , as far as we are aware .",
    "we note that the formulation of the huygens principle for a uniaxial dielectric medium derived by lakhtakia , varadan , & varadan ( 1989 ) follows immediately from eqs . and upon setting @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the permeability of free space .",
