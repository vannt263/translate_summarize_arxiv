    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite offers the attractive possibility of resolving many of the puzzles of standard hot big bang cosmology .",
    "the crucial ingredient of most successful inflationary scenarios is a period of `` slow - roll '' evolution of a scalar field @xmath1 ( the `` inflaton '' ) , during which the potential energy @xmath2 stored in @xmath1 dominates its kinetic energy @xmath3 and drives a quasi - exponential expansion of the universe . at present",
    "there exists no preferred concrete inflationary scenario based on a convincing realistic particle physics model .",
    "in particular , though string theory provides one with several very weakly coupled scalar fields ( the moduli ) , which could be natural inflaton candidates , their non - perturbative potentials @xmath2 do not seem fit to sustain slow - roll inflation because , for large values of @xmath1 , they tend either to grow , or to tend to zero , too fast .",
    "it is therefore important to explore novel possibilities for implementing an inflationary evolution of the early universe .",

    "increases_. though we shall motivate below the consideration of non - standard kinetic terms by appealing to the existence , in string theory , of higher - order corrections to the effective action for @xmath1 , we do not claim that the structure needed for implementing our `` kinetically driven '' inflation arises inevitably in string theory .",
    "the aim of this work is more modest .",
    "we draw attention to a new mechanism for implementing inflation . a large class of the ( toy ) models we shall consider satisfy two of the most crucial requirements of inflationary scenarios : ( i ) the scalar perturbations are `` well - behaved '' during the inflationary stage , and ( ii ) there exist natural mechanisms for exiting inflation in a `` graceful '' manner .",
    "we leave to future work a more detailed analysis of the observational consequences of our kinetically driven inflation ( spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations , reheating ,  ) .",
    "we hope that , by enlarging the basic `` tool - kit '' of inflationary cosmology , our mechanism could help to locate which sector of string - theory ( if any ) has inflated a strongly curved initial state into our presently observed large and weakly curved universe .",

    "( [ eq : energy - density ] ) , the energy - density depends also only on @xmath59 : @xmath60 . in hydrodynamical language",

    "the master evolution equation can then be qualitatively solved by looking at the graph of the equation of state @xmath61 .",
    "the shape of this graph depends very much on the shape of the function @xmath58 , or better , on the shape of the function @xmath62 where @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 .",

    "the minus sign means that @xmath56 is positive ( negative ) if the tangent intersects the vertical axis below ( above ) the @xmath69 horizontal axis .",

    "later the latter point lies in the region of absolute instability and has therefore no physical significance .    in this work",

    "note that the `` price '' to pay for having inflationary attractors as in fig .",
    "[ fig : state ] is the existence of regions , in phase space @xmath92 , with negative energy density .",
    "we shall assume in this work that this is not physically forbidden .",
    "all the cosmological evolutions that we shall consider below stay always in the positive energy regions , and the existence , elsewhere in phase space , of negative @xmath56 regions does not necessarily cause some instabilities along our evolutionary tracks .",
    "the simple case of a kinetic lagrangian depending only on @xmath89 considered above is the analog , for kinetically driven inflation ( or `` _",
    "_ k__-inflation '' for short ) , of a de sitter model with constant energy density .",
    "it is clear that both models should have similar problems .",
    "namely , there is no natural graceful exit , no smooth transition to a friedmann universe and the cosmological perturbations are `` ill - defined '' .",
    "to avoid these problems we should allow the coefficients in the expansion ( [ eq : p - expansion ] ) of the lagrangian @xmath8 to depend on the scalar field @xmath23 .",
    "the simplest way to realize successfully the idea of _ k_-inflation is to consider the analog of `` slow - roll '' potential driven inflation , in which the potential @xmath2 in the lagrangian @xmath93 dominates the kinetic term @xmath3 and evolves slowly . for the concept of _ k_-inflation to have a relevance to a large class of models , we need to consider a general kinetic lagrangian @xmath33",
    "the idea is therefore to find the conditions under which the influence of the non - trivial @xmath1 dependence of @xmath33 will represent only a relatively small perturbation of the attraction toward exponential inflation discussed in section [ sec : k - inflation ] . to do that in a concrete manner",

    "when @xmath100 becomes of order unity it is not a priori excluded that @xmath101 could change sign .",
    "for instance we could consider a simple model ( of the type considered in refs .",

    "overall , the qualitative behaviour of the solutions we are focussing on is the following : initially , we start with some representative point in the @xmath154 plane lying on an equation of state graph corresponding to some initial value of @xmath1 , deep into the strong coupling domain .",

    "the function @xmath161 can then be arranged in such a way that the universe leaves the weak coupling regime to enter an inflationary stage and finally exits inflation .",

    "if we restrict ourselves to the inflationary range @xmath204 this speed can not exceed @xmath205 the smaller values of @xmath206 correspond to very fast ( nearly exponential ) expansion and small speed of sound in complete agreement with our analysis of slow - roll _ k_-inflation .",
    "pole - like inflation is violently unstable in this model .",
    "however , if we consider more general lagrangians ( [ eq : general - lagrangian ] ) we can avoid these restrictions .",
    "actually in this case the speed of sound during the inflationary stage is given by the expression @xmath207 where @xmath177 is the solution of equation ( [ eq : solx ] ) .",
    "the necessary conditions for power law inflation given in section [ sec : power - law - kinflation ] imply that @xmath208 and do not involve any restrictions on the second derivative @xmath209 .",
    "therefore , for a power law inflationary stage with any a priori given value of the parameter @xmath167 , one can always find a corresponding function @xmath210 to arrange any required speed of sound .",
    "note that it follows from here that one can also easily build a theory with pole - like inflation which is stable with respect to scalar perturbations .",
    "in the simple model of section [ sec : slow - roll - inflation ] ( and in the normalization @xmath123 ) the total number of inflationary @xmath129-folds is ( considering for definiteness that @xmath23 decreases during slow - roll ) @xmath211 here @xmath212 is the initial value of @xmath23 , and @xmath213 the end of slow - roll , i.e. the value of @xmath23 where @xmath160 becomes of order unity , i.e. ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq : slow - roll - parameter ] ) ) , such that @xmath214    we shall not investigate here the problem of the choice of initial conditions within our model .",
    "we shall assume that some large parameter is present ( or at least possible ) in the problem and allows @xmath215 to be larger that 60 or so .",
    "[ one simple possibility would be a function @xmath216 of the type of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fms - k ] ) which levels off to a negative constant when @xmath1 increases .",
    "all the couples @xmath217 where @xmath218 ( in planck units ) and @xmath1 is arbitrary large lead to an energy density of order @xmath219 . a random initial condition with @xmath220 could have an arbitrary large @xmath23 . ] assuming this we note not only that our mechanism contains a natural exit from inflation ( because of the evolution of @xmath161 and its final change of sign ) , but that this exit is generically expected to take place within a small number of @xmath129-folds .",
    "indeed , condition ( [ eq : slow - roll - end ] ) signalling the end of slow - roll _ k_-inflation can be rewritten ( using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : x - slow - roll])-([eq : h - slow - roll ] ) ) as @xmath221_{\\rm end}\\sim 1 $ ] , which means that @xmath161 changes by 100% in a hubble time , around the time of exit of _ k_-inflation .",
    "one therefore expects that one can approximately match slow - roll _ k_-inflation with a post - inflationary phase where @xmath101 has become positive .",
    "we think that , in most cases , this way of exiting _ k_-inflation provides a naturally graceful exit .",
    "indeed , it is clear from fig . [",
    "fig : model - state ] that , after the transition to the @xmath112 ( `` weak - coupling '' ) branch , the cosmological evolution will quickly be attracted toward an approximate @xmath222 equation of state . the corresponding expansion was discussed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuum - attractor ] ) and corresponds to a very fast decrease of the energy density : @xmath223 .",
    "as this decrease is much faster than the decay of the energy density in radiation ( @xmath224 ) [ and in non relativistic matter ( @xmath225 ) if any is present ] , even small traces of the latter forms of energy present at the end of _",
    "k_-inflation will ultimately dominate the expansion .",
    "the situation is very similar to what has been recently discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "as we have in mind that , in our model , the scalar @xmath23 could be the dilaton ( or a moduli ) , i.e. a field which modifies the coupling constants of all the other matter fields , we expect that the nearly uniform time variation of @xmath23 during _ k_-inflation will generate quantum particles at a uniform spacetime rate . during _",
    "k_-inflation the produced particles are constantly diluted by the fast expansion and are not expected to cause a strong back reaction , but the particles produced in the last @xmath129-fold of _",
    "k_-inflation should be sufficiently numerous to dominate soon the expansion . even without this assumption ( that the couplings of @xmath23 are efficient in producing particles )",
    ", the mere effect of the variable gravitational coupling ( at the end of inflation ) is sufficient to create any scalar particle with energy density ( at birth ) @xmath226 @xcite @xcite .    to discuss more precisely the evolution of the inflaton",
    "after it exits from _ k_-inflation , i.e. when @xmath108 has become positive , and the higher - derivative term @xmath227 has become negligible , it is convenient to introduce the canonical scalar field @xmath228 . in terms of @xmath229",
    "the equation of motion reads @xmath230 , with @xmath231 .",
    "hence @xmath232 and @xmath229 evolves according to @xmath233 . in a first phase after _",
    "k_-inflation @xmath234 probably dominates over @xmath235 and the evolution follows the @xmath115 attractor solution eq .",
    "( [ eq : vacuum - attractor ] ) . during this initial phase",
    "@xmath236 so that @xmath237 drifts logarithmically : @xmath238 . later , @xmath239 will take over @xmath240 and the evolution will become radiation dominated . in this second phase ,",
    "@xmath241 and @xmath242 stops drifting logarithmically to converge toward some final value @xmath243 : @xmath244 .    note that , in this generic exit mechanism , the final value @xmath245 of the original field ( corresponding to the final value @xmath243 of the canonical field ) is arbitrary . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath23 is the dilaton or a moduli our _ k_-inflationary mechanism does not , by itself , provide a mechanism for fixing @xmath23 to a particular value . to do that one must appeal either to the presence , at low - energies , of a @xmath23-dependent potential energy term @xmath246 ( which may have been negligible at high energies ) , or to a non - trivial structure of couplings to matter @xcite .",
    "we wish , however , to point out that some variants of our general model can also provide another way of fixing the end location of @xmath23 very near a particular value .",
    "indeed , if the kinetic function @xmath108 ( of the original @xmath23 variable ) happens to have a pole singularity @xmath247 with @xmath248 in the positive-@xmath161 domain the corresponding canonical field @xmath249 diverges when @xmath250 .",
    "therefore , if this pole singularity is in the way of the evolution of @xmath23 after the exit from _ k_-inflation ( e.g. , if @xmath251 in the case where @xmath252 ) , the typically large logarithmic drift of the canonical field @xmath229 during the first phase after exit , @xmath253 ( where @xmath254 denotes the beginning of radiation domination ) , will mean that the original field @xmath23 will end up very near @xmath255 .    evidently , this mechanism assumes that , except for @xmath108 , all the functions describing the coupling of @xmath23 to matter ( like the one giving the @xmath23-dependence of the gauge couplings ) are regular ( or , at least , less singular ) at @xmath256 .",
    "then , in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the observable coupling strength of @xmath23 to matter @xmath257 is driven near zero by our mechanism .",
    "we have pointed out that a general class of higher - order scalar kinetic terms @xmath258 can drive an inflationary evolution starting from rather arbitrary initial conditions . under not very restrictive conditions on the @xmath1-dependence of the kinetic term @xmath259 the early cosmological evolution",
    "will be attracted toward a slow - roll kinetically driven inflationary stage . in a large class of models",
    "this slow - roll behaviour has the following attractive features : ( i ) it drives the evolution from an initial high - curvature phase down to lower curvatures while dilating space in a quasi - exponential or power law manner , ( ii ) it is stable under ( high - frequency ) scalar perturbations , and ( iii ) it contains a natural exit mechanism because of the @xmath23-dependence of the kinetic terms .",
    "we have briefly discussed the exit of kinetically driven inflation and found that it seems to be naturally `` graceful '' in lending itself to a smooth transition toward a stage dominated by the radiation produced ( either through the @xmath23-dependence , or through purely gravitational effects ) at the end of slow - roll .",
    "we have also pointed out that the presence of pole - like singularities in the @xmath23-dependence of the kinetic terms can have some useful consequences : ( i ) a @xmath23-dependence of the form @xmath260 in the initial field domain can ensure a nearly constant speed of sound of order unity , while ( ii ) a pole - like singularity in the coefficient @xmath261 in the final field domain can help to fix the value of @xmath23 to a specific value .",
    "we leave to future work the investigation of general important issues : the choice of ( a measure on the ) initial conditions , and the computation of the perturbation spectra generated by this new type of inflation .",
    "we are aware that the compatibility of the latter issues with observations will probably necessitate the presence of some small ( or large ) dimensionless parameters in @xmath259 .    in this work",
    ", we have used the structure of the effective action in string theory as a partial motivation for considering higher - order kinetic terms @xmath259 .",
    "having found that such terms can generically drive an inflationary behaviour , we hope that our mechanism might be useful in suggesting new ways in which the dilaton and moduli fields of string theory might be compatible with inflation .",
