    "extragalactic tails and bridges are the best - known signatures of recent gravitational interactions between galaxies ( e.g. , toomre @xmath11 toomre 1972 ) .",
    "they are also often the birthsites of stars ( schweizer 1978 ; mirabel et al . 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "understanding when and how star formation is initiated in unusual environments such as tails and bridges can provide important clues to the processes governing star formation in general , while studying the properties of gas in tails and bridges may provide information about gas behavior during galaxy interactions and collisions .",
    "one poorly - understood factor in star formation initiation in tails and bridges is the amount and distribution of molecular gas .",
    "because molecular gas is the material out of which stars form , it is important to measure its distribution and mass in these structures , to test theories of how star formation is triggered in tails and bridges , and to understand gas phase changes during galaxy collisions and tail / bridge formation . in an earlier nrao 12 m telescope survey of tidal tails in six interacting / merging systems , we searched for co emission with no success ( smith @xmath11 higdon 1994 ) .",
    "co was also not found in the tail of the leo triplet galaxy ngc 3628 ( young et al .",
    "1983 ) , the tidal dwarf in the arp 105 system ( duc @xmath11 mirabel 1994 ; smith et al .",
    "1998 ) , or the hi - rich bridge of ngc 7714/5 ( struck et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the only locations where co has been found outside of the main disk of a galaxy is a small concentration ( @xmath110@xmath12 m@xmath7 ) of molecular gas near an extended arm in the m81 system ( brouillet et al .",
    "1992 ) and a larger mass ( 10@xmath13 m@xmath7 ) near the peculiar virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4438 ( combes et al .",
    "1988 ) . in the latter case , this gas is believed to have been removed from the disk by ram pressure stripping during a high velocity collision with its apparent companion , the s0 galaxy ngc 4435 ( kenney et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this paper , we present the first detection of a large quantity of molecular gas in an extragalactic tail , the eastern tail of the peculiar starburst galaxy ngc 2782 .",
    "the peculiar galaxy ngc 2782 ( figure 1 ) is an isolated galaxy with two prominent tails ( smith 1991 , 1994 ; sandage @xmath11 bedke 1994 ) .",
    "the longer western tail is rich in hi but faint in the optical , and the atomic gas extends well beyond the observed stars ( smith 1991 ; jogee et al .",
    "the eastern tail has a gas - deficient optical knot at the tip ( smith 1994 ) .",
    "the hi in this tail is concentrated at the base of the stellar tail ( smith 1994 ) .",
    "hii regions are visible in this location in the arp atlas ( 1966 ) photograph as well as the h@xmath9 map of evans et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and have been confirmed spectroscopically by yoshida , taniguchi , @xmath11 mirayama ( 1994 ) .    unlike most known double - tailed merger remnants ( e.g. , ngc 7252 ; schweizer 1982 ) , the main body of ngc 2782 has a exponential light distribution ( smith 1994 ; jogee et al .",
    "1999 ) , indicating that its disk survived the encounter that created the tails .",
    "the hi velocities of the ngc 2782 tails ( smith 1994 ) are opposite those expected from the h@xmath9 ( boer et al .",
    "1992 ) , hi ( smith 1994 ) , and co ( jogee et al . 1999 ) velocity fields of the galaxy core , indicating that the tails are probably in a different plane than the inner disk .",
    "the center of ngc 2782 contains a well - known nuclear starburst ( sakka et al .",
    "1973 ; balzano 1983 ; kinney et al .",
    "1984 ) , with an energetic outflow ( boer et al . 1992 ; jogee et al . 1998 ; yoshida et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the disk of ngc 2782 appears somewhat disturbed , with three prominent optical ` ripples ' ( arp 1966 ; smith 1994 ) , one of which contains bright h  ii regions ( hodge @xmath11 kennicutt 1983 ; smith 1994 ; evans et al . 1996 ;",
    "jogee et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the lack of an obvious companion galaxy to ngc 2782 ( smith 1991 ) , as well the presence of two oppositely directed tidal tails , suggests that it may be the remnant of a merger .",
    "the survival of the ngc 2782 disk , however , indicates that if it is a merger , the intruder was probably not of equal mass ( smith 1994 ) .",
    "it is possible that the optical concentration at the end of the eastern tail is the remains of a low mass companion , connected to the main galaxy by a stellar bridge .",
    "the presence of the ripples in the disk as well as the lack of hi at the tip of the eastern tail are consistent with the hypothesis that this companion passed through the disk of the main galaxy ( smith 1994 ) .",
    "the striking gas / star offset in this tail may be an example of the differing behaviour of gas and stars during a galaxy collision : the gas may have been left behind as the companion passed through the larger galaxy . in the longer western tail , in contrast to the eastern tail , the hi extends beyond the optical tail ( figure 1 ) . in the above collision scenario ,",
    "the longer western tail is material torn from the main galaxy s outer disk , which may have initially been more extended in gas than in stars .    in our previous co survey of tidal features",
    ", we searched for co in the longer western tail of ngc 2782 with no success ( smith @xmath11 higdon 1994 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present new co observations of the shorter eastern tail that reveal a large quantity of molecular gas in this feature .",
    "as noted above , this feature may be either a tail or a bridge plus companion , depending on how it formed .",
    "for convenience throughout this paper , we will simply refer to it as a tail .",
    "however , we note that it has some morphological differences from ` classical ' tidal tails ( e.g. , the antennae ) , in particular , the concentration of gas at the base of the stellar feature is unusual . throughout this paper , we assume a distance of 34 mpc ( h@xmath14 = 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) to ngc 2782 .",
    "ngc 2782 was observed in the co ( 1 @xmath0 0 ) line during 1996 december , 1997 april , may , and october , and 1998 october using the 3 mm sis receiver on the nrao 12 m telescope .",
    "two 256@xmath52 mhz filterbanks , one for each polarization , were used for these observations , providing a total bandpass of 1300 km s@xmath2 centered at 2555 km s@xmath2 with a spectral resolution of 5.2 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a nutating subreflector with a beam throw of 3@xmath15 was used , and each scan was 6 minutes long .",
    "the beamsize fwhm is 55@xmath16 at 115 ghz .",
    "the pointing was checked periodically with bright continuum sources and was consistent to 10@xmath16 .",
    "the system temperatures ranged from 300 to 400 k. calibration was accomplished using an ambient chopper wheel .",
    "we observed 17 positions in the ngc 2782 system .",
    "fifteen of these were arranged in a 5 @xmath5 3 grid at 25@xmath16 spacing .",
    "these include the center and 8 surrounding positions , as well as six positions in the eastern tidal tail .",
    "in addition , we re - observed the position in the western tidal tail previously observed by smith @xmath11 higdon ( 1994 ) and observed another position at the tip of the western tail . in figure 1 , these positions are marked on the hi and optical maps from smith ( 1994 ) and jogee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we have detected co emission at 14 of the 17 observed positions in ngc 2782 : the center , the surrounding positions , and five positions in the eastern tail .",
    "the sixth position in the eastern tail was not detected .",
    "the position in the western tail , previously observed but undetected by smith @xmath11 higdon ( 1994 ) , remains undetected .",
    "the position at the tip of the western tail was also undetected .",
    "the final summed scans are shown in figures 2 @xmath0 4 .",
    "integrated fluxes , rms noise levels , peak velocities , and line widths are provided in table 1 .",
    "for the first position in the western tail , the new data have been combined with the older data .",
    "note that the noise levels for the positions in the tails are considerably lower than for the other positions .",
    "the most striking result of our 12 m observations is the detection of co out in the eastern hi structure .",
    "the central velocities of the co lines in that tail and the narrow co line widths are consistent with those in hi ( smith 1991 , 1994 ) , showing that this molecular gas is associated with the tail rather than the main disk .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 5 , where velocity is plotted against right ascension for both the 21 cm hi data from smith ( 1994 ) and the new co data .",
    "the co and hi in the eastern tail are at a velocity of @xmath12620 km s@xmath2 , redshifted relative to the systemic velocity of 2555 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the hi in the western tail is blueshifted .",
    "both the co and hi gas in the disk , however , are blueshifted to the east of the nucleus and redshifted to the west of the nucleus .",
    "the molecular gas in the eastern tail , like the hi , shows a reversal in velocity , an apparent ` counter - rotation ' , with respect to the gas in the inner disk .",
    "as noted previously ( smith 1994 ) , the tails are probably not in the same plane as the disk so this may not represent a true counter - rotation in the same plane .    converting the co fluxes for this tail into molecular gas masses",
    "is very uncertain , because of possible metallicity and co self - shielding effects . in tidal features , where the column densities and metallicities tend to be low ,",
    "the galactic i@xmath4/n@xmath3 ratio may underestimate the amount of molecular gas ( smith @xmath11 higdon 1994 ) ( see section 7 ) .",
    "the gas in the eastern tail of ngc 2782 may be metal - poor ( yoshida et al .",
    "1994 ) , although this has not yet been quantified . using the galactic n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio for this tail may therefore underestimate the total amount of molecular gas present in it . for convenience in comparing with other galaxies and other tails / bridges , we will use this conversion factor ( 2.8 @xmath5 10@xmath17 @xmath18/(k km s@xmath2 ) ; bloemen et al .",
    "1986 ) , with the understanding that the h@xmath8 mass it provides may be a lower limit to the true molecular gas mass in this feature .",
    "possible variations to this conversion factor are discussed in detail in section 7 .    assuming the emission fills the beam ( coupling efficiency @xmath19@xmath20 = 0.82 )",
    ", the galactic conversion factor gives an average h@xmath8 column density for the five observed locations in the eastern tail of 2 @xmath5 10@xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "the co flux does not vary wildly from position to position in this tail , showing that molecular clouds are distributed throughout the feature , not concentrated in a single location . integrating over all five positions in the eastern tail",
    ", the galactic n@xmath3/i@xmath4 value gives a total molecular gas mass for this tail of 6 @xmath5 10@xmath6 m@xmath21 .",
    "this is the first detection of such a large quantity of molecular gas in a tail or bridge .",
    "this mass is two orders of magnitude higher than that in the possible m81 cloud ( brouillet et al . 1992 ) , and is similar to or greater than that found in irregular galaxies using the same conversion factor ( combes 1985 ; tacconi @xmath11 young 1987 ) .",
    "the molecular to atomic gas mass ratio for this tail is thus 0.6 .",
    "this is higher than the m@xmath3/m@xmath22 ratio derived for most dwarf irregular galaxies with the same conversion factor ( combes 1985 ; tacconi @xmath11 young 1987 ; israel , tacconi , @xmath11 baas 1995 ) .",
    "it is also higher than that found for scd and sm galaxies , but lower than the global values for earlier high mass spiral galaxies ( young @xmath11 knezek 1989 ) .",
    "this ratio is consistent with the value found in the outer regions of the milky way and other spiral galaxies , at galactic radii of 5 @xmath0 15 kpc ( bloemen et al .",
    "1986 ; tacconi @xmath11 young 1986 ; kenney , scoville , @xmath11 wilson 1991 ) .",
    "to investigate the processes that trigger star formation in tails and bridges , it is important to quantify the star formation rates , efficiencies , and morphologies in these structures . in figure 6 , we compare the hi structure of the eastern tail with the h@xmath9 map from jogee et al .",
    "this map shows at least nine h  ii regions in this tail ( table 2 ) .",
    "four of these were previously tabulated by evans et al .",
    "star formation is well - distributed throughout this feature , not concentrated in a single location . calibrating the h@xmath9 image using the total h@xmath9 flux for ngc 2782 from smith ( 1994 )",
    "gives a total h@xmath9 luminosity for this tail of 4.0 @xmath23 1.7 @xmath5 10@xmath24 l@xmath7 .",
    "this falls within the range spanned by irregular galaxies ( hunter @xmath11 gallagher 1985 ; hunter , hawley , @xmath11 gallagher 1993 ) , and is close to the observed l@xmath10 for well - known irregular galaxy ngc 6822 ( hunter et al .",
    "1993 ) . assuming an extended miller - scalo initial mass function ( kennicutt 1983 ) and no extinction correction",
    ", the total star formation rate for the eastern ngc 2782 tail is therefore between 0.01 and 0.05 m@xmath7 year@xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath9 luminosities for the observed h  ii regions in this tail range from 5 @xmath5 10@xmath25 erg s@xmath2 to 3 @xmath5 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath2 ( table 2 ) , with the more luminous regions being in the south .",
    "these luminosities are similar to those of the brightest h  ii regions in ngc 6822 ( hodge , lee , @xmath11 kennicutt 1989 ) , thus these h  ii regions are not extremely luminous , being more than an order of magnitude fainter than the 30 doradus h  ii region in the large magellanic cloud ( faulkner 1967 ; kennicutt 1984 ) .",
    "the ratio of the star formation rate to the available molecular gas for this feature , l@xmath10/m@xmath3 , is 0.002 l@xmath7/m@xmath7 .",
    "this is very low , compared to global values for high mass galaxies ( 0.001 @xmath0 1 l@xmath7/m@xmath7 , with the majority between 0.0025 and 0.1 l@xmath7/m@xmath7 ; young et al .",
    "this implies that the timescale for depletion of the available gas by star formation is very long , about 20 billion years .",
    "a greater - than - galactic n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio in the ngc 2782 tail would make these differences even more extreme .",
    "the h@xmath9/co ratio for this tail is also low compared to irregular galaxies . for eight irregular galaxies with co and h@xmath9 measurements available ( from tacconi @xmath11 young 1983 ; hunter @xmath11 gallagher 1996 ; hunter et al .",
    "1993 ; young et al . 1996 ; madden et al . 1997",
    "; israel 1997 ) , the l@xmath10/m@xmath3 ratios ( using the galactic conversion factor for comparison purposes ) range from @xmath270.01 to 1.9 , much higher than our value for the ngc 2782 eastern tail .",
    "therefore this tail has a very low star formation rate relative to its co flux , compared to global values for galaxies in general .",
    "in table 3 , we compare the hi and implied h@xmath8 column densities of the eastern ngc 2782 tail with five other extended features : the star - forming tail in the antennae galaxy ( ngc 4038/9 ) , the ngc 7714/5 bridge , the molecular gas concentration outside of the main disk of ngc 4438 , the magellanic irregular in the arp 105 system , and the northern tail of ngc 4676 ( the ` mice ' ) .",
    "we also include derived m@xmath3/m@xmath22 values in this table .",
    "as before , we are assuming the galactic n@xmath3/i@xmath4 conversion factor for convenience ; in section 7 , we discuss possible variations in this factor . for the star - forming antennae tail and",
    "the arp 105 irregular , the m@xmath3/m@xmath22 upper limits in the co beam are @xmath280.2 , much less than the detected level in the eastern ngc 2782 tail . in the bridge of the interacting pair",
    "ngc 7714/5 , the co / hi upper limit is even lower , implying m@xmath3/m@xmath22 @xmath28 0.06 . on the other hand , in the ngc 4438 source ,",
    "the co mass is large compared to the hi mass ( m@xmath3/m@xmath22 @xmath1 5 ) .",
    "thus there is a wide range in the co / hi ratios in these features . for ngc 4676 and the other tails measured but not detected in co ( young et al .",
    "1983 ; smith @xmath11 higdon 1994 ; duc @xmath11 mirabel 1994 ; duc et al .",
    "1997 ) , including our new measurements of the longer western tail of ngc 2782 , the hi column densities are less than that in the eastern ngc 2782 tail , and the derived m@xmath3/m@xmath22 upper limits in the co beam are similar to or higher than the ratio for the ngc 2782 eastern tail , so we are not able to make any strong comparisons .    in table 4",
    ", we compare the star forming properties of the eastern ngc 2782 tail with those of the other objects in table 3 . for the ngc 4438 feature , much of the ionized gas may have been ionized by shocks rather than young stars ( kenney et al .",
    "therefore , in table 4 we list the observed h@xmath9 luminosity as an upper limit to the h@xmath9 luminosity from young stars .",
    "arp 105 is not included in table 4 , although star formation is on - going in the arp 105 structure ( duc @xmath11 mirabel 1994 ) , because no global h@xmath9 flux has been published for this feature to date .",
    "the h@xmath9 luminosities are similar for the ngc 2782 tail , the ngc 7714/5 bridge , and the antennae tail and a few times larger for the ngc 4676 tail . for ngc 4438 ,",
    "the upper limit to l@xmath10 is similar to the measured values for the other systems .",
    "the co luminosity for the eastern ngc 2782 tail and the ngc 4438 clump are much higher than in the other systems , and therefore the implied l@xmath10/m@xmath3 ratios are much lower , if the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratios are similar",
    ". the l@xmath10/m@xmath3 ratio of ngc 2782 , and the upper limit for ngc 4438 , are more than 7 times lower than the lower limit for the antennae dwarf and 3 @xmath0 4 times lower than the lower limits for the ngc 7714/5 and ngc 4676 features .",
    "thus either the rate of star formation per molecular gas mass differs from system to system , being lowest in ngc 2782 and ngc 4438 , or the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratios are lower in ngc 2782 and ngc 4438 than in the other objects .",
    "these possibilities are discussed in sections 7 @xmath0 9",
    ".    we also note that the spatial distributions of the h  ii regions vary from feature to feature for the objects in table 4 , so the average ambient ultraviolet flux differs from object to object .",
    "the nine h  ii regions in the ngc 2782 tail are spread out over a total area of 60 kpc@xmath29 , while in the antennae , the three h  ii regions found by mirabel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) are located within a 10 kpc@xmath29 region . in the ngc",
    "7714/5 bridge , the area subtended by the star forming regions is @xmath136 kpc@xmath29 , while in the ngc 4676 tail , the h  ii regions in the 55@xmath16 ( 23 kpc ) co beam are aligned along a narrow ridge @xmath12 kpc or less in width ( hibbard 1995 ; hibbard @xmath11 van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "thus the ngc 2782 h  ii regions are more spread out than the hii regions in these other features , therefore the ambient uv field is weaker .",
    "the h@xmath9 luminosity functions also appear to differ from feature to feature .",
    "most of the observed h@xmath9 in the antennae dwarf is arising from a single luminous h  ii region of 1.4 @xmath5 10@xmath24 erg s@xmath2 ; the ngc 4676 tail contains several knots with similar luminosities ( hibbard 1995 ) .",
    "these h  ii regions are more luminous than any individual h  ii region in the ngc 2782 feature ( table 2 ) . in ngc 7714/5 , the three brightest h  ii regions in the bridge ( gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1995 ) are also more luminous than any in the ngc 2782 tail , but less luminous than the brightest in the antennae tail .",
    "in comparing the ngc 2782 tail to other features , we must first address the question of possible system - to - system differences in the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio .",
    "the parameters that may affect this ratio include the metallicity and dust content , the column and volume density , and the ambient ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "low dust extinction , as well as low c and o abundances , leads to more co destruction and therefore smaller co cores in low metallicity molecular clouds ( maloney @xmath11 black 1988 ; maloney 1990 ; maloney @xmath11 wolfire 1996 ) .",
    "co interferometric studies of nearby dwarf galaxies support this scenario ; the virial masses implied by the linewidths are often higher than h@xmath8 masses derived from co fluxes using the standard galactic conversion ratio ( dettmar @xmath11 heithausen 1989 ; rubio et al . 1991 , 1993a , b ; wilson 1994 , 1995 ; arimoto et al . 1996 ) .",
    "there is some suggestion that the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio in low metallicity systems scales with abundance , but with large scatter ( wilson 1995 ; arimoto et al . 1996 ) .",
    "one of the reasons for the observed system - to - system co / hi variations seen in table 3 may therefore be abundance variations . at this point , however , not enough information is available about these features to test this hypothesis .",
    "less - than - galactic oxygen abundances of 12 + log[o / h ] = 8.4 and 8.6 have been derived for the antennae and arp 105 features , respectively ( mirabel et al . 1992 ; duc @xmath11 mirabel 1994 ) .",
    "these are similar to the metallicity of the large magellanic cloud ( dufour 1994 ; russell @xmath11 dopita 1990 ) , and lower than the average value for the milky way ( 12 + log[o / h ] = 9.0 ; shaver et al .",

    "the column densities of the features in table 3 are in the range where the lack of co and possibly h@xmath8 self - shielding may be important .",
    "however , the co / hi ratio is not correlated with hi + h@xmath8 column density in this small sample . for the ngc 4438 , ngc 2782 , and antennae structures",

    ", it appears as if both the co and h@xmath8 thresholds are exceeded , and the co / hi ratio is very high . in the antennae galaxy , in contrast ,",
    "co ( and maybe h@xmath8 ) may not be well - shielded , and the co / hi ratio is very low .",
    "ngc 2782 lies between these two extremes .",
    "our detection of co in this tail implies that the co threshold is exceeded in at least portions of tail , but maybe not over the entire feature .",
    "ngc 7714/5 and arp 105 , however , do not fit this trend , while for ngc 4676 , the co / hi upper limit is too high to be able to make any strong constraints .",

    "perhaps this bridge has significantly lower abundances than the other features , and so a higher co self - shielding threshold .",
    "a related reason for the observed co / hi differences in table 3 may be variations in the clumpiness of the gas within the co beam . in ngc 4438 , the physical size of the co beam is only 2.2 kpc , 2.7 @xmath0 4.5 @xmath5 less than in the other systems , so a higher average h@xmath8 and co column density is not surprising . in arp 105 and ngc 4676 , the beamsizes are 30 kpc and 23 kpc , respectively , so lower average co column densities are also not unexpected . in the antennae and ngc 7714/5 features , however , the beam subtends 6 kpc and 10 kpc , respectively , compared to 9 kpc in ngc 2782 , yet the co is much fainter . thus there is no trend of decreasing co / hi ratio with beamsize . within the beam",
    ", however , there may be variations in how the gas is clumped ; perhaps in the ngc 2782 feature , the co self - shielding limit is exceeded over larger portions of the feature and so beam - dilution is less of a factor . this issue could be addressed with higher resolution co observations .    another important factor which affects",
    "the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio is the ambient ultraviolet flux , which may be higher in the antennae , ngc 4676 , and ngc 7714/5 features than in the eastern ngc 2782 tail ( see section 6 ) .",
    "if two systems have similar low metallicities , dust contents , and gas densities , the one with the more intense ambient ultraviolet field will have more co destruction and so a higher average n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio ( maloney @xmath11 wolfire 1996 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the difference between the co / hi ratios of the ngc 2782 tail and the other features .",
    "we conclude that system - to - system variations in the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio likely play an important role in determining the co / hi values of these features .",
    "however , without detailed analyses of the metal abundances in these structures we are not able to quantify these differences .",
    "another factor which may contribute to the observed variations in the co content of tails / bridges is differences in the formation mechanisms of these structures .",
    "two distinct processes contribute to the formation of extragalactic tails and bridges : tidal forces ( e.g. , toomre @xmath11 toomre 1972 ) and ram pressure stripping ( e.g. , spitzer @xmath11 baade 1951 ; struck 1997 ) .",
    "the relative importance of these two mechanisms probably varies from system to system : in small impact parameter collisions between gas - rich galaxies , cloud - cloud impacts and other hydrodynamical effects may be important in forming tails / bridges , while features pulled out during distant encounters may be largely tidal .",
    "dissipation in the gas , in addition to possible pre - collision differences in the gaseous and stellar distributions , may cause large offsets between the gas and the stars in bridges and tails .",
    "such offsets have been found in a number of systems ( wevers et al .",
    "1984 ; smith 1994 ; hibbard @xmath11 van gorkom 1996 ; smith et al .",
    "gas dissipation and shocks can occur both during the initial encounter and also during subsequent passages , as tails fall back into the main galaxies ( e.g. , hibbard and mihos 1995 ) .",
    "the six features in table 3 are quite different morphologically .",
    "the antennae and arp 105 structures are end - of - tail clumps ( van der hulst 1979 ; van der hulst et al . 1994 ; duc et al .",
    "1997 ) , while in ngc 4676 h  ii regions are seen along the full extent of the tail ( hibbard 1995 ; hibbard @xmath11 van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "the ngc 2782 gas is concentrated at the base of a stellar tail , the targeted region in ngc 7714/5 is in the middle of a bridge connecting two galaxies , and the molecular concentration near ngc 4438 lies out of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "ram pressure stripping may have played a bigger role in forming the eastern tail of ngc 2782 and the ngc 4438 clump than the other features .",
    "the ngc 2782 tail has a big gas / star offset , while in the antennae and ngc 4676 tails , the stars and gas are coincident ( van der hulst et al . 1994 ; hibbard @xmath11 van gorkom 1996 ) . in the arp 105 irregular ,",
    "the gas distribution is well - aligned with that of the stars , except for a slight offset at the southern end ( duc et al .",
    "the ngc 7714/5 bridge is actually two parallel bridges , one made out of stars , the other of gas , indicating that both tidal and hydrodynamical forces contributed to the formation of this feature ( smith et al .",
    "1997 ) . in ngc 4438 ,",
    "a distorted optical tail / arm lies 2 kpc away from the co concentration ( combes et al .",
    "1988 ) ; it is unclear whether the molecular gas is associated with this stellar structure or not ( kenney et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we have ordered these six features in terms of the importance of ram pressure stripping versus tidal forces in creating them .",
    "the ranking is : 1 ) ngc 4438 , 2 ) ngc 2782 , 3 ) ngc 7714/5 , 4 ) arp 105 , the antennae , and ngc 4676 .",
    "the antennae and ngc 4676 tails are classical tidal tails ( toomre @xmath11 toomre 1972 ; barnes 1988 ; mihos , bothun , @xmath11 richstone 1993 ) ; the arp 105 structure is also probably tidal ( duc et al . 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , the ngc 4438 clump is probably largely a product of ram pressure stripping ( kenney et al .",
    "the observed gas / star offsets in the ngc 2782 tail and ngc 7714/5 bridge suggest that gas dissipation played an important role in producing these features , but the existence of stellar counterparts shows that tidal forces also contributed ( smith 1994 ; smith et al . 1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , this splash / tidal ranking also correlates with the co / hi ratio in these systems . the two structures with the most pronounced gas / star morphological differences have the largest co abundances .",
    "one possible explanation for this correlation is simply a metallicity effect . in ngc 2782 and ngc 4438 , where ` splash ' probably played an important role and",
    "the impact parameters may have been smaller , the stripped gas , presumably removed from the inner disk , may be more metal - rich than material pulled from the outer disk in a grazing tidal interaction .",
    "therefore the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio may be lower than in the other systems .",
    "this possibility could be tested with detailed abundance studies .",
    "the observed large co fluxes from the ngc 4438 and ngc 2782 features might be considered somewhat surprising , in light of theoretical models of molecular dissociation during near head - on collisions . in fast shocks , h@xmath8 and",
    "co are dissociated ( e.g. , hollenbach @xmath11 mckee 1989 ) , so in an extreme ` splash ' , where high velocity cloud - cloud collisions occur , one may expect a large proportion of the molecular gas to be dissociated ( e.g. , harwit et al .",
    "direct evidence for strong shocks is present in the optical spectrum of the ngc 4438 co clump ( kenney et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the existence of co in the ngc 2782 and ngc 4438 features proves that , however they formed , the collisions / encounters were not drastic enough to dissociate all of the molecular gas , or , if the gas were indeed dissociated , sufficient time has passed for the h@xmath8 to reform .",
    "the molecule formation timescale is @xmath1 10@xmath13/n years/@xmath34 ( hollenbach @xmath11 mckee 1979 ) , so assuming the age of the ngc 2782 structure is @xmath1 2 @xmath5 10@xmath6 years ( smith 1994 ) , if the average density in this tail is n @xmath27 10 @xmath34 , as expected for molecular clouds , then it is quite possible that the molecules in this feature dissociated during the collision and now have reformed .",
    "one of the surprising results of this study is the low l@xmath10/m@xmath3 ratio for this ngc 2782 tail . whether or not star formation is triggered in a bridge or tail may be due in part to how much ram pressure stripping versus tidal effect occurred during the encounter . in a near - head - on encounter",
    ", one might expect more shocks and cloud fragmentation than in a more gentle tidal encounter .",
    "theoretical models suggest that star formation may be inhibited in ` splash ' features because of gas heating during the collision ( struck 1997 ) , while in tidal features gravitational compression may enhance star formation ( wallin 1990 ) .",
    "thus in ` splash ' features , molecular gas may be distributed in small , relatively diffuse clouds rather than concentrated in giant molecular clouds with high column densities .",
    "these theoretical results suggest a trend in the star formation rate per molecular gas mass with increasing tidal contribution , consistent with our results : the two most likely ` splash ' candidates have the lowest h@xmath9/co ratios in the group .",
    "a second possibility is that the gas surface density in the ngc 2782 tail may be below a critical surface density required for gravitational collapse , as has been surmised for the outer regions of galactic disks ( kennicutt 1989 ) . for a differentially rotating thin gas disk ,",
    "the critical surface density is @xmath35@xmath36 = @xmath37@xmath38@xmath39/3.36 g ( toomre 1964 ) , where @xmath37 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath38@xmath39 is the velocity dispersion , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "although a tail or bridge may not be directly participating in the overall rotation of a galaxy , we apply this argument by assuming that these structures are thin , and replacing @xmath37 by 2@xmath40v / r , twice the velocity gradient southwest to northeast along the long axis of the feature ( assuming the southeast to northwest shear in the tail is negligible ) .    in table 4",
    ", we have included hi velocity gradients and dispersions for the other features in our sample , as well as their expected critical surface densities . for ngc 4438 , the hi data from cayette et al .",
    "( 1990 ) are too low s / n to estimate the velocity gradient and dispersion accurately , so no critical density is derived .",
    "we note that the quoted velocity gradients are the observed gradients along the features , which do not take viewing perspective into account .",
    "therefore the derived critical densities are quite uncertain , perhaps by a factor of a few . within these uncertainties ,",
    "the critical densities of all the features are similar , and are similar to the observed gas column densities .",
    "for the eastern ngc 2782 tail , the observed n@xmath32 is indeed lower than the predicted critical density , suggesting that the gas in this feature may be relatively stable against gravitational collapse .",
    "in fact , the observed n@xmath32 for this tail is _",
    "greater _ than the expected self - shielding threshold for co and h@xmath8 , and yet _ less _ than the expected critical density for gravitational collapse .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of abundant co with relatively low h@xmath9 luminosity . in the ngc",
    "7714/5 bridge , the hi column density alone is so high that it approaches the critical density for gravitational instability .",
    "the huge mass of atomic gas in this bridge alone may be enough to ignite the formation of stars and enhance the efficiency of star formation .",
    "for ngc 4676 , the derived critical density is higher than the observed gas column density and for the antennae the critical and observed densities are similar , yet these galaxies have high l@xmath10/co ratios .",
    "this comparison suggests that in the ngc 4676 tail and perhaps in the antennae feature the beam filling factor may be low and/or the n@xmath3/i@xmath4 ratio may be higher compared to the ngc 2782 tail .",
    "using the nrao 12 m telescope , we have found evidence for 6 @xmath5 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 of molecular gas in the eastern tail of ngc 2782 . compared to both spiral and irregular galaxies ,",
    "the molecular gas content in the eastern tail of ngc 2782 is very high relative to the current rate of star formation , implying a very long timescale for gas depletion .",
    "both the molecular gas and h  ii regions in this feature are very extended , spread out over a total area of 60 kpc@xmath41 .",
    "comparison with tidal or ` splash ' regions in other galaxies shows a wide range in co / hi and h@xmath9/co values .",
    "we thank the telescope operators and the staff of the nrao 12 m telescope for their help in making these observations .",
    "we are pleased to acknowledge funding for this project from a nasa grant administered by the american astronomical society .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory under contract with nasa ."
