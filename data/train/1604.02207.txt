    "although the jets may also contain non - relativistic jet components , there is evidence that the relativistic component dominates and extends up to mpc  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the matter content of the relativistic jet remains uncertain , there are indications that protons dominate the mass flux even as electron - positron pairs dominate the particle flux in relativistic agn jets  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are considered the most likely driving mechanism on these scales as well  @xcite .    in any case , the acceleration mechanism is not well understood in jets , with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , @xcite demonstrated jet formation , based on the three - dimensional , general relativistic mhd simulations of rapidly rotating kerr black holes , and showed that jets may be able to reach up to a lorentz factor of 10 depending on the field geometry .    the intrinsic properties of extragalactic jets are difficult to measure , owing to the relativistic motion of the jet plasma , which can result in substantial time delays and doppler boosting in the observer s frame .",
    "time delays strongly affect optically thin emission along a given path through the jet , and doppler boosting couples the true physical properties of the emitting material to the geometrical and kinematic conditions in the flow .",
    "we would like to derive the evolution of some intrinsic parameters of the flow which can be used as a probe of the acceleration .",
    "brightness temperature measurements of vlbi cores as derived from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) are such a probe .",
    "it brings us the closest to the central engine , reduces the effect of time delays ( important for the optically thin part of the flow ) , and also reduces the chance of contaminating our measurements due to variable doppler boosting in a ( likely ) curved flow downstream of the core .",

    "as shown in @xcite , the brightness temperatures of the vlbi cores imaged at 86  ghz are found to be lower than those at 15  ghz , assuming the brightness temperature on average is the same for all sources , and the viewing angles of the target jets are close to the critical value for the maximal apparent jet speed , following @xcite .",
    "careful comparison of the brightness temperatures at multifrequencies , that is , at 2 , 8 , 15 , and 86  ghz enabled the study of the variation of the brightness temperatures as a function of frequency .",

    "[ table : tbstat ] , we quantify this result , where we show for each frequency the median , mean and standard deviation ( rms ) value of the brightness temperature . from the table",
    "it is seen that the median and mean of the 86  ghz brightness temperatures are lower by a factor of 5 - 6 compared to those of lower frequency brightness temperatures . despite the uncertainties due to the amplitude calibration error of @xmath76 at 86  ghz  @xcite and the source variability of a factor of @xmath77 , the brightness temperatures observed at 86  ghz are still relatively lower than those at the lower frequencies , implying that the decrease of brightness temperatures at 86  ghz is significant .",
    "the variation of brightness temperature with frequency can be translated into a variation of brightness temperature as a function of core separation assuming the validity of the relativistic jet model , as in particular using equation  ( [ eqn : r ] ) . with the reasonable assumption of @xmath64 , @xmath65",
    ", we obtain @xmath78 , and therefore @xmath79 .",

    "this may at least partly explain the relatively large scatter of brightness temperature in figure  [ fig1 ] , which indeed is based on many sources with different synchrotron luminosity ( see table  [ table : lsyn ] ) .",
    "another reason for the scatter may also come from source intrinsic deviations from the idealized power law indices @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which may be slightly different for individual sources . since the particle energy and magnetic field energy densities at 1pc , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are different from source to source , and usually unknown , one can not easily determine the absolute position of the core from equation  ( [ eqn : r ] ) except for the case when the apparent shift of the core position at several frequencies is measured  @xcite .",
    "however , with the assumption of energy equipartition between particle and fields in a relaxed and steady jet , the core position can be predicted with the known synchrotron luminosity  @xmath70 using equation  ( [ eqn : r2 ] ) .",
    "the synchrotron luminosity can be estimated from the core flux measurements of each source over the range of rest frame frequencies , @xmath84 .",
    "fitting the spectrum of the core gives the total flux of the source over the range of frequencies .",
    "then , the synchrotron luminosity @xmath70 can be estimated taking into account the total flux and luminosity distance of each source . in table  [ table : lsyn ] we summarize the estimated synchrotron luminosity , which is used together with equation  ( [ eqn : r2 ] ) to drive the core separation .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the brightness temperatures as a function of the determined core position for all compact jets selected . as described in section  [ general ] , all sources are assumed to have the same lorentz factor @xmath85 , jet opening angle @xmath86 , and viewing angle @xmath87 .",
    "the electron density at 1pc is @xmath88 .",
    "the synchrotron emission is assumed to be emitted from the region with the scale factor of @xmath89 at frequencies of @xmath90 . after investigating the change of results depending on @xmath91",
    ", we found that the distance @xmath27 of a core observed at a given frequency mildly depends on @xmath91 , as @xmath92 , yielding , for example , the ranges of @xmath93  pc for @xmath94 and of @xmath95  pc for @xmath96 .",
    "as expected from figure  [ fig1 ] , the brightness temperatures increase from the inner region to the outer region of ( sub-)parsec scales , which implies that the energy of the radiating particles increases as they are driven out from the central engine in the ( sub-)parsec scale region of the jet .",
    "in order to interpret the increase of the brightness temperatures along the jet on the scales of 0.01 - 100  pc , we modeled it with a single power - law function as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "one single power - law seems to reasonably fit the data , but in particular on sub - pc scales , a number of data points fall below the best fit line .",
    "this may imply that a single power - law fit may not be the best presentation of the radial dependence of brightness temperature .",
    "although the number of data points in each bin of the distance ( e.g. , 0.01 - 0.1  pc , 0.1 - 1  pc , 1 - 10  pc and 10 - 100  pc ) is different each other , the increasing pattern in the inner region ( e.g. , 0.01 - 0.1  pc ) looks a bit different from those in the outer region ( 0.1 - 10  pc ) .",
    "moreover the large scatter of data in 1 - 100  pc may make difficult to find an increasing trend .",
    "therefore , we tried to fit the data with multiple power - law functions on restricted ranges of the distance ( 0.01 - 0.1pc , 0.1 - 10pc , and 3 - 100pc ) .",
    "we found that the power index of the best fit function ranged from 0.06 to 0.8 , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the multiple power - law functions indeed reveal the slow increasing trends of the brightness temperature in the regions of 0.01 - 0.1  pc and 3 - 100  pc , yielding power indices of 0.06 and 0.11 , respectively .",
    "therefore we concluded that the brightness temperature increases with different slopes ( or power indices ) in different regions for our data . here",
    "caution should be taken for the fit results on the 0.01 - 0.1  pc regions , since there are only three data points ( although those are all data we have for the region ) .",
    "this result stimulated us to developing a single function suitable to model the overall evolution of the brightness temperatures along the jet .",
    "one of the best empirical models which we found has the following form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 are the minimum ( or initial ) and maximum brightness temperatures in k , respectively , and @xmath27 is the distance of the vlbi core components from the central engine in pc .",
    "this model assumes that @xmath98 is the brightness temperature near the jet base and @xmath99 that in the downstream of the jet .",
    "we used @xmath100  k which is corresponding to the mean of the observed brightness temperatures at @xmath101  pc in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the best fitting was obtained for @xmath102  k and @xmath103 , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "this implies that the brightness temperatures on sub - parsec scales are close to or even below the equipartition temperature of @xmath104  k ( indicating that the jets may be magnetically dominated ) and start to increase on ( sub-)parsec regions , reaching the inverse compton limit of @xmath105  k on parsec scales .",
    "based on this best fitting model , we now can discuss specific jet parameters , like the the doppler - factor and lorentz factor .",
    "this is done in the next two sections .",
    "one of the possible and very simple ways to understand the variation of the brightness temperatures as a function of the distance is to assume that all of the observed variation in brightness temperatures is caused by a variation of the doppler factor .",
    "since the compact radio jets are highly relativistic , their synchrotron emission is doppler boosted and the boosting effect is parametrized by the doppler factor . the doppler factor is related to the physical properties of the relativistic jets such as the lorentz factor @xmath91 , the intrinsic brightness temperature @xmath98 , and the jet viewing angle @xmath106 : @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the speed of the jet in the rest frame of the source in units of @xmath110 .    in order to derive the evolution of the doppler factor as a function of the distance @xmath27 , equation  ( [ eqn : doppler - tb ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the doppler factor at @xmath113 . from equations  ( [ eqn : model ] ) and ( [ eqn : doppler - tb ] ) ,",
    "the doppler factor @xmath114 can be derived as @xmath115,\\ ] ] where we assume that the minimum ( or initial ) brightness temperature in the model ( equation  ( [ eqn : model ] ) ) is equal to the intrinsic brightness temperature . with this assumption ,",
    "the inferred doppler factor increases from @xmath116 to @xmath117 in a similar way as the brightness temperature does , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the maximum doppler factor @xmath118 constrains viewing angle @xmath106 in deducing the lorentz factor as a function of the distance from the central engine , as below .",
    "one of the intrinsic properties of the relativistic jets , the lorentz factor , can be deduced from equation  ( [ eqn : doppler ] ) which , can be rewritten as @xmath119 for @xmath54 and @xmath106 satisfying the condition @xmath120 , a physically permitted solution of equation  ( [ eqn : gamma1 ] ) is @xmath121 by inserting equation  ( [ eqn : doppler - r ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : gamma2 ] ) , the dependence of the lorentz factor on the distance from the central engine @xmath122 is deduced as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( middle panel ) , and according to the definition @xmath109 the evolution of the jet speed @xmath123 is directly deduced as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] ( bottom panel ) . here it should be noted that @xmath124 .",
    "thus three examples of @xmath91 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are shown .",
    "this picture matches very well with similar acceleration plots given for the magnetically driven , accelerating jet model  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that in the sub - parsec scale the mass flux is initially constant and then increasing , and in the outer region the mass flux becomes constant again .",
    "the lorentz factor also shows a similar trend , being constant in the inner region and then increasing in the outer region .",
    "as the mass flux gets constant , the lorentz factor also becomes constant in the outer region .",
    "we like to emphasize that such acceleration from sub - pc to pc - scales has been reported in a number of cases , such as ngc  6251  @xcite with moderately relativistic speeds ( @xmath128 ) , cygnus  a  @xcite for apparent relativistic speeds ( @xmath129 ) , ngc  315  @xcite for parsec - scale jet acceleration ( @xmath130 ) , m  87  @xcite for jet acceleration from non - relativistic ( @xmath131 ) to relativistic ( @xmath132 ) , and 3c345  @xcite for highly relativistic speeds ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the increase of core brightness temperature with decreasing frequency could also be at least partly due to an instrumental beam blending effect , with a larger observing beam size at lower frequencies .",
    "therefore the fitted core region may be dilluted by jet emission , which comes from regions downstream of the @xmath134 surface  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this blending effect will be more pronounced at the lower frequencies ( 2 , 8 , 15 ghz ) , because of the larger beam sizes .",
    "the brightness temperature measurements at 2.3  ghz and 8.6  ghz are based on @xcite . using a part of the database",
    ", @xcite analyzed opacity effect ( or core - shift effect ) on the vlbi core measurements .",
    "they found that the median of the measured core shift between 2.3  ghz and 8.6  ghz is 0.44 mas with its maximum of 1.4 mas .",
    "they discussed the blending effect of the core and optically thin jet on the core shift measurements .",
    "they found that the blending shift of the core position has a distribution with its median value of 0.006 mas ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "based on this study we may be able to estimate the blending effect on the core flux measurement .",
    "@xcite found that the vlbi cores fitted with the circular gaussian model had median values of their sizes of 1.04 mas and 0.28 mas at 2.3  ghz and 8.6  ghz , respectively .",
    "these results , in addition to the median value of core - shift of 0.44 mas , lead to a simple conical geometry of a jet as @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) , where @xmath10 is the jet size and @xmath27 is the distance from the jet base , assuming @xmath137 .",
    "here , we may assume that the blending effect of 0.006  mas obtained from the 8.6  ghz data is similar to that for the 2.3  ghz data .",
    "then the true position of the 2.3  ghz vlbi core , if it is observed with the beam of 8.6 ghz , would be shifted by 0.006  mas to the jet base , compared with the observed position of the 2.3  ghz vlbi core . according to the simple jet geometry ,",
    "the true ( or blending - free ) size of the core may decrease by @xmath138  mas = 0.01  mas which is @xmath139 of its size of 1.04 mas obtained with the model fitting .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath134 surface of the core has uniform brightness then the flux density of the true core may decrease by @xmath140 .",
    "this implies that the blending effect to the core flux density measurement may not be significant for the 2.3  ghz data with respect to the 8.6  ghz data .",
    "we can also estimate the effect between the 8  ghz data and the 86  ghz data .",
    "@xcite also predicted that the expected core shift between 8.6  ghz and an optical wavelength of 6000 angstrom would reach 0.12  mas which may be considered as the upper limit of the core shift between 8.6  ghz and 86  ghz  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the 86  ghz vlbi cores fitted with the circular gaussian model had median sizes of @xmath1410.04 mas .",
    "these results again lead to a simple conical geometry of a jet as @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "if we assume that the core blending effect to the core shift is proportional to the frequency difference ( or resolution difference ) , then the blending effect would be as large as @xmath1410.016  mas ( @xmath144  mas ) on the 8.6  ghz data with respect to the 86 ghz data . as a result , the true size of the 8.6  ghz core may decrease by @xmath145  mas@xmath146  mas which is @xmath147 of the core size of 0.24 mas as obtained at 8.6  ghz with model fitting .",
    "based on the constant brightness distribution of the @xmath134 surface of the core at 8  ghz , the flux density @xmath148 of the true core may decrease by @xmath149 .",
    "then , we can estimate the fractional error ( or blending effect ) on the brightness temperature @xmath7 using gaussian error propagation as @xmath150",
    ". the effect may be significant but is still small compared to the observed difference in the brightness temperature between 8.6  ghz and 86  ghz of a factor of 5 - 6 ( see table  [ table : tbstat ] ) .",
    "due to the highly relativistic physical environments , the compact jets of extragalactic radio sources are doppler boosted , making it impossible to directly measure their intrinsic properties : the intrinsic brightness temperature , the lorentz factor , and the viewing angle . under the equipartition condition between the magnetic field energy and particle energy density , the absolute distance of the vlbi core can be predicted , based on the facts that ( a ) the vlbi cores of the compact radio sources are optically thick at a given frequency , and ( b ) the distance of the core from the central engine is inversely proportional to the frequency .",
    "the multifrequency large vlbi surveys of the compact radio jets allowed the investigation of the source - frame brightness temperatures of the ( sub-)parsec regions of the relativistic jets , yielding the following findings :    1 .    from the vicinity of the central engine to the outer region of the relativistic jets on ( sub-)parsec scales , the brightness temperatures increase , implying that the energy of the radiating particles increases as they are driven out from the central engine in the ( sub-)parsec scale regions .",
    "2 .    the evolution of the brightness temperatures on the ( sub-)parsec scales can be modeled , indicating that the brightness temperatures on sub - parsec scales are close to or even below the equipartition temperature of @xmath104  k and start to increase on ( sub-)parsec regions , reaching the inverse compton limit of @xmath105  k on parsec scales .",
    "the evolution of the brightness temperatures directly reveals the dependence of the jet properties  the doppler factor , the lorentz factor , and the jet speed  on the distance from the central engine on ( sub-)parsec scales , suggesting that the relativistic jets are magnetically driven to accelerate on the ( sub-)parsec scale and travel at a constant speed on the parsec scales .",

    "<S> jets of compact radio sources are highly relativistic and doppler boosted , making studies of their intrinsic properties difficult . observed brightness temperatures can be used to study the intrinsic physical properties of the relativistic jets , and constrain models of jet formation in the inner jet region . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to observationally test such inner jet models . </S>",
    "<S> the very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) cores of compact radio sources are optically thick at a given frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the distance of the core from the central engine is inversely proportional to the frequency . under the equipartition condition between the magnetic field energy and particle energy densities , </S>",
    "<S> the absolute distance of the vlbi core can be predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we compiled the brightness temperatures of vlbi cores at various radio frequencies of 2 , 8 , 15 , and 86  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the brightness temperature on sub - parsec scales in the rest frame of the compact radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the brightness temperature increases with increasing distance from the central engine , indicating that the intrinsic jet speed ( the lorentz - factor ) increases along the jet . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the jets are accelerated in the ( sub-)parsec regions from the central engine . </S>"
