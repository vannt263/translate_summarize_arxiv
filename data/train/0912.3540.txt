    "in the current cold dark matter cosmology , the favorably accepted galaxy formation paradigm is that galaxies like the milky way were assembled from a series of accretion events involving lower mass subunits , in a fashion similar to galaxy cluster formation  @xcite . if these favored hierarchical models are correct , then the stellar halo of the galaxy should form through tidal disruption and accretion of numerous low - mass fragments such as dwarf satellite galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these merging events may leave traces of large - scale stellar substructures in the outer galactic halo , and remnant stellar systems of the parent fragments with a long dynamical disruption time scale .    since the classical  @xcite scenario of the formation of the galaxy",
    "was first suggested , there has been more observational evidence to support the accretion scenario that the halo population of the milky way and globular clusters originated through the gradual merging and disruption of fragments .",
    "this evidence includes ( 1 ) a large - scale stellar substructure through the galactic halo , ( 2 ) a feature of multiple populations in a globular cluster that is indicative of the remnant nuclei of a merged dwarf spheroidal galaxy , ( 3 ) an extended tidal feature in a spatial stellar density distribution , such as tidal tails and halos around a globular cluster , which might trace the cluster s orbit , and ( 4 ) a spatially aligned configuration of a group of several globular clusters .",
    "consequently , globular clusters in the galactic halo and their surroundings , as the local manifestations of the hierarchical galaxy formation , are the best places to look for the substructure of stellar distribution in the galactic outer halo .",
    "for the first note of large - scale stellar substructures through the galactic halo ,  @xcite indicated that several dwarf spheroidal galaxies and outer halo clusters lie near two great circles passing close to the galactic poles , i.e. , the magellanic stream and the fornax - leo - sculptor stream .",
    "the spatially associated distribution of dwarf galaxies is interpreted as a result of the accretion of parent satellite galaxies which are considered the external fragments .",
    "furthermore , recent large - scale surveys have uncovered several complex substructures of the stellar galactic halo  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the most striking example in this category is the discovery of the trails of stellar debris associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy  @xcite .",
    "stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that the brightest globular clusters in the galaxy are actually the remnant nuclei of dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "indeed ,  @xcite detected multiple stellar populations of different age and metallicity in @xmath4 centauri , the most massive globular cluster in the galaxy .",
    "this is reminiscent of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which includes m54 as its nucleus , the second most massive globular cluster in the galaxy . extending previous suggestions ,",
    "@xcite suggested that the majority of metal - poor young globular clusters in the outer halo originated from dwarf spheroidal galaxies , and it would be worthwhile to find their parent galaxies .",
    "recently ,  @xcite found that globular clusters with an extended horizontal - branch ( ehb ) would be kinematically decoupled from the normal clusters , and , that these are the relics of the first building blocks of the galaxy formation .",
    "if present galactic globular clusters formed within larger stellar systems , they are likely surrounded by extratidal halos and tails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems . also , they would have lost the majority fraction of the initial mass due to their internal and external dynamical effects , such as tidal heating and stripping  @xcite .",
    "this information suggests that surroundings around globular clusters provide an excellent example of such a structure , and as a result we might expect to figure out them by wide - field deep photometry  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the first attempt to find such a tidal feature around globular clusters ,  @xcite examined the stellar density distribution around 12 globular clusters and found that many globular clusters have surface density profiles significantly exceeding the prediction of formal king models and also extending outside the tidal radius by extratidal stars .",
    "until now , signatures of the extratidal overdensity feature have been found in over 30 globular clusters both in the galaxy and in m31  @xcite .",
    "recent star count surveys have revealed tidal structures stretching many degrees beyond the cluster tidal radius , for which the most spectacular examples include palomar 5  @xcite and ngc 5466  @xcite with tails extending as much as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . as a consequence of these previous studies",
    ", it has been apparent that tidal tails of globular clusters are likely aligned with the cluster s orbit because the debris produced by a dissolving globular cluster will have similar orbital parameters as the cluster itself .",
    "recently ,  @xcite presented kinematics of debris around palomar 5 to suggest that the cluster s orbit in the sky is not exactly aligned with its tidal tails . here",
    ", we also note that  @xcite found that the luminosity function ( lf ) in the tails of palomar 5 agrees well with the lf in the outer region of the cluster but differs from the lf in the cluster s core . on the theoretical side",
    ", many numerical simulations have reproduced a structure of tidal tails around globular clusters  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the cluster - galaxy interaction can cause stars to escape the cluster s gravitational potential , and then the unbounded stars remain in the vicinity of the cluster for several orbital periods to become tidal debris - forming tails in front of and behind the cluster s orbit  @xcite",
    ".    the spatial alignment of the globular cluster system might also play an important role in untangling the possibility that the galactic halo may have formed from the accretion of dwarf galaxies . for a statistically significant instance",
    ", the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal has its own globular cluster system associated with several halo clusters beyond a galactocentric distance @xmath7 kpc  @xcite .",
    "this attests to the fact that even minor mergers play a key role in the formation and structure of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore ,  @xcite found that a group of the seven lowest metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -2.0 ) clusters ( i.e. , ngc 5053 , ngc 5466 , m15 , m30 , m53 , m68 , and m92 , classified as oosterhoff group ii - b ) displays a planer alignment in the outer halo perpendicular to the line joining the present position of the sun and the galactic center .",
    "they also suggested that these metal - poor clusters were originally born in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and have recently been captured by the galaxy through the magellanic plane .",
    "indeed , the configuration of the milky way with the stream of clusters and satellites in the magellanic plane closely resembles the stellar stream in the halo of m31 , which lies along the satellites m32 and ngc 205  @xcite .",
    "of the seven low - metallicity clusters in the magellanic plane  @xcite , ngc 5466 has been the subject of extensive investigations from wide - field photometric analyses of the sdss data  @xcite to show a feature of extended extratidal tails outside the tidal radius along the cluster s orbit .",
    "the other clusters in the magellanic plane have not yet shown any strong observational evidences of extratidal tails along the clusters orbits . instead ,",
    "hints of a weak evidence of extratidal halo structure outside the tidal radius have been reported for three clusters , i.e. , m15  @xcite , m68  @xcite , and m92  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the two - dimensional distribution of stars around five clusters ( m15 , m30 , m53 , ngc 5053 , and ngc 5466 ) of the seven extreme metal - poor globular clusters of the oosterhoof group ii - b  @xcite and we report the spatial structure of the stellar distribution in the vicinity of the clusters .",
    "wide - field @xmath0 imaging photometric data for the five globular clusters have been secured from the observations of the megacam attached to the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "table  [ posi ] contains basic data for the five target globular clusters .",
    "note that the other two low - metallicity clusters m68 and m92 have not been observed at the present observing runs .",
    "section 2 presents the observations , data reduction procedure , and photometric measurements of the resolved stars .",
    "the statistical mask filtering method for the photometric selection of clusters member stars is presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we investigate extratidal features around the target clusters by using two - dimensional stellar density maps , radial surface density profiles , and azimuthal number density profiles .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in section 5 .",
    "the wide - field photometric imaging data for m15 , m30 , m53 , ngc 5053 , and ngc 5466 were taken in queued service observing ( qso ) of the 3.6 m cfht .",
    "the detector in the megacam is a mosaic of thirty - six @xmath9 pixels@xmath10 ccds , that together cover an area of @xmath11 wide - field - of - view with a plate scale of @xmath12 pixel@xmath13 .",
    "we covered nine and eight megacam observing fields for the surroundings of two clusters , m15 and ngc 5466 , and of one cluster , m30 , respectively . for each cluster ,",
    "one field was centered to imbed the cluster itself , while the other fields outside the object were chosen so as to cover a total field of view of @xmath14 .",
    "since the tidal radii of the clusters are in the range of @xmath15 @xmath16 , a set of these observations provided sufficiently large spatial coverage for our purpose of studying the stellar density distribution and tidal features in the vicinity of the globular clusters .",
    "the other two clusters , m53 and ngc 5053 , compose a close neighbor pairing system with an angular separation of @xmath17 on the sky , and the two clusters have nearly the same distance modulus .",
    "note that the close proximity of the two clusters is very unusual in the outer halo of the galaxy . in order to search for direct observational evidence of a tidal interaction between the two clusters and tidal features around each cluster ,",
    "we observed nine megacam fields in a pattern as shown in figure  [ obs ] , covering both of the clusters .",
    "the imaging data for the target clusters were taken in three sdss filters , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "single exposures were taken for each filter without a dither pattern .",
    "the exposure times to be used were determined so as to achieve a limiting magnitude of @xmath21 magnitudes below the main sequence turnoff of each cluster , i.e. , @xmath22 mag .",
    "table  [ log ] presents the journal of the observations .",
    "stars have @xmath23 arcsec fwhm in the final processed images , depending on the filter .",
    "the removal of instrumental signatures from the raw images was done with the elixir processing pipeline at the cfht  @xcite .",
    "this processing includes bias subtraction , flat fielding , and the subtraction of a fringe frame . also , the pre - analysis of the elixir produced 36 ccd images of a given mosaic with the same zeropoint and magnitude scale .",
    "a typical value of the residuals across a mosaic is @xmath24 mag .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting programs daophot ii and allstar  @xcite .",
    "analysis was done on a single - chip basis for all exposures of the 36 ccd chips on the mosaic .",
    "a psf varying quadratically through positions was constructed using @xmath25 bright and isolated stars for a heavily crowded image and @xmath26 stars for a less crowded image .",
    "the quality of each psf has been improved by removing neighboring stars around selected psf stars and reconstructing the psf iteratively .",
    "instrumental magnitudes for each star based on the determined psf were then measured by the allstar process .",
    "aperture correction was applied by using the growth - curve analysis package daogrow  @xcite to compensate for the missing light lying outside of the psf tail for every star in each frame .",
    "after the aperture correction , daomatch and daomaster  @xcite were used to match stars on each ccd chip , and coordinate offsets for each field were estimated from the positional data in each frame .",
    "we then converted all the positional data of each chip on a mosaic into a single coordinate system .",
    "finally , the positional data for stars in the observed megacam fields were transformed into the equatorial coordinate system , by using the usno - b catalog  @xcite for bright stars in the fields .",
    "the measured instrumental magnitudes were photometrically calibrated using the zeropoints that were computed from standard star observations during each megacam run .",
    "the calibrated magnitudes were finally converted into a standard sdss photometric system , as defined by  @xcite .",
    "individual stars with poorly determined photometric measurements , as reported by allstar , were removed to limit the number of spurious detections for each cluster .",
    "objects with @xmath27 and sharp values that markedly deviated from the values for the majority of objects were rejected , and this removed objects near the faint limit of the data and extended objects such as faint galaxies . in order to correct the interstellar extinction , we derived the individual extinction value for each detected star from the maps of  @xcite , and these values have been subtracted from the observed magnitude .",
    "finally a total of 239 600 , 100 069 , and 69 901 stars were detected for each @xmath28 field of clusters m15 , m30 , and ngc 5466 , respectively . for nine megacam fields of m53 and ngc 5053 ,",
    "we detected 79 075 stars in all three @xmath0 images .",
    "a feature of spatial stellar distribution around globular clusters represents the sum of the unbound stars released by the cluster and the field stars .",
    "therefore , to trace the overdensity features around the clusters in detail , one needs to minimize the number of contaminating field stars in a given sample and to enhance the contrast between the cluster and the field . in the first statistical attempt to discriminate field stars",
    ",  @xcite introduced a polygonal mask method in a color - magnitude ( c - m ) space in which only field stars with colors and magnitudes that resemble those of cluster stars are counted to optimize the ratio of the cluster stars to field stars .",
    "however , the defined mask in a c - m space does not provide the optimal method to map the spatial stellar distribution around sparsely populated globular clusters because many bins with a small number of stars in a c - m space can be statistically excluded from the mask . to reduce the disadvantage of poor statistics",
    ",  @xcite introduced a new method to compress the photometric data in a c - m space by constructing new color indices from which the weighted sum of field stars plus cluster stars yields the best approximation of the observed total c - m distribution . in the present study",
    ", we have applied the same method of  @xcite to define a c - m mask with new color indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath0 magnitudes for detected stars in the vicinity of each cluster .",
    "first , we defined two orthogonal color indicies @xmath29 and @xmath30 from a linear distribution of stars in a ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) color - color diagram . indeed",
    ", the choice of the indicies is such that the main axis of the almost one - dimensional locus of cluster stars in the color - color plane lies along the @xmath29 axis , while the @xmath30 axis is perpendicular to it  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equation  ( [ eq : rela1 ] ) presents general forms of the rotational transformation of the ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) plane to the coordinate system of ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) . here , the systematic variation of color with magnitude is mostly contained in @xmath29 , while variations in @xmath30 are mostly due to the observational photometric errors , as noted in  @xcite .",
    "transformation coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 for each cluster were determined by using the least - squared fit to the data , which are listed in table 3 .",
    "assuming that two clusters m53 and ngc 5053 have very similar color - magnitude diagrams(cmds ) with almost identical metallicity and age  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and nearly the same distance modulus , we estimated a set of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for all stars detected in both of the clusters .",
    "@xmath37    in ( @xmath38 ) space of stars located in the central region of the clusters , we preselected the sample in @xmath30 by discarding all stars with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the photometric errors in @xmath30 for stars with magnitude @xmath20 .",
    "the radii of the cluster s central regions were empirically defined in the unit of half - mass radius ( @xmath41 ) or core radius ( @xmath42 ) of the cluster in order to find appropriate color - magnitude sequences of stars in each cluster .",
    "the heavy lines in the leftmost panels in figure 2 give @xmath43 limits for stars in each cluster . for a system of m53 and ngc 5053 , we selected a central region of the clusters as the sum of @xmath44 for m53 and @xmath45 for ngc 5053 .    for stars preselected in the @xmath46 plane",
    ", we then applied the c - m mask filtering method  @xcite in the @xmath47 plane , from which we eventually extracted a sample of stars to trace their spatial configuration around the clusters .",
    "we first examined the distribution of the cluster population in the @xmath47 space by means of preselected stars in the cluster central area and the background field areas .",
    "the cluster central area was assigned so as to have the largest number ratio of stars enclosed @xmath48 and those outside @xmath48 in the @xmath47 plane for all preselected stars within the radius of the circle .",
    "here , @xmath49 is an estimated standard deviation of @xmath20 magnitudes of stars at @xmath29 .",
    "the second from the left panels in figure  [ cmd1 ] show @xmath47 cmds of stars within the radii of the determined central areas of the clusters , which are denoted by circles centered on each cluster in figure  [ select ] .",
    "we also selected four background field areas in circles at sufficiently distant parts from the cluster .",
    "for three isolated target clusters , m15 , m30 , and ngc 5466 , the sum of the background field areas is nine times those of the determined cluster s area , as shown in figure  [ select ] .",
    "note that , as shown in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ select ] , the background areas for a field of m53 and ngc 5053 were empirically selected to have a total area five times larger than the sum of central areas of the two clusters .",
    "the third and forth panels of figure  [ cmd1 ] , from left to right , show the @xmath47 cmds of the stars in the selective background regions and in the total survey region for each cluster , respectively .",
    "next , we compared the ( @xmath29,@xmath50 ) cmd of stars in the selective cluster central region with that of stars in the assigned background regions , from which we select areas in the ( @xmath29,@xmath50 ) plane with high significance about the expected true number of cluster stars .",
    "this procedure was done by subdividing the c - m plane into small subgrid elements with a 0.025-mag width in @xmath29 and a 0.12-mag height in @xmath50 .",
    "then , we measured the number of stars in each subgrid element of cluster area @xmath51 and those of background fields @xmath52 , for which we assumed that the distribution of background field stars on the c - m plane does not vary across the observed field .",
    "the local signal - to - noise ratio @xmath53 in each subgrid element was then calculated by equation  ( [ eq : sn1 ] ) , where @xmath54 is simply the ratio of the area of the cluster region to that of the background field .",
    "@xmath55    from the array @xmath56 , we obtained an optimal mask envelope in the @xmath57 plane by setting a threshold @xmath58 ( maximum of @xmath56 ) and identifying the subgrid elements of @xmath59 . in order to do this ,",
    "the elements of @xmath53 were sorted into a series of gradually decreasing thresholds over the one - dimensional index @xmath60 . from the determined subgrid element with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath61 ) , a cumulative number of stars in the cluster area @xmath62",
    "was then counted through a progressively larger area @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the area of a single element of the c - m plane .",
    "the cumulative star counts for the background field @xmath65 were calculated in the same manner as for the cluster area .",
    "the cumulative signal - to - noise ratio @xmath66 was then determined by equation  ( [ eq : csn1 ] ) :    @xmath67    @xmath66 reaches a maximum value for a particular subarea of the c - m plane , and the corresponding value of @xmath53 is set to a threshold , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "now , the filtering mask area is chosen by selecting subgrid elements with larger @xmath53 values than the determined @xmath68 .",
    "the heavy lines in ( @xmath69 ) cmds in figure [ cmd1 ] represent the boundaries of the selected subgrid elements .",
    "the faint limits of the filtering mask areas were assigned to be @xmath70 for ngc 5466 and @xmath71 for the other clusters to avoid biases caused by the poor completeness ( @xmath72 ) of the photometry and by the variable seeing conditions over the surveyed sky areas during the observations .",
    "finally , the entire sample of stars in the determined filtering mask area was considered in the subsequent analyses to examine the spatial configuration around the target clusters .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the analytic results related to the spatial configuration of stars in the vicinity of target clusters individually for each cluster .",
    "details of the extended tidal features with significant overdensities of stars over the limiting tidal radii of the clusters are examined by ( 1 ) the spatial surface density map of stars , ( 2 ) the radial profiles of the surface density , and ( 3 ) the azimuthal number density profiles as a function of position angle at various radial distances from the cluster center .    to construct a spatial surface density map",
    ", we first made a two - dimensional star count map by binning into small grids on the spatial stellar distributions of the c - m mask - selected stars for each cluster .",
    "the background density level was simply assigned by the measured mean surface density value for the region outside the tidal radius of each cluster since a variation with relatively low background density does not seriously affect to the two - dimensional configuration of stellar distribution around a cluster .",
    "the background - subtracted star count map was transformed into a smoothed surface density map by means of a gaussian smoothing algorithm that enhanced the low spatial frequency of the background variation and removed the high frequency of the spatial stellar density variation .",
    "then , we overlaid isodensity contour levels with a standard deviation unit ( @xmath73 ) of the background level on the smoothed maps with various kernel values .",
    "as an analytic indicator to confirm the overdensity feature around the tidal radius of a cluster , the radial surface density profile of a cluster was derived by measuring the number of stars in concentric annuli with a @xmath74 width .",
    "the effective radius of each annulus is assigned by the equation @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the inner and outer radii of an annulus , respectively .",
    "radial surface density profiles for a different direction are also derived , for which we divided an annulus with @xmath78 widths into eight sections ( s1@xmath79s8 ) with an angle of @xmath6 , as shown in figure  [ annuly ] . here ,",
    "we caution that the radial surface densities at the central region of cluster fields are usually underestimated by crowding effects . in order to examine the crowding effects",
    ", we added appropriate number of artificial stars with @xmath80 magnitudes in the range of the c - m mask - selected area ( figure  [ cmd1 ] ) to the @xmath80 images of each cluster , and we calculated the mean radial recovery rates of the input artificial stars as completenesses in photometric measurements out to @xmath81 from the cluster s center .",
    "considering the determined photometric completenesses , we empirically fit the  @xcite models to the observed radial surface density profiles of target clusters over a radial range that keeps up recovery rates in stable with high completenesses .",
    "it is worth noting that  @xcite have used the  @xcite models to describe properly the outer surface density structure of the majority of globular clusters in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "it is true that the wilson models are spatially extended more than the  @xcite models , but the wilson models have still finite truncated tidal radii .",
    "this leads that the wilson models are unlikely to describe extratidal overdensity features of globular clusters , which are usually characterized by a break and radially untruncated power laws of the surface density profiles",
    ".    clusters with obvious extratidal extensions showed a break in the observed radial surface density profiles near the tidal radius  @xcite , which departs from the form predicted by the  @xcite models .",
    "numerical simulations also confirmed such a break with power laws in the radial surface density profiles due to the features of tidal debris around the clusters  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed ,  @xcite predicted that for a constant mass - loss rate , the radial surface densities of stripped stars in the tidal tails are proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "however ,  @xcite found that the annular - averaged density of stars along the well - defined extratidal tails around pal 5 is fit to a power law with a significantly steeper slope than that predicted by  @xcite .",
    "for the target clusters in this paper , we fit a power law of @xmath83 to the outer part of radial profiles measured in full concentric annuli , and compare the measured slope ( @xmath84 ) with those of  @xcite and  @xcite . to investigate directions of the overdensity feature",
    ", we also measure slopes of power laws for the radial surface density profiles to eight angular sections with different directions .",
    "the azimuthal number density of stars with respect to a position angle was also derived for stars in an assigned annulus .",
    "the position angle was measured clockwise from the east principal axis in a @xmath85 unit .",
    "widths of each annulus were assigned to be @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the inner and outer regions , respectively , in order to contain a statistically sufficient number of stars in each area .",
    "the radially cumulative azimuthal number density profile was also derived to trace the direction of the stellar overdensity feature around the clusters .",
    "figure  [ m15con ] shows a raw star count map around m15 and the surface density maps smoothed with various gaussian kernel values of @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , from the upper - left panel to the lower - right panel .",
    "the spatial bin size of the star count map was originally set to be @xmath90 .",
    "several individual blank chips , which did not contain useful observational data in figure  [ m15con ] , were excluded from the subsequent analyses .",
    "isodensity plots were overlaid on the maps with the contour levels of @xmath91 , and @xmath92 above background density level , where @xmath73 is the standard deviation of the mean background value .",
    "contours in the star count map are the same as those in the smoothed surface density map with a gaussian kernel value of @xmath93 .",
    "the different arrows indicate directions of the galactic center ( short arrow ) and the projected absolute proper motion ( long arrow ) , i.e. , @xmath94 mas yr@xmath13 and @xmath95 mas yr@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the circle centered on the cluster indicates its tidal radius of @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "it is apparent in figure  [ m15con ] that the overdensity feature is obviously extended over the tidal radius of m15 at the levels larger than @xmath97 above the background .",
    "furthermore , the extratidal overdensity feature beyond the tidal radius seem to form extended tails around the cluster . among them , long tails to the southwest and northeast directions around the cluster are aligned apparently with the directions of the galactic center and anticenter .",
    "marginal extensions are present in the outskirts to the south and north directions , which could correspond to the cluster s orbit .",
    "the overdensity feature of the tails becomes more prominent in the lower resolution surface density maps with a larger gaussian kernal value .",
    "it is noted here that we did not find distinctive evidence for a southeast tidal extension as observed by  @xcite .",
    "the difference could be accounted for by the lower spatial resolution and the brighter photometric limiting magnitude used by them .",
    "indeed , most of the cluster stars in this study are faint main - sequence stars , while @xcite used the subgiant branch stars and main - sequence stars near the turn - off point of the cmd .",
    "note that  @xcite certified in their simulation that low mass stars were usually stripped from a globular cluster and formed tidal tails or streams .",
    "the radial surface densities for m15 measured in each concentric annulus are plotted in the upper panel of figure  [ m15king ] along with a theoretical king model of @xmath98 , which are arbitrarily normalized to our measurements .",
    "we also show two plots of the observed - minus - predicted residuals , @xmath99 , to illustrate the departures of the observed radial surface densities from the prediction of the king model , and of the photometric recovery rates to consider radial crowding effects on the observed profile .",
    "it is apparent in the plots that incompleteness due to crowding effects reduces the measured surface densities in the innermost region , while the radial surface density profile in the region outer than @xmath100 has completeness values larger than @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , the radial surface density profile departs from the king model with a break at a radius less than the tidal radius , i.e. , @xmath102 , and the excess extends to @xmath103 .",
    "the radial surface density profile in this overdensity region resembles a radial power law with a slope of @xmath104 , which is comparable to the value @xmath105 proposed by  @xcite from the annular - averaged densities of stars along the extratidal tails of pal 5 .",
    "however , the slope is significantly steeper than the case of @xmath106 , predicted for a constant mass - loss rate over a long time  @xcite .",
    "radial surface density profiles to eight angular sections with a different direction , as illustrated in figure  [ annuly ] , are also represented in the lower panel of figure  [ m15king ] .",
    "the overdensity feature in the region of @xmath107 is commonly detected in all eight angular sections .",

    "@xcite also found an increased surface density in the outer region of the radial density profile for ncg 5466 , which may be an indication of a tidal tail caused by unbound stars around the cluster .",

    "from an observational point of view ,  @xcite suggested that a merging of clusters would occur more preferentially in dwarf galaxies with low velocity dispersions of the cluster system in the range of 6.5@xmath20611 @xmath207  @xcite rather than in the milky way .",
    "to test the contamination of background galaxies in the field of m53 and ngc 5053 , we analyzed the spatial distribution of non - pointlike sdss sources .",
    "for the extracted sdss sources , we transformed the sdss @xmath0 magnitude system into @xmath29 and @xmath30 indices , using the equation ( 1 ) .",
    "sources falling into the masks in @xmath46 and @xmath47 planes , which were used to select cluster member stars , were applied to the sample of background galaxies . in figure  [ n5053m53gal ] , we show a smoothed surface density map of the selected background galaxies , overlaid with the surface density contours of cluster stars of figure  [ n5053m53contour ] . filled triangles indicate two abell clusters in the observed field .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ n5053m53gal ] , we found no strong correlation between the pattern of the surface density variation of the background galaxies and the observed spatial configuration of stars around m53 and ngc 5053 . also note that the dust extinction is low toward the clusters ( i.e. , e@xmath208 for m53 and e@xmath209 for ngc 5053 ) , and the variation in dust emission through the observed field is low as traced by the iras 100 @xmath108 m map .",
    "according to photometric results in this paper , it could be suggestive that the clusters m53 and ngc 5053 may be interacting or have interacted in the past . in the kinematic point of view",
    ", however , it would not be airtight that they originated with a same common dwarf spheroidal parent .",
    "the radial velocity of m53 is @xmath210 @xmath211 @xmath212 , but it is @xmath213 @xmath211 @xmath212 for ngc 5053  @xcite . in this case , the clusters might have a common space orbit to the similar direction , only if the tangential velocities are in same directions with exorbitantly larger values than their absolute values of radial velocities . the tangential velocity of m53 is estimated to be @xmath214 @xmath211 @xmath212 by using values of the proper motion , i.e. , @xmath145 mas yr@xmath13 and @xmath146 mas yr@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "even if we are taking into account of the large measurement error , the calculated tangential velocity of m53 is merely comparable to the absolute value of the radial velocity .",
    "unfortunately , we can not estimate the tangential velocity of ngc 5053 because the proper motion has not yet been reported .",
    "thus , the current kinematic information about radial velocities and inaccurate tangential motions of m53 and ngc 5053 makes it still hard to arrange if the clusters came from a common dwarf and were on similar paths through the galactic halo .",
    "also , their distance moduli , @xmath215 for m53 and @xmath216 for ngc 5053  @xcite , are still separated by @xmath217 kpc , a significant distance in the halo of the milky way compared with their tidal radii 112.7 pc for m53 and 66.8 pc for ngc 5053  @xcite . nevertheless , it should be noted that radial velocities of m53 and ngc 5053 are commensurate with those of the other clusters aligned in the magellanic plane  ( see figure 4c in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "radial velocities of the globular clusters in the plane show a sinusoidal pattern of keplerian motion as they are plotted against the orbital longitude measured along the magellanic plane .",
    "this is possibly indicative of a common origin of the clusters .",
    "the cluster ngc 5466 is at a 16.2 kpc distance from the galactic center .",
    "it is one of the low - metallicity clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath218 , and it has a low concentration with @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence of tidal tails around ngc 5466 in a radial density profile of the cluster .",
    "recently ,  @xcite observed tidal tails of ngc 5466 , stretching about @xmath219 in apposite directions . using sdss photometric data ,  @xcite found evidence for a much larger extension of the tidal tails , with the leading arm over @xmath190 and the trailing arm extending at least @xmath220 . from numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite reproduced the tidal tails around cluster ngc 5466 . in our study , analyses for spatial configuration of stars around ngc 5466 have indicated an overdensity feature extending outside the tidal radius of the cluster . in the spatial surface density maps in figure  [ n5466con ] , we have found an s - shape extratidal feature of tails stretching out symmetrically over @xmath179 in the observed field .",
    "the observed radial density profiles of ngc 5466 , as shown in figure  [ n5466king ] , show a departure from the king model , with a break at @xmath184 extending the overdensity feature out to @xmath135 of the cluster .",
    "azimuthal number density profiles in figure  [ n5466azim ] confirmed the orientation of the two tails around ngc 5466 , which is likely consistent with the cluster s orbit inferred from the cluster s proper motion .",
    "the results are reconfirmation of the tidal tails of ngc 5466 stretching as much as @xmath6 on the sky as reported by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of m53 and ngc 5053 , we checked contamination of background galaxies in the field of ngc 5466 by analyzing the spatial distribution of non - pointlike sdss sources .",
    "figure  [ n5466gal ] shows a smoothed surface density map of the selected background galaxies overlaid with the surface density contours of cluster stars from figure  [ n5466con ] . filled triangles",
    "indicate eight abell clusters in the observed field .",
    "as shown in figure  [ n5466gal ] , the pattern of density variations in the selected galaxy sample does not seem to be correlated with the location of the tidal tails around ngc 5466 .",
    "however , the spatial configuration of the selected background galaxies in the southern area of the observed field is likely correlated with the clumpy overdensity feature of the surface density maps of selected cluster member stars of figure  [ n5466con ] .",
    "the observed field is not polluted by strong dust extinction ( e@xmath221 ) .",
    "the other two low - metallicity clusters m68 and m92 in the magellanic plane , for which we did not secure the wide - field deep photometric data from the present observations , are located on 10.1 kpc and 9.6 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "indications of extratidal extensions of stars around the clusters incidently have been overlooked in a few previous studies .",
    "@xcite used the dposs plates to show an circular structure of extratidal halo around m92 extending out to @xmath222 from the cluster center .",
    "also ,  @xcite used cfht mosaic ccd imaging to discover a presence of extratidal materials in the radial density profile of m92 and a weak tidal halo around the cluster . in addition ,  @xcite found an indication for extratidal overdensity feature around m68 using photographic plates taken at the ukst .",
    "nevertheless , there have been little evidences for extratidal tails toward any preferred directions on the spatial stellar distributions around both of the clusters because of the lower spatial resolutions and the brighter limiting magnitudes of the photographic and ccd photometry .",
    "thus we note the need for deeper wide - field ccd photometry to investigate spatial structure of the extended extratidal tails around both of the clusters .",
    "the spatial configuration of stars tidally stripped from a parent stellar system of a present globular cluster contains direct information of the dynamical evolution that the cluster has experienced . along with internal dynamical processes , external perturbations , such as disk and bulge shocks by the galaxy ,",
    "could accelerate the cluster s dynamical evolution  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with respect to external dynamical evolution , three clusters , m15 , ngc 5053 and ngc 5466 among our five targets might have experienced strong interactions with the galaxy in the form of disk and bulge shocks , as indicated by the ratios of destruction rates with @xmath223 , and @xmath224 , respectively , for each cluster  @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath225 and @xmath226 are the total destruction rate and the evaporation rate per hubble time , respectively .",
    "furthermore ,  @xcite suggested that tidal tails usually stretch into the galactic center , as the effect of both bulge and disk shock or the bulge shock to the cluster is much stronger than disk shock for the cluster .",
    "this implies that tidal tails stretching into the galactic center and anticenter around the three clusters m15 , ngc 5053 and ngc 5466 might be a result of both the bulge and disk shock of the galaxy .",
    "two other clusters , m30 and m53 , are not expected to suffer strong gravitational shocks by the galaxy , with @xmath227 .",
    "this would be a reason why the tidal tail feature of m30 is not well defined in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "also , the tidal bridge - like feature and an envelope structure around m53 may not be the results of gravitational shocks of the galaxy but the interaction with the companion cluster ngc 5053 .",
    "in addition , apparent extratidal extensions around the other two globular clusters m68 and m92 with @xmath228 and @xmath229 , respectively , may not be the results of suffering strong gravitational shocks by the galaxy . in spite of such a dependency on the galactic potential to the dynamical structure of the observed tidal tails",
    ", we found here that the feature of extratidal extensions around the target clusters is unlikely to have any distinctive correlation with the galactocentric distance of each cluster .    on the other hands , many numerical simulations of tidal tails performed over the past decade  ( i.e. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that the stars dissolved from a globular cluster by the galactic tidal force slowly drift along the cluster s orbit due to the orbital motion and the coriolis acceleration , and then eventually form a dense tidal tail parallel to the cluster s orbit . in this paper , we found that all of the observed low - metallicity clusters have shown possible extratidal extensions to the direction of the clusters orbits , which are inferred from their proper motions .",
    "indeed , the five target globular clusters are assumed to lie on one spatial orbital plane in the outer galactic halo , and their kinematic motions place also almost on this plane  @xcite , which are considered as a result of accretion of dwarf galaxies .",
    "based on a comparison of population and kinematics ,  @xcite suggested that lmc is the possible parent galaxy of these halo globular clusters .",
    "however , recent studies  @xcite have stated that m53 , ngc 5053 and ngc 5466 are possible former members of the sgr galaxy . to examine a possible association of the clusters with the sgr orbit or magellanic debris plane",
    ", we mark the three clusters on the planes formed by the rectangular galactocentric coordinates with @xmath230 and @xmath231 in kiloparsecs , as shown in figure  [ psmv ] .",
    "the magellanic debris plane  @xcite and the sgr orbit  @xcite are also overlaid in figure  [ psmv ] .",
    "we also plotted the space motion vectors of two clusters m53 and ngc 5466 with the uncertainties in directions , in order to see their velocity coherence to the two orbital planes .",
    "space motion vector of ngc 5053 is not plotted , since the proper motion of the cluster is not available . as shown in figure  [ psmv ] ,",
    "m53 is likely to move in a direction along the magellanic plane .",
    "the space motion of m53 is perpendicular to the sgr orbit in @xmath232 plane , and it is directionally opposite in @xmath233 plane to the orbital direction of the sgr dwarf .",
    "the space motion vector of ngc 5466 in @xmath233 plane seems to be parallel to the direction of the sgr orbit , but it is not conclusive that ngc 5466 is moving along the sgr orbit .",
    "the space motion of ngc 5466 in @xmath232 plane is against the sgr orbit , and it seems to move in a direction along to the magellanic plane within the uncertainty order of @xmath234  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , ngc 5466 is closer in space to the magellanic plane than to the sgr orbit .",
    "ngc 5053 lies remarkably closer to the magellanic plane than to the sgr orbit , while it has no information about the space motion .",
    "these lead us to conclude that the three clusters m53 , ngc 5053 , and ngc 5466 , are potentially associated with the magellanic plane rather than the sgr orbit .    under these observational conditions , tidal tails for the five target globular clusters",
    "are expected to have a common feature of kinematic orbital properties , which would provide information about their parent dwarf galaxies .",
    "although the spatial extensions and morphological shapes exhibited different regimes of developments for the observed extratidal tails , all the observed target clusters presented evidences of tidal tails tracing their orbits , as inferred from the projected directions of their proper motions .",
    "thus , it appears that the tidal tails to the cluster s orbit for five target metal poor halo clusters are indeed evidences for an accreted origin from satellite system . also , these observational results of extratidal tail features around the five target clusters provide further evidences of the merging scenario of the formation for the galactic halo , and in addition an important constraint on the potential in the galactic halo  @xcite .",
    "data for more accurate proper motions of target clusters and radial velocities of stars in the observed extratidal structures are essential to verify their association with a stream in the galactic halo .",
    "furthermore , larger area coverage with accurate deep photometric data will also enable us to better constrain the orbits of the target clusters and cluster s member stars in the extratidal structures .",
    "with information about the spatial positions , radial velocities and proper motions of stars in the tidal tails , we could integrate their orbits backwards in the galactic potential and eventually ascertain the origin of the globular clusters in the galactic halo .",
