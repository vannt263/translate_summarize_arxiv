    "the shallow ms slope seen at @xmath30 since @xmath31 has been argued to be a consequence of the inclusion of quenched mass in massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "this idea can be easily interpreted since the quenched component of a sfg contributes to @xmath1 but does not to the sfr , thus naturally resulting in a flattening in the sfr@xmath23 relation .",
    "the observations support this scenario . in the nearby universe",
    ", it has been well established that the low mass sfgs ( @xmath32 ) are generally disk - dominated and composed by young stellar populations @xcite , whereas the more massive ones usually harbor a prominent bulge component containing relatively old stellar populations @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) in the bulges of massive disk galaxies can be an order of magnitude lower than that in the disks , i.e. , the bulges are indeed quenched @xcite .",
    "a similar picture appears to hold at higher redshifts .",
    "@xcite studied the stacked h@xmath5 map of sfgs at @xmath33 $ ] and found that there is a strong central dip in the equivalent width of h@xmath5 for massive sfgs , indicating the existence of a relatively old bulge component . even at the cosmic star formation peak",
    ", there is evidence that the most massive sfgs ( @xmath34 ) have already harbored a quenched bulge component at @xmath35 , resembling their counterparts at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "since the fraction of bulgy sfgs rapidly increases above @xmath36 @xcite , the quenched mass could be a potentially important contributor to the mass budget of sfgs .",
    "the quenched mass portion contained in a sfg ( hereafter referred as @xmath0 ) directly characterizes the  maturity degree \" of that galaxy , however is not well explored in previous studies .",

    "however , one can possibly quantify the _ average _ @xmath0 for the whole sfg population with very general information , as described below . in this paper , we develop a toy model to quantify the average @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 by utilizing the bending effect of the quenched mass on the observed sfr@xmath23 relation . the observations that less massive galaxies with @xmath37 consistently follow a redshift - independent @xmath15 ms slope , lead us to the basic assumption of this model , that sfgs with a @xmath38 consistently follow a ms slope @xmath6 , where @xmath39 .",

    "this supports that the @xmath0 estimation is robust at high masses as long as the main sequence parameters are well determined .",
    "however , @xmath0 is strongly dependent on the choice of the free parameters at @xmath37 , implying that this method may be no longer valid in the low mass regime .",
    "we further discuss this in the caveat section .",
    "it should be noted that there are non - ignorable uncertainties in the sfr and @xmath1 estimates , which may affect the measured ms parameters .",
    "fortunately , these uncertainties only contribute to the dispersion of the ms relation and do not affect its slope @xcite .",
    "therefore , the estimated @xmath0 is robust against these measurement uncertainties . to conclude",

    "in contrast , the mass growth of low mass galaxies is dominated by in - situ star formation and the role of mergers is minor @xcite . as the analysis below is mainly focused on galaxies with @xmath37 , we will only consider the role of star formation in stellar mass growth and assume that mergers do not affect our final conclusion .",
    "given this assumption , the stellar mass growth in a sfg between @xmath79 and @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the return fraction due to mass loss .",
    "the return fraction @xmath82 is a function of time .",
    "however , as almost mass loss is within the first @xmath83 years , we fix @xmath82 to 0.36 ( for a @xcite imf ) in the following discussion .",

    "specifically , the sfr can maintain at least over @xmath85 yr , as supported by the good consistency between the dust - corrected uv and h@xmath5-based sfr , both in the local @xcite and the high redshift universe @xcite . in the case",
    "that the sfr keeps constant over the time interval probed , then equation ( 8) can be written as @xmath86 .    without quenching processes ,",
    "then a sfg may maintain its sfr over a very long period after the sfr reaches a relatively stable value @xmath87 .",
    "assuming the sfr reaches @xmath87 at @xmath88 and keeps constant ( or roughly constant ) at @xmath89 , then at any cosmic time @xmath90 ( where @xmath89 ) its stellar mass @xmath91 is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the stellar mass formed prior to @xmath88 . in the case of @xmath94 , then @xmath95 .",
    "for the whole sfg population , it should be reasonable assuming that the majority reaches a stable sfr at a similar @xmath96 .",
    "this assumption is supported by the simulation of @xcite , who showed that galaxies reach their stable sfr at @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the global sfr@xmath18@xmath1 relation can be expressed as log(sfr)=log(@xmath98@xmath18log@xmath99 in the logarithmic space , which naturally results in an @xmath14 ms slope as observed",
    ".        however , this scenario should be over simple since it is not realistic for individual galaxies to strictly follow a constant sfr over a hubble time .",
    "for sfgs , there are considerable variations in the star formation histories even at a fixed @xmath1 , which are then manifested in the dispersion of the observed sfr@xmath23 relation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that the  constant sfr \" assumption should be interpreted in a  population - average \" sense and does not necessarily hold for individual galaxies .",
    "in the above section we proposed a scenario in which sfgs keep their sfrs roughly constant over cosmic time . as a consequence ,",
    "the stellar mass of a galaxy linearly correlates with cosmic time @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath100 , which then naturally results in an @xmath15 slope in the log(sfr)@xmath18log(@xmath1 ) relation .",
    "this scenario predicts that the position of a sfg on the log(sfr)@xmath18log(@xmath1 ) plane simply shifts towards higher masses as increasing @xmath90 , while keeping its sfr unchanged . as such ,",
    "given a log(sfr)@xmath18log(@xmath1 ) relation at a starting cosmic time @xmath101 , one can predict the ms at any @xmath90 . to verify this scenario , in this section",
    "we compare the model predicted ms relations with observations .",
    "we emphasize that this comparison is only meaningful for low mass galaxies with @xmath37 since we assume that they are not significantly influenced by the quenching processes .",

    "we also complement the ms data at @xmath17 from @xcite .",
    "the sfrs of @xcite are estimated from the ultraviolet and 24 @xmath104 m infrared photometry , while those of @xcite are from the observed h@xmath5 fluxes .",
    "both works have assumed a @xcite imf in the sfr and @xmath1 estimates .",
    "we choose a starting point of @xmath105 to predict the ms relations at @xmath106 or at @xmath107 under the scenario proposed above .",
    "a @xmath105 is chosen since at this redshift the observation reported ms slope ( @xmath108 ) is most close to our expectation .",

    "@xcite fit the ms with @xmath111 as shown in the green solid line in figure  [ fig3 ] .",

    "as can be seen , the predicted ms relations clearly do not match the observations .",
    "this may indicate that the proposed scenario is incorrect .",

    "this may arise from the problems in stellar mass estimates , star formation rate estimates , or both ( see @xcite and @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . nevertheless , the good consistency between the model predicted and observed ms relations over a wide redshift range still strongly support this scenario .",

    "for example , the @xmath0 can be greater than 50% for sfgs with @xmath136 .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "@xcite reach their conclusions based on a small sample of 22 sfgs ( only 5 with @xmath137 ) , which may be seriously biased to selection effects . since the @xmath0 estimation depends on the parameters of the ms , figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "thus confirms their finding in a more statistical sense .    using the stellar mass functions , early works",
    "have estimated star - forming and quenched stellar mass density in the universe @xcite .",
    "these works do not consider the hidden quenched mass in sfgs , thus will certainly underestimate the true quenched mass density .",
    "we revisit this issue by taking @xmath0 into consideration . the corrected mass density for the star - forming and quenched component should be @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the stellar mass density of qgs and sfgs derived from their stellar mass functions , respectively . in this paper",
    "we adopt the stellar mass functions reported by @xcite , who also use the @xmath56 technology to define sfgs and qgs .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] . as can be seen , without correcting for @xmath0 , the quenched mass density takes over at @xmath141 , which is already reported in early works .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] reveals that the quenched mass density doubles ( increase @xmath144 dex ) after correcting for @xmath0 at @xmath135 , i.e. , the sfgs contribute equally or even more than qgs do to the total quenched mass budget .",
    "although remains to be confirmed , this could be the case in the early cosmic epoch when quenching just started at work . as the quenching processes proceed in an inside - out manner in massive sfgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , it makes sense that the quenched mass primarily exists in the bulges of massive sfgs when quenching is still at its preliminary stage .",
    "we have developed a toy model to interpret the slope of the log(sfr)@xmath18log(@xmath1 ) relation of star - forming galaxies .",
    "our model splits a sfg into a quenched plus a star - forming component , which is initially inspired by the observations that bulges are generally quenched while disks are still forming stars @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that the quenched mass mentioned in this paper is not strictly equal to the bulge mass for two reasons .",
    "first , star - forming bulges do also exist , especially at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "second , a considerable fraction of the old stars can migrate from the bulge to the outer disk due to resonant scattering with transient spiral arms @xcite , making these two components indistinguishable even with the help of a disk - bulge decomposition .",
    "in section  [ sec3 ] we argue that the ms will naturally have an @xmath15 slope once sfgs enter a steady - stage star formation phase .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] further verifies the capability of this scenario in explaining the observed evolution of the ms over @xmath145 $ ] at @xmath37 .",
    "in fact the notion that low mass galaxies generally have an extended star formation history is not new .",
    "previous works on galaxy stellar populations have indicated that while the massive galaxies form the majority of their stellar mass at @xmath146 , the less massive ones grow their mass with a similar speed over a hubble time ( .e.g .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a similar conclusion is also reached by studies with independent approaches .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite study the average star formation history of galaxies in dark matter haloes from high redshifts to the present day using an abundance matching method .",
    "they both find that the low mass haloes ( @xmath147 ) have a steady sfr since @xmath148 .",
    "this steady - stage star formation phase is likely a consequence of stellar feedback .",
    "stellar feedback has long been served as an important mechanism that shaping various properties of galaxies in the low mass regime , including the stellar surface density @xcite , the metallicity @xcite and the morphologies @xcite .",
    "the star - of - the - art numerical simulations have successfully produced a low star formation efficiency in low mass haloes as seen in observations by taking explicit stellar feedback physics into consideration ( .e.g .",

    "* ) . in the fire simulation ,",
    "a galaxy will reach a steady sfr phase at @xmath149 , at which the stellar feedback appears to dominate gas dynamics @xcite . without additional quenching mechanisms ( such as active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback or halo shock heating ) involved , the simulations indicate that the galaxy will maintain its sfr for a long period ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that a @xmath150 correcting factor is useful in interpreting some recent findings .",
    "@xcite used the ms relation to predict the evolution of stellar mass function from @xmath16 to @xmath26 .",
    "they found that the galaxy number density @xmath151 is systematically over predicted by @xmath152 0.2 dex at @xmath37 ( see their figure 10 ) .",
    "since the stellar mass function has a faint end slope of @xmath153 , this effect can be equivalently interpreted as a @xmath152 0.4 dex overestimation in @xmath1 , as @xcite did not include a @xmath114 factor in their calculations .    in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we show that @xmath0 is already considerably high for massive sfgs at the peak of cosmic star formation ( @xmath154 ) . as the quenched mass",
    "is primarily associated with bulges , this indicates that the bulge buildup process is highly efficient at high redshifts . at @xmath148 , galaxies are gas rich and typically have a gas fraction around 0.4 - 0.5 @xcite .",
    "with such a high cold gas fraction , a large amount of the gas will sink into the centers of galaxies due to violent disc instability , triggering central starbursts and forming a prominent bulge @xcite .",
    "this merger - free bulge forming scenario is supported by the recent work of @xcite , who use alma and kmos observations on 25 main sequence galaxies to reveal that the rotation - supported sfgs at @xmath148 have very intense central star formation rate .",
    "they conclude that these galaxies are able to form a compact bulge with a central 1kpc stellar mass density @xmath155 in a few @xmath83 years .",
    "the link between the emergence of a quenched bulge and the fully quenching of a massive galaxy is still missing .",
    "bulges are generally quenched , indicating that quenching may first operate from the inner galaxy regions .",
    "this is likely associated with a central starburst episode @xcite , which is possibly accompanied by strong gas outflow driven by agns @xcite .",
    "however , an external process such as the shut - down of cold gas accretion may also needed to explain the subsequent suppression of star formation in the outer part of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the detailed quenching mechanism is key to galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "note that in section  [ sec3 ] we have ignored mergers . at high masses ,",
    "the role of mergers in mass growth can not be easily ignored . in merger remnants , it is not clear whether the star - forming component still follow a same sfr@xmath156 relation as their progenitors . however ,",
    "if the properties of the star - forming component are not significantly changed during the merging process , the scaling relation between sfr and @xmath2 should remain for the merger remnants .",
    "second , the @xmath0 derived in this model should be treated as an _ upper limit _ of the true value since we have assumed that the quenched mass is fully responsible for the flattening of the ms .",
    "this is not well justified and there may also exist other mechanisms that can lead to the flattening .",
    "for example , @xcite claimed that the massive sfgs at @xmath157 have a decreased star formation efficiency that can up to a factor of 3 compared to the less massive ones , thus responsible for the flattening of the ms .",
    "however , the findings of @xcite is not seen in the local universe .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the mean atomic and molecular gas mass fraction along the ms at @xmath17 with the data from the alfalfa , gass and cold gass surveys . in contrary to @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that both star formation efficiency and molecular - to - atomic gas ratio vary little for massive sfgs , indicating the flattening of the local ms is due to the global decrease of the cold gas reservoir rather than a depression in star formation efficiency .",
    "third , the model may be less physical for less massive sfgs .",
    "this is because less massive galaxies are disk dominated and do not harbor a notable quenched component .",
    "in addition , the model predicted @xmath0 is strongly dependent on @xmath63 and @xmath6 at low masses ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) , both of which are free parameters that can not be firmly constrained .",
    "although the model predicts a very low @xmath0 in the low mass regime that still seems reasonable , we suggest that this value is not meaningful .",
    "in this paper , we develop a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion ( @xmath0 ) of sfgs and to reconcile the star formation sequence slopes both in the low and the high mass regimes .",
    "our results are summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . in this toy model ,",
    "each sfg is composed by a star - forming plus a quenched component .",
    "the mass of the star - forming component ( @xmath2 ) correlates with the sfr following a relation sfr @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "the quenched component contributes to the total stellar mass while does nt to the sfr , thus driving the observed ms slope @xmath5 depart from @xmath6 .",
    "the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath5 thus can be used to infer @xmath0 , as given in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "we propose a scenario to interpret the origin of the @xmath14 main sequence slope seen at @xmath37 . in this scenario ,",
    "the majority of low mass sfgs are less influenced by the quenching processes , thus keeping a steady sfr over cosmic time .",
    "as such , the stellar mass of a galaxy linearly correlates with cosmic time @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath100 , which then naturally results in an @xmath15 slope in the log(sfr)@xmath18log(@xmath1 ) relation .",
    "the observed ms relations in the low mass regime agree well with the model predictions at @xmath158 $ ] , which supports this scenario .",
    "we suggest that the steady - stage star formation phase is driven by stellar feedback .",
    "\\3 . adopting the redshift - dependent main sequence slope reported by @xcite",
    ", we explore the evolution of the @xmath7 relation over @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we find that milky - way - like sfgs typically have a @xmath10 at @xmath11 , whereas this value rapidly rises up to @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "taking @xmath0 into consideration , we retrieve the stellar mass density budget of the universe , finding the quenched mass has been taking over in galaxies with @xmath137 since @xmath11 .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a very constructive report that helped to improve the quality of this paper .",
