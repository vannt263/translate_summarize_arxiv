    "when @xmath0 is large , spin systems can be modeled by classical and semiclassical techniques . here",
    "we reserve `` semiclassical '' to mean not only that the technique works in the limit of large @xmath0 ( as the term is sometimes used ) but that it implements the quantum - classical correspondence ( relating classical trajectories to quantum - mechanical behavior ) .",
    "spin systems ( in particular @xmath1 ) are often thought as the antithesis of the classical limit . notwithstanding that , classical - quantum correspondence has been studied at large values of @xmath0 in systems such as an autonomous single spin @xcite , kicked single spin @xcite , and autonomous two @xcite and three @xcite spin systems .",
    "when the classical motion has a chaotic regime , for example , the dependence of level statistics on the regularity of classical motion has been studied @xcite . in regimes where the motion is predominantly regular ,",

    "the latter sort of calculation has potential applications to some problems of current numerical or experimental interest .",
    "numerical diagonalizations for extended spin systems ( in ordered phases ) on lattices of modest size ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 spins ) may be analyzed by treating the net spin of each sublattice as a single large spin and thereby reducing the system to an autonomous cluster of a few spins ; the clustering of low - lying eigenvalues can probe symmetry breakings that are obscured in a system of such size if only ground - state correlations are examined .",

    "both the fm and afm states , as well as all other states of the system , are continuously degenerate with respect to rotations around the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the classical dynamics follows from the fact that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are conjugate , where @xmath17 and @xmath16 are the polar angles of the unit vector @xmath18 ; then hamilton s equations of motion say @xmath19    in the rest of this paper , we will first introduce the classical dynamics by surveying the fundamental periodic orbits of the three - spin cluster , determined by numerical integration of the equations of motion ( sec  [ sec - classical ] ) .",

    "our subsequent semiclassical analysis will depend on identification of all the fundamental orbits and their qualitative changes as parameters are varied .",

    "comparing figure [ fig : c3os ] and figure [ fig : classicaletau ] we see that our orbit spectrum detects the fundamental periodic orbits as well as multiple transversals of the orbits .",
    "interestingly , we produced figure [ fig : c3os ] before we had identified most of the fundamental orbits ; figure [ fig : c3os ] correctly predicted three out of four families of orbits .",
    "we believe that , given the same data , the ar method normally produces a far sharper spectrum .",
    "this is not surprising , since the fourier analysis allows the possibility of orbit - spectrum density at all @xmath70 values , whereas ar takes advantage of our _ a priori _ knowledge that there are only a few fundamental periodic orbits and hence only a few peaks .",
    "we have compared the fourier and ar versions of the spectrum in a few cases , but have not systematically tested them against each other .",
    "unfortunately , the artifacts and limitations of the ar method are less understood than those of the fourier transform . at high energies ,",
    "the classical periods are nearly degenerate , so we expect closely spaced spectral peaks in the orbit spectrum .",
    "in this situation , the burg algorithm vacillates between fitting one or two peaks causing the braiding between the ( a ) and ( c ) orbits ( labeled in figure [ fig : classicaletau ] ) in figure [ fig : c3os ] .",

    "the lowest - order thomas fermi approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : thomasfermi ] ) predicts that the area of the classical energy surface is proportional to the dos .",
    "we verify this in figure  [ fig : flatspot ] , a comparison of the heavily smoothed quantum dos to the area of the energy surface computed by monte carlo integration .",
    "an energy interval is visible in which the quantum dos appears to be constant ; we then verified that the classical dos ( which is more precise ) is constant to our numerical precision ; a similar interval was observed for all values of @xmath78 .",
    "we identified this interval as @xmath79 , where the endpoints are associated with changes in the topology of the energy surface as the energy varies .    at energies below @xmath80 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : afmcat ] ) ) , the energy surface consists of two disconnected pieces , one surrounding each afm ground state .",
    "the two parts coalesce as the energy surface becomes multiply connected at @xmath81 for @xmath82 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : polar ] ) ) the anisotropic interaction confines the spins to a limited band of latitude away from the poles . at @xmath83",
    "it becomes possible for spins to pass over the poles . at @xmath84 the holes that appeared in the energy surface at @xmath80",
    "a discontinuity in the slope of the area of the energy surface occurs at energy @xmath80 ( not visible in figure [ fig : flatspot ] ) ; in the range @xmath85 the area of the energy surface ( and hence the slowly varying part of the dos ) seems to be constant as a function of energy .    in the special isotropic ( @xmath86 )",
    "case , the flat interval is @xmath87 and it can be analytically derived that the dos is constant there .",
    "this is simplest for the smoothed quantum dos , since for @xmath88 there are clusters of @xmath89 energy levels with level spacing proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "( a derivation also exists for the classical case , but is less direct . )",
    "we have no analytic results for general @xmath78 .",
    "this flat interval is specific to our three - spin cluster , but we expect that the compactness of spin phase space will , generally , cause changes in the energy surface topology of spin systems that do not occur in traditionally studied particle systems .",
    "the quantum levels with total @xmath90 show rich patterns of clustering , some of which are visible on figure  [ fig : c3low ] .",
    "the levels that form clusters correspond to three different regimes of the classical dynamics in which the motion becomes nearly regular : ( 1 ) the fm limit ( not visible in figure  [ fig : c3low ] ; ( 2 ) the afm limit ( bottom edge of figure  [ fig : c3low ] ) and ( 3 ) the isotropic limit @xmath86 ( left edge of figure  [ fig : c3low ] ) .",
    "indeed , the levels form a hierarchy in as the clusters break up into subclusters . in this section ,",
    "we first approximately map the phase space from four coordinates to two coordinates  with the topology of a _",
    "sphere_. ( two of the original six coordinates are trivial , or decoupled , due to symmetry , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec - classical ] .",
    "then , using einstein - brillouin - kramers ( ebk ) quantization some consideration of quantum tunneling , many features of the level hierarchy will be understood .",
    "[ subsec : polyads ]    in all three limiting regimes , the classical dynamics becomes trivial . for small deviations from the limit",
    ", the equations of motion can be linearized and one finds that the trajectory decomposes into a linear combination of two harmonic oscillators with degenerate frequency @xmath91 , i.e. , in a 1:1 resonance ; the oscillators are coupled only by higher - order ( = nonlinear ) terms .",
    "there is a general prescription for understanding the classical dynamics in this situation  @xcite . near the limit",
    ", the low - excited levels have approximate quantum numbers @xmath92 such that the excitation energy @xmath93 in oscillator @xmath49 is @xmath94 .",
    "( in the fm limit , regime ( 1 ) , this difference is actually measured _ downwards _ from the energy maximum . ) clearly , the levels with a given total quantum number @xmath95 must have nearly degenerate energies , and thus form a cluster of levels , which are split only by the effects ( to be considered shortly ) of the anharmonic perturbation .",
    "a level cluster arising in this fashion is called a _ polyad _  @xcite .    to reduce the classical dynamics , make a canonical transformation to the variables @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath96 is the mean of the oscillators phases and @xmath98 is their phase difference , and @xmath99 here @xmath96 is the fast coordinate , with trivial dynamics @xmath100 in the harmonic limit .",
    "the slow coordinates @xmath101 follow a trajectory confined to the `` polyad phase sphere '' @xmath102 , since @xmath103 is conserved by the harmonic - order dynamics .",
    "the reduced dynamics on this sphere is properly a map @xmath104 , defined by ( say ) the poincar section at @xmath105 .",
    "but @xmath106 contains only higher powers of the components of @xmath101 , so near the harmonic ( small @xmath107 ) limit , @xmath108 vanishes and the reduced dynamics becomes a flow .",
    "@xcite at the limit in which it is a flow , an effective hamiltonian @xmath109 can be defined so that the dynamics becomes integrable .",
    "@xcite applying ebk quantization to the reduced dynamics on the polyad phase sphere gives the splitting of levels within a polyad cluster .",
    "( near the harmonic limit , the energy scale of @xmath109 is small compared to the splitting between polyads . )    in all three of our regimes , we believe this flow has the topology shown schematically in figure  [ fig : flows ] .",
    "@xcite besides reflection symmetry about the `` equator '' , it also has a threefold rotation symmetry around the @xmath110 axis , which corresponds to the cyclic permutation of the three spins .",
    "@xcite ( figure  [ fig : flows ] is natural for the three - spin system because it is the simplest generic topology of the phase sphere with that threefold symmetry . )",
    "the reduced dynamics has two symmetry - related fixed points at the `` poles '' @xmath111 , which always correspond to motions of the three - phase sort like ( d ) on figure  [ fig : tracks ] .",
    "there are also three stable and three unstable fixed points around the `` equator '' .",
    "the kam tori of the full dynamics correspond to orbits of the reduced dynamics .",
    "these orbits follow contours of the effective hamiltonian @xmath109 of the reduced dynamics ( as in figure  [ fig : flows ] ) . in view of the symmetries",
    "mentioned , @xmath112 to leading order , where @xmath113,@xmath114 , and the constant may depend on @xmath78 , @xmath0 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the kam tori surrounding the three - phase orbits represented by the `` poles '' are twofold degenerate , while the tori in the stable resonant islands represented on the `` equator '' are threefold degenerate .",
    "hence , the ebk construction produces degenerate subclusters containing two or three levels depending on the energy range within the polyad cluster .",
    "the fraction of levels in one or the other kind of subcluster is proportional to the spherical areas on the corresponding side of the separatrix , which passes through the unstable points in figure  [ fig : flows ] .",
    "these areas in turn depend on the ratio of the first to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) , i.e. @xmath115 . evidently , as one moves away from the harmonic limit to higher values of @xmath107 , one universally expects to have a larger and larger fraction of threefold subclusters .",
    "given the numerical values of energy levels in a polyad , we can estimate the terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) in the following fashion : ( i ) the energy difference between the highest and lowest 3-fold subcluster is the difference between the stable and unstable orbits on the equator , which is @xmath116 according to ( [ eq : i ] ) ; ( ii ) the mean of the highest and lowest 3-fold subcluster would be the energy all around the equator if @xmath114 were to vanish ; the difference between this energy and that of the farthest 2-fold subcluster in the polyad is @xmath117 according to ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "furthermore , tunneling between nearby tori creates _ fine structure _ splitting inside the sub - clusters .",
    "the slow part of the dynamics on the polyad phase sphere , is identical to that of a single semiclassical spin with ( [ eq : i ] ) as its effective hamiltonian , so the effective lagrangian is essentially the same , too .",
    "then different tunneling paths connecting the same two quantized orbits must differ in phase by a topological term , with a familiar form proportional to the ( real part of the ) spherical area between the two paths .",
    "@xcite      here we summarize some observations made by examination of polyads in the three regimes , for a few combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath78 .",
    "this regime is the best - behaved in that regular behavior persists for a wide range of energies .",
    "the ferromagnetic state , an energy maximum , is a fixed point of the dynamics ; around it are `` spin - wave '' excitations ( viewing our system as the 3-site case of a one dimensional ferromagnet ) .",
    "these are the two oscillators from which the polyad is constructed .",
    "thus , the `` pole '' points in figure  [ fig : flows ] correspond to `` spin waves '' propagating clockwise or counterclockwise around the ring of three spins , an example of the `` three - phase '' type of orbit .",
    "the stable and unstable points on the `` equator '' are identified respectively with the orbits ( a ) and ( c ) of figure  [ fig : tracks ] .",
    "classically , in this regime , the three - phase orbit is the fundamental orbit with lowest frequency @xmath118 ; thus the corresponding levels in successive polyads have a somewhat smaller spacing @xmath119 than other levels , and they end up at the top of each polyad .",
    "( remember excitation energy is measured _ downwards _ from the fm limit . ) indeed , we observe that the high - energy end of each polyad consists of twofold subclusters and the low - energy end consists of threefold subclusters .    we see a pattern of fine structure ( presumably tunnel splittings ) which is just like the pattern in the four - spin problem.@xcite namely , throughout each polyad the degeneracies of successive levels follow the pattern ( 2,1,1,2 ) and repeat .",
    "( here  as also for regime 3  every `` 2 '' level has @xmath120 and every `` 1 '' level has @xmath121 , where wavenumber @xmath122 was defined in sec .  [ subsec - diagonalize ] .",
    ") numerical data show that ( independent of @xmath0 ) the pattern ( starting from the lowest energy ) begins ( 2112 ... ) for even @xmath107 , but for odd @xmath107 it begins ( 1221 ... ) . in the energy range of twofold subclusters ,",
    "the levels are grouped as ( 2)(11)(2 ) , i.e. one tunnel - split subcluster between two unsplit subclusters(and repeat ) ; in the threefold subcluster regime , the grouping is ( 21)(12 ) , so that each subcluster gets tunnel - split into a pair and a single level , but the sense of the splitting alternates from one subcluster to the next .",
    "an analysis of @xmath123 , @xmath124 showed that the fraction of threefold subclusters indeed grows from around 0.3 for small @xmath107 to nearly @xmath125 at @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath117 and @xmath127 were estimated by the method described near the end of subsec .",
    "[ subsec : polyads ] , they indeed scaled as @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively .",
    "this regime occurs at @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is given by ( [ eq : afmcat ] ) .",
    "that means the classical energy surface is divided into two disconnected pieces , related by a mirror reflection of all three spins in any plane normal to the easy plane .",
    "analogous to regime one , two degenerate antiferromagnetic `` spin waves '' exist around _ either _ energy minimum , and the polyad states are built from the levels of these two oscillators .",
    "thus the clustering hierarchy outlined in sec .",
    "[ subsec : polyads ] ",
    "polyads clusters , ebk - quantization of @xmath109 , and tunneling over barriers of @xmath109 on the polyad phase sphere  is repeated within each disconnected piece , leading to a prediction that _ all _ levels should be twofold degenerate .",
    "consequently , on the level diagram ( figure  [ fig : c3low ] ) , there should be half the apparent level density below the line @xmath132 as above it .",
    "indeed , a striking qualitative change in the apparent level crossing behavior is visible at that line ( shown dashed in the figure ) . actually , _",
    "is possible between the disconnected pieces of the energy surface and may split these degenerate pairs .",
    "in fact this _ hyperfine _ splitting happens to 1/3 of the pairs , again following the ( 2112 ) pattern within a given polyad .",
    "this ( 2112 ) pattern starts to break up as the energy moves away from the afm limit ; even for large @xmath0 ( @xmath133 or @xmath134 ) , this breakup happens already around the polyad with @xmath135 , so it is much harder than in the fm case to ascertain the asymptotic pattern of subclustering .",
    "we conjecture that the breakup may happen near the energies where , classically , the stable periodic orbits bifurcate and a small bit of phase space goes chaotic .",
    "the barrier for tunneling between the disconnected energy surfaces has the energy scale of the bare hamiltonian , which is much larger ( at least , for small @xmath107 ) than the scale of effective hamiltonian @xmath109 which provides the barrier for tunneling among the states in a subcluster .",
    "hence , the hyperfine splittings are tiny compared to the fine splittings discussed at the end of subsection  [ subsec : polyads ] . to analyze numerical results , we replace a degenerate level pair by one level and a hyperfine - split pair by the mean level , and treat the result as the levels from _ one _ of the two disconnected polyad phase spheres , neglecting tunneling to the other one .",
    "then in the afm limit , the `` pole '' points in figure  [ fig : flows ] again correspond to spin waves propagating around the ring , while the stable and unstable points on the equator are ( c ) and ( b ) on figure  [ fig : tracks ] .",
    "the three - phase orbit is the _",
    "highest _ frequency orbit in the afm limit ,  @xcite so again the twofold and threefold subclusters should occur at the high and low energy ends of each polyad cluster . what we observe",
    ", however , is that _ all _ the subclusters are twofold , except the lowest one is often threefold .",
    "this regime will includes only @xmath136 i.e. @xmath137  the same regime in which the flat dos was observed ( sec .",
    "[ sec - flatspot ] ) . above the critical value @xmath25 , the levels behave as in the `` fm limit '' described above .    at @xmath138 , it is well - known that the quantum hamiltonian reduces to @xmath139 $ ] . thus each level has degeneracy @xmath140 .",
    "( that is the number of ways three spins @xmath0 may be added to make total spin @xmath141 , and each such multiplet has one state with @xmath142 . ) when @xmath78 is small , these levels split and will be called a polyad",
    ".  @xcite    classically , at @xmath86 the spins simply precess rigidly around the total spin vector .",
    "these are harmonic motions of four coordinates ; hence the polyad phase sphere can be constructed by ( [ eq : polyad ] ) . from the threefold symmetry",
    ", there should again be three orbit types as represented generically by figure  [ fig : flows ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "for example , an umbrella - like configuration in which the three spin directions are equally tilted out of their plane corresponds to a three - phase type orbit , with two cases depending on the handedness of the arrangement .",
    "a configuration where one spin is parallel / antiparallel to the net moment , and the other two spins offset symmetrically from it ) , follows one of the threefold degenerate orbits .",
    "numerically , the level behavior in the near - isotropic limit is similar to the near - fm limit .",
    "the fine structure degeneracies are a repeat of the ( 2112 ) pattern as in the other regimes ; the lowest levels of any polyad always begin with ( 1221 ) . the fraction of threefold subclusters is large here and , as expected , grows with @xmath0 , ( from 0.5 to 0.7 in the case @xmath143 ) . however , the energy scales of @xmath117 and @xmath127 behave numerically as @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "what is different about the isotropic limit is that the precession frequency  hence the oscillator frequency @xmath91  is not a constant , but is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "since perturbation techniques  @xcite give formulas for @xmath109 with inverse powers of @xmath91 , it is plausible that @xmath113 and @xmath114 in ( [ eq : i ] ) include factors of @xmath146 here , which were absent in the other two regimes .",
    "to summarize , by using detailed knowledge of the classical mechanics of a three spin cluster @xcite , we have studied the semiclassical limit of spin in three ways .",
    "first , using autoregressive spectral analysis , we identified the oscillating contributions that the fundamental orbits of the cluster make to the density of states , in fact , we detected the quantum signature of the orbits before discovering them .",
    "secondly , we verified that the quantum dos is proportional to the area of the energy surface ; we also observed kinks in the smoothed quantum dos , which are the quantum manifestation of topology changes of the classical energy surface ; such topology changes , we expect , are more common in spin systems than particle phase space , since even a single spin has a nontrivial topology . finally , we have identified three regimes of near - regular behavior in which the levels are clustered according to a four - level hierarchy , and we explained many features qualitatively in terms of a reduced , one degree - of - freedom system .",
    "this system appears promising for two extensions analgous to ref .  : tunnel amplitudes ( and their topological phases ) could be computed more explicitly ; also , the low - energy levels from exact diagonalization of a finite piece of the anisotropic - exchange antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice could probably be mapped to three large spins and analyzed in the fashion sketched above in sec .",

    "the classical - quantum correspondence has been studied extensively in this system , but the hamiltonian is time - varying and unlike that of interacting spins ,                  this is an example of the general phenomenon of symmetry - breaking bifurcations of orbits . for a systematic discussion , see m.  a.  m. de  aguiar and c.  p. malta , annals of physics * 180 * , 167 ( 1987 ) ; our case corresponds to ( b ) in their table i.          as ref .",
    "notes , the third - order expansion of the hamiltonian near a ground state is the same for our model ( in the right coordinates ) as for the famous hnon - heiles model ( m.  hnon and c.  heiles , astronomical j. * 69 * , 73 ( 1964 ) ) .",
    "hence , we see similar behaviors near the limit ( e.g. the dependence on excitation energy of the frequency splitting between orbits ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",

    "in fact , the _ classical dynamics _ of our system do scale if one rescales the spin length @xmath0 simultaneously .",
    "however , in contrast to the mentioned scaling systems systems , @xmath0 in a spin system is not just a numerical parameter , but is a discrete quantum number . in effect , constructing an orbit spectrum by varying @xmath0 is a mixture of scaled - energy spectroscopy and inverse-@xmath149 spectroscopy ( see j.  main , c.  jung , and h.  s. taylor , j.  chem .  phys .  *",

    "we expect @xmath109 could be calculated explicitly by some perturbation theory ; it is closely related to the approximate invariants provided by the gustavson normal form construction , or by averaging methods : see _ perturbation methods , bifurcation theory , and computer algebra _ by r.  h. rand and d.  armbruster ( springer , new york , 1987 ) .",
