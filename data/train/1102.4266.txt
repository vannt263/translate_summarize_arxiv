    "currently the search for gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources is conducted with the first - generation earth - based laser interferometers ( ligo in usa @xcite , virgo in italy @xcite , geo-600 in germany @xcite , tama-300 in japan @xcite and aciga in australia @xcite ) .",
    "the development of the second - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , geo - hf @xcite and lcgt @xcite ) is well underway .",
    "the sensitivity of the first - generation detectors is limited by noises sources of various nature : seismic and suspension thermal noise noise at low frequencies ( below @xmath0 hz ) , thermal noise in suspensions , bulks and coatings of the mirrors ( @xmath1 hz ) , photon shot noise ( above @xmath2 hz ) .",
    "it is expected that the sensitivity of the second - generation detectors will be ultimately limited by the noise of quantum nature arising due to heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite over most of the frequency range of interest .",
    "the optimum between measurement noise ( photon shot noise ) and back - action noise ( radiation pressure noise ) is called the standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "this level is expected to be reached in the forthcoming second generation of large - scale laser - interferometric gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "third generation detectors , such as the einstein telescope @xcite aim to significantly surpass the sql over a wide frequency range @xcite .    the most promising methods to overcome the sql rely on the implementation of optical ( ponderomotive ) rigidity @xcite which effectively turns the test masses of a gravitational - wave detector into harmonic oscillators producing a gain in sensitivity @xcite .",
    "in order to understand it note that the formula for the sensitivity @xmath3 of advanced ligo interferometer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : advligo ] ) consists of two terms : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the total single - sided spectral density of the noise recalculated to the strain density @xmath6 of the gravitational wave @xmath7  the value of @xmath5 corresponds to the sql sensitivity for the case of free masses , @xmath8 is the observation frequency , @xmath9 the arm length of the interferometer , @xmath10 is the reduced mass , @xmath11 is the mass of each mirror of the arm cavities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the single - sided spectral densities of the measurement noise and the back action noise , respectively and @xmath14 is the optical rigidity .",
    "the relation between the fourier transforms of the position @xmath15 and the force @xmath16 can be described as @xmath17 . for simplicity",
    "we assume here that the measurement and the back action noise are not correlated .",
    "then the uncertainty relation is given by @xmath18 substituting ( [ sfsx ] ) in form s@xmath19 into ( [ xisq ] ) we can find the minimal value of the sensitivity @xmath3 ( after optimization over @xmath12 ) which is better than the sql @xmath20 in the bandwidth @xmath21 where @xmath22 , i.e. close to optical spring resonance .",
    "in other words a harmonic oscillator provides a gain in sensitivity for near - resonance signals , equal to @xmath23 usually the two resonances are at two separate frequencies .",
    "the gain in sensitivity by means of the optical rigidity was examined in @xcite for the wide - band regime under conditions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the case of so - called _ double resonance _",
    "@xcite , when an sophisticated frequency dependence of the optical rigidity allows us to obtain two close or coinciding resonance frequencies and to get better gain in sensitivity , is described by the following formula : @xmath26 it is important to note that the oscillatory sensitivity gain , described in equation ( [ xi_oscill ] ) does not provide any gain in the signal to noise ratio in case the signal has a bandwidth larger than @xmath27 ( because the signal to noise ratio scales as the sensitivity gain multiplied by the bandwidth @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , for a double resonance configuration with a sensitivity described by equation  ( [ xi_fdrigid ] ) the signal to noise ratio increases with decreasing bandwidth proportional to @xmath28 @xcite . please note that in the advanced ligo configuration optical rigidity can be created easily through microscopic position changes of the signal recycling mirror @xcite as it is already being used in geo600 detector @xcite .",
    "a single optical spring always causes instability .",
    "this can qualitatively be explained @xcite by taking into account that the optical rigidity is not introduced instantaneously , but with a delay of the relaxation time @xmath29 of the optical resonator .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the free mass position @xmath15 with the optical rigidity @xmath30 may approximately be described by the equation @xmath31 expanding the second term in a series @xmath32 we can rewrite the previous equation in the form : @xmath33 obviously , the term @xmath34 corresponds to a negative damping force .",
    "please note that in the opposite case of _ negative _ optical rigidity a _ positive _ damping force is introduced ( the sign of the rigidity correlates with the sign of the detuning ) .",
    "the instability ( negative damping ) can be compensated by incorporating a linear feedback control loop and in the ideal case ( no additional noise is introduced by the feedback ) it would not modify the noise spectrum of a gw detector @xcite .",
    "in practice , however , the need for control gain at frequencies inside the detection band can cause undesirable complexity in the control system or can introduce additional classical noise .    an alternative way to suppress the instability was proposed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite , by injecting a second carrier field from the bright port ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : advligo ] ) in order to create a relatively small additional negative rigidity component , thus the total rigidity ( of both lasers together ) remains positive , but at the same time introduce a relatively large additional positive damping component to make total damping positive .",
    "the main purpose of the second carrier is to create a second optical spring that forms a stable optical spring together with the first one  even though each individual optical spring , acting alone , would be unstable .",
    "both carriers are assumed to have different polarizations , so that there is no direct coupling between the two fields ( although they both directly couple to the mirrors ) .    in this paper",
    "we further analyze the stability of an optical spring created by a double pump .",
    "the regime of _ stable _ double resonance analyzed in this paper provides the possibility to decrease the bandwidth of the resonance curve dramatically and , hence , to increase the signal to noise ratio even for signals with a wide bandwidth ( as formula ( [ xi_fdrigid ] ) predicts ) . in sec .  [ sop ]",
    "we formulate the simple criterion of stability and we apply it to the regimes of stable double resonance in sec .",
    "in addition we discuss the possibilities to observe these regimes using the experimental setups of the gingin and glasgow prototype interferometers .",

    "( [ condstab ] )",
    ". however , our criterion might be useful to identify configurations that can be experimentally implemented avoiding any feedback or for other interesting regimes such as double resonance or negative inertia @xcite .",
    ".parameters of advanced ligo used in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another experimental setup that can be used to observe a stable double resonance is the glasgow 10 m prototype @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the balanced scheme of a full michelson interferometer such as advanced ligo , where it is possible to pump the interferometer with the _ symmetric _ mode tuned to resonance , while observing the optical rigidity in the _ anti - symmetric _ mode , in the glasgow prototype ( shown on fig .  [",
    "fig : gp ] ) the same mode will have to be used to pump and to observe rigidity . recall that the smaller the detuning the larger is the circulating power , whereas optical rigidity requires a large detuning .",
    "however , it is possible to set the first cavity between prm and i m to anti - resonance ( the relaxation rates @xmath94 reach their minimum ) and to create the detuning by shifting the position of the end mirror . in this situation the equations ( [ notations2 ] ) can be used with @xmath95 . taking into account that practically only the light end mirror can move the power parameters @xmath96 have to be redefined , reduced by factor @xmath52 :    [ pqgl ] @xmath97    then we can apply the scheme presented in appendix  [ doublerapp ] . in particular the stable double resonance is characterised by the following set of dimensionless parameters :    [ drparamgl ] @xmath98    using the actual parameters of the glasgow prototype , as presented in table  [ table : gp ] , we can calculate the following set of experimental parameters : @xmath99 here @xmath100 are the input powers of the two pump lasers .    unfortunately , the observation of a stable double resonance is more difficult for smaller scale experiments .",
    "for example , one may consider an experimental setup as described in @xcite of a short fabry - perot cavity ( without power recycling ) and a light - weight movable mirror : the power transmittance of the input mirror is @xmath101 , the distance between the mirrors is @xmath102  m and the mass of the movable mirror is @xmath103  g. then the dimensionless parameters ( [ drparamgl ] ) can be recalculated as follows : @xmath104 obviously these input power values are impermissibly huge to be realised in an experiment . in order to find some regularities concerning the experiment scale we can rewrite the formula in the following form using the value of input power : @xmath105 where we substitute @xmath106 . for the glasgow prototype",
    "the effective transmittance is equal to @xmath107 .    in order to find out whether an experiment is realizable , we emphasized in expression ( [ pest ] ) only the proportionality to the terms , which significantly change with changes of the experiment scale .",
    "decreasing the scale of the experiment is usually represented by decreasing the mass @xmath11 of the movable mirror and the distance @xmath9 between the mirrors , which approximately compensate each others contribution into @xmath108 .",
    "that means that in order to achieve the needed value of @xmath108 and thus to observe the desired stable double resonance one needs to keep the effective transmittance roughly the same as in a bigger scale experiment due to the strong dependence of @xmath108 on @xmath109 .",
    "this leads to the need for the circulating power to be the same as for the bigger scale experiment , which would be pretty difficult due to problems caused by absorption induced heating of the small mirror .",
    "we developed a new criterion for the stability of an optical spring and applied it to the double resonance scheme .",
    "before such a concept can be realised in a large scale gravitational wave detector it would be beneficial to demonstrate it on a prototype scale experiment , such as the glasgow prototype @xcite , gingin high optical power test facility @xcite or the aei 10 m prototype interferometer @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that our criterion for optical spring stability may also be applied to the negative inertia regime recently proposed by f.ya .",
    "khalili and colleagues @xcite ( the term `` negative inertia '' was proposed earlier by h.  mller - ebhardt @xcite ) .",
    "this directly follows from the fact that the negative inertia scheme formally corresponds to a double resonance configuration with a resonance frequency of zero .",
    "the formulated stability criterion is also valid for gravitational wave detectors pumped by more than two lasers .",
    "this may allow us to realize _ stable triple ( or quadro ) _ resonance , i.e. regimes when three ( or four ) eigen - frequencies coincide or are close to each other . in this case",
    "the response to force at the resonance frequency is greater than for a double resonance configuration . in the frequency domain",
    "the resonant gain for a triple resonance has to be proportional to @xmath110 ( i.e. inverse proportional to the _ third _ power of the bandwidth @xmath111 ) .",
    "it will allow us to further increase the gain in the signal to noise ratio for wide bandwidth signals , mentioned in the introduction , by a factor @xmath112 compared to the double resonance . in this paper",
    "no sensitivity analysis for gravitational detectors was performed , but we plan to do this in a future publication",
    ".    an stable double resonance featuring arbitrarily large susceptibility may allow us to use it for the production of squeezed light by means of the ponderomotive nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "however , the obtained squeezing will have specific features @xcite : one would have to measure two optimal quadratures , corresponding to each carrier , and squeezing can only be observed by finding their correct combination , because they are correlated ( entangled ) through the mechanical degree of freedom .    due to the combination of a uniquely large susceptibility and a low noise level the stable double ( or triple ) resonance may also be applied to macroscopic quantum mechanics experiments with mirrors of relatively small mass . in particular , it can be used for the observation of quantum entanglement between an oscillator and an e.m .",
    "field @xcite or for preparation of the mechanical oscillator in a non - gaussian quantum state @xcite .",
    "in addition stable double resonance may be a useful instrument in other precision measurements , such as the measurements of thermal noise of mirror coatings . in case",
    "the mass @xmath11 of one cavity mirror is small enough compared to the other one , the equation for the variation @xmath113 of the optical distance inside the cavity may be written in the frequency domain as follows : @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the thermal fluctuations of the mirror surface in respect to the mirror s center of mass and @xmath116 is the back action force .",
    "homodyne detection of the output wave yields the information on @xmath113 .",
    "one can obtain resonant gain of the signal ( in this case it is @xmath115 ) inside the resonance bandwidth ( i.e. for @xmath117 ) and in case of a stable double resonance this gain is unusually large .",

    "first we assume the two smaller roots of @xmath80 to be close enough to each other .",
    "that means that the function @xmath80 can be expressed in form @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the distance between the close roots ( and @xmath121 is small ) .",
    "we also introduce the parameter @xmath122 which is defined as the distance between the center of the two close roots and the `` lonely '' root .",
    "proper substitution transforms this cubic function into the reduced form @xmath123 . in our case",
    "the substitution is @xmath124 .",
    "the particular case of this equation with @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 is the middle of the close roots in terms of the shifted variable ) leads us to the following equation : @xmath128    after the substitution is done the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 are expressed in terms of @xmath131 and @xmath132 as follows : @xmath133    on the other hand the function @xmath80 is expressed in terms of the input parameters such as the pump powers and the detunings ( parameters @xmath134 ) .",
    "substitution of @xmath135 transforms the function into the familiar form @xmath123 .",
    "however , this time the coefficients @xmath129 and @xmath130 are expressed in terms of the above mentioned input parameters .    equating the pairs of expressions for @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( expressed in different terms )",
    "one can obtain the solutions for the pump powers @xmath108 and @xmath136 as functions of the remaining input parameters as well as @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    at this step the @xmath15-arrangement of the function @xmath80",
    "is completed . indeed ,",
    "if we set a certain value of @xmath132 we can expect the middle of the close roots ( in the shifted variables ) to be equal to @xmath137 . setting a certain value of @xmath131 results in the close roots to be separated by @xmath138 .",
    "the next step is to arrange @xmath83 thus it provides stability of the complex frequencies .",
    "according to the stability criterion   frequencies are expected to be stable if the roots of @xmath80 ( @xmath139 ) and @xmath83 ( @xmath140 ) are located in the same way as is shown on fig .",

    "we obtained three stable frequencies , two of which are separated by the desired distance of @xmath138 .",
    "it is obvious that in order to obtain a single resonance peak , one should choose a distance between the close frequencies smaller than the mean imaginary part of these roots @xmath88 . since @xmath145 , the distance between the close frequencies can be estimated as @xmath146 .",
