    "we explore the dynamics of lysogenic phage in a bacterial biofilm , for bacterial hosts both with and without crispr immunity .",
    "classical models of phage - bacteria interactions have previously demonstrated that lysogeny can promote the stable co - existence of bacteria and phage @xcite . in agreement with these findings ,",
    "model 1 explores the baseline conditions under which lysogeny exists in a biofilm , and provides conditions for the stability of a lysogenic equilibrium .",
    "the second and third models demonstrate the powerful effect of the crispr - cas system in comparison with the non - crispr bacterial population in the first model .",
    "the second model predicts that at realistic parameter values , only prophage - free crispr - immune bacteria stably survive in a bacterial biofilm . in rare cases ,",
    "the crispr system stably co - exists with the phage , however the crispr system does not allow lysogens to co - exist at this equilibrium . in the third model , there is no crispr system present in the lysogens . in the absence of an external source of lysogens ( case ( a ) ) , crispr - immune bacteria are predicted to dominate the biofilm .",
    "however if an external source of planktonic lysogens contributes to the biofilm , crispr bacteria may co - exist with lysogens or can even be eliminated from the biofilm .",
    "this last result is of clinical relevance because crispr bacteria are highly resistant to phage therapy .",
    "once crispr bacteria are removed from the biofilm , phage therapy has a much higher chance of success .",
    "the existence and stability conditions were found analytically to define the parametric regions in which populations exist or remain stable . in order to visualize the population behaviour in the biologically meaningful parameter space ,",
    "computer simulations were used to verify the stability conditions .",
    "in addition , parametric analysis was used to explore realistic parameter regimes , and to define therapeutic strategies to eradicate crispr - immune bacteria from the biofilm .",
    "these results indicate that large magnitude changes in any one baseline parameter value would be required to achieve that objective .",
    "this suggests that means of varying several parameters simultaneously might hold more therapeutic promise .    in the first model ,",
    "the lysogenic equilibrium is typically stable for realistic parameter values .",
    "this equilibrium ( le@xmath5 ) loses stability when @xmath17 .",
    "if we consider the sloughing off rate @xmath11 and prophage induction rate @xmath9 to be negligible compared to the growth rate @xmath18 , then this condition reduces to @xmath19 or @xmath20 which ensures the stability of pfe@xmath5 . in between the regions of stability of le@xmath5 and pfe@xmath5",
    ", there is a small region of length @xmath9 where aee@xmath5 exists .",
    "although the biological relevance of this region is arguable , we provide some numerical explorations in figure [ fig : limitcycle ] .",
    "the second model predicts that the crispr response is sufficiently strong to eliminate lysogens , and therefore crispr - immune bacteria dominate the biofilm over a wide range of parameter values . at high infection rates ( i.e. @xmath21 ) , assuming the sloughing off rate is negligible compared to the bacterial growth rate , a stable crispr equilibrium ce@xmath6 exists .",
    "this predicts that the phage may exist at high adsorption rates , while lysogen survival is unlikely unless the death probability @xmath22 goes to zero and sloughing off rates @xmath23 and @xmath11 become equal .",
    "these two conditions would only hold in the unlikely scenario that the crispr system has no effect on the lysogens .",
    "the third model explored the case of non - crispr lysogens and crispr - immune non - lysogens . at baseline",
    "parametric values , the lysogens are predicted to go extinct , while the crispr - immune bacteria stably exist inside the biofilm . in some more extreme parameter regimes , lysogens also persist at equilibrium .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues show that the stability of le@xmath7 and pfe@xmath7 have almost complementary conditions , although a small region of bi - stability exists , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "case ( b ) of model 3 was specifically designed to explore the possibility of using lysogens to penetrate the biofilm and reduce the population of crispr - immune bacteria",
    ". a high rate of biofilm formation is necessary to eliminate crispr - immune bacteria @xmath0 in this case ; both lysogens and phage are always present in the biofilm because of their continuous influx through flow .",
    "although our model treats only one type of virus and corresponding prophage , an interesting possibility here is that diverse prophage could be introduced via the lysogens joining the biofilm . in this way",
    ", lysogens could produce a number of different viruses via induction , and this could ultimately reduce the entire biofilm population .",
    "since older crispr spacers in the bacteria become less efficient , the possibility of crispr failure increases with phage diversity , which helps to eradicate crispr - immune bacteria @xmath0 .",
    "once crispr bacteria have been eliminated , the biofilm can be treated by classical therapeutic techniques .",
    "although the arguments above are highly speculative , the main results of our research are summarized in figure [ fig : all_model ] which is divided into four panels ( vertical lines ) . on the left ,",
    "we use model 2 to simulate a pathogenic biofilm that is resistant to phage therapy because it consists entirely of crispr - immune bacteria . in the second panel , an external , possibly therapeutic source of planktonic lysogens",
    "is applied , and the all existing equilibrium state emerges . when the concentration of lysogens in the external source is further increased ( 3rd panel ) ,",
    "the crispr - immune bacteria are eradicated from the biofilm and the model shows the same behaviour as model 1 with only lysogens and phage surviving . at realistic baseline parameters , the lysogenic equilibrium emerges . once the crispr population has been eliminated , the external source of lysogens can be removed and models 3 and 1 are equivalent .",
    "variations in a number of parameter values can then be used to eliminate the lysogens ( panel 4 ) .",
    "for example , as mentioned above , diversity in the prophages carried by lysogens could produce a number of distinct phage populations inside the biofilm , which could infect bacteria and also increase the prophage induction rate . extending the analysis presented here to include multiple phage types is an intriguing possibility for future work .     in the second and third panels respectively . in the fourth panel ,",
    "simulations of model 1 are presented for baseline parameters ( top two curves ) and for varied parameters based on possible therapy , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , ( bottom two curves with increased line - width ) .",
    "the dashed lines represent @xmath0 , dash - dot lines represent @xmath1 in model 2 , and @xmath3 in model 1 and 3 , whereas dots symbolize the population density of phage @xmath4 . ]",

    "the stability of the steady states are very similar to those observed in the above parameter analyses . in general",

    "<S> the simulations are run over long times to illustrate stable equilibrium states , and in each case the numerical results were validated by comparison with the analytical expressions . </S>",
    "<S> we plot both population densities and time on a log axis , such that initial transients are visible .    in the first model , </S>",
    "<S> the baseline scenario produces a stable lysogenic equilibrium ( without crispr ) , in which the phage population is maintained in the biofilm through induction . </S>",
    "<S> this is a classical model which supports the idea of co - existence of temperate phage and their bacterial hosts . </S>",
    "<S> this result should generalize to the case of many phage types , since bacteria are capable of carrying several prophage as part of their genome .    in the second model , the crispr bacteria @xmath0 </S>",

    "<S> the crispr effects on the lysogens @xmath1 , i.e. the death of lysogens or increase in the sloughing - off rate , make it possible to eliminate these infected bacteria from the biofilm ; their loss is followed by the loss of the phage population . </S>",
    "<S> the second model demonstrates that crispr systems will disrupt the coexistence observed in model 1 , and predicts that for bacteria with crispr systems , stable biofilms are likely to be composed of crispr - immune bacteria only .    </S>",
    "<S> the populations in the first two models reach stable equilibria fairly quickly , whereas simulation results for the third model show that the populations take longer to reach their stable states . in the absence of an external source of lysogens ( model 3a ) , </S>",
    "<S> crispr - immune bacteria dominate , since the crispr system helps the bacteria to maintain the phage - free equilibrium after eliminating non - crispr lysogens from the biofilm . when the external source of lysogens is present ( model 3b ) , we observe stability of the all existing equilibrium for these baseline parameter values . this is because a high biofilm formation rate is required to meet the sufficient condition for the stability of le@xmath2 , thus eliminating the crispr cells from the biofilm . to investigate this further </S>",

    "<S> variation in the adsorption rate constant affects the stability of equilibrium states by varying @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : beta ] shows that le@xmath5 remains stable for a wide range of @xmath8 values in model 1 , while the other models each switch stability between two equilibrium states at high rates of adsorption . in model 2 , pfe@xmath6 is replaced by ce@xmath6 at high adsorption rates . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the strong immune response of crispr bacteria , such that even for high adsorption rates crispr - immune bacteria survive , co - existing with the phage .    in model 3 , </S>",
    "<S> le@xmath6 is stable at high @xmath8 , replacing pfe@xmath7 in case ( a ) and aee@xmath2 in case ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the biofilm formation rate @xmath12 does not have a strong influence here , since almost same adsorption rate @xmath8 is required in both cases to eradicate crispr - immune bacteria .    </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , these results demonstrate that for biofilms without crispr systems ( model 1 ) , lysogens and phage are predicted to coexist over a wide parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for biofilms with crispr ( model 2 ) , the stable equilibrium state is typically dominated by crispr - immune bacteria . if crispr - capable lysogens are replaced by lysogens without a functioning crispr system ( model 3 , a and b ) , again crispr - immune bacteria typically dominate , although for parameter regimes that are extremely favourable to phage reproduction , the lysogenic equilibrium may be stable . as shown in appendix s4 , these qualitative conclusions also hold for variations in parameters @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 .     in the above models . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , an increase in the value of @xmath9 and @xmath16 require an increase in the value of @xmath12 to make the lysogenic equilibrium stable , whereas an increase in the sloughing off rate @xmath11 reduces the threshold value of @xmath12 .     in the model 3 ( case ( b ) ) . </S>",
