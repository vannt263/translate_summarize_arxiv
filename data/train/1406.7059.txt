    "a torsion - bar antenna ( toba ) is a gravitational - wave ( gw ) detector with two bar - shaped test masses which rotate differentially by the tidal force of gws @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the toba is that it has good sensitivity at low frequencies around 1 hz even on the ground because of its low resonant frequency of the test masses in the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "other ground - based detectors such as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite and kagra @xcite are sensitive to gws only above about 10 hz .",
    "the test masses of interferometers do not behave as free masses and the seismic noise is not reduced below 10 hz since the resonant frequency of the pendulum mode is higher than that of torsional mode . though space - borne gw detectors such as evolved laser interferometer space antenna ( elisa ) @xcite and deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite are sensitive at low frequencies , such space missions need several decades to be launched .",
    "toba is the possible way to detect low - frequency gws with less time and fewer costs .",
    "the main observational targets of a toba are gws from binaries of intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) and pulsars .",
    "the individual imbhs have not been directly detected yet , though there are several evidences for the existence of imbhs such as ultraluminous x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the direct detection of imbhs is important to understand the evolution of smbhs and galaxies .",
    "long period pulsars whose rotational period are of the order of 1 - 10 seconds such as psr j2144 - 3933 @xcite are also interesting targets .",
    "it is necessary to estimate binary parameters or pulsar parameters such as their masses , spin rate and direction , from gw signals for revealing the nature of the imbhs and the neutron stars if the signal has been detected .",
    "however , it is difficult to measure the gw waveform parameters and the direction of the source with a single - detector observation when the observation time is not long enough to use the effect of the spin of the earth because the conventional gw detectors do not have good directivity .",
    "estimating the direction of the gw sources enables us to perform complementary observations with electro - magnetic waves which would provide us more detailed information .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new observational configuration for toba to improve the accuracy of the parameter estimation , the angular resolution and event detection rates without changing the setup drastically .",
    "we can obtain three independent signals by monitoring not only horizontal rotation of the test mass , but also its vertical rotations .",
    "since these three signals have different responses to gws in such a way that they compensate their blind directions each other , the detection volume is enlarged and the detection rate is improved . furthermore , the waveform parameters can be determined with a single toba even though the observation time is shorter than a day .",
    "it will enable us to derive more information about gw sources with less detectors .",
    "the rest of this paper is composed as follows .",
    "we present the details of our antenna configuration and the antenna pattern functions in section [ sec : obs_method ] . in section [ sec : para_resol ] , we show the accuracy of the parameter estimation evaluated by the fisher analysis for both monochromatic sources and binary coalescences . summary and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "toba is a gravitational - wave antenna with two orthogonal bar - shaped test masses . in the presence of gw signal @xmath0 ,",
    "the bars are subjected to the tidal force of gws and rotate .",
    "then they work as test masses for gw detection above the resonant frequency . the horizontal angular motion of the test mass 1 shown in fig . [ fig : bar ]",
    ", @xmath1 obeys the equation of motion @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the moment of inertia , dissipation coefficient and spring constant in the rotational degree of freedom , and the dynamic quadrupole moment of the horizontal rotational mode @xcite , respectively .",
    "then , toba has sensitivity to gws above the resonant frequency @xmath5 .",
    "when we assume that the each bar is suspended by two wires , the estimated example sensitivity curve and its parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] and table [ tbl : params ] .",
    "note that the spring constant @xmath6 is derived by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gravity acceleration , @xmath9 is the distance between the two wires , and @xmath10 is the length of the suspension wires .    schematic picture of toba in the proper antenna frame .",
    "the test masses rotate in the horizontal plane ( @xmath1 and @xmath11 ) and in the vertical planes ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) due to the tidal force of gws . ]",
    ".[tbl : params]parameters of toba used for the estimated sensitivity curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have presented a new gravitational - wave ( gw ) antenna configuration with a triple - output toba and investigated its performance .",
    "previously a single - output toba which monitors the angular motions caused by gws only on the horizontal plane had been presented .",
    "we have developed the antenna configuration by adding two other outputs which are given by the angular motions on the vertical planes .",
    "thus the gravitational wave signals can be readout from the small rotation of the bars on the @xmath14-@xmath15 , @xmath15-@xmath16 and @xmath16-@xmath14 planes as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar ] .",
    "we derive the antenna pattern functions of the triple - output toba including the effect of the earth s motion and obtain eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f+ ] ) and ( [ eq : fx ] ) .",
    "the antenna pattern power is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : antennapower ] , which shows the triple - output toba has no blind direction and is sensitive to gws from all directions .",
    "its detection event rates is better than the single - output configuration by a factor of about 1.7 .",
    "we also analyze the accuracies of waveform parameters , focusing on the accuracy of the source location on the sky , for the two nominal sources , monochromatic sources and binary coalescences . for long - duration signals ,",
    "the triple - output toba can be treated as the same way as the conventional single - output toba apart from the improved @xmath17 , as expected .",
    "so the advantage of the triple outputs is merely the accumulation of the @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the triple - output toba can break the degeneracy of two polarization modes from short - duration signals even with a single antenna , it improves the paramter estimation errors drastically compared with the single - output toba .",
    "thus , the detection method using a triple - output toba we proposed would be a powerful tool to search for short - duration signals such as a coalescing binary .    as a future work , it is interesting to investigate potential of triple - output tobas for testing gravitational theories with gws",
    ". generally , alternative theories of gravity allow gws to have more independent polarization modes up to six @xcite .",
    "while several conventional interferometric detectors are required to separate a mixture of polarization modes of a gw in detector outputs , triple - output tobas may be able to put constraints on the non - tensorial modes with less antennas because three independent signals can be extracted from each toba .",
    "in addition , this work is considered to be applicable not only for the gw detection but also for a prompt earthquake detection @xcite .",
    "toba is sensitive to the gravity gradient caused by the earthquake . using two triple - output tobas ,",
    "the origin of the earthquake can be determined .",
    "therefore , the big earthquake can be alerted much earlier since the earthquake signal travels faster by the gravity gradient than by the seismic motion .",
