    "a great deal of attention is currently being devoted to examining the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies @xmath6 extracted from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite and other cmb data  @xcite .",
    "decomposing the temperature in spherical harmonics @xmath7 and deducing the angular power spectrum @xmath8 as a function of @xmath0 allows cosmologists to fit the parameters of cosmological models to unprecedented accuracy , possibly even probing the physics of the inflationary epoch .",
    "similarly , the power spectrum of the temperature - polarization cross - correlation function is teaching us about the physics of the reionization of the universe , presumably by the first generation of stars ; and the power spectrum of the temperature - galaxy cross - correlation function is teaching us about the statistical distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "but does the only physics lie in the angular power spectra ? is the sky statistically isotropic , so that any variation in the values of the individual multipole moments @xmath2 with fixed @xmath0 represents only statistical fluctuations , or could there be subtle correlations between the @xmath2 ? if the sky is statistically isotropic , is it gaussian  are the @xmath2 of each fixed @xmath0 drawn from a gaussian distribution of variance that is only @xmath0-dependent ? are there other interesting deviations from the simplest picture ?    in the standard inflationary cosmology",
    "the answer to the question just posed is that in the linear regime , _",
    "i.e. _  at low @xmath0 , the @xmath2 are realizations of gaussian random variables of zero mean , with variances that depend only on @xmath0 ( statistical isotropy ) .",
    "this paradigm is so strongly believed , both because of considerable observational evidence and considerable theoretical prejudice , that relatively little ( though some , e.g.  @xcite ) attention has been paid to searches for deviations from statistical isotropy .    in this paper",
    "we set out to search for one particular deviation ",
    "special directions on the sky .",
    "we do this by first constructing from each multipole moment @xmath9 of the cmb sky a set of @xmath0 unit vectors @xmath10 and a scalar @xmath11 that completely characterize that multipole .",
    "we then examine the correlations between pairs of such sets of vectors , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , comparing them with monte carlo simulations of cmb skies with statistically isotropic gaussian random @xmath2 . if the sky is statistically isotropic with gaussian random @xmath2 , @xmath14 .",
    "since the @xmath15 depend only on the @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath17 should be uncorrelated for @xmath18 .",
    "we constructed these vectors for @xmath19 for a set of full - sky maps including the wmap internal linear combination  ( ilc )  @xcite , and the wmap map as cleaned by tegmark _",
    "et al . _",
    "we applied four statistical tests to the set of vectors from these full - sky maps .",
    "we find that one of the tests is inconsistent with the hypothesis of statistical isotropy and gaussianity at the 99% confidence level .",
    "this work complements recent work by eriksen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite looking at north - south asymmetries in n - point functions , work by park @xcite looking at genus curves , work by hajian _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using the so - called @xmath20 test @xcite which finds violations of statistical isotropy for @xmath21 , and work by vielva _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using the spherical mexican hat wavelet technique where they found a strong signal for non - gaussianity .",
    "tests of non - gaussianity , as opposed to statistical isotropy , have a long and rich history .",
    "motivation for those tests originally came from the realization that non - gaussianity is a signature of structure formation by topological defects  @xcite , while inflation predicts gaussian cmb anisotropies .",
    "subsequently it has been realized that , even if inflation seeded the structure in the universe , cmb non - gaussianity may be present as a signature of features in the inflationary model  @xcite . finally , late - time processes in the universe will induce non - gaussianity on small scales @xcite .",
    "the tests of non - gaussianity include studies of the bispectrum and skewness  @xcite , trispectrum  @xcite , minkowski functionals and the genus statistic  @xcite , spherical wavelets  @xcite , a combination of these  @xcite , and many other methods  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest was the claim for non - gaussianity in the cobe 4-year data  @xcite , but this was shown to be an artifact of a particular known systematic  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , efforts to test the gaussianity of the cmb continue , and most , though not all ( e.g.  @xcite ) , have so far given results entirely in agreement with the gaussian hypothesis .",
    "as these previous studies have shown , it is a challenge to test such fundamental assumptions as statistical isotropy and gaussianity without theoretical direction on what deviations to expect  they can be violated in a very large number of ways each of which could easily be hidden from the test that was actually performed .",
    "an instructive example is the effects on the cmb of any non - trivial topology of the universe , for example a universe which is a 3-torus .",
    "if the length scale of cosmic topology ( for example the length of the smallest non - trivial closed curve ) is sufficiently short , this will manifest itself in various two - point temperature - temperature correlations , such as the so - called  circles - in - the - sky \" signature @xcite : if there are closed paths shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface , then the last scattering surface will self - intersect along circles . these circles can be viewed by an observer from both sides  from one side in one direction on the sky , and from the other side in some other direction .",
    "the temperature as a function of location around the circle as seen from the two sides will be very strongly correlated .",
    "one can therefore search for such pairs of circles .",
    "a definitive direct search is currently being conducted by the original proponents of the signature . however , for us this example serves to show precisely why it is so difficult to perform a comprehensive test of statistical isotropy and gaussianity .",
    "the topology - induced temperature correlations are strong only on or very near the matched circle pairs , thus the multipole coefficients @xmath2 , and other statistics that are weighted averages over the entire sky , would be poor tools for searching for such circles . thus testing these phenomena",
    "is in part a matter of continually searching for ( preferably ) physically motivated ways in which they manifest .",
    "the cmb data itself may provide motivation for searching for deviations from the standard inflationary predictions ( of statistical isotropy and gaussianity ) , especially at large angular scales .",
    "an absence of large angular scale correlations in the cmb sky relative to the inflationary prediction was first noted by cobe dmr in their first year data @xcite , which showed what was reported as an anomalously low quadrupole , @xmath22 .",
    "because the cosmic variance in the quadrupole is quite large , it was widely dismissed as a statistical anomaly .",
    "the result persisted and was strengthened by the cobe dmr four year data  @xcite .",
    "the recent wmap analysis shows a marked absence of power on scales extending from @xmath23 to @xmath24 to an extent that can not be explained solely by a low quadrupole  @xcite .",
    "note that the estimator used by the wmap team has been shown to be non - optimal when applied to incomplete maps of the sky .",
    "when an alternative estimator is applied  @xcite or a full - sky map is analyzed  @xcite the discrepancy becomes less significant .",
    "an absence of power on large scales is expected in some topologically non - trivial universes . in a compact universe",
    "there is a spectral cutoff of long wavelength modes leading to a suppression of power near this cutoff",
    ". one method of looking for such a cutoff is the `` circles - in - the - sky '' signature as noted above . in general , such compact topologies would lead to `` special directions '' in the universe . to search for special directions",
    "we need a method of defining our directions .",
    "our definition , as discussed in the next section , is to decompose the @xmath25 multipole into @xmath0 unit vectors , these vectors are then studied to search for peculiar alignments .",
    "these vectors contain the full information of the @xmath2 but encode it in a different way that allows for one to more easily look for special directions .",
    "in particular , the components of these vectors are non - linear combinations of the @xmath2 ( for a fixed @xmath0 ) .",
    "one attempt to look at the statistical isotropy of the cmb on large scales was the analysis of the quadrupole and octupole moments of the wmap sky by de oliveira - costa _ et al . _",
    "they found that the quadrupole was unusually small , and that the octupole was unusually planar and unusually aligned with the quadrupole .",
    "they identified an axis with each multipole by finding , for each @xmath0 , the axis @xmath26 around which the angular momentum dispersion @xmath27 is maximized .",
    "( here @xmath28 are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the cmb map in a coordinate system with its z - axis in the @xmath26 direction . )",
    "they found that the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 directions : @xmath31 are unusually aligned  their dot product is @xmath32 .",
    "this has only a @xmath33 in @xmath34 chance of happening if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are uncorrelated and the dot product is uniformly distributed on the sky .",
    "de oliveira - costa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite point out that these values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 could be explained by a universe which has a compact direction parallel to @xmath29 and @xmath30 and of length approximately equal to the horizon radius ; but this is ruled out by other tests , including the absence of matched circles in these directions .",
    "it has been noticed that the quadrupole and the octupole in the cleaned wmap skies remain dominated by a hot and a cold spot in the galactic plane ",
    "one in the general direction of the galactic center , and the other in the general direction of the molecular cloud in taurus .",
    "this raises the possibility that the observed correlation is dominated by foreground contamination .",
    "one would like therefore to examine in more detail the correlations between the @xmath2 corresponding to possible preferred directions , or correlations in directions between the various multipoles .",
    "the question then is how best to associate directions with the cmb multipoles .",
    "de oliveira - costa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite associated only one direction with each multipole , corresponding to two real degrees of freedom , whereas the @xmath2 of a given @xmath0 have @xmath35 real degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath25 multipole , @xmath36 , in the multipole expansion of a function @xmath37 on a sphere @xmath38 can be fully represented by a symmetric , traceless rank @xmath0 tensor , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "such a tensor can readily be constructed from the outer product of @xmath0 unit vectors , @xmath41 , and a single scalar , @xmath11 .",
    "( strictly speaking these are headless vectors , i.e.  points on the projective two - sphere .",
    "the sign of each vector can always be absorbed by the scalar .",
    "the sign of the scalar takes on physical signficance when we define a convention for the multipole vectors , such as , all of them point in the northern hemisphere . )      the correspondence between these vectors and the usual multipole coefficients can readily be seen for a dipole .",
    "a dipole defines a direction in space  the line along which the dipole lies .",
    "the standard correspondence is @xmath42 thus @xmath43    & = & a^{(1)}(\\hat v^{(1,1)}_x , \\hat v^{(1,1)}_y , \\hat v^{(1,1)}_z ) \\cdot ( \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi , \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi , \\cos\\theta)\\nonumber \\\\[0.2 cm ]     & \\equiv & a^{(1)}\\hat v^{(1,1 ) } \\cdot \\hat e,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates .",
    "for a real valued function , the vector s components are found to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( which can then be used to construct the unit vector , @xmath47 ) .    to extend this to the @xmath25 multipole",
    ", we want to write heuristically that @xmath48 for each of the @xmath0 directions given by @xmath44 .",
    "this can not be quite right since the product of @xmath0 vectors would contain not only components of angular momentum @xmath0 , but also of angular momenta @xmath49 , @xmath50 , _",
    "etc_. however , a simple power - counting shows that , once the reality conditions have been imposed on @xmath51 , @xmath0 unit vectors and a scalar contain the same number of degrees of freedom as does @xmath51 , namely , @xmath52 ) real degrees of freedom .",
    "we therefore expect that the components of lower angular momentum found in the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : heuristic ] ) are not independent .",
    "we shall see this explicitly in equations ( [ eqn : peel ] ) and ( [ eqn : system ] ) below , and more elegantly in section [ secn : elegant ] . for now , let us treat equation ( [ eqn : heuristic ] ) as motivation and proceed .    instead of solving ( [ eqn : heuristic ] ) directly for all @xmath53 we peel off one vector at a time , finding first a vector @xmath54 ( with components @xmath55 ) , and a rank @xmath56 symmetric , traceless tensor , @xmath57 .",
    "we can think of @xmath58 as running over @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , or more conveniently over @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , we can write @xmath57 as a @xmath64 ( @xmath65 terms ) matrix , @xmath66 ; however , this hides its traceless , symmetric nature and makes it appear that @xmath57 has far more independent degrees of freedom than it actually does .",
    "it is therefore more instructive to write the @xmath67 independent components as @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "we repeat this procedure recursively on the remaining symmetric , traceless tensor from the previous step .",
    "thus we next peel from @xmath57 a vector , @xmath70 , and a rank @xmath49 symmetric , traceless tensor @xmath71 , and repeat until we have found the full set of @xmath0 vectors , @xmath72 .",
    "the scalar @xmath11 , is found in the last step when the second to last vector @xmath73 is peeled off . in this case",
    "the remaining symmetric , traceless tensor , @xmath74 is rank @xmath33 , and is just the product of the final unit vector @xmath75 and the scalar @xmath11 .    to apply the recursive procedure outlined above we use the following recursion relation to peel off one vector @xmath76 for @xmath77 where @xmath78 for a given @xmath0 we peel off a vector using @xmath79 and that @xmath80 the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : peel ] ) , is required to guarantee that this rank @xmath56 tensor is traceless . in other words",
    ", it subtracts off the trace .",
    "we can see this is necessary from the @xmath81 term in the recursion relation  ( [ eqn : recursion ] ) .",
    "the presence of this @xmath49 term is as anticipated in the discussion following equation ( [ eqn : heuristic ] )    plugging in the recursion relation  ( [ eqn : recursion ] ) yields @xmath82 coupled quadratic equations that must be solved for the @xmath82 unknowns : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . from them",
    "we find @xmath86 these equations are easily solved numerically , though see appendix  [ app : vectordecomp ] .",
    "notice that , again as anticipated below equation ( [ eqn : heuristic ] ) , the components , @xmath85 are not relevant for further calculations ; they are functions of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 and are not independent .",
    "this means that the vectors @xmath89 we calculate are indeed unique as claimed .",
    "the general procedure now follows : from the given @xmath2 we construct @xmath54 and @xmath90 .",
    "we continue using @xmath90 to find @xmath70 and @xmath91 .",
    "this is repeated until we find @xmath92 which gives the final two vectors @xmath93 and @xmath75 .",
    "the result of this -procedure for the cmb is shown in figure  [ fig : mpvectors ] .          in practice",
    "we have implemented the procedure described above ( appendix  [ app : vectordecomp ] ) and solved the set of equations  ( [ eqn : vectordecomp ] ) for the analysis we have performed . a mathematically more sophisticated decomposition procedure that leads to the same set of vectors without the need to calculate",

    "thus , given @xmath114 calculated from the sky , equation ( [ eqn : newpeel ] ) is a sequence of @xmath35 coupled quadratic equations for the @xmath41 ( and @xmath11 ) analogous to equation ( [ eqn : peel ] ) , in which the @xmath115 have been eliminated .",
    "with the actual full - sky cmb maps , such as those that we use , the main source of error is pixel noise which accounts for the imperfections in measured temperature on the sky .",

    "we can only test for features that we specify in advance . here",
    "our general goal is to test the statistical isotropy of the map and search for any preferred directions .",
    "our motivation to devise and apply tests of statistical isotropy comes from findings that the quadrupole and octupole moments of wmap maps lie in the plane of the galaxy as discussed previously .",
    "one could in principle extend this and ask whether any higher multipoles lie preferentially in this ( or any other ) plane , and devise a statistic to test for this alignment . clearly , the number of tests one can devise is very large .",
    "here we would like to be as general as possible , and choose tests that suit our multipole vector representation . we choose to consider the dot product of multipole vectors between two different multipoles as described below .",
    "a dot product of two unit vectors is a natural measure of their closeness .",
    "one test we consider is dot products between all vectors from the multipole @xmath138 with those from the multipole @xmath139 . since our vectors are really `` sticks ''",
    "( i.e. each vector is determined only up to a flip @xmath140 ) , we always use the absolute value of a dot product .",
    "furthermore , motivated by the fact that the wmap quadrupole and octupole are located in the same plane and that their axes of symmetry are only about 10@xmath141 of each other  @xcite , we also consider using the cross - products of multipole vectors of any given multipole : if the vectors of @xmath138 and @xmath139 lie in a preferred plane , their respective cross products are oriented near a common axis perpendicular to the plane .",

    "the first big surprise comes from the cross - cross ranks : the @xmath191 rank is @xmath192 .",
    "this means that only 6 out of 50,000 mc generated maps had a higher likelihood than the wmap map ! in other words , the @xmath193 cross - cross dot products computed for this pair from wmap lie unusually near the peaks of their respective histograms , which , recall , are built out of 100,000 products from mc map realizations . _ the violation of statistical isotropy and/or gaussianity therefore manifests itself by a particular correlation between the vectors which makes the statistic @xmath173 `` unusually usual''_. since we checked that the distribution of monte - carlo generated @xmath191 cross - cross ranks is uniform in the interval @xmath183 $ ] , it is easy to see that the probability of this rank being this high ( or higher ) is @xmath194 , or @xmath195% . admittedly , we checked @xmath196 such cross - cross ranks , which raises the probability of find such a result to @xmath197% .",
    "if we include all vector - vector , vector - cross , cross - cross and oriented area ranks , the probability rises to a still rather low @xmath198% .",
    "note that this effect is very different from the now - familiar orientation of the quadrupole and octupole axes ; the quadrupole - octupole alignment is quite _ unlikely _ and results in multipole vector products which preferentially fall on the tails of their respective histograms .",
    "this is confirmed by the actual ranks for ( @xmath199 ) and ( @xmath200 ) multipole vector - cross products , and also the ( @xmath199 ) cross - cross and oriented area products , all of which are fairly low ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "this is easy to understand : in the cross - cross product case , for example , the fact that the multipole vectors lie mostly in the galaxy plane implies that their cross products are roughly perpendicular to this plane .",

    "to this end , we generate 10,000 additional mc gaussian random maps and compute @xmath184 for each .",
    "it turns out that only 107 of them produce @xmath184 lower than the wmap value in  ( [ eq : wmap_q ] ) .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_dotcross_final ] , which also shows the error bars on the wmap @xmath184 .",
    "the probability of wmap oriented area ranks being this high , according to the @xmath184-test , is 1.07% , which corresponds to a 2.6-@xmath203 ( or @xmath204 ) evidence for the violation of statistical isotropy and/or gaussianity . the connection of this ( nearly ) 3-@xmath203 deviation to the nearly 3-@xmath203 deviation represented by the @xmath191 cross - cross rank remains somewhat unclear .",
    "we have performed a few tests to explore the stability of the oriented area result .",
    "first , we have varied the multipole range from the fiducial @xmath205 ; the results are shown in table ii .",
    "increasing the lower limit , @xmath206 , leads to the final probability of @xmath207 and @xmath208 for @xmath209 and 4 respectively .",

    "we use wmap s v - band map of the identified thermal dust ; this map was created by fitting to the template model from ref .",
    "we assume for a moment that 10% of the identified contamination by dust had not been accounted for , and we add it to the cleaned cmb map , i.e. @xmath224 . although we are adding a significant contamination ( the remaining dust is expected to contribute no more than a few percent to the rms cmb temperature  @xcite ) , the high oriented area ranks do not change much ( they actually slightly increase ) , and the gaussian isotropic hypothesis is still ruled out at the 99.3% level . clearly , dust contamination does not explain our results .",
    "further , to mimic remaining foregrounds due to an imperfect cleaning of the map we tested adding a synthetic random gaussian map which contributed 10% of the rms temperature .",
    "we find that the oriented area statistic still disagrees with the gaussian isotropic hypothesis at the 99.4% level .",
    "finally , we have repeated the analysis with several other available full - sky cmb maps . as mentioned earlier , both maps analyzed by tegmark _",
    "et al . _",
    "give the same probability for the oriented area statistic .",
    "for the wmap ilc map we find similarly high ranks , giving an even smaller value for our statistic : @xmath225 , and only 62 mc maps out of 10000 have a smaller value of @xmath184 ; therefore , the high ranks in the ilc map are unlikely at the 99.38% level , corresponding to 2.7-@xmath203 .",
    "does the apparent violation of statistical isotropy or gaussianity that we detected have a cosmological origin , or is it due to foregrounds or measurement error ? the results presented in this paper refer to full - sky maps , and it is known that there are two large cold and two hot spots in the galaxy plane , and that any result that depends on structure in this plane is suspect . nevertheless , it is far from obvious that the result is caused by the contamination in the map for the following reasons :    * as tegmark _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite argue , their cleaned map agrees very well with the ilc map on large scales , although the two were computed using different methods .",
    "the results we presented indicate a violation of isotropy and/or gaussianity at @xmath226 confidence using either map .",
    "furthermore , instrumental noise and beam uncertainties are completely subdominant on these scales . *",
    "the results come from an effect different than the quadrupole and octupole alignment : the latter is fairly _ unlikely _ , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while we see a particular correlation between the vectors that makes our statistic @xmath142 unusually _ likely_. * perhaps most importantly , our results are mostly ( though not completely ) independent of the quadrupole and octupole , multipoles that might be suspect . for example , the second - highest oriented area rank is @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , table  [ tab : l_range ] shows that if we only use the multipoles @xmath228 , the oriented area statistic still rules out the gaussian random hypothesis at the @xmath229 level .    at this time it is impossible to ascertain the origin of the additional correlation between the multipole vectors that we are seeing .",
    "one obvious way to find out more about their origin is to monte carlo generate maps that are non - gaussian or violate the statistical isotropy , according to a chosen prescription , and see whether our statistics , @xmath173 , agree with the @xmath142 computed from mc maps .",
    "of course , there are many different ways in which gaussianity and/or isotropy can be broken , and there is no guarantee that we can find one that explains our results .",
    "another possibility is to cut the galaxy ( or other possible contaminations ) from the map prior to performing the vector decomposition .",
    "there are two approaches we can take : ( 1 ) use the cut - sky @xmath2 to compute the multipole vectors and the statistics @xmath142 and compare those to @xmath142 computed from cut - sky gaussian random maps , or ( 2 ) reconstruct the true full - sky @xmath2 and compare with full - sky gaussian random maps .",
    "the latter procedure is preferred as one would like to work with the true multipole vectors of our universe , but reconstructing the full - sky map from the cut - sky information is a subtle problem that will introduce an additional source of error .",
    "nevertheless , the total error with a @xmath230 cut may still be small enough to allow using the vectors as a potent tool for finding any preferred directions in the universe .",
    "we are actively pursuing these approaches at the present time .    finally , park  @xcite recently tested the full - sky wmap maps using the genus statistic and found evidence for the violation of gaussianity at 23@xmath231 level , depending on the smoothing scale and the chosen aspect of the statistic .",
    "furthermore eriksen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite find that the wmap multipoles with @xmath232 have significantly less power in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere .",
    "it is possible that these results and the effects discussed in this paper have the same underlying cause , but this can not be confirmed without further tests .",
    "the traditional @xmath111 expansion of the sky has many advantages . for one ,",
    "each set of @xmath111 of fixed @xmath0 form an irreducible representation of the rotation group in three dimensions @xmath233 ; for another , more than two centuries of effort have lead to a rich mathematical literature on the @xmath111 , their properties , and how to efficiently calculate them .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath2 of a @xmath111 expansion of a function on the sphere are readily calculated as integrals over the sphere of the function times the @xmath234 . in this paper we have considered a different basis of an equivalent irreducible representations of the proper rotation group , @xmath235  for each @xmath0 , the traceless symmetric product of @xmath0 copies of the unit vector of coordinates @xmath236 .",
    "these are merely linear combinations of the @xmath111 , and so share many of the properties of them , albeit with a more sparse mathematical literature explicitly dedicated to their properties .",
    "in particular the coefficients @xmath237 of a @xmath238 expansion of a function on the sky are , like the spherical harmonic coefficients , calculable as integrals over the sphere of the function times @xmath238 .",
    "we have expressed the @xmath239 as symmetric traceless products of @xmath0 ( headless ) unit vectors @xmath240 and a scalar @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath241 are highly non - linear functions of the @xmath2 .",
    "thus , while in principle they encode the exact same information , they may make certain features of the data more self - evident .",
    "in particular we claim that these `` multipole vectors '' are natural sets of directions to associate with each multipole of the sky .",
    "a code to calculate multiple vectors from cmb skies is available on our website at http://www.phys.cwru.edu / projects / mpvectors/.    we have obtained the multipole vectors of the cmb sky as measured by wmap , as well as the oriented areas defined by all pairs of such vectors ( within a particular multipole ) .",
    "we have examined the hypothesis that the vectors of multipole @xmath0 are uncorrelated with the vectors of multipole @xmath242 for @xmath0 and @xmath242 up to 8 .",
