    "in perturbative qcd the states @xmath3 and @xmath2 are non - relativistic bound states of a charm and an anti - charm quark .",
    "the decays of these states are expected to be dominated by the annihilation of the constituent @xmath4 into three gluons .",
    "the partial width for the decays into an exclusive hadronic state , @xmath5 , is expected to be proportional to the square of the @xmath4 wave function overlap at the origin , which is well determined from the leptonic width  @xcite .",
    "since the strong coupling constant , @xmath6 , is not very different at the @xmath3 and @xmath2 masses , it is expected that for any state @xmath5 the @xmath3 and @xmath2 branching ratios are related by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 denotes a branching fraction , @xmath5 is a particular hadronic final state , and the leptonic branching fractions are taken from the pdg  @xcite .",
    "this relation is sometimes called the 12% rule  .",
    "modest deviations from the rule are expected  @xcite .",
    "although the rule works well for some specific decay modes of the @xmath2 , it fails spectacularly for @xmath2 decays to final states consisting of one vector and one pseudoscalar meson ( vp ) , such as @xmath9 .",
    "values of @xmath10 have been measured for a wide variety of final states  @xcite .",
    "a recent review  @xcite of relevant theory and experiment concludes that current theoretical explanations are unsatisfactory .",
    "clearly more experimental results are desirable .",
    "this paper presents measurements of the following new decay modes of the @xmath2 : @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and more precise measurements of these previously measured modes : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we also obtain an improved upper limit for @xmath37 .",
    "where applicable , the inclusion of charge conjugate modes is implied .",
    "we select intermediate final states in the following decay modes : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath11 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis is obtained at the @xmath2 and the nearby continuum in @xmath1 collisions produced by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and acquired with the cleo detector .",
    "the datasets consist of @xmath48=5.46  pb@xmath0 on the peak of the @xmath2 ( 2.57  pb@xmath0 for cleo  iii  @xcite , 2.89  pb@xmath0 for cleo - c  @xcite ) and 20.5  pb@xmath0 at @xmath49=3.67  gev ( all cleo - c ) .",
    "the nominal scale factor used to normalize continuum yields to @xmath2 data is @xmath50 , and is determined from the integrated luminosities of the data sets corrected for the @xmath51 dependence of the cross section , where the error is from the relative luminosity uncertainty .",
    "the actual @xmath52 used for each mode also corrects for the small differences in efficiency between the @xmath2 and continuum data samples .",
    "standard requirements are used to select charged particles reconstructed in the tracking system and photon candidates in the csi calorimeter .",
    "charged particles are identified using a likelihood function that incorporates de / dx from the drift chamber and information from the rich .",
    "the invariant mass of the decay products from intermediate resonant states such as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 must lie within limits determined from monte carlo ( mc ) studies .",
    "energy and momentum conservation requirements are imposed on the reconstructed final state hadrons , which have momentum @xmath61 and combined measured energy @xmath62 .",
    "we require the measured scaled energy @xmath62/@xmath63 be consistent with unity within experimental resolution , which varies by final state .",
    "we require @xmath64 .",
    "together these requirements suppress backgrounds with missing energy or incorrect mass assignments .",
    "the experimental resolutions are smaller than 1% in scaled energy and 2% in scaled momentum .    for the modes with two or more charged pions , two @xmath65 or an @xmath54 , we reject @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath54 ) events in which the mass of any of the following falls within the range @xmath69  gev : the two highest momentum oppositely charged tracks , the recoil mass against the two lowest momentum oppositely charged tracks , or the mass recoiling against the 2@xmath65 or @xmath54 .    for every final state , a signal selection range in @xmath62/@xmath63 is determined by mc simulation , and a sideband selection range is defined to measure background .",
    "final states with intermediate particles must satisfy a scaled energy signal selection range requirement identical to the corresponding mode without the intermediate particle ; and the event yield is determined from signal and sideband selection ranges of the intermediate particle mass .",
    "the number of events attributable to each @xmath2 decay mode is obtained by subtracting the number of events in the sideband region and the scaled continuum production from the number of events in the signal region .",
    "interference between @xmath2 decay and continuum production of the same final state is neglected .",
    "the efficiency for each final state is the average obtained from mc simulations for both detector configurations ; the two values are typically within a few percent ( relative ) to each other .",
    "no initial state radiation is included in the mc , but final state radiation is accounted for .",
    "we correct the number of signal for the efficiency and normalize to the number of @xmath70 , @xmath71 decays in the data , which has been determined previously to be @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "the resulting relative branching ratios are obtained and then converted to the absolute branching ratios using @xmath73  @xcite and @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 values are determined using the absolute @xmath2 branching ratios determined in this analysis and @xmath3 branching ratios from @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios and @xmath10 values for 2-body modes are given in table  [ tab:2body ] , where bes numbers are from @xcite ; preliminary results for multi - body modes  @xcite are listed in table  [ tab : multi ] .    [ tab:2body ]    [ tab : multi ]",
    "we have presented first evidence for @xmath2 decays to @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath75 .",
    "measurements for several other vp channels are also given .",
    "the results suggest that , for vp final states , @xmath2 decays through three gluons are severely suppressed with respect to the 12% rule and the corresponding electromagnetic processes are not . the decay @xmath76 exhibits a @xmath38 signal but has a much larger component at higher @xmath77 mass .",
    "we also present preliminary branching fractions for seven new multi - body decay modes of the @xmath2 , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and more precise measurements of nine previously measured modes , which are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we also obtain an improved upper limit for @xmath37 . for multi - body decay modes",
    "@xmath10 values are in general lower than , but , in most cases , consistent with the 12% rule .",
