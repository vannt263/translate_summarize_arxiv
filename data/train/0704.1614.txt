    "observational evidence for a bar has arisen from several sources , such as the study of gas kinematics ( e.g. @xcite ) , surface brightness ( e.g. @xcite ) , star counts ( e.g. @xcite ) and microlensing ( e.g. @xcite ) ; see @xcite for a review .",

    "this work uses a sample of stars 30 times larger than that of @xcite , with a greater number of fields distributed across a larger area of the galactic bulge , thus allowing finer constraints to be placed on the bar parameters than those determined by @xcite .",
    "our current understanding of the galactic bar is that it is orientated at about @xmath6 to the sun  galactic centre line - of - sight , with the near end in the first galactic longitude quadrant .",
    "the bar length is around 3.1  3.5 with axis ratio approximately @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the above bar parameters are generally accepted as a working model , however they are not well determined .",
    "our understanding of the complete structure of the inner galactic regions is similarly incomplete .",
    "for example , recent infra - red star counts collected by the spitzer space telescope for galactic longitudes @xmath8 = @xmath9  @xmath10 are best explained assuming a long thin bar oriented at an angle of @xmath11 to the sun  galactic centre line @xcite while most previous studies ( performed at @xmath12 ) prefer a short bar with an opening angle of @xmath13 .",
    "recently , @xcite report that nir observations of rcgs support the hypothesis that a long thin bar oriented at @xmath14 co - exists with a distinct short tri - axial bulge structure oriented at @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , there may be some fine features , such as a ring in the galactic bulge @xcite , or a secondary bar @xcite , that are not yet firmly established .",

    "we find the fitted bar parameters support the general orientation and shape of the bar reported by other groups .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  2 we describe the ogle microlensing experiment and photometry catalogue and we illustrate how rcg stars can be used as approximate distance indicators ; in section  3 we detail how rcgs in the ogle - ii proper motion catalogue are selected ; in section  4 we compute the distance modulus to the red clump in 45 ogle - ii fields and thereby trace the central mass density of the galaxy ; in section  5 we describe how rcg star count histograms for each field can be used to constrain analytic bar models of the inner galaxy ; our results and their comparison to previous works is given in section  6 and in section  7 we discuss the implications and limitations of these results .",

    "the observed rcgs are systematically 0.3 mag fainter than the fiducial local rcg at 8.0 .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this magnitude offset .",
