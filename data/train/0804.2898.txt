    "an important aspect in ecology is the comprehension of the distribution of populations of different species in space and time as well as the effect of the fluctuating environment in this diversity .",
    "both aspects concern the effort to conserve species , which should consider the extreme heterogeneous distribution of this diversity : from high diversity , like hot spots such as choco or the west african coast , to less diverse systems , like the german forest . not only the distribution , but also the extreme changes in the environment have a critical importance in forecasting the effect of extreme phenomena , such as global warming , in ecosystems @xcite .",
    "the effect of fluctuating environments has suggested a kind of insurance mechanism in populations . according to this hypothesis ,",
    "diversity can insure a population against decline in its functioning because there is a large set of actions that can give a response to these fluctuations ( see shigeo yachi et al .",
    "however , other models show that more diversity can not resist fluctuations in the environment , because the system fails to find , in a finite time , an equilibrium state ( r. may @xcite ) .",
    "this dispute is still open and restricted to the distribution of phenotypes .",
    "less attention has been given to the distribution of genotypes among a population . in recent years",
    "some theoretical works have investigated the geographic distribution of genetic diversity and , in particular , how some species are unevenly distributed @xcite , but this analysis is restricted to single individuals and does not take into account its interplay with the environment . because there is no clarity of what the effect is of the variability of the environment and individual selectivity on this distribution , it is then necessary to develop adequate models that allow this analysis . in this investigation",
    "we will focus on this specific problem .    if we want to consider , from a theoretical point of view , the effect of the environment on the population and , at the same time , the effect of the population on its environment , then a good starting point is to make use of game theoretical tools @xcite .",
    "some models implement a grade of variability to game theory assuming that the individuals can spatially change .",
    "such changes induce effects in the co - evolutive dynamics @xcite .",
    "this approach gives information about the natural behavior that some species may have in its population .",
    "for example , several species of birds migrate depending on seasonal circumstances or simply as a natural reaction to concurrence against other individuals .",
    "other works analyze the effect that the variation of the environment has in a population by means of analytical models considering phenotype switching .",
    "it has been shown that stochastic switching can be favored over sensing when the environment changes infrequently @xcite .",
    "when the environment is considered , its statistics are of central importance and must be taken into account in the population dynamics .",
    "such dynamics have an effect in the analysis of the phenotypic diversity ( for social systems see for instance huberman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . but the population s genotypic diversity ( or in general the relation to the memory size of individuals ) is an overlooked component that has wide - ranging effects in the community structure and ecosystem processes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of fundamental interest to extend the analysis of the population of genotypes ( memory sizes ) in contrast with the conventional analysis of genotypes .",
    "we focus on two behavioral aspects of the individuals : _ first _ , we consider adaptation and _ second _ we consider the individual ability to select the environment .",
    "the first aspect connects the genetics to the adaptability of individuals ; in this case , each individual adopts an action as a function of the information it stores from the opponents as well as its own past actions ( implying an individual learning process ) .",
    "this characteristic has allowed the construction of models that connect machine learning to genetics @xcite . however",
    ", this particular aspect can be extended to other applications of game theory where agents with adaptation are modeled @xcite . in machine learning the variability of the environment",
    "is represented as the noise when the information is processed .",
    "naturally , the adaptability of the individual depends in this case on the individual s memory size .",
    "the diversity of the population is , therefore , related to the number of different individuals with different memory size competing in order to increase their utility .    in a theoretical game scenario ,",
    "the environment could change in a periodical way .",
    "indeed , either the environment can have extreme changes or the individuals can choose the best - suited environment .",
    "this last case can have an origin in the change of its spatial position or by changing the interaction with other species .",
    "if the individuals can choose their interactions , they must then possess some mechanism that allows them to make choices .",
    "in co - evolution a central brain conduces the actions of the individuals attempting to increase the individual s fitness . however , an important part of this argument is the role played by a decentralized brain @xcite .",
    "a choice , which is related to a preference , can be located in two different levels : one ( relevant for population dynamics and genetics ) is a genetic level ; the second ( relevant for the behavior of populations of individuals ) is a rational level . in the first case it has been found that a large portion of the human genetic code is composed by non - protein - coding introns , which are nucleotide sequences that do not code specific proteins @xcite .",
    "this is a type of junk dna called micro - satellites ; a key feature is that some aspects in social behavior are apparently governed by repetitive micro - satellites found into the introns .",
    "the second level concerns the reaction in the brain within a decision making process , where the integration of emotional states with stored memories influence the way an individual define its choice @xcite .",
    "the present work is divided in the following parts . in the second part",
    "we explain in three subsections the basic definitions of the game : in the first subsection we introduce basic aspects of game theory and individual s selectivity ; in the second subsection we explain the mechanism for individual s adaptability ; finally in the third subsection we explain the mutation mechanism in the population . in the third part we present the central results obtained within this work .",
    "in the final part we discuss these results and we present an outlook of subsequent contributions .",
    "the actions of each individual and its opponent are rewarded according a pay - off matrix .",
    "this pay off represents the fitness of the individual related to a given environment . in several cases",
    ", the individual s action can also shape the environment , implying a co - evolution of the population and its environment .",
    "such co - evolution of individual s fitness and individual s action is mathematically represented by means of game theory .",
    "the action of individual @xmath0 is represented by an unitary vector @xmath1 , that can be either @xmath2 for @xmath3 ( cooperate ) or @xmath4 for @xmath5 ( defect ) . the pay - off of individual @xmath0 relative to individual @xmath6 is given by the following matrix @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the action of individual @xmath6 and @xmath9 is the game matrix .",
    "the pay - off of the agent @xmath6 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "in general @xmath11 . in the present model only pair interactions are allowed .",
    "the fitness matrix is represented by @xmath12 the scenario implemented in this work is for a prisoner s dilemma game , i.e. , the game matrix has the values @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is for temptation , @xmath15 for reward , @xmath16 for punishment and @xmath17 for sucker . in this model @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . using eq .",

    "the utility is a fundamental quantity that should determine the co - evolutionary process .",
    "given that the structure of the pay - off matrix is in general non - commutative , then @xmath25 .",
    ", @xmath26 , relative to its neighbors , @xmath27 , is represented by the two blocks above the diagram.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    however , when the individual observes that its game does not increase its fitness , then it can choose either to play a different game or simply not to play ( see fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "indeed , the individuals do not interact on a simple surface via a single pay - off matrix , but on a more complex landscape where the pay - off matrix is selected by the gamblers .",
    "the definition of non - absolute values in the interactions is made by means of an extended interaction matrix @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , an additional vector @xmath28 defines the preferred interaction of the agent @xmath0 .",
    "this vector points into each one of the interaction sub - matrices to be fixed in each interaction .",
    "the utility matrix for the agent @xmath0 has in this case the following form @xcite @xmath29{\\bf \\sigma^{i}}.\\ ] ] the games are characterized by three kinds of sub - matrices .",
    "one sub - matrix is defined under the restriction @xmath30 .",
    "the second sub - matrix is defined as a chicken game , which means that the mutual defection is the worst possible outcome .",
    "therefore , the values for this sub - matrix are @xmath31 .",
    "the values were arbitrary defined , but in such a way that @xmath32 , i.e. , temptation is not dramatically different to reward. additionally , @xmath33 , i.e. is a low risk game .",
    "a third sub - matrix representing a constant interaction is introduced , with the condition @xmath34 .",
    "this last sub - matrix implies for the agents a total risk aversion with low incomes .",
    "hence , the agents interacting in the present model could basically choose between more or less risk .",
    "simultaneously , these three fundamental options allow the game to switch between stable and unstable equilibrium states .",
    "we consider adaptable individuals that select an action according to what they observe from other individuals .",
    "the dynamics for the adaptation are represented using methods inspired in machine learning ( see for example@xcite ) .",
    "the individuals store information from the actions of their neighbors as well as their own actions in order to decide a new action.this dynamic implies that the individual is adapting to the whole population . in the present model we consider two layers : @xmath35 for the input information into the individual s memory and @xmath36 for the individual s output action . in genetics ,",
    "the first layer contains the information sequence of the grade in which two genes are inherited from a common ancestor @xcite .",
    "we define a memory containing the information sequence shared by the individual and its opponent . in order to keep this model as simple as possible",
    "we propose a function @xmath37 giving the grade of linkage of the individual s and its opponent s actions ( alleles ) .",
    "in a similar way as the genetical affected - sib - pair ( asp ) analysis , this function allows us to define a model similar to a one dimensional ising model @xcite , where the probability to obtain an offspring @xmath36 depending on the linkage of markers into the individual s memory sequence .",
    "the opponent s as well as the individual s past action at time @xmath38 ( offspring at time @xmath39 ) are defined as an input information ( that can be either 1 for @xmath3 or -1 for @xmath5 , which is related to the allele correspondence to previous offspring ) .",
    "for example the inividual @xmath0 stores the information of its opponent @xmath6 in the following way : @xmath40 corresponds to the input state @xmath41 , @xmath42 corresponds to the input state is @xmath43 ; in general @xmath44 corresponds to the input state is @xmath45 .",
    "the individual @xmath0 can store into its memory @xmath46 actions ( @xmath47 ) of its opponent @xmath6 and @xmath46 own actions ( @xmath48 ) , where @xmath46 is the memory size of individual @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath37 is defined as    @xmath49    where the strength of the connectivity -between the individual s and its opponent s markers- is directly proportional to the memory size of the individual . clearly , this is an oversimplification .",
    "however , we want to understand the effect that the fitness of the individual has on its adaptability ; given that the memory size depends on this fitness through a game ( see next subsection ) , then this option is a simple way to make an analysis of the interaction between adaptability and fitness .    .",
    "these curves represent tha adaptation process of individuals with different memory sizes .",
    "the larger the memory , the larger the probability that an individual remember past actions from its neighbors .",
    "hence , larger memories adapt in few time steps to a cooperate behavior . for @xmath50 the relaxation time increases.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "the second layer is the output of the information process : the individual s action , i.e. the individual s offspring , that can be either @xmath51 for @xmath3 ( cooperate ) or @xmath52 for @xmath5 ( defect ) . the transition probability is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 represents the extend of genetic linkages between markers and the effect of random genetic and environmental efects has on allele sharing @xcite , @xmath56 is the period of time and @xmath57 .",
    "the variability of the environment is related to the level of noise of the environment ( similar to the case of a teacher in a noisy classroom @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath58 the fluctuations of the information are small and the individual s actions relax to a cooperative behaviour ; a case that can be related to a frozen system . otherwise , if @xmath50 , then the fluctuations of the system increase , avoiding the individual to find in a short time a stable answer .",
    "the relaxation time depends on the adaptation parameter @xmath59 and the memory size @xmath60 .",
    "the larger the memory , the more stable is the answer and the shorter is the relaxation time .",
    "this case is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 and @xmath63 for three different parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "each individual in the lattice is characterized by its memory @xmath66 .",
    "if the individual s fitness is not large enough , its memory size can mutate into a new memory size @xmath67 . in this mutation process",
    "we assume that the individual has no lost of information ; the additional bit of information added to the memory after the mutation process is assigned in a random way .",
    "this mutation process has the following form @xcite : ( i ) _ selection _",
    "-an individual is selected for reproduction with a probability related to its fitness- ; ( ii ) _ reproduction _",
    "-the individual produces one offspring- ; ( iii ) the offspring replaces a randomly selected individual . the transition probability for the evolution of the memory size",

    "it is important to remark that the game has direct influence on the memory size of the individuals , not on their actions .",

    "given that more adaptable individuals tend to cooperate , then the frequency of cooperators increase when @xmath59 also increases , i.e. a population with more cooperators can survive in an environment with less noise .     and frequency of cooperators @xmath84 as a function of the inverse of the variability of the system @xmath55.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    finally three snapshots of the distribution of the memories in the lattice at large times are presented . for @xmath59 above 0.18 the population is dominated by large memories . below this value",
    "we observe dominance of individuals with small memory sizes .",

    "when @xmath93 both curves show a singularity . above this critical value the value of diversity is now larger , whereas the frequency of co - operators decreases .",
    "the second aspect is the non - reversibility of the curves .",
    "this could be related to a phase transition of first order ( formation of phase separation between individuals of different memory size ) and to memory effects related in a direct form to the model of perceptons for the individuals .    in order to make an analysis of the plasticity of the interactions in the population we make a comparison of the mean memory as a function of the time for fixed @xmath59 parameters .",
    "the remarkable result is the similitude between plastic and non - plastic games .",
    "however , the examination of the distribution of memories in the snapshots in the figure [ fig3 ] shows that the separation between low and large memories dissolves .",
    "this separation can be an artifact .",
    "the simulation starts in this case from an initial configuration with low memories ; the aggregation of large memories has , however , relation to the willingness to cooperate of the individuals .",
    "when the environment is extremely variable , large memories have a worse chance than small memories .",

    "the relaxation of the distribution function of the mean memory has been computed as a function of @xmath59 for plastic as well as non - plastic pay - off matrices .",

    "there is a singularity and the diversity reaches a plateau . when we consider plastic games we observe again a remarkable difference with rigid games , in particular the value of the diversity is larger .",
    "this result confirms that the variability in the pay - off matrices can increase the diversity of the distribution of memories in the population .",
    "the second characteristic is that at @xmath95 there is a cross over in the phase diagram of @xmath87 . above this value",
    "there is a smooth relaxation of the value of the diversity , until it reaches a plateau .",
    "the snapshot of the distribution of memories at the critical point for both dynamics can explain the different behavior of both phase diagrams : whereas in the rigid case a phase separation between memories of different sizes emerges , in the plastic case there is a kind of solution of large and small memories , i.e. , the plasticity of the interactions destroy the phase separation between memory sizes .",
    "we establish a relation between the diversity index and the frequency of co - operators . the black line in circles in figure [ div_coop ]",
    "represents a system with rigid interactions .",
    "the red line in squares represents plastic interactions . when the interactions are rigid it is possible to establish a relation that relates in an inverse proportion the diversity @xmath87 to the frequency of co - operators @xmath84 .",
    "this result is as a first approach a natural characteristic of a system with individuals doing an imitation of the actions of their neighbors . according to the rules of the system , cooperative individuals require larger memories .",
    "hence , if the system is more cooperative , then it is also more homogeneous because it is dominated by individuals with larger memory sizes , implying at the same time less diversity .",
    "when the diversity @xmath87 increases , then the willingness to cooperate decreases and a fusion of co - operators and defectors takes place .",
    "the frequency of defectors increases when @xmath101 and simultaneously the diversity index @xmath87 decreases .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram shows a maximal value of @xmath87 when the frequency of co - operators and defectors is equilibrated . below some particular value of @xmath84",
    "the diversity of the system again decreases . this is because defectors dominate the system .",
    "the implementation of flexible utilities introduces a dramatic change in the behavior of the system .",
    "if we allow the individuals to define their best outcome , then the diversity increases without changing the frequency of co - operators @xmath84 .",
    "in particular above @xmath102 the phase diagram can be fitted using a function of the form @xmath103 .",
    "we observe that @xmath104 , i.e. , the contribution of the quadratic term of this function decreases when the game is plastic .",
    "assuming an ecosystem composed of different kinds of individuals , with different internal characteristics , this result proposes a mechanism that shifts the original phase diagram obtained for rigid interactions , helping the system to increase its frequency of diversity without bringing about a change in the frequency of cooperativity .",
    "this result could bring some clues in the comprehension of the diversity of ecosystems .",
    "assume for instance an ecosystem with rigid utilities together with an ecosystem with flexible interactions , both separated by a thin barrier .",
    "both systems have the same intensity of fluctuation @xmath55 .",
    "however , one system shows more diversity than the other one , despite both being very close . in this example",
    "the internal characteristics of the environment ( the flexible utilities that can be selected by the individuals versus rigid utilities ) , and not the simple variability of the environment , are fundamental for the estimation of the value of diversity .",
    "the main result is the effect that variability of the pay - off matrix has in the co - evolution of large memories . in this work , as well as in previous works",
    ", we have shown that the larger this variability , the lower the chance that large memories have to co - evolve .",
    "if the external information source promotes the evolution of small memories , then this effect is more dramatic .",
    "this result could be surprising but it is , however , very plausible .",
    "the larger the memory the more information an individual can store from previous events .",
    "this process requires a very stable environment .",
    "once the environment fluctuates , the memory does not represent any advantage in evolution , producing an increase of the fitness of small memories .",
    "indeed , this observation depends on the correlation of the fluctuations of the environment , i.e. for correlated fluctuations the memory represents again a clear advantage @xcite .",
    "if moreover the external information favors small memories , then the diversity is again out of balance : instead of the evolution of large memories , the dynamics of the population show a prevalence of small memories .",
    "hence , variability as well as information are two important parameters that affect the development of a population .",
    "the plasticity in the interactions also has profound implications in the phase behavior of the system .",
    "first , it introduces additional fitness barriers that the system must overcome until it relaxes .",
    "moreover , the plasticity deteriorates the phase separation between large and small memories , generating a much better mixture of individuals . from a qualitative point of view",
    "this also is an improvement of the diversity , because it helps to increase the entropy of the system .",
    "we can also establish a dependence of the diversity as a function of the number of cooperators .",
    "we can determine in this phase diagram a critical frequency of cooperators where the diversity is maximal ; we also can observe an increase of diversity when the system is plastic .",
    "however , for a critical value of frequency of cooperators the phase behavior for plastic games converges to the phase behavior for rigid games , i.e. extreme variability not necessary improves the diversity of the system .",
    "the results obtained in this investigation could be used as a mechanism that can improve diversity in a population .",
    "the implications range from ecology to social science and could explain why genetic diversity can be found in certain systems . in the frame of this investigation ,",
    "the answer to this question is that diversity could be larger when individuals are allowed to decide their game , i.e. , when individuals can search for their best interaction with other individuals in an ecology .    in social sciences",
    "it could be an interesting result for the analysis of cooperation .",
    "some investigations have shown , for instance , that more cooperation requires less diversity @xcite .",
    "however , the result presented in fig .",
    "[ div_coop ] shows that more cooperation can allow more diversity if agents can define their pay - off . assuming adaptable individuals",
    ", this result implies that diversity and cooperativity depend on the degree of freedom that individuals have to move in a fitness landscape .",

    "<S> we conducted an investigation of the effect that extreme variability of the individual s environment has in the individual s adaptability and , in general , in the co - evolution of a population . </S>",
    "<S> first _ we assume that the individuals are a kind of perceptrons with a given memory size that adapt to their environment ; _ second _ we consider co - evolution not only of the individual actions but also of the memory size , depending on the individual s fitness ; and _ third _ we assume strong variability of the environment . we show that changes in the intensity of the environmental fluctuations introduce a phase transition in the frequency of cooperators and the diversity of the population . </S>",
    "<S> we also find out that extreme variability of the environment induces changes in the critical exponents and that this variability can promote more diversity in the population . </S>"
