    "in recent years , in order to study the properties of low - lying nucleon resonances and assess their parameters ( masses , widths , and electromagnetic coupling constants ) , significant experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to the process of meson production from the nucleon , which is achieved by exciting the nucleon resonances by means of photonic or electronic probes , and to the study of the decays of these resonances into mesons ( mainly pions ) @xcite .",
    "the parameters of these resonances , predicted by several theoretical models of baryons ",
    "lattice quantum chromodynamics @xcite , skyrme models @xcite , quark models @xcite  can be compared to the ones extracted from experimental data , which usually requires the aid of reaction models .",
    "this process of extracting the nucleon excitations parameters from experimental data is thus a crucial requirement in order to validate different hadron models , as it provides a guide for improving hadron models and for identifying the most reliable ones @xcite .",
    "together with pion scattering off the nucleon , single pion photoproduction is the most suitable process for studying the low - lying baryon spectrum .",
    "in fact , in recent years the experimental database @xcite has increased considerably and many experimental programs have been run at different facilities such as legs ( brookhaven ) @xcite and mami ( mainz ) @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the parameters of the resonances by means of a comparison of the results of reaction models to experimental data is an excellent example of a highly involved optimization task .",
    "problems in which a set of parameters must be established through comparison with experimental data are ubiquitous in physics .",
    "often , optimization has been considered a minor topic ( at times even trivial ) by the particle and nuclear physics community which has relied on gradient - based optimization tools such as minuit @xcite . sometimes , however , optimization problems are very complicated and gradient - based routines alone are not sufficient for the purpose , because the function to fit presents a complex structure with many local optima in which the codes get trapped before reaching anywhere near the desired absolute optimum .",
    "thus , until relatively recently , fitting model parameters to data has been a kind of art .",
    "this was particularly the case when thousands of data needed to be compared to the results of sophisticated models that depended on more than just a few parameters .",
    "in such cases , many instances of the optimization procedure have to be repeated , after manually adjusting the parameters , and specific care must be taken to prevent the optimization procedure from getting stuck at the many possible local minima positions .    recently , in nuclear and particle physics , more credit is being given to modern optimization procedures @xcite and to error estimations on the parameters stemming from the fits .",
    "modern and sophisticated optimization techniques such as simulated annealing @xcite and genetic algorithms ( ga ) @xcite have been developed over the last twenty years and have been applied to problems which are impossible to tackle with conventional tools .    in this paper",
    "we present a hybrid optimization procedure which combines a ga with a gradient - based (  hill - climbing  ) routine ` e04fcf ` from the nag library @xcite .",
    "the ga performs the bulk of the optimization efforts , ensuring that the parameter space is fully surveyed and local minima are avoided , while the conventional gradient - based routine , when applied to the preliminary minima found by the ga , provides fine - tuning and speeds up convergence .",
    "we have applied this tool to a complex , multi - parametric optimization problem , namely the determination of nucleon resonances parameters by comparing the results of a realistic model for the photo - pion production reaction to data . as a by - product ,",
    "the optimization procedure provides insight into the reliability of the values ( error bars ) of the parameters extracted and information on their physical significance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : reaction_model ] we briefly present the model for pion photoproduction on free nucleons from threshold up to 1.2 gev developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in section [ sec : strategy ] we present the strategy applied to solve the problem . in section",
    "[ sec : genetic - algorithm ] we present the ga in detail . in section [ sec : results ] we show the results obtained by the algorithm , analyze its performance and comment on the error bar estimates and the physical significance of the parameters extracted .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the reaction model is based upon a phenomenological lagrangian and it allows us to isolate the contribution of the resonances , calculate their bare properties , and compare these properties with the values provided by nucleonic models @xcite .",
    "in addition to born terms ( those which involve only photons , nucleons and pions ) and vector - meson exchange terms ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , the model includes all four star resonances quoted in the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite up to 1.8 gev of mass and up to spin-3/2 : @xmath0(1232 ) , n(1440 ) , n(1520 ) , @xmath0(1620 ) , n(1650 ) , @xmath0(1700 ) , and n(1720 ) .",
    "the internal structure of the nucleonic excitations shows up in the values of the electromagnetic coupling constants that appear in the lagrangian .",
    "the model displays chiral symmetry , gauge invariance , and crossing symmetry , and incorporates a consistent treatment of the interaction with spin-3/2 particles that avoids well - known pathologies of previous models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dressing of the resonances is considered by means of a phenomenological width which takes into account decays into one and two @xmath3 s and one @xmath4 .",
    "this width is included in a way that fulfils crossing symmetry and thus it contributes to both the direct and crossed channels of the resonances .",
    "we assume that the final state interactions ( fsi ) in the @xmath5 rescattering factorize and can be included through the distortion of the @xmath5 final state wave function .",
    "we include this distortion in a phenomenological way by incorporating a phase @xmath6 to the electromagnetic multipoles .",
    "we fix this phase so that the total phase of the electromagnetic multipole is identical to that of the energy dependent solution of said @xcite . in this way",
    ", we disentangle the parameters of the electromagnetic vertex from the fsi effects .",
    "our minimization procedure follows the one in @xcite although we use a more sophisticated ga and employ the ` e04fcf ` routine from the nag library @xcite instead of ` minuit ` @xcite code .",
    "we apply the minimization scheme to a realistic meson production model and the aim of our minimization is different .",
    "while in @xcite the aim was to establish the existence of certain resonances , in this paper our goal is to determine the parameters of well - established nucleon resonances and to obtain estimates on the reliability of these parameters and their associated error bars .",
    "the function to minimize is the @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the current energy independent extraction of the multipole analysis of said up to 1.2 gev for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 multipoles in the three isospin channels @xmath16 for the @xmath17 process @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 is the experimental error and @xmath19 is the multipole value given by the model .",
    "it depends on parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21,@xmath22 .",
    "we have taken into account 1,880 data for the real part of the multipoles and the same amount for the imaginary part .",
    "thus , 3,760 data points have been used in the fits . unlike cross - sections or asymmetries ,",
    "electromagnetic multipoles are not directly measured quantities and some elaboration of the raw experimental data is needed to obtain these multipoles .",
    "however , we have chosen , as it is very often done in this field , to fit electromagnetic multipoles instead of other observables .",
    "several reasons are mentioned when fitting to multipoles .",
    "on one hand , electromagnetic multipoles are more sensitive to coupling properties than other observables , so deficiencies in the model may show up more clearly .",
    "the second reason is that , in principle , all the observables can be expressed in terms of multipoles .",
    "thus , if the multipoles are properly fitted by the model , so should be other observables .    in order to determine the resonance parameters that best fit the data , we have written a hybrid optimization code based on a ga combined with the ` e04fcf ` routine from the nag library @xcite . although ga , are computationally more expensive than other algorithms , in a minimization problem it is much less likely for them to get stuck at local minima than it is for other methods , namely gradient - based minimization methods .",
    "gas allow us to explore a large parameter space more efficiently .",
    "thus , in a multi - parameter minimization such as the one we face here , they are probably a very efficient way of searching for the best minimum . in the next section",
    "we will go through the details of the ga .",
    "the parameters for the model ( @xmath23 ) are divided into two different kinds : ( i ) those that are obtained from models or experiments other than pion photoproduction , namely vector - meson coupling constants ( three parameters ) and masses and widths of the nucleon resonances ( fourteen parameters , one mass and one width for each resonance which have been taken from @xcite ) , and ( ii ) those that are extracted from pion photoproduction data , namely electromagnetic coupling constants ( fifteen parameters ) and the cutoff @xmath24 for born terms and vector - meson exchanges .",
    "we have allowed the algorithm to vary all the parameters ( see tables [ tab : parameters1 ] and [ tab : parameters2 ] ) . however , the parameters in the first group have been varied within a very small range , the experimentally allowed values for the vector - meson coupling constants and @xmath25 mev for the masses and widths of the nucleon resonances .",
    "the reason for allowing these parameters to vary , even though the range of variation is minimal , is to make room for the algorithm to search for the global minimum and to take into account the error bars for these parameters into the possible solution .",
    "this should help to prevent the algorithm for being trapped in local minima .",
    "the variation range for the second group of parameters are chosen to explore a large region of parameter space .",
    "hence we avoid introducing prejudgments on their values based on previous analysis .",
    "we prefer to use the helicity amplitudes ( for their definition and connection with coupling constants see refs .",
    "@xcite ) to define the ranges , instead of the electromagnetic coupling constants .",
    "we allow them to vary in the range @xmath26 $ ] gev@xmath27 .",
    "the cut - off @xmath24 is included in the form factors that multiply the born terms and vector - meson exchange invariant amplitudes .",
    "we use the form factors suggested in @xcite , which respect gauge invariance and crossing symmetry . for these born terms @xmath28 where @xmath29^{-1 } ,   \\quad l = s , u ; \\\\ g(t)&= & \\left[1 + \\left ( t - m_\\pi^2 \\right)^2/\\lambda^4 \\right]^{-1 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the mandelstam variables . for vector mesons , we adopt @xmath33 with the change @xmath34 . to reduce the number of free parameters for the model we use the same @xmath24 for both vector mesons and born terms .",
    "the form factors take non - resolved structure effects and higher order terms in the scattering matrix expansion into account .",
    "thus , the cut - off @xmath24 is related to the energy scale of the effective theory and the sensible values for @xmath24 should be of the order of the nucleon mass ( actually , in our best fit we obtain @xmath35 mev ) .",
    "for this reason , in the minimization process , we restrict @xmath24 to the range @xmath36 $ ] gev .    in order to perform the minimization ,",
    "the range of variation of each parameter is mapped into the @xmath37 $ ] interval for the ga and into @xmath38 for the ` e04fcf ` routine .",
    "this latter step is done by means of the transformation @xmath39 , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the model parameter , @xmath40 is the mapping of @xmath23 into @xmath38 , @xmath41 is the highest value of the range of variation , and @xmath42 is the lowest value . with regard to the range of variation allowed for the parameters , we must note that gradient routines work more efficiently if variations of similar magnitude on each of the search parameters introduce a similar variation on the function to minimize .",
    "the ` e04fcf ` user is advised to explore the region of parameters to minimize and to provide adequate rescaling of the problem before calling the routine . while the nag library provides tools that help in this task , in our combined algorithm we take advantage of the knowledge obtained on the variation of the objective function during the previous evaluations performed by the ga .",
    "we use this exploration to normalize the @xmath7 to unity and to rescale all the parameters affecting this function so that , according to the last evaluations of the best individuals explored by the ga , after rescaling of both the parameters and the function to optimize , the region explored by the nag ` e04fcf ` routine in its search for the minima is expected to lie in a hypercube of unit volume .",
    "we have indeed verified that this normalization and rescaling procedure improves nag routine performance .",
    ".ranges for the parameter values of the nucleon resonances .",
    "masses and decay widths have been taken within the ranges provided by @xcite .",
    "the helicity amplitudes are denoted by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 stands for isospin and @xmath45 for the helicity of the initial photon - nucleon state . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it has been proven that there is no optimal algorithm that adapts well ( that is , reaches a solution in the least number of evaluations ) to all kind of problems .",
    "this is often referred to as the _ no free lunch theorem _ in optimization @xcite .",
    "our goal here however is not to find the optimal algorithm that obtains the minimum to our problem in less evaluations but , rather , to develop a general tool that can be applied to many different models of parameter data fitting without specific fine - tuning nor human intervention , even if the performance of the tool is sub - optimal in terms of the number of operations . in this",
    "regard , gas are a handy choice , as they are suitable for many different problems .",
    "thanks to scaling and elitism , our ga converges neither too quickly nor too slowly and generally it is able to find good candidates for the global optimum .    when the individuals are very fit , it can be hard for the ga to evolve further , mainly because the path to the best individual may involve two or more consecutive mutations where each of these mutations on their own will produce a less fit individual that will sooner be removed from the population .",
    "the occurrence of such two favorable mutations in the same individual is unlikely and tailored procedures must be implemented to introduce specific mutations that are adequate for particular problems , or more complex operators like the tunneling algorithm @xcite or complex rules to encode the values of the functions , like mendelian operators implementing a non - dominant character for some genes @xcite . in our work , however , we prefer to employ a hybrid optimization method that combines a standard hill - climbing algorithm with a ga .",
    "hybrid optimization methods have been under study intensively @xcite .",
    "we have compared several ways of hybridizing gas and conventional gradient based hill - climbing algorithms , such as introducing the hill - climbing algorithm as another mutation operator .",
    "however , we have noticed that this will only make the ga converge sooner , very often too soon , resulting in it getting stuck at any of the many local minima . from our experience , if the hill - climbing procedure is introduced just at the end of the evolution , when the ga has converged , the best results are achieved and a robust algorithm that requires no human intervention is this way configured .",
    "also , no granularity is introduced in this final step of optimization .",
    "indeed , the nag routine is not restricted to integer values of the parameters , but instead represents each parameter as floating point values .",
    "thus , we can also consider that the ga finds the best optimum that can be represented within the grid implied by the granularity @xmath46 , and starting from this point of the grid , the nag routine refines a search not bound to any grid values .",
    "in fig . [ fig : fig_multipoles ] we show examples of fits to electromagnetic multipoles for the @xmath17 process and the overall agreement obtained . the values of the parameters are summarized in table [ tab : helicities ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : minimization_evolution ] we display an example of the evolution of the champion along the generations .",
    "two hundred generations are sufficient enough to achieve convergence , but we run the algorithm for another two hundred generations to see the effects of mutations , which can reach areas of the parameter space that are not being fully surveyed by means of crossover .    we observe that at the early stages of the evolution the fitness function improves quickly , as crossover works to concentrate the good schema from other individuals into a good individual . actually , a very steep slope in this region might indicate that evolution is too fast and that less fit individuals could disappear from the population before their good properties are transmitted to more fit individuals .",
    "when a jump in the @xmath47 happens , it is due to the appearance of a more fit new individual , either due to crossover or to mutation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : finetunning ] we can verify the existence of many local minima ( so this is certainly an ill - posed optimization problem ) and the fine tuning achieved by the nag routine which improves minima by approximately 2% .",
    "an important issue to consider in gas is efficiency .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the parameter space has to be discretized with a certain granularity and the algorithm searches for the best solution within the discretized version of the parameter space .",
    "the size of this space significantly affects the efficiency of the algorithm , thus a balance between granularity and computing time has to be achieved .",
    "the gradient based routine allows us to gain precision and efficiency because we do not need the ga to reach the minimum , we simply need it to provide a value close enough for the ` e04fcf ` routine can reach it .",
    "in other words the ga has to reach the region where the minimum lies , and once in this region , reaching the minimum is a task for the gradient - based routine .",
    "we must emphasize that the use of our algorithm is unattended .",
    "that is , we submit the script that starts 20 instances of the ga@xmath48nag procedure , and after the equivalent to five cpu - days ( opteron , 2 ghz ) , we get the results for the optimized set of parameters .",
    "no further human intervention was needed to choose initial values of the parameters or to guide the evolution .",
    "while the ga@xmath48nag may require more ( costly ) evaluations of the objective function , it is robust and needs no training nor good guesses of the initial parameters . now that computer power seems to be an increasingly available resource , the unattended mode of operation makes this hybrid algorithm a very interesting alternative for these optimization problems",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig : delta1232 ] and [ fig : delta1700 ] show a typical situation that may arise when the parameters are being determined . for @xmath0(1232 )",
    "the minimum is well - established and all the minima are constrained in a small region .",
    "the size of the region where the minima lie may provide a better estimation of the error associated with the parameters than the one provided by the correlation matrix . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta1232 ] the value for the @xmath49 helicity amplitude appears to be in one of two split regions that are too close to be physically distinguished ( left - upper panel ) .",
    "one region is centered at @xmath50 and the other at @xmath51 gev@xmath27 .",
    "the identification of these regions is one of the functionalities that gas provide and one of their main advantages . when multiple regions containing minima of similar quality appear , the possible physical implications should be considered and further analysis to assess whether these different regions hold physical meaning ( see subsection [ sec : oldfit ] ) is required .",
    "we also show the minima of the @xmath0(1700 ) that are constrained in just one region .",
    "however , this region is larger than for the @xmath0(1232 ) and the experimental information available for this resonance , thus , yields parameters that are not as well established as for other nucleon excitations .",
    "the evolution of the position of the parameters for different instances of the ga@xmath48nag procedure as the number of generations employed in the ga increases , is shown for the @xmath0(1700 ) resonance in figs .",
    "[ fig : ev_delta1700 ] and [ fig : delta1700_ev ] .",
    "we can observe how the region of the minimum decreases while the ga evolves .",
    "for the 50 generations plus nag run ( asterisks in figs .",
    "[ fig : ev_delta1700 ] and [ fig : delta1700_ev ] ) the @xmath7 is far away from its best value .",
    "this case exemplifies what happens when the parameters are assessed using the ` e04fcf ` after the ga had not been converged and therefore the ga is merely providing very smart guesses , for the starting point of the gradient based routine .",
    "we observe in this case that the results spread over a wide range of values of the parameters , showing that indeed this is a hard optimization problem . indeed",
    ", we expect that the starting values provided by unconverged instances of the ga are in fact much better that the ones we may figure without the aid of the ga .",
    "it is clear that to reach even an average quality optimum would be extremely hard ( if not impossible ) without the ga phase of our algorithm .",
    "after 150 generations plus nag ( open squares in figs .",
    "[ fig : ev_delta1700 ] and [ fig : delta1700_ev ] ) the result looks much better , showing a region where the values of the parameters are well delimited .",
    "the @xmath7 is remarkably better and close to the best values obtained after 400 generations plus nag ( solid circles in figs .",
    "[ fig : delta1700 ] , [ fig : ev_delta1700 ] , and [ fig : delta1700_ev ] ) .      the amount and quality of data is of great importance in assessing the parameters of any model .",
    "the pion photoproduction multipole data set employed for the fits in this work is the largest and of the highest quality ever available .",
    "it was released in 2006 and includes 3,760 data points .",
    "it is interesting to see what would happen if we employ the 2005 said database instead , which includes up to 1.0 gev photon energy and considerably fewer ( 1526 ) data points , as done in refs .",
    "we find that the results change for the not so well - determined resonances as is the case of the @xmath0(1700 ) one .",
    "we find in this case several minima lying in more than one region .",
    "[ fig : delta1700old ] is equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig : delta1700 ] but in this case fitting to the former data set .",
    "it becomes apparent how the minima split into two distinct regions .",
    "[ fig : delta1700_evold ] is equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig : delta1700_ev ] and shows how the regions are formed as the algorithm evolves .",
    "it also shows that a gradient method alone leads the optimization to incorrect answers most of the time .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the appearance of this minima structure .",
    "for instance , this can be caused by deficiencies in the model or in the data .",
    "we must keep in mind however , that this result can even have a physical meaning such as a possible shape coexistence for a state that can fit the data equally well for two sets of parameter values .",
    "this would have to be studied within a model in which the resonance is included as a combination of both states and re - fit to experimental data .",
    "however , it seems that this is not the situation we encountered here .",
    "the results presented in the previous subsection and in fig . [ fig : delta1700 ] clearly indicate that improving the database and extending the model to higher energies ( which allows one to account for the tail of the @xmath0(1700 ) resonance ) are sufficient to collapse the two @xmath7 regions into one single region .",
    "we have presented a hybrid optimization procedure which combines a ga with the gradient - based routine ` e04fcf ` from the nag libraries .",
    "we have successfully applied this algorithm to determine the coupling constants of the low - lying nucleon resonances within a realistic lagrangian model of the pion photoproduction reaction .",
    "the results for the couplings were summarized in table [ tab : helicities ] .",
    "traditional optimization tools are often useless for this kind of multi - parameter optimizations when the parameter space is large and the function to fit presents many local minima .",
    "the assessment of the low - lying resonances properties by means of reaction models is an example of a very difficult optimization problem for conventional algorithms @xcite .",
    "the hybrid optimization procedure presented in this paper is a powerful and versatile optimization tool that can be applied to many problems in physics that involve the determination of a set of parameters from data .",
    "it is a promising method for extracting both reliable physical parameters as well as their confidence intervals . indeed ,",
    "computing correlations among different parameters by comparing different solutions obtained by the hybrid optimization method , in a manner similar to what is shown in the panel on the right in fig . 6 , is probably more meaningful than the simple covariance matrices returned by gradient based optimization routines .",
    "finally , we have shown how we can use the procedure we have outlined to identify weaknesses in the model and assess the reliability of the parameters obtained .",
    "not only the error bars have to be considered when quoting the uncertainty in the determination of a parameter , but also whether the minima are concentrated into one single region or split into several ones , and the possible physical explanations of such situation .",

    "<S> we present an optimization scheme that employs a genetic algorithm ( ga ) to determine the properties of low - lying nucleon excitations within a realistic photo - pion production model based upon an effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> we show that with this modern optimization technique it is possible to reliably assess the parameters of the resonances and the associated error bars as well as to identify weaknesses in the models . to illustrate the problems the optimization process may encounter , we provide results obtained for the nucleon resonances @xmath0(1230 ) and @xmath0(1700 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former can be easily isolated and thus has been studied in depth , while the latter is not as well known experimentally . </S>"
