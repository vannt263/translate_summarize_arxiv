    "we will call the faces other than the outer one _ inner faces_. the maps whose all inner faces are of degree 1 can be easily represented in the form of weighted trees : just merge every sheaf of parallel edges into one edge and indicate the number of edges merged together as the _ weight _ of the corresponding edge of the weighted tree : see fig .",
