    "a spatial and momentum anisotropy is created that is most readily observed in the first ( @xmath13 - directed flow ) and second ( @xmath11 - elliptic flow ) fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distributions measured with respect to the reaction plane of the collision . in this analysis , the reaction plane method and a subevent technique",
    "are used to calculate flow@xcite .",
    "the phobos experiment measured collisions of au nuclei at @xmath14 of 19.6 , 130 , and 200 gev in 2000 and 2001@xcite .",
    "silicon sub - detectors were used for flow analysis , including the octagon and ring detectors which cover @xmath15 and all azimuthal angles .",
    "in addition , the spectrometer arms allow for charged particle momentum measurement in @xmath16 .",
    "two independent methods are employed in the flow studies : hit - based analysis using the octagon and rings@xcite , and track - based derivation using the spectrometer and octagon@xcite . both methods allow for widely separated subevents which reduces non - flow effects .",
    "the susceptibility of the two methods to background effects is quite different due to the tracking , and good agreement has been shown between phobos elliptic flow measurements with hit - based and track - based methods@xcite .",
    "the charged hadron @xmath11 as a function of @xmath17 , measured by phobos for 200 gev au+au collisions is shown by the circles in figure [ fig : v2]a ) .",
    "also shown are star measurements for 130 gev au+au collisions analyzed with three different methods .",
    "previous measurements demonstrate that elliptic flow changes little from 130 to 200 gev at @xmath18 gev / c@xcite . the phobos measurement matches star s 4-particle cumulant results , which has been shown to be insensitive to non - flow effects@xcite .",
    "this confirms our expectation that our flow results are not strongly biased by non - flow contributions .    for 200 gev au+au collisions we study the pseudorapidity dependence of elliptic flow as a function of centrality .",
    "results of the two methods agree and are combined and plotted as a function of @xmath12 in figure [ fig : v2]b ) for three broad centrality ranges .",
