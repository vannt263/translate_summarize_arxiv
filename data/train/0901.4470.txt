    "superconducting qubits @xcite consist of electronic nanocircuits embedding josephson junctions whose dynamics can , in certain parameter regimes , be restricted to a two - dimensional manifold .",
    "these qubits can be used as test - beds for studying quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level @xcite , and are also potential candidates for the practical implementation of quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "an interesting and challenging aspect of these endeavours is the process of decoherence , whereby qubits lose their quantum - mechanical nature and are rendered dynamically equivalent to their classical two - level counterparts . in the case of a superconducting charge qubit , such as the cooper - pair box ( cpb ) , dephasing ( phase decoherence ) is dominated by low - frequency noise thought to be caused by interactions with two - level fluctuators  @xcite ( tlfs ) in the local environment .",
    "these tlfs may be charge traps caused by defects / impurities in the josephson junction or in the substrate .",
    "there has been a substantial amount of research on tlfs causing single qubit decoherence in josephson junction systems .",
    "theoretical works have concerned larger ensembles of tlfs , both incoherent @xcite and coherent @xcite , that randomly switch between two configurations , producing low - frequency fluctuations in the relevant qubit parameters . as discussed in detail in all these works , whenever a large number of tlfs are very weakly coupled to the qubit",
    ", their effect can be described by a conventional boson bath with a suitable chosen spectral density .",
    "this is however not always the case  there may be situations when only one or a few impurities are important .",
    "indeed , neeley , @xcite have demonstrated the existence of _ coherent _ tlfs .",
    "lupacu , @xcite provide evidence that these tlfs are in fact genuine two - level systems .",
    "in neeley s experiment @xcite a single tlf that was coupled to the qubit led to an avoided crossing in the qubit energy spectrum .",
    "the tlf was used as a proof - of - principle memory qubit , but such tlfs will in general be detrimental to the operation of superconducting qubits .",
    "it is therefore desirable to understand the behaviour of tlfs in the vicinity of superconducting qubits in order to better - equip quantum information scientists to manage the challenge of decoherence .    in view of its importance for understanding decoherence in superconducting nanocircuits",
    "we study in this paper the effect that a few underdamped , coherent tlfs have on the quantum dynamics of a charge qubit . a single qubit coupled to a single coherent tlf , that was in turn ( under-)damped by a bosonic bath",
    "was already considered in  @xcite .",
    "we find this type of non - equilibrium environment  @xcite to be an appealing model of the environment of a josephson junction qubit because tlfs may be damped by phonons in the substrate , for example .",
    "we refer to this as a composite _ spin - boson environment_. the case of a few tlfs , which will be considered here , is rather complex and therefore we resort to extensive numerical calculations .",
    "our approach represents quite a general strategy for probing a composite spin - boson environment , whereby we derive a markovian master equation for the average dynamics of the probe+tlfs after tracing out the external baths . to allow for the random nature of tlf formation",
    ", we select the tlf hamiltonian parameters according to probability distributions designated in @xcite . of the many environmental properties that could be studied in this scenario , we focus on inferring the presence or absence of coherent coupling between the tlfs .",
    "connectivity _ of the tlfs has been identified as important in the decoherence of a bipartite qubit system @xcite , with further - reaching importance for quantum computing .    performing a more thorough treatment of this situation is increasingly important in light of recent experiments @xcite involving superconducting qubits coupling predominantly to only a small number of tlfs . in these experiments , measurements on the qubit were used to infer properties of the tlf ( although that was nt the focus in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the qubit was used as a probe of the environment @xcite .",
    "probing properties of a small collection of tlfs , such as whether or not they interact with each other , necessitates consideration of the full dynamics of the probe plus tlfs under the influence of external baths .    from the theory point of view , identifying structural properties in the environment could be done using some form of noise correlation measurements . here",
    "we focus on inferring environmental features via the analysis of the entanglement that will build up in a probe consisting of two non-(directly ) interacting qubits whose remote coupling is mediated by the tlfs present in the surroundings .",
    "when the probing is `` local '' , so that each probe qubit couples to just one single tlf , the absence of quantum correlation generation would immediately signal a non - connected environment , given that the probe qubits can only become entangled if the fluctators would couple to each other .",
    "entanglement swapping in those circumstances has been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "when probe qubits are subject to the action of a _ few _ tlfs , as it happens in qubit realizations in the solid state , we will show that the remote entanglement in the probe bears signatures that can be linked to the connectivity in the environment and can in some cases be related to monogamy constraints @xcite .",
    "given that bipartite entanglement has been shown @xcite to be lower - bounded by combinations of pseudo - spin observables , we also analyze what information can be extracted from magnetization measurements along a given direction ( in the case considered here the magnetization along the z - direction corresponds to the average charge ) and study the power spectra of magnetization observables using both single and bipartite probes .",
    "we find that a double - qubit probe generally outperforms a single - qubit probe , a result that could perhaps be expected given the extra degrees of freedom available in the composite system .",
    "we supplement our analysis of correlation measurements by investigating the decoherence of composite probes initially prepared in a certain maximally entangled state when subject to a composite spin - boson environment , as well as the performance of entangling gate operations when performed in the presence of this type of noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system ] sets the scene by describing our model for the double - qubit probe and spin - boson environment .",
    "a detailed derivation of the proposed master equation as well as a discussion of its validity domain are presented in the appendix .",
    "numerical results for probing the connectivity of the spin - boson environment are presented in section [ sec : connectivity ] , using both probe entanglement and estimated power - spectrum analyses .",
    "we summarize and discuss these results in section [ sec : discussion ] , as well as compare the double - qubit probe to a single - qubit probe . in section",
    "[ sec : entdecay ] we investigate the decoherence of maximally - entangled bell states induced by a composite spin - boson environment .",
    "the performance of bipartite entangling gates in the presence of this form of noise is analyzed and discussed in section [ sec : gates ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the system we consider is illustrated in .",
    "it consists of two charge qubits ( blue spheres ) acting as probes of an environment containing tlfs ( grey spheres ) .",
    "each qubit is coupled to a few tlfs ( black lines in the figure ) but probe qubits are assumed to not directly couple to each other . in the numerical calculations we will consider the case in which there are four tlfs .",
    "four tlfs is a balance between generating the desired spectral features ( requiring an ensemble of tlfs @xcite ) and maintaining reasonable computation time ( smaller hilbert space ) .",
    "also , it may be the case that only a few tlfs will couple strongly to a josephson junction qubit , as in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we should stress that the conclusions of our work do not depend on this choice .    in the charge basis , each qubit /",

    "note that the pseudo - spin basis for the impurities is different to the probe ( the @xmath12 axis is rotated relative to @xmath13 ) because the probe and tlf energies will differ , in general .",

    "the tlf decoherence rates @xmath35 are proportional to the respective dephasing , emission and absorption rates @xmath36 ( see [ sec : mederive ] ) , which are functions of the temperature and spectral properties of the @xmath22th bosonic bath ( with absorption dramatically reduced at low temperatures ) .",
    "further , the tlf decoherence rates are also functions of the ratio of local field to bias , @xmath37 @xcite . to get a feel for the influence of this ratio ,",
    "if we assume dissipation - limited dephasing ( @xmath38 ) and sufficiently low temperature ( @xmath39 ) , then @xmath40 dictates the dominance of pure dephasing or relaxation in each tlf . specifically , @xmath41 so that pure dephasing dominates the tlf decoherence for weak local fields , and relaxation dominates for strong local fields . following @xcite , we distribute the random tlf parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath42 as per the distributions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "we choose these parameters to take values within the following moderate ranges : @xmath14 @xmath46 @xmath47 ; @xmath15 @xmath46 @xmath48 ; @xmath42 @xmath46 @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the minimum spin frequency amongst the tlfs .",

    "we take the probe - tlf coupling to be uniform ( @xmath26 ) and weak compared with all of the tlf frequencies : @xmath55 .",
    "our assumption of weak probe - tlf coupling simplifies the master equation derivation significantly ( see equation [ approxexp ] ; a detailed discussion of an analogous situation can be found in @xcite ) , and is in addition to the standard born - markov approximation of weak tlf - bath coupling . weak probe - tlf coupling is in accord with the recent experiments of @xcite , as well as the experiment of @xcite ( see @xcite ) where @xmath56 mhz and @xmath57 ghz .",

    "generating the correct statistics is not within the scope of this paper as we are interested in describing effects when the environment is dominated by only a few fluctuators .",
    "we restrict our knowledge to the probe subsystem ( as would be the case in an experiment ) .",
    "a notable observable quantity on the probe is the magnetization , which is related to a simple sum of pauli operators : @xmath60 .",
    "the appeal of considering the probe magnetization is that it requires only tractable , local measurements on each probe qubit .",
    "that is , our results may be easily tested in an experiment .",
    "it is worth noting that a result of audenaert and plenio @xcite shows that measuring correlations @xmath61 along the xx and zz ` directions ' suffice to give a lower bound on the probe entanglement .",

    ", @xmath67 is a discrete quantity ( the data is a time series ) , and so the power spectrum obtained is an estimate ( the fourier transform of the reduced autocorrelation of the time series @xmath67 ) .",
    "this estimate of average power as a function of frequency can theoretically be improved ( by increasing the duration of the experiment , for example ) , but this may not be practical in reality . strictly speaking , @xmath67 must be a wide - sense stationary process ( time - independent first and second moments ) for the power spectrum to exist .",
    "can probe observables reveal the degree of connectivity of a composite spin - boson environment ? in this section we present numerical results showing that this is indeed the case .",
    "observable quantities we consider are the probe magnetization , its estimated power spectrum , and the remote entanglement between the probe qubits . entanglement generated between probe qubits that are initially in a separable state is primarily due to the structure of the spin - boson environment ( e.g. , the presence or absence of tlf - tlf interactions in the surroundings of the probe ) .",
