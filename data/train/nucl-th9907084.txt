    "the heavy quarkonium ( for which we will use a generic notation @xmath0 ) has a small size ( @xmath3 ) and a large binding energy ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "when we consider an interaction with light hadrons ( @xmath5 ) at a low ( compared to @xmath6 ) energy , the amplitude can be expanded in multipoles @xcite : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the wilson coefficients ( polarizabilities ) which reflect the structure of the quarkonium .",
    "the matrix elements of the gauge - invariant local operators @xmath9 over the light hadron state contain the information about the long distance part of the process ; we assume that the factorization scale in this formula is @xmath6 .",
    "this approach has been applied to the evaluation of inclusive cross sections of heavy quarkonium dissociation in hadron gas in @xcite . here",
    "we evaluate exclusive cross sections of @xmath1 interactions .",
    "previously these interactions were addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; detailed description of our formalism and results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the leading operator in ope for the amplitude is @xmath10 , which describes the emission of two gluons in the color - singlet state .",
    "( the magnetic coupling is suppressed by the velocity @xmath11 for a heavy @xmath0 . )",
    "one can re - write this operator in the lorentz covariant form , @xmath12 .",
    "as will be discussed below , the scale anomaly implies that the matrix elements of the stress tensor , @xmath13 do not depend on the coupling @xmath14 and dominate over the matrix elements of the gluon tensor operator , @xmath15 , which is manifestly suppressed by @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "scale anomaly effectively eliminates the factor of @xmath14 in the amplitude !",
    "= 7.8 cm    let us consider @xmath0 interactions with pions , which are the dominant degrees of freedom at low energies / temperatures . since @xmath16 is scale invariant , we can match it onto its expression in terms of the effective pion lagrangian , and find a beautiful relation @xcite @xmath17 valid in the chiral limit . in the leading order in ope",
    ", the amplitude of the @xmath1 elastic scattering can be written as @xmath18 where , in the polarizability @xmath19 , we have factored out the bohr radius @xmath20 and the rydberg energy @xmath21 of quarkonium , respectively ; @xmath22 is the pion formfactor in the scalar - isoscalar channel , which takes account of the resonances in this channel .",
    "the resulting elastic cross section of @xmath0 with mass @xmath23 @xmath24 appears to be very small ( see fig .",
    "1 ) because of the factor @xmath25 stemming from the double - dipole nature of the interaction",
    ". moreover , it is further suppressed by the dependence on the momentum transfer @xmath26 of the cross section dictated by the chiral symmetry .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the @xmath1 elastic cross section for the @xmath27 case ; one can see that the cross section is very small .",
    "this result implies that the @xmath27 s produced in heavy ion collisions interact with the surrounding @xmath28 gas very weakly .",
    "the @xmath29 broadening of the @xmath0 s by the interactions inside the pion gas therefore is negligible .",
    "next we consider the inelastic excitation process , @xmath2 .",
    "the energy transfer in this process is on the order of the binding energy , @xmath30 , which may invalidate our starting assumption of the factorization .",
    "fortunately the double - dipole form is intact , but _ non - local _ in time .",
    "we replace the gluon energy appearing in the energy denominator with the typical value , @xmath31 , as an approximation , to make the gluonic operator local : @xmath32 where the @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the internal wave function of @xmath0 ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is the effective hamiltonian describing the intermediate , @xmath37 color  adjoint quark  anti - quark state . with this amplitude",
    "we get the transition cross section shown in fig .  2 .",
    "our replacement of the gluon energy in the energy denominator is an approximation with an accuracy that can not be evaluated _ a priori_. we can , however , apply our formula to the decay process @xmath38 and compare our results , @xmath39=260 ( 70 ) kev obtained with ( without ) taking account of the formfactor @xmath40 , with the experimentally measured value of 135@xmath4120 kev . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that our calculations are probably valid up to a factor of 2 .",
    "our results support the idea @xcite that the interactions of heavy quarkonia in the hadron gas and in the quark - gluon plasma are very different .",
    "low - energy onium - onium scattering is a very interesting subject , which was addressed by several authors @xcite .",
    "one may regard this problem as a first step toward the understanding of nuclear force from qcd . here",
    "we derive a sum rule for this interaction @xcite .",
    "after the multipole expansion for the interactions of both @xmath0 s with the gluon field is performed , the potential between them can be expressed through the @xmath16 correlator : @xmath42 where we have introduced the spectral function for the @xmath16 correlator as @xmath43 with the coordinate - space scalar feynman propagator , @xmath44 ; @xmath45 .",
    "an important theorem @xcite for the @xmath16 correlator relates it to the non - perturbative energy density of the qcd vacuum : @xmath46 since the vacuum energy density is divergent in perturbation theory , we define the r.h.s . by subtracting the perturbative part .",
    "this relates the integral of the spectral density to @xmath47 as @xmath48 . in the heavy quark limit",
    ", this relation leads to the following sum rule for the potential @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the size of the onium .",
    "this sum rule relates the overall strength of the interaction between the dipoles to the energy density of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the short and long  distance limits of the potential are analyzed in ref .",
    "in particular , it appears that the long - distance limit of the potential has an interesting @xmath51 dependence , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the pion mass ) , with a non - trivial dependence on the numbers of colors @xmath54 and flavors @xmath55 , @xmath56 .    *",
