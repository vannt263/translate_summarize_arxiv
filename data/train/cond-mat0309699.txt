    "since the discovery of superconductivity it was expected that if the superconductor was subjected to a constant electric field superconductivity will inevitably be destroyed .",
    "the reason is that the superconducting electrons will be accelerated by the electric field and will reach a velocity above its critical velocity .",
    "however if the sample is short enough or if the electric field exists only in a small part of the sample such that the path over which the cooper pairs are accelerated are sufficiently short an electric field can exist in the sample in the presence of superconductivity .",
    "another example is the presence of an electric field in the superconducting sample which is attached to a normal metal . in this geometry",
    "the injected current from the normal metal will be converted into a superconducting current on a distance of about the charge imbalance distance ( @xmath3 ) and on that scale an electric field will exist in the sample @xcite . in this case",
    "the electric field is compensated by the gradient of the chemical potential @xmath4 of superconducting electrons and it does not lead to an acceleration of the superconducting condensate ( see for example the book of schmidt @xcite ) .",
    "but there is another mechanism which allows superconductivity to survive in the presence of an electric field deep in the superconducting sample of arbitrary length .",
    "this is the _ phase slip _ mechanism .",
    "initially this phenomena was used in order to estimate the relaxation time of superconducting current in a superconducting wire @xcite .",
    "if the order parameter vanishes in one point of the wire the phase of the superconducting order parameter exhibits a jump of @xmath5 at that point @xcite and as a result the momentum @xmath6 decreases by @xmath7 .",
    "so even if the electric field accelerates the superconducting electrons it does not lead to a destruction of supercondictivity because the momentum is able to relax through the phase slip mechanism .",
    "this simple idea was understood already a long time ago .",
    "therefore , it is very surprising that there are practically no experimental nor theoretical works studying in detail what will happen if a voltage ( i.e. electric field ) is applied to the superconductor . in previous works mainly the situation with applied current ( i.e. the i = const regime ) was studied . in the latter case",
    "the phase slip process was studied theoretically in detail ( see for example the review of ivlev and kopnin @xcite and the books of tinkham @xcite and tidecks @xcite ) . on the basis of a numerical solution of the extended time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations it was found that the phase slip ( ps ) phenomena exists in some region of currents .",
    "the lowest critical current at which a ps solution first appears in the system may be smaller than the depairing ginzurg - landau current density and as a result it leads to hysteresis in the i - v characteristics in the i = const regime @xcite .",
    "the i = const regime was also studied experimentally in a number of works @xcite starting from the paper of meyer and minnigerode @xcite .",
    "the most characteristic effect of the phase slip mechanism is the appearance of a stair like structure in the current - voltage characteristics . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple phenomenological model was built in order to quantitatively describe this feature .",
    "it was proposed that every step in the i - v characteristic is connected with the appearance of a new phase sip center ( psc ) that increases the resistivity of the sample by a finite value . in this model , it was conjectured that in a region of the sample with size of about the coherence length @xmath8 fast oscillations of the order parameter occurs in time which produces normal quasi - particles .",
    "because of the finite time needed to convert normal electrons into superconducting electrons @xcite there is a region of size of about @xmath3 near the phase slip center where the electric field and the normal current are different from zero .",
    "it means that the chemical potential of superconducting @xmath4 and normal electrons @xmath9 are different near psc and their difference is proportional to the charge imbalance q in a given point of the superconductor @xcite . because usually @xmath10 it is possible to neglect the @xmath8-sized region with oscillating @xmath11 and consider that phenomena as a time - independent process .",
    "such a model gives a finite voltage , which is connected with every phase slip center , which is equal to @xmath12 with @xmath13 the normal resistivity , s the cross - section of the current carrying region , @xmath14 is the critical current and @xmath15 is a phenomenological parameter . in the experiment of dolan and jackel @xcite",
    "the distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath9 near a psc were measured which fully supported the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite that a difference exist between @xmath4 and @xmath9 near the phase slip center .    despite numerous theoretical and experimental works the physical conditions under which phase slip phenomena",
    "can exist is still not clear . in a review @xcite on this subject it was claimed that phase slip phenomena are connected with the presence of a limiting cycle in the system which leads to such type of oscillations .",
    "but it was not explained how and why it leads to the phase slip phenomena .",
    "based on our previous work @xcite on the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations ( the investigated systems were superconducting rings in the presence of an external magnetic field ) we know that systems which are governed by such equations exhibit two relaxation times .",
    "one is the relaxation time of the phase of the order parameter @xmath1 and the other is the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was established that phase slip processes can occur in such systems when roughly speaking @xmath2 . in the present paper",
    "we discuss this question in the context of superconducting wires in the presence of an applied current or voltage",
    ".    to our knowledge there exists only a single theoretical work in which a superconducting wire in the presence of an applied voltage was studied @xcite .",
    "the authors used the simple time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations and found that the behavior of the system is very complicated and strongly depends on the length of the wire and the applied voltage .",
    "neither a detailed analysis nor any physical interpretation of their results was presented . in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we presented our preliminary theoretical and experimental results on the dynamics of the superconducting condensate in wires under an applied voltage .",
    "it turned out that in this case the i - v characteristics exhibit a s - shape which was explained by the appearance of phase slip centers in the wire and their rearrangement in time . in the present paper",
    "we will present more details and extend our previous work to the situation in which defects are present , and we investigate the effects of boundary conditions and an applied magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "ii we present our theoretical results and give the conditions for the existence of phase slip centers when current ( sec .",
    "iia ) or voltage ( sec .",
    "iib ) is applied to the superconducting wire . in sec .",
    "iii we show our experimental results and in sec .",
    "iv we compare theory and experiment .",
    "we study the current - voltage characteristics of quasi - one - dimensional superconductors using the generalized time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation .",
    "the latter was first written down in the work of ref .",

    "is scaled by @xmath33 and the current density by @xmath34 .",
    "time is scaled in units of the ginzburg - landau relaxation time @xmath35 , the electrostatic potential ( @xmath27 ) , is in units of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the normal - state conductivity ) . in our calculations",
    "we mainly made use of the bridge geometry boundary conditions : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we chose these boundary conditions because at low temperatures the normal current is converted to a superconducting one due to the andreev reflection on a distance of about @xmath42 near the @xmath43 boundary @xcite .",
    "it means that practically there is no injection of quasi - particles from the normal material to the superconductor and hence we can neglect the effect of charge imbalance near the s - n boundary . the bridge geometry boundary conditions models this situation .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is about @xmath44 according to ref .",
    "we also put @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( 1,2 ) because we considered the one - dimensional model in which the effect of the self - induced magnetic field is negligible and we assume that no external magnetic field is applied .",
    "lets consider first the more simple case when a constant external current is applied to the sample .",
    "in such a case it was theoretically found @xcite that the system exhibits hysteretic behavior . if one starts from the superconducting state and increases the current the superconducting state switches to the resistive superconducting or normal state at the upper critical current density @xmath46 which , in a defectless sample , is equal to the ginzburg - landau depairing current density @xmath47 . starting from the resistive state and decreasing the current it is possible to keep the sample in the resistive state even for currents up to @xmath48 ( which we call the low critical current ) .",
    "for @xmath49 such a state is realized as a periodic oscillation of the order parameter in time at one point of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "when the order parameter reaches zero in this point a phase slip of @xmath5 occurs .",
    "this is the reason why such a state is now called a phase slip state and this point a phase slip center ( psc ) . using results obtained in our earlier work @xcite we claim that the value of @xmath50 depends on the ratio between the two characteristic times in the sample : the phase relaxation time of the order parameter @xmath1 and the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath51 in the region ( with size of about @xmath8 ) where the oscillations of the order parameter occurs .",
    "having written eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the dynamics of the phase and the absolute value of the order parameter in a quasi - one dimensional wire of length l ( -l/2@xmath52s@xmath52l/2 )    @xmath53    it is easy to estimate both these times . indeed , from eq .",
    "( 3a ) it directly follows that @xmath54 to determine @xmath1 we need to know how fast the phase changes over the region ( with size of about @xmath8 ) at which the order parameter oscillates .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that the time - average of the derivative is @xmath55 ( with c(s)=const and @xmath56 the theta function ) . because the time - averaged electrostatic potential @xmath27 changes over a distance @xmath57 for @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the decay length of the normal current density and the charge imbalance @xmath60 ) and that the order parameter is about unity already at @xmath61 , we can estimate this constant as @xmath62 .",
    "consequently we find that @xmath63 the product @xmath64 is roughly the voltage drop @xmath65 produced by the phase slip center @xcite .",
    "thus the time change of the phase of the order parameter in the phase slip center is inversely proportional to the voltage drop over the whole structure ( and @xmath66 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the time - averaged electro - chemical potential of the superconducting electrons @xmath67 does not change in space and its jump near the phase slip center is equal to the voltage drop of this structure in the sample . in terms of the language used by schmid and g. schn @xcite , @xmath0 is the longitudinal time and @xmath1 decreases with increasing transverse time because @xmath68 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the phase slip events occur periodically in time when @xmath69 .",
    "this gives us an estimation for the lower critical current @xmath70    by varying the parameter @xmath19 we can change both @xmath0 and @xmath3 and hence we can vary @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the voltage in the sample , the normal current density and the absolute value of the order parameter in the phase slip center averaged over the time as a function of the external current for two different values of @xmath19 . in our simulations we started from the superconducting state with @xmath71 . at @xmath72",
    "the system jumps instantaneous to the resistive state with finite voltage @xcite . than we decrease the external current and at @xmath73 the system transits to the purely superconducting state with @xmath74 .",
    "we should emphasize that at @xmath75 the voltage jumps by a finite value ( this result is qualitatively different to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors found that @xmath76 at @xmath77 . ) .",
    "it means that there is a non - infinite maximal oscillation period for the order parameter in the phase slip center .",
    "we believe that the finite voltage jump @xmath78 or finite period of oscillations is directly connected with the threshold condition @xmath79 for activation of regular phase slip processes in the constant current regime and it means that @xmath80 .    before going further we should stress here that the above condition for the existence of a phase slip process @xmath81 is a rather rough estimate . indeed , eqs .",
    "3(a , b ) are a coupled system of equations , and besides @xmath0 , it explicitly ( see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) depends on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "however , the above condition allows us to explain the general qualitative properties of the phase slip processes ( including the existence of @xmath78 , @xmath50 and its dependence on @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) and predict new features which will be discussed below .    .",
    "solid curves correspond to @xmath82(@xmath83 ) , and the dotted curves are for @xmath84 ( @xmath85).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    far enough from @xmath50 the dependence of @xmath86 on the current is close to linear .",
    "when the current increases , @xmath1 decreases ( see eq . ( 5 ) ) and hence the time @xmath87 between two phase slips also decreases and the order parameter has less time for recovering at the phase slip center .",
    "that is the reason why the time averaged voltage increases ( as @xmath88 ) , the averaged order parameter @xmath89 decreases and the fraction of the normal current @xmath90 increases with increasing external current .",
    "it is interesting to note that from the phenomenological skocpol - beasley - tinkham ( sbt ) @xcite model it follows that @xmath91 which qualitatively resembles the dependence shown in fig .",
    "let us now discuss the effect of defects on the i - v characteristic .",
    "this question was considered previously in ref .",
    "@xcite for two different models of defects : local variation of the critical temperature and a local variation of the mean free path .",
    "we will repeat these calculations partially and interpret it in terms of a competition between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the first type of defect we will also study the effect of the variation of the cross - section of the wire .",
    "the first type of defect is the inclusion of a region in the superconductor which suppresses @xmath92 and the order parameter becomes lower than the equilibrium value @xmath31 even in the absence of any external current .",
    "this is modelled @xcite by introducing the term @xmath93 in the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in the present calculation",
    "we choose @xmath94 .",
    "the larger @xmath95 the more the order parameter is suppressed in the center of the wire .",
    "firstly , such a defect leads to a decrease of the upper critical current @xmath46 .",
    "secondly , it decreases the lower critical current @xmath50 . indeed , when we introduce a defect , the rhs of eq .",
    "( 3a ) decreases at the spatial position where the order parameter oscillations and hence @xmath11 needs more time to change in that spatial position .",
    "thus this type of defect leads to an increase of the relaxation time of the order parameter in the region of the defect ( as an indirect prove of this we found a decreasing @xmath96 with increasing strength of the defect ) .",
    "if the size of the defect is smaller than @xmath3 we can neglect its effect on the relaxation time of the phase of the order parameter .",
    "finally , we can conclude that the stronger the defect the smaller the value of the lower critical current @xmath50 .",
    "( dotted curve for @xmath97 , dashed curve for @xmath98 and solid curve for a wire without defect ) .",
    "figure ( b ) corresponds to a local variation of the cross - section of the wire which we modelled as @xmath99 .",
    "solid curve in this figure is for a wire without a defect , dashed curve for a wire with defect parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 , dotted curve with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , dash - dotted curve with @xmath100 and @xmath103 .",
    "the length of the wire is @xmath104 and the parameter @xmath82 ( @xmath83).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in fig .",
    "2(a ) we present our numerical results for two different values of @xmath95 . with increasing strength of the defect the upper and lower critical currents decrease and start to merge . as a consequence",
    "the hysteresis in the i - v characteristics will disappear when the defect is sufficiently strong .",
    "the second type of defect is one for which we have a local decrease of the cross - section of the wire . in this case",
    "we expect that @xmath0 will not be influenced .",
    "the situation with @xmath1 is more complicated because a large part of the superconductor with size of about @xmath105 participates in the formation of this time .",
    "two limiting cases can be distinguished .",
    "if the defect is much smaller than @xmath3 we can neglect its effect on @xmath1 and hence we will have the same lower critical current as for the case of an ideal wire . in the opposite case of a defect with size much larger",
    "than @xmath105 we only have to take into account the increased current density in the part of the wire where we have a smaller cross - section and apply eq .",
    "( 5 ) . in this case",
    "the current @xmath50 is decreased by a factor @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the average cross - section and @xmath108 is the local reduced cross - section .",
    "another important question is the value of the upper critical current @xmath46 .",
    "if the size of the defect is larger than @xmath8 then the proximity effect from adjacent parts near the defect will be small and @xmath46 will decrease by a factor @xmath109 ( in the opposite case the current @xmath46 is almost defect independent ) .",
    "therefore , for a defect with length @xmath110 the i - v characteristic may be reversible with a proper choice of the parameters ( like in the case of a local suppression of @xmath92 ) . in fig .",
    "2(b ) we show the results of our numerical calculations and we obtain a qualitative agreement with the above physical arguments . when the length of the defect is smaller than @xmath3 then the lowest critical current density practically does not change . in",
    "the opposite case @xmath50 decreases by a factor of @xmath109 .",
    "the upper critical current density changes considerably only if the length of the defect exceeds @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to consider the case for which the length of the defect is simultaneously much smaller than @xmath3 and much larger than @xmath8 because of computational restrictions .",
    "for example , when we increase @xmath19 by a factor of two the time of calculations increases also by a factor of two but the ratio @xmath111 increases roughly only by a factor of @xmath112 for @xmath58 .",
    "the reason is that when we increase @xmath19 we need to take a smaller time step ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) which increases the computation time .     on the length of the superconducting wire for different values of @xmath19 .",
    "the current @xmath50 is normalized to its value ( @xmath113 ) at lengths @xmath114 . with increasing @xmath19",
    "the decay length of the normal current increases and hence @xmath50 starts to depend on @xmath115 for longer wires . in the inset ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath50 on the length of the superconducting wire for s - n boundary conditions is shown.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    when the wire has a length less than @xmath3 then this will affect the distribution of the normal current density in the wire and hence the time @xmath1 and the lower critical current @xmath50 . indeed from our bridge boundary conditions it follows that @xmath116 ( see eq .",
    "3(b ) ) . then taking into account that @xmath117 we can easily obtain , in the limit @xmath118 , that @xmath119 where the current @xmath120 is the average normal current in the phase slip center .    the voltage jump @xmath121 at @xmath50 should not change with varying @xmath115 ( at least for @xmath122 when proximity effect does not have an effect on @xmath0 ) . from eq . ( 7 ) it follows then that the normal current density increases with increasing length . but @xmath120 should always be smaller than the full current @xmath123 .",
    "it implies that the critical current density @xmath50 will increase with increasing length of the wire as @xmath124 in order to keep the ratio @xmath125 constant .",
    "3 illustrates the dependence of @xmath50 on the length of the wire which we obtained on the basis of a numerical solution of eqs .",
    "unfortunately , in our calculations we are not able to use very large values of @xmath19 and the maximal value of @xmath105 was @xmath126 for @xmath84 .",
    "but nevertheless , we found that @xmath50 increases with decreasing wire length .",
    "we should add here that we also found that @xmath78 also decreases a little bit .",
    "we connect it with a small change in @xmath0 due to the small length of the wire and hence the increased effect of the boundaries .",
    "the more pronounced effect of the finite length of the wire on the value of @xmath50 is found for the case that we used n - s boundary conditions : @xmath127 and @xmath128 . these boundary conditions are approximately valid for samples at temperatures close to @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to show that in this case @xmath129 where @xmath130 ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in this case",
    "@xmath50 also increases with decreasing wire length ( see inset in fig .",
    "3 ) . but besides there is a finite length @xmath131 for which @xmath132 .",
    "it implies that the phase slip process is not possible in wires with length @xmath133 . in such wires",
    "the system goes from the superconducting state directly to the normal state .",
    "not only the finite length of the sample is able to change the value of @xmath50 .",
    "if we apply a magnetic field parallel to the length of the wire it will suppress the order parameter in the sample .",
    "our analysis shows that if the diameter of the wire @xmath134 is less than @xmath135 and if we can neglect screening effects ( @xmath136 ) then the distribution of the order parameter will be uniform along the cross - section of the wire .",
    "the order parameter depends on h as @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "this behavior is very similar to the behavior of a thin plate in a parallel magnetic field @xcite or a thin and narrow ring in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite . in all cases",
    "the transition to the normal state is of second order and the vorticity in the wire will be equal to zero due to the small cross - section of the sample .    because the order parameter practically does not depend on the radial coordinate of the wire we can use the one - dimensional model in order to study the response of the system on the applied current . in order to take into account the suppression of @xmath11 by magnetic field ( @xmath139 ) we add to the rhs of eq .",
    "( 1 ) the term @xmath140 . in some respect",
    "it is similar to the way we introduced the first type of defect in our wire .",
    "we can expect that @xmath0 will increase with increasing @xmath139 ( because the strength of the defect increases ) .",
    "but because the magnetic field suppresses the order parameter everywhere in the sample it also leads to an increase of @xmath3 , because in the tdgl model @xmath141 .",
    "it is clear that both these processes should decrease @xmath50 .",
    "the strongest mechanism is connected with the change in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed it is easy to estimate that @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "even if we take into account that the parameter @xmath19 may decrease with increasing h ( because in non - zero magnetic field there is another pair - breaking mechanism and instead of @xmath20 we should use@xcite @xmath144 with @xmath145 ) it does not lead to an increase of @xmath50 with an increase of @xmath139 because @xmath0 changes faster than @xmath1 even in this case .    in the above model",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath146 for the case of an uniform wire . in fig .",
    "4 we present the results of our numerical calculations .",
    "we found that both @xmath50 and @xmath46 decreases with increasing magnetic field and at some @xmath147 they practically merge .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite difficult to find an analytical expression for the dependence of @xmath148 like we had for @xmath46 .",
    "the reason is the complicated behavior of the dynamics of @xmath149 in the phase slip center .",
    "the variation @xmath3 with increasing @xmath139 was obtained experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite . to compare with the theory the authors of ref .",

    "@xcite it was found that expressions of schmid and schn are quantitatively valid even far from @xmath92 . from this observation",

    "the transition period also consists of two parts : the time needed for the phase slip processes ( which is proportional to the number of phase slip events and hence the length of the wire ) and the time @xmath169 for the decay of the order parameter from @xmath170 ( when @xmath171 ) till the first phase slip event and for the recovering of @xmath11 back to @xmath170 from zero after the last phase slip event ( see fig .",
    "the minimal number of phase slip events which occur during the transition time is determined by the internal parameters of the superconductor ( @xmath50 ) and its length @xcite which is given by @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the smallest real root of the equation @xmath174 and @xmath175 returns the nearest integer value .    at @xmath166 the time - averaged current @xmath176 increases ( with oscillations ) and in the range @xmath177 it decreases with increasing voltage .",
    "the lowest minimal current in the latter region is @xmath178 which depends on the length of the system ( see fig . 5 and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fig . 7 we present the dependence of the above voltages on the length of the wire .",
    "the explanation for their different behavior is the following . at a voltage @xmath159 the period of the oscillation @xmath179 ( n is the number of phase slip events during the transition time ) of the current becomes of order @xmath180 .",
    "the time @xmath169 does not depend on the length and the voltage at @xmath181 .",
    "so , we can estimate @xmath159 as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the average time between two phase slip events and @xmath184 is the coefficient which depends on @xmath173 ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) and hence on the specific superconductor .",
    "when @xmath185 the voltage @xmath159 becomes practically independent of the length . because the time @xmath169 depends on the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter the length of the wire @xmath186 at which @xmath159 saturates depends on the internal parameters of the superconductor .",
    ".,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     and @xmath160 on the length of the wire .",
    "the results are obtained for @xmath82.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the voltage @xmath160 decreases with increasing length of the sample because the lower critical current @xmath178 decreases .",
    "it is interesting to note that with accuracy of finding @xmath159 the saturated value of the lower critical voltage coincides with the voltage jump @xmath78 at @xmath187 in the constant current regime .",
    "because the minimal value of @xmath160 is equal to @xmath78 for an infinitely long wire we may conclude that with increasing wire length the i - v characteristic in the range of voltages @xmath188 approaches the horizontal line .",
    "defects , magnetic field , short length of the sample etc . will decrease the hysteresis and consequently the currents @xmath50 and @xmath46 approaches each other . if the difference between them will be small enough the s - shape of the i - v characteristic at the constant voltage regime changes to the usual monotonic behavior ( see fig .",
    "8) . this happens because when the voltage approaches @xmath159 , the maximal current during the period of the current oscillation @xmath189 will be about @xmath50 ( because @xmath190 can not substantially exceed @xmath46 but @xmath46 is already close to @xmath50 in this case ) .",
    "regime the i - v behavior in the @xmath158 regime is a single - valued function of the current.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we also would like to discuss how the change of the boundary conditions will change the shape of the i - v characteristic . if we apply the n - s boundary conditions the i - v curve in the voltage driven regime also exhibits an s - behavior but without oscillations in the current at small voltages ( see fig .",
    "in this case there will always be an inevitable voltage drop near the boundaries connected with the current in the wire through the relation @xmath191 ( because the electric field and the normal current decays on a scale of the charge imbalance length @xmath3 near the boundaries @xcite ) .",
    "near the boundary the nonzero electric field is compensated by the term @xmath192 ( see eq .",
    "3(b ) - and @xmath193 in our units ) and the superconducting electrons are not accelerated by this field .",
    "the situation is very similar to the case when we inject a current in the wire . when the current generated by this voltage reaches @xmath50 the phase slip process becomes possible in the system .",
    "but like the case of the current driven regime the superconducting state can be stable(metastable ) until the current reaches @xmath46 at @xmath194 . from our estimates",
    "it follows ( see section below ) that the fluctuations of the order parameter are very important in our samples .",
    "therefore , in our calculations we introduce at some moment of time ( at fixed voltage ) a phase slip center in the center of the wire and checked if it will survive or not . as a result we obtained the i - v characteristics as presented in fig .",
    "when the voltage is less than some critical value ( @xmath195 ) the phase slip process decays in time and the resulting current in the wire is time - independent .",
    "the whole voltage drop occurs near the boundaries . at @xmath196 ( and @xmath197 )",
    "the dynamics of the condensate in the wire will be similar to the case considered above for @xmath198 .",
    "the reason for this is as follows .",
    "the current density in the wire at small voltages will always be less than @xmath50 and @xmath46 due to the relation @xmath199 .",
    "when the current density reaches @xmath50 the phase slip process becomes possible in the sample .",
    "but such a phase slip process leads to a finite voltage . as a consequence",
    "the voltage drop at the boundaries will sharply decrease when a phase slip center is created .",
    "but it implies that the full current density will also decrease and consequently will become less than @xmath50 .",
    "we can conclude that the phase slip process may survive in such a type of superconductor only if the applied voltage will be roughly equal to @xmath200 plus the voltage drop near the boundaries @xmath201 necessary for the creation of a current larger than @xmath178 .",
    "concluding the theoretical part , we present in fig . 10 the i - v characteristics in the i = const and v = const regimes at different temperatures close to @xmath92 . with decreasing temperature the range of currents , where there is a s - behavior increases and the voltages @xmath159 and @xmath160 increases .",
    "it resembles the experimental results presented in @xcite and in the subsequent section iii .     at different temperatures close to @xmath92 .",
    "we used typical parameters for pb : @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     measurements of the i - v characteristics were done on single pb nanowires @xcite with typical diameter about @xmath205 and length @xmath206 ( see table i ) . at first",
    "we would like to discuss the rather wide resistive transitions and strong magneto - resistance effect ( see figs .",
    "11 - 12 ) in our samples .",
    "we may claim , taking into account the small diameter of our nanowires , that the effect of the thermo - activited @xcite and the quantum - activated @xcite phase slip phenomena is very strong in our samples .",
    "it is easy to see that with increase of the diameter of the nanowire the width of the resistive transition decreases .",
    "our estimations , based on giordano expressions , @xcite showed that for sample a even at @xmath207 the number of quantum phase slip events should be about @xmath208 per second .",
    "that is the reason why we did not observe in our experiment any hysteresis in the current driven regime ( see below ) .",
    "but this rate is not large enough for destroying the s - behavior in the voltage driven regime .",
    "indeed , the period of oscillations of the current for pb is about @xmath209s at @xmath181 and @xmath207 .",
    "it means that only at temperatures close to @xmath92 the fluctuating psc s will interrupt the internal temporal oscillations in the order parameter and ruin the s - behavior . in other words",
    "the system can be in a state with @xmath197 only during a time which is less than the time between two phase slips .",
    "this results in the coincidence of the i - v characteristics both in the current and the voltage driven regimes at temperatures close to @xmath92 ( see fig . 3 in ref .",
    "we would like also to mention the small difference in the critical temperatures which implies that all our samples have practically the same value of the superconducting gap .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "12 , the wider the transition width in @xmath210 , the smaller the magnetic fields where the resistance starts to increase with increasing magnetic field .",
    "of course , our nanowires are not free from imperfections . although our fabrication technique produce samples which are quite regular ( see ref . @xcite for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) picture ) , we may distinguish two kinds of imperfections .",
    "firstly , there can be deviations from an ideal cylindrical shape .",
    "indeed , although the nanopores of the membrane in which the nanowires are grown are designed to be as regular as possible , there may exist a smooth variation in diameter along the length of the nanowire , which we estimated to be not more than 10 @xmath211 .",
    "however , in addition to these smooth variations , it may happen that a defect in the membrane leads to a constriction in the measured nanowire . in this case",
    ", the diameter can be locally reduced quite importantly and this results in a lower critical current and a larger critical magnetic field .",
    "this is in fact what we observed in sample c. in addition to such shape imperfections , we note also that the parameters of our nanowires strongly vary from sample to sample - see table i ( we estimated the coherence length using the expression @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) and @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) for the critical field ) .",
    "the reason for this difference in resistivity is related to the second kind of imperfections , which is structural disorder that is formed during the electrodeposition of these nanowires inside the nanopores . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these nanowires are polycrystalline and inevitably contain structural defects such as dislocations , twins , etc .",
    "these two kinds of imperfections results in differences in the i - v characteristics ( fig .",
    "for example for samples a and b we observed two jumps in the voltage which we explain by the appearance of two successive phase slip centers in the nanowire but for sample c we found only one jump in the voltage .",
    "indeed , due to the presence of a constriction in this sample , heating may drastically affect the behavior of this sample , precipitating the return to the normal state .",
    "unfortunately sample d was broken during the measurements and we could not measure its i - v characteristic .",
    "we found that jumps in the voltage @xmath78 are practically the same for all three samples ( see figs .",
    "13 - 14 ) .",
    "it agrees with the theory presented in sec .",
    "ii . indeed all the three samples have almost the same @xmath92 and hence the same superconducting gap .",
    "it is naturally also to suppose that the time @xmath20 is almost the same for all our samples .",
    "we can expect that the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath18 are the same for all our samples and consequently the relaxation time @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath111 are the same .",
    "this automatically leads to the invariance of @xmath78 on @xmath13 . from the results of sec .",
    "iib follows that the voltage @xmath160 decreases with increasing ( in @xmath8 ) nanowire length ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . for our shortest sample",
    "a : l@xmath216 ( see table i ) .",
    "it means that in our nanowires the voltage @xmath160 already reaches the minimal value @xmath78 and hence @xmath160 is independent of @xmath13 for our nanowires .",
    "the voltage @xmath159 depends not only on the length of the nanowire but also on the time change of the order parameter during the transition period @xmath169 ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) and hence the voltage @xmath160 may reach @xmath96 at shorter lengths than @xmath159 if the time @xmath169 is large enough ( in fig .",
    "6 the opposite situation is presented - at first @xmath159 reaches the saturated value ) .",
    "if the current density is uniformly distributed over the cross - section of the sample then the oscillations of the order parameter will be in phase along the cross - section and in this case the @xmath78 will not depend on the size of the sample .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the fact that the time - averaged chemical potential of the superconducting electrons should be equal and constant on both sides of the phase slip center or phase slip line / surface .",
    "our results show if one uses the skocpol - beasley - tinkham ( sbt ) @xcite model for the estimation of @xmath3 one should be very careful . indeed , those authors replaced the normal current density in the ps center by the expression @xmath217 .",
    "as a result the derivative @xmath218 becomes current independent .",
    "but in general the time derivative may be large than unity ( see figs .",
    "1(a , b ) ) .",
    "secondly , if the length of the sample is comparable with @xmath3 we should replace @xmath219 by @xmath220 ( see eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) . as a result",
    "the differential resistance in samples with @xmath221 may be larger , in general , than the normal one @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to our samples ( @xmath222 ohm , @xmath223 ohm and @xmath224 ohm for samples a , b , c respectively after the first jump in voltage ) .",
    "but from the sbt model follows that @xmath225 ( the equality sign holds for samples with @xmath226 ) .    unfortunately we do not know the actual dependence @xmath227 for our samples .",
    "if we use the values obtained from the sbt model ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 for samples a , b and c , respectively ) which is qualitatively understandable for longer samples , we have a too small number of psc ( compare samples a and c ) . and in this case , the question arises why @xmath3 changes so much .",
    "probably , the sbt model gives us only the correct order of magnitude for @xmath3 which is only useful as an estimate .",
    "( see fig .",
    "5(a ) and 13 ) for samples a - c at different temperatures.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    finally , we present our results on the influence of an applied magnetic field on the i - v characteristics .",
    "we limit ourselves to data for sample a in the current driven regime ( see fig .",
    "these results already support our theoretical predictions of section iib .",
    "it is evident that the lower critical current density decreases with increasing applied magnetic field . from some range of h",
    "- values only one jump in the voltage exists .",
    "we explain it by an increase of @xmath3 at relatively large magnetic fields and hence there is a lack in space for the coexistence of two phase slip centers in the nanowire . at high magnetic fields the order parameter",
    "is strongly suppressed by h and the effect of quantum phase - slip fluctuations becomes more pronounced .",
    "this is the reason for a smoothing of the i - v characteristics at high magnetic fields .",
    "in conventional superconductor near t@xmath231 the n - s boundary conditions ( in the sense mentioned in sec .",
    "iia ) are valid @xcite . for @xmath232",
    "the bridge boundary conditions are more applicable due to andreev reflections at the border between the normal metal and the superconductor @xcite . at intermediate temperatures",
    "we expect a mixture of the n - s and bridge boundary conditions .",
    "it means that part of the voltage will drop at the boundaries and part in the sample .",
    "the situation in our experiment is even more complicated because in our two - point measurements there is also a voltage drop at the contacts .",
    "probably , this will not allow us to observe the oscillations of the current in the voltage driven regime .",
    "another reason is that our samples are very long compared to @xmath8 ( even for our 22 @xmath233 sample @xmath234 ) and consequently the amplitude of the oscillations is very small .",
    "but nevertheless our calculations in both limiting cases of bridge and n - s boundary conditions predicts an s - shape of the i - v characteristic .",
    "we found that the type of boundary conditions are not so important for the process of nucleation of phase slip centers if the length of the sample is much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "however , the difference in the process of the conversion of superconducting electrons to normal ones and vice versa at the n - s boundary at various temperatures plays a crucial role for the creation of phase slip centers in shorter nanowires .",
    "it turned out that for similar parameters ( nanowire s length , coherence length , superconducting gap , @xmath20 ) phase slip centers appear in the superconducting wire at smaller currents for the case of the bridge geometry boundary conditions .",
    "all our theoretical results are strictly speaking only valid near @xmath92 , which is the temperature region where eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) are quantitatively correct .",
    "nevertheless , experimental results supports our prediction on the competition of two relaxation times in the creation of a phase slip center even far from @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , an applied parallel magnetic field decreases the lower critical current ( compare fig . 15 and fig .",
    "4 ) . jumps in the voltage @xmath78 turned out to be almost an independent function of the disorder ( of the resistance of the sample ) as it follows from theory . unfortunately",
    ", it is rather difficult to check the dependence of @xmath50 on the length of the nanowire using our technique because every preparation of a new sample leads to a different level of disorder and hence different values for @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we expect only quantitative differences in the dependence of @xmath235 , @xmath236 , as compared with our theoretical results .",
    "some qualitative differences ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the dynamic of the order parameter at the phase slip center or the creation of charge imbalance waves @xcite can not affect the main properties of our theoretical results because it does not influence the existence of the two different critical currents : @xmath50 and @xmath46 .",
    "it may lead to quantitative differences in the dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 on the microscopic parameters of the superconductor .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss other mechanisms which , for our geometry , may lead to an s - behavior of the i - v in the v = const regime .",
    "the first is heating @xcite . in order to explain the double s - structure for our samples a ,",
    "b by this mechanism we have to assume that heat dissipation and heat evacuation have a very complicated and non trivial dependence on temperature .",
    "we do not know any mechanisms which can lead to such adependence in our case .",
    "besides we did not any observe hysteresis in the current driven regime which is an inevitable property of that mechanism if the i - v characteristic would have a s - shape in the voltage driven regime .",
    "for these reasons we believe that heating is not responsible for the observed behavior .    secondly , if the nanowire contains a normal region the i - v characteristic will exhibit an s - behavior due to multiple andreev reflection in the sns structure @xcite .",
    "we do not have any indication for this process from our r(t ) and r(h ) measurements which shows that our samples are quite homogeneous .",
    "furthermore the structure would occur at voltages much smaller than @xmath237 . in our case",
    "the s - behavior is seen for @xmath238 - see fig .",
    "13 ( for pb , @xmath239 ) .",
    "andreev reflection on the n - s boundaries may give rise to a zigzag shape of the i - v in the v - const regime @xcite but this effect is negligible for our samples with @xmath240 .",
    "this work was supported by iuap(p5/1/1 ) , goa ( university of antwerp ) , esf on `` vortex matter '' , the flemish science foundation ( fwo - vl ) and the `` communaut franaise de belgique '' through the program `` actions de recherches concertes '' .",

    "for our parameters @xmath242 so that in order to prevent the appearance of several phase slip centers simultaneously when @xmath197 we put a small defect ( of first type with @xmath243 - see discussion in the text on the effect of defects on the phase slip process ) in the center of the sample in order to provide the existence of only one psc in the wire .                    it is interesting to note that if in a short sample @xmath221 two ps centers may appear and the differential resistance will practically not change after every voltage jump and should be approximately equal to the normal one if @xmath244 . the change in the voltage will probably only be connected in this case with a change in the coefficient @xmath245 , because in short nanowires the psc should strongly interact with each other .",
