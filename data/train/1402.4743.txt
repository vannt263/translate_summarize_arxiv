    "the subsequent spectral emission can be used to diagnose the physical conditions of h ii regions , planetary nebulae , active galactic nuclei and many stars  see for example @xcite .    in order to have confidence in the temperatures , densities , and chemical compositions deduced from modeling such emission",
    "it is important that the uncertainties in the atomic data be well understood and their effects modeled .",
    "energy levels can be compared with observed .",
    "radiative data can usually be computed with increasingly large configuration interaction expansions to demonstrate convergence to a sufficient degree .",
    "the case of electron - impact excitation is more problematic .",
    "the complexity of the open @xmath19-subshell leads to a large number of low - lying target levels which should be coupled together in a scattering calculation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix method is paramount here .",
    "it has been advantageous to introduce some approximations into the scattering problem which leads to the highly efficient and widely used intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) @xmath0-matrix method @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently modeled fe iii line intensities from the orion nebulae which had been observed by @xcite .",
    "they found much better accord between theory and observation when they used excitation data which they calculated with the dirac atomic @xmath0-matrix code ( darc ) methodology @xcite than that they calculated with the icft method .",
    "their icft maxwellian - averaged collision strengths for transitions from the ground level to all other levels of the @xmath20 configuration differed by up to a factor 3 ( both larger and smaller ) from their darc ones at @xmath21  k. they attributed this difference `` to the limited treatment of spin - orbit effects in near - threshold resonances '' by the icft method .",
    "this surprising finding has implications not just for the validity and use of the icft method but also the @xmath0-matrix ii @xcite fine method @xcite with which it shares some similarities .",
    "there are a number of issues which can be raised about the comparison made by @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that to be able to deduce anything meaningful about two scattering methods from a comparison of collision data it is necessary that the differences in the atomic structure be kept to an absolute minimum .",
    "@xcite used a much larger configuration interaction ( 36 configurations ) for their icft atomic structure compared to that for their darc one ( 8 configurations ) .",
    "they also used a number of pseudo orbitals in their icft target description while the darc ones were purely spectroscopic  pseudo - orbitals lead to pseudo - resonances .",
    "they retained 283 levels in their icft close - coupling expansion but 322 levels in their darc one .    we report - on the results of parallel icft and bprm @xmath0-matrix calculations for fe@xmath1 that use the exact same atomic structure ( an 8 configuration interaction expansion ) and the same close - coupling expansion ( 322 levels ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the two ( @xmath22% where @xcite found factors of 3 ) .",
    "we also find excellent agreement with a similar darc calculation which we have carried out .",
    "many of the differences found by @xcite disappear once we correctly label their darc transitions .",
    "some differences remain with their icft results and for which the source is likely one of the possible causes listed in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we describe the key differences between the different @xmath0-matrix methods we use ; in section 3 we give details of both the atomic structure and atomic collision calculations ; in section 4 we present our results and discuss their agreement with and differences from the results of @xcite ; and in section 5 we draw some key conclusions .",
    "relativistic effects can be expected to be important in general for the iron group  just compare energies and radiative data calculated with and without such an allowance . the case for their inclusion in the description of electron - impact excitation at low stages of ionization",
    "is less clear .",
    "the iron project argued @xcite that algebraic recoupling of @xmath23-coupling scattering matrices alone was sufficient to determine level - resolved collision data and adopted such an approach .",
    "essentially this is because electron - impact excitation is mediated by a two - body operator while the dominant fine - structure operator is one - body .",
    "only more recently @xcite has it become practical to carry - out similarly sized @xmath0-matrix calculations which include relativistic interactions explicitly .",
    "large differences with the earlier iron project results have been noted @xcite but it is difficult to separate out the difference due to the choice of the collision representation from the difference due to the differing atomic structure representations adopted . obtaining a sufficiently accurate atomic structure is itself a non - trivial exercise for these ions .",
    "relativistic interactions can be included using either the breit - pauli ( bprm ) or dirac atomic ( darc ) @xmath0-matrix codes .",
    "a full dirac treatment is not necessary here ( @xmath24 ) but the darc suite of codes has lent itself more readily to large - scale parallelization .",
    "level - resolved @xmath0-matrix inner - region codes lead to the need to diagonalize large hamiltonians ( e.g. rank @xmath25 ) and to solve a large set of coupled equations ( e.g. @xmath26 ) in the @xmath0-matrix outer region .",
    "the bprm method lends itself to useful approximation because the scattering problem is set - up initially in term - resolved @xmath23-coupling and subsequently transformed to level - resolved @xmath27-coupling upon the addition of fine - structure relativistic operators ( e.g. spin - orbit ) .",
    "if the relativistic operators are not too large then they can be treated perturbatively .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix ii approach @xcite diagonalizes the @xmath23-coupling scattering hamiltonian and then transforms the resulting eigen - vectors ( surface amplitudes ) to @xmath27-coupling .",
    "it allows for relativistic effects through a further transformation which makes use of term coupling coefficients @xcite .",
    "the outer region problem is then solved as in the original bprm method .",
    "this reduces the computational time ( for the diagonalization ) by an order of magnitude or allows a much larger scattering expansion to be used instead .    the intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) @xmath0-matrix method @xcite goes a step further .",
    "it solves the outer region coupled channel problem in @xmath23-coupling as well .",
    "it then transforms ( asymptotically ) the scattering or reactance matrices to @xmath27-coupling and again uses term coupling coefficients .",
    "the icft method is an order of magnitude more efficient in the outer region as well .",
    "it does require that it is sufficiently accurate to delay the treatment of fine - structure relativistic effects until reaching asymptopia .",
    "the original comparisons @xcite between the results of icft and bprm calculations demonstrated agreement between the maxwellian - averaged collision strengths to within a few percent .",
    "this is well within the uncertainties for complex ions which are introduced by truncating both the target configuration interaction expansion and the close - coupling scattering expansion .",

    "we close with the observation that if we neglect fine - structure relativistic effects completely then our resulting pure algebraic @xmath62 recoupling effective collision strengths agree with our icft ones to within 20% except for excitation of the @xmath12 level for which the difference is a factor of 2 .",
    "they are also in good accord with similar algebraic recoupling results of @xcite including for the @xmath12 now ( not shown ) .",
