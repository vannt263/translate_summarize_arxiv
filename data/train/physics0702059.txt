    "the current frequency standard is based on the ground state hyperfine transition in @xmath9 which is in the microwave regime and has an uncertainty of one part in @xmath10 @xcite . however , there is a search for even more accurate clocks in the optical regime .",
    "the uncertainty of these clocks is expected to be about 1 part in @xmath11 or @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "indeed detailed studies on these ions will have to be carried out in order to determine their suitability for optical frequency standards .",
    "in a recent article @xcite gill and margolis have discussed the merits of choosing @xmath5 as a candidate for an optical clock . till recently , the most accurate measurement of an optical frequency was for the clock transition in @xmath5 which has an uncertainty of @xmath16 parts in @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "when an atom interacts with an external field , the standard frequency may be shifted from the resonant frequency .",
    "the quality of the frequency standard depends upon the accurate and precise measurement of this shift . to minimize or maintain any shift of the clock frequency , the interaction of the atom with it s surroundings must be controlled .",
    "hence , it is important to have a good knowledge of these shifts so as to minimize them while setting up the frequency standard .",
    "some of these shifts are the linear zeeman shift , quadratic zeeman shift , second - order stark shift , hyperfine shift and electric quadrupole shift .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in frequency shift arises from the electric quadrupole shift of the clock transition because of the interaction of atomic electric quadrupole moment with the gradient of external electric field . in this article",
    "we have applied relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) theory , one of the most accurate atomic many - body theories to calculate the electric quadrupole moment ( eqm ) and the hyperfine constants for the energy levels involved in the clock transition .",
    "the relativistic and dynamical electron correlation effects can be incorporated in many - electron systems through a variety of many - body methods @xcite . the relativistic coupled cluster ( rcc ) method has emerged as one of the most powerful and effective tools for high precision description of electron correlations in many - electron systems @xcite .",
    "the rcc is an all - order non - perturbative scheme , and therefore , the higher order electron correlation effects can be incorporated more efficiently than using the order - by - order diagrammatic many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "rcc is equivalent to all order relativistic mbpt ( rmbpt ) .",
    "the rcc results can therefore be improved by adding the important omitted diagrams with the aid of low order rmbpt .",
    "we have applied rcc theory to calculate atomic properties for several systems and more details can be obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we present a brief outline of rcc theory .",

    "is given by    @xmath32    @xmath33 and @xmath34 being the amplitudes corresponding to single and double excitations respectively .",
    "for a single valence system like @xmath3 , the excitation operator for the valence sector turns out to be @xmath35 and    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the single and double excitation amplitudes for the valence sectors respectively . in eqs .",
    "( [ core - t ] ) and ( [ open - s ] ) we denote the core ( virtual ) orbitals by @xmath39 respectively and @xmath40 corresponds to the valence orbital .",

    "@xmath43 . then by using the excitation operators for both the core and valence electron the @xmath44 electron exact state",
    "is defined as @xcite :    @xmath45    we write the expectation value of any operator @xmath46 in a normalized form with respect to the exact state @xmath47 as    @xmath48    for computational simplicity we store only the one - body matrix element of @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 may be expressed in terms of uncontracted single - particle lines @xcite .",

    "the largest source of systematic frequency shift for the clock transition in @xmath3 arises from the electric quadrupole shift of the @xmath4 state caused by its electric quadrupole moment of that state and the interaction of the external electric field gradient present at the position of the ion .",
    "the electric quadrupole moment in the state @xmath19 was measured experimentally by barwood _",
    "_ at npl @xcite .",
    "since the ground state @xmath61 does not possess any electric quadrupole moment , the contribution to the quadrupole shift for the clock frequency comes only from the @xmath19 state .",
    "the interaction of the atomic quadrupole moment with the external electric - field gradient is analogous to the interaction of a nuclear quadrupole moment with the electric fields generated by the atomic electrons inside the nucleus . in the presence of the electric field , this gives rise to an energy shift by coupling with the gradient of the electric field .",

    "hyperfine effects arise due to the interaction between the various moments of the nucleus and the electrons of an atom .",
    "nuclear spin gives rise to a nuclear magnetic dipole moment which interacts with the electrons and thus gives rise to magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction defined by the magnetic dipole hyperfine constant @xmath6 .",

    "the occupied and the virtual orbitals used in the calculation are obtained by solving the dirac - fock ( df ) equation for @xmath114 for a finite fermi nuclear distribution .",
    "these orbitals are linear combinations of gaussian type functions on a grid @xcite .",
    "the open shell coupled cluster ( oscc ) method is used to construct different single valence states whose reference states correspond to adding a particle to the closed shell reference state .",
    "we use the singles - doubles and partial triples approximation , abbreviated as ccsd(t ) and excitations from all the core orbitals have been considered .",
    "we have estimated the error incurred in our present work , by taking the difference between our rcc calculations with singles , doubles as well as the most important triple excitations ( ccsd(t ) ) and only single and double excitations ( ccsd ) .",
    "we present our results of the electric quadrupole moment for the @xmath19 state of @xmath5 in table [ quad - result ] .",
    "the value of @xmath62 in the @xmath19 state measured experimentally is @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "our calculated value for the @xmath19 stretched state is @xmath116 , where @xmath105 is the electronic charge and @xmath117 is the bohr radius .",
    "we analysed our results and have found that the ddf contribution is the largest .",
    "the leading contribution to electron correlation comes from the dpc effects and the dcp effects are an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this can be understood from the dpc diagram ( fig.[cc - diag](a ) ) which has a valence electron in the @xmath118 state .",
    "hence the dominant contribution to the electric quadrupole moment arises from the overlap between virtual @xmath119 orbitals and the valence , owing to the fact that @xmath120 is an operator of rank 0 and the electric quadrupole matrix elements for the valence @xmath118 and the diffuse virtual @xmath119 orbitals are substantial . on the other hand , in the dcp diagram ( fig.[cc - diag](b+c ) ) , the matrix element of the same operator could also involve the less diffuse @xmath121 or @xmath122 orbitals .",
    "hence , for a property like the electric quadrupole moment , whose magnitude depends on the square of the radial distance from the nucleus , this trend seems reasonable , whereas for properties like hyperfine interaction which is sensitive to the near nuclear region , the trend is just the opposite for the @xmath123 states @xcite .",
    "as expected , the contribution of the dhopc effect i.e. , @xmath124 ( fig.[cc - diag](d ) ) is relatively important as it involves an electric quadrupole matrix element between the valence @xmath118 and a virtual @xmath119 orbital .",

    "[ cc - diag ] it is clear that the dpc effect involves the hyperfine interaction of a valence electron and the residual coulomb interaction , i.e for @xmath126 state the hyperfine matrix element becomes @xmath1275s_{1/2}\\left|h_{hfs}\\right|[4p^{6}]q\\right\\rangle $ ] , where @xmath128 can be any virtual orbital and @xmath129 is the single - particle hyperfine operator . since only @xmath130 and",
    "@xmath131 electrons have a sizable density in the nuclear region , the dpc effect is dominant for @xmath132 state but not for the @xmath118 state .",
    "on the other hand , the dcp effects represent the hyperfine interaction of a polarized core electron with any virtual electron ( see fig .",
    "[ cc - diag]b , c ) . for @xmath118 state",
    "it is clear that the hyperfine matrix element for the dpc effect is much smaller than the dcp effect , which plays the most important role in determining the value of @xmath6 .",
    "the core polarization contribution is so large for this state that it even dominates over the ddf contribution .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed an _ ab initio _ calculation of the electric quadrupole moment for the @xmath19 state of @xmath5 to an accuracy of less than @xmath133 using the rcc theory .",
    "this is the first application of rcc theory to determine the electric quadrupole moment ( eqm ) of any atom and is currently the most accurate determination of eqm for the @xmath19 state in @xmath3 .",
    "we have also calculated the magnetic dipole ( @xmath6 ) hyperfine constant for the @xmath61 and @xmath19 states and electric quadrupole hyperfine constant ( @xmath7 ) for the @xmath19 state of @xmath79 .",
