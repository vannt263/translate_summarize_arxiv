    "there is probably no chance of such a generalization ; however , for the case of _ group actions on circles _ , we believe some elements of the theory can be developed .    associated to a linear representation @xmath1 is a trace @xmath2 . given @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "a trace is determined by its values on finitely many @xmath5 , and for each @xmath5 the value @xmath6 is an invariant of the conjugacy class of @xmath7 .",
    "associated to a nonlinear representation @xmath8 one has the _ rotation number _ @xmath9 , and for each @xmath5 the value @xmath10 is a ( complete ) invariant of the _ semi - conjugacy _ class of @xmath7 ( i.e. the equivalence relation generated by dynamical semi - conjugacy ) .    given a group @xmath4 and a collection of elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xmath4 , we would like to know what possible dynamics can be achieved by @xmath12 under representations of @xmath4 into @xmath0 for which the @xmath11 have prescribed dynamics , either in the form of a constraint on the rotation numbers of the @xmath11 , or by imposing the condition that the @xmath11 are conjugate to rotations through prescribed angles . a good theory",
    "should make it possible to _ compute _ these values .",
    "in fact , it is one of the main goals of this paper to develop tools to allow one to describe the shadows ( i.e the projections under @xmath13 ) of such `` algebraic '' subsets of @xmath14 , at least for @xmath4 free , or a free product of cyclic groups .",
    "one significant point of difference between characters and rotation numbers is that it is _ not _ true that knowing the rotation numbers of finitely many elements suffices to determine the rest .",
    "the following example depends on knowledge of some elementary facts about hyperbolic structures on surfaces ; see e.g. @xcite for a reference .",
    "consider a family of representations of @xmath15 into @xmath16 ( which acts on @xmath17 ) associated to a family of ( incomplete ) hyperbolic structures on a once - punctured torus .",
    "we identify @xmath15 with the fundamental group of this torus , so that the generators @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the meridian and longitude , and the commutator @xmath20 $ ] corresponds to the puncture .    at the complete finite area structure , every element is hyperbolic or parabolic , and therefore every element has rotation number @xmath21 ( mod @xmath22 ) .",

    "however , for every finite collection of elements not conjugate to a power of @xmath20 $ ] , the image stays hyperbolic , and the rotation number stays zero , for sufficiently small perturbations .",
    "moreover , there is a 2 parameter family of deformations of the hyperbolic structure keeping the cone structure near the puncture fixed , and under such a deformation some elements switch from hyperbolic to elliptic or back .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is a certain sense in which knowledge of _ all _ rotation numbers together with certain homological data _ does _ determine a representation , again up to the relation of semi - conjugacy .",
    "the precise statement is due to ghys @xcite and is further refined by matsumoto @xcite , and can be expressed in terms of the `` euler class in integral bounded cohomology '' ; since a proper discussion of this would take us too far afield , we do not pursue it here .    if it is not true that finitely many rotation numbers determine the rest , it is nevertheless true that the rotation numbers of ( say ) the generators strongly _ constrain _ the rotation numbers of the other elements , and in quite an interesting way . the main problem on which we focus in this paper is therefore the following :    given a free group @xmath24 , and an element @xmath25 of @xmath24 , and given values of the rotation numbers of the generators , what is the set of possible rotation numbers of @xmath25 ?",
    "we are especially focussed on the special case that @xmath25 is a _ positive _ word in the generators of @xmath24 ; i.e. it is contained in the _ semigroup _ they generate . in this case",
    "the theory simplifies significantly , and we are able to obtain strong results .",
    "one of the best known and best studied examples of nonlinear phase locking in dynamics is the phenomenon of _",
    "arnold tongues _ : the introduction of nonlinear noise into a family of circle homeomorphisms tends to produce _ periodic orbits _ ; informally , we call this the phenomenon of _ greedy rationals_. in this paper we are concerned with another manifestation of this phenomenon , in the context of _ nonabelian group dynamics_. we find strong constraints on the dynamics of free group actions on the circle that maximize certain dynamical quantities , and in many case show that these these constraints are powerful enough to guarantee periodic orbits and therefore rational rotation numbers .",
    "the classification of taut foliations of seifert fibered @xmath26-manifolds was the culmination of the work of many people , including thurston , brittenham , eisenbud , hirsch , jankins , neumann and others , and was completed by naimi @xcite by proving an outstanding conjecture of jankins ",

    "the results in our paper are proved for actions of a free group of rank 2 on the circle .",
    "however , the generalization to arbitrary rank is straightforward .",
    "statements of the main theorems for arbitrary rank can be found in the appendix ; the proofs are routine generalizations of the proofs given in the paper for the rank 2 case , and are left to the reader .    ",

    "the stability theorem shows that the sizes of these tongues decrease with @xmath55 , but experiments suggest a sharper relationship @xmath56 .",
    "this seems very exciting to us , and deserves further exploration .",
    "for the special case of @xmath57 , the combinatorics becomes simple enough to allow a complete solution .",
    "this leads to an elementary proof of the following theorem , first conjectured by jankins ",
    "neumann and proved by naimi :    for @xmath58 there is an equality @xmath59    as remarked earlier , this theorem is the last step in the classification of taut foliations of seifert fibered spaces .",
    "if we fix @xmath25 and a rational number @xmath60 , the function @xmath61 is nondecreasing and takes on a discrete set of values ( however , it is typically discontinuous ) .",
    "the next theorem says that this function is continuous from the right , and the points of discontinuity are rational , and can be determined by a finite procedure .",

    "one subtle point is that the set where @xmath49 is _ not _ in general a finite sided rational polyhedron , and can in fact be extremely complicated .      [ arbitrary_word_section ] moves on to the case of arbitrary @xmath25",
    "the rationality theorem generalizes to words @xmath25 which are _ semipositive _ ; i.e. that contain to @xmath41 or no @xmath42 ( theorem  [ semipositive_rational ] ) .",
    "we conjecture ( conjecture  [ rationality_conjecture ] ) that for arbitrary @xmath25 and rational @xmath33 , @xmath39 is rational . given @xmath25 , a compactness argument ( using circular orders rather than actions ) shows that there is a representation with @xmath37 and @xmath38 realizing @xmath70 .",
    "counterfactually , we suppose that @xmath35 is irrational , and then try to modify the dynamics to increase it .",
    "this gives rise to a dynamical problem of independent interest called the _ interval game_. roughly speaking , given a finite collection of homeomorphisms @xmath71 and an irrational number @xmath72 , we would like to find an interval @xmath73 and an integer @xmath74 for which @xmath75 is not contained in @xmath76 for any @xmath77 and any @xmath78 , but @xmath79 . here",

    "it follows that for @xmath25 containing a single @xmath41 , there are strong constraints on the possible irrational values of @xmath39 , in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath44 , namely that they are contained in the complement of an explicit dense @xmath88 .",
