    "the study of space - time integrability properties of the solution of the cauchy problem for the schrdinger equation @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , has been pursued by many authors in the last thirty years .",
    "the celebrated homogeneous strichartz estimates @xcite for the solution @xmath3 read @xmath4 for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , i.e. , for @xmath9 _ schrdinger admissible_. here , as usual , we set @xmath10 as a matter of fact , these estimates express a gain of local @xmath11-regularity of the solution @xmath12 , and a decay of its @xmath13-norm , both in some @xmath14-averaged sense .",
    "in this paper we study similar estimates in spaces which , unlike the @xmath15 spaces , control the local and global behaviour of a function independently ( for example , spaces whose functions are locally in some @xmath15 space whereas globally display a @xmath16-decay , with @xmath17 )",
    ". the wiener amalgam spaces , introduced by h. feichtinger in 1980 @xcite , enjoy this property and are the means to perform such a finer analysis of local integrability and decay at infinity .",
    "for instance , the desired wiener amalgam space in the example above is denoted by @xmath18 ; similarly , one can consider other banach spaces to measure the local behaviour of a function , e.g. , @xmath19 instead of @xmath15 , the related wiener amalgam space being then @xmath20 , and so on .",
    "in general ,",
    "given two ( suitable ) banach function spaces @xmath21 , @xmath22 , the wiener amalgam space @xmath23 is the space of functions which `` locally '' are in @xmath21 and `` globally '' in @xmath22 ( see @xcite and section 2 below for the precise definition ) .    here is a brief discussion of the results proved in this paper . as usual",
    "we first establish an estimate of dispersive type .",
    "namely , in our setting , we prove @xmath24 notice that @xmath25 comparing with the classical dispersive estimate @xcite @xmath26 we therefore get an improvement for every fixed @xmath27 . indeed , we start from less regular data @xmath28 ( for example , a compactly supported radon measure in @xmath29 ) , and we end up with a solution @xmath12 locally in @xmath30 , which is strictly smaller than @xmath31 .",
    "observe that in we recapture the classical time decay @xmath32 as @xmath33 , whereas getting a better result locally in space costs a worsening as @xmath34 : the factor @xmath32 is replaced by @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "next , we focus on space - time estimates . precisely , upon defining the wiener amalgam norms as @xmath37 ( the last equality shall be proved in section 2 ) , our result can be stated as follows .",
    "[ prima ] let @xmath38 , @xmath39 , such that @xmath40 and similarly for @xmath41",

    "for @xmath48 , the result is better than the classical one for large time , while locally we pay that improvement : the classical @xmath14 regularity is replaced by @xmath50 .    in the case",
    "@xmath51 ( included in theorem [ prima ] ) , we recapture the usual estimate @xmath52    from a local point of view , the other cases are not comparable to those of , since here we gain in space ( being @xmath53 for @xmath49 ) but lose in time .",
    "in fact , it is important to observe that , for any given @xmath54 , the inclusion @xmath55 is always _ false _ when @xmath56 , so that estimate can not be deduced from applied to the schrdinger admissible pair @xmath57 , @xmath48 . in other terms , estimate contains information on the oscillations in @xmath11 of the solution , which can not be extracted from .",
    "observe that locally the @xmath58-norm would be obtained with @xmath59 , which corresponds to our endpoint case .",
    "namely , let @xmath60 be the endpoint @xmath61 then our version of the main result of @xcite can be formulated as follows .",

    "a natural question arises : can our results be extended to the case @xmath83 ?",
    "so , for instance , for @xmath84 one would obtain @xmath85 for sure this case can not be treated with the techniques developed here , which use the hardy - littlewood - sobolev s singular integral theory .",
    "the strichartz estimates of theorems [ prima ] and [ endpoint ] can be applied , e.g. , to the well - posedness of non - linear schrdinger equations or of linear schrdinger equations with time - dependent potentials . as an example , in section [ section6 ] we combine our estimates with the methods of @xcite to deduce some estimates for the schrdinger equation with a potential @xmath86 .",
    "we point out that interesting estimates for the operator @xmath87 , for fixed @xmath88 , have been recently obtained in @xcite and @xcite using the framework of modulation spaces .",
