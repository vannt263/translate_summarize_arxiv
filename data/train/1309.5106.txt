    "the eigenvalue statistics of large random hermitian matrices with independent entries are known to exhibit universal behaviour .",
    "wigner proved @xcite that the eigenvalue density converges ( on the macroscopic scale ) to the semicircle law as the dimension of the matrix tends to infinity .",
    "he also observed that the local statistics of individual eigenvalues ( e.g.  the gap statistics ) are universal , in the sense that they depend only on the symmetry class of the matrix but are otherwise independent of the distribution of the matrix entries . in the gaussian case ,",
    "the local spectral statistics were identified by gaudin , mehta , and dyson @xcite , who proved that they are governed by the celebrated sine kernel .    in this paper and its companion @xcite , we focus the universality of the eigenvalue density statistics on intermediate , so - called _ mesoscopic _ , scales , which lie between the macroscopic and the local scales .",
    "we study _ random band matrices _ , commonly used to model quantum transport in disordered media . unlike the mean - field wigner matrices ,",
    "band matrices possess a nontrivial spatial structure .",
    "apart from the obvious mathematical interest , an important motivation for this question arises from physics , namely from the theory of conductance fluctuations developed by thouless @xcite . in the next sections we explain the physical background of the problem .",
    "thus , readers mainly interested in the mathematical aspects of our results may skip much of the introduction .      according to the anderson metal - insulator transition @xcite , general disordered quantum systems are believed to fall into one of two very distinctive regimes . in the _ localized regime _ ( also called the _ insulator regime _ ) , physical quantities depending on the position , such as eigenvectors and resolvent entries , decay on a length scale @xmath0 ( called the _ localization length _ ) that is independent of the system size . the unitary time evolution generated by the hamiltonian",
    "remains localized for all times and the local spectral statistics are poisson . in contrast , in the _ delocalized regime _",
    "( also called the _ metallic regime _ ) , the localization length is comparable with the linear system size .",
    "the overlap of the eigenvectors induces strong correlations in the local eigenvalue statistics , which are believed to be universal and to coincide with those of a gaussian matrix ensemble of the appropriate symmetry class .",
    "moreover , the unitary time evolution generated by the hamiltonian is diffusive for large times .",
    "strongly disordered systems are in the localized regime . in the weak disorder regime ,",
    "the localization properties depend on the dimension and on the energy .    despite compelling theoretical arguments and numerical evidence ,",
    "the anderson metal - insulator transition has been rigorously proved only in a few very special cases .",
    "the basic model is the random schrdinger operator , @xmath1 , typically defined on @xmath2 or on a graph ( e.g.  on a subset of @xmath3 ) . here",
    "@xmath4 is a random potential with short - range spatial correlations ; for instance , in the case of a graph , @xmath4 is a family of independent random variables indexed by the vertices .",
    "the localized regime is relatively well understood since the pioneering work of frhlich and spencer @xcite , followed by an alternative approach by aizenman and molchanov @xcite .",
    "the poissonian nature of the local spectral statistics was proved by minami @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the delocalized regime has seen far less progress . with the exception of the bethe lattice @xcite ,",
    "only partial results are available .",
    "they indicate delocalization and quantum diffusion in certain limiting regimes @xcite , or in a somewhat different model where the static random potential is replaced with a dynamic phonon field in a thermal state at positive temperature @xcite .",
    "another much studied family of models describing disordered quantum systems is random matrices .",
    "delocalization is well understood for random wigner matrices @xcite , but , owing to their mean - field character , they are always in the delocalized regime , and hence no phase transition takes place .",
    "the local eigenvalue statistics are universal .",
    "this fundamental fact about random matrices , also known as the wigner - dyson - mehta conjecture , has been recently proved @xcite ( see also @xcite for a partially alternative argument in the hermitian case ) .      in a seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "altshuler and shklovskii computed a new physical quantity : the variance of the number @xmath5 of eigenvalues on a mesoscopic energy scale @xmath6 in @xmath7-dimensional metallic samples with disorder for @xmath8 ; here _ mesoscopic _ refers to scales @xmath6 that are much larger then the typical eigenvalue spacing @xmath9 but much smaller than the total ( macroscopic ) energy scale of the system .",
    "their motivation was to study fluctuations of the conductance in mesoscopic metallic samples ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath10 and the conductance is given by a fundamental result of thouless @xcite , asserting that the conductance of a sample of linear size @xmath11 is determined by the ( one - particle ) energy levels in an energy band of a specific width @xmath6 around the fermi energy .",
    "in particular , the variance of @xmath12 directly contributes to the conductance fuctuations .",
    "this specific value of @xmath6 is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the temperature and @xmath15 is the _ thouless energy _",
    "@xcite . in diffusive models",
    "the thouless energy is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "( in a conductor the dynamics of the particles , i.e.  the itinerant electrons , is typically diffusive . )",
    "the thouless energy may also be interpreted as the inverse diffusion time , i.e.  the time needed for the particle to diffuse through the sample .    as it turns out , the mesoscopic linear statistics @xmath10 undergo a sharp transition precisely at to indicate that @xmath18 and @xmath19 have comparable size .",
    "see the conventions at the end of section [ sec : intro ] . ]",
    "for small energy scales , @xmath21 , altshuler and shklovskii found that the variance of @xmath10 behaves according to to denote the covariance and abbreviate @xmath22 .",
    "see below . ] @xmath23 as predicted by the dyson - mehta statistics @xcite .",
    "the unusually small variance is due to the strong correlations among eigenvalues ( arising from level repulsion ) . in the opposite regime , @xmath24 ,",
    "the variance is typically much larger , and behaves according to @xmath25    the threshold @xmath15 may be understood by introducing the concept of ( an energy - dependent ) _ diffusion length _",
    "@xmath26 , which is the typical spatial scale on which the off - diagonal matrix entries of those observables decay that live on an energy scale @xmath6 ( e.g.  resolvents whose spectral parameters have imaginary part @xmath6 ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath26 is the linear scale of an initially localized state evolved up to time @xmath27 .",
    "the diffusion length is related to the localization length @xmath0 through @xmath28 .",
    "assuming that the dynamics of the quantum particle can be described by a classical diffusion process , one can show that @xmath29 and the relation @xmath30 may be written as @xmath31 .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the sample is so small that the system is essentially mean - field from the point of view of observables on the energy scale @xmath6 , so that the spatial structure and dimensionality of the system are immaterial .",
    "the opposite regime @xmath24 corresponds to large samples , @xmath32 , where the behaviour of the system can be approximated by a diffusion that has not reached the boundary of the sample .",
    "these two regimes are commonly referred to as _ mean - field _ and _ diffusive _ regimes , respectively .",
    "a similar transition occurs if one considers the correlation of the number of eigenvalues @xmath33 and @xmath34 around two distinct energies @xmath35 whose separation is much larger than the energy window @xmath6 ( i.e.  @xmath36 ) . for small samples , @xmath37 , the correlation decays according to @xmath38 this decay holds for systems both with and without time reversal symmetry .",
    "the decay is in agreement with the dyson - mehta statistics , which in the complex hermitian case ( corresponding to a system without time reversal symmetry ) predict a correlation @xmath39 for highly localized observables on the scale @xmath40 . for mesoscopic scales , @xmath41 ,",
    "the oscillations in the numerator are averaged out and may be replaced with a positive constant to yield .",
    "a similar formula with the same decay holds for the real symmetric case ( corresponding to a system with time reversal symmetry ) . on the other hand , for large samples , @xmath24",
    ", we have @xmath42 for @xmath43 the correlation vanishes to leading order .",
    "the power laws in the energies @xmath6 and @xmath44 given in and respectively are called the _ altshuler - shklovskii formulas_. they express the variance and the correlation of the density of states in the regime where the diffusion approximation is valid and the spatial extent of the diffusion , @xmath26 , is much less than the system size @xmath11 . in contrast , the mean - field formulas and describe the situation where the diffusion has reached equilibrium .",
    "note that the behaviours and as well as and are very different from the ones obtained if the distribution of the eigenvalues were governed by poisson statistics ; in that case , for instance , and would be zero .    from a mathematical point of view , the significance of these mesoscopic quantities is that their statistics are amenable to rigorous analysis even in the delocalized regime . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate this by proving the altshuler - shklovskii formulas for random band matrices .",
    "we consider @xmath7-dimensional random band matrices , which interpolate between random schrdinger operators and mean - field wigner matrices by varying the band width @xmath45 ; see @xcite for an overview of this idea .",
    "these matrices represent quantum systems in a @xmath7-dimensional discrete box of side length @xmath11 , where the quantum transition probabilities are random and their range is of order @xmath46 .",
    "we scale the matrix so that its spectrum is bounded , i.e.  the macroscopic energy scale is of order 1 , and hence the eigenvalue spacing is of order @xmath47 .",
    "band matrices exhibit diffusion in all dimensions @xmath7 , with a diffusion coefficient @xmath48 ; see @xcite for a physical argument in the general case and @xcite for a proof up to certain large time scales . in @xcite",
    "it was showed that the resolvent entries with spectral parameter @xmath49 decay exponentially on a scale @xmath50 , as long as this scale is smaller than the system size , @xmath51 .",
    "( for technical reasons the proof is valid only if @xmath11 is not too large , @xmath52 . )",
    "the resolvent entries do not decay if @xmath53 , in which case the system is in the mean - field regime for observables living on energy scales of order @xmath37 .",
    "notice that the crossover at @xmath54 corresponds exactly to the crossover at @xmath20 mentioned above .",
    "our main result is the proof of the formulas ( with @xmath55 ) and for @xmath7-dimensional band matrices for @xmath56 ; we also obtain similar results for @xmath57 , where the powers of @xmath6 and @xmath44 are replaced with a logarithm .",
    "this rigorously justifies the asymptotics of silvestrov ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 40 ) ) , which in turn reproduced the earlier result of @xcite . for technical reasons",
    ", we have to restrict ourselves to the regime @xmath58 .",
    "for convenience , we also assume that @xmath59 , which guarantees that @xmath60 ( or , equivalently , @xmath24 ) .",
    "hence we work in the diffusive regime .",
    "however , our method may be easily extended to the case @xmath31 as well ( see remark [ rem : diffusion ] and section [ sec : wigner ] below ) .",
    "we also show that for @xmath61 the universality of the formulas and breaks down , and the variance and the correlation functions of @xmath5 depend on the detailed structure of the band matrix .",
    "we also compute the leading correction to the density - density correlation . in summary",
    ", we find that for @xmath62 the leading and subleading terms are universal , for @xmath63 only the leading terms are universal , and for @xmath64 the density - density correlation is not universal .    the case @xmath43 is special , since the coefficient of the leading term in vanishes owing to an algebraic cancellation .",
    "the first non - vanishing term was predicted in @xcite .",
    "we rigorously identify this term in the regime @xmath65 , and find a substantial discrepancy between it and the prediction of @xcite .",
    "for an outline of our proof , and the relation between this paper and its companion @xcite , see section [ sec : struc ] .",
    "our analysis is valid in the mesoscopic regime , i.e.  when @xmath66 , and concerns only density fluctuations . for completeness",
    ", we mention what was previously known in this and other regimes .      in the macroscopic regime , @xmath67 , the quantity @xmath10 should fluctuate on the scale @xmath68 according to . for the wigner case , @xmath69",
    ", it has been proved that a smoothed version of @xmath10 , the linear statistics of eigenvalues @xmath70 , is asymptotically gaussian . the first result in this direction for analytic @xmath71",
    "was given in @xcite , and this was later extended by several authors to more general test functions ; see @xcite for the latest result .",
    "the first central limit theorem for matrices with a nontrivial spatial structure and for polynomial test functions was proved in @xcite .",
    "very recently , it was proved in @xcite for one - dimensional band matrices that , provided that @xmath72 , the quantity @xmath73 is asymptotically gaussian with variance of order @xmath68 . for a complete list of references in this direction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics in the completely mean - field case , corresponding to wigner matrices ( i.e.  @xmath74 so that @xmath75 ) , was proved in @xcite ; see the remarks following theorem  [ thm : wigner ] for more details about this work .",
    "we note that the formula for random band matrices with @xmath76 was derived in @xcite , using an unphysical double limit procedure , in which the limit @xmath77 was first computed for a fixed @xmath6 , and subsequently the limit of small @xmath6 was taken .",
    "note that the mesoscopic correlations can not be recovered after the limit @xmath77 .",
    "hence the result of @xcite describes only the macroscopic , and not the mesoscopic , correlations .",
    "much less is known about the local spectral statistics of random band matrices , even for @xmath76 .",
    "the tracy - widom law at the spectral edge was proved in @xcite .",
    "based on a computation of the localization length , the metal - insulator transition is predicted to occur at @xmath78 ; see @xcite for a non - rigorous argument and @xcite for the best currently known lower and upper bounds .",
    "hence , the local spectral statistics are expected to be governed by the sine kernel from random matrix theory in the regime @xmath79 .",
    "very recently , the sine kernel was proved @xcite for a special hermitian gaussian random band matrix with band width @xmath45 comparable with @xmath11 .",
    "universality for a more general class of band matrices but with an additional tiny mean - field component was proved in @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the local correlations of determinants of a special hermitian gaussian random band matrix have been shown to follow the sine kernel @xcite , up to the expected threshold @xmath80 .",
    "the diagrammatic calculation of @xcite uses the diffusion approximation , and formulas  are supposed to be valid in the delocalized regime .",
    "nevertheless , our results also hold in the localized regime , in particular even @xmath76 and for @xmath81 , in which case the eigenvectors are known to be localized @xcite . in this regime , and for @xmath82 , we also prove and .",
    "both formulas show that poisson statistics do not hold on large mesoscopic scales , despite the system being in the localized regime . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath10 were poisson - distributed , then we would have @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "gives @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude that the prediction of for the magnitude of @xmath85 is much smaller than that predicted by poisson statistics provided that @xmath86 .",
    "the fact that the poisson statistics breaks down on mesoscopic scales is not surprising .",
    "indeed , the basic intuition behind the emergence of poisson statistics is that eigenvectors belonging to different eigenvalues are exponentially localized on a scale @xmath87 , typically at different spatial locations .",
    "hence the associated eigenvalues are independent . for larger @xmath6 , however , the observables depend on many eigenvalues , which exhibit nontrivial correlations since the supports of their eigenvectors overlap .",
    "a simple counting argument shows that such overlaps become significant if @xmath88 , at which point correlations are expected to develop . in other words ,",
    "we expect a transition to / from poisson statistics at @xmath89 . in the previous paragraph",
    ", we noted that predicts a transition in the behaviour of @xmath10 to / from poisson statistics at @xmath90 . combining these observations",
    ", we therefore expect a transition to / from poisson statistics for @xmath87 .",
    "this argument predicts the correct localization length @xmath87 without resorting to grassmann integration .",
    "it remains on a heuristic level , however , since our results do not cover the full range @xmath91 .",
    "we note that this argument may also be applied to @xmath92 , in which case it predicts the absence of a transition provided that @xmath93 .",
    "the main conclusion of our results is that the local eigenvalue statistics , characterized by either poisson or sine kernel statistics , do not in general extend to mesoscopic scales .",
    "on mesoscopic scales , a different kind of universality emerges , which is expressed by the altshuler - shklovskii formulas .",
    "we use @xmath94 to denote a generic large positive constant , which may depend on some fixed parameters and whose value may change from one expression to the next . similarly",
    ", we use @xmath95 to denote a generic small positive constant .",
    "we use @xmath96 to mean @xmath97 for some constants @xmath98 .",
    "also , for any finite set @xmath99 we use @xmath100 to denote the cardinality of @xmath99 .",

    "the case * ( c2 ) * for our test functions is the more important one , since we are typically interested in the statistics of eigenvalues contained in an interval of size @xmath6 .",
    "the cauchy kernel from the case * ( c1 ) * has a heavy tail , which introduces unwanted correlations arising from the overlap of the test functions and not from the long - distance correlations that we are interested in .",
    "nevertheless , we give our results also for the special case * ( c1)*. we do this for two reasons .",
    "first , the case * ( c1 ) * is pedagogically useful , since it results in a considerably simpler computation of the main term ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "it turns out that these phases @xmath102 depend strongly on the type of bridge they belong to .",
    "we split the set of skeleton bridges @xmath695 into the `` domestic bridges '' which join edges within the same component of @xmath425 and `` connecting bridges '' which join edges in different components of @xmath425 ; see definition [ def_split_sigma ] below for more details .",

    "now we explain how the estimate on @xmath692 can be improved if @xmath514 _ is not a dumbbell skeleton_. we rely on two simple but fundamental observations . first , if @xmath514 does not saturate the 2/3-rule then the right - hand side of contains an extra power of @xmath728 as compared to the leading term .",
    "second , if @xmath514 saturates the 2/3-rule and is not a dumbbell skeleton then @xmath514 must contain a domestic bridge ( joining edges within the same component of @xmath425 ) .",

    ". moreover , theorem [ thm : main result ] follows from and lemma [ lem : ey ] .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorems [ thm : main result][thm : theta 1 ] under the simplifications * ( s1)**(s3)*.",
    "in this section we explain the changes needed to the arguments of section [ sec : main argument ] to prove theorems [ thm : main result ] , [ thm : theta 2 ] , and [ thm : theta 1 ] for @xmath120 instead of @xmath123 .",
    "the difference is that for @xmath120 we have @xmath952 , while for @xmath123 we have @xmath462 ( in addition to @xmath953 , which is valid in both cases ) .",
    "this leads to additional terms for @xmath120 , which may be conveniently tracked in our graphical notation by introducing _",
    "twisted bridges _ , in analogy to section 9 of @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , allowing twisted bridges results in eight new dumbbell skeletons , called @xmath954 below , each of which has the same value @xmath955 as its counterpart without a tilde .",
    "hence , for @xmath120 the leading term is simply twice the leading term of @xmath123 , which accounts for the trivial prefactor @xmath956 in the final formulas .",
    "any other skeleton may be estimated by a trivial modification of the argument from sections [ sec : large_sigma][proof : small_sigma ] . as in section",
    "[ sec : main argument ] , we make the simplifications * ( s1)**(s3 ) * , and do not deal with the errors terms @xmath389 resulting from them .",
    "they are handled in @xcite .",
    "we now give a more precise account of the proof for @xmath120 .",
    "we start from , which remains unchanged .",
    "since @xmath957 , holds for @xmath120 without the indicator function @xmath958 that was present for @xmath123 .",
    "hence also holds without the indicator function @xmath958 .",
    "we now write @xmath959 = [ x_{e ' } ] ) } \\;=\\ ; { { \\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{1 } } } ( [ x_e ] = [ x_{e ' } ] ) } { { \\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{1 } } } ( x_e \\neq x_{e ' } ) } + { { \\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{1 } } } ( x_e = x_{e ' } ) } \\;{=\\mathrel{\\vcenter{\\baselineskip0.65ex \\lineskiplimit0pt \\hbox{.}\\hbox{.}}}}\\ ; j_{\\{e , e'\\}}({\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x } } } ) + { \\widetilde}j_{\\{e , e'\\}}({\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}})\\,,\\ ] ] in self - explanatory notation ( recall that @xmath960 was already defined in ) . thus becomes @xmath961 multiplying out the parentheses in yields @xmath962 terms ,",
    "each of which is characterized by the set of bridges of @xmath466 associated with a factor @xmath963 ; the other bridges are associated with a factor @xmath964 .",
    "we call the former _ straight bridges _ and the latter _ twisted bridges_. this terminology originates from the fact that a twisted bridge forces the labels of the adjacent vertices to coincide on opposite sides of the bridge ; see figure [ fig : twisted bridges ] for an illustration .",
    "next , we extend the definition of skeletons from section [ sec_42 ] to pairings containing twisted bridges . recall that the key observation behind the definition of a skeleton was that parallel straight bridges yield a large contribution but a small combinatorial complexity .",
    "now _ antiparallel _ twisted bridges behave analogously , whereby two bridges @xmath507 and @xmath508 are _ antiparallel _ if @xmath509 and @xmath965 .",
    "( recall that they are parallel if @xmath509 and @xmath510 . )",
    "see figure [ fig : twisted bridges ] for an illustration .",
    "antiladder _ is a sequence of bridges such that two consecutive bridges are antiparallel .",
    "all of section [ sec_41 ] , in particular the partition @xmath487 , may now be taken over with trivial modifications .",
    "as in section [ sec_42 ] , to each tagged pairing @xmath466 we assign a tagged skeleton @xmath514 with associated multiplicities @xmath522 . the skeleton @xmath514 is obtained from @xmath466 by successively collapsing _ parallel straight bridges _ and _ antiparallel twisted bridges _ until none remains .",
    "parallel twisted bridges and antiparallel straight bridges remain unaltered .",
    "the skeleton @xmath514 inherits the tagging of its bridges in the natural way : two parallel straight bridges are collapsed into a single straight bridge , and two antiparallel twisted bridges are collapsed into a single twisted bridge .",
    "see figure [ fig : twisted skeleton ] for an illustration .        allowing twisted bridges leads to a further eight skeleton graphs , which we denote by @xmath954 , whose contribution is of leading order .",
    "they are the same graphs as @xmath233 from figure [ fig : dumbbell ] , except that the ( one or two ) vertical antiparallel straight bridges ( depicted by solid lines ) are replaced with the same number of vertical parallel twisted bridges ( depicted by dashed lines ) .",
    "we use the notations @xmath966 we record the following simple result , whose proof is immediate .",
    "what remains is the estimate of @xmath619 for @xmath969 .",
    "we proceed exactly as in sections [ sec : large_sigma][proof : small_sigma ] .",
    "the key observation is that the 2/3-rule from lemma [ lem:2/3_rule ] remains true thanks to the definition of skeletons .",
    "when estimating the large skeletons ( without making use of oscillations ) in section [ sec : large_sigma ] , we get an extra factor @xmath970 to the left - hand side of arising from the sum over all possible taggings of a skeleton ; this factor is clearly immaterial .",
    "finally , the argument of sections [ sec : small_skeletons ] and [ proof : small_sigma ] may be taken over with merely cosmetic changes .",
    "the set @xmath856 from definition [ def_s^1 ] remains unchanged , and in particular only contains straight bridges .",
    "note that the basic graph - theoretic argument from lemmas [ lem : saturated2/3 ] and [ lem : non_saturated2/3 ] remains unchanged .",
    "in particular , exactly as in the proof of lemma [ lem : saturated2/3 ] , if all blocks of @xmath524 have size three and @xmath514 is not a dumbbell skeleton , then @xmath514 contains a domestic bridge ( which may be straight or twisted ) .",
