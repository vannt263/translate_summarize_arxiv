    "quasar absorption line systems provide a distance - independent means of studying baryonic matter cosmologically distributed throughout the universe . the neutral hydrogen column density distribution function for these systems",
    "can be characterized roughly by a single power - law between 10@xmath2 @xmath3 and 10@xmath4 @xmath3 , with an index of @xmath51.5 .",
    "( tytler 1987 ) .",
    "the implication is that absorption line systems with neutral hydrogen column densities greater than 10@xmath6 @xmath3 are very rare : for every 1000 absorption line systems with n(hi ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath3 there is one system with n(hi ) @xmath9 10@xmath6 @xmath3 .",
    "although the highest column density systems are rare , study of these systems is critical to our understanding of the high redshift universe for a number of reasons , including :    * most of the neutral baryonic material at high redshift may reside in the highest column density systems ( lanzetta et al .",
    "* the very high column systems are thought to be absorption by gas associated with the pre - cursors of present day disk galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "* obscuration by dust associated with the high column density systems may affect the observed statistics of quasar populations at high redshifts , and perhaps more significantly , the observed statistics of the cosmic evolution of the neutral baryon density ( fall &  pei 1995 ) . * perhaps most importantly in the cases of radio loud background sources , the high column density systems allow studies of the hi 21 cm line in absorption , and in the more extreme cases , of associated molecular absorption at high redshift .",
    "spectroscopic imaging at radio wavelengths of molecular and hi 21 cm absorption line systems opens a new window into the physics of these systems , including detailed studies of astrochemistry at high redshift , and new methods for determining basic cosmological parameters such as the evolution of the temperature of the microwave background radiation and the deuterium abundance .",
    "these systems probe the dense , pre - star - forming interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies at substantial look - back times .",
    "background radio continuum sources typically show spatial structure on scales ranging from parsecs to kilo - parsecs .",
    "radio interferometers allow for direct spectroscopic imaging of the spatial structure in the absorbing gas over this entire range of spatial scales .",
    "also , radio spectroscopy allows for study of the velocity structure in the absorption lines down to 10 m s@xmath10 .",
    "over the last few years we have developed an effective technique for discovering very high column density quasar absorption line systems by searching for redshifted hi 21 cm absorption toward flat spectrum radio sources with faint , red optical counterparts .",
    "the physical basis for selecting these ` red quasars ' for radio absorption searches is the hypothesis that these sources are red due to dust obscuration .",
    "dust obscuration leads to a natural bias against finding the highest column density absorbers using optical techniques in two ways : ( i ) sources may drop out of optical magnitude limited samples due to dust obscuration , and ( ii ) follow - up optical spectroscopy typically requires fairly bright , blue objects ( heisler &  ostriker 1988 , fall &  pei 1993 , webster et al .",
    "1995 , shaver et al . 1996 ) .",
    "hence , radio spectroscopy may provide the _ only method _ for studying the very highest column density quasar absorption line systems , as has long been the case for studies of the early stages of star formation in galactic dark molecular clouds .",
    "in this paper we present a summary of recent detections of redshifted neutral hydrogen 21 cm absorption toward red quasars using the new uhf system at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , and the nrao 140 ft telescope in green bank wv ( see carilli et al .",

    "these observations are intended to address a number of issues .",
    "first , we want to address the question whether some agns have intrinsically red , rather than dust - reddened , spectra .",
    "second is the question of the fraction of quasars missing from optical samples due to dust obscuration , as well as the fraction of missing high column density quasar absorption line systems .",
    "third , we wish to enlarge the sample of dusty , high column density absorption line systems in order to study the dense ism in galaxies at significant look - back times",
    ". an earlier review of redshifted hi 21 cm absorption line systems can be found in carilli ( 1995 ) .",

    "the resulting sample of very high column density absorption line systems detected in the radio via hi 21 cm absorption and/or molecular absorption , falls into two classes : ( i ) associated absorbers , ie .",
    "absorption by gas in the host galaxy of the quasar , and ( ii ) cosmologically intervening absorbers . for the associated absorbers the gas can be either ` circumnuclear material ' directly associated with the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , or gas in the general ism of the agn host galaxy . for the cosmologically intervening systems the interesting trend has arisen that many of these systems are gravitational lenses .",
    "in retrospect the association of lensing with very high column density absorbers may not be surprising , since high column density absorption requires a fairly small impact parameter on the intervening galaxy .",
    "the surprise has been that many gravitational lenses are gas rich systems , as opposed to the original naive hypothesis that most lenses would be gas poor elliptical galaxies .",

    "the large velocity dispersion of this gas ( fwhm @xmath20 300 km s@xmath10 ) suggests absorption by circumnuclear material .",

    "a possible model to explain all these data is that the quasar is a background source which projects off - center from the z = 0.5834 galaxy .",
    "the large velocity offset of the hi line relative to the galaxy , and the large velocity dispersion , would then be explained by galactic rotation .",

    "still , the red quasar data support the basic conclusions of fall and pei ( 1993 ) : ( i ) there may be a significant , but not dominant , population of quasars missing from optically selected samples due to obscuration , perhaps as high as 20@xmath0 at the poss limit for an optical sample with a redshift distribution similar to the 1 jy , flat spectrum quasar sample , and ( ii ) optically selected samples may miss about half the high column density quasar absorption line systems . a final point made by fall and pei",

    "<S> the data on the red quasar sub - sample support the models of fall &  pei for dust obscuration by damped ly@xmath1 absorption line systems , and suggest that : ( i ) there may be a significant , but not dominant , population of quasars missing from optically selected samples due to dust obscuration , perhaps as high as 20@xmath0 at the poss limit for an optical sample with a redshift distribution similar to the 1 jy , flat spectrum quasar sample , and ( ii ) optically selected samples may miss about half the high column density quasar absorption line systems . </S>"
