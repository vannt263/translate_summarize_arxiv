    "among various classes of fe - based superconductors , the highest superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 exceeding 50  k is realized exclusively in the @xmath0feaso(f ) system ( @xmath0 : lanthanide elements ) .",
    "@xcite it is empirically known that @xmath2 of @xmath0feaso correlates strongly with the crystal structure and becomes maximum when feas@xmath5 forms a nearly ideal tetrahedron , namely , when the bond angle of as - fe - as , @xmath6 , is @xmath7 109.5@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite however , it is still an unresolved puzzle why @xmath2 is so different among different classes . even in @xmath0feaso(f ) , the optimal @xmath2 is 28  k for @xmath0 = la , whereas for @xmath0 = nd , sm , gd , tb , and dy , the maximum @xmath2 is higher than 50  k.  @xcite to understand this difference in @xmath2 , it is desirable to search for its origin in the electronic structure , as well as in the electron dynamics .",
    "recall that in the conventional bcs superconductors , @xmath2 is more or less connected to scattering of the carriers in the normal - state charge transport , since the electron ",
    "phonon interaction is the origin of both the electron pairing that determines @xmath2 and the carrier scattering that determines the resistivity .",
    "@xcite for the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors , the carrier scattering rate is basically proportional to temperature ( @xmath4 ) , and the @xmath4-linear scattering rate is nearly independent of material and doping .",
    "this `` universal '' charge transport is considered to be a hallmark of the high-@xmath2 cuprates . as @xmath2 is strongly material dependent ,",
    "it is not directly correlated with the scattering .    here",
    ", we investigate the transport properties of the oxygen - deficient oxypnictides lafeaso@xmath1 and ndfeaso@xmath1 to explore how the charge transport in the normal state is correlated with the superconducting @xmath2 in this class of pnictides , as well as in other classes of feas - based superconductors for comparison .",
    "recently , single crystals of doped bafe@xmath9as@xmath9 systems have been synthesized , and their transport properties have been investigated .",

    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first systematic study of oxygen - deficient @xmath0feaso@xmath1 , covering a wide range of doping levels and revealing the evolution of the transport coefficients , resistivity , hall coefficient , and magnetoresistance .",
    "since the oxypnictides are known as a multiband system with a fermi surface consisting of three hole and two electron sheets , we have to take this into account in analyzing the transport properties by measuring the temperature and magnetic - field dependences of these transport coefficients . in this paper",
    ", we will show that @xmath2 seems to be correlated with the scattering in the case of fe - based superconductors .",

    "we found no difference in the sample quality between @xmath0 = la and nd .",
    "because some of the starting materials are quite reactive to oxygen , we could not prevent their oxidation in the synthesis procedure .",

    "there was no trace of impurity phases in x - ray diffraction patterns . in order to make the distribution of the oxygen deficiency homogeneous ,",
    "the samples were annealed in air at 450  @xmath8c . the introduction of oxygen deficiency is considered to work as electron doping , which seems equivalent to the substitution of fluorine for oxygen .  @xcite a standard four - terminal method was used for the resistivity measurements . since the anisotropy ratio @xmath11/@xmath12 is estimated to be @xmath725 or larger ,  @xcite it is reasonable to assume that the transport properties of the polycrystalline samples mainly reflect the in - plane ones . from comparison of the transport data of polycrystalline samples and those of single crystals of other fe - pnictide systems , such as ba(fe@xmath13co@xmath14)@xmath9as@xmath9 ,  @xcite , and also from the result for single crystalline prfeaso@xmath1 ,  @xcite , in these dense polycrystalline samples obtained by high - pressure synthesis , the grain boundary contributions to both resistivity and hall coefficient are small , scarcely affecting their @xmath4- and @xmath15-dependences .",

    "this feature is suggestive of the presence of short - range magnetic / structural order which appears to coexist with superconductivity for @xmath10 = 0.08 and 0.10 , and to be a possible source of the large residual resistivity observed for all the compounds with @xmath10 lower than 0.10 .",
    "also , in conjunction with the `` poor '' metallic behavior , the transverse magnetoresistance becomes small over the whole temperature range .",
    "note that @xmath22(@xmath4 ) exhibits a nearly parallel downshift on going from @xmath10 = 0.02 to 0.10 .",
    "this indicates that the dominant effect of doping in this regime is to reduce the residual ( elastic scattering ) component of resistivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) by suppressing the short - range order .",
    "we realize that a rapid decrease of the residual resistivity upon doping into the `` parent '' material is a quite common feature observed in almost all feas - based superconductors so far investigated .",
    "@xcite the hall coefficient in this regime is strongly @xmath4-dependent .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath19 for @xmath10 = 0.08 increases with lowering temperature , just like that for @xmath10 = 0 , possibly due to incomplete fermi surface reconstruction associated with the short - range order .",
    "when @xmath10 exceeds 0.10 , a remarkable reduction in the residual resistivity takes place ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) , probably as a result of disappearance of the short - range order . since the amount of oxygen deficiency increases , the reduction of the residual resistivity is evidence that the disorder due to oxygen deficiency in the lao blocks has a minor effect on carrier scattering . for @xmath10 @xmath33 0.11 , @xmath34 , in the `` optimal '' and `` overdoped '' regimes , @xmath22(@xmath4 ) becomes dominated by a @xmath3 term , indicative of electron  electron scattering",
    ". such @xmath3 dependence up to high temperatures is widely observed in correlated electron systems , in which electron ",
    "electron interaction dominates the scattering of the carriers .",
    "@xcite the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath19 becomes weaker .",
    "thus , the charge transport in this regime appears to show normal ( good ) metallic behavior .    as @xmath10 further increases from 0.11 , the coefficient of the @xmath3 resistivity decreases . in view of the increased magnitude of @xmath19 on going from @xmath10 = 0.11 to 0.23 , it is plausible that a decrease of the scattering rate , rather than the increase of carrier density , is responsible for the observed decrease in @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of mr , a measure of carrier mobility , becomes larger with increasing @xmath10 ( it is 1@xmath32 for @xmath10 = 0.11 and reaches @xmath7 8@xmath32 at @xmath15 = 6",

    "judging from the negative sign of @xmath19 , the nonlinearity of @xmath20 , and the enhanced magnitude of @xmath19 with respect to that for @xmath10 = 0.11 , two types of electrons contributed to @xmath20 ( see appendix ) .",
    "one of the two should have higher mobility and lower density , which would have a major contribution to @xmath19 and be the origin of the large mr .",
