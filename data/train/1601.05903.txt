    "the hydrodynamical simulations of rotating disk play important roles in the field of astrophysical and planetary science , since astronomical objects are formed by the gravitational collapse and the conservation of initially imprinted tiny angular momentum makes rotating disks during the collapsing process , e.g. , galactic disks , accretion disks , protoplanetary disks and post impact debris disks . smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph * ? ? ?",

    "however , it has been long known that sph can not follow the long - term evolution of thin and cold disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are two possible reasons for the decay of the disk .",
    "one is the error in the discretized hydrodynamical force ( pressure gradient ) , which is often referred to as the `` e@xmath2 error '' or `` zero - th order error '' in the sph discretization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite pointed out that the hydrodynamical torque leads to the disruption of the galactic disk embedded in a hot halo .",
    "the other possible reason is the artificial viscosity ( av ) .",
    "av is a numerical dissipation term which is required to capture the shock , first proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since av does not exist in the original governing equations , av should act only on the shock . in sph , there are two well known formulations of av .",
    "one is based on the `` @xmath0 '' term where @xmath3 means velocity , and the other is based on relative velocities of neighbor particles ( see sections [ sec : vnrl_av ] and [ sec : pairwise_av ] for detail ) . in the following , we call the former one `` @xmath0 '' av and the latter one `` pairwise '' av . in almost all recent works ,",
    "the latter `` pairwise '' av has been used .",
    "it has been pointed out that , however , av , in particular the latter formulation , operates not only on the shock , but also on the velocity shears .",
    "this spurious shear viscosity causes unwanted angular momentum transfer in rotating systems . to suppress this effect , several `` switches '' to suppress av in shear flow",
    "have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have compared their implementation of sph with some of these switches and the `` standard '' sph in the context of galaxy formation .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite developed a new scheme , weighted particle hydrodynamics ( wph ) .",
    "unlike sph , wph adopts the riemann solver to deal with the shock , which introduces sufficient viscosity at the shock .",
    "in addition , they argued that wph resolved the zero - th order error.@xcite reported that wph could maintain the thin and cold rotational disk for much longer time than sph can .    despite these efforts ,",
    "the main reason for the rapid disruption of the disk is still unclear . in this paper , to clarify the reason of the disruption of the disk , we compare most of popular formulations of av , their switches and derivative operators .",
    "we performed the systematic survey of all possible combinations of different formulations .",
    "we then investigate the angular momentum transfer due to both av and sph errors .",

    "there is theoretically no mechanism of the angular momentum transfer in the disks .",
    "hence the evolution of the disks is induced by the numerical effect .",
    "these figures clearly describe how the disks break up .",
    "with m97-no - no - sph , at the very first step , a huge av torque works at the inner edge ( see figs . [",
    "fig : m97-no - no - sph ] and [ fig : m97-no - no - sph_bin ] ) .",
    "this torque is negative and thus the inner edge of the disk is decelerated .",
    "consequently , the inner edge start to fall off from the rest of the disk .",

    "finally these isolated rings break up . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m97-no - no - sph_bin ] , we can clearly see that the av torque to the innermost ring is initially very large and remains to be large .",

    "[ fig : m97-b95-r+00-sph ] and [ fig : m97-b95-r+00-sph_bin ] ) .",

    "apparently , the way the disk is disrupted is quite different from that for the case of m97-no - no - sph .",
    "inner region of the disk becomes disordered before the falling down of the innermost ring occurs , and from this disordered ring particles are eventually kicked out , and then complete break down of the inner region takes place .    with vnrl - b95-r+00-g+12 ,",

    "[ fig : vnrl - b95-r+00-g+12_bin ] that the av torque is of the orders of @xmath67 which is five orders of magnitude smaller than that in the case of m97-b95-r+00-sph .",
    "the use of switches and the use of vnrl av instead of the m97 av reduce the av torque drastically , resulting in the extension of the disk lifetime .",

    "the mechanism of the breaking up of the disk seems to be similar to that in m97-b95-r+00-sph .",
    "the particle alignment becomes disordered first , and eventually particles are kicked out from the inner edge of the disk .",
    "however , both the time to become disordered and the time to eject particles are much longer . in figure",
    "[ fig : vnrl - b95-r+00-g+12 ] we can see that disorders of particles start to grow at @xmath69 orbits .",

    "the disorder propagates to the while disk .",
    "note that this azimuthal motion seems to have a mode with a wavenumber @xmath70 .",
    "this comes from the construction of the initial condition ( see appendix [ sec : app2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : inner ] shows the time evolution of the av torque per mass on the particles which are initially on the inner edge .",
    "it is apparent that in the run with m97-no - no - sph particles feel a large torque from the beginning to the end of the simulation .",
    "the torque in the run with m97-b95-r+00-sph is about three orders of magnitude smaller at the beginning , but it increases exponentially after @xmath71 until the break up of the disk .",

    "[ fig : amtransport ] shows the difference between the radial distributions of angular momenta at the initial state at the end time .",

    "it is well known that sph has difficulties when used to simulate the evolution of cold and thin differentially rotating disks .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this difficulty , namely , the error in the pressure gradient and spurious shear viscosity in av .    in this paper , we present the result of a survey of the proposed implementations of av , their switches and derivative operators . for the simulation of cold , keplerian disk , we found that vnrl av gives much better result compared to widely used m97 av .",

    "their results are consistent to our results with the pairwise av .",
    "though the modern switches improve the behavior of the pair - wise av significantly , we found the vnrl formulation behaves systematically better than the pair - wise av .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that the former responds to the compression while the latter responds to approaching pair of particles .",
    "thus , the pair - wise formulation can not discriminate between the compression and shear .",
    "this difference results in the difference between the results of keplerian test .",
