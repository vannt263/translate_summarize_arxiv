    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red ( or brown ) dwarf transferring the gas via roche overflow [ for a general review of cvs , see @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a subclass of cvs that show outbursts .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a class of dne that show long - lasting superoutbursts in addition to short , normal outbursts . during superoutbursts , superhumps , which have a period a few percent longer than the orbital period ,",
    "are observed .",
    "it is widely believed that outbursts in dne are caused by thermal instability of the accretion disk and superoutbursts and superhumps are caused by tidal instability arising from the 3:1 resonance in the accretion disk with the orbiting secondary [ thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ] .",
    "quite recently , this picture has become even more firmly established by analyses of kepler observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the tti model does not explicitly consider the effect of magnetism of the white dwarf , some cvs have magnetic fields of the white dwarf strong enough to affect the dynamics in the accretion disk . if the magnetic field is strong enough , the accretion disk can not form and the transferred matter directly accretes on the magnetic poles of the white dwarf .",
    "this condition is usually met in polars ( am her - type objects ) in which the strong magnetic field synchronizes the rotation of the white dwarf with the orbital period . in systems with weaker magnetic fields , disks can form but are truncated by the magnetic field in its inner part .",
    "this condition is usually met in intermediate polars ( ips ) in which the white dwarf rotates asynchronously with the orbital period [ for a review of ips , see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "several dne have been confirmed to be ips ; especially notable are gk per @xcite and do dra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are both objects above the period gap and are not expected to develop tidal instability . in recent years , several dne below the period gap have been identified or proposed to be ips , including cc scl , the subject of this paper .",
    "the inner disk is supposed to be truncated in such systems , and it may affect the global dynamics of the disk in outburst . such a system is expected to provide us insight into the effect of magnetism in development of outbursts and superoutbursts , and may eventually help us better understanding the mechanism of outbursts and superhumps .",
    "cc scl was discovered as a rosat source ( rx j2315.5@xmath23049 ) and was optically identified as a dwarf nova , although outbursts had not been detected @xcite .",
    "r. stubbings visually detected two outbursts in 2000 ( vsnet - outburst 245 , 810 ) . during the second outburst",
    ", @xcite detected likely superhumps with a period of 0.078  d and amplitudes of @xmath30.3 mag .",

    "( 2000 , vsnet - campaign 544 ) .",
    "@xcite interpreted that this discrepancy may be understood if the object is an ip .",

    ", @xcite detected superhumps with a mean period of 0.0600  d. @xcite , using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , demonstrated that the irregular profiles seen in the superhumps in this systems are caused by the superposition of superhumps and orbital modulations .",

    "such shortening of the superhump period immediately following the rapid decline apparently is unique to cc scl .",

    "this dynamical precession rate is considered to be equal to the observed @xmath25 when the pressure effect can be ignored .",

    "we can express fractional superhump excesses ( in frequency unit ) of post - superoutburst superhumps as follows : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fractional superhump excess and disk radius immediately after the outburst , respectively .    in various su uma - type objects other than wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings ,",

    "this value is within a range of @xmath29 in @xcite , who assumed the mass - radius relation for a normal lower main - sequence secondary .    by assuming @xmath0=0.072",

    "we assumed flat and axisymmetric geometry and a standard disk having a surface luminosity with a radial dependence @xmath31 ( i.e. assuming that we observed the rayleigh - jeans tail of the emission from the hot disk ) .",
    "the secondary is assumed to fill the roche lobe .",
    "although these assumptions on the disk are rough , they will not seriously affect the results . in the present case , this is because the central part of this disk needs to be grazingly eclipsed to reproduce the shallow eclipse in outburst , and the result is very insensitive to the condition in the outer part of the disk ( either radius or the existence of disk flaring ) .",
    "for an optically thick disk with a broad range of radius 0.330.46@xmath16 , an inclination value of @xmath32= best reproduced the observed eclipse depth of 0.11 mag ( figure [ fig : ccscloutporb ] , in which the case of 0.41@xmath16 is shown as an example ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath32 was less than .    the depth of eclipses is deeper in quiescence .",
    "this is likely caused by the contribution from the hot spot .",

    "the 2011 observation yielded a period of 0.0045076(2 )  d ( amplitude 0.09 mag ) and the 2014 one yielded 0.0045079(9 )  d ( amplitude 0.08 mag ) .",

    "spin modulations in post - superoutburst stage were not clearly detected in lasso analysis since short ( 2.5  d ) windows were used .",

    "we can thus expect to see superoutbursts if the total angular momentum accumulates during the cycles of normal outbursts and the disk radius eventually reaches the 3:1 resonance on the occasion of an outburst .",
