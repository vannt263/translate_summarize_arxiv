    "the detailed understanding of the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or density has become an issue of great interest in recent years . unfortunately , even if a significant progress has been made on the development of ab initio calculations such as lattice qcd , these are not yet able to provide a full understanding of the qcd phase diagram and the related hadron properties , due to the well - known difficulties of dealing with small current quark masses and finite chemical potentials .",
    "thus it is important to develop effective models that show consistency with lattice results and can be extrapolated into regions not accessible by lattice calculation techniques .",
    "recently , models in which quark fields interact via local four point vertices and where the polyakov loop is introduced to account for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition ( so - called polyakov - nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) models @xcite ) have received considerable attention . here , we consider a non - local extension of these pnjl models , which includes terms leading to the quark wave function renormalization .",
    "two different parameterizations are used : an exponential form , and a parametrization based on a fit to the mass and renormalization function obtained in lattice calculations . in the context of this type of model the properties of the vacuum and meson sectors at @xmath0 have been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "this contribution is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the model lagrangian and its parameterizations . in sec .",
    "3 we present and discuss our results for the behavior of some thermodynamical properties and the corresponding phase diagrams . finally , in sec .",
    "4 our main conclusions are summarized .",
    "we consider here a nonlocal su(2 ) chiral quark model which includes quark couplings to the color gauge fields .",
    "the corresponding euclidean effective action is given by @xmath1 \\psi(x ) \\ ! - \\ !",

    "the fermion kinetic term includes a covariant derivative @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are color gauge fields .",
    "the nonlocal currents @xmath9 are given by @xmath10    here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq.([currents ] ) , are nonlocal covariant form factors characterizing the corresponding interactions .",
    "the scalar - isoscalar component of the @xmath15 current will generate the momentum dependent quark mass in the quark propagator , while the `` momentum '' current , @xmath16 will be responsible for a momentum dependent wave function renormalization of this propagator .    to proceed",
    "it is convenient to perform a standard bosonization of the theory .",
    "thus , we introduce the bosonic fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and integrate out the quark fields . in",
    "what follows , we work within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , in which these bosonic fields are replaced by their vacuum expectation values @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "next , we extend the so obtained bosonized effective mfa action to finite temperature @xmath21 and chemical potential @xmath22 using the matsubara formalism .",
    "concerning the gluon fields we will assume that they provide a constant background color field @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the su(3 ) color gauge fields .",
    "then the traced polyakov loop , which is taken as order parameter of confinement , is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we will work in the so - called polyakov gauge , in which the matrix @xmath28 is given a diagonal representation @xmath29 , which leaves only two independent variables , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "owing to the charge conjugation properties of the qcd lagrangian  @xcite , the mean field value of the polyakov loop field @xmath32 is expected to be a real quantity .",
    "in addition , we assume as usual that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are real - valued fields  @xcite , this implies that @xmath33 , then @xmath34/3 $ ] .    within this framework the mean field thermodynamical potential @xmath35 results @xmath36 + \\frac{\\bar \\sigma_1 ^ 2}{2\\,g_s } + \\frac{\\kappa_p^2\\ \\bar \\sigma_2 ^ 2}{2\\,g_s } + { \\cal{u}}(\\bar \\phi , t ) \\ , \\label{granp_reg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the shorthand notation @xmath37 has been used , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 \\qquad , \\qquad z(p )   =   \\left [ 1 - \\bar{\\sigma}_{2 } \\",

    "namely , @xmath46 with @xmath47 for @xmath48 respectively . at this stage",
    "we need to specify the explicit form of the polyakov loop effective potential . here , we used the fit to qcd lattice results proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath35 turns out to be divergent and , thus , needs to be regularized . for this purpose",
    "we use the same prescription as in ref .",
    "namely @xmath49 where @xmath50 is obtained from the first term in eq.([granp_reg ] ) by setting @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the regularized expression for the quark thermodynamical potential in the absence of fermion interactions , @xmath53 \\ , \\label{freeomegareg}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 .",
    "finally , note that in eq.([omegareg ] ) we have included a constant @xmath55 which is fixed by the condition that @xmath56 vanishes at @xmath0 .",
    "the mean field values @xmath57 and @xmath58 at a given temperature or chemical potential , are obtained from a set of three coupled `` gap '' equations .",
    "this set of equations follows from the minimization of the regularized thermodynamical potential , that is @xmath59 once the mean field values are obtained , the @xmath60 behavior of other relevant quantities can be determined .    in order to fully specify the model under consideration we have to fix the model parameters as well as the form factors @xmath61 and @xmath62 which characterize the non - local interactions .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we consider two different type of functional dependencies for these form factors .",
    "the first one corresponds to the often used exponential forms , @xmath63 \\qquad , \\qquad f(q)= \\mbox{exp}[-q^{2}/\\lambda_{1}^{2 } ] \\ . \\label{regulators}\\ ] ] note that the range ( in momentum space ) of the nonlocality in each channel is determined by the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "fixing the @xmath0 values of @xmath66 and chiral quark condensate to reasonable values",
    "@xmath67 mev and @xmath68 mev the rest of the parameters are determined so as to reproduce the empirical values @xmath69 mev and @xmath70 mev , and @xmath71 which is within the range of values suggested by recent lattice calculations@xcite . in what follows this choice of model parameters and form factors will be referred as parametrization s1 .",
    "the second type of form factor functional forms we consider is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73^{-1 } \\qquad ; \\qquad f_{z}(q ) = \\left [ 1 + \\left ( q^{2}/\\lambda_{1}^{2}\\right ) \\right]^{-5/2 } \\ . \\label{parametrization_set2}\\ ] ] as shown in ref.@xcite , with a convenient choice of parameters one can very well reproduce the momentum dependence of mass and the renormalization function obtained in a landau gauge lattice calculation as well as the physical values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in what follows this parametrization",
    "will be referred as s2 .",
    "finally , in order to compare with previous studies where the wavefunction renormalization of the quark propagator has been ignored we consider a third parametrization ( s3 ) . in such case",
    "we take @xmath39 = 1 ( setting @xmath42 = 0 ) and exponential parametrization for @xmath41 .",
    "the values of the model parameters for each of the chosen parameterizations are summarized in table i.    [ c]ccccc & & s1 & s2 & s3 + @xmath76 & mev & 5.70 & 2.37 & 5.78 + @xmath77 & & 32.030 & 20.818 & 20.650 + @xmath78 & mev & 814.42 & 850.00 & 752.20 + @xmath79 & gev & 4.180 & 6.034 &",

    "we start by analyzing the behavior of some mean field quantities as functions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . since the results obtained for our three different parameterizations are qualitatively quite similar we only present explicitly those corresponding to the parametrization s1 .    ,",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 as functions of @xmath21 for low ( left ) , high ( right ) and cep ( central ) chemical potentials .",
    "note that the scale to the left corresponds to that of @xmath84 while that to the right to @xmath82 and @xmath32 . since @xmath82 turns out to be negative we plot @xmath85 . ]",
    "they are given in fig.1 where we plot @xmath86 , @xmath82 and @xmath32 as functions of @xmath21 for some values of the chemical potential .",
    "1a shows that at @xmath87 there is a certain value of @xmath21 at which @xmath84 drops rapidly signalling the existence of a chiral symmetry restoration crossover transition , its position being determined by the peak of the chiral susceptibility . at basically the same temperature the polyakov loop @xmath32 increases which can be interpreted as the onset of the deconfinement transition .",
    "as @xmath22 increases there is a certain value of @xmath88 above which the transition starts to be discontinuous . at this precise chemical potential",
    "the transition is of second order .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig.1b .",
    "the corresponding values @xmath89 define the position of the so - called `` critical end point '' . as displays in fig.1c , for @xmath90 the transition becomes discontinuous , i.e. of first order . finally , for chemical potentials above @xmath91 mev the system is in the chirally restored phase for all values of the temperature .",
    "it is important to note that although @xmath82 appears to be rather constant in fig.1 , at higher values of @xmath21 it does go to zero as expected . concerning the deconfinement transition we see that as @xmath22 increases there appears a region where system remains in its confined phase ( signalled by @xmath32 smaller than @xmath92 ) even though chiral symmetry has been restored .",
    "this corresponds to the recently proposed quarkyonic phase@xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams corresponding to our three different parameterizations are given in fig.[phase diagrams ] . here",
    "the dotted line corresponds to the line of crossover chiral transition while the full line to the line of first order chiral transition .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the deconfinement transition ( the lower and upper lines correspond to @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively ) . comparing those of s1 and s3 we see that the main effect of the wave function renormalization term is to shift the location of the cep towards lower values of @xmath21 and higher values @xmath22 .",
    "concerning the lattice adjusted parametrization s2 we observe that it leads to even lower values of @xmath95 and higher values @xmath96 .     and @xmath97 , respectively ) .",
    "a non - local extension of the pnjl model momentum which leads to momentum dependent quark mass and wave function renormalization has been studied .",
    "this model provides a simultaneous description for the deconfinement and chiral phase transition .",
    "non - local interactions have been described by considering both a set of exponential form factors , and a set of form factors obtained from a fit to the mass and renormalization functions obtained in lattice calculations .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams turn out to be qualitative similar , the position of the critical end point being the feature which depends more crucially on each particular parametrization .",
