    "[ rulkov](b ) , has a local maximum happening in a time @xmath6 .",
    "the duration of the burst , @xmath34 , depends on the variable @xmath1 and fluctuates in an irregular behaviour as long as @xmath1 undergoes irregular evolution .",
    "then , we define a phase describing the time evolution within each burst , varying from 0 to @xmath35 as @xmath36 evolves from @xmath6 to @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an integer .",
    "we use the kuramoto s order parameter as a diagnostic of the burst phase synchronisation , that is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the amplitude and @xmath42 is the angle of a centroid phase vector for an one - dimensional network with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "we are interested in studying the role of the electrical and chemical coupling strength at the level of bursting synchronisation .",
    "for this reason , we use the time averaged order parameter magnitude , given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the time interval , as a measure of synchronisation in the network .",
    "if the bursting dynamics in the area @xmath51 is globally synchronised , we obtain @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ areas ] shows the time averaged order parameter in colour scale as a function of the electrical and chemical coupling strength . due to the fact that the neurons are not identical the neuronal network does not present a completely phase synchronised state ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "all the cognitive areas , except for the auditory , present strong synchronisation ( white region ) .        the auditory region does not present high levels of bursting synchronisation .",
    "this effect is due to the complex network topology , where the synchronisation patterns are controlled by input intensities among neurons , and also among the corticocortical areas @xcite . to show that we define the mean field of the auditory area @xmath60 and the mean field of the @xmath61 inputs coming from other areas @xmath62 where @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 represents the number of non null elements in the matrix @xmath24 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that each neuron @xmath66 belonging to a set @xmath67 in the auditory area is connected to a neuron @xmath68 in a set @xmath43 belonging to another cognitive area . due to spatial distance between areas",

    "the irregular time evolution , that it is associated with a non synchronised behaviour , is influenced by the stimuli from the visual ( fig .",

    "[ fig4]c ) , and the frontolimbic ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]d ) areas .",
    "this figure shows that the collective behaviour of the auditory area is correlated with the input from the frontolimbic .",
    "if the auditory area is isolated from other areas , by making @xmath75 it will present global bursting synchronisation with a frequency around 0.0027 .",
    "the frequency is obtained from bursts .",
    "connecting the auditory area with the rest causes a suppression of bursting synchronisation , as well as the appearance of one more frequency with value equal to 0.0025 ( fig . [",
    "we can see through figure [ fig5](b ) that the new frequency appears by a resonant effect caused by the oscillations of the stimulus from others areas .",
    "the visual and somato - motor areas present the frequency equal to 0.0025 with magnitude equal to 0.0005 and 0.001 , respectively .",
    "the frontolimbic area also exhibits this value of frequency , but the magnitude is larger than visual and somato - motor areas .",
    "therefore , the low levels of synchrony in the auditory area is mainly due to the new frequency of the input from frontolimbic area .     and @xmath69.,width=377,height=302 ]",
    "it has been experimentally found that the incidence of light with a suitably chosen frequency on a group of neurons is able to alter their spiking activity .",
    "this phenomenon was verified by boyden and collaborators @xcite , by means of blue light they activated spikes in neurons genetically modified , and also suppressed spikes through yellow light . with this in mind , we consider an external perturbation ( @xmath22 ) acting on 100 neurons randomly chosen in the same cognitive area .",
    "this perturbation , aiming to simulate blue light optical stimulus , has excitatory effect on the perturbed neurons making them spike independent of their previous state .",
    "we apply an external perturbation on the visual area to verify the synchronisation behaviour .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the effects of this perturbation in the cognitive areas .",
    "synchronisation is fully suppressed in the visual area .",
    "the somatosensory - motor and frontolimbic areas do not present significant alterations due to the perturbation in the visual area .",
    "this behaviour is due to the small number of connections between these areas and the visual area . on the other hand ,",
    "the auditory area exhibits a change in its synchronous behaviour . without an external perturbation the auditory area does not present high levels of synchronisation , shown in figure [ areas ] , but with the perturbation in the visual area it is possible to observe strong synchronisation domains in the auditory area .    in order to understand the perturbation effect in the auditory area",
    "we calculate the time evolution of the mean field @xmath70 , and the mean field from inputs coming from others areas @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 into the area @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig7](a ) shows that the mean field of the auditory area has a regular behaviour , whereas with no external perturbation the behaviour is irregular . comparing the results of figure [ fig7 ] for the external inputs of the mean field on auditory from visual ( b ) , somatosensory - motor ( c ) , and frontolimbic ( d ) with the results of figure [ fig4 ] we can see that the inputs from the visual area becomes frequency - locked with the mean field @xmath70 of the auditory area . @xmath70 and @xmath71 present both the same frequency , approximately @xmath76 , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .     and",
    "@xmath69.,width=377,height=302 ]        perturbations applied in auditory area do not alter significantly the synchronous behaviour of the other areas .",
    "moreover , we have verified which perturbations in the somatosensory - motor and frontolimbic areas produce the same effect on the network such as when they are applied in the visual area .",
    "in this paper we studied burst phase synchronisation in a neuronal network with a topology according to the corticocortical connections of the cat cerebral cortex .",
    "when no perturbation is applied we verified that only the auditory area does not present synchronisation in the parameter space .",
    "this happens because of the large influence of the other areas .",
    "the ratio between inter connections and intra connections is less for the auditory area than other areas . as the consequence the frontolimbic area induces a frequency in the auditory area which helps to suppress burst phase synchronisation .",
    "we verified the suppression of burst phase synchronisation when a stimulus is applied on a cognitive area .",
    "however , the suppression in a specific area can affect another area .",
    "our results have showed that an external perturbation applied into the visual area suppresses synchronisation in the visual area , but surprisingly it induces synchronisation in the auditory area .",
    "the same happens for perturbation applied in the somatosensory - motor and frontolimbic which induces synchronisation in the auditory area .",
