    "( high energy stereoscopic system ) performed a survey of the inner part of the galaxy where its excellent capability provided a breakthrough in the field of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) study : for the first time the morphological structure of many middle - age pwne were resolved in the @xmath0-ray band . a detailed spectral and morphological analysis of the archetypal example of this population , psr@xmath1b1823 - 13 and its associated tev nebula hess@xmath1j1825 - 137 revealed for the first time in @xmath0-rays a steepening of the energy spectrum with increasing distance from the pulsar , probably due to the synchrotron radiative cooling of the inverse - compton ( ic ) @xmath0-ray emitting electrons during their propagation ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006b ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the different sizes observed in x - rays and very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays can be explained by the different cooling timescales for the radiating electron populations ( de jager et al .",
    "however , the question of the unusual large size of this pwn candidate compared to what the dynamical simulations predict still remains ( de jager et al .",
    "2005 ; de jager @xmath9 djannati 2008 ) and is difficult to solve . the confusion is even aggravated because of the non - detection of the associated supernova shell , like it is the case for most of the other middle - aged tev pwn candidates ( gallant et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "hess@xmath1j1640 - 465 is one of the sources discovered by hess during this galactic survey in 2004 - 2006 ( aharonian et al .",
    "this source is marginally extended with profile close to a gaussian shape .",
    "the spectrum is well fitted by a simple power - law with an index of @xmath10 2.4 and a total integrated flux above 200 gev of @xmath11 . as it is shown in figure 1 ,",
    "the source is spatially coincident with the snr g338.3 - 0.0 , known from radio observations as a @xmath12 diameter broken shell with a 7 jy flux at 1ghz ( whiteoak @xmath9 green 1996 ) .",
    "a radio bridge extending to the north of the system is visible in the most data and coincident with the bright h@xmath1ii region g338.4 + 0.0 ( whiteoak @xmath9 green 1996 ) , possibly connected to the shell .",
    "the fact that the tev source is center filled and does nt match the shell has favoured the hypothesis that the emission is produced by a pwn so far .",
    "this field has been successively observed by asca ( sugizaki et al .",
    "2001 ) and the swift x - ray telescope ( landi et al .",
    "2006 ) ; both detected a highly absorbed source inside the shell , with compatible positions and non thermal spectra .",
    "+ in 2006 , a dedicated xmm - newton observation of the field of view revealed an extended x - ray object at the position ( @xmath13 , @xmath14(j2000))(funk et al .",
    "this extended source ( xmmuj164045.4 - 463131 ) exhibits a strongly absorbed spectrum with a potential non - thermal spectrum ( index @xmath15 ) centered about the vhe source position .",
    "however , because of the low number of counts of these observations the spectrum was poorly constrained , and the insufficient angular resolution was not able to resolve any compact nebula , nor a pulsar which could confirm the hypothesis of a pwn emission .",
    "we report here on the first chandra observation of this field .",
    "we present a detailed data analysis and discuss the physical implications of this first case of a complete middle - age composite system with vhe pwn emission .",
    "we report here on x - ray observation of the field around the position of hess@xmath1j1640 - 465 taken in may 2007 ( obs id:7591 ) using the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "data were collected with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in timed exposure , very faint mode , providing a temporal resolution of 3.2 s. the target was imaged on i3 chip , with the asca source position @xmath16 from the optical axis .",
    "the other acis chips activated during this observation were s2 , s3 , i0 , i1 , i2 .",
    "this imaging system offers an on - axis spatial resolution of 0.8 arcsec . +",
    "a total of 30 ks of live - time was accumulated . after removing small intervals in",
    "which data were not recorded , the final exposure time for this observation was 26.4 ks .",
    "after standard processing had been carried out at the chandra science center , we analyzed the resultant events list using the ciao(v3.4 ) , ftools(v6.0.4 ) , caldb(v3.3 ) , and xspec(v12.2.1 ) x - ray analysis software packages .",
    "figure 2 shows an exposure - corrected and smoothed image ( using a gaussian with @xmath17 ) in the 2 - 10 kev energy range , encompassing the central part of the field of view of the acis - i array . to produce this figure , we divided the map of raw counts by the exposure map and normalized by the exposure time in order to produce an image in units of @xmath18 .",
    "the morphology of the x - ray emission imaged here is consistent with the one seen by xmm at lower spatial resolution : we confirm the presence of a diffuse nebula seen extending @xmath19 around the position of xmmuj164045.4 - 463131 ( funk et al .",
    "but at the higher spatial resolution of the chandra data , some new morphological features become apparent , in particular the two compact sources s1 and s2 ( see figure 2 and table 1 ) : s1 is coincident with the brighter part of the diffuse emission ( north - east ) and the other ( s2 ) is placed on the edge , on the north - west side of the nebula .",
    "+ figure 3 shows the radial profile along arcs centered on the bright point - source ( s1 ) position along the ne - sw direction .",
    "the surface brightness profile is presented in unit of @xmath20 .",
    "all the point sources of the field have been subtracted except s1 .",
    "the dashed line represents chandra s psf at an energy of 2.5 kev , shown at the position of s1 .",
    "it has been obtained by simulating a psf map using caldbv3.3 and the mkpsf tool and superimposing it on the average background level derived from the dashed circular background regions shown in figure 2 , then projecting it on the radial profile .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the extent of the source s1 is consistent with the point - spread function of the telescope .",
    "we can see the compact nebula component lying asymmetrically from -20 to + 70. the inner core of the emission is consistent with a point source surrounded by extended structures lying mainly in the south - west direction .",
    "the fact that this diffuse component steadily fades with increasing distance from s1 supports the interpretation in which it is the central source of energy of this emission .",
    "+ the brightest inner pwn component ( called hereafter comp pwn ) , is @xmath21 in area .",
    "figure 2 shows in addition marginal evidence of a tail , apparently emanating from s1 .",
    "it lies within a @xmath22 area size to the sw of s1 , with a major axis along the se - nw line ( called extended pwn thereafter ) .",
    "we can note that this faint emission has surprisingly a different elongation axis from that associated with the inner core of the nebula .",
    "+    .corrected coordinates of s1 and s2 point sources . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + the high spin - down power used to derive the upper energy of the injected electron spectrum is needed to reproduce the flux and index in the x - ray band .",
    "using a smaller @xmath23 would decrease the electron upper limit energy which would have the effect of a prematured cut - off in the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the minimum energy value is strongly constrained by the flux level given the age and power evolution of the pulsar .",
    "its fit value looks reasonable given the known properties of the pulsar wind , and it constrains the radio emission to a low flux which is in agreement with the non - detection of any radio nebula in the field .",
    "the magnetic field found is typical of such middle - age vela like objects , the decreasing index corresponds to a field which varies from an initial value of 35 @xmath24 g to an actual value of 6 @xmath24 g ( 15 kyr later ) .",
    "the shape of magnetic field evolution can affect the spectrum index , but the low degree of details in vhe resolution of the source ( because of hess s poor psf ) , make such a precise shape analysis non pertinent in this paper .",
    "finally , the vhe flux can be reached using the cmbr alone , but in order to reproduce the spectral index , we need the addition of the dust and visible target components . + given the reasonable values of parameters needed to reproduce the chandra and hess spectra and their relatively good compatibility with the known characteristics of the middle - aged vela - like pulsars and pwne , the interpretation of the x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emission as originating from a pulsar - driven nebula appears secure .",
    "this high - resolution chandra acis observation of hess@xmath1j1640 - 165 inside the shell g338.3 - 0.0 , has allowed us to spatially resolve a pwn and its putative pulsar , and perform a spectral analysis .",
    "we found that the spectra are both highly absorbed and non - thermal , and the indices and luminosities resemble those of typical vela - like pulsar systems . using h@xmath1i absorption features",
    ", we were able to constrain the distance of the shell between 8.5 and 13 kpc , this distance range being compatible with the large @xmath2 value derived from x - ray spectral analysis , we concluded that it is likely associated with the shell g338.3 - 0.0 .",
    "we finally discussed a scenario in which the @xmath0-rays originate from the ic scattering and x - ray from the synchrotron emission of the electron populations in the nebula , and show that the vhe source hess@xmath1j1640 - 165 is likely a pwn , probably associated with a vela - like pulsar of @xmath25 .",
    "if this interpretation is true , this object is a nice example of a middle - aged composite system where the total pwn extension ( traced by the tev emission ) fills almost 75 percent of the associated snr shell area , which is quite surprising given that dynamical simulations currently predict a 25 percent .",
    "future search for similar cases will be useful in order to confirm or not the generality of this phenomenon and study its causes in detail . in this context",
    ", the detection of the associated pulsars will be very helpful .",
    "a next step of this study could be the high resolution radio imaging of the source and the search for pulsed emission originating from this putative pulsar position .",
