    "between the present prelude and a concluding postlude , the body of this paper is divided into five numbered sections .    for motivation and introduction , section 1 contains a discussion of recent experiments in solid state physics , constructing a single bit ( 0/1 memory register ) of a new kind of computer called the quantum computer .    in section 2",
    "we give the mathematical model behind quantum computation , quantum communication , quantum statistics , quantum probability , quantum stochastics ; the whole field now being called _ quantum information theory_. we will see that the model is ( mathematically speaking ) elementary , it is essentially probabilistic , and it leads to natural statistical problems .",
    "the model is built on precisely four ingredients : notions of ( i ) _ state _ of a quantum system , ( ii ) its time _ evolution _ , ( iii ) the formation of joint systems from separate , called _ entanglement _ , and finally , ( iv ) , the stochastic interface with the real world : _",
    "measurement_. in section 2 we restrict attention to basic forms of these notions : states are actually so - called pure states , ( represented by vectors ) ; evolutions are unitary ; measurements are so - called simple measurements ( projector - valued probability measures ) .",
    "later we will see how combining these building blocks in various ways leads to generalized notions of state , evolution and measurement .",
    "but the four ingredients in their basic form remain the only items on which the whole theory is built .    in section 3 , an intermission",
    ", we will illustrate the basic model ingredients with the example of quantum teleportation , which in a few lines of elementary algebra and a simple probability calculation exemplifies all the key model ingredients , the statistical challenges , and the extraordinary physical implications , of the theory .    in section 4",
    "we take a new look at the model ingredients , extending the notions of pure states and simple measurements to mixed states ( density matrices ) and generalized measurements ( operator - valued probability measures ; more generally , completely positive instruments ) .",
    "this enables us to describe the problems of quantum statistical design and quantum statistical inference in a compact and precise way , and it also gives hope that these problems might have elegant solutions .",
    "in section 5 we develop some theory of quantum statistical inference .",
    "for a quantum statistical model , we define the quantum score and the quantum fisher information , leading to quantum cramr - rao and information bounds ( by now , very classical material ) .",
    "we briefly survey some recent progress in quantum statistical design and inference , in particular the quantum information bound of @xcite and their results on asymptotically optimal quantum design and inference .",
    "this gives solutions to problems posed by the motivating example of section 1 : how can the experimentalists substantiate their claims , with a minimum of experimental effort ?    in a postlude or maybe more appropriately , aftermath",
    ", we will switch to a more polemical mode and comment on the relations between quantum probability , quantum statistics , quantum physics and technology , and real probability and real statistics .",
    "the aim is to convince the reader that the area of quantum statistical inference is grounded in a simple mathematical model , which combines basic elements from probability , statistics , linear algebra , and ( the absolutely basic ) elements of complex analysis .",
    "a bit of trigonometry also comes in handy .",
    "no physics knowledge at all , is needed .",
    "most statisticians training includes all of these ingredients .",
    "however many will not have been exposed to what comes out of the `` intersections '' between these fields , for instance , linear algebra with vectors and matrices of complex numbers instead of real numbers .",
    "but one just needs to learn a few useful facts about eigenvalues and eigenvectors of complex matrices , which directly generalize the familiar facts about symmetric real matrices to _ self - adjoint _ complex matrices , and generalize real orthonormal matrices to complex _ unitary _ matrices .",
    "one does not need any physics background to appreciate the basic modelling , and from there , to contribute to the scientific development of quantum information theory .",
    "the field is associated with some of the most significant current developments in physics , of deep scientific importance and holding promise of substantial technological impact .",
    "the physics we are talking about has an essential probabilistic component ; the experiments which are being done now and the experiments which will play a role in developing the new technologies , are going to need statistical design and analysis . starting from the basic model , one can quickly pose intriguing problems of statistical design and inference , some of which have elegant and exciting solutions , others are quite open .",
    "these toy problems are related to current work in physics , information theory , and computer science , at this moment of great theoretical interest , and likely to become of practical interest in the near future .",
    "already , people working in computer science and in information theory have turned in a big way to ( theoretical ) quantum computation and quantum information theory .",
    "for instance , in korea i refer to the work of dong pyo chi and his colleagues at seoul national university .",
    "strangely , probabilists and statisticians do not seem to be making a similar move .",
    "we will give some thoughts on why this should be so , in the postlude .",
    "the survey papers @xcite and @xcite cover many further topics , especially drawing attention to open problems , and moreover give further references , especially for background reading .",
    "we briefly discuss an experiment carried out in delft , the netherlands , by the group of prof .",
    "hans mooij .",
    "see http://vortex.tn.tudelft.nl/ , and especially the pictures on the personal pages of ph.d student caspar van der wal . the experiment was reported in _ science _ in 1999 .",
    "switching on a magnetic field causes electric current to flow around a superconducting aluminium ring .",
    "the aluminium ring is a thousandth of a millimeter in diameter , and a billion electrons are involved in the current flow . from a classical physical viewpoint",
    "one can imagine just two kinds of current flow of a given size in this little circuit : _ clockwise _ , @xmath0 , and _ anti - clockwise _ , @xmath1 .",
    "the claim of the experimenters was that they produced an electric current in the state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two complex numbers , with @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for two orthogonal unit vectors in a complex vector space , we can think of them as two - dimensional complex column vectors of length @xmath8 , say the basis vectors , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this object has been called _ the delft qubit _ ; a qubit being a single bit in the memory of a future quantum computer . a classical computer works with a memory , the bits of which can register only @xmath11 or @xmath8 , however a quantum computer allows coherent superpositions of @xmath11 and @xmath8 , such as the state i have just talked about .",
    "another description is _ the schrdinger squid _ ; this name refers to the device : a superconducting quantum interference device ; and to the infamous schrdinger cat .",
    "now one might ask , how could the experimenters know that this state has been produced ?",
    "well , by repeating the experiment about ten thousand times , and each time measuring the current .",
    "this is done by a second squid surrounding the first , and connected to the outside world by a lot of circuitry .",
    "it does not directly give us estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , in first instance , it does nothing interesting at all : the measurement essentially looks to see whether the current is flowing @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "this forces the quantum state to jump into either of the states @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and it makes this choice with probabilities @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the experimentalists find the same values of these probabilities ( relative frequencies ) , as are predicted by an elaborate theoretical physical calculation concerning the whole system .",
    "so this does not _ prove _ anything at all : one would have seen the same relative frequencies , if the qubit had from the start been , in a fraction @xmath12 of the times , in state @xmath6 , and in a fraction @xmath13 of the times , in state @xmath7 .",
    "however , small developments in the technology of this experiment will make the finding more secure .",
    "the aim is not just to create qubits but to manipulate them . in particular",
    ", it should be possible to implement the transformation of the state , which sends the original orthonormal basis vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , into the new orthonormal basis vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the result of this _ unitary transformation _ is to convert the original qubit into the state @xmath16 .",
    "if we now measure , we will find relative frequencies of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , different from the relative frequencies had the state been initially in a fraction @xmath12 of the times , @xmath19 , and in a fraction @xmath13 of the times , @xmath20 .",
    "( as the reader may compute , one would then have observed @xmath21 in equal proportions ) .    still , the experiment is difficult to do .",
    "the question considered in this paper is : what is the optimal experimental design in order to determine the actually created state of this quantum qubit as accurately as possible with as small as possible number of repetitions of the experiment ?",
    "the answer to this question was still completely unknown two years ago ; in fact , the correct answer turns out to be quite opposite to many physicists intuition as to what is best .",
    "but the question needs also to be further specified , since what is best depends on what experimental resources are available , what prior knowledge there is about the state being measured , and the relative importance of different features of the state .",
    "building a quantum qubit is just a first step towards building a quantum computer .",
    "though many technologies are being explored for this purpose ( ion traps , nuclear magnetic resonance , optics ) the delft implementation has the promise of scalability : the possibility to control not one or two but thousands of qubits .",
    "the idea of quantum computation is to store program and data of some algorithm , coded in @xmath11 s and @xmath8 s , into the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 of a number of qubits .",
    "the whole system then evolves unitarily , and at the end of this evolution , a series of ( possibly random ) @xmath11 s and @xmath8 s are read off by measuring each qubit separately .",
    "the possibilities allowed by the basic model of quantum mechanics allow , for instance , ( with an algorithm of peter shor ) to factor large integers in polynomial time , which will make all currently used cryptography methods obsolete !",
    "fortunately quantum cryptography promises a secure alternative .",
    "one can not look at a qubit without disturbing it , and if this idea is cleverly exploited , it becomes possible to transmit messages coded in qubit states in such a way , that the interference of any eavesdropper would be detected by the recipient .",
    "quantum computation may still be far away , and moreover it is not entirely clear if it would live up to its promises .",
    "but there is a strong feeling that quantum optical communication technology is just around the corner . in any case , as integrated circuits become smaller and communication speeds faster , present - day technology is rapidly approaching quantum limits . on the other hand",
    ", new quantum technologies can exploit precisely those phenomena that for the older technologies is a barrier to further progress .",
    "what is the basic mathematical model behind all this , what then are the statistical problems , and what do we know about the solutions ?",
    "we have seen the notion of _ states _ ( more precisely , pure state ) , mathematically formalized as vectors @xmath24 in a complex vector space , of unit length : @xmath25 .",
    "states can be _ unitarily transformed _",
    ", that is to say , one may implement an orthonormal transformation ( change of basis ) and get a new state . in principle , any desired unitary transformation could be implemented by setting up appropriate external fields .",
    "it is a manipulation of the state of the quantum system , involving , for instance , magnetic fields , which one can control , but without back - action on the real world outside .",
    "no information passes from the quantum system into the real world .",
    "what we have not yet described is the mathematical model for bringing initially separate quantum systems into ( potential ) interaction with one another .",
    "this is the essential ingredient of the quantum computer : one should not have @xmath26 separate qubits , but one quantum system of @xmath26 qubits together .",
    "the appropriate model for this is the _ formation of tensor products_. in words , two separate systems brought together have as state , a vector in a space of dimension equal to the product of the two original dimensions ; and the new state vector has as components , all the products of two components , one from each of the two original state vectors .",
    "the @xmath26 qubits of a quantum computer live in a @xmath27 dimensional state space .",
    "the initial state is a product state , but a unitary evolution can bring the joint system into a state , which can not be represented as a product state .",
    "this phenomenon is called entanglement .",
    "the last ingredient has already been touched upon , and that is _",
    "measurement_. at this stage , and only at this stage , is information passed from the quantum system into the real world .",
    "the information is random , and its probability distribution depends on the state of the system .",
    "the system makes a random jump to a new state .",
    "the basic measurement is characterized by a collection of orthogonal subspaces of the state space , together spanning the whole space ; and a real number or label , associated to each subspace .",
    "the collection of subspaces and numbers corresponds to an experiment one might do in the laboratory .",
    "when the experiment is carried out , the state vector of the quantum system is projected into one of the subspaces ( and renormalised to have length one ) ; the corresponding label becomes known in the real world ; and all this happens with probability equal to the squared length of the projection of the original state vector into the subspace . by pythagoras ,",
    "these squared lengths add up to 1 .",
    "these are all the ingredients : state vectors ( also called pure states ) , unitary evolution , entanglement ( formation of product systems ) , and ( simple ) measurement .",
    "we now go through them more formally , giving as special example the important case of a two - dimensional state space : this applies to the qubit , to a two - level system , to polarization of a photon , to spin of an electron or other ` spin - half ' particles .",
    "the only definition of a quantum system is : a physical system which satisfies the laws of quantum mechanics , and those are the laws which we are about to outline . according to modern physics , quantum mechanics rules at all levels : atoms , molecules ; light , electromagnetic radiation ; the early universe ( cosmology ) ; string theorists apply it to fundamental constituents of matter at much lower scale ( much higher energy level ) than anything which is nowadays attainable by experiment . in any case",
    ", it is a physical system ( or certain aspects of a physical system ) whose interaction with the rest of the world is so simple that it can be succesfully described according to the following picture .",
    "the state of the system is : precisely what you need to know , in order to make predictions about the results of any future experiments with the system .",
    "these predictions are probabilistic , so to be more precise : when we know the state of a system , we know the relative frequency of the possible outcomes of any possible measurement on the system , in many repetitions of the experiment : do such and such a measurement on identical copies of a system is such and such a state .",
    "identical copies just means : prepared in identical fashion .    in this section",
    "we will represent the state of a quantum system with a non - zero complex vector . in all our examples",
    ", the state space will be finite dimensional , say @xmath28-dimensional , and a state vector is therefore just a column vector of @xmath28 complex numbers .",
    "( more generally one needs to work in a separable hilbert space ) .",
    "we will use both notations @xmath29 and @xmath24 to stand for the state vector .",
    "the adjoint of this vector is the row vector containing the complex conjugates of the elements of @xmath29 .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath30 or by @xmath31 , again two notations for precisely the same thing .",
    "it follows that @xmath32 , or if you prefer @xmath33 , stands for the squared length of the vector @xmath29 ( the sum of squared abolute values of its elements ) .",
    "if @xmath29 is a state - vector , then all the non - zero vectors in the one - dimensional subspace @xmath34=\\{z\\psi : z\\in\\mathbb c\\}$ ] actually represent the same state ( i.e , the physical predictions are identical ) . conventionally , one normalizes state vectors to have length @xmath8 , thus @xmath25 .",
    "it is then easy to check that the matrix @xmath35}$ ] is the matrix which orthogonally projects a arbitrary vector to the subspace @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "since one can reconstruct the subspace @xmath34 $ ] from knowing the matrix @xmath36 , it follows that one can equally well represent states by the matrix @xmath36 as by the vector @xmath29 .",
    "even if @xmath29 is normalized , one can still multiply the state - vector by a complex number of absolute value @xmath8 , i.e. , of the form @xmath37 for some real angle @xmath38 , and get a different vector , which is also a representative of the same state .",
    "the angle @xmath39 is called a phase . so an overall phase is irrelevant , but when writing one state vector as a linear combination of others , the relative phases do make a difference .",
    "note how the at first sight clumsy notation @xmath24 , @xmath31 , helps one to graphically recognise whether one is talking about a number @xmath33 or a matrix @xmath40 .",
    "a further advantage is that we are now also able to denote state vectors by replacing the name of a vector , @xmath29 , with a verbal or graphic description of the state , as in @xmath41 and @xmath42 , or @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the notation is due to dirac ; @xmath24 , @xmath31 are called a ket and a bra respectively .",
    "the same mathematical model of a two - dimensional quantum system applies to all kinds of physical systems : the current in the delft qubit , the gound state versus first excited state of an atom at very low temperature , the spin of an electron or other so - called spin - half particle , the polarization of a photon .",
    "whatever the application , the state vector of a two dimensional quantum system can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath23 are a pair of orthonormal basis elements of @xmath47 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two complex numbers , not both zero .",
    "the labels @xmath11 and @xmath8 are conventionally used when talking about the quantum qubit ( a single quantum memory bit ) . in other contexts",
    "other descriptive labels might be appropriate , as we have seen above .",
    "normalizing the length of the vector to @xmath8 , and taking the coefficient of @xmath22 to be a real number ( which can be achieved by a suitable phase factor ) one easily sees that one can represent the state by the vector @xmath48 , for some real angles @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 .",
    "we will see in a moment , that it is very useful to think of the angles @xmath51 as polar coordinates of a real three - dimensional unit vector @xmath52 : @xmath39 is the co - latitude , i.e. , the angle you have to move down from the north pole , @xmath53 is the longitude , the angle you have to move around the globe .",
    "when we are talking about spin of an electron ( ` spin - half ' ) the direction of @xmath52 in real three - space really can be thought of , as the direction of the axis of spin of the electron .",
    "in other applications ( e.g. , polarization of a photon , see section 3 ) the interpretation might be more complicated .",
    "but the mathematics is the same . to know the state",
    ", one should equivalently specify a complex @xmath54-vector @xmath24 , real polar coordinates @xmath51 , or a real unit @xmath55-vector @xmath52 .",
    "one might denote the state vector correspondingly as @xmath24 , as @xmath56 or as @xmath57 . in the important application of a spin - half particle ,",
    "e.g. , an electron , the basis states are denoted @xmath58 and @xmath59 , ` up ' and ` down ' respectively , and the state @xmath57 really can be thought of as the state of an electron spinning in the real spatial direction @xmath60",
    ".    the matrix representation of the same state is found by some simple algebra and trigonometry to be equal to @xmath61 , where the ingredients in this formula are described as follows .",
    "bold type indicates complex two by two matrices which otherwise might be confused with numbers .",
    "thus @xmath62 is the two by two identity matrix .",
    "the arrow indicates a vector of @xmath55 components , which might be reals or matrices .",
    "@xmath63 is the real three - dimensional unit vector having polar coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "the symbol ` @xmath64 ' denotes the ordinary inner product , and @xmath65 denotes a vector of three two by two matrices , the so - called pauli spin matrices , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "so writing @xmath69 , by definition @xmath70 .",
    "each of the pauli spin matrices is self - adjoint , @xmath71 , where the adjoint of a matrix is the transpose of the matrix of complex conjugates of the original matrix elements .",
    "self - adjoint complex matrices , like real symmetric matrices , have real eigenvalues and an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors .",
    "in particular , the pauli spin matrices all have eigenvalues @xmath72 and @xmath73 , their eigenvectors are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the real three - dimensional unit vector in the @xmath78-direction , and so on .",
    "the _ opposite _ real three - vectors @xmath52 and @xmath79 correspond to _ orthogonal _ state vectors @xmath57 , @xmath80 .",
    "some useful properties of the spin matrices are @xmath81 ( and the same for cyclic permuations of @xmath82 ) , and @xmath83 .",
    "later we will extend from the so - called pure states , represented by a state vector @xmath29 , to the what are called mixed states : the state vector of the quantum system is drawn with probability distribution @xmath84 from the set of all state vectors , let us suppose them to be all normalized to length @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out ( as we will see in section 4 ) that for all physical predictions , it suffices to know no more and no less than the ordinary probability mixture @xmath85 of the corresponding state - matrices @xmath86 .",
    "this simple mathematical fact has an extraordinary consequence .",
    "suppose i give you a stream of spin - half particles , each independently prepared with equal probability in the state @xmath87 or in the state @xmath88 ( ` up ' and ` down ' ) . or ,",
    "i give you a stream of spin - half particles , each independently prepared with equal probability in the state @xmath89 or in the state @xmath90 ( ` left ' and ` right ' ) .",
    "later under the subsection on measurement , we will see how such a preparation could be made .",
    "the mixed state matrix for the first case is @xmath91 , for the second case it is @xmath92 , in both cases this average state matrix is the rather simple @xmath93 .",
    "thus whatever measurements you make on the particles , you will never be able to tell the difference between the two scenarios .",
    "the statistical predictions of any experiment you can do , would be the same .",
    "this extraordinary fact casts doubt on the idea that the state of a quantum system , as some collection of real or complex numbers , is somehow ` engraved ' permanently on individual particles ( electrons , photons , or whatever ) . if that were the case",
    ", it would be very strange that one could never decide whether a huge number of particles , each engraved with very different states , could never be distinguished .",
    "it seems that the state is not a property of an individual particle , but rather of the way a particle is created , and carries merely statistical information .",
    "this fact bothers physicists , who are not fond of randomness , a lot , but probabilists and statisticians should find it relatively easy to live with .",
    "a quantum system not acting in any way on the external world , may be influenced by it , in the following way .",
    "for any particular situation the physicist will be able to write down a self - adjoint matrix @xmath94 called the hamiltonian , or energy , and then the state at time @xmath95 of a quantum system is derived from the state at time @xmath11 by solving the differential equation @xmath96 . here",
    "@xmath97 is planck s constant , a rather small quantity of work = energy times time , and the equation we have just written down is the famous schrdinger equation .",
    "the point is , that the experimentalist might be able to arrange for the same quantum system to evolve under different hamiltonians @xmath94 , for instance if we are talking about spin of electrons , by appropriately setting up different external magnetic fields .",
    "if we are not talking about spin and magnetism , but about polarization of photons , passing light through various crystals might implement different hamiltonian evolutions .    for our finite dimensional quantum systems we can solve the equation explicitly as @xmath98 .",
    "even more explicitly , one can write the matrix @xmath94 in terms of its eigenvalue - eigenvector decomposition as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 runs through the eigenvalues of @xmath94 , which are real , and @xmath101 is a convenient notation for : the normalized eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath100 .",
    "one should actually say : a normalized eigenvector , there is still an arbitrary phase factor . and now , since @xmath102 one can solve the time evolution as @xmath103 .",
    "this shows that a given state can be expressed as a complex superposition of energy eigenstates .",
    "each eigenstate on its own evolves in a rather boring way : according to the phase factor @xmath104",
    ". however linear combinations of eigenstates can express fascinating interference effects , as the relative phases of the component eigenstates change in time .",
    "now the matrix @xmath105 has the special property of being unitary : that means precisely that @xmath106 . in other words ,",
    "the transformation @xmath107 is nothing more nor less than a change of ( orthonormal ) basis of our state - space .",
    "the key point for the applications is that any unitary matrix @xmath108 whatsoever is of the form @xmath105 for some hamiltonian @xmath94 and time length @xmath95 .",
    "thus in principle , if one could implement any particular hamiltonian in the laboratory , one can implement any unitary transformation of a state .",
    "the matrices @xmath109 and @xmath110 are both unitary , and therefore correspond to transformations of a quantum state that one might implement in a laboratory .",
    "the first maps an arbitrary state vector @xmath111 into @xmath112 , a sign change , the second maps @xmath111 into @xmath113 , the so - called spin - flip .",
    "there is a beautiful connection between the unitary transformations of states in @xmath114 and the orthorgonal rotations of corresponding unit vectors in @xmath115 , involving the pauli spin matrices , but we do not need it here .      in ordinary probability theory",
    "there is a natural way to model the bigger probability space formed by performing independently two other probability experiments .",
    "there is a very analogous , and mathematically very natural operation , for modelling the bringing together of two independent and completely separate quantum systems into ( potential ) interaction with one another .",
    "the mathematical tool for this is the notion of tensor product . a quantum system with state vector @xmath29 in a @xmath28-dimensional state space , together with another system with state vector @xmath53 in a @xmath116 dimensional state space , together form a quantum system in a @xmath117 dimensional state space , with state vector @xmath118 , by which we mean the vector containing each product of one of the @xmath28 elements of the vector @xmath29 with one of the @xmath116 elements of the vector @xmath53 , arranged in some fixed order which suits you .",
    "now this particular state is not very interesting : as we will see in the next subsection , when one does simultaneous measurements on each of the two subsystems , the outcomes are independent and distributed exactly as they would have been , considered entirely separately .",
    "but the point is that this boring product state is the state of the joint system , only at the precise moment when the two subsystems are brought together . from that moment",
    "they will evolve together under some hamiltonian . and",
    "if that hamiltonian is not of the boring form @xmath119 ( use your imagination to define the tensor product of matrices now , rather than of vectors ) , the joint state will evolve in some period of time into a new state in the huge @xmath117 dimensional space , with a state vector which can not be written in the simple product form which it had at time @xmath11 .",
    "every state vector in the big product space can be written as a complex linear combination of product states . whenever one needs a linear combination of more than one product , we call the joint state entangled",
    ". as we will see , such states have remarkable properties .",
    "the quantum computer will be built of a large collection , say @xmath26 , of simple two - level systems or qubits .",
    "thus the state of the whole system is a vector in a @xmath120 dimensional state space , including states which are not of the special form : each qubit separately in its own state .",
    "the idea of the quantum computer is to implement the logical transformations on bits , which are the basis of classical computers , as unitary transformations on qubits .",
    "it is known how in principle to do this , so that the quantum computer could compute anything which a classical computer can compute .",
    "the idea is to make use of the parallelism of complex superpositions , and entanglement between many qubits , to allow extremely fast algorithms for previously hard problems .",
    "program and data , in the form of a sequence of binary digits , would be put into the quantum computer as the states @xmath22 , @xmath23 of each of the component qubits . then unitary evolution takes over in the product space , and leads after some time interval to a new joint state .",
    "the final step is to read out again , somehow , an output of the computation , and for that we must wait till the last ingredient has been discussed , measurement .",
    "already with just two qubits , entanglement can produce fascinating effects . in section 3",
    "we will use the entangled state of two qubits @xmath121 in order to perfectly teleport another quantum state from one location to another .",
    "so far we have described only the internal behaviour of quantum systems . without any description of how the state of a quantum system can have an influence on events in the classical outside world in which you and i walk about , and where we see tables and chairs , live or dead cars , not complex vectors or tensor products , the theory is completely empty .",
    "moreover , so far the theory has been completely deterministic .",
    "statisticians and probabilists will be getting impatient .",
    "we describe here the most basic way in which we can obtain information from a quantum system .",
    "it is called a simple measurement .",
    "the idea is that we take the quantum system , bring it into interaction with some macroscopic experimental apparatus , and get to see some changes in the real world , which we quantify as a numerical measurement outcome @xmath78 .",
    "the quantum system itself is changed by this process : one of the key ideas of quantum mechanics is that you can not measure a system without disturbing it in some way .",
    "the process is random : both the outcome @xmath78 and the final state of the quantum system are random .",
    "but if for a given apparatus or experimental design , we know the initial or input state @xmath29 , and the outcome @xmath78 , we also know the final or output state .",
    "the probability distribution of the outcome depends on the initial state , and on which of the many possible measurements  which of the possible experimental apparatusses  we use .",
    "the mathematical description goes as follows .",
    "each measurement corresponds to a collection of orthogonal subspaces @xmath122 of our state space , labelled by the possible real values @xmath78 of the outcome . in our finite dimensional set - up",
    "there can be only a finite number of them , varying through some subset @xmath123 of the real numbers .",
    "the subspaces must not only be orthogonal but also span the whole state space , so that any state vector can be written as the sum of its orthogonal projections onto each of the subspaces @xmath122 .",
    "write @xmath124 for the orthogonal projector onto @xmath122 .",
    "then applying the measurement described by @xmath125 to a quantum system in state @xmath29 produces the value @xmath78 with probability @xmath126 , the squared length of the projection of the state vector into the subspace @xmath122 , and in this case the final state of the quantum system is just the renormalized projection @xmath127 . by pythagoras , and since we started with a normalized state vector , the sum of the squared lengths of the projections onto the orthogonal , spanning , subspaces @xmath122 equals @xmath8 .",
    "and of course these squared lengths are real nonnegative numbers : thus , bona fide probabilities .",
    "there is no harm in augmenting our collection of outcomes @xmath123 with further values @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath11-dimensional subspaces @xmath122 consisting just of the zero vector .",
    "the length of the projection of @xmath29 onto the null subspace is zero , so this outcome is never observed .",
    "and a null subspace is orthogonal to every subspace .",
    "an even more special case has each subspace @xmath128 one - dimensional , thus of the form @xmath129 $ ] for an orthonormal basis @xmath130 indexed by @xmath131 .",
    "then since @xmath132 one quickly sees that the result of the measurement is to yield the value @xmath78 with probability @xmath133 , in which case the final state of the quantum system is @xmath134 .",
    "the complex numbers @xmath135 are called the probability amplitudes for the transition from @xmath29 to @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "there are a couple of alternative ways to mathematially reformulate this description .",
    "one way is to note that for a given measurement @xmath125 , @xmath136 , the collection of subspaces and values ( except for null subspaces , which are irrelevant ) can be recovered from the single matrix @xmath137 .",
    "this matrix is self - adjoint ; it has real eigenvalues @xmath78 and its eigenspaces are the corresponding @xmath122 .",
    "so the matrix @xmath138 is a compact mathematical packaging of all the information which we need to specify a measurement . in physics",
    "such matrices are called observables , or physical quantities .",
    "examples we have already seen are the hamiltonian @xmath94 , or for two - level systems , the spin observables @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this compact mathematical formulation is moreover very powerful .",
    "suppose we ` measure the observable @xmath138 ' on the quantum system with state vector @xmath24 , state matrix @xmath142 .",
    "the probability to get the outcome @xmath78 is @xmath143 ( since a projection matrix is self - adjoint , @xmath144 , and idempotent , @xmath145 ) @xmath146 ( since a real number is a one - by - one matrix , hence equal to the trace of that matrix ) @xmath147 ( since one may cyclically permute matrix factors inside a trace ) @xmath148 .",
    "now multiply each probability by the value of the outcome @xmath78 , and add over the values @xmath78 ; since @xmath149 we find the celebrated trace rule , a most beautiful formula : @xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes the random outcome of measuring the observable @xmath138 , and @xmath152 denotes mathematical expectation when the ( matrix ) state of the quantum system is @xmath36 .",
    "this little formula : assigning a mean value under state @xmath36 to an observable @xmath138 ( both represented by matrices , or in greater generality , operators ) , is the starting point for the field of quantum probability , which sees the mathematical structure of self - adjoint matrices ( observables ) and states , as analogous to the usual set - up of random variables and probability measures in classical probability theory .",
    "we have a way to compute expected values @xmath153 somehow analogous to the classical formula ( where now @xmath138 is a random variable on some probability space ) @xmath154 .",
    "i shall come back to this analogy , in the afterlude to the paper .",
    "however for us , the observable @xmath138 is just a convenient packaging of its eigenspaces and eigenvalues , and does not have an intrinsic role to play as a matrix or operator somehow acting on ( multiplying ) state vectors .",
    "but i would like to mention a further ramification . for a matrix @xmath149 and a real function @xmath155",
    ", one can define the same function of the matrix @xmath156 as @xmath157 .",
    "thus : keep the same eigenspaces , replace the eigenvalues by @xmath155 of the original eigenvalues .",
    "well , this description is correct if the function @xmath155 is one - to - one ; otherwise it should be modified to say : replace the eigenvalues by @xmath155 of the eigenvalues , if several eigenvalues map to the same function value , then merge the corresponding eigenspaces ( i.e , take their linear span ) .",
    "if the function @xmath155 is ` square ' or ` exponential ' , then this curious definition does correspond to the existing , more orthodox definitions of @xmath158 or @xmath159 for a given matrix @xmath138 .",
    "now given an observable @xmath138 and a function @xmath155 we can talk about two different experiments : measure @xmath138 and evaluate the function @xmath155 on the outcome ; or directly measure @xmath156 .",
    "the resulting state of the quantum system is different if @xmath155 is many - to - one so that eigenspaces have merged ; one does not project so far when measuring @xmath156 as with measuring @xmath138 .",
    "but it is a theorem that the probability distribution of the outcomes under the two scenarios is equal , and hence so are the expected values : @xmath160 .",
    "i call this little formula , the law of the unconscious quantum physicist , since it is exactly analogous to the infamous law of the unconscious statistician in probability theory : the result that you can compute the expectation of a function @xmath155 of a random variable @xmath138 in two different ways : by integrating @xmath161 with respect to the law of @xmath138 , and by integrating @xmath162 with respect to the law of @xmath163",
    ". the quantum version of this law is part of the standard apparatus of quantum mechanics , and plays moreover a central role in foundational discussions , but is hardly ever explicitly stated let alone proved .",
    "note that it leads to the computation not only of expectations but also of complete probability distributions : if i know the mean of every function of the outcome of measuring the observable @xmath138 , i can recover the probability distribution of the outcome of measuring @xmath138 .",
    "thus all the expected values @xmath164 do enable one to build a complete probability theory .",
    "that was one way to mathematically reformulate measurement .",
    "another way goes in the opposite direction : from relatively compact to over - elaborate .",
    "yet it is very important for future developments ( section 4 ) . for any measurable subset of the real line @xmath165 , form the matrix @xmath166 . for each set",
    "@xmath165 this is a projection matrix , which projects into the sumspace of the eigenspaces of @xmath138 , for @xmath167 . as such it satisfies the three axioms of a probability measure on the real line , but now with numbers replaced by matrices : ( i ) , @xmath168 for all @xmath165 ; ( ii ) , @xmath169 for all disjoint @xmath170 with @xmath171 ; ( iii ) , @xmath172 . for a self - adjoint matrix @xmath138",
    ", the inequality @xmath173 means @xmath174 for all vectors @xmath24 .",
    "we can now rewrite our probability rule for the probability distribution of the outcomes as @xmath175 for all measurable subsets @xmath165 of our outcome space ( now considered to be all the real numbers ) . for the kind of measurements considered so far , the matrices @xmath176 are not just self - adjoint and nonnegative , but also projection matrices : idempotent , as well .",
    "we call such a collection of matrices , a projection - valued probability measure , or proprom for short . in section 4",
    "we will see that it is necessary to take a wider view of measurement .",
    "there we will meet the notion of a generalized measurement , in which we replace the projection matrices @xmath176 by arbitrary self - adjoint matrices , but still subject to the three rules of probability .",
    "we also call such generalized measurements , or rather their mathematical representations , operator - valued probabilty measures or opprom s .    in the previous section we formed the quantum analogue of product probability spaces .",
    "also observables and measurements on one component of a product system can be considered as defined on a product system .",
    "the observable @xmath138 on a subsystem corresponds to the observable @xmath177 on the product of that system with another : same eigenvalues , eigenspaces equal to the original eigenspaces tensor product with the other complete space .",
    "if @xmath138 and @xmath178 are two observables of two different quantum systems then @xmath179 and @xmath180 give an example of commuting observables : their product , taken in either order , is the same .",
    "observables which commute model measurements which may be done simultaneously .",
    "whether one first measures the one , then the other , or vica - versa , the probabilistic description of joint outcome and of final state is identical .",
    "a product system is often used to model a pair of particles at two different locations , and the observables of each subsystem correspond to measurements which may be made at the two separate locations , and which naturally do not influence one another s outcome . in particular ,",
    "if the product system is in a product state , then the outcomes of measurements on the subsystems are independent with the same distribution as if everything had been considered separately , as one naturally would desire .      for a @xmath54-dimensional state space",
    "one can only find sets of pairs of non - trivial , orthogonal subspaces , each pair corresponding to a pair of othonormal basis vectors .",
    "now as we sketched previously , there is a one - to - one correspondence between state - vectors of @xmath181 and directions ( unit vectors ) in @xmath182 .",
    "orthogonal state vectors correspond to opposite directions .",
    "let us label the two possible outcomes of one of these measurements , by the real values @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then each of the non - trival simple measurements corresponds to the two projector matrices @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "the two add up to the identity matrix , and can also be written , as we saw before as @xmath185 . the corresponding observable ( matrix ) is @xmath186 , or as the physicists say ` the spin observable in the direction @xmath187 ' .",
    "a little computation shows that the probability of the two outcomes @xmath188 , when this observable is measured on a quantum system in the state @xmath57 , is @xmath189 .",
    "the resulting state of the particle is @xmath190 .",
    "this has the implication that one can prepare particles in a given state , say @xmath191,by measuring particles in any state and only keeping those , for which the outcome was @xmath72 .",
    "thus measurement , often thought of as being a final stage of an experiment , might also be the initial stage called ` preparation ' .",
    "this measurement is realized on the spin of electrons in a so - called stern - gerlach device , a specially shaped magnet which can be physically oriented in the real direction @xmath187 and carries out precisely the measurement just described .",
    "electrons leave the magnet in two streams , in one stream all particles have the state @xmath191 , in the other they all have the state @xmath192 .",
    "the relative sizes of the two output streams depends on the initial states of the electrons .",
    "we will illustrate the ingredients by the beautiful example of quantum teleportation , discovered by charles bennett ( ibm ) _ et al . _  in the mid nineties , and done in the laboratory , just a couple of years later , by anton zeilinger , in innsbruck . since then the experiment has been repeated in many places .",
    "the experiment is done with polarized photons , and the basis states can be thought of as @xmath193 ( @xmath78 direction ) , @xmath194 ( @xmath162-direction ) .",
    "it is useful here to give some further discussion of how polarization of photons can be reformulated in the language of qubits .",
    "think of light coming towards you in the @xmath195 direction , and oscillating sinusoidally , with the same frequency , but possibly different relative amplitude and phase , in both both the @xmath78 direction and the @xmath162 direction .",
    "the oscillations generate a ( perhaps flattened ) spiral around the @xmath195 direction , coming towards you .",
    "head on , you see an elliptical motion around the @xmath195 axis which might be directed clockwise or anticlockwise ; the ellipse might be perfectly circular or perfectly flat ( a line segement ) or anything in between ; the orientation of the major axis of the ellipse can be anything in the @xmath78-@xmath162 plane . the perfectly flat version is how light comes out of a polarization filter ( e.g. , your sunglasses : the oscillation occurs entirely in one plane ) .",
    "now imagine mapping all the different ` directed , oriented , ellipses ' onto the surface of the three - dimensional real sphere as follows : the clockwise ellipses on the northern hemisphere , the anticlockwise on the southern ; the ` flat ' ellipses are arranged around the equator , and the two circles are at the north pole and the south pole .",
    "as one moves completely around the earth , at constant latitude , the direction of the ellipse rotates slowly around @xmath196 . in short : all possible polarizations of light ( all possible shapes of directed , oriented , ellipses ) can be mapped one - to - one onto the directions in real three - dimensional space .",
    "now light behaves both as a wave and as a stream of particles ( photons ) .",
    "in fact this is the essence of a quantum mechanical description ; what we now know is that wave - particle duality extends to all known physical objects ( for instance : photons , electrons , neutrons , protons ; but also at higher and lower scales ) .",
    "the quantum state of polarization of one photon is described by a two dimensional state vector @xmath57 .",
    "all possible transformations of the state of polarization correspond to orthogonal rotations of the real vector @xmath52 , and to unitary transformations of the quantum state vector @xmath57 .",
    "they can be implemented in the laboratory by passing the light through suitable transparent media ( fluids and crystals ) .",
    "moreover any simple measurement or preparation can be implemented with beam splitters and polarization filters .",
    "now the problem of teleportation is as follows .",
    "alice , who lives in amsterdam , is given a qubit ( polarized photon ) in an unknown state , say @xmath197 .",
    "she wants to transmit it to bob , who lives in beijing , and she can only communicate with bob by email .",
    "( if you prefer , replace amsterdam and beijing with , perhaps futuristically , pyongyang and seoul ) . what can she do ?",
    "she could measure the qubit , e.g. , look to see if the photon is polarized @xmath198 or @xmath199 .",
    "she gets the answer : `` @xmath198 '' or `` @xmath199 '' ; the answer is random , with probabilities @xmath200 , @xmath201 depending on the unknown @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the photon s original state is destroyed , we can not learn anything more about it .",
    "so all she could do is email to bob : `` i saw ( e.g. ) @xmath198 '' .",
    "he makes a horizontally polarized photon .",
    "this is a poor , random , copy of the original one , and the original one has gone .",
    "can they do better ?",
    "well , there are many other measurements alice could make , but they all have the same property , of only providing a small , random , amount of information about the original state , and destroying it in the process .",
    "in fact it is a result from the theory of quantum statistical inference due to @xcite , that whatever measurement is carried out by alice , the fisher information matrix based on the probability distribution of the outcome of the experiment , concerning the unknown parameters @xmath202 , has a strictly positive lower bound .",
    "the famous no - cloning theorem could also be invoked here : it is impossible to convert one quantum system into two identical copies .",
    "we will review this result in section 5 .    in order to succeed ,",
    "alice and bob need a further resource .",
    "what they do is arrange that each of them has another photon , these two ( extra ) photons in the entangled joint state @xmath203 .",
    "this particular state is called the singlet , or bell state .",
    "this is nowadays a routine matter .",
    "it is created by having someone else , at a location between amsterdam and beijing , excite a calcium atom with a laser in such a way that the atom moves to a higher energy level .",
    "then the energy rapidly decays and two photons are emitted , in equal and opposite directions .",
    "one travels to amsterdam , the other to beijing .",
    "now we have three qubits , living together in an eight - dimensional space , of which four of the dimensions  two of the qubits  are on alice s desk , the other two dimensions  one qubit  on bob s desk .",
    "below we will see three lines of elementary algebra , with the astounding implication that alice can carry out a measurement on her desk , get one of @xmath204 random outcomes , each with probability @xmath205 , then email to bob which outcome she obtained ; he correspondingly carries out one of @xmath204 different , prescribed , unitary operations , and now his photon is magically transformed into an identical copy of the original , unknown , qubit which was given to alice .",
    "two ( unknown ) complex numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been transmitted , with complete accuracy , by transmitting two bits of classical information .",
    "( more accurately , two real numbers , say @xmath51 ; but this is just as amazing ) .",
    "now it is worth asking : how can we know that a certain experiment has actually succeeded ?",
    "the answer is of course by statistics .",
    "one needs , many times , to provide alice with qubits in various states .",
    "some of these times , the qubits are not teleported , but are measured in alice s laboratory .",
    "on the other occasions , the qubits are teleported to bob , and then measured in bob s laboratory .",
    "the predictions of quantum theory are that the _ statistics _ of the measurements at alice s place , are the same as the statistics of the measurements at bob s place .",
    "so suppose a single spin - half particle with state - vector @xmath45 is brought into interaction with a pair of particles in the singlet state , written abbreviatedly as @xmath206 ( and discarding a constant factor ) .",
    "i am using the following shorthand : for instance , @xmath207 is written as @xmath208 .",
    "the order of the three components is throughout : first the particle to be teleported ( on alice s desk in amsterdam ) , then alice s part of the singlet pair ( also on her desk ) , then bob s part of the singlet pair ( on his desk in beijing ) .",
    "the whole @xmath209 dimensional system has state - vector , multiplying out all ( tensor ) products of sums of state vectors , and up to a factor @xmath210 , @xmath211 .",
    "now we introduce the following four orthogonal state - vectors for the two particles in amsterdam , neglecting another constant factor @xmath210 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and we note that our three particles together are in a pure state with state - vector which may be written ( up to yet another factor , @xmath216 ) @xmath217 . rearranging these terms ( noting that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are numbers so can be moved through the tensor products at will ) one finds the state @xmath218 .",
    "so far nothing has happened at all : we have simply rewritten the state - vector of the three particles as a superposition of four state - vectors , each lying in one of four orthogonal two - dimensional subspaces of @xmath219 : namely the subspaces @xmath220\\otimes\\mathbb c ^2 $ ] , @xmath221\\otimes\\mathbb c ^2 $ ] , @xmath222\\otimes\\mathbb c ^2 $ ] and @xmath223\\otimes\\mathbb c ^2 $ ] .    to these four subspaces",
    "corresponds a simple measurement .",
    "it only involves the two particles in amsterdam and hence may be carried out by alice .",
    "she obtains one of four different outcomes , each with probability @xmath224 , so she learns nothing about the particle to be teleported .",
    "however , conditional on the outcome of her measurement , the particle in beijing is in one of the four states @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 .",
    "so bob knows that he has with probability @xmath224 , either of those four states .",
    "it can be verified that whatever he does with that particle , his statistical predictions are the same as before alice made her measurement : nothing has changed at beijing , yet ! but once the outcome of the measurement at amsterdam is transmitted to beijing ( two bits of information , transmitted by classical means ) , bob is able by means of one of four unitary transformations to transform the resulting pure state into the state with state - vector @xmath229 .",
    "for instance , if the first of the four possibilities is realized , bob must change the sign and carry out a spin - flip to convert @xmath225 into @xmath45 .",
    "he does not need any knowledge of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to do this : he just carries out two fixed unitary transformations . in each of the four cases ,",
    "there is a fixed unitary transformation which does the job .",
    "neither alice nor bob learn anything at all about the particle being teleported by this procedure .",
    "in fact , if they did get any information about @xmath3 and @xmath4 the teleportation would have been less than succesful .",
    "one can not learn about the state of a quantum system without ( at least ) partially destroying it .",
    "the information one gains is random .",
    "there is no going back .",
    "we are close to describing new and interesting statistical problems . however ,",
    "first we must extend the notion of state , and the notion of measurement , used so far .",
    "suppose we want to get information about the state of some quantum system . there is more that we can do than just carry out one simple measurement on the given system .",
    "we could for instance first bring the system being studied into interaction with another quantum system , in some known state . after a unitary evolution of the joint system , one could measure the auxiliary system .",
    "next , discard this system , and bring the original particle ( which is now in some new state , dependent on the results so far ) , into interaction with another auxiliary system .",
    "do the same again . at each stage",
    "one could allow the various operations ( initial state of the auxiliary system , unitary transformation , measurement of auxiliary system  ) to depend on the outcomes obtained so far .",
    "finally after some number of operations , take some function of all the outcomes obtained in the intermediate steps .",
    "this provides a vast repertoire of possible strategies , and it seems impossible to describe `` everything that can be done '' in a concise and mathematically tractable way , in order to optimize over this collection .",
    "it is not actually clear in advance that these more elaborate measurement schemes could be useful , but it is a fact that they arise in practice , and moreover that they often provide strictly better solutions to statistical design problems , than the simple measurements !    secondly , the notion of state is just a little restricted .",
    "suppose that each time a qubit is manufactured , slight variations in temperature , materials , and so on produce slightly different states .",
    "the identical copies we are given are not single qubits in an elementary , so - called pure , state , but are actually i.i.d .",
    "drawings from a probability distribution over pure states .",
    "it seems that we need to know : the complete distribution of pure states , that the experimenter is sampling from . again",
    "this would seem to be an unwieldly , complicated , object .    amazingly both the complications lead after a beautiful synthesis into generalized notions of state and of measurement which are very compact and amenable to mathematical analysis .",
    "moreover , the syntheses ( very different composite measurements may be represented by the same , compact , mathematical object , and similarly , completely different probability distributions over pure states can not be distinguished either ) highlights new and extraordinary features of quantum reality .",
    "recall that we could describe the state of a quantum system with the matrix @xmath142 rather than the vector @xmath24 .",
    "now suppose that according to one scenario , quantum systems in states @xmath230 are produced with probabilities @xmath231 , and measured in any complicated way allowed by the rules of quantum mechanics ( i.e. , using the ingredients of section 2 , in any combination ) .",
    "in another scenario , quantum systems in states @xmath232 are produced with probabilities @xmath233 , and measured in the same way .",
    "suppose that the two scenarios are such the _ average _ state matrix is the same : @xmath234 , say . suppose the final outcome of measurement is some outcome @xmath78 in an arbitrary ( now possibly very large ) measurable sample space @xmath235 .",
    "now if we have specified the measurement procedure , however complicated it is , then the rules from section 2 allow us to compute the probability law of the random outcome @xmath138 under either of the two scenarios",
    ". then one can state the following theorems :    the probability distribution of @xmath138 , i.e. , the collection of probabilities @xmath236 , only depends on the average or mixed state @xmath36 ; i.e. , it is the same under our two scenarios , whatever the measurement protocol .",
    "moreover the mapping from mixed state matrix @xmath36 to probability law of outcome is affine , i.e. , linear under convex combinations of state matrices @xmath36 .",
    "any affine mapping from mixed state matrices @xmath36 to probability distributions on @xmath237 is of the form @xmath238 where @xmath239 is an operator - valued probability measure ( oprom ) ; i.e. , @xmath240 is a self - adjoint matrix for every @xmath165 satisfying the axioms of a probability measure : @xmath241 for all @xmath165 ; @xmath242 ; @xmath243 whenever @xmath165 is the disjoint countable union of @xmath170 .",
    "any operator - valued probability measure can be realized by bringing the quantum system being measured into interaction with an auxiliary system ( so - called ancilla ) in some fixed state @xmath244 , applying a unitary evolution to the joint system , applying a simple measurement to the ancilla , and discarding the ancilla .",
    "this sequence of results tells us : everything that is allowed by quantum mechanics , is necessarily of the form of an oprom . and",
    "conversely , every oprom can in principle be realized , by a procedure which one might call quantum randomization , since it is based on forming a product system with a completely independent system , and then measuring the joint system .",
    "( in the literature , the abbreviation pom or povm is often used , standing for ` probability - operator measure ' , or ` positive operator valued measure ' ; in our opinion that nomenclature is inaccurate ) .",
    "every mixture of state matrices is a non - negative self - adjoint matrix with trace @xmath8 .",
    "such a matrix is called a density matrix and every density matrix can be realized as a mixture of pure states , states of the form @xmath40 , in general in very many ways .",
    "the pure states have density matrices which are idempotent , @xmath245 .",
    "these can not be written as a probability mixture over more than one state .",
    "recall that the simple measurements could be represented with projection - valued probability measures .",
    "so a modest mathematical extension of our basic notions allows us to encompass everything that quantum mechanics allows , in a concise and powerful way .",
    "the underlying mathematical theorems here are due to naimark , holevo , ozawa and others ; see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they can be extended to describe in precisely the same way , not just the mapping from input state to observed data , but also to observed data and output state , conditional on the observed data .",
    "this leads to the somewhat sophisticated mathematical notion of completely positive instruments and conditional states ; the main theorems are due to stinespring , davies , kraus and again ozawa .",
    "the paper @xcite contains many references to these and further devlopments .",
    "in particular there is great interest presently in modelling continuous time measurement of a quantum system , or continuous time interaction of a quantum system with a much larger environment , leading to a rich theory of quantum stochastic processes .",
    "recall that the pure state matrices of a qubit are of the form @xmath246 where @xmath52 is a unit vector in real three - space .",
    "arbitrary probability mixtures of such states ( corresponding to preparing a pure state chosen by a classical randomization from some probability distribution over the unit vectors in @xmath182 ) can therefore be completely described by the resulting mixture of state matrices , which must be of the form @xmath247 where now @xmath248 is an arbitrary vector in the real three - dimensional unit ball . a simple measurement of spin in the direction @xmath187 , of this quantum system , results in outcomes @xmath249 with probabilities @xmath250 .",
    "if we had many copies of the quantum system , we could determine the vector @xmath248 to arbitrary precision by carrying out large numbers of measurements of spin in three orthorgonal directions , e.g , the @xmath78 , @xmath162 and @xmath195 directions .",
    "is this the most accurate way to determing @xmath248 when we have a large number @xmath26 of copies at our disposal ?    the generalized measurements or oprom s form a huge class of possible experimental designs .",
    "here we just mention one such measurement .",
    "it has an outcome space consisting of just three outcomes , let us call them @xmath8 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath251 , @xmath252 , denote three unit vectors in the same plane through the origin in @xmath182 , at angles of @xmath253 to one another .",
    "then the matrices @xmath254 define an operator - valued probability measure on the sample space @xmath255 which is called the triad , or mercedes - benz .",
    "it turns up as the optimal solution to the decision problem : suppose a qubit is generated in one of the three states @xmath256 , @xmath252 , with equal probabilities .",
    "what decision rule gives you the maximum probability of guessing the actual state correctly ? there is no way to equal the success probability of this method , if one only uses simple measurements , even allowing for ( classically ) randomized procedures .",
    "one could say that quantum randomization is sometimes necessary to maximally extract information from a quantum system .",
    "the triad could be realized by bringing the system under study into interaction with another three - dimensional system in a certain , fixed , state , carrying out a certain unitary transformation on the joint system , and then carrying out a certain simple measurement on the ancilla .",
    "another measurement which occurs as the optimal solution to some estimation problems has outcomes which are continuously distributed real unit vectors ; the matrix elements of the oprom @xmath240 have density @xmath257 with respect to lebesgue ( surface ) measure on the unit sphere .",
    "it would be realized in practice by coupling the qubit to a quantum system with infinite dimensional state space .",
    "suppose we are given @xmath26 qubits in an identical , unknown , state , what is the best way to determine that state ? it is known ( by the statistical information bound we are about to discuss ) that whatever one does , one can not achieve better than a certain degree of accuracy , of the order of size of @xmath258 .",
    "it is not known what constant over @xmath259 , is best . and",
    "a most intriguing question , only partially solved , is : does it pay off to consider the @xmath26 qubits as one joint system , having a state of a the special form @xmath260 in a @xmath27 dimensional state space , or can one just as well measure them separately ?",
    "note that by considering the @xmath26 copies as one collective system , we have a much vaster repertoire of possible measurements , so from a mathematical point of view , the answer should surely be that joint measurements pay off .",
    "however physical intuition would perhaps say the opposite .",
    "i have worked on asymptotic versions of this problem .",
    "so far physicists have hardly considered this route , and the literature has mainly seen calculations in rather special situations ( @xmath261 , for instance ) , with conclusions which depend on all kinds of features of the problem  prior distributions , loss functions  which are really arbitrary .",
    "the advantage of my approach is that these extraneous and arbitrary features become irrelevant for large , but finite @xmath26 ; the problem _ localizes _ , second order approximations are good , loss functions might as well be quadratic , prior distributions are irrelevant . using the van trees inequality ( a bayesian cramr",
    " rao bound , see @xcite ) i have , together with serge massar , derived _ frequentist _",
    "large sample results on what is asymptotically best , under various measurement scenarios ; see the survey paper @xcite and the original work @xcite .",
    "further results are contained in @xcite ; and a more comprehensive survey paper by @xcite is in preparation .",
    "similar results have been obtained , interestingly , with quite different methods , in a series of papers , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and citethayashimatsumoto98 .",
    "the most exciting result we have found is as follows : if the unknown state is known to be pure , then a certain very simple but adaptive strategy of basic yes / no measurements on the separate qubits , achieves the maximal achievable accuracy .",
    "if however the state is mixed , then we do not know the best strategy .",
    "limited to separate measurements , we do know what can be achieved .",
    "we know that joint measurements can achieve startling increases in accuracy .",
    "but we do not know how much can be maximally achieved ( there are known bounds , but they are known to be unachievable ) .",
    "this seems to be a promising research direction .",
    "the ` pure state ' solution is as follows .",
    "first get a rough estimate of the direction of spin by measuring the spin in the @xmath78 , @xmath162 and @xmath195 directions separately , on a large number , but small fraction , of the particles ; say , on @xmath259 particles each .",
    "now do a simple measurement of the spin on each half of the remaining @xmath262 particles , in two perpendicular directions _ orthogonal _ to the direction of the rough estimate . in the physics literature",
    "it has been suggested that one should try as well as possible , to measure in the same direction as the unknown spin  basically the opposite to our solution .",
    "and the simple strategy just described , is asymptotically as good as anything else one can imagine , however sophisticated , on all @xmath26 particles together . in particular",
    "it is asymptotically as good as the the theoretically optimal solution for a uniform prior distribution and certain rather special loss functions , namely a beautiful but practically impossible to implement generalized measurement on the collective of particles .      in this subsection",
    "i want to prove and discuss a central and now classical result on the design of optimal quantum measurements , the quantum cramr ",
    "rao inequality and quantum information bound .",
    "the quantum information matrix plays a key role in the results i have just mentioned , though new quantum information bounds are needed , as we will see .",
    "we first introduce analogues to the score function and information matrix of classical statistics : the quantum score and the quantum information . just as the classical score function",
    "can be thought of both as a random variable , and as the derivative of the logarithm of the probability density , so is the quantum score both an observable ( self - adjoint matrix ) and a certain kind of derivative of the density matrix .",
    "the quantum information is the mean of the squared quantum score , just as in classical statistics , except that now the mean is taken using the trace rule for expectations of outcomes of measurements of observables .    consider a quantum statistical model : that is to say a parametric family of density matrices @xmath263 . a measurement @xmath264 with outcome space @xmath237 and with density @xmath265 with respect to a ( real ) sigma - finite measure @xmath266 is given .",
    "when we apply the measurement to a quantum system with state @xmath267 in this model , we obtain an outcome with density @xmath268 with respect to @xmath266 . for this classical parametric statistical model",
    ", one can compute the fisher information matrix ; we denote it as @xmath269 .    for the moment , suppose that the parameter space is one - dimensional .",
    "we define the so - called quantum score as follows : it is implicitly defined as the self - adjoint matrix @xmath270 which solves the equation @xmath271 . here",
    ", @xmath272 denotes the derivative of @xmath267 with respect to @xmath39 ( the matrix of derivatives of matrix elements ) . just as the state @xmath36 depends on @xmath39 , so also do @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "now the quantum information ( number ) is defined as @xmath274 . from what we learnt before",
    ", this number is the mean value of the square of the outome of a measurement of the observable @xmath275 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath39 is actually a vector , then one defines quantum scores component - wise , and finally defines the quantum information matrix elementwise by @xmath276 .",
    "the following quantum information inequality due to @xcite is crucial : @xmath277 for all measurements @xmath264 . from this inequality",
    "one immediately has the quantum cramr ",
    "rao inequality , @xcite : for all measurements @xmath264 , and any unbiased estimator @xmath278 based on the outcome of that measurement , @xmath279    to prove the information inequality we need to express the fisher information in the outcome of @xmath264 in terms of the quantum score . since @xmath280 it follows that @xmath281 . thus the classical score function is @xmath282",
    ".    from now , @xmath39 is fixed .",
    "define @xmath283 and @xmath284 .",
    "define @xmath285 , @xmath286 , and @xmath287 .",
    "note that @xmath288 .",
    "the proof of the quantum information inequality consists of three steps .",
    "the first will be an application of the trivial inequality @xmath289 with equality if and only if @xmath290 . the second will be an application of the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality @xmath291 with equality if and only if @xmath292 and @xmath165 are linearly dependent over the complex numbers .",
    "the last step consists of replacing an integral of a nonnegative function over @xmath293 by an integral over @xmath123 .",
    "here is the complete proof : @xmath294 in the last step we used that @xmath295 .",
    "one can verify that equality holds , if and only if @xmath296 for some real @xmath297 , for @xmath298 almost all @xmath78 . under smoothness , positivity and nondegeneracy conditions , this tells us that for optimal fisher information , an attaining measurement @xmath264 can be nothing else than the simple measurement of the quantum score observable @xmath275 . in general",
    ", this measurement does attain the information inequality .    for vector parameters the information inequality and cramr  rao inequality",
    "remain true ; the proof follows by considering all smooth one - dimensional submodels , whose classical and quantum score functions are of course linear combinations of the component scores .    for the models for one qubit which we have been studying , the parameter @xmath39 might be taken to be the real vector @xmath52 or @xmath248 of a completely unknown pure state , or completely unknown mixed state .",
    "the quantum information matrices for either of these models is easy to compute , and is as one might expect strictly positive .    now",
    "this result already tells us a great deal .",
    "first of all , it is not difficult to show that the quantum information for @xmath26 identical copies of a quantum statistical model , i.e. , with density matrix @xmath299 , is @xmath26 times the information in one copy",
    ". thus even if one uses elaborate measurements on a joint system of @xmath26 identical copies , one can not beat the @xmath300 of classical statistics .",
    "moreover , just thinking about one copy : one can not determine the quantum state exactly by doing elaborate enough measurements : otherwise the quantum information would not be strictly positive . and",
    "we have a proof of the no - cloning theorem : if by combining the basic ingredients of quantum mechanics in some way we could convert one copy of an unknown quantum state into two identical copies , we could make an arbitrary large number of identical copies , and hence estimate the state arbitrarily well , but this contradicts the positive information bound .",
    "much more comes out of it .",
    "suppose the parameter is one - dimensional .",
    "then the best measurement in terms of fisher information is to measure the quantum score . but that typically depends on @xmath39 and moreover for different @xmath39 , the scores @xmath275 do not commute .",
    "so there typically is no single measurement which achieves the information bound uniformly in the parameter value .",
    "however for large @xmath26 one can get close : using a small number of copies , get a rough estimate of @xmath39 , then measure the ` estimated score ' on the remaining copies . for large @xmath26",
    "this will be close to measuring the true but unknown score on all copies , hence close to attaining the information bound on the collective . and",
    "thus the maximum likelihood estimator based on the data , will approximately achieve the cramr - rao bound .    but now suppose the parameter is not scalar .",
    "typically the score observables for the different components of @xmath39 do not commute .",
    "this means that even if you ( roughly ) know the value of @xmath39 , completely different and mututally incompatible experiments are needed to determine the different components of @xmath39 as well as possible .",
    "now we seem to be stuck .",
    "the quantum information inequality is the best matrix inequality one can have , but it does not delineate the class of attainable classical information matrices ; i.e. , not every matrix @xmath301 with @xmath302 is the information matrix of some measurement @xmath264 at @xmath39 .",
    "thus we need something better , in order to describe what can be done .      in classical statistics , the cramr ",
    "rao bound is attainable uniformly in the unknown parameter only under rather special circumstances .",
    "on the other hand , the restriction to unbiased estimators is hardly made in practice and indeed is difficult to defend .",
    "however , we have a richly developed asymptotic theory which states that in large samples certain estimators ( e.g. , the maximum likelihood estimator ) are approximately unbiased and approximately normally distributed with variance attaining the cramr  rao bound",
    ". moreover , no estimator can do better , in various precise mathematical senses ( the hjek  lecam asymptotic local minimax theorem and convolution theorem , for instance ) .",
    "recent work by @xcite , surveyed in @xcite , makes a first attempt to carry over these ideas to quantum statistics .",
    "the approach is firstly to delineate more precisely the class of attainable information matrices @xmath303 based on arbitrary ( or special classes ) of measurements on the model of @xmath26 identical particles each in the same state @xmath267 .",
    "next , using the van trees inequality , a bayesian version of the cramr ",
    "rao inequality , see @xcite , bounds on @xmath303 are converted into bounds on the asymptotic scaled mean quadratic error matrix of regular estimators of @xmath39 .",
    "thirdly , one constructs measurements and estimators which achieve those bounds asymptotically .",
    "the first step yields the following theorem .    in the model of @xmath26 identical copies of a quantum system with state @xmath267 on a @xmath28 dimensional state space and with @xmath304 dimensional parameter @xmath39 , one has @xmath305 in any of the following cases : ( i ) @xmath306 and @xmath307 , or ( ii ) @xmath36 is a pure state , or ( iii ) the measurement @xmath308 is multi - local .",
    "a multi - local measurement is a measurement which is composed in an arbitrary way of a sequence of instruments acting on separate particles .",
    "thus it is allowed that the measurement made on particle @xmath54 depends on the outcome of the measurement on particle @xmath8 , and even that after these two measurements , yet another measurement , depending on the results so far , is made on the first particle in its new state , etc .    in the spin - half case the bound of",
    "the above theorem is achievable in the sense that for any matrix @xmath301 such that @xmath309 , there exists a measurement @xmath264 on one particle , generally depending on @xmath39 , such that @xmath310 .",
    "the measurement is a randomised choice of several simple measurements of spin , one spin direction for each component of @xmath39 .",
    "application of the van trees inequality gives the following asymptotic bound :    in the model of @xmath26 identical copies of system @xmath267 , let @xmath311 denote the limiting scaled mean quadratic error matrix of a regular sequence of estimators @xmath312 based on a sequence of measurements @xmath308 on @xmath26 particles ; i.e. , @xmath313 .",
    "then @xmath314 satisfies the inequality @xmath315 in any of the following cases : ( i ) @xmath306 and @xmath28=2 , or ( ii ) @xmath36 is a pure state , or ( iii ) the measurements @xmath308 are multi - local .",
    "a _ regular estimator sequence _ is one for which the mean quadratic error matrices converge uniformly in @xmath39 to a continuous limit .",
    "it is also possible to give a version of the theorem in terms of convergence in distribution , hjek - regularity and @xmath314 the mean quadratic error matrix of the limiting distribution , rather than the limit of the mean quadratic error .    in the spin - half case",
    ", this bound is also asymptically achievable , in the sense that for any continuous matrix function @xmath316 such that @xmath317 there exists a sequence of separable measurements @xmath308 with asymptotic scaled mean quadratic error matrix equal to @xmath318 .",
    "this result is proved by consideration of a rather natural two - stage measurement procedure .",
    "firstly , on a small ( asymptotically vanishing ) proportion of the particles , carry out arbitrary measurements allowing consistent estimation of @xmath39 , resulting in a preliminary estimate @xmath319 .",
    "then on each of the remaining particles , carry out the measurement @xmath320 ( on each separate particle ) which is optimal in the sense that @xmath321 .",
    "estimate @xmath39 by maximum likelihood estimation , conditional on the value of @xmath319 , on the outcomes obtained in the second stage . for large @xmath26 , since @xmath319 will then be close to the true value of @xmath39 , the measurement @xmath320 will have fisher information @xmath322 close to that of the ` optimal ' measurement on one particle with fisher information @xmath323 . by the usual properties of maximum likelihood estimators",
    ", it will therefore have scaled mean quadratic error close to @xmath316 .    in the spin - half case",
    "we have therefore a complete asymptotic efficiency theory in any of the three cases ( i ) a one - dimensional parameter , ( ii ) a pure state , ( iii ) multi - local measurements . by",
    "` complete ' we mean that it is precisely known what is the set of all attainable limiting scaled mean quadratic error matrices .",
    "this collection is described in terms of the quantum information matrix for one particle .",
    "what is interesting is that when none of these three conditions hold , greater asymptotic precision is possible .",
    "for instance , @xcite exhibit a generalized measurement of two spin - half particles with seven possible outcomes , which , for a completely unknown mixed state ( a three - parameter model ) , has about @xmath324 larger total fisher information ( for certain parameter values ) than any separable measurement on two particles .",
    "therefore if one has a large number @xmath26 of particles , one has about @xmath325 better precision when using the maximum likelihood estimator applied to the outcomes of this measurement on @xmath326 pairs of particles , than any separable measurement whatsoever on all @xmath26 .",
    "it is not known whether taking triples , quadruples , etc . , allows even greater increases of precision , but it seems possible that going to pairs , is enough .",
    "it would be valuable to delineate precisely the set all attainable fisher information matrices when non - separable measurements are allowed on each number of particles .",
    "the measurement in question has seven matrix elements .",
    "the first is : half the projector onto the subspace generated by @xmath327 .",
    "the next five are obtained by replacing ` @xmath328 ' with ` @xmath329 ' and or @xmath78 with @xmath162 or with @xmath195 .",
    "the seventh is the projector onto the state spanned by the singlet or bell state , which we used in teleportation !",
    "this measurement is optimal at the completely mixed state @xmath330 for estimating @xmath248 in the model @xmath331 , with any loss function which is locally rotation invariant .",
    "a similar instance of this phenomenon was called _",
    "non - locality without entanglement _ by @xcite .",
    "one could say that though the @xmath26 particles are not in an entangled state , one needs an ` entangled measurement ' , presumably brought about by bringing the particles into interaction with one another ( unitary evolution starting from the product state ) before measurement , in order to extract maximal information about their state . the word ` non - locality ' refers to the possibility that the @xmath26 particles could be widely separated and brought into interaction through other entangled particles ;",
    "as we saw in section 3 there are other examples of this kind in the context of optimal information transmission and in teleportation .",
    "at the beginning of the last ( 20th ) century , two sciences were born and made amazing strides : genetics , and quantum physics . in both sciences",
    ", randomness plays a central part . whereas this was recognised from the start in genetics  r.a .",
    "fisher is well known to biologists , first and foremost , as a great pioneer in genetics  in quantum physics this has always been consigned to obscurity , neglect , or suppression ( einstein s `` god does not throw dice '' ) .",
    "now at the beginning of the 21st century we seem to be at the threshhold of amazing strides in genetics ( molecular biology ) . while biologists claim that this is going to be the century of molecular biology , physicists argue , also with good reason , that it is going to be the century of quantum physics .",
    "i would be surprised if in the coming years , we did not see extraordinary advances in physics , in particular , in new quantum technologies .",
    "i believe that randomness does play a central role in these developments , and that mathematical statisticians can and should be involved .",
    "i think that the randomness involved in quantum mechanics is randomness which can be described by classical probability theory .",
    "however authorities both from physics and from mathematics have argued that ` quantum probability is a different kind of probability ' ( feynmann ) or that ` quantum probability is a strict extension of classical probability ' .",
    "now in some technical senses this is true .",
    "if you like to see classical probability theory as part of functional analysis , then it is possible to see the algebra of observables of a quantum system as a strictly more general kind of mathematical structure than the algebra of random variables on a fixed probability space .",
    "however as we have argued above , the observables of quantum mechanics are just an intermediary to deriving the probability distributions of outcomes of experiments which could actually be done in the laboratory , and then the classical rules of probability theory apply .",
    "one could just as well argue that the mathematical structure of quantum probability theory is a special case of that of classical mathematical statistics : it is namely equivalent to a collection of classical probability models linked in a rather special way , though statisticians are able to consider arbitrary collections of probability models .",
    "another reason why many have claimed that quantum randomness is different , is because it can be shown , for instance by considering measurements on the two photons in the entangled joint state we used for teleportation , that any _ deterministic _ explanation of the randomness in quantum measurements , can not be described by mere statistical variation in hidden or uncontrolled variables of the quantum systems , without those variables violating _ locality_. to say it in a different way , any deterministic explanation of what goes on in our teleportation example , has to require instantaneous communication from amsterdam to beijing through the entangled pair of photons . though physicists are not happy with randomness , they are even less happy with ` action at a distance ' as this is called .",
    "thus the randomness in quantum mechanics is of a different nature to the randomness in a classical coin toss , for which perfectly determinstic rules determine the outcome , starting from the initial conditions .",
    "however , if one accepts that randomness of a fundamental ( unexplainable ) nature is real , there is not a problem .",
    "see my web pages for reprints and preprints further discussing these problems .",
    "this brings us to some other philosophical problems , which for me are another good reason to be interested in quantum mechanics , since they are fundamental issues in physics , deeply connected to probability and statistics .",
    "we saw in section 2 , three deterministic items concerning behaviour of quantum systems ` on their own ' , but a completely different and stochastic behaviour when that quantum system is brought into interaction with a measurement apparatus , or more generally , with the real world .",
    "but a measurement apparatus is just a physical system itself , and the system being measured and apparatus doing that , together should just be making one large unitary evolution in some huge state space .",
    "there are no random jumps , no irreversible losses of information",
    ". then the same applies if we consider ourselves , the observer of the outcome of an experiment , as just another physical system  .",
    "this is called the measurement problem .",
    "most working physicists are not bothered by it , since they are perfectly able to get perfect predictions of experimental results , without worrying about the philosophical consistency of the mathematical model .",
    "however some scientists are deeply worried about it , and there are a number of proposals to modify quantum mechanics , or just to modify the interpretation rules ( the rules by which one draws conclusions from the mathematical model back to reality ) .",
    "however if one does not attempt to make a mathematical model of all of the physical universe , and only models small parts of it , then the only problem is a consistency problem , since one might draw the line between quantum system and classical outside world , at different levels .",
    "working physicists try to draw the border at as macroscopic level as possible , and are content that the model prediction at macroscopic level is ` as if ' a quantum jump had taken place to one of several macroscopically distinct states , with probabilities which can be calculated theoretically , and which are moreover beautifully confirmed by experiment .",
    "it seems to me that careful analysis by mathematical statisticians and probabilists could be highly valuable , to sift the crazy from the sensible solutions to the measurement problem .",
