    "the formation of black hole ( bh ) seeds and their evolution have been the subject of several theoretical investigations .",
    "the `` flow - chart '' presented rees ( 1978 ) still stands as a guideline for the possible paths leading to formation of bh seeds in the center of galactic structures .",
    "one possibility is the direct formation of a massive bh ( mbh ) from a collapsing gas cloud ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ; loeb & rasio 1994 ; eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; koushiappas , bullock & dekel 2004 ; begelman , volonteri & rees 2006 ) .",
    "the gas can condenses to form a central massive object .",
    "the mass of the seeds predicted by different models vary , but typically are in the range @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , the seeds of bhs can be associated with the remnants of the first generation of stars , formed out of zero metallicity gas .",
    "the first stars are believed to form at @xmath9 in halos which represent high@xmath10 peaks of the primordial density fie ld .",
    "the absence of metals might lead to a very top  heavy initial stellar mass function , and in particular to the production of very massive stars with masses @xmath11 ( carr , bond , & arnett 1984 ) .",
    "if very massive stars form above 260 @xmath12 , they would rapidly collapse to bhs with little mass loss ( fryer , woosley , & heger 2001 ) , i.e. , leaving behind seed bhs with masses @xmath13 ( madau & rees 2001 ) .",
    "the subsequent growth of bhs from these initial seeds has been investigated in the hierarchical framework , typically associating episodes of accretion to galaxy mergers ( haiman 2004 , yoo & miralda - escud 2004 , shapiro 2005 ; volonteri & rees 2005 , 2006 ; lapi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "only a few observational constraints are currently available .",
    "many are limited to the brightest sources , probing only the very bright end of the luminosity function of quasars at @xmath7 and therefore only the upper end of the massive black hole mass function ( fan et al .",
    "the observation of very luminous quasars , powered by billion solar masses bhs , at @xmath14 in the sdss survey ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) , implies that a substantial population of smaller accreting bhs must exist at earlier times .",
    "deeper but limited constraints have been provided for more typical agn , with @xmath15 2 orders of magnitude smaller mbhs , using deep x - ray observations ( e.g. , alexander et al .",
    "2001 ; barger et al . 2003b ; koekemoer et al . 2004",
    "; mainieri et al .",
    "however , these constraints lack the detail and depth required to understand and determine the global evolution of bh seeds and of the average mbh population at very high redshifts .",
    "accreting bhs are observed as x  ray emitters up to @xmath16 ( barger et al . 2003 , steffen et al .",
    "2006 ) , and there are no reasons to believe that higher redshift agn would be any different .",
    "the detection of very high redshift agn is one of the goals of future space missions .",
    "in particular , x  ray telescopes , such as the planned _ xeus _ and _ constellation  x _ , are expected to detect these sources even at @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , x  ray observatories can identify even heavily obscured agn activity , due to the penetrating nature of hard x - rays .",
    "additional , albeit less direct , limits on the early mbh population can already be placed by the requirement that the cumulative emission from the predicted high redshift sources does not saturate the observed unresolved x - ray background ( dijkstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ; salvaterra , haardt , ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "we show that future space - borne missions will be able to constrain different proposed models for the accretion history of mbhs at early times .",
    "we focus here on a specific model for mbh formation , which traces mbh seeds to the first generation of metal  free stars .",
    "we then compare how different accretion histories reflect onto the detectability of x  ray sources .",
    "the mass growth of the most massive bhs at high redshift must proceed very efficiently to explain the luminosity function of luminous quasars at @xmath17 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , e.g. fan et al .",
    "volonteri & rees ( 2005 ) explore the conditions which allow a sufficient growth of mbhs by @xmath18 under the assumption that accretion is triggered by major mergers . at such high redshift",
    "an investigation of evolution of the mbh population must take into account the dynamical evolution of mbhs .",
    "black hole mergers , in fact , can give a net negative contribution to the early black hole growth , due to gravitational effects which can kick bhs out of their host halos ( gravitational recoil , due to to the non - zero net linear momentum carried away by gravitational waves ) .",
    "adopting recent estimates for the recoil velocity ( baker et al .",
    "2006 ) , volonteri & rees ( 2005 ) find that if accretion is always limited by the eddington rate via a thin disc , the maximum radiative efficiency allowed to reproduce the lf at @xmath18 is @xmath19 ( corresponding to an upper limit to the mbh spin parameter of 0.8 ) .",
    "if , instead , high - redshift mbhs can accrete at super - critical rate during an early phase ( volonteri & rees 2005 , begelman , volonteri & rees 2006 ) , then reproducing the observed mbh mass values , is not an issue .",
    "the constraints from the lf at @xmath18 are still very weak , so either a model with a low @xmath20 or a model with supercritical accretion can not be ruled out based on these results only .    in a previous paper",
    "we have investigated how current observations can constrain the late accretion history of mbhs , at @xmath21 ( volonteri , salvaterra & haardt 2006 ) . in this paper",
    "we study by means of a detailed model of mbh assembly , the detectability of very high redshift agn both at x  ray and near - ir wavelengths by future missions .",
    "we discuss the contribution of these objects to the unresolved x  ray background ( in particular in the 0.52 kev band ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the role of an early population of agn in the reionization of the universe and their contribution to the uv background at high redshift .",

    "2 we describe briefly the merger tree model for the formation and evolution of mbh in the early universe .",

    "5 we present our results and discuss the role of future space mission in the observations of high redshift agn . in sect .",

    "we take @xmath28 at @xmath29 , which ensures that galaxies today hosted in halos with mass larger than @xmath30 are seeded with a mbh .",
    "the assumed threshold allows efficient formation of mbhs in the range of halo masses effectively probed by dynamical studies of mbh hosts in the local universe .    as a reference ,",
    "we adopt here a conservative model assuming eddington - limited accretion which is able to reproduce the bright end of the optical lf , as traced by observations in the sdss ( e.g. fan et al 2001 ) .",

    "2006 ) , the x  ray lfs are also quite similar . for the eddington ",
    "limited model the differential x  ray lf can be described by a simple power ",
    "law with power index @xmath171 , whereas for the super  critical accretion model @xmath172 . the open triangle in fig .  6 shows the estimated number density of @xmath173 agn as obtained by barger et al .",
    "( 2003b ) in the _ chandra _ deep field north .",
    "both models are in good agreement with the observed number density .",
    "although the two models share similar results at @xmath18 , the lf at higher redshift shows significant differences . for example , the number density of bright quasars at @xmath174 ( i.e. with luminosity in the rest - frame hard x  ray band in the range @xmath175 erg s@xmath3 , corresponding to mbhs with @xmath176 ) is @xmath177 mpc@xmath178 for the super  critical accretion model , whereas in the eddington ",
    "limited model this density decreases by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this result is confirmed by fig .  7 , where the solid line shows the redshift distribution of sources with fluxes above @xmath179 ( the planned spectroscopic flux limit of future x  ray missions ) in the observed soft x  ray band for the two models . a model that allows an early phase of super  critical accretion will have a redshift distribution of sources pushed towards higher redshifts with respect to the eddington",
    " limited model .",
    "dotted lines in fig .",
    "7 show the redshift distribution of sources with x  ray fluxes above @xmath179 that may also be observable with future near - ir facilities such as _ jwst _",
    "( i.e. , at the source detection limit of @xmath180 njy ) , showing that future x  ray observations along with optical ( near - ir ) identifications by the next generation of space and 30meter class telescopes might be able to discriminate the two different accretion histories . also shown in fig .",
    "7 is the redshift distribution of sources with fluxes above @xmath181 , easily achieved by deep _",
    "chandra _ observations ( e.g. , alexander et al .",
    "furthermore , we note here that at the planned soft x ",
    "ray photometric limit of _ xeus _ , only @xmath182% of observable sources is expected to lie at @xmath183 , if bhs growth is eddington  limited , whereas this fraction increases up to @xmath184% in case of super  critical accretion .",
    "it is unlikely that sufficient @xmath49 agn will be identified by the chandra deep field observations to discriminate between these two models .",
    "however , we can provide indirect constraints by considering the contribution that each make to the unresolved x - ray background .",
    "we find that the contribution to the unresolved xrb increases by a factor @xmath185 : the predicted unresolved background from sources at @xmath72 is @xmath186 in the 0.52 kev band , and @xmath187 in the 28 kev band .",
    "results are summarized in table  1 . as a net result ,",
    "once that the contribute to the unresolved xrb of sources at @xmath21 is considered , rapid  growth model saturates the observed unaccounted background . note that , according to worsley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , most of the unaccounted 28 kev xrb actually lies at energies @xmath188 kev , strengthening our conclusions .    we also find that the x  ray background is saturated in a model in which massive seeds form late , as in koushiappas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in this model seed mbh form from the low angular momentum tail of material in halos with efficient gas cooling . in first approximation , the koushiappas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model indicates that seed mbh form in halos with mass above the threshold @xmath189 , with a mass @xmath190 .",
    "the largest seed mass allows for a less efficient accretion , in particular , we have assumed that the accretion rate is eddington  limited , and the maximum radiative efficiency is 20% ( gammie et al 2004 ) .",
    "also in the late formation scenario , the unresolved xrb is saturated , being @xmath191 in the 0.52 kev band , and @xmath192 in the 28 kev band .",
    "xrb saturation could be a problem for such models , as a substantial contribution to the xrb from low ",
    "redshift ( i.e. @xmath21 ) , unresolved faint sources ( volonteri , salvaterra & haardt 2006 ) and/or galaxies ( bauer et al .",
    "2004 ) can not be excluded .",

    "in this paper we have assessed , using monte carlo simulations of dm halo merger history coupled with semi  analytical recipes for the assembly of mbhs within galaxy spheroids ( volonteri et al .",
    "2003 ) , the possibility of constraining the agn population at @xmath72 with currently available and planned space borne missions . in particular , we have considered ultra  deep x  ray and near - ir surveys .",
    "we claim that , among the unresolved sources in _ chandra _ deep fields , few of them are agn at @xmath72 , whose bh masses are @xmath194 , while in the near - ir , an are three times larger than the hudf area is required in order to detect just one of these high  z sources .",
    "future x  ray missions , such as _ xeus _ , and near - ir facilities such as _ jwst _ , will have the technical capabilities to detect accreting mbhs at @xmath72 down to a mass limit as low as @xmath153 . since _ jwst _",
    "observations will reveal only the un  absorbed agn population , x  ray deep surveys are definitely the best tool suited for investigation of the early stages of mbh assembly . in particular , the next generation of x  ray telescopes might detect as many as @xmath110 sources / deg@xmath107 at their photometric sensitivity limits in the 0.52 kev band .",
    "further constraints on the population of high redshift agn will be provided by future 21 cm experiments like lofar ( rhook & haehnelt 2006 ) .",
    "we have shown that our predicted population of high redshift agn would account for a significant fraction of the unresolved xrb ( 0.58 kev ) .",
    "almost 5% of the measured xrb ( or @xmath5% of the unresolved one ) should come from sources at @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , in our model of @xmath49 agn , the major contribution actually comes from sources at @xmath135 , with fluxes @xmath195 , i.e. that can not be detected even by the next generation of x  ray telescopes ; we find that at least 3 - 4% of the measured xrb should remain unresolved even after _",
    "observations become available .",
    "these constraints become much more severe for a model in which super  critical accretion is allowed in the early stages of the mbh growth ( volonteri & rees 2005 ) .",
    "the model reproduces well the observational constraints at @xmath18 ( optical and x  ray lfs ) , and predicts a more extended tail of sources observable at @xmath196 .",
    "however , we find that in the rapid  growth model , the predicted xrb is three times higher than in the eddington  limited accretion model , saturating the unresolved fraction of the xrb in both the 0.52 kev and 28 kev energy bands . since faint sources at @xmath21 are expected to contribute substantially to the unaccounted xrb ( bauer et al .",
    "2004 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2006 ) , this result suggests that the occurrence and effectivity of super - critical accretion should be investigated in much more detail .",
    "in particular , super ",
    "eddington accretion could be much less efficient in few@xmath10 peaks halos , due to the gas evacuation from the ionizing radiation emitted by the mbh seed pop iii star progenitor ( johnson & bromm 2006 ) .",
    "eddington accretion consequently is biased towards the highest density peaks , which experience the largest number of mergers with halos containing pristine gas to replenish the gas reservoir .",
    "models in which seeds are much more massive than pop iii star remnants , as in koushiappas et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , saturate the unresolved fraction of the xrb in both the 0.52 kev and 28 kev energy bands as well .",
    "we note here that different models for mbh seed formation , although predicting rather large bh masses , can have a lower formation efficiency , which can ease the constraints given by the xrb ( see eisenstein & loeb 1995 , and begelman , volonteri & rees 2006 ) .",
    "our constraints on theoretical models are conservative , as we adopted the largest value of the unresolved xrb available in literature .",
    "finally , we have computed the evolution of the uv background produced by the modeled population of high redshift agn . later than @xmath152 ,",
    "the ionizing intensity is dominated by relatively massive bhs , @xmath197 , while lighter bhs contribute mostly at earlier epochs .",
    "the uv background from agn rapidly declines at @xmath116 .",
    "we compute the contribution of these sources to the reionization of the universe , showing that agn alone can provide enough ionizing photons only in the ( improbable ) case of an almost completely homogeneous inter  galactic medium .",
    "nevertheless , for a more clumpy medium , the agn contribution to the ionizing background is never negligible .",
    "we note that high redshift agn can not contribute significantly to the near - ir background .",
