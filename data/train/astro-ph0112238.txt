    "proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) are objects in transition between the agb stage and planetary nebula ( pn ) stage in stellar evolution ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "ppne are astrophysical objects not only important in studying the mass - loss from post - agb stars and the formation of pne , but also are considered to related to some of enigmatic high - latitude luminous yellow variables , such as rv tau stars and uu her stars ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "tmzv429 ( = gsc 6554.559 ) is a variable star discovered by takamizawa @xcite the j2000.0 coordinates are 080240.71 , @xmath12404424 . @xcite reported small amplitude variations with a total photographic range of variability of 11.712.2 .",
    "@xcite originally suspected that this star is an semiregular variable .",
    "we discovered that this variable star , inconspicuous at the time of the variability announcement , is identified with a conspicuously mass - losing central star of a ppn , iras 08005 - 2356 .",

    "the magnitudes were determined by comparison with non - red gsc stars , whose zero - point offset from tycho-2 @xmath2 magnitudes have been estimated to be + 0.5 mag .",
    "this offset is confirmed by comparison with a single point @xmath2-band ccd measurement ( kiyota , private communication ) . since",
    "a constant offset does not affect the confirmation of the variability and period analysis , we use the original measurements in the following analysis .",

    "we noticed that tmzv429 is identified with the ppn with a rapid mass - loss , iras 08005 - 2356 @xcite .",
    "the object is also identified with an infrared source , msx5c g242.3642 + 03.5822 @xcite .",
    "the optical spectral classification by @xcite is a late f - supergiant with prominent hydrogen emission lines .",
    "together with takamizawa s discovery of optical variability , the object seems to be classified as an high luminosity yellow supergiant variable ( srd - type in the general catalogue of variable stars ) .",
    "we analyzed the original discovery data by @xcite using the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method @xcite .",
    "the result of period analysis are shown in figure [ fig : per ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the period search was done for periods between 10 and 100 d. the range was limited mainly due to the data sampling , but covers most frequently met periods in low - mass , high luminosity , srd - type variables .",
    "the strongest period between 10 and 100 d is 28.9 d. the period probably needs be treated with caution , because the period is close to the lunar month , and because of the possible intrinsic irregularity in such a variable .",
    "a rapid fading by 0.4 mag between jd 2450378 and 2450426 , however , supports the existence of short - period variation with a period less than @xmath0100 d.    the folded light curve by this period is shown in figure [ fig : per ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this result shows that the variability discovered by takamizawa can be expressed by oscillations with a single , relatively short period .",
    "although the possibility of a longer period can not be completely disregarded , the raw data ( table [ tab : obs ] ) suggest a short - period variation , rather than a period of hundreds of days to years .",
    "@xcite reported some line features are similar to @xmath5 cas .",
    "the presently discovered variation , however , is not consistent with variations with a much longer period ( @xmath0300 d ) as in massive @xmath5 cas - like variables .",
    "the star should be thereby regarded as a low - mass , post - agb pulsator ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is consistent with the evolutionary stage @xcite inferred from optical spectroscopy and iras observations .    although the number of observations is still limited , and the present analysis unavoidably suffers from a uncertainty , the present result suggests the existence of a low - amplitude ( @xmath00.5 mag ) , relatively short - period pulsations in tmzv429 , which are analogous to variations observed in some stellar components of other ppne and in high galactic luminous yellow variables , such as rv tau stars and uu her stars .",
    "@xcite suggested that the evolutionary time scale of this object is quite short ( @xmath0150 yrs ) .",
    "tmzv429 is thus one of rare objects caught in the rapid course of ppn evolution , and shows one of the most striking mass - loss features among variable stars in the ppn stage .",
