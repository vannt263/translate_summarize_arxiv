    "the human eye is distinguished from commercially available electronic cameras by virtue of having much better resolution in the fovea near the optical axis .",
    "the eccentricity of the retina , which produces a large field of view and high acuity at the fovea , causes the human visual system to have quick jerky eye movements - i.e. , saccades .",
    "it was shown that an artificial visual system equipped with saccades could reduce the number of processing units required for pattern recognition @xcite and could greatly simplify the calculations in low - level vision systems @xcite .",
    "the saccades involve two subtasks ; i.e. , a location task and an identification task .",
    "the location task fixates the location of a pattern in a wide field of view using _ a priori knowledge of the pattern class of interest . on the other hand",
    ", the identification task determines the class of a pattern under the assumption that the location of the pattern can be fixated .",
    "these subtasks are therefore cooperative .",
    "recently , hopfield and his colleagues have shown that a symmetric interconnected neural network ( a hopfield neural network ) can perform error corrections in associative retrieval @xcite and lead to appropriate solutions in optimization problems @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we treat the saccades as the optimization problem and apply the hopfield network to the emulation of saccades .",
    "computer simulation confirms that the network performs these subtasks cooperatively .",
    "it also suggests that the network is applicable to shift - invariant pattern recognition . _",
    "the network ( shown in fig.[figure01 ] ) comprises three blocks of neurons called the saccades ( s ) block , hidden ( h ) block , and output(o ) block , respectively .",
    "its energy function is defined as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a gaze position , @xmath4 a pixel image of an input pattern , @xmath5 a window function , @xmath6 and activity of the @xmath7th neuron of @xmath8 block , @xmath9 the output of the @xmath7th neuron of @xmath8 block ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 the @xmath12th template embedded in the weights between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 blocks , @xmath15 positive constants .",
    "the @xmath16 block is a matrix representation of the location of an input pattern relative to a gaze position represented as the @xmath17th neuron .",
    "the most - activated neuron in the @xmath14 block indicates the class of the input pattern whose location would be represented by the @xmath16 block .",
    "the location and identification tasks are obtained by minimizing the first and second terms in the energy function , respectively .",
    "the third and fourth terms represent winner - take - all constraints in the @xmath16 and @xmath14 blocks , respectively .",
    "a gaze position is updated by the following rule : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an index of the most - activated neuron in the @xmath16 block . when the gaze position is unchanged by the updating rule , the tasks are complete .     and @xmath14 block .",
    "fully interconnected between the @xmath16 and @xmath13 block and between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 block . ]",
    "the first simulation confirmed that the network can perform cooperative subtasks in the saccades .",
    "positive constants in the energy function and the number of neurons of each block were chosen to be @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , respectively . four templates ( @xmath27 binary - valued pixels ) are depicted in fig.[figure02 ] .",
    "the stable states of the network are illustrated in fig.[figure03](a)-(d ) , where one side of each square represents an output level of the corresponding neuron , an empty circle in @xmath4 a gaze position , and a directed line in the s block a saccadic vector .",
    "it is also seen that the activation pattern of the @xmath28 block resembles the template of the class of the target pattern .",
    "the network was next applied to shift - invariant pattern recognition .",
    "positive constants in the energy function and the number of neurons of each block were chosen to be @xmath29 , @xmath21 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , respectively . ten templates ( @xmath35 binary - valued pixels )",
    "are depicted in fig.[figure04 ] . in the experiment ,",
    "160 input patterns shifted in any direction by one pixel and deformed by no more than eight hits ( hamming distance ) , including the patterns shown in fig.[figure05 ] , were recognized perfectly .",
    "the behavior of the network is illustrated in fig.[figure06 ] .",
    "figure [ figure06](a ) and ( b ) show the stable states before and after a saccade by one pixel to the upper left , respectively .",
    "we can see the identification task was completed by the saccade that resulted from the location task .",
    "a hopfield neural network for saccades has been proposed .",
    "computer simulations confirmed that the network performs the location and the identification tasks in a cooperative fashion .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the network can be applied to shift - invariant pattern recognition . since",
    "out network is a standard hopfield - type neural network , it is suitable for vlsi and optical implementations and therefore can speed up saccadic tasks and shift - invariant pattern recognition significantly .     used in the first simulation . ]",
    "used in the second simulation . ]",
