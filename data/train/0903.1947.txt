    "one of the recent proposals to solve the cosmological constant problem in cosmology is provided by string theory . by dimensional reduction from m - theory to 3 + 1 dimensions , vacua of the effective theory are classified by means of a big number of quantized fluxes leading to an enormous amount of metastable vacua , the bousso - polchinski ( bp ) landscape @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant problem , namely the smallness of the observed vacuum energy density in the universe @xcite , can be solved by the presence in this model of a huge number of states of very small , positive cosmological constant , together with a dynamical mechanism given by eternal inflation @xcite which allows the system to visit all the vacua .",
    "an anthropic selection is then advocated to explain the smallness of the observed cosmological constant @xcite .    in order to quantify this selection a counting of accesible states in the landscape is needed .",
    "the simplest one is the bousso - polchinski count , which computes the volume of a spherical shell of small thickness in flux space and divides it by the volume of a cell .",
    "we will now briefly review this argument ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a vacuum of the bp landscape is a node in a @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath1 generated by @xmath0 charges @xmath2 determined by the sizes of the three - cycles in the compactification manifold .",
    "the lattice @xmath1 is @xmath3 the @xmath4-th coordinate of a point in the lattice is an integer multiple of the charge @xmath5 , and therefore a vacuum is characterized by the integer @xmath0-tuple @xmath6 .    a _ fundamental cell _ ( also called _ _ voronoi cell _ _ in a discrete set @xmath7 of a metric space @xmath8 is the set of points of @xmath8 which are closer to @xmath9 than to any other point of @xmath7 . ] )",
    "@xmath10 around a node @xmath11 in a lattice @xmath1 is the subset of @xmath12 which contains the points which are closer to @xmath11 than to any other node of @xmath1 .",
    "thanks to the discrete translational symmetry of our lattice ( [ eq : c1 ] ) , all fundamental cells in @xmath1 are translates of the fundamental cell around the origin @xmath13 , which we can parametrize in cartesian coordinates as a product of symmetric intervals @xmath14\\,.\\ ] ] the cosmological constant of vacuum @xmath11 in the bp model is . ]",
    "@xmath15 in ( [ eq : c3 ] ) , @xmath16 is an _ a priori _ cosmological constant or order @xmath17 .",
    "each value of @xmath18 defines a spherical ball on the @xmath0-dimensional flux space of radius @xmath19 .",
    "we call this ball @xmath20 .",
    "we take small values of the charges @xmath5 ( natural values expected by bp are of order @xmath21 ) in such a way that the ball can contain a huge number of fundamental cells .",
    "the number of states in the weinberg window , that is the range of values of the cosmological constant allowing the formation of structures ( like galaxies ) needed for the formation of life as we know it @xcite , is obtained by computing the volume of a thin spherical shell in flux space ( the realization in the bp landscape of the weinberg window ) divided by the volume of a cell in the lattice : @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( we will call it henceforth @xmath24 ) , and the volume of the @xmath25 dimensional sphere is @xmath26 this method can be naively expected to yield a good estimate when the linear dimensions of the cell are small when compared to the thickness of the shell ; but this condition is not satisfied in the bp landscape . nevertheless , the result of this counting formula is very good when compared to actual numerical experiments . in the following , we will re - derive the bp count , systematic improvements and a condition of validity .",
    "our proposal is based on the following kinds of states one may encounter near the null cosmological constant surface in flux space :    * * boundary * ( or * penultimate * after bousso and yang @xcite ) are those states in which a brown - teitelboim @xcite decay chain can end before jumping into the negative cosmological constant sea .",
    "so we define a boundary state as one having * * positive cosmological constant , and * * at least one neighbor of negative cosmological constant . * * secant * states have the property that their voronoi cells in flux space have non - empty intersection with the null cosmological constant surface in flux space .",
    "note that a secant state may have negative cosmological constant .",
    "these two categories are not equivalent ; a boundary state may not be secant if it is far enough from the null cosmological constant surface , and a secant state may not be boundary if it has negative cosmological constant .",
    "so we are interested mainly in the states which are both secant * and * boundary , because all the states in the weinberg window are in this category",
    ".    our strategy will be as follows .",
    "we will count the states in the weinberg window using the secant states instead of the boundary states .",
    "we approximate the exact count using the poisson summation formula in section [ sec : n_s ] .",
    "the same technique is used to obtain a distribution of values of the cosmological constant and the number of states in the weinberg window in section [ sec : n_ww ] .",
    "our results yield the bp count as the lowest order approximation as well as systematic improvements . in section",
    "[ sec : n_b ] we sketch the difficulties encountered while extending the method to the boundary states .",
    "finally , we summarize the conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "this work is a continuation of the counting method introduced in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath27 is a secant state of the lattice @xmath28 , the @xmath29 sphere intersects its voronoi cell .",
    "the line which links the origin with @xmath30 hits the sphere in a single point , @xmath31 .",
    "the directions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the same , @xmath32 , and their norms are @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the parameter @xmath35 is simply the distance between the sphere and @xmath30 ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) , and has a close relation with the cosmological constant : @xmath36 in particular , @xmath37 is positive if and only if @xmath35 is positive , and @xmath29 if and only if @xmath38 .     bp model along with the definition of the @xmath35 and @xmath39 parameters . ]",
    "note that the pair @xmath40 determines the tangent hyperplane on the @xmath29 sphere at @xmath31 , and therefore can be identified with this hyperplane @xmath41 .",
    "note that @xmath42 intersects the voronoi cell of @xmath30 , but @xmath31 is not necessarily inside the cell .",
    "the set of possible @xmath31 points , each corresponding to a secant hyperplane , can be specified by computing the maximum value which @xmath35 can have for a fixed direction @xmath39 .",
    "we will call this quantity @xmath43 , which is given by the distance of the most distant secant hyperplane @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the unique corner out of @xmath46 which belongs to the same @xmath0-quadrant as @xmath39 , and the @xmath47 are signs @xmath48 , indeed the same signs of the components of @xmath39 .",
    "we find @xmath49 in ( [ eq : c8 ] ) , @xmath50 .",
    "note that the function @xmath51 defines a surface in flux space which contains the possible @xmath31 points , equivalently , the possible secant hyperplanes .",
    "we call the interior of this surface the _ ( secant ) hyperplane space _ associated to the cell , @xmath52 , and a hyperplane @xmath41 is in @xmath52 if and only if @xmath53 .",
    "if we take all secant states of a given lattice and we gather all their cells into one , the @xmath31 points seem to be randomly distributed inside @xmath52 ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "so our suggestion is to provide an explicit form for the probability measure which governs this random distribution .",
    "we call the choosing of a particular measure @xmath54 in @xmath52 a _ random hyperplane model _ ( rhm ) .     in a @xmath55 bp landscape .",
    "each dot is a @xmath31 point of a secant state .",
    "the shaded region is the first quadrant of the cell @xmath56 , and all dots lie inside the blue contour , which is the ( first quadrant ) boundary of hyperplane space @xmath52 . ]    in our previous work @xcite we chose the uniform probability measure , and we will justify this assumption as an approximation in section [ sec : n_ww ] .",
    "we start using an exact expression for the number of secant states of positive cosmological constant .",
    "we call this number @xmath57 . for each secant state @xmath30 , we denote by @xmath58 and @xmath59 the parameters of its associated secant hyperplane , being simply @xmath60 using the restriction @xmath53 and the indicator function @xmath61 of an interval @xmath62 ( which is 1 if @xmath63 and 0 otherwise ) , we can write @xmath64}[\\rho(\\lambda)]\\,.\\ ] ] direct use of ( [ eq : c10 ] ) is unfeasible ; we would have to compile all secant states to count them . but",

    "the lowest order approximation in ( [ eq : c12 ] ) yields the following formula for the number of positive @xmath37 secant states : @xmath74 we can expect this to be an accurate approximation from the following qualitative argument .",
    "the function @xmath67 is supported at a compact domain whose extent is proportional to some average charge @xmath75 times a @xmath0-dependent constant .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath76 will be then concentrated at a domain of dimensions proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "but the spacings between neighboring nodes of the dual lattice are the inverses of the charges , and thus only a few of these nodes will enter the domain with significant amplitude .    in this approximation , we can rewrite eq .",

    "the worst case will occur when all charges are equal ( let @xmath131 be their common value ) , and then we must demand that @xmath132 is very far from the gaussian regime of the function @xmath121 , that is , @xmath133 where the number @xmath134 is @xmath0-dependent . for @xmath55 ( @xmath135 ) , taking @xmath136 as a reference amplitude for a relative error of @xmath137 , we need a value of @xmath138 large enough to be in the asymptotic regime of the bessel function , so we have @xmath139 which implies @xmath140 from ( [ eq : c36 ] ) , but for @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) the value @xmath136 is in the gaussian regime , and we have @xmath143 which implies @xmath144 .",
    "we see that the requirements in the charges are not too restrictive so that the bousso - polchinki count ( [ eq : c29 ] ) can be reasonably accurate .",
    "we can also expect the subsequent corrections to be small when compared to the first one because of the cancellations in the sum of bessel functions .",
    "if we want to use boundary states to count the low-@xmath37 states , we must find a condition satisfied by them which is analogous to @xmath145 for the secant states .",
    "a boundary state has positive @xmath37 but some neighbors ( possibly only one ) of negative @xmath37 , which means that the @xmath29 sphere must cut the segment joining both states .",

    "but we can reformulate the condition of a boundary state as being secant with respect to this cell instead of its voronoi cell .",
    "note that the @xmath29 surface intersecting a @xmath0-rhombus will have its @xmath35 and @xmath39 parameters defined , so the boundary condition is again @xmath145 for a different to this function in this section ; this should not lead the reader to confusion . ]",

    "the value of @xmath154 and @xmath155 are chosen in the following way .",
    "let @xmath156 be the normal unit vector to the face of the @xmath0-rhombus in the first ( all positive components ) @xmath0-quadrant , @xmath157 : @xmath158 point @xmath156 decomposes @xmath157 in the following @xmath0 regions : @xmath159 now , let us move @xmath39 to @xmath157 by removing the signs : @xmath160 .",

    "that equation ( [ eq : c24 ] ) does not involve @xmath147 because of the smallness of the shell width , and therefore the number @xmath174 computed in section [ sec : n_ww ] remains unchanged .",
    "only a difference must be stressed in this regard : the shell width must be smaller than the minimum distance @xmath175 , which now depends on @xmath0 .",
    "it is simply the distance to the cell center of one of its faces .",
    "the face at @xmath157 has equation @xmath176 or @xmath177 , so we have the condition @xmath178^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }    = \\frac{\\widetilde{q}}{\\sqrt{j } }    \\gg \\rho_a = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{ww}}}{r}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath179 is a `` square - harmonic '' average of the charges .",
    "note that this condition is met for natural values of the charges and dimension @xmath0 , so that considering secant or boundary states may change the probability distribution of @xmath37 in equation ( [ eq : c25 ] ) but it has no effect on the number of states in the weinberg window .",
    "we have developed a general method for counting low - lying states in the bousso - polchinki landscape with the help of the poisson summation formula without any statistical validation of the assumptions made .",
    "this approach provides a firm foundation of the random hyperplane model previously used by the authors .",
    "it also allows us to derive validity conditions as well as systematic improvements , and can be used in different problems which can be formulated on a lattice in flux space .",
    "furthermore , the validity condition ( [ eq:45 ] ) relates an experimental quantity ( the cosmological constant ) to a microscopic one ( an average charge ) .",
    "we believe that this relation can be pursued in this context ."
