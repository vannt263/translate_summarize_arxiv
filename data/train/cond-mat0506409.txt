    "<S> the correlated @xmath0 sulphide bavs@xmath1 undergoes a sequence of three symmetry breaking transitions which are reflected in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility , and its anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a microscopic model based on the coexistence of wide band @xmath2 and localized @xmath3 @xmath4-electrons , and give the classification of the order parameters under the double space group and time reversal symmetries . allowing for the relativistic spin  orbit coupling , the @xmath4-shell multipoles acquire a mixed spin  orbital character . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that orbital ordering is accompanied by a change in the susceptibility anisotropy .    and    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , orbital order , magnetic anisotropy , spin - orbit coupling 71.27.+a ; 71.10.fd ; 71.70.ej ; 75.10.dg ; 75.30.et    bavs@xmath1 can be regarded as a @xmath4-electron system with hidden order , or perhaps with several hidden orders . </S>",
    "<S> its metal  insulator transition ( mit ) has been known for over 25 years @xcite , and it was long supposed to be an example of a mott transition without symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> no magnetic ordering accompanies the mit and it was not discovered until 2002 that there is a structural change : the unit cell is doubled along the trigonal axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structural order parameter could be used to construct a landau theory , and this would be sufficient to account for the fact that the mit remains a second order transition in a wide range of pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we would like to consider bavs@xmath1 as a correlated electron system , and find electronic ( as well as structural ) order parameters for its phases . a systematic search for order parameters </S>",
    "<S> is based on symmetry classification .    </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature symmetry group of bavs@xmath1 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cell contains two v sites along the @xmath8 axis , so the cell doubling mentioned previously means that the @xmath9 unit cell contains four v atoms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry is lowered from @xmath10 by a sequence of three ordering transitions : a hexagonal - to - orthorombic transition at @xmath11k , the mit at @xmath12k ( breaking translational symmetry ) and finally , time reversal invariance is broken at @xmath13k . certainly there is an antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic dipoles but it is probably accompanied by the ordering of composite spin  orbital octupoles .    </S>",
    "<S> bavs@xmath1 is a @xmath14 system . in the high-@xmath15 hexagonal phase , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 level is split into a @xmath2 singlet , and an @xmath3 doublet of orbitals @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a long - standing problem @xcite whether only @xmath3 states are occupied , or both @xmath2 and @xmath3 levels are important . </S>",
    "<S> the current understanding emerging from arpes experiments @xcite and dmft calculations @xcite is that @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons are present in roughly equal proportions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 states form a wide band , while @xmath3 electrons carry localized ( dipole , quadrupole , and arguably octupole ) moments .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the orbital degrees of freedom of the @xmath3 electrons play an important role is shown by the temperature dependence of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the source of anisotropy is that both @xmath16 and trigonal @xmath3 electrons have unquenched orbital moment , and thus there is a first - order effect from the relativistic spin  orbit coupling ( soc ) . for vanadium compounds , </S>",
    "<S> the soc is substantial ( @xmath19ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> susceptibility anisotropy measured by @xmath20 begins to deviate from 0 at about 250k , reaches -.07 at 70k , and + 0.2 at low @xmath15 ( @xmath21 is the trigonal axis , @xmath22 one of the orthorombic axes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions at @xmath23 and @xmath24 are marked by cusp - like anomalies of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> published results allow a comparison between @xmath26 and @xmath27 only , but we predict further anisotropy within the @xmath22@xmath28 plane .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard order parameter of the 250k transition is purely structural : it is the change in the @xmath29 ratio @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lifting the degeneracy of the @xmath3 level causes orbital polarization @xcite which we measure by the expectation value of the pseudospin @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the spin . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse components @xmath32 , @xmath33 of the orbital pseudospin are analogously defined . </S>",
    "<S> the time - reversal - odd component is @xmath34 , the orbital momentum along the trigonal axis .    </S>",
    "<S> the evidence from the susceptibility anisotropy gives sufficient reason to assert that the orthorombic splitting must be modest and therefore the orbital degree of freedom @xmath35 remains important at all @xmath15 s .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed a symmetry analysis and preliminary mean field calculations for two cases : 1 ) considering a single v site as a unit , and 2 ) for the two - v - atom unit cell of the high-@xmath15 structure of bavs@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the details will be given elsewhere @xcite ; here we restrict ourselves to simple illustrative arguments .    </S>",
    "<S> a single @xmath16 electron in external fields can be described by @xmath36 where the first term is the soc , the second the trigonal field , the third is a quadrupolar mean field corresponding to the ordering of @xmath37 and the last is the zeeman term . </S>",
    "<S> we arbitrarily chose one member of quadrupolar order parameter doublet @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath39 induces the mixed spin  </S>",
    "<S> orbital quadrupole @xmath40 the magnetic field effects are :    1 .   for @xmath41 , in addition to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , also @xmath44 and @xmath45 are induced . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .    for @xmath46 , in addition to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , also @xmath42 and @xmath43 are induced . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 induces only @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> analogous results are found for other kinds of orbital order . in principle , we can hope to identify the type of orbital order from finding which non - diagonal elements of the susceptibility tensor have non - zero values .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the cubic @xmath3 , the trigonal @xmath3 doublet carries both dipoles and octupoles . the argument given above is equivalent to stating that the spin  </S>",
    "<S> orbital octupole @xmath50 has the same symmetry as @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this may be relevant for the description of the nature of ferromagnetism of bavse@xmath1 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> going over to the case of the two - atomic unit cell , we have to worry about the spatial distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath2 electrons . to a good approximation </S>",
    "<S> , there is one localized @xmath3 electron per two v atoms , i.e. , one @xmath3 electron in each high-@xmath15 unit cell containing the sites v1 and v2 . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a kondo - necklace - type @xcite spin - pseudospin model in which all ordering degrees of freedom are ascribed to @xmath3 electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the spin ( @xmath31 ) and orbital pseudospin ( @xmath35 ) degrees of freedom , we have a second pseudospin @xmath51 describing the position of the @xmath3 electron in the unit cell ( @xmath52 for v1 , @xmath53 for v2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 8-dimensional local hilbert space supports @xmath54 local order parameters which we classified under the symmetry @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> we carried out mean field calculations in the @xmath31@xmath35@xmath51 model , assuming a sequence of ferro-@xmath35 and antiferro-@xmath51 ordering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternating order of the @xmath55 pseudospins amounts to the appearance of a four - v - atom supercell with the @xmath2@xmath3@xmath3@xmath2 character . </S>",
    "<S> superexchange gives singlet binding at the @xmath3@xmath3 centers of the tetramers , explaining the observed spin gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin correlations are drastically reduced in the para-@xmath51 phase , though orbital order persists . </S>"
