    "<S> we describe a variational calculation for the problem of screening of a point charge in a layered correlated metal close to the mott transition where the screening is non - linear due to the proximity to the incompressible insulating state . this analysis can robustly account for locally incompressible regions induced by external charge and gives further insights , such as overscreening in the nearest nearby metallic layers while preserving overall charge neutrality .    </S>",
    "<S> correlated metals can exhibit a large variation of electronic compressibility for small changes in the electron density . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> a local charge impurity , such as muon or dopant interstitial , may lead to a significant displacement of charge and drive the system to a local insulating ( incompressible ) state . </S>",
    "<S> such non - linear screening is further complicated by the layered structure of the interesting correlated metals , such as the cuprates , since an additional length scale ( the layer spacing ) is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> these aspects of the screening of a point charge in a correlated metal can be analyzed within a variational scheme.@xcite though by no means exhaustive , the variational analysis allows for a phenomenological account of microscopic aspects of the physics of correlated metals which are still poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> the current interest into the problem of electrostatic screening in layered correlated metals has been induced by recent muon spin relaxation experiments in underdoped metallic cuprates.@xcite    electrostatic screening in a layered metal can be analyzed starting with a model of an equidistant stack of metallic planes at @xmath0 separated by a dielectric medium . </S>",
    "<S> an external charge is placed between the two planes , at @xmath1 , at position @xmath2 above the center . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential @xmath3 is determined by screening charges @xmath4 on the metallic planes via the poisson equation @xmath5_{r , z_n}\\!\\!=\\!\\ ! </S>",

    "<S> @xmath7 is the electrostatic potential of the external charge . </S>",
    "<S> going to planar momentum variable , @xmath8 , via @xmath9 we write @xmath10 due to rotational symmetry the planar momentum @xmath8 enters only via @xmath11 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is the potential of an external charge . </S>",
    "<S> rewrite it in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is laplacian operator on a finite stack of metallic planes defined as a matrix inverse of @xmath15 . for a finite stack of @xmath16 planes </S>",
    "<S> it is a tri - diagonal matrix of the form , @xmath17{5 } \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coulomb ] ) can be obtained as a condition for stationarity of the functional @xmath20 with @xmath21 as an independent variable . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the screening charge density is defined via the second term by @xmath23 . for a metallic plane characterized by linear compressibility </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the inverse screening length of the two - dimensional metal@xcite and @xmath26 the form of @xmath27 for non - linear screening will be discussed later . </S>",
    "<S> we will take the simple view that for small displaced charge the metallic plane has a large and fixed charge compressibility and therefore the screening is linear . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the situation where most of the screening of external charge is done by the two nearest planes , @xmath28 , the screening charge in the rest of metallic planes is small and therefore can be accounted within linear screening regime . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation one has to consider the effects of non - linear screening in the two nearest metallic planes only .      to discuss the non - linear screening </S>",
    "<S> , we need to specify the compressibility part of the functional , @xmath27 , and variational functions . </S>",
    "<S> we take a simple model in which the non - linear compressibility in the metallic plane is a step function : when local screening charge density exceeds a certain threshold , @xmath68 , the metallic layer goes over into a local insulating ( incompressible ) state , @xmath69 . in the cuprates , for instance </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath70 holes per unit cell around optimal doping . in the absence of external charge , </S>",
    "<S> the local hole density is determined by chemical doping , @xmath71 . at high enough doping the copper - oxide plane is metallic and it is characterized by linear electrostatic response , @xmath72 . we note that when the threshold density @xmath68 is small a significant fraction of the electric field may leak to the next plane , @xmath73 , and be strong enough for it to reach the threshold density as well , which will invalidate our assumption of all other planes being in the linear screening regime . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : twoplanes ] ) to allow non - linear screening in more than two nearest metallic planes is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> since the local charge density is defined via @xmath27 , this model requires @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of non - linear compressibility is that the screening charge is pushed out of the immediate vicinity of the external charge ( when compared with the screening in the linear case ) , i.e. , the screening cloud is larger . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that this does not affect the screening cloud at large distances where displaced charge is small and the screening is linear . </S>",
    "<S> this observation leads to the choice of our variational function : the electrostatic potential for a screening of a point charge in a non - linear metal is modelled with a screening potential in a linear metal due to a `` smeared '' , finite size , external charge . </S>",
    "<S> such variational function can be constructed starting with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : linearscreening ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that the charge is only distributed in the direction parallel to the plane with charge density @xmath79 , i.e. , the variational function is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : linearscreening ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest choice is a constant charge density over a disk of radius @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a step function . </S>",
    "<S> for the situation discussed below a non - uniform distribution @xmath85 proves to be better . </S>",
    "<S> for the non - linear screening the density is not simply related ( not proportional ) to the local screening potential , thus @xmath86 is an independent variational parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the interpolating property of our choice of variational function is that in the linear screening case it is an exact screening potential with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .     in a layered metal . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the gray line is the non - linear screening density profile of an external charge in the center , @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue and red squares represent the screening density in the two planes for asymmetric position of an external charge , @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid red / blue lines show the linear screening density profile for the same geometry in the upper and lower metallic planes . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss screening of an external positive charge , @xmath93 , in a layered metal which geometry which roughly corresponds to lsco cuprates , presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the planar distance is in units of planar unit cell size , @xmath94 , and the density is given in units of charge per planar unit cell . for a symmetric position of the external charge , </S>",
    "<S> the insulating region has a radius of @xmath95 , and it contains about @xmath96 charge ( in units of @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the for large values of linear compressibility ( @xmath97 ) the density outside the insulating region decays rather slowly , at distances of about inter - plane distance , @xmath98 , and the charge density decrease to a half of its value in insulating region at about @xmath99 from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the total charge in each plane is @xmath100 , ( @xmath101 for linear screening in the same geometry ) . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers support our assumption that all other metallic planes are in the linear screening regime . </S>",
    "<S> the situation changes slightly if we shift the external charge away from the symmetric position , @xmath92 , which more closely reflects the muon site in the lsco lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the area of the insulating region in both planes increases in this asymmetric situation , @xmath102 in one plane and @xmath103 in the other . </S>",
    "<S> the total screening charge in each plane is , @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 for linear screening in the same geometry ) . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the symmetric external charge position , in this asymmetric situation the plane which is closer to the external charge is in the locally insulating state over a larger area and therefore , the effective , partially screened charge seen by the other , more distant plane , is also larger . </S>",
    "<S> the total charge of the two planes , @xmath108 , is greater than one , i.e. , in this geometry the non - linear screening leads to an overscreening of the external charge in the two nearest metallic planes . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated screening charge in the infinite stack planes remains equal to the external charge .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a minimal variational framework for the analysis of screening of a point charge in correlated layered metals such as cuprates in the metallic doping range . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to the screening of the muon in the lsco cuprates , the calculation supports an earlier qualitative discussion in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ @xcite ] . the method presented here </S>",
    "<S> may be used to study the charge distribution , rectification , transistor action and other surface effects between weakly doped mott insulators and metals . </S>"
