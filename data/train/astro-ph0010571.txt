    "the recent boomerang and maxima measurements of an acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature at @xmath15 ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ; hanany et al .",
    "2000 ) has provided remarkable confirmation that the growth via gravitational instability of primordial adiabatic density fluctuations seeds large - scale structure .",
    "one consequence of the location of this peak , due to the compression of an acoustic wave on first entering the horizon of last scattering , is that the spatial geometry of the universe is flat .",
    "however , the weakness of the second acoustic peak at @xmath16 , due to the subsequent first rarefaction of the acoustic wave on the last scattering horizon , has provoked considerable speculation as to the additional freedom that could be added to the concordance cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( matter density parameter @xmath0 , flatness being restored by a cosmological constant @xmath1 , hubble parameter @xmath2 , baryon density parameter @xmath3 ) to accommodate such an effect .",
    "ideas that have been proposed include enhancement of the baryon fraction ( lange et al .",
    "2000 ; white et al . 2000 ) , a large neutrino asymmetry ( lesgourgues & peloso 2000 ) , delay of recombination ( hu & peebles 2000 ) , an admixture of a component of cosmological defects ( bouchet et al . 2000 ) and models employing double inflation in supergravity ( kanazawa et al .",
    "2000 ) .    here",
    "we suggest a more phenomenological solution , which is motivated by suggestive , although not overwhelming , evidence from galaxy surveys that there is excess power relative to the scale - invariant @xmath17 fluctuation spectrum of the conventional model near 100 @xmath18 mpc .",
    "the case for excess power has not hitherto been completely convincing because one is probing the limit of current surveys .",
    "nevertheless , several independent data sets have provided such indications ( see e.g. broadhurst et al .",
    "1990 ; einasto et al . 1997 ; landy et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "in fact the multiple inflationary model of adams , ross & sarkar ( 1997 ) predicts the suppression of the second acoustic peak through the generation of features in the primordial power spectrum from phase transitions that occur during inflation .",
    "more generally , there are strong theoretical arguments which suggest that arbitrary features can be dialled onto the primordial power spectrum predicted by generic inflationary models ( see e.g. chung et al . 1999 ; garca - bellido et al 1996 ; lesgourges et al . 1998 ; linde & mukhanov 1997 ; martin et al . 1999 ; randall et al 1996 ; starobinsky 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore consider a primordial power spectrum which incorporates a phenomenological bump , arbitrarily placed at @xmath4 , and characterized by a gaussian in log @xmath5 of standard deviation @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath7 , that is superimposed onto a scale - invariant power spectrum as advocated by silk & gawiser ( 1998 ) .",
    "we examine the constraint on the bump parameters for the @xmath19cdm concordance model ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) ( @xmath20 posed by the cmb data , and restrict the choice of bump parameters to the region of parameter space that is consistent with observations of large - scale power and cmb anisotropies .",
    "in our paper we consider one particular spatially - flat cdm model ; the @xmath19cdm concordance model of ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ) ( @xmath20 .",
    "we assume gaussian and adiabatic initial conditions with a scale - invariant ( @xmath21 ) power law form as predicted by the simplest inflationary models .",
    "the radiation angular power spectrum is calculated using the cmbfast program ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) once the code has been modified to incorporate a bump in the primordial spectrum as advocated by silk & gawiser ( 1998 ) .",
    "we model this bump as a gaussian in log @xmath5 with a central location in wavenumber @xmath4 , a standard deviation @xmath6 , and an amplitude a@xmath22 , resulting in the new primordial power spectrum given below , where @xmath23 is the power spectrum of the model without the feature .",
    "@xmath24    we restrict the choice of bump parameters to the region of parameter space that is consistent with large - scale structure and cmb observations .",
    "the parameters are varied as follows : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "our focus is directed towards determining whether it is possible to resurrect the concordance model without resorting to the proposed ideas listed in our introduction that may prove to contradict observation . since the cmb observations indicate that the second acoustic peak is suppressed in relation to the first acoustic peak , it may be that a dip in the primordial power spectrum around the scale of the second peak could also enable the concordance model to fit the data .",
    "theories that predict a bump in the primordial power spectrum have been inspired by hints of such a feature from large - scale structure observations .",
    "we do not investigate a dip in this paper because there is less theoretical motivation for this scenario .",
    "we attempt to increase the first to second peak ratio with the incorporation of a bump around the scale of the first peak , then renormalize the radiation angular power spectrum to fit the data .",
    ".[obsdat ] the data used in this study . [ cols=\"<,<,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our data sample is listed in table 1 .",
    "it consists of the 8 uncorrelated @xmath9 dmr points from tegmark & hamilton ( 1997 ) , the 12 data points from the boomerang antarctic flight ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) and the 10 recently published maxima data points ( hanany et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we use a simple @xmath8 goodness - of - fit analysis employing the data in table 1 along with the corresponding window functions for the uncorrelated @xmath9 dmr points ( tegmark & hamilton 1997 ) and assuming a top hat window function over the boomerang and maxima bins .",
    "the window functions describe how the anisotropies at different @xmath10 contribute to the observed temperature anisotropies ( lineweaver et al .",
    "1997 ) . for a given theoretical model ,",
    "they enable us to derive a prediction for the @xmath28 that each experiment would see , to be compared with the observations in table 1 .",
    "it has been noted that the use of the @xmath8 test can give a bias in parameter estimation in favour of permitting a lower power spectrum amplitude because in reality there is a tail to high temperature fluctuations .",
    "other methods have been proposed ( bond , jaffe & knox 1998 ; bartlett et al .",
    "1999 ) which give good approximations to the true likelihood , though they require extra information on each experiment which is not yet readily available .",
    "we do not use these more sophisticated techniques here .",
    "there are @xmath29 data points . rather than adopting the @xmath9 normalization ,",
    "the theoretical models are normalized to the full observational data set resulting in a hidden parameter .",
    "we use the method of lineweaver & barbosa ( 1998 ) to treat the correlated calibration uncertainty of the 12 boomerang data points and that of the 10 maxima data points as free parameters with gaussian distributions about their nominal values of 10% for boomerang and 4% for maxima .",
    "this results in two further hidden parameters .",
    "we do not account for the 10% correlation between the boomerang bins nor that between the maxima bins which would further reduce the degrees of freedom .",
    "accounting for the correlations would provide tighter constraints on the models , so the constraints we make are conservative .",
    "because we are measuring absolute goodness - of - fit on a model - by - model basis , with three hidden parameters , the appropriate distribution for the @xmath8 statistic has @xmath30 - 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "nothing further is to be subtracted from this to allow for the number of parameters , as they are not being varied in the fit . to assess whether a model is a good fit to the data ,",
    "we need the confidence levels of this distribution . these are @xmath31 29.87 at the 68% confidence level , @xmath31 40.11 at the 95% confidence level and @xmath31 46.96 at the 99% confidence level .",
    "models which fail these criteria are rejected at the given level .",
    "although we are unable to give the overall best - fitting model for currently permitted cosmologies , since this would require varying each of the cosmological parameters as well as those describing the bump , we find that for the paradigm considered the best - fitting model is @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this model has a @xmath35 of 22.0 which is in good agreement with expectations for a fit to 30 data points with 6 adjustable parameters ( the 3 bump parameters and the 3 hidden parameters ) .    by marginalizing over the bump parameters we are able to determine the 68% confidence level limits on each parameter .",
    "we find that the lower limit on @xmath4 extends right to the edge of the region of parameter space that we are investigating .",
    "we do not feel it necessary to push this limit further since it extends into the region of greatest observational uncertainty due to cosmic variance .",
    "the upper limits in both @xmath6 and a@xmath22 also reach the edges of our parameter space indicating that the cmb data allows a lot of freedom with the amplitude and standard deviation of a bump .",
    "we find that at the 68% confidence level @xmath36 , @xmath37 and a@xmath38 .    in figure",
    "[ f : k_bmp ] we show the best - fitting model as well as a range of @xmath4 models with the same a@xmath22 , @xmath6 and normalization to illustrate the effect of varying @xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ f : varsiga ] we plot the best - fitting model together with models of varying @xmath6 and a@xmath22 . from these figures",
    "it can be seen that , unlike models incorporating a high baryon content , our model predicts a low third acoustic peak .",
    "also these figures highlight that low @xmath10 observations ( 20 @xmath11 200 ) are a critical discriminant of the bumps because beyond the first acoustic peak the models become less distinguishable .",
    "this because the transfer function has a much sharper cutoff on the high @xmath10 side of the first peak , relative to the cutoff on the low @xmath10 side .",
    "+     +    a confidence level contour map of @xmath4 versus a@xmath22 for the cosmology of interest with @xmath6 fixed at 1.05 is shown in figure  [ f : contour ] .",
    "this indicates that , for the chosen cosmology , the scale at which a bump can appear in the primordial power spectrum is quite constrained by the cmb data sample . at the 68% confidence level",
    "we are limited models with a bump at scales @xmath39 mpc@xmath14 for this value of @xmath6 , although we have rather more freedom with the amplitude of the bump .",
    "+    since our incorporation of a bump into the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations was inspired by large - scale structure observations , it is interesting to ask how our modified model compares with the decorrelated linear power spectrum that was recently generated from the pscz catalogue ( hamilton & tegmark 2000 ) .",
    "we treat the 22 decorrelated pscz data points as uncorrelated so that the theoretical model that we find to be the best - fit to the cmb observational data set can be compared with the galaxy survey observations using a @xmath8 test .",
    "the theoretical model is renormalized to the observational data set resulting in a hidden parameter .",
    "this allows for a bias factor @xmath40 where @xmath41 we note that non - linearity corrections to the data are omitted in our comparison . in @xmath19cdm models",
    "the effects of nonlinearity in the matter power spectrum are partially cancelled by galaxy - to - mass antibias , so that the pscz power spectrum is close to linear all the way to @xmath42 mpc@xmath14 [ hamilton 2000 ] .",
    "figure  [ f : density ] plots our best - fitting cmb normalized standard low - density cosmological model with and without the bump against the pscz decorrelated linear power spectrum .",
    "our best - fitting model has been renormalized to the pscz data set with a bias parameter of 1.07 and the model without the bump takes a bias parameter of 1.16 .",
    "both models are a very good fit to these up - to - date large - scale structure observations ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 23.46 at the 68% confidence level ) , but it is clear that the current data does not probe the scales that are critical to discriminating between the models .    as stated in our introduction , several independent large - scale structure data sets provide suggestive , although not overwhelming , evidence that there is excess power relative to the scale - invariant @xmath17 fluctuation spectrum of the conventional model near 100 @xmath18 mpc , corresponding to @xmath46 mpc@xmath14 ( see e.g. broadhurst et al .",
    "1990 ; einasto et al .",
    "1997 ; landy et al .",
    "figure  [ f:100mpc ] shows our best - fitting bump model together with the standard @xmath19cdm model without a bump and the same model with a bump at @xmath47 mpc@xmath14 , each model independently taking its optimal normalization to the full cmb data set .",
    "it is interesting to note that a bump in the primordial power spectrum of any amplitude or standard deviation at @xmath47 mpc@xmath14 is ruled out at the 95% confidence level by the cmb observational data for the @xmath19cdm concordance model .",
    "we describe a toy model for a bump to be included in the primordial density power spectrum with the hope of reviving the standard model without resorting to revising fundamental cosmological theories .",
    "we have confronted our theoretical models with the recent boomerang and maxima data and have shown that it is indeed possible to resurrect the standard model , although we are somewhat restricted with where we place our additional feature .",
    "we find that our model , unlike models that include a high baryon content , predicts a low third acoustic peak .",
    "there are two cmb measurements that will help to discriminate between such a bump and cosmological alternatives for suppressing the second peak .",
    "one is of course the detection of the third peak .",
    "in addition , although low @xmath10 ( 20 - 100 ) observations have received relatively little attention and hence are currently a poor constraint on cosmological parameters , we have found that the low @xmath10 power is potentially a critical discriminant for the possible bump feature .",
    "this because the transfer function has a much sharper cutoff on the high @xmath10 side of the first peak , relative to the cutoff on the low @xmath10 side .",
    "current galaxy redshift survey data suggests that excess power is required at a scale around 100 mpc , corresponding to @xmath4 @xmath12 0.05 @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 ( see e.g. broadhurst et al .",
    "1990 ; einasto et al . 1997",
    "; landy et al .",
    "for the concordance paradigm , use of a bump - like feature to account for this excess is not consistent with the constraints from the cmb data .",
    "we note that models with an appropriately chosen break in the power spectrum provide an alternative model that can give distortions similar to those reported in the apm survey as well as consistency with the cmb data ( atrio - barandela et al .",
    "2000 ; barriga et al .",
    "we prefer however to discount the apm data in favour of the less biased decorrelated linear power spectrum recently constructed from the pscz redshift survey ( hamilton & tegmark 2000 ) .",
    "the incorporation of a bump in the primordial spectrum at a scale of @xmath48 mpc@xmath14 , as the cmb data prefers , is in good agreement with the pscz power spectrum with a bias parameter of 1.07 .",
    "future surveys such as 2df and sdss should be able to probe the large - scale structure power spectrum at the depths required to further test our conjecture .",
    "large - scale velocity field data are useful only at higher @xmath5 as a discriminant of bump - like features , and we will address this issue in a later paper .",
