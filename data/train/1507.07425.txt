    "a disturbance moving atop a fluid or a soft medium deforms the interface shape of the latter , thereby producing a wake .",
    "this is a common phenomenon , which takes place in various natural , scientific and industrial settings  @xcite across several orders of magnitude , ranging from waves generated at the surface of water by animals and watercrafts  @xcite , to patterns observed during the deposition of thin polymer coatings  @xcite .",
    "for instance , at the geophysical scale , the study of gravity - driven flows around human - made obstacles and landscape singularities is essential to understand and minimize the damages caused by natural disasters , such as snow avalanches  @xcite , landslides  @xcite and lava or mud flows  @xcite . in nanophysics , gaining insight on the intrusive effect of local probes , such as atomic force microscopy  @xcite , is crucial in order to improve further the measurement accuracy .    similarly , the wake angle and the wave pattern generated behind a disturbance sailing at the surface of an inviscid liquid remain current topics of interest  @xcite , because they are crucial for naval industry .",
    "in fact , to be maintained , the wake continually consumes energy , the latter being radiated away from the disturbance .",
    "this loss can be formulated into a force , called the wave resistance  @xcite , which needs to be furnished by the controller in order to ensure constant speed . the wave resistance associated to the capillary - gravity wakes",
    "has thus been fully characterized for an incompressible inviscid flow  @xcite , including the cases of dirac and finite - size pressure distributions .",
    "the perturbative role of viscosity on the inertial wave resistance  @xcite has also been considered , as well as the effect of thickness for a viscous liquid film  @xcite .    in the context of viscous thin films",
    "@xcite , a moving external disturbance and the associated wake at the free surface may directly be used as a new kind of fine rheological probe  @xcite .",
    "this idea was also proposed as a possible method to measure slip at the solid - liquid boundary  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , despite the broad applicability of the lubrication theory and its importance for industrial processes , the study of the wake and the wave resistance in such a context is a topic which has been hastily explored and remains an open question .",
    "for instance , the competition between visco - capillary relaxation and perturbation speed , which might control the extent and lifespan of the wake generated by the moving perturbation , has not been studied .",
    "imagine that the footprint left behind by the moving perturbation is arrested by performing a local quenching , before the relaxation of the thin - film occurs  @xcite : this may allow to imprint a narrow channel in the film , thus revealing the foundations of a new nano - patterning technique . additionally , one may be interested in estimating and controlling the amount of energy that this technique requires , for which the wave resistance of a moving disturbance atop a viscous thin film must be well characterized in detail .    in the present study ,",
    "the surface pattern generated by a moving external pressure disturbance along a viscous thin film is described theoretically , within the lubrication approximation , for one- and two - dimensional systems .",
    "the wave resistance is analyzed in both cases , leading to analytical expressions of this force in terms of the disturbance speed and size , and the physical properties of the liquid film .",
