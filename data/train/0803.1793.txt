    "renewed interest in 2d quantum percolation came up in connection with the unusual transport properties of novel materials .",

    "in this situation the fermions move on a random assembly of @xmath21-lattice points .",
    "depending on @xmath3 , the largest cluster of @xmath22 connected @xmath21-sites may span the entire lattice .",

    ", we determine , for @xmath25 , the recurrence probability of a particle to a given site , @xmath26 , which for @xmath27 may serve as a criterion for anderson localization  @xcite . while for extended states on the spanning cluster @xmath28 scales to zero in the thermodynamic limit , for localized states @xmath26 remains finite as @xmath29 .",
    "conceptionally , in a first step , we track the time evolution of an initially localized state ( which , of course , in general is not an eigenstate ) by calculating the modulus square of the wave function at the particle s starting position as a function of time @xmath30 . to this end",

    ", we have to accumulate the @xmath36-weighted contributions of the different orders @xmath41 . as the coefficients @xmath42 depend on the time step but not on time explicitly , we need to calculate them only once . the contributions @xmath43 can then be calculated iteratively using the recurrence relation of the chebyshev polynomials @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . due to the fast asymptotic decay of the bessel functions",
    "@xmath47 the coefficients @xmath36 vanish rapidly above a certain expansion order . as a result from the infinite series only a finite number of @xmath48 terms needs to be taken into account .",

    "thus , as compared to the standard crank - nicolson algorithm , the chebyshev expansion permits the use of a considerably larger time step to achieve the same accuracy , i.e. allows for a very efficient calculation of the time evolution of a given state .    in a second step ,",
    "we employ the so - called local distribution approach  @xcite . in the theoretical investigation of disordered systems",
    "it turns out that the distribution of random quantities is central .",

    "@xmath60 strongly fluctuates throughout the lattice , giving rise to a very asymmetric @xmath61 $ ] with a long tail and @xmath67 .",
    "consequently the distribution function @xmath63 $ ] steeply rises for extended states whereas for localized states the increase extends over several orders of magnitude .",
    "these arguments also hold for the ( time - dependent ) particle density at site @xmath57 @xmath68 if we take additional care of some aspects .",
    "evolving an arbitrary initial state @xmath69 in time , we only have access to @xmath70 , containing contributions of the whole spectrum . calculating the time evolution of an initial state",
    "we have access to @xmath71 on the whole cluster , which gives a much better statistics . on the other hand ,",
    "the chosen initial conditions introduce an additional dependency . especially for localized states",
    "the local environment of the starting position will influence @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "so for @xmath71 , in addition to taking the thermodynamic limit , we have to examine different initial conditions .",
    "while the ldos approach allows for an energy resolved examination of the localization problem , @xmath71 gives no information about @xmath73 because it contains contributions from all @xmath59 .",
    "but , starting from @xmath2 and increasing @xmath3 , we detect at a certain @xmath74 the first occurrence of extended states somewhere in the spectrum .",
    "for an initially localized state on the spanning cluster of a @xmath75 square lattice for @xmath76 ( left ) and @xmath77 ( right ) . due to normalization , for an extended state evenly spread over all sites of the spanning cluster",
    "this quantity is equal to unity . ]",
    "the curves correspond to the data in fig .",
    "[ perc_2d_waveampl ] , supplemented by the distribution functions at @xmath78 ( dot - double - dashed curve ) . ]    let us now discuss the outcome of our numerical investigations .",
    "figure  [ perc_2d_waveampl ] compares the time evolution of an initially localized state on the spanning cluster for low ( left panels ) and high ( right panels ) concentration of @xmath21 sites , for which qualitatively different behaviors emerge . for small @xmath79 , the initial state spreads within a short time over a finite region of the spanning cluster .",
    "but also for very long times , @xmath80 , this extension does not change significantly anymore . for larger @xmath3 ,",
    "the spreading is even faster .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , for @xmath77 the state is not confined to some finite region , but @xmath71 is transfered to the whole cluster . since the initial state is a superposition of eigenstates from the whole spectrum , it also contains contributions from localized states , for instance near the band edges . those are reflected in the darker spots in the vicinity of the initial position , which persist there , even for very long times .",
    "this signature of localized states we already know from the case of small @xmath3 .",
    "the essential new feature is that for large @xmath3 some eigenstates exist , which are not localized , i.e. spread over the whole cluster .    to go beyond this simple visualization and account for a quantitative description , in fig .",
    "[ distevolve ] we show the corresponding local particle density distribution functions @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the different behavior of localized and extended states becomes obvious as the time increases .",
    "since these results were obtained for a particular sample and a certain starting position it is necessary to ask how strong these findings depend on the initial conditions , and if they are representative for the underlying @xmath55 $ ] .    to answer this question",
    "we examine systematically the influence of the initial conditions on the behavior of the state . in this respect the geometry and energy of the initial state , the starting position on the cluster as well as the particular cluster realization @xmath56",
    "should be of importance .",
    "a fingerprint in which all these aspects come into play is the ldos of the initial state .    in fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] we examine the influence of these issues one by one .",
    "fixing a particular cluster realization and starting position of the wave function , we may construct several initial states with the same total energy .",
    "this can be done by choosing a different number of sites which initially have non - vanishing amplitudes . for a state with finite amplitude only on two neighboring sites , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ,",
    "we get @xmath83 and we may continuously tune @xmath84 $ ] by choice of @xmath81 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] a and c ) .",
    "these energies may also be constructed for more complicated initial states , as e.g. for the one shown in fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] b , with non - vanishing amplitudes on six adjacent sites .",
    "the more complicated these structures get and the more sites are involved , the larger energies of the initial state are possible , e.g. for the configuration of fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] b up to @xmath85 .",
    "as stressed above , these energies are not eigenenergies of @xmath86 , i.e. the initial state is a superposition of eigenstates from the whole spectrum .",
    "a quantitative characterization of the amount of different contributions can be obtained by the ldos of the initial state .",
    "changing the starting position ( fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] d ) or the cluster realization ( fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] e ) has a similar effect .",
    "essentially , we see the same behavior as for the changes in figs .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] a - c .",
    "most notably , although the ldos at @xmath78 and the evolution of the states differs in detail , on a coarse grained scale they behave similarly .",
    "this is also corroborated by the behavior of the distribution function @xmath87 $ ] for sufficient long times @xmath30 . despite minor differences between the five curves ,",
    "they agree on showing the characteristics of a localized state ( fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] f , solid lines ) .",
    "the more a state is localized , i.e. the lower @xmath3 , the more the local structure of the spanning cluster influences its evolution and thus @xmath87 $ ] . at large @xmath3 ,",
    "the dependency of an extended state on the above criteria is much weaker , as in this case the local environment of the starting position is less important ( fig .",
    "[ dependency_ic ] f , dashed lines ) .",
    "overall , the characteristics of the time evolution is mainly determined by the cluster structure , the initial state has only minor influence .",
    "this holds as the random nature of the cluster guarantees a similar structure above a certain scale .",
    "finally one may ask if the chosen boundary conditions or the linear extension ( odd / even ) of the lattice influences the dynamics . the latter distinction has been shown to be important for a bond percolation model because of the bipartiteness of the underlying lattice  @xcite . in our case , however , we did not see an influence on the results .",
    "system at @xmath76 .",
    "the colormap is the same as the one in fig.[perc_2d_waveampl ] .",

    "the inset shows the dependency of this quantity on the time difference for the @xmath93 system in the quasi - stationary regime .",
    "note the different axis scales . ]    in view of a finite - size scaling of the numerical data we first have to ensure that the obtained distribution function has already become quasi - stationary . to check this",
    ", we calculate the @xmath94 norm of the difference between two distribution functions at different times .",
    "due to fluctuations , we can not expect this quantity to vanish completely even for large times . for @xmath95 , however , we have reached the quasi - stationary regime for all considered system sizes ( cf .",
    "[ distdiff ] ) . at this time",
    ", the wave function has reached its maximum extension and the further development is governed by amplitude fluctuations from site to site . in this regime , the difference between the distribution functions does not depend on time anymore ( inset of fig .  [ distdiff ] ) , which is a clear indication of random fluctuations without additional drift motion .",
    "this allows for a determination of the quasi - stationary distribution function together with an error estimation and enables us to compare different system sizes . in view of computation time , the scaling @xmath96 together with the linear dependency on the dimension of the hilbert space for the chebyshev expansion leaves us with a scaling @xmath97 .    as soon as we have quasi - stationary distribution functions , their dependency on the system size may be exploited for a quantitative distinction between localized and extended states ( fig .",
