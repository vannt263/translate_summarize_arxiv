    "in 1991 , when tsubono from university of tokyo visited our gravitation laboratory in tsing hua university , we discussed the technical development of ultra - high sensitive interferometers for gravity - wave detection . during the last day before his departure , we pondered about how we could apply these developed techniques for fundamental physics and we discussed the possibility of doing the interferometric qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) tests . after analyzing the sensitivities , we believed that the qed birefringence would be measurable @xcite .",
    "after the call for eoi s ( expression of interest ) of using the onsite ssc ( superconducting super collider ) facilities in march , 1994 by doe of usa , we submitted a joint eoi with a us team @xcite .",
    "the topic of this eoi was chosen as one of the six topics for project definition study proposals .",
    "we then submitted such a proposal @xcite in june and finished the study at the end of october , 1994 @xcite .",
    "the project definition review was well - received .",
    "a five - year proposal @xcite was submitted to the national science council of the republic of china for the roc part of the funding simultaneously .",
    "this proposal was approved in january , 1995 pending on the approval of the us proposal of the collaboration .",
    "partial funding was allocated for the first year . however , due to lack of potential funding of the us counterpart , this program of collaboration was halted .",
    "nevertheless , in 1994 , we started to build the experimental facility for the q a experiment ( qed and axion experiment ) [ 6 - 8 ] acquiring two vacuum tanks of the laser - interferometric gravity - wave detector type and working on the measurement of mirror birefringence @xcite . since 1991",
    "we have worked on precision interferometry ",
    "laser stabilization schemes , laser metrology and fabry - perot interferometers . with these experiences",
    ", we started in 1994 to build a 3.5m/7 m prototype interferometer for measuring vacuum birefringence and improving the sensitivity of axion search as part of our continuing effort in precision interferometry .",
    "in june , 1994 in the marcel grossmann meeting at stanford , we met the pvlas people , exchanged a few ideas and encouraged each other .",
    "we learned that pvlas also started in the same year adapting their earlier scheme proposed in 1979 @xcite .    in 2002",
    ", we finished the first phase of constructing the 3.5 m prototype interferometer and made some cotton - mouton coefficient and verdet coefficient measurements @xcite .",
    "starting 2002 , we have been in the second phase of q a experiment .",
    "the results of our second phase on dichroism and cotton - mouton effect ( cme ) measurement have been reported in @xcite and @xcite . in section 2 and section 3 ,",
    "we review our achieved optical sensitivity and summarize our gaseous cme measurement results .",
    "we are starting the 3rd phase of our q a experiment extending the 3.5 m interferometer to 7 m with upgrades .",
    "these together with the goal of this phase will be presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 concludes with discussion and outlook .",
    "the schematic of the present setup of our second phase is shown in fig . 2 of reference @xcite and fig . 1 of reference @xcite .",
    "these references gave details of the experimental setup .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] shows a picture of the experimental apparatus .",
    "our 3.5 m prototype interferometer is formed using a high - finesse fabry - perot interferometer together with a high - precision ellipsometer .",
    "the two high - reflectivity mirrors of the 3.5 m prototype interferometer are suspended separately from two x - pendulum - double pendulum suspensions mounted on two isolated tables fixed to ground using bellows inside two vacuum chambers .",
    "the sub - systems are described in [ 14 - 16 , 12 ] .",
    "our results in this phase give ( @xmath20.2 @xmath3 2.8 ) @xmath4 10@xmath5 rad / pass with 18,700 passes through a 2.3 t 0.6 m long magnet for vacuum dichroism measurement , and limit pseudo - scalar - photon interaction and millicharged fermions meaningfully @xcite .",
    "upon passing through a medium with transverse magnetic field , linearly polarized light becomes elliptically polarized .",
    "cotton and mouton first investigated this in detail in 1905 , and the phenomenon is known as cotton - mouton effect .",
    "we use our q a apparatus to measure the cmes at wavelength 1064 nm in nitrogen , oxygen , carbon dioxide , argon , and krypton in a magnetic field b = 2.3 t at pressure p = 0.5 - 300 torr and temperature t = 295 - 298 k. our measured results are compiled in table [ table : cm ] @xcite . for the cotton - mouton coefficient , we follow the convention of @xcite and use the normalized cotton - mouton birefringence @xmath6 at p = 1 atm and b = 1 t. our results agree with the pvlas results @xcite in the common cases ( kr , n@xmath7 , o@xmath7 ) within 1.2 @xmath8 . for ar and co@xmath7 at 1064 nm ,",
    "our results are new .",
    "we are currently upgrading our interferometer from 3.5 m armlength to 7 m armlength in the 3rd phase .",
    "we have installed a new 1.8 m 2.3 t permanent magnet capable of rotation up to 13 cycles per second to enhance the physical effects .",
    "figure [ fig : newsetup ] shows the configuration with our new magnet .",
    "we are working with 532 nm nd : yag laser as light source with cavity finesse around 100,000 , and aim at 10 nrad / hz@xmath0 optical sensitivity . _ with all these achieved and the upgrading of vacuum , qed birefringence would be measured to 28 @xmath1 in about 50 days_. along the way , we should be able to improve on the dichroism detection significantly . to enhance the physical effects further , another",

    "we have heard a suite of motivations to search for ( pseudo)scalar - photon interactions and to measure qed birefringence effect in this patras 2009 workshop ( see @xcite and other articles in these proceedings ; we refer the readers to various other experiments to the proceedings also ) . for qed birefringence , the next stage after detection is to measure the next - order effects which include hadron and potential new physical contribution @xcite",
    ". this would be possible by extending the interferometer further with more rotatable permanent magnet .",
    "many useful techniques have been developed in the gravitational wave detection community .",
