    "rare earth ternary silicides and germanides of the type re@xmath0t@xmath1x@xmath2 , where t is a transition metal and x is either si or ge have been extensively investigated for their unusual magnetic and superconducting properties and the rich variety of structures they form in @xcite .",
    "in particular , compounds belonging to the re@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 series have prompted considerable efforts to understand their superconductivity and magnetism @xcite .",
    "both tm@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 and lu@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 compounds show superconductivity at low temperatures . in the tm sample , superconductivity at about 1.5  k is destroyed by the onset of anti - ferromagnetic order at 1  k and it re - enters the normal state @xcite whereas lu@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 has the highest t@xmath9= 6  k for an iron containing compound @xcite .",
    "recently it was reported that er@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 was also found to be superconducting below 1  k @xcite . in this structure ,",
    "fe does not have any moment and it only helps in building up the large density of states at the fermi level .",
    "recently we have established yb@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 to be a heavy fermion compound with kondo - lattice behavior and anti - ferromagnetic ordering below 1.7  k @xcite .",
    "thus it is clear that compounds of the series re@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 exhibit unusual superconducting and magnetic properties .",
    "the re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 series of compounds form in a structure closely related to the re@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xmath2 structure .",
    "the compound ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 of this series has been studied in some detail by various groups @xcite but there have been little efforts to make a detailed study of the other compounds of the series re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "recently we had succeded in preparing and studying the compound yb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "we found that apart from showing interesting low temperature properties @xcite it also formed in a structure different from it s ce analogue .",
    "this prompted us to make a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of the complete re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 series to look for systematic trends and variations in the physical properties across the series .",
    "here we report our detailed resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , isothermal magnetization and heat - capacity results for the series re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( re@xmath3y , la , ce - nd , gd - tm , lu ) from 1.5 to 300  k.",
    "samples of re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( re@xmath3y , la - nd , gd - tm , lu ) were made by melting the individual constituents ( taken in stoichiometric proportions ) in an arc furnace under ti gettered high - purity argon atmosphere on a water cooled copper hearth .",
    "the purity of the rare - earth metals and ir was 99.9% whereas the purity of ge was 99.999% .",
    "the alloy buttons were flipped over and remelted five to six times to ensure homogenous mixing .",
    "the samples were annealed at 950  @xmath10c for a period of 10 days before slowly cooling down to room temperature .",
    "the x - ray powder diffraction pattern of the samples did not show the presence of any parasitic impurity phases .",
    "the samples with re@xmath3 y , la , ce - dy , were found to adopt the tetragonal ibam ( u@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 type ) structure as reported earlier for the compound ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 @xcite whereas the compounds for re@xmath3 er - lu , crystallize in an orthorhombic structure with a space group pmmn which we had recently reported @xcite for the sample yb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "the x - ray pattern for the sample ho@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 always showed many extra reflections which shows that ho was the transition point for the structural change .",
    "although the x - ray for the sample er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 did not show any extra peaks , preliminary microanalysis study showed the presence of a small amount of second phase .",
    "the lattice constants a , b and c are given in table 1 where they are seen to decrease across the series ( i.e. , from ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 to dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ) .",
    "the u@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 structure has only a single site for u whereas the pmmn structure allows two sites for the rare - earth element .",
    "hence , the net hybridization between d- and f- orbitals can be very different for these two structures which has to be taken into account in the analysis of magnetic ordering temperatures .",
    "+ the temperature dependence of dc susceptibility ( @xmath11 ) was measured using a commercial squid magnetometer in the temperature range from 1.8 to 300  k. the ac susceptibility was measured using a home - built susceptometer @xcite from 1.5 to 20  k. the absolute accuracy with which magnetization measurements were performed is within 1% .",
    "the resistivity was measured using an ac resistance bridge ( linear research inc .",
    ", usa ) from 1.5 to 300  k. we used a four - probe dc technique with contacts made using silver paint on thin slides cut from the annealed samples .",

    "the inset for la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 clearly shows an abrupt diamagnetic drop just below 1.75  k which marks the onset of the sample into the superconducting state . in the normal state",
    "the @xmath11 of la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is diamagnetic between 75 to 300  k but shows a curie - wiess like tail as we go down in temperature .",
    "it is possible that there is a small amount of magnetic impurity in la or ir metals .",
    "however , the susceptibility @xmath11 for both the y and lu samples are practically temperature independent down to low temperatures with only small upturns at the lowest temperatures ( probably due to paramagnetic impurities ) hence the possibility of ir having a significant amount of impurity is remote . for y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , a somewhat sharper diamagnetic transition below 2.5  k as seen in the low temperature inset for this compound",
    "signals the transition into the superconducting state for this compound .",
    "we did not observe any diamagnetic signal down to 1.8  k for lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",

    "similar data for re@xmath3gd , tb and dy are shown in fig .",
    "insets show the low temperature @xmath11 behavior of the respective compounds .",
    "the high temperature susceptibility ( 100  k @xmath13 t @xmath13 300  k ) could be fitted to a modified curie - weiss expression which is given by , @xmath14 where c is the curie constant which can be written in terms of the effective moment as , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of magnetic re ions per formula unit .",
    "the values of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are given in table 2 .",
    "the main contributions to the temperature independent @xmath17 are namely , the diamagnetic susceptibility which arises due to the presence of ion cores and the pauli spin susceptibility of the conduction electrons . the estimated effective moment in all the cases is found to be quite close to the free ion moment of re@xmath20 ion telling us that we are dealing with trivalent rare - earth ions here . for most of the compounds ( except ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ) ,",
    "we get a relatively small and negative value of the curie - weiss temperature ( @xmath19 ) . a negetive",
    "@xmath19 implies the presence of antiferromagnetic correlations . for ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2",

    "this is in agreement with an earlier report @xcite which also estimated a large value of -160  k for @xmath19 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 for most of the other samples is between -10 to -20  k which although smaller than the value for ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , is still somewhat larger than e.g. the values obtained for the compounds of the series re@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the insets clearly show the antiferromagnetic ordering for all the compounds . for ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , we also observe an abrupt upturn in the susceptibility below 4.5  k after the sample has undergone an anti - ferromagnetic transition at 8.5  k. this upturn in @xmath11 below t@xmath8 was also observed in an earlier work @xcite .",
    "there are no signatures of this transition in the resistivity but there is a weak kink in the heat capacity data .",
    "this feature seen in both the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements could be intrinsic to the sample or may be due to a smal ferromagnetic impurity phase .",
    "microanalysis studies are needed to verify whether this behavior is intrinsic to the sample .",
    "the low temperature @xmath11 data for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 also shows a second shoulder like feature around 4.5  k apart from the anti - ferromagnetic transition at about 12  k. the transition temperatures of various compounds obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements are listed in table 3 .",
    "the ordering temperatures have been determined from peaks / inflection points in the d(@xmath11t)/dt vs t plots .",
    "the d(@xmath11t)/dt vs t plots for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 showed additional anomalies apart from the single transition visible in the @xmath21 data .",

    "thus it can be seen that nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 shows two anomalies at 2.1 and 2.82  k while dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 shows three anomalies at 2 , 4.3 and 7.2  k. we will later show that these multiple transitions are also observed in the resistivity and heat capacity measurements .",
    "the plots of the inverse magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature for the magnetic compounds forming in the different pmmn structure ie re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( re@xmath3er and tm ) is shown in fig .",
    "the insets show the low temperature susceptibility @xmath11 data .",
    "curie - wiess fits to the high temperature ( 100 @xmath13 t @xmath13 300  k ) inverse susceptibility ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) data gives values of the effective moments which are close to the re@xmath20 values .",
    "the parameters obtained from the fit are given in table 2 along with the values for the other compounds .",
    "we did not observe any signature of magnetic ordering for both tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 down to 1.8  k although the d(@xmath11t)/dt vs t plot for the er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 sample shown as the second inset in the top panel of fig .",
    "5 shows a minimum just around 2  k which could be a possible signature of magnetic order .",
    "this is corroborated by anomalies at the same temperature in the resistivity and heat capacity data which we will discuss below .",
    "isothermal magnetization measurements at temperatures both above and below the neel temperature t@xmath8 have been performed on some of the samples of the series re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",

    "we observe a non - linear behavior in m vs h at 2  k ( @xmath13 t@xmath8 ) for all the samples .",
    "this non - linear behavior agrees with the notion of antiferromagnetic ordering of re@xmath20 spins .",
    "this non - linear behavior persists upto 7  k in the case of ce compound . at higher temperatures ( t @xmath22 t@xmath8 )",
    ", one observes the usual linear behavior in magnetization which characterizes the paramagnetic state .",
    "the magnetization values of ce are very small presumably due to the presence of kondo effect .",
    "the magnetization data for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 at 2  k starts out linearly upto 10  koe but shows a slight upturn at higher fields which continues upto 60  koe with no sign of saturation . at 20",
    "k the magnetization is linear upto the highest fields with a slightly smaller slope than the curve at 2  k. the magnetization data of nd and dy at 2  k show an s type of shape with increasing field indicating possible metamagnetic transitions .",
    "the magnetization for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 at 2  k starts out linearly but begins to show an upturn starting at 15  koe which continues upto a field of 40  koe after which it shows signs of saturating at higher fields reaching a value of 2.77@xmath23 which is slightly lower than the free ion value of 3.62@xmath23 for nd@xmath24 .",
    "higher fields may be required to reach the full moment value since the magnetization has not completely saturated even for the highest field (  =  60  koe ) used in our measurements .",
    "this metamagnetic upturn is also seen in the magnetization curve at 3  k. at 15  k , we get the linear behavior expected in the paramagnetic state .",
    "the magnetization for dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 at 2  k and 5  k starts out with a slightly sublinear behaviour at low fields upto about 10  koe after which it begins to curve upwards upto a field of 25  koe . for higher fields it sort of saturates , reaching a value of about 10.4@xmath25@xmath26 at 60  koe which is close to the free moment value for dy@xmath20 ions .",
    "a similar behavior for the magnetization with saturation at 50  koe is seen at a temperature of 15  k which is much above the neel temperature of 7  k for dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "a linear behavior for the magnetization is seen only at 35  k. clearly there are short range magnetic correlations even above t@xmath8 in this compound and this aspect would be worth further investigation prefarably by neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the resistivity data ( @xmath4 ) for la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "the insets show the low temperature data which clearly show a sharp drop in the resistivity marking the onset of the superconducting transitions for both the samples below 1.7  k and 2.4  k respectively .",
    "this drop corresponds with the diamagnetic signal observed in the susceptibility measurement for both the samples .",
    "an earlier report @xcite did not find any superconductivity for la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "however , their investigations had been carried out only down to 1.8  k below which we observe the resistive drop and diamagnetic signal in the susceptibility .",
    "the resistivity ( @xmath4 ) data for the re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( re  =   ce - dy ) series is shown in fig .  8 and fig .",
    "the insets for all the samples shows the low temperature data on an expanded scale . from the insets",
    "one can see that the resistivity data of all the magnetic rare earth samples except that of pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 show a change of slope at their respective magnetic transitions . for the dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 sample",
    ", one can see from the inset in fig .",
    "9 that there is a second feature which appears as a shoulder at about 4.5  k below the anti - ferromagnetic transition at 8  k. there is a similar but much weaker feature in the @xmath4 data for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 below the main transition at 12  k. this corresponds to the second peak observed in the susceptibility data for this sample .",
    "however , there is only one distinct change of slope in the low temperature @xmath4 data for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 whereas we had seen two anomalies in the d(@xmath11)/dt vs t plots and which are also seen in the heat capacity data discussed later .",
    "plotting d(@xmath4)/dt vs t brings out the third transition in dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and the second transition in gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 more disticntly as shown in fig .",
    "however , taking d(@xmath4)/dt for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 did not help because it was very noisy and possibly the two transitions are very close together in temperature and may not be individually distinguishable in the resistivity data .",
    "11 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath4 for er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 which crystallize in the orthogonal pmmn structure .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath4 behavior for these compounds is anomalous showing a semiconducting rise of @xmath4 for all three compounds as we cool down from 300  k. it is interesting to note that we had found a positive temperature coeffecient of the resistivity for the sample yb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 @xcite in the same temperature range .",
    "similar behavior for the resistivity has been observed earlier for the series of compounds r@xmath1ru@xmath5ge@xmath6 @xcite and rbipt @xcite where the resistivity for all samples except yb showed a semiconducting response .",
    "the er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 data is highly anomalous .",
    "it initially increases with decreasing temperature like it s isostructural neihbours tm and lu",
    "but then it reaches a broad maximum at nearly 100  k before starting to decrease more or less linearly with temperature .",
    "the resistivity then shows an upturn at about 5  k similar to that seen in kondo lattice systems before decreasing abruptly below 2  k indicating a possible magnetic ordering .",
    "evidence of magnetic order has earlier been seen in the d@xmath11/dt vs t plot which showed an anomaly at 2  k and we will later see that the heat capacity for this sample also shows a peak around 2  k. there is no evidence of any ordering in the resistivity data for tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 down to 1.8  k. there is an abrupt drop of almost 70% in the @xmath4 for lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 below 2  k which may possibly be the onset of superconductivity although the resistivity does not fall completely to zero .",
    "our heat capacity data also shows an incomplete anomaly just below 2  k as will be discussed later .",
    "the transition temperatures observed from resistivity data are compared with those obtained from susceptibility and heat - capacity studies ( described later ) in table 3 .",
    "+ in the normal state _",
    "i.e. _ above the superconducting / magnetic transition temperatures , we have been able to fit the low temperature ( t@xmath9 or t@xmath8 to 25  k ) dependence of @xmath4 to a power law which can be written as , @xmath27 the values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and n are given in table  4 .",
    "for la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , the optimum value of n was found to be 3.6 and 3.3 , respectively .",
    "these values do not agree with wilson s s - d scattering model which predicts a t@xmath30 dependence of @xmath4(t ) for t@xmath13  @xmath31/10 .",
    "the discrepancy could arise due to a variety of reasons such as , complex structure of the fermi surface , phonon - drag effects and lattice anharmonicity .",
    "+ the @xmath4 of most of the magnetic rare - earth samples ( except ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ) shows a power law dependence in the low temperature paramagnetic region ( t@xmath8@xmath13t@xmath1325  k ) with n different from 2 in all cases except for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "the value of n for both tb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is nearly equal to 2.1 however , the values for pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( n  =  2.4 ) and nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( n  =  1.7 ) deviate markedly from the t@xmath32 dependence and are not understood at present .",

    "this has been seen in many compounds where the value of @xmath4 becomes sufficiently large for the mean free path to shorten to the order of a few atomic spacings .",
    "when that happens , the scattering cross section will no longer be linear in the scattering perturbation .",
    "since the dominant temperature- dependent scattering mechanism is electron - phonon interaction here , the @xmath4 will no longer be proportional to the mean square atomic displacement , which is proportional to t for a harmonic potential .",
    "instead , the resistance will rise less rapidly than linearly in t and will show negative curvature ( d@xmath32@xmath4/dt@xmath32  @xmath130 ) .",

    "we have used la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 for the purpose since we find that in some cases the lattice contribution is overestimated if we use y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 . for the samples with re",

    "the large peak seen at 8.3  k in the inset confirms the bulk ordering of the ce@xmath20 moments .",
    "this temperature is comparable to the values of the transition temperature as obtained by the @xmath11 and @xmath4(t ) measurements .",
    "this transition temperature also closely resembles the previously reported values @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that we observe a small shoulder at 4.3  k in the c@xmath48 data where we had observed a strong ferromagnetic upturn in the @xmath11 data .",
    "the extrapolated value for the sommerfeld s electronic heat - capacity coefficient @xmath45 was found to be 188 mj / ce  mol  k@xmath32 which classifies it as a moderately heavy fermion system .",
    "however , estimation of @xmath45 from data above t@xmath8 can be easily influenced by magnetic correlations and cef effects and may not be strictly correct . for a correct estimation of the true value of @xmath45 , data down to much lower temperatures would be required .",
    "the estimated entropy at 30  k is found to be 8.83  j/  ce  mol  k which is much less than the expected value of rln(2j+1 ) ( with j  =  5/2 for ce ) .",
    "the reduced value of the entropy implies that there are higher lying cef levels which have not been populated at these temperatures and so the whole entropy is not released . the kondo effect seen in the resistivity data",
    "could also be partly responsible for the reduced entropy .",
    "the experimentally obtained values of the entropy and the expected values have been compared for all compounds in table 6 .    the temperature dependence of c@xmath43 from 1.8 to 30  k of pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is also shown in fig .",
    "the inset clearly shows a distinct peak at a t@xmath32 value corresponding to a temperature just above 2  k. this anomaly in the heat capacity , along with the peak in the susceptibility data at a similar temperature clearly establishes bulk antiferromagnetic ordering for the compound although we did not see any change in slope in the resistivity data down to 1.7  k. we observe a broad hump around 7  k in the c@xmath49 data .",
    "this is more prominent in the magnetic heat capacity c@xmath50 obtained by subtracting the lattice part .",
    "this could be a schottky type anomaly indicating the presence of low lying excited cef levels which become populated as the temperature is increased .",

    "the authors have used a singlet ground state and a doublet excited state for the cef levels to explain the data .",
    "the estimated entropy of 15.8  j / pr  mol  k at 30  k is again found to be less than the expected value of rln(2j+1 ) clearly suggesting the influence of cef levels at these temperatures .    the temperature dependence of c@xmath43 from 1.8 to 30  k of nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "12 ) shows two distinct and seperate anomalies ( seen more clearly in the c@xmath48/t vs t@xmath32 inset ) at 2  k and 2.8  k corroborating the two anomalies seen earlier in the d@xmath11/dt plot .",
    "the estimated entropy in this case is also much less than the expected value of rln(2j+1 ) ( see table 6 ) which implies the presence of cef contributions .",
    "the c@xmath43 for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 from 1.8 to 30  k is shown in fig .",
    "we observe a large @xmath51 type anomaly at 11.2  k which clearly indicates bulk magnetic ordering of gd@xmath20 moments .",
    "a broad shoulder is also visible at 4.2  k which corresponds with the second peak seen earlier in the @xmath11 and d@xmath4/dt data at roughly the same temperature .",
    "this second anomaly can be associated with the way the ( 2j+1 ) multiplet under consideration evolves within the ordered state .",
    "this low temperature hump following a magnetic transition at a higher temperature has been seen in some other gd based compounds such as gdbipt @xcite and gdcu@xmath0si@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the inset with the low temperature c@xmath48/t vs t@xmath32 data shows the two anomalies more clearly .",
    "the estimated entropy at 30  k is found to be 16.8  j / gd  mol  k which is nearly equal to the expected value of rln(2j+1 ) .",
    "note that at t@xmath8 the entropy has already reached 88@xmath52 of its value at 30  k.    the c@xmath43 data for tb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 also shown in fig .",
    "13 shows a huge ( 10  j / tb  mol ) peak at the magnetic ordering temperature of 6  k. the magnetic heat capacity shows what looks like the low temperature tail of a schottky like hump around 29  k. the reduced entropy value at 30  k is indicative of cef effects being important at these temperatures .",
    "the c@xmath48 vs t data for dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 shown in the same figure shows three distinct anomalies at 2.1  k , 4.8  k and 7.4  k. we had also seen three anomalies at roughly these temperatures in the d@xmath11/dt and d@xmath4/dt plots for this sample .",
    "these features below the first main transition could be due to reorientation of the spins in the ordered state .",
    "usually the change is small enough to escape a distinct detection in a magnetic measurement .",
    "however , in the reorientation of spins , some degree of freedom is involved and hence a signature in the heat capacity .",
    "reorientation of spins is just a conjecture at the present time and it is possible that this compound actually has a complicated magnetic structure at low temperatures .",
    "this issue can be settled with neutron diffraction to probe the low temperature magnetic structure and the changes it undergoes across the three transitions .",
    "the last panel in the same figure shows the c@xmath48 data for y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "the inset showing the c@xmath48/t vs t@xmath32 data at low temperatures shows an anomaly peaked at t@xmath32  =  6  k@xmath32 which corresponds to the superconducting transition seen at 2.5  k in the @xmath4 and @xmath11 measurements .",
    "the value of @xmath53c/@xmath45t@xmath9 is found to be .64 which is much reduced from the value 1.43 for a bcs type superconductor .",
    "this indicates that y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is a very weakely coupled superconductor .",
    "14 shows the heat capacity data for the compounds re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( re  =  er , tm , lu ) forming in the structure different from the rest of the compounds .",
    "the c@xmath48 data for er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 shows an upturn at low temperatures starting at 6  k and undergoes a maximum peaked around 1.9  k. however , we could not trace the complete transition down to lower temperatures because of experimental limitations .",
    "this corresponds with the anomalies seen in the d@xmath11/dt and @xmath4 data discussed earlier .",
    "the c@xmath48 data for tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 shown in the same figure also shows an upturn below 3.5  k which continues down to 1.8  k. this may be the onset of the magnetic ordering of tm@xmath20 moments in this sample which we have not been able to capture because of the transition being below 2  k. the estimated entropy of only 9.2 j / tm  mol  k at 30  k is much reduced from the expected value of ln(2j+1 ) ( with j  =  6 for tm ) .",
    "however , it must be noted that we see a strong indication that the compound may order below 2  k and a lot of entropy would be sitting under the peak at the transition when it occurs . the heat capacity data for lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "the c@xmath48 vs t@xmath32 inset shows an incomplete anomaly around 2  k which corresponds with the abrupt drop in resistivity at the same temperature and could be a signature of superconductivity in this compound although we could not observe any diamagnetic signal in our magnetic measurements down to 1.8  k.",
    "in this section we will make an attempt to understand the temperature dependence of the measured physical properties and the models which we have used to understand their behavior and look for systematic trends followed across the series .",
    "we begin with the susceptibility behaviour .",
    "the high temperature data for all samples could be fitted to a modified curie - wiess law .",
    "the extracted effective moments for all samples are close to their theoretical values for free re@xmath20 ions showing that we are dealing with trivalent moments here and that there is no contribution from the ir .",
    "it must be recalled that the yb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 sample showed a much reduced moment estimated from the high temperature data and that was attributed to the fact that the rare - earth element has two inequivalent sites in the crystal structure and so the yb could have a different valence at the two sites @xcite .",
    "we see here that both the er and tm samples , which form in the same structure as the yb sample show trivalent behaviour with er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 undergoing magnetic ordering below 2  k as seen in the heat capacity and resistivity measurements while tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is also seen to be on the verge of magnetic order and we can already see the onset in the low temperature heat capacity inset for the sample . from table  2",
    "it can be seen that the temperature independent susceptibility @xmath17 is non - negligible for some cases which possibly indicates a large density of states at the fermi level n(e@xmath54 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath55 are found to be of the order of -15  k ( see table 2 ) for most of the compounds .",
    "these values are significantly higher than those of re@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 @xcite for example .",
    "this explains the higher values of the t@xmath8 s of the compounds of the re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 series .",
    "the data begins to deviate from the curie - wiess behaviour at lower temperatures because of the influence of crystalline electric feilds and because the magnetic correlations begin to grow . in the section where we described the results from susceptibility measurements we mentioned that we have used the d(@xmath11t)/dt vs t plots to determine the antiferromagnetic transition temperatures . near an antiferromagnetic transition the temperature dependence of d(@xmath11t)/dt mimicks the magnetic heat capacity curve @xcite .",
    "this was demonstrated beautifully in fig  4 where we had plotted d(@xmath11t)/dt vs t for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 . comparing this curve with the magnetic heat capacity of nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2",
    ", one can see a clear similarity in the shape of the curves near the various transitions .",
    "the transition temperatures however , can be deduced unambigously by this method only by taking into account data from other measurements also because taking the derivative sometimes gives some spurious peaks and in general the noise is enhanced in the derivative and so one has to be careful in determining t@xmath8 by this method .",
    "we now turn our attentions to the resistivity data . from table  4",
    "it can be seen that most of the samples have resistivity values typical of rare - earth intermetallic compounds at low temperatures .",
    "the power law fit to the low temperature data for la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 in their normal state as described in the section iii b shows that the data deviates from the expected t@xmath30 dependence predicted by the wilsons s - d scattering model .",
    "there are cases of many non - magnetic intermetallic alloys where the low temperature resistivity data deviates from the t@xmath30 dependence and follows a power law behaviour with n@xmath133 .",
    "however , it is difficult to find many compounds showing n@xmath223 as we find for both la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "the reasons are not well understood at present but could be due to lattice anharmonicity or phonon drag effects .",
    "attempts to fit the resistivity data in the paramagnetic region for the compounds containing magnetic rare - earth show that only gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 follows a t@xmath32 dependence suggesting dominance of scattering by spin fluctuations at these temperatures for this compound .",
    "both tb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 show a power law behaviour with n  =  2.1 which is close to the t@xmath32 dependence . however , for both pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 we find a marked deviation from the t@xmath32 law with n being equal to 2.4 and 1.7 respectively .",
    "these t@xmath56 and t@xmath57 dependences for @xmath4 at low temperatures is quite puzzling and not understood at present .",
    "the ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 compound shows heavy fermion behaviour and the expected t@xmath32 behaviour might occur at very low temperatures .",
    "we could also fit the data below t@xmath8 for many magnetic samples to a power law dependence .",
    "the values of n@xmath221 found for most of the samples except gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 ( n@xmath131 ) is expected below the anti - ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the fractional dependence of @xmath4 below t@xmath8 for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 can be attributed to the scattering of conduction electrons by critical spin fluctuations which begin to grow as one approaches t@xmath8 .",
    "such a behaviour has also been observed earlier in other gd based samples such as gd@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one clearly needs more studies on these compounds to try to understand their transport properties and clean single crystals would be helpful in doing so because it is well known that in ternary silicides and germanides the transport properties can be highly anisotropic and the overall behaviour for a polycrystalline sample can be easily influenced by this .",
    "the semiconducting behavior in the resistivity for the samples er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is interesting . in our recent report on the sample",
    "yb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 we had found a metallic resistivity in the same temperature range @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior in the transport properties has been observed in r@xmath1ru@xmath5ge@xmath6 @xcite and rbipt @xcite where the resistivity for all samples except yb showed a semiconducting response .",
    "however , one major difference between the behavior we observe is that there is no evidence for a gap or pseudogap as seen in these compounds since our data does not follow an activated behavior for @xmath4(t ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "15 where we have plotted ln(@xmath4 ) vs 1/t for the er , tm and lu sample in the region where we observe a semiconducting behavior . in this respect the @xmath4(t ) behavior for our samples is similar to that of urh@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite where a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity is found upto room temperature for some samples .",
    "we believe that like in the case of urh@xmath0ge@xmath0 , the anomalous resistivity behavior is arising due to crystallographic disorder which occurs due to inter - site exchange between ir and ge .",
    "further investigations are definitely required to understand this behavior .",
    "we could fit the high temperature dependence of @xmath4 to the parallel resistor model ( see table  5 ) successfully and the @xmath31 values obtained from such fits agree roughly with those obtained from heat - capacity data for almost all compounds ( magnetic or non - magnetic ) .",
    "the reasons for the difference of about 10 to 20% could be due to anharmonic contribution to the transport which is not considered in the parallel resistor model .",
    "the values of @xmath34 also vary considerably across the series and are quite high in some cases .",
    "thus it is clear that both the low temperature and the high temperature behaviour of the transport properties for these compounds require more investigations for a better understanding .",
    "the parameters obtained from the analysis of the heat capacity measurements can be found in table  6 where we have listed the values of the ordering temperature t@xmath8 , entropy s@xmath50(t@xmath8)/r , j , ln(2j+1 ) and s(30  k)/r . from the column giving values of",
    "s@xmath50(t@xmath8)/r one can see that for ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , tb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , the entropy just above the transition reaches a value which is close to @xmath58 indicating that the ground state for these compounds is a doublet .",
    "the entropy for ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 increases only weakely after the transition upto about 30  k indicating that the ground state doublet is well seperated from the excited crystal field levels .",
    "the entropy values at t@xmath8 for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 reach values of 1.01  r (  @xmath59  rln3 ) and 1.4  r (  @xmath59  rln4 ) respectively which indicates that the ground state is a triplet and a quartet for these systems respectively .",
    "the entropy at t@xmath8 for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is already 1.8  r and reaches almost the full 2.08  r at 30  k. the entropy at t@xmath8 for pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is unusually low at .05  r and is quite puzzling .",
    "the entropy reaches almost r  ln(3 ) at 10  k after the schottky anomaly which is peaked at 5  k. this would have been consistent with a nonmagnetic cef groundstate with a doublet forming the first excited state or maybe two singlets close together .",
    "however , we do see a magnetic transition in both the susceptibility and heat capacity measurements .",
    "the reason for this unusually small entropy at the transition is not understood at present .",
    "the entropy for most of the samples continues to rise above t@xmath8 , indicating the participation of excited crystal field levels in this temperature range , but reach values considerably reduced from the full r  ln(2  j+1 ) .    in general ,",
    "if cef effects are neglected , the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature t@xmath60 for a series of isostructural and isoelectronic metals are expected to scale ( de gennes scaling @xcite ) as ( g@xmath61@xmath621)@xmath32  j(j+1 ) where g@xmath61 is the lande g factor and j is the total angular momentum of the local moment .",
    "if the angular momentum is quenched then t@xmath8s are expected to scale as s(s+1 ) .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "16 is the dg factor ( g@xmath61  -  1)@xmath32  j(j+1 ) normalized to the value for gd .",
    "the dashed line is obtained by similar normalization for the case where the orbital angular momentum l is quenched and s is the good quantum number . from the fig .",
    "16 , it is evident that the ordering temperatures ( higest transition temperature for samples with multiple transitions ) of the compounds roughly follow the de gennes scaling ( g@xmath61 - 1)@xmath32  j(j+1 ) ) .",
    "the slight difference is probably due to cef effects which are quite strong as we saw in our heat capacity measurements .",
    "the fact that most of the compounds follow the de gennes scaling implies that the main interaction leading to the magnetic transitions in this series may be the rkky interaction .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the t@xmath8 for ce (  = 8.5  k ) is anomalously large compared to the other compounds .",
    "to conclude , we have synthesized and studied compounds of the series re@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 with re  =  y , la , ce - nd , gd - tm and lu using x - ray powder diffraction , magnetic susceptibity , isothermal magnetization , electrical resistivity and heat capacity measurements .",
    "we find that the structure changes from a tetragonal u@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 type structure for y , la and ce - dy to a new orthorhombic structure with space group pmmn for er - lu .",
    "the non - magnetic compounds la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 show superconductivity below 1.8  k and 2.4  k respectively while for the compound lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 indications for superconductivity could be seen in the resistivity and heat capacity measurements only . the absence of bulk superconductivity above 2  k for this compound may be attributed to the low density of states at the fermi level for the latter compound as indicated by the small value of the sommerfield s coefficient for this compound compared to the y and la compounds .",
    "all compounds containing magnetic rare - earth elements were found to give an estimated effective moment @xmath25@xmath63 close to the free ion re@xmath20 values and show magnetic ordering below 12  k or onset of magnetic order as in the case of tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 show multiple transitions apart from the main anti - ferromagnetic transition . the ordering temperature of ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 at 8.5",
    "k is anomalously high compared to the other compounds considering that gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 orders at 12  k. ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 shows a kondo - lattice behavior with a doublet ground state and moderate heavy electron behaviour .",
    "the t@xmath64 and t@xmath65 power law behaviour of the normal state @xmath4 data for la@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and y@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 respectively and the t@xmath56 and t@xmath57 power law dependence of the @xmath4 data in the paramagnetic state for pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is not understood at present .",
    "we find a semiconducting resistivity for the compounds er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and lu@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 which we believe is arising due to crystallographic disorder caused by an inter - site exchange between the ir and ge .",
    "the transport properties for this series of compounds clearly merits and requires further investigations on cleaner samples and preferably on single crystals to investigate the role of anisotropy on the overall behaviour of @xmath4 . from the temperature dependence of the entropy for the various compounds we have been able to establish that the ground state for the compounds ce@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 , tb@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and er@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is a doublet while the ground state for nd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and dy@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 is a triplet and a quartet respectively .",
    "we could also observe the complete octuplet for gd@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 .",
    "it was difficult to establish the ground states for the pr@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 and the tm@xmath0ir@xmath1ge@xmath2 compounds given that the latter compound does not order down to the lowest temperatures of our measurements and the former compound shows an anomalously low entropy above the magnetic transition .",
    "finally , the transition temperatures for most of the compounds scale with the de genne s factor indicating that the chief mechanism through which the magnetic moments interact may actually be the rkky type .",
