    "the accepted view of heavy - ion fusion reactions analyses , developed over the last several decades , is a combination of one - dimensional barrier penetration model , described by an appropriate  bare \" optical potential , augmented by couplings to important channels whose coupling with the entrance channel is required to account for the data @xcite .",
    "the choice of the bare potential is important as it sets the stage for a critical assessment of the importance of including the coupling to non - elastic channels in the calculation of the fusion cross section and confronting this with the data .",
    "this is most pronounced at energies in the vicinity of the height of the coulomb barrier , where tunneling is dominant . at higher energies",
    "the fusion cross section follows a simple geometrical form , with a linear dependence on the inverse of the collision energy in the centre of mass frame , @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of the bare potential is also important as it dictates the angular and the linear coefficients of this 1/e dependence ( see sec .",
    "iii ) .    coupled channels effects on the fusion cross section at high energies manifest themselves in the form of an average energy loss . when the energy is increased further ,",
    "many channels become open in the region of the so - called deep inelastic reactions , and the fusion cross section starts decreasing after reaching a maximum . in this same region competition with breakup reactions",
    "become important .",
    "this is the accepted scenario of the fusion of tightly bound nuclei which was under experimental scrutiny over many decades now .    at near or below barrier energies the fusion of these tightly bound nuclei is dictated by tunneling and the effect of",
    "the coupling to collective degrees of freedom in the participating nuclei is most important , giving rise to great enhancement of the sub - barrier fusion when compared to that calculated with just the one - channel , bare potential .",
    "the low energy fusion of weakly bound projectiles is more challenging as the effect of the coupling to the breakup channel even at near barrier energies is very important and yet quite difficult to calculate precisely with available coupled channels codes such as the continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) one  @xcite .",
    "in such a situation one relies heavily on a comparison with the data of a very precise calculation of the fusion cross section which takes into account all the important bound non - elastic channels using an appropriate bare optical potential . the difference with the data",
    "is then attributed to the effect of the coupling to the breakup channels .",
    "it then becomes very clear how important the choice of the bare potential is .",
    "a poor choice can lead to conflicting conclusions especially in the case of halo nuclei such as @xmath1he .",
    "there are several bare potentials which are used in the near - barrier fusion analysis .",
    "the most frequently used ones are briefly discussed below .    1",

    "microscopic - inspired double folding bare potential + the double folding form of the bare potential is inspired by a low - energy version of multiple scattering theory , with due respect given to medium modifications .",
    "its general form is , + @xmath3 + where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the densities of the projectile and the target , respectively .",
    "the interaction @xmath6 is a configuration version of the bruckner g - matrix  @xcite .",
    "the well known choice is the m3y interaction  @xcite .",
    "a version of the double folding potential which takes into account the effect of pauli non - locality in @xmath6 is the so paulo ( sp ) potential  @xcite , which has been used extensively in recent years in the analysis of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it relies on the single folding potential of nucleon - nucleus interaction , with appropriate use of the non - locality ala perey - perey and buck and perey  @xcite .",
    "the single folding potential is then folded into the density of the projectile .",
    "this gives the following form of the so paulo potential , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the local relative velocity .",
    "the so paulo potential at near - barrier energies reduces to the double folding one , as the non - locality factor @xmath9 $ ] becomes insignificant in this regime .",
    "the merit of the so paulo bare potential resides in the fact that the double folding integral is evaluated exactly with any kind of density .",
    "the akyz - winther potential + this bare potential is an approximation of the double folding interaction which supplies an analytical form .",
    "it invloves the use of a fermi - type functions for the densities and the m3y interaction .",
    "the double folding integral is then evaluated .",
    "the potential for a broad range of systems are then approximated by the ws functions , + @xmath10\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp{[\\kappa ( r - r)]}},\\ ] ] + where @xmath11 and @xmath12   { \\rm fm } , \\ \\ ( i={\\rm p } , { \\rm t}),\\\\ % \\kappa & = & \\left[1.16 + 0.56\\left(\\frac{1}{a_{p}^{1/3 } } + \\frac{1}{a_{t}^{1/3}}\\right)\\right ]   { \\rm fm}^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + the aw bare potential is a very convenient interaction as it has an analytic form , with parameters given for any nuclear system and thus easy to use in reaction calculation .",
    "the proximity potential + the proximity ( prox ) potential  @xcite is based on the approximation that the diffuseness of the nuclear surface is much smaller than the radius .",
    "this is the case for leptodermic systems . as such one can approximate the interaction between the projectile and the target at small separation by that of two slabs of nuclear matter in the sense , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the interaction per unit area of two semi - infinite surfaces at the distance @xmath15 .",

    "nevertheless we will use the proximity potential in the comparison with the sp and the aw ones , in the next section .",
    "the comparison among the three bare potentials , the proximity , the sp , and the aw , will serve as a benchmark for our discussion of the fusion cross section of loosely bound nuclei .",
    "in this section we look at the coulomb barriers resulting from the bare potentials of the previous section and at their influence on the fusion cross sections . as an example , we consider the barriers for the @xmath25o + @xmath26pb system .",

    "they differ by their height and also by their widths .",

    "clearly there are important differences in parameters associated with each of the bare potentials considered in our discussion .    in situations where two potentials produce very different barriers ,",
    "one expects significant differences in the resulting fusion cross section . to check this point",
    ", we investigate the theoretical cross sections obtained with the above bare potentials for two systems : @xmath1he + @xmath35u and @xmath41he + @xmath33bi .",
    "the barrier parameters associated with each of these potentials are considerably different , specially for the latter system .",

    "we notice clearly significant differences among the calculation with the three bare potentials .",
    "in particular the @xmath41he case , the differences are indeed quite large . the fusion cross sections of the borromean nucleus @xmath1he calculated with the sp and the proximity potential are close , but that obtained with the aw is much lower .",
    "obviously in coupled channels analysis of fusion , the conclusions concerning the importance of the coupling is intimately related to the bare potential employed .",

    ". however , reliable coupled channel calculations for the @xmath41he+@xmath33bi system can easily be performed and the predictions of each bare potential can be compared with the experiment .",

    "there are different proposals to reach this goal .",
    "a convenient one is to transform the cross sections into fusion functions , which depend on a dimensionless variable associated with the collision energy .",
    "one carries out the transformations  @xcite : @xmath43 if coupled channel effects can be neglected and wong s approximation  @xcite for the cross section holds , one obtains the universal fusion function ( uff ) , @xmath44 } .",
    "\\label{uff}\\ ] ] for light systems ( @xmath45 ) wong s approximation is poor at sub - barrier energies .",
    "however , this approximation is much better above the barrier and the fusion functions are always close to the uff in this energy region .",
    "it is important to stress that the transformations of eq .",
    "( [ fusfun ] ) depend on the barrier parameters of the bare potential .",
    "usually , channel coupling effects have a major influence on the fusion cross section at sub - barrier energies .",
    "however , frequently , this influence is not so strong above the barrier .",
    "thus , if the bare potential is correctly chosen , the experimental fusion function , obtained using the experimental cross section in eq .",
    "( [ fusfun ] ) , should be close to the uff .",
    "that is , @xmath46        we use a similar procedure to compare the cross sections of fig .",
    "[ om_crossec ] in terms of fusion functions .",
    "we consider the same systems and use the barrier parameters of the sp potential to carry out the reduction .",
    "the fusion functions associated with theoretical cross sections obtained by single channel calculations with the aw and proximity potentials are shown in fig .",
    "[ reduced_om ] .",
    "we leave out the fusion function associated with the sp potential itself , because it is almost indistinguishable from the uff .",
    "this is because wong s approximation is very accurate in the above - barrier region shown in detail in the figure .",
    "if the aw and the proximity potentials were equivalent to the sp one , their fusion functions would also be very close to the uff .",
    "we see clearly the sensitivity of @xmath47 to the bare potential employed . in the @xmath41he case ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath47 with the aw bare potential is close to the uff , while @xmath47 calculated with the proximity bare potential it is quite different from uff .",
    "the situation is inverted in the @xmath1he fusion case . here",
    "the aw bare potential gives a @xmath47 much lower than the uff , while the proximity potential is practically identical with the uff .",
    "this finding only strengthens our argument that there is great sensitivity of near - barrier fusion to the bare potential .",
    "a bad choice of the bare potential may lead to wrong conclusions about the behavior of @xmath48 .    what causes the differences among the bare potentials used in this paper ?",
    "we believe the major difference resides in the fact that the sp potential , which is the double folding interaction with realistic densities , is more faithful in catching the essentials of the nucleus - nucleus interaction .",
    "in fact , it is based on experimentally determined densities and there are no approximations involved , in contrast to the aw potential , which uses an analytical form of these densities , and employs further approximations to allow an analytical evaluation of the double folding integral .",
    "the proximity potential , being constructed for epidermic systems , with diffuseness much smaller than the radius of a given nucleus , is reasonable for the heavy targets considered , but fails for the light projectile .",
    "the systems studied in the previous figures have very unusual densities . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath32he is a very compact nucleus whereas the density of @xmath34he is influenced by the two neutron halo . to illustrate this point",
    ", we compare the experimental densities of @xmath34he  @xcite , used in the sp potential , with a gaussian density that does not include the contribution of the halo .",
    "this schematic density is given by a gaussian normalised by the condition @xmath49 and with r.m.s .",
    "radius corresponding to that of @xmath32he scaled by the factor @xmath50 , as in ref .",
    "the two densities are compared in fig .",
    "[ densities-6he ] ( a ) .",
    "they are indeed very different .",
    "the fusion cross sections obtained with the sp potential using these densities are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ densities-6he ] ( b ) .",
    "as expected , the cross sections are considerably different .",
    "this clearly shows the importance of using realistic densities in the calculation of the bare potential .",
    "attempts have been made to infer the parameters of the bare potential using fusion cross section measurements at above - barrier energies ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "if one uses the classical approximation for the transmission factor , @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the height of the barrier of the effective potential at the angular momentum @xmath53 , the partial - wave series can easily be evaluated .",
    "one then gets the fusion cross section , @xmath54 , \\label{classical_xsec}\\ ] ] with @xmath55 .",
    "thus , plotting @xmath48 vs. @xmath56 , the barrier height and radius can be immediately obtained from the interceptions of the straight line with the two axis .",
    "it intercepts the @xmath56 axis at @xmath57 and the @xmath48 axis at @xmath58 .    before further discussions of this procedure",
    ", one has to decide how much above the barrier one should take the data . above some critical energy ,",
    "the highest angular momenta should be excluded from the partial - wave summation .",
    "this is because at these angular momenta the effective optical potential , @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 standing respectively for the bare nuclear potential and the coulomb interaction , does not have a pocket .",
    "thus the projectile can not be captured and fusion does not take place .",
    "the fusion cross section is then in another energy regime , where it does not have a linear dependence on @xmath56 . on the other hand , at energies just above the barrier ,",
    "the classical approximation for the transmission factor is inaccurate . to choose the energy region where the cross section has the desired linear behavior",
    ", one should compare the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ classical_xsec ] ) with its quantum mechanical counterpart . in order to get a system independent answer",
    ", we make this comparison using reduced cross sections .",
    "that is , we compare the uff with its high energy limit , where tunnelling effects can be neglected .",
    "it can be easily checked that at high enough energies ( @xmath62 ) eq .",
    "( [ uff ] ) can be approximated by its limit , @xmath63        in fig .",

    "although these effects are much more important below the coulomb barrier , they may affect the cross section at above - barrier energy . in this case",
    ", the parameter extracted from the cross section would be associated with some sort of effective barrier without any practical utility .",
    "thus , the influence of channel couplings above the barrier should be checked .    as a first step , we consider the trivial case of the @xmath25o+@xmath67sm system , where these effects are known to be very weak . in fig .",
