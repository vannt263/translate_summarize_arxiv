    "it is well - known that the radiation properties of atoms can dramatically be manipulated by changing the environment where atoms emit photons . for micro - cavities",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite and for periodic dielectric media predicted @xcite that a suppression of spontaneous emission ( se ) can be achieved . in the case of a micro - cavity",
    "this happens because its geometry reduces the radiation - mode density , whereas in a periodic dielectric medium se is suppressed due to the formation of photonic band gaps ( pbg ) .",
    "the recent achievement of bose - einstein condensation in magnetic traps @xcite has provided a new state of matter where all atoms share a single macroscopic quantum state .",
    "such a state of matter offers great opportunities to explore and test new phenomena related to macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "recently several authors have theoretically studied spontaneous emission in a trapped bec . in this case",
    "the continuous center - of - mass momentum distribution leads to an increase of se @xcite .",
    "in addition , the stimulated emission can be increased by the bose enhancement in a bec @xcite . in the case of two becs , interference effects can be important @xcite .",
    "the present work is focused on the case of an extended bec and was motivated by the following idea .",
    "if an extended bec is placed in an optical lattice it will become periodic .",
    "since such a bec does provide a ( quantum ) dielectric it affects the properties of photons propagating through it and phenomena similar to pbgs do occur @xcite .",
    "since then the photon mode density around the resonance frequency is reduced one can expect that se is suppressed by non - markovian effects .",
    "we thus are led to the following question : can a bec in an optical lattice stabilize itself against spontaneous emission ?    a large part of this paper",
    "is devoted to the answer of this question .",
    "however , we also have studied what will happen for a homogeneous extended bec interacting with a weak running laser beam .",
    "surprisingly , non - markovian effects similar to that in a pbg do occur even in this non - periodic situation .",
    "this happens because in the presence of such a bec photons and excited atoms do form superpositions called polaritons @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of these polaritons contains an avoided crossing which has a similar effect on the se rate as a pbg .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the heisenberg equations of motion for the photon annihilation operators @xmath9 and the field operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 for excited and ground - state atoms can be derived easily and are given by @xmath12 we have neglected the interatomic interaction terms .    to address the question of self - stabilization",
    "consider the following situation : the atoms in the internal ground - state have formed a bec which is described by a macroscopically occupied coherent collective wavefunction @xmath13 .",
    "they interact with a traveling wave or standing wave laser which is described by a coherent c - number field @xmath14 .",
    "due to this interaction a part of the bec is coherently excited .",
    "we denote the wavefunction for coherently excited atoms by @xmath15 . since both the ground - state bec and the laser beam are described by c - number fields it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ edgl ] ) that @xmath15 must be a c - number field , too .",
    "it is only through the spontaneous decay of these coherently excited atoms that q - number deviations from c - number solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ edgl ] ) to ( [ adgl ] ) can appear .",
    "the corresponding se rate determines the stability of the macroscopic solution .",
    "let us start with the assumption that the bec can indeed stabilize itself against se .",
    "in that case a stationary macroscopic solution @xmath16 of eqs .",
    "( [ edgl ] ) to ( [ adgl ] ) should exist .",
    "the problem then can be divided into two separate parts .",
    "we first search for the stationary macroscopic coherent solution which includes all interaction effects between atoms and photons beside se . having found this solution we can perform a stability analysis to analyze the quantum fluctuations ( se ) around it .",
    "spontaneous decay will make the coherent solution unstable and the corresponding quantum corrections will become important on a time scale comparable to the atomic lifetime ( which is to be calculated ) . for times shorter than this lifetime the deviations from the coherent solution will be small ( i.e. , there are only few non - condensed atoms and non - laser photons ) .    given a stationary macroscopic solution of the heisenberg equations of motion the stability analysis can be performed by applying bogoliubov s method .",
    "this is done by writing the quantum field operators in the form @xmath17 \\ { \\psi_g^{\\mbox{{\\scriptsize coh } } }     ( \\vec{k } ) + \\delta \\psi_g(\\vec{k } ) \\ } \\label{fluctg } \\\\",

    "the linearized equations are valid as long as the photon - atom quantum fluctuations remain small enough , i.e. , there are only few non - condensed atoms and non - laser photons .",

    "we thus have neglected all terms in which these quantities do appear .",
    "in addition , we have introduced two specific polarization vectors for the electromagnetic field .",
    "a `` non - coupled '' polarization vector @xmath29 , which is perpendicular to the photon momentum @xmath30 and the atomic dipole moment @xmath7 , and a coupled polarization vector @xmath31 , which is perpendicular to @xmath30 and @xmath32 ( see fig .  [ polvecs ] ) . since the interaction is proportional to the scalar product of the polarization vector and @xmath7 only electromagnetic modes with polarization @xmath33 do interact with the atoms .",
    "we associate with these modes the quantum fluctuation operator @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to see that the scalar product @xmath35 , which appears in the definition of @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angle between @xmath30 and @xmath7 . for notational convenience",

    "the stability analysis essentially comprises to solve the time evolution of the polariton modes for relatively short times during which the occupation of the macroscopic coherent solution does not change very much .",
    "this will allow us to derive the initial se rate of coherently excited atoms .",

    "to do so we have to find closed expressions for the polariton eigenfrequencies @xmath75 and the functions @xmath76 in order to derive @xmath77 . these quantities in turn require the knowledge of both the polariton eigenmodes and the fields @xmath78 comprising the macroscopic coherent solution . since the calculations leading to a closed expression for @xmath65 are quite involved we present them in the appendices . in the next two sections we analyse the results and give physical interpretations of the effects involved",
    "in the case of a bec interacting with a traveling wave laser , the polariton dispersion relation derived in appendix [ polaritoneigenmodesrun ] does contain an avoided crossing around the resonance frequency of the atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ avoidedcrossing ] ) . since nearly resonant photons provide the dominant contribution to se , it is physically evident that this avoided crossing in the dispersion spectrum will produce an effect on the se rate which is similar to what a pbg can do .",
    "this effect can be studied by analysing the closed expression for the renormalized value of @xmath77 which we have derived using the generalized wigner - weisskopf approximation presented in appendix [ derivationofirun ] .",

    "hence , the magnitude of non - markovian effects is essentially determined by the ratio @xmath92 this ratio is proportional to the total number of excited atoms divided by the number of condensed ground - state atoms per optical wavelength @xmath93 .",
    "the request that this ratio should be small has important consequences when applied to becs of a density in the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the bec - induced effects can only be relevant if there are very few coherently excited atoms ( in the order of one ) .",

    "<S> an extended bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in an optical lattice provides a kind of periodic dielectric and causes band gaps to occur in the spectrum of light propagating through it . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the question whether these band gaps can modify the spontaneous emission rate of atoms excited from the bec , and whether they can lead to a self - stabilization of the bec against spontaneous emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that self - stabilization is not possible for becs with a density in the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the corresponding non - markovian behavior produces significant effects in the decay of excited atoms even for a homogeneous bec interacting with a weak laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are caused by the occurrence of an avoided crossing in the photon ( or rather polariton ) spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict a new channel for spontaneous decay which arises from an interference between periodically excited atoms and periodic photon modes . </S>",
    "<S> this new channel should also occur in ordinary periodic dielectrics .    </S>",
