    "despite their rarity , it is the exotic creatures that attract the crowds at the zoo ; similarly the exotic objects in the stellar zoo attract our attention .",
    "unusual environments often lead to relatively large populations of the exotic .",
    "so it is with the cores of the galactic globular cluster ( ggcs ) , which have long been thought to harbor a variety of exotic objects  blue stragglers , low mass x - ray binaries , cataclysmic variables , millisecond pulsars , etc .",
    "most of these objects are thought to result from various kinds of binary systems whose nature and even existence can be strongly affected by dynamics in the dense cluster cores .    when a binary system contains a compact object ( like a neutron star or white dwarf ) and a close enough secondary , mass transfer can take place .",
    "the streaming gas , its impact on the compact object , or the presense of an accretion disk can give such systems observational signatures which make them stand out above ordinary cluster stars .",
    "these signatures might include x - ray emission , significant radiation in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , emission lines , or rapid time variations .",
    "the first evidence for such objects in globular clusters was the discovery of x - ray sources .",
    "one population of x - ray sources with @xmath1 ( the so - called low mass x - ray binaries , lmxb ) are thought to be binary systems with an accreting neutron star because of their x - ray bursts .",
    "lmxbs are very overabundant ( a factor 100 ) in ggcs with respect to the field , presumably because the high stellar density has led to many capture binaries .    given the existence of neutron star systems in ggcs one might expect to find many more analogous systems involving white dwarfs ( wds ) . in the field , binary systems",
    "in which a wd is accreting material from a late type dwarf , i.e. , a main sequence or subgiant star , are observed cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "cvs are well - studied objects in the field , where they are thought to form by the evolution of primordial binaries .",
    "they come in many varieties depending on stellar masses , mass transfer rates , magnetic field strength , etc . in ggcs",
    "one can expect even more variety because cvs located in dense clusters could have been created by dynamical processes ( hut & verbunt , 1983 , bailyn 1995 ) , while the cvs in low - density clusters result from primordial binary systems ( verbunt & meylan 1988 ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , distefano & rappaport 1994 ) suggest that @xmath2 white dwarf binaries might be found in massive clusters like 47  tuc and @xmath3  cen , and several 10 s in more typical clusters . despite the expectation of large numbers of cv like stars ,",
    "searches have turned up only a relatively small number .",
    "of course , part of the problem arises because of the difficulty of search for rather faint objects in crowded globular cluster fields .",
    "however , exploiting the high resolution of _ hst _ , it has become possible to search ggc centers for several of the anticipated cv signatures .",
    "still the number of candidates is small :    * more than 30 low luminosity x - ray sources with @xmath4 ( hereafter llgcxs ) have been discovered in 19 ggcs ( johnston & verbunt 1994 ) . despite their relatively large numbers there is no consensus model for llgcxs ( see verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) and hasinger , johnston & verbunt 1996 ) .",
    "the fainter llgcxs ( @xmath5 ) might well be associated with cvs ( van paradijs ( 1983 ) , hertz & grindlay , 1983 ) .",
    "* there are three objects connected with conventionally detected cvs : a dwarf nova in m5 ( margon , downes & gunn 1981 ) ; hst uv detections of optical counterparts to a dwarf nova in 47 tuc ( paresce & demarchi 1994 ) and possibly the historical nova in m80 ( shara & drissen 1995 ) * using _ hst _ , h@xmath6 emission has been observed from three objects in ngc 6397 ( cool et al .",
    "1995 ) , and two objects in ngc 6752 ( bailyn et al . 1996 ) . * also using _ hst _ , a number of candidate cvs have been selected on the basis of uv excess and variability : the einstein dim source in 47 tuc ( paresce , de marchi & ferraro 1992 ) and few cvs candidates in ngc 6624 ( sosin & cool 1995 ) .",
    "we are involved in two long - term hst projects to study in detail the evolved populations in a sample of ggcs , at different wavelengths ranging from the uv to the near ir .",
    "although we were not specifically hunting for cvs , we have used the uv exposures to search for exotic objects in the core of ggcs .",
    "this search has been very fruitful : in our data - base ( 9 clusters ) we have found in _ all ggcs properly observed ( with exposures deep enough and in the right uv bands ) there is at least one faint object with a strong uv excess with respect to the main stellar population of the cluster)_. these stars are brighter in the uv than in the visible , so we will refer to them as uv - dominant ( uvd ) .",
    "we wish to carefully distinguish between these objects and objects which are called ` uv - excess ' objects on the basis of their colors in the visible or perhaps near uv .",
    "previously we have reported on three uvd stars in the ggc m13 ( ferraro et al .",
    "two of these objects have been found to lie within the error boxes of llgcxs ( fox et al .",
    "1996 ) , and we argue that they are excellent cv candidates . here",

    "the psf - fitting procedure was then performed on each individual frame separately and the instrumental magnitudes were then averaged .",

    "1997 , see also figure 4 in verbunt & hasinger 1998 ) indicating that the x - ray luminosity of objects found in ggcs is high relative to the visible compared to similar objects in the field .",

    "( 1997 ) used the high @xmath66 value of t  sco in m80 to argue that it was not associated with the candidate object suggested by shara & drissen .",

    "these are the dq  her systems v1223  sgr , ao  psc and tv  col .",
    "these are strongly magnetic cvs of a class referred to as intermediate polars ( ip ) .",
    "grindlay ( 1999 ) suggests that ips might dominate the rosat survey since they are expected to have a ratio @xmath67 greater than non - magnetic cvs .",
    "the problem with connecting the uvd stars with magnetic cvs is that the magnetic field might truncate the inner portion of the accretion disk ( grindlay 1999 ) .",
    "thus , mcvs might not be expected to have strong uv - excess .",
    "it is worth noting that the v97 @xmath24 distributions for field dwarf novae ( su  uma , z  cam , u  gem stars ) are based on small samples ( 11 , 7 , 7 ) and still span one to two orders of magnitudes .",
    "larger samples could well reach into the range observed in ggcs . indeed ,",
    "since we could well be observing the bright end of a sample of several tens of assorted types of cvs in a ggc , the large observed values of @xmath24 probably do not provide a significant constraint on cv types .",
    "perhaps the most solid detection of cvs in a ggc are those in ngc  6397 ( edmonds  1999 ; c98 ) .",
    "there are several indications of mass exchange : h@xmath6 emission , x - ray radiation , spectra with emission lines , and time variability or flickering of the optical radiation .",
    "the colors of these objects become redder as the wavelength of filters employed increases .",
    "this suggests in , for example , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the light from the cool secondary dominates a rather weak accretion disk .",
    "this is one of the factors which led edmonds  ( 1999 ) and grindlay ( 1999 ) to associate these objects with the intermediate polar class of magnetic cv .",
    "the cvs in ngc  6752 are probably similar objects .",
    "the uvd objects are clearly not this sort of creature .",
    "many have properties one might expect from a generic cv , i.e. , white dwarf / main sequence binaries with some mass exchange .",
    "they share many properties with some field cvs  x - ray luminosity , uv colors , absolute visual magnitudes .",
    "the facts that they tend to lie at the extremes of the distributions and that some do not have detected x - radiation may simply be a consequence of the rather low sensitivity of current surveys . in this scenario",
    "the difference between the uv dominant cvs and those in ngc  6397 is simply a matter of the relative importance of light from the secondary and the accretion disk . for the ggc uvd stars , as with most cvs in the field",
    ", the accretion disk significantly outshines the secondary star ( see for example figure 2.162.17 in warner 1995 ) .",
    "what other options are there ? it might be tempting to extend either the horizontal branch ( hb ) or white dwarf ( wd ) sequences into the region of the uvd stars .",
    "however , the hb terminates at the helium burning main sequence . particularly for m13",
    "where the observed hb extends almost to its termination , we see that the uvd stars are significantly fainter ( figure  1 of ferraro  1997 ) .",
    "the ordinary , i.e. , carbon / oxygen , wd sequence is well observed , for instance , in m  4 and all the observed wds are fainter than @xmath68 ( see figure 6 by richer et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath69 mag .",
    "fainter than the faintest uvd in table 2 .",
    "so the uvd stars are not hb stars or carbon / oxygen white dwarfs .",
    "edmonds  ( 1999 ) have shown that at least one uvd star is not a cv .",
    "their _ hst_-fos spectrum of one of the nf - uv objects identified by c98 in ngc  6397 suggests a very hot high gravity object .",
    "they argue that this is a low mass ( @xmath70 ) helium white dwarf .",
    "such an object could arise from either mass exchange in a binary system shortly after the primary leaves the main sequence or via stellar collisions .",
    "the object has a velocity of @xmath71 relative to the cluster cvs which is most easily explained if it still is in a binary system with a dark companion .",
    "( it might be worth noting that ngc  6397 is a post - core - collapse cluster with a very dense core , whereas the uvd objects we have found are in the moderate density clusters m13 & m92 . )",
    "could he wds account for all ggc uvd stars ?",
    "this is certainly not the case for the objects in m5 , m80 , & 47  tuc which have shown variability consistent with known cv types .",
    "he wds would not produce x - rays in significant quantities .",
    "the chance association of three llgcxs with such rare objects as the uvd objects we have found in m13 & m92 would seem unlikely .",
    "we have now identified three uv dominant objects which appear to be associated with x - ray sources in the ggcs m13 and m92 .",
    "we argue that these are generically cvs , i.e. , white dwarf / main sequence binaries with some mass exchange .",
    "they share many properties with some field cvs  x - ray luminosity , uv colors , absolute visual magnitudes  although they tend to lie at the extremes of the distributions .",
    "the relatively high optical , uv , & x - ray luminosities are consistent with the notion that current surveys do not reach deep enough to detect most of the cvs in ggcs . on the other hand ,",
    "cluster cvs are older and live in a dramatically different environment from their sisters in the field .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable that cluster objects might be a new class of cvs with properties which slightly differ from those in the field .",
    "the cvs found in ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 differ significantly from our objects . some of these have little or no uv excess .",
    "this should not be surprising .",
    "the searches in ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 relied on h@xmath6 and @xmath72 band , whereas we used the uv .",
    "there is considerable variety in the properties of field cvs and no reason to suspect less variety in ggc cvs .",
    "different search techniques operating at the margin of detectability will certainly turn up different kinds of objects .",
    "the uvd objects in ggcs probably come in several varieties .",
    "( our ggc projects do not seem to come up with simple answers . )",
    "edmonds  ( 1999 ) have shown that one is a hot high gravity object , arguablly a he - wd .",
    "still we suspect that most of these will turn out to be cvs , and that many uvd objects with no x - radiation detected to date will show up as llgcxs in more sensitive x - ray surveys .",
    "this suspicion is fueled by the belief that a significant population of generic cvs must be present in ggcs .",
    "we have yet to make an observation directly showing the hot diffuse gas which would be the definitive evidence that our uvd objects are cvs .",
    "hst stis spectra could give such evidence .",
    "it would be extremely valuable to develop a technique to identify ggc cvs using uv photometry .",
    "cluster cores are very congested in the red and h@xmath6/@xmath72 band searches will obviously be incomplete because of the interference by bright red giants ( see figure  2 of bailyn 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand the core of even the densest clusters are relatively open in the uv ( see figure  1 of ferraro 1999b )    this research was partially supported by the _ agenzia spaziale italiana _ ( asi ) and by the murst as part of the project _ dynamics and stellar evolution in globular clusters_. f. r. f. acknowledges the _ eso visiting program _ for the hospitality .",
