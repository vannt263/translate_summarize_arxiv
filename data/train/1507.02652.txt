    "self - similar behavior is ubiquitous in physics .",
    "it emerges for example in condensed matter systems near criticality @xcite , in biological systems @xcite as well as in complex networks @xcite . systems with this property",
    "`` look the same '' under a rescaling of characteristic length and/or time scales .",
    "this property often entails a drastic reduction of the details that are necessary for a theoretical description , such as specific parameter values or initial conditions .",
    "self - similar behavior can also occur in cold atomic ensembles , currently used as an experimental platform for exploring fundamental questions of far - from - equilibrium physics such as the approach of interacting many - body systems to ( thermal ) equilibrium @xcite .",
    "for example , self - similar behavior is predicted for the relaxation of a gas of quenched bose - condensed atoms as a consequence of the existence of non - thermal fixed points @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is argued @xcite that many of these characteristics were also present during the evolution of the early universe leading to the idea of using cold atomic systems as analogue systems for addressing problems of relevance to cosmology or particle physics .",
    "in this work we introduce a simple far - from - equilibrium scenario in which a non - trivial relaxation dynamics is driven by power - law interactions .",
    "the motivation stems from recent experiments in the domain of cold atom physics which explore the laser excitation of atoms to high - lying electronic states in which they interact with power - law potentials . while complementary , the scenario we study below has analogies with that of the above - mentioned work on bose - condensed gases @xcite .",
    "in particular , evolution which is initially fast and uncorrelated is succeeded by slow and strongly correlated self - similar growth .",
    "we show that the physics of this dynamics is governed by an effective particle deposition process where the rates depend on the distance to other deposited particles as a power - law .",
    "the scale - invariant nature of the deposition dynamics is revealed analytically and confirmed numerically by means of extensive numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , we show that the relaxation dynamics crosses over into a mean - field regime when the power - law exponent becomes equal to the system dimension . beyond providing an understanding of non - equilibrium processes governed by power - law interactions",
    "our results reveal new insights into the relaxation behavior of gases of interacting rydberg atoms , which are currently widely employed for the experimental study of many - body phenomena @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the characteristic minimal distance between rydberg excitations  which is often referred to as blockade radius  is not generally a static quantity but can in the presence of dissipation acquire a non - trivial scale - invariant time - dependence .",
    "the dynamical problem we study below emerges from considering a collection of @xmath0 atoms on a cubic lattice in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "each atom is described with two levels , a ground state and the excited rydberg state , denoted as @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "atoms in the rydberg state at positions @xmath4 and @xmath5 interact through a power - law potential @xmath6 with exponent @xmath7 , while the much weaker interactions involving atoms in the ground state are neglected .",
    "typically encountered exponents are @xmath8 ( van der waals interaction ) and @xmath9 ( dipolar interaction ) @xcite . the atomic states @xmath3 and @xmath2 are resonantly coupled by a laser field and at the same time subject to strong dissipation which leads to the rapid dephasing of superposition states , e.g. @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by a ( classical ) spin - flip dynamics in which a change in the state of site @xmath11 , whether an excitation @xmath12 or a de - excitation @xmath13 , occurs with an ( operator - valued ) rate ( see ref .",

    "the term @xmath19 strongly correlates the atoms , giving rise to a slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity ( within a distance of the order of @xmath15 ) of an excited atom . in this sense , the dynamics is affected by kinetic constraints of the type that are usually considered in simplified models of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "this description of the rydberg gas dynamics has been recently used in a number of theoretical works @xcite and was also successfully employed to model experiments @xcite . a similar perturbative approach to the derivation of effective dynamics in the limit of strong dissipation was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider an empty initial state , @xmath20 .",
    "one key observation that greatly helps to simplify the following analysis is that excitation processes @xmath12 strongly dominate over de - excitations @xmath13 , as will be shown below .",
    "thus , the effective reversible dynamics is in essence a pure ( and irreversible ) _ deposition process _ ( where @xmath13 is not allowed ) governed by the following master equation @xmath21 \\ket{p(t)}. \\label{deposition_eq}\\ ] ] the state is given by the vector @xmath22 , with @xmath23 denoting the probability of finding a specific configuration of excitations @xmath24 at time @xmath25 .",
    "the operator @xmath26 creates an excitation at site @xmath11 , or  in the deposition picture  deposits a particle in site @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the concentration of excitations @xmath27 as a function of time for the case of @xmath9 .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) [ 1d chain and a 2d square lattice , respectively ] that irreversible deposition processes indeed dominate the growth regime , similar to what was suggested recently in ref .",
    "deviations become apparent in the long - time limit when the system approaches its stationary state : for the reversible process this is the fully random state , @xmath28 , while for the deposition process it is the ( absorbing ) state of a full lattice , @xmath29 .",
    "note , that in the case of rydberg gases this long - time limit will typically not be achieved due to the finite lifetime of excited atoms .",
    "however , while a finite decay rate eventually makes the system settle into a nonequilibrium stationary state , the initial phases of the growth dynamics are well within the reach of current experiments , and they turn out to be virtually indistinguishable from those observed without decay , according to both numerical @xcite and experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "in the strongly correlated regime , i.e. when the interparticle distance becomes smaller than @xmath15 , the deposition process is amenable to an approximate analytical treatment .",
    "this is most transparently explained in 1d : consider two excitations in a 1d chain separated by distance @xmath30 .",
    "then the next excitation will be deposited with very high likelihood at ( essentially ) a distance @xmath31 from the two existing excitations , effectively rescaling the inter - excitation distance by the factor @xmath32 .",
    "the reason for this is that the deposition rate is highly peaked at the mid point between two excitations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "the process continues until the natural cutoff scale  the lattice spacing @xmath18  is reached , which makes further subdivision impossible .",
    "a similar process is expected to occur in 2d , where the same reasoning , starting for example from a square of excitations , can be applied with a rescaling constant @xmath33 [ see fig . [ fig1](d ) ] . that the actual dynamics indeed follows a rescaling behavior",

    "the scale - invariance of the deposition dynamics is revealed analytically and confirmed by means of extensive numerical simulations of the original problem ( without de - excitations ) .",
    "our results indicate that the blockade radius acquires a scale - invariant time - dependence in the presence of dissipation .",
    "moreover , we study how the dynamics depends on the exponent of the interactions , and show a crossover into a mean - field regime when the power - law exponent becomes equal to the dimensions of the lattice or smaller .    despite the evident differences in the underlying physical models , it is worthy of mention that a scale - invariant dynamics has also been theoretically established in observables characterizing domain growth and phase ordering in classical models of magnetism that have been quenched from a disordered phase to an ordered phase , even in the absence of power - law interactions @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , this is another setting in which the dynamics can be thought of as a deposition process .",
    "it is not clear to us whether deeper relations between that problem and the one that concerns us here exist ( though the fact that the power - law exponents differ speaks against the use of conventional universality arguments ) .",
    "whether connections to problems studied in the past are eventually found or not , the presented out - of - equilibrium setting is probably one of the simplest manifestations of a many - body evolution governed by power - law rates , and therefore we expect that a similar dynamics may be observed in systems of quite a different nature than the dissipative rydberg gases that inspired its study . in view of the experimental realization through rydberg atoms",
    "it is interesting to ask how much of the observed features actually persists in the quantum regime , i.e. when the strong noise condition is lifted . while computationally unfeasible this could very well be explored in the most recent generation of experiments , e.g. @xcite .    _",
