    "recently , the proposals @xcite of manipulating spin currents by an electric field via spin hall effect ( she ) have attracted a lot of attention , in which studies have been mainly focused on non - interacting or weakly interacting semiconductor systems with substantial spin - orbit ( so ) coupling . due to the so coupling ,",
    "an applied electric field can induce intrinsic spin hall currents in a transverse direction , which can be well separated from the dissipative charge currents along the longitudinal direction .",
    "but the intrinsic she in an so system is usually very sensitive to disorder @xcite because the spin polarization is tied to momentum and the spin current is not conserved . without the conservation law ,",
    "the spin hall conductivity studied in the linear response theory generally may not be directly connected to physical spin accumulations in such so systems sheng , zhang , and a disorder effect can drastically affect the latter , leading to the debate whether an intrinsic she can meaningfully exist in realistic systems .",
    "it is thus a very interesting issue whether an intrinsic she can exist in electron systems without the so coupling such that the conservation law still holds for the spin current and the spin transport becomes well - described . without the so coupling ,",
    "however , the difficulty is how to effectively couple an electric field to a neutral spin current detached from the charge current . in other words",
    ", one needs to identify a system in which the spin current is not directly carried by the dissipative charge current , and at the same time the former can be directly driven by the electric field . for a weakly interacting system where elementary excitations are quasiparticles which carry both charge and spin under a fermi - liquid description , the spin and charge currents usually can not be simply separated to find such kind of `` dissipationless '' spin hall effect .    on the other hand , in the _",
    "strongly correlated _ electron systems related to the high-@xmath0 cuprates , a ( partial ) separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom @xcite makes it possible to manipulate conserved spin currents which may be distinguishable from ordinary dissipative charge currents . in this paper",
    ", we shall make a proposal that `` non - dissipative ''  spin hall currents indeed exist in the so - called lower pseudogap phase ( lpp ) of the cuprates under the description of the phase string theory @xcite . to be sure ,",
    "so far there is no consensus concerning the correct microscopic theory for high - temperature superconductivity . but making a self - consistent theoretical prediction is very meaningful and possibly the only way to subject a particular theory experimentally testable .",
    "a quantitative prediction of the present work is that a conserved neutral spin current , @xmath1 , along the @xmath2-th direction within the two - dimensional ( 2d ) plane with the spin polarized in the @xmath3-axis ( out of the plane ) , can be generated by an applied electric field as follows :    @xmath4    with @xmath5 as the 2d antisymmetric tensor and @xmath6 the @xmath7-th component of the electric field . here",
    "the spin hall conductivity is given by @xmath8which only depends on the intrinsic properties of the system : @xmath9 is the uniform spin susceptibility and @xmath10 denotes the density of @xmath11 neutral spin excitations , with the electron @xmath12-factor @xmath13 @xmath14 the bohr magneton , and @xmath15 the flux quantum .",
    "note that an external magnetic field @xmath16 is applied perpendicular to the 2d plane , reducing the spin rotational symmetry of the system to the conservation of the @xmath17 component only , satisfying @xmath18 in contrast , the charge current still remains dissipative and the resistivity may even become divergent at low temperature in a strong perpendicular magnetic field , leading to a spin hall insulator where @xmath19 still remains finite . in this sense",
    "we may say that the spin hall current is dissipationless , following a similar characterization in an anomalous hall effect system@xcite .",
    "vorticity can be driven by a perpendicular electric field to form a non - dissipative current and a spin current is simultaneously produced because each vortex is bound to an @xmath20 spin at the core in the spontaneous vortex phase ( see text ) . ]",
    "such an she with conserved and non - dissipative  spin currents is present  in a novel phase of the doped mott insulator described by the phase string theory , known as the _ spontaneous vortex phase _",
    "@xcite , which is characterized by a nonzero electron pairing amplitude @xmath21 without true superconducting ( sc )  phase coherence : the sc pairing order parameter is given by @xmath22where the phase @xmath23 is composed of @xmath24 vortices which are disordered in this state . this spontaneous vortex ( sv )  phase has been previously proposed @xcite to describe the lpp in the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors , featured by nontrivial nernst effect @xcite . in the same theory ,",
    "the nernst signal is interpreted as contributed by the phase slippage of vortices moving along a temperature gradient in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a similar vortex state has been also proposed @xcite recently to described the lpp in the cuprates . but",
    "a unique feature in the present theory is that an @xmath11 neutral spin ( spinon ) is always trapped at the core of each vortex , as a result of the mott physics since the charge is depleted at the core @xcite [ and @xmath25 in ( [ sigmh ] ) is thus equal to the density of free vortices ] . because of the existence of such cheapspinon - vortex composites ( which are also present in the low - temperature sc phase where they remain paired to ensure the sc phase coherence @xcite ) , an electric field can thus easily couple to the neutral spins without involving the so coupling to generate a spin hall current as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . therefore",
    ", the dissipationless  spin hall effect predicted in the present work represents another unique property of such a phase .",
    "we start with a generalized ginzburg - landau ( gl ) description of the sv phase in the phase string theory @xcite @xmath26where @xmath27 describes the holon condensate and the charge current is determined by @xmath28 ~   \\label{supercurrent}\\]]with @xmath29 as the effective mass . here",
    "@xmath30 is the electromagnetic field , and @xmath31 is the internal gauge field defined by @xmath32 ~   \\label{as1}\\]]in which @xmath33  is the spin density .",
    "physically @xmath34 depicts @xmath35 fluxoids bound to spins , as felt  by the holon condensate in ( gleqn ) , which reflects the basic mutual influence between charge and spin degrees of freedom in the phase string theory @xcite .",
    "the phase @xmath23 in the sc order parameter ( [ scorder ] ) is related to @xmath31 by @xmath36 which gives rise to @xmath37 ~\\left [ n_{\\uparrow } ^{b}(\\mathbf{r}% ^{\\prime } ) -n_{\\downarrow } ^{b}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } ) \\right ] .$ ] the sc phase coherence is realized at low temperatures when all spins are resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) paired , leading to the cancellation in @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "free ( unpaired ) @xmath11 spinons then give rise to free @xmath24 vortices in @xmath39 via @xmath23 and thus destroy the phase coherence .",
    "it results in the sv phase with @xmath40 still remaining finite .",
    "so the sv phase exists in a regime @xmath41 with @xmath42 as the characteristic temperature for the holon condensation@xmath43 generally , at @xmath44 , no _ free _ vortices should appear in the condensate @xmath45 except for those @xmath24 vortices in @xmath46 whose cores are _ bound _ to free spinons , which then can be always absorbed into @xmath34 in ( [ supercurrent ] ) and @xmath23 in ( [ scorder ] ) such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 , with @xmath50 \\left [ n^{+}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } ) -n^{-}(\\mathbf{% r}^{\\prime } ) \\right ] ~   \\label{as2}\\]]where @xmath51 with @xmath52 denoting the coordinate of the @xmath53-th spinon carrying a @xmath54 vorticity of sign @xmath55 .",
    "so the sign of the vorticity for a vortex carried by a spinon is not directly associated with the spin index @xmath56 , thanks to the freedom in @xmath57 in @xmath58 [ or @xmath59 in @xmath60 $ ] which ensures the spin rotational symmetry of the system as previously discussed in refs .",
    "sv , gl .",
    "we now consider some important consequences of this generalized gl theory . for a steady current state with @xmath61",
    "we find , in the transverse gauge , the electric field @xmath62 in terms of ( supercurrent)@xmath43 then by using @xmath63 , $ ] the following relation can be established @xmath64with @xmath65 $ ] depicting the vortex current .",
    "the nernst signal generated by a vortex current flowing down along the temperature gradient @xmath66 has been shown @xcite based on ( [ jsv ] ) , which is a basic feature of the sv phase .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the case that @xmath67 is driven directly by the electric field , @xmath68 instead of by a temperature gradient @xmath69 as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . obviously",
    ", it is non - dissipative according to ( [ jsv ] ) and since ( jsv ) holds , locally individual vortices and antivortices will move in opposite directions with @xmath70 in the uniform electric field , additively contributing to the vortex current @xmath71 \\mathbf{v}^{s}.   \\label{jsv1}\\]]here the densities of vortices and antivortices , @xmath72 is constrained by the condition @xmath73 for an arbitrary loop @xmath74 such that on average @xmath75based on ( [ supercurrent ] ) .",
    "namely , the polarization of spinon - vortices and antivortices is determined by the external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the 2d plane . in the superconducting phase , without the presence of spontaneous ( thermally excited ) vortices , equation ( [ n+- ] ) reduces to @xmath76 which represents the flux quantization condition by noting that the flux quantum @xmath77 in the units of @xmath78 and the above gl theory predicts an @xmath11 being always trapped at the core of a magnetic vortex @xcite .",
    "now we focus on the spins carried by these spinon - vortices .",
    "define @xmath79 as the spinon - vortex density with a vorticity @xmath55 and a spin index @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath80 , and the spin current carried by spinon - vortices can be expressed as @xmath81note that since the @xmath11 spin and the sign of the vorticity for a spinon - vortex are independent of each other , the spin polarizations in the magnetic field should equal for @xmath55 vortices , _",
    "@xmath82 one then obtains @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 by using ( [ jsv ] ) and @xmath86 , one finally arrives at ( [ current ] ) and ( [ sigmh ] ) after restoring @xmath87 .",
    "no quantities related to dissipation explicitly appear in ( sigmh ) .",
    "notice that both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are invariant under time - reversal , and @xmath19 is also explicitly unchanged under @xmath90 , in contrast to the charge hall conductance .",
    "furthermore , without the spin - orbit coupling , the spin current @xmath91 always remains conserved in the sv phase .",
    "the above spin hall effect follows directly from the gl equations [ ( gleqn)-([as1 ] ) ] .",
    "note that the non - dissipative relation ( [ jsv ] ) is independent of the coulomb drag  between vortices and antivortices moving in opposite directions , caused by the 2d coulomb - like ( logarithmic ) interaction which exists in the generalized gl equations @xcite .",
    "generally , interactions do not affect ( [ jsv ] ) so that both the spinon - vortex current and spin current are protected  in the sv phase by the pairing amplitude @xmath92 .    then let us consider the charge current in the sv phase .",
    "due to the presence of free spinon vortices , the sc phase coherence is destroyed and the system gains a finite resistivity due to the vortex motion .",
    "such a charge resistivity has been previously obtained based on the generalized gl theory as follows @xcite    @xmath93    where @xmath94 denotes the viscosity of spinon vortices .",
    "note that the contribution from quasiparticles is not considered here . in the units of @xmath95 equation ( [ resistivity ] ) can be written in a duality form @xmath96where @xmath97 and spinon conductance @xmath98 .",
    "thus , a charge current is always dissipative in the sv phase , which is well separated from the spin hall current which is independent of the viscosity @xmath94 of spinon vortices . in this sense , the latter is considered to be dissipationless .      in the sc phase below @xmath0 , vortex - antivortex",
    "are bound together ( spinon confinement ) and no free ( unpaired ) spinon - vortices present in the bulk .",
    "consequently , @xmath99 vanishes such that @xmath100 according to ( [ dualc ] ) . on the other hands",
    ", @xmath56 becomes finite when free spinons emerge in the bulk , which destroy the sc phase coherence as discussed before and contribute to a finite @xmath99 .",
    "in particular , if a finite density of free spinons is present at low temperatures as stabilized by , say , a strong magnetic field , then these unpaired bosonic spinon - vortices can experience a bose condensation such that @xmath101 at @xmath102 correspondingly , based on ( [ dualc ] ) , the charge conductance @xmath103 leading to an insulator as the _ ground state _ of the sv phase . by contrast , the spin hall conductance @xmath19 in ( sigmh ) remains finite as given by ( [ uni ] ) below , unaffected by the vanishing longitudinal charge conductivity .",
    "therefore , such a ground state of the sv phase is a _ spin hall insulator , _ presumably stabilized by strong perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "the bose condensation of spinons implies the existence of some sort of antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "experimentally , both a magnetic - field - induced magnetic ordering @xcite and insulating behavior @xcite have been observed in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "the nontrivial nernst effect @xcite and diamagnetism @xcite , extending over a wide range of temperature , with @xmath104 as large as several times of @xmath0 in underdoping@xmath105 have been also observed in these cuprate materials , strongly suggesting the presence of 2d spontaneous ( cheap ) vortices @xcite as the physical origin . as a unique prediction of the phase string theory",
    ", cheap vortices must have @xmath106 spinons located at the vortex cores due to the mott physics which prohibits double occupancy of electrons : a site is either occupied by a hole or by an @xmath11 spin .",
    "consequently , a dissipationless spin hall conductance is naturally obtained when those free vortices are either thermally excited or magnetic - field induced in the sv phase .",
    "let us finally examine the magnitude of the spin hall conductance @xmath107 given in ( [ sigmh ] ) .",
    "generally , @xmath108 according to ( [ n+- ] ) ( the equality holds if the vortices are fully polarized by the magnetic field ) and @xmath109 .",
    "so @xmath110 decides an upper bound for @xmath19 . at a temperature slightly above @xmath0 ,",
    "a typical @xmath9 can be estimated @xmath111 @xmath112 in the phase string theory @xcite , which is comparable to the experimental values in the cuprates . by taking the lattice constant @xmath113 ,",
    "we then obtain @xmath114 .",
    "of course , @xmath115 is generally reduced from @xmath116 with the increase of the thermally ( spontaneously ) excited vortices above @xmath0 . on the other hand , at low temperatures where the thermally excited spinon - vortices are negligible , and all vortices are nucleated by the applied magnetic field",
    ", one has @xmath117 according to ( n+- ) .",
    "furthermore , the spins of the vortices are totally polarized by @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 if the temperature is sufficiently low",
    ". then in this limit one finds @xmath121which approaches a universal number as all spins are in rvb paired except for those associated with the vortices nucleated by the magnetic field gl .",
    "note that @xmath122 if the sc phase coherence is realized when those vortices are pinned spatially , where @xmath123 unless the electric field @xmath124 in the bulk .",
    "namely ( [ uni ] ) is valid only in the vortex flow regime at low temperature .",
    "so far the she in the sv phase has been discussed based on the generalized gl equations ( [ gleqn ] ) and ( [ supercurrent ] ) of the phase string theory . in the following",
    "we briefly discuss how this is a self - consistent result ensured by the underlying mutual duality structure of the microscopic theory .",
    "the mutual - chern - simons effective description of the phase string theory is given by an effective lagrangian @xmath125 @xcite , with the charge part @xmath126 which describes that the charge @xmath127 holon field @xmath128 couples to an external electromagnetic field @xmath129",
    "( @xmath130 ) and an internal gauge field @xmath131 .",
    "the spin part @xmath132 describes the neutral spinon field couples to an another gauge field @xmath133 , whose detailed form @xcite is not important here . here",
    "both @xmath131 and @xmath134 can be regarded as free   gauge fields , which are entangled  by the mutual - chern - simons term @xmath135note that the topological constraint on @xmath31 in ( [ as1 ] ) only emerges after the temporal component @xmath136 is integrated out in the partition function determined by @xmath137 .",
    "the time - reversal , parity , and global spin rotational symmetries have been shown to be retained in @xmath137 at @xmath138 and the global phase diagram , including antiferromagnetic phase , sc phase , pseudogap and sv phases , has been discussed within such a unified description @xcite .",
    "one can then show that @xmath139 will generally result in the following equation of motion @xmath140where @xmath141 @xmath142 and @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "thus , a spin current can be generated by a perpendicular electric field  @xmath146 and the charge current by @xmath147 according to ( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "the spin - current conservation here is due to the gauge invariance associated with @xmath148 .    in particular , consider the sv phase defined by the bose condensation of holons with @xmath149 . according to @xmath150 , @xmath89 ( via @xmath129 ) would accelerate the condensate unless it balanced by @xmath151 ( via @xmath131 ) , satisfying @xmath152 where the right - hand - side is contributed by the vortices in the phase of @xmath153 . by incorporating the latter into @xmath88 which gives rise to @xmath154 similar to the previous discussion ,",
    "one then reproduces ( [ jsv ] ) .",
    "therefore , the non - dissipative spin currents are quite robust so long as @xmath155 and thus the pairing amplitude @xmath21 remains finite , which defines the sv phase . on the other hand , vacancy impurities like the zinc substitution in the cuprates may greatly reduce the spin currents by very effectively pinning @xcite down the free spinon - vortices .",
    "similarly the nernst effect is expected to be suppressed by the same reason .",
    "another interesting property of ( [ eqm ] ) is that a charge current flowing through the sample will generate an electric filed  @xmath147 , which acts on the spinon part via @xmath132 and thus provides a means of spin pump .",
    "it may be manipulated to design a spin battery  in such a system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , define @xmath156 @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "then by simply using the relations in ( jsv ) and ( [ eqm ] ) , one easily finds the interesting duality relation ( [ dualc ] ) between the charge conductance @xmath159 and spinon conductance @xmath160 previously obtained in the generalized gl theory description @xcite .",
    "in the paper , the existence of a conserved dissipationless spin hall current is predicted in the low - temperature pseudogap regime of a doped mott insulator , known as the spontaneous vortex phase , based on the phase string description .",
    "such a spin hall current is concomitant with the nernst signal , but is dissipationless whereas the latter is not .",
    "a sizable spin hall conductivity is obtained which only depends on the intrinsic bulk properties as well as the external magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the spin hall conductivity remains finite even if the longitudinal charge resistivity diverges when the pseudogap state is stabilized by strong magnetic fields in the ground state , leading to a spin hall insulator .",
    "note that the spin hall insulator here is caused by strongly correlated effect ( a quantum vortex liquid ) which has nothing directly to do with that discussed in the so systems where a band gap is present .",
    "we emphasize that the spin hall current is protected here by the electron pairing amplitude .",
    "the she constitutes a sharp and very unique prediction for the lower pseudogap phase which can be tested in the future experiment .",
    "we point out that the present experimental techniques @xcite allow one to detect only spin accumulations that the spin currents deposit at interfaces and boundaries , which become detectable with the help of the strong so coupling @xcite . thus in order to observe the she in the high-@xmath0 materials , a natural method is to make a finite - width strip of the relevant materials been sandwiched by semiconductors of strong so coupling and determine the spin accumulations at the interfaces by the conventional techniques @xcite .",
    "finally , if such a she does exist in the cuprate materials , it may have some important potential applications in spintronics devices due to its sizable effect , conserved and non - dissipative nature , as well as the relatively wide region of the lower pseudogap phase .",
    "compared to the she proposed mur1,niu in the semiconductor systems with so couplings , however , we would like also to point out a drawback in the present system , namely , a perpendicular magnetic field is always needed here , which may hinder practical applications and should be further carefully investigated .",
