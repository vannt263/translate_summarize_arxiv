    "the _ fermi _ satellite has detected 18 grbs ( gamma - ray burst ) at energies @xmath0100 mev by lat ( large area telescope ) . this emission can be described as follows .",
    "the first 100 mev photons arrive @xmath3 s ( in the host galaxy frame ) after the trigger time , for long grbs ; the trigger time is the time when low energy photons ( @xmath4 mev ) are first detected by the gbm ( gamma - ray burst monitor aboard _ fermi _ ) .",
    "the 100 mev light curve rises fast until it peaks and then it decays as a single power - law for a long duration of time ( of order 10@xmath5 s )  much longer than the duration of the lower energy photons detected by gbm  until it falls below the detector s sensitivity .",
    "radiation above 100 mev from grbs has been suggested to be produced via the synchrotron mechanism in the external forward shock ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ) ; the external forward shock scenario was first proposed by rees & mszros ( 1992 ) , mszros & rees ( 1993 ) , paczyski & rhoads ( 1993 ) , and since then it has been used widely , see , e.g. , mszros & rees ( 1997 ) , sari , piran , narayan ( 1998 ) , dermer & mitman ( 1999 ) , for a comprehensive review see , e.g. , piran ( 2004 ) and references therein . after our initial suggestion , many groups have also considered and provided evidence for this origin of the @xmath0100 mev radiation ( gao et al .",
    "2009 ; corsi , guetta , piro 2010 ; de pasquale et al . 2010 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini , nava 2010 ; ghisellini , ghirlanda , nava 2010 ) .",
    "the magnetic field required for this model is consistent with being produced via shock - compressed seed magnetic field in the csm ( circum - stellar medium ) of strength of a few tens of micro - gauss .",
    "the peak of the 100 mev light curve can be attributed to the deceleration time which is the time it takes for the grb - jet to transfer about half of its energy to the external medium .",
    "we investigate in this work whether electrons in the external forward shock can be accelerated to sufficiently high lorentz factors , even for a small csm magnetic field of a few tens of @xmath6 g , so that the synchrotron radiation can extend to @xmath7 gev as seen by _",
    "fermi_/lat for a number of grbs .",
    "we study the electrons acceleration in the context of diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. , krymskii 1977 , axford , leer & skadron 1978 , bell 1978 , blandford & ostriker 1978 , blandford & eichler 1987 ) , which was developed for non - relativistic shocks and has now been developed to consider relativistic shocks ( semi- ) analytically ( e.g. gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg et al . 2001 ) and recently using 2d particle - in - cell simulations ( e.g. spitkovsky 2008a , b , keshet et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we assume that the electrons acceleration proceeds in the bohm diffusion limit and that the magnetic field downstream is simply shock - compressed upstream magnetic field ( other possibilities are considered in , e.g. , milosavljevi & nakar 2006 , sironi & goodman 2007 , goodman & macfadyen 2008 , couch , milosavljevi , nakar 2008 ) .",
    "if the downstream magnetic field is simply the shock - compressed large - scale upstream field , then the field component perpendicular to the shock normal is amplified , while the parallel component is not . in this case",
    ", the downstream magnetic field will be mainly pointing to the direction perpendicular to the shock front normal , therefore particles trying to cross the shock front from downstream to upstream will find it difficult to catch up with the shock front , which moves with a speed of @xmath8 with respect to the downstream medium ( see , e.g. , achterberg et al .",
    "2001 , lemoine , pelletier & revenu 2006 , pelletier , lemoine & marcowith 2009 ) .",
    "one way that the particles might return to the upstream is if there is efficient cross - field diffusion of particles , which might occur if turbulent magnetic field is produced downstream ( jokipii 1987 , achterberg & ball 1994 , achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) . in principle",
    ", the turbulent magnetic field could dominate the shock - compressed field throughout the downstream region .",
    "however , it seems that although some turbulence is present just downstream of the shock front it does not persist across the entire downstream region ( see recent simulations by sironi & spitkovsky 2010 that show that magnetic field is amplified only right behind the shock front and returns to the shock - compressed value far downstream ) . in this case , much of the radiation is produced by particles swept downstream where the turbulence has died out and the magnetic field is consistent with the shock - compressed value .",
    "we also note that as long as the thickness of the turbulent magnetic field layer is smaller than the thickness of the shocked fluid divided by @xmath9 then the energy loss in the turbulent layer is small ; @xmath10 is the turbulent magnetic field strength and @xmath11 is the shock - compressed magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in this work we neglect energy loss in the turbulent magnetic field layer since it persists for a very short distance compared to the thickness of the shocked fluid ( see , e.g. , keshet et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we address the question of high - energy electron confinement upstream and downstream of the shock front , and also radiative losses suffered by electrons in between acceleration .",

    ", we calculate the rise of the external forward shock light curve , taking into consideration the non - zero time to accelerate electrons to high enough energies so they can radiate at @xmath0100 mev .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "it is widely believed that electrons in non - relativistic shocks undergo diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "( e.g. , krymskii 1977 , axford et al .",

    ", it has been shown that electrons gain energy each time they cross the shock front by a factor of @xmath12 , except on the first crossing when they gain energy by a factor of the lorentz factor ( lf ) of the shock front ( achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in order for electrons to turnaround while up / down stream and cross the shock front",
    ", their larmor radius should be smaller than the size of the system , i.e. electrons should be confined to the system in order to be accelerated . in this subsection , we explore the confinement of electrons in the external forward shock model when the magnetic field in the unshocked medium , upstream of the shock front , is a few tens of @xmath6 g in strength , and the magnetic field in the shocked medium , downstream of the shock front , is simply the shock - compressed upstream field .",
    "the highest photon energy detected for _ fermi _ grbs is on the order of 10 gev .",
    "we first calculate the random lf in the downstream co - moving frame , @xmath13 , of electrons radiating 10 gev photons via synchrotron radiation , because these electrons have the largest larmor radius and thus give us stricter confinement requirements .",
    "the synchrotron frequency in observer frame is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the bulk lf of the shocked fluid measured in the upstream rest frame ( lab frame ) , @xmath16 is the magnetic field downstream ( measured in the local rest frame ) , @xmath17 is the redshift , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron s mass and charge , respectively , and @xmath20 is the speed of light ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "we convert the synchrotron frequency to 10 gev , i.e. , @xmath21 erg , where @xmath22 is the planck constant and 10 gev corresponds to @xmath23 erg . using the convention @xmath24 and solving the last expression for @xmath13 yields    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the magnetic field upstream , which is the magnetic field in the csm . to obtain ( 1 )",
    "we have assumed that the magnetic field in the downstream region is @xmath27 ( gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg et al . 2001 ; note that the shock front lf measured in the lab frame is @xmath28 , blandford & mckee 1976 ) , i.e. @xmath11 is the shock - compressed magnetic field in the upstream ( lab frame ) , which is what we have found for _ fermi _ grbs ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "the electrons lf in the rest frame of the upstream plasma is @xmath29 , therefore , the larmor radius in the upstream is given by @xmath30 where we made use of ( 1 ) to eliminate @xmath13 . comparing the larmor radius with the size of the system upstream , @xmath31 , which is given by the blast wave radius in the host galaxy rest frame",
    " @xmath32 cm ( where @xmath33 a few seconds and @xmath34 is the blast wave lorentz factor , e.g. abdo et al .",
    "2009a )  we find that @xmath35 .",
    "this might suggest that electrons of @xmath36 are not confined to the system .",
    "however , an electron upstream of the shock front travels only a distance @xmath37 before returning to the downstream , because by the time the angle between electrons velocity vector and the normal to the shock front exceeds @xmath38 , the shock front catches up with the electron and sweeps it back downstream ( achterberg et al . 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , for electron confinement upstream one should compare @xmath39 with @xmath31 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy in the blast wave , @xmath42 is the time since the burst trigger in observer frame , and @xmath43 is the number density of particles in the csm ; in deriving the second equality we made use of the time dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath31 in the external forward shock scenario for a homogeneous csm ( sari , piran , narayan 1998 ) . for @xmath44 found for the _ fermi _ bursts , @xmath45 , and , thus , electrons radiating at 10 gev can not escape from the upstream side of the shock front ; note that this conclusion holds for at least several hours in the observer frame .",
    "one should also check for electron confinement downstream . here",
    ", the larmor radius is smaller than it is upstream , because the magnetic field is larger by at least a factor of @xmath46 due to shock compression .",
    "therefore , the requirement for the confinement of electrons downstream is automatically satisfied whenever it is satisfied upstream .",
    "we conclude that there is no problem confining external forward shock electrons that radiate @xmath210 gev synchrotron photons by the csm magnetic field of strength @xmath47",
    "@xmath6 g .",
    "electrons suffer radiative losses while being accelerated that could prevent them from reaching lfs of @xmath48 that are needed for radiating photons of 10 gev via the synchrotron process . in this section ,",
    "we ascertain whether or not the radiative losses suffered by electrons ",
    "due to synchrotron and inverse - compton processes  are small compared with the energy gain in each round of crossing the shock front .",
    "we do this by comparing the total radiative cooling time - scale , @xmath49 , which is the time - scale for electrons to lose half of their energy , with the acceleration time - scale .    for the case of ultra - relativistic shocks when the downstream magnetic field is simply the shock compressed upstream field , the upstream and downstream residency times for electrons are approximately equal , when particle diffusion is in the bohm limit ( gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg et al .",
    "thus , the time it takes for electrons to make one complete cycle across the shock front is about twice the upstream residency time , and the upstream residency time is on the order of the gyro - time in the shock front co - moving frame ( baring 2004 ) . in the lab frame ,",
    "their upstream residency time is on the order of the time it takes them to travel a distance @xmath37 .",
    "since the larmor radius ( @xmath50 ) increases with increasing electron energy , the last shock crossing dominates the total upstream residency time .",
    "thus , the time , in the co - moving frame of the blast wave , that electrons spend during the last cycle of crossing the shock front ( upstream @xmath51 downstream @xmath51 upstream ) before getting accelerated to lorentz factor @xmath13  given by ( 1 ) is :    @xmath52    taking into account the energy loss that these electrons experience because of radiative cooling , the acceleration time - scale , in the blast wave co - moving frame , is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the elapsed time since the beginning of the explosion when @xmath55 ( shock front crossing time should be equal to at least half of the the radiative cooling time in order to reach a particular @xmath13 ) . at @xmath56",
    "the electron barely reaches @xmath13 , therefore , it needs an extra time on the order of @xmath57 to fully reach the desired @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath58 , then the radiative cooling is too strong and prevents the electron from reaching the desired @xmath13 . in the sub - sections below we discuss synchrotron and inverse - compton losses and calculate the radiative cooling time .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time - scale ( in the blast wave co - moving frame ) in the upstream of the shock front is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the thomson scattering cross - section .",
    "we find that the synchrotron cooling time for an external froward shock electron with lf given by ( 1 ) is @xmath61 since @xmath62 by a factor of 30 , then synchrotron cooling in the upstream is unimportant for electrons radiating at 10 gev .",
    "next , we calculate synchrotron losses in the downstream . since @xmath63 , the synchrotron loss rate is larger downstream because of the larger magnetic field . for shock - compressed magnetic field downstream , @xmath64 is larger than upstream field by a factor 4 ( in the blast wave co - moving frame ) , and therefore @xmath65 .",

    "we calculate the inverse - compton ( ic ) cooling time - scale for electrons .",
    "the inverse - compton cooling time depends on the energy density of photons , and on the electron lf .",
    "electrons in the external forward shock region are exposed to photons from three different sources of radiation : ( a ) prompt @xmath2mev @xmath71-ray radiation which carries most of the energy release in grbs ; ( b ) synchrotron radiation produced in the external forward shock heated csm and ( c ) radiation produced in the external reverse shock heated grb - jet .",
    "we will consider all of these sources in our estimate for the ic cooling time .",
    "all calculations will be carried out in the rest frame of the shocked csm .",
    "the ic cooling time is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the energy flux in radiation per unit frequency in the co - moving frame of the shocked csm , @xmath74 is photon frequency in observer frame , and @xmath75 is the cross - section for interaction between electrons and photons ; @xmath76 ( thomson cross - section ) when @xmath77\\equiv \\nu_{kn}$ ] , and for @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",

    "we note that for @xmath87 , only the first term in ( 9 ) should be kept .",

    "therefore , we find from ( 11 ) that , for @xmath105 ,    @xmath106    * case ( c ) * : if the grb - jet is composed of protons and electrons , then the interaction of the jet with the csm will heat up these particles by the reverse shock propagating into the cold jet , and the synchrotron radiation produced would be very effective at cooling electrons in the forward shock region .",
    "this is because the peak of the reverse shock emission at the deceleration time is typically at a few ev ( sari & piran 1999a ) , which is of order @xmath82 for electrons of @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath108 , then we can keep only the first term in ( 9 ) , and use ( 10 ) for flux in the calculation of the cooling time .",
    "the observed luminosity ( at the deceleration time ) is given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the observed external reverse shock flux and peak energy at the deceleration time , respectively .",

    "the external reverse shock emission depends on the highly uncertain magnetic field strength in the grb - jet , and it is therefore difficult to estimate with any confidence .",

    "the external shock model , with a weak magnetic field , has been proposed as the origin of the observed @xmath0100 mev emission detected by the _ fermi _ satellite from a number of grbs ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "we find that high - energy electrons of lorentz factor @xmath146 , required for producing @xmath210 gev photons via the synchrotron process , can indeed be accelerated in an external shock that is moving through a csm with a magnetic field of strength a few tens of @xmath6 g ; they remain confined to the shock front as long as the upstream magnetic field is @xmath1 g .",
    "we have also calculated the time it takes for electrons to be accelerated to a lorentz factor @xmath147 so that they can radiate synchrotron photons at @xmath2100 mev .",
    "we find this acceleration time to be a few seconds in the observer frame ; this calculation took into account radiation losses suffered during the acceleration process .",
    "this result offers a straightforward explanation as to why , for most _ fermi _ grbs , 100 mev photons are not observed right at the trigger time but a little later .",
    "this also explains , why 100 mev photons are observed before gev radiation : it takes electrons radiating at gev energies even longer time to accelerate . taking this acceleration time into consideration while calculating high - energy light curves , we find that the light curve rises very rapidly  much faster than it does for the external forward shock model with instantaneous electron acceleration for which the flux rises as @xmath128 when the csm has uniform density ( the @xmath128 rise reflects the increasing number of swept - up electrons before the blast wave decelerates ) .",
    "the detection of the first 100 mev photons at some fraction of the deceleration time , the longer delays in the detection of higher energy photons mev emission , where higher energy photons arrive _ earlier _ than lower energy photons in long grbs and there is no lag detected for short grbs ( norris et al .",
    "1986 , norris & bonnell 2006 ) . ] and the fast rise of the 100 mev light curve , follow the expectation of the external forward shock model when the finite time for electron acceleration is taken into account .",
    "detection of synchrotron photons of different energies provides an upper limit for the radiation flux produced in the reverse shock heated grb - jet .",
    "for instance , the peak flux for the external reverse shock emission  if the peak of the spectrum is at a few ev  could nt have been larger than about 300 mjy close to the deceleration time , for grb080916c , otherwise it would prevent electrons from accelerating to a lorentz factor of @xmath147 so that they can produce synchrotron photons of 100 mev energy at early times ( see table 2 ) . similarly , the reverse - shock flux should be @xmath148 20 mjy for grb 080916c in order that electrons in the forward shock are accelerated to a lf so that they produce 1 gev photons .",
    "we speculate that the lack of @xmath0100mev emission during the prompt phase of grbs might be due to the presence of a bright optical source with observed flux larger than about 100 mjy , which would prevent electrons from reaching high lorentz factors .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that grbs with the largest lfs , which have small deceleration time , are the most likely bursts to be detected by _",
    "( kumar & barniol duran 2009 ) might explain the detection / non - detection of @xmath149mev radiation from grbs .",
    "we note that the shock - compressed magnetic field scenario requires some cross - field diffusion of particles - presumably generated by turbulence - to allow them to travel back to the upstream ( e.g. achterberg et al . 2001 , lemoine et al .",
    "this turbulent layer probably occupies a small fraction of the downstream region as suggested by recent simulations by sironi & spitkovsky ( 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , the picture that seems to emerge from numerical simulations and _ fermi _ observations , is that there might be a small region of turbulence behind the shock front that aids in the acceleration of particles across the shock , but that the radiation is mainly produced by particles that are swept downstream where the value of the downstream field is consistent with simple shock - compression of upstream field .",
    "there exists also the possibility that the csm seed field is actually a few @xmath6 g and some instability produced ahead of the shock amplifies it to the value of a few tens of @xmath6 g we infer by our modeling of _ fermi _ grbs ( kumar & barniol duran 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "these instabilities have been studied by , e.g. , milosavljevi & nakar 2006 , sironi & goodman 2007 , goodman & macfadyen 2008 , couch et al . 2008",

    "<S> we find that these electrons remain confined to the shock front , as long as the upstream magnetic field is @xmath1 g , and do nt suffer substantial radiative losses , the only condition required is that the external reverse shock emission be not too bright : peak flux less than 1 jy in order to produce photons of 100 mev , and less than @xmath2100 mjy for producing 1-gev photons . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the acceleration time for electrons radiating at 100 mev is a few seconds ( in observer frame ) , and the acceleration time is somewhat longer for electrons radiating at a few gev . </S>",
