    "the transfer of information between elements of a quantum computational system requires the use of entangling quantum interactions @xcite .",
    "undesired interactions between the system and its surroundings can destroy quantum coherences and thus are a critical obstacle to successful quantum computation ( qc ) .",
    "the feasibility of creating high - fidelity quantum gates in the presence of environmentally - induced decoherence is one of the most important problems to overcome for practical qc . in particular , in spin - based solid - state realizations of qc",
    "@xcite one encounters a difficult task of effectively separating a multiparticle quantum system into interacting and non - interacting components .    quantum error correction ( qec ) enables fault - tolerant qc @xcite , but only when the errors in quantum gate operations are sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very important to decrease the errors caused by decoherence .",
    "this problem has inspired significant interest in various methods of decoherence management , including the use of decoherence - free subspaces and noiseless subsystems @xcite , quantum dynamical decoupling @xcite , schemes based on stochastic control @xcite , optimal control techniques @xcite , and multilevel encoding of logical states @xcite .",
    "the method of optimal control @xcite enables managing the dynamics of complex quantum systems in a very precise and specific manner and therefore is especially useful in qc .",
    "in addition to applications to the problem of dynamical suppression of decoherence @xcite , optimal control theory ( oct ) @xcite was also successfully used to design unitary quantum gates in closed systems @xcite .",
    "the optimal control of quantum gates in the presence of decoherence still remains to be fully explored .",
    "in @xcite we previously considered the optimal control of quantum gates for qubits encoded in multilevel subspaces ; this method makes quantum gates immune to mixing and decoherence that occur within the encoding subspaces .",
    "recent works @xcite developed specific techniques , involving optimizations over sets of controls operating in pre - designed `` weak - decoherence '' subspaces . in the present paper",
    "we propose a different approach in which the full power of oct is used to generate the target gate with the highest possible fidelity while simultaneously suppressing strong decoherence induced by coupling to a multiparticle environment .",
    "this method does not rely on any special pre - design of the system parameters to avoid or weaken decoherence ( e.g. , using multiple levels as in @xcite , tunable inter - qubit couplings as in @xcite , or auxiliary qubits as in @xcite ) ; the only control used in the present approach is a time - dependent external field .",
    "a similar oct - based approach was recently used @xcite to design quantum gates for solid - state qubits in the presence of decoherence .",
    "however , the objective in @xcite was to optimize a purity - dependent quality factor ( or , in @xcite , the purity itself ) , instead of the actual gate fidelity . in the present work",
    "we demonstrate that although improving the purity of the quantum information processor ( qip ) is necessary for performing a high - fidelity quantum gate , it is not sufficient . even if the qip is completely decoupled from its environment at a given time , this does not ensure that the desired gate operation will be performed at the decoupling time . therefore , we optimize a gate fidelity @xcite which directly measures the distance between the target quantum gate of the qip and the actual transformation of the composite system .",
    "optimization techniques were also applied recently to qec @xcite .",
    "in contrast to qec , our approach does not require ancilla qubits and is not limited to the weak decoherence regime .",
    "the optimal control of quantum gates can potentially be used in conjunction with qec to achieve fault tolerance with an improved threshold .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a model system composed of interacting two - level particles , for example , spin - half atomic nuclei or electrons or two - level atoms .",
    "a small set of particles serve as qubits in the qip ; the rest of the particles serve as an effective environment .",
    "the qubits are directly controlled by a time - dependent external field , while the environmental particles do not directly couple to the field .",
    "the control objective is to generate target quantum gates in the qip with the highest possible fidelity .",
    "the optimal control field must perform the desired gate operation while simultaneously suppressing the qubit - environment interaction and restoring lost coherence to the qip .",
    "this model is sufficiently simple to allow for a full numerical treatment of the entire composite system , and the results are relevant to important physical applications , in particular , to spin - based solid - state realizations of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "for example , our model bears a similarity to systems in which an electron spin ( or a pair of electron spins ) is coupled to a nuclear spin bath @xcite .",
    "coherent manipulation of electron spins via rapid electrical control of the exchange interaction has been successfully demonstrated in such systems @xcite .",
    "the analysis reported in the present work indicates that the employment of the optimal control methods may increase the effectiveness of coherent management of coupled spin dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] presents the model ( including an explicit matrix form for the simplest case of one qubit coupled to a one - particle environment ) and schemes of multiparticle couplings . in section  [ sec : dist ] , we consider a distance measure that quantifies the fidelity of quantum gates .",
    "this fidelity is independent of the initial state and is evaluated directly from the evolution operator of the composite system .",
    "section  [ sec : deco ] investigates the dynamics of decoherence in the uncontrolled system for various values of system parameters . in order to fully explore the utility of oct , we select a set of parameters that enhances the loss of coherence in the uncontrolled system . in section  [ sec : optimize ] , we describe in detail the genetic and gradient optimization algorithms .",
    "the results obtained with the optimal controls are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : robust ] investigates the robustness of optimal solutions to uncertainties in the system parameters .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] concludes with a summary of the results and discusses future directions .",
    "we use a model of @xmath0 interacting two - level particles ( e.g. , spin - half particles or two - level atoms ) , which are divided into the qip , composed of @xmath1 qubits , and an @xmath2-particle environment ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the qubits are directly coupled to a time - dependent external control field , while the environment is not directly controlled and is managed only through its interaction with the qubits .",
    "the evolution of the composite system of qubits and environment is treated in an exact quantum - mechanical manner , without either approximating the dynamics by a master equation or using a perturbative analysis based on the weak coupling assumption .",
    "the hamiltonian for the composite controlled system , @xmath4 , has the form @xmath5 @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the spin operator for the @xmath8th particle ( @xmath9 , in terms of the pauli matrices ) , @xmath10 is the sum over the free hamiltonians @xmath11 for all @xmath0 particles ( @xmath12 is the transition angular frequency for the @xmath8th particle ) , @xmath13 specifies the coupling between the @xmath1 qubits and the time - dependent control field @xmath14 ( @xmath15 are the dipole moments ) , and @xmath16 represents the heisenberg exchange interaction between the particles ( @xmath17 is the coupling constant for the @xmath8th and @xmath18th particles ) .",

    ". the problem of evaluating the actual gate fidelity is complicated by the fact that the evolution of the qip is non - unitary due to the interaction with the environment . nevertheless , it is possible to define a useful measure of the distance between the target quantum gate of the qip and the actual evolution operator of the composite system @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 be the unitary time - evolution operator of the composite system and @xmath47 be the unitary target transformation for the quantum gate of the qip ( where @xmath48 denotes the group of all @xmath49 unitary matrices ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : fit - deco ] shows the time behavior of the von neumann entropy of the qip for optimally controlled one - qubit gates ( with @xmath204 and @xmath119 ) . by comparing figures  [ fig : fit - deco ]  and  [ fig : deco ] , we observe that the optimal control dramatically enhances coherence of the qubit system in comparison to the uncontrolled dynamics .",
    "decoherence is suppressed by the control at all times , but especially at the end of the gate operation ( i.e. , for @xmath56 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath206 for the hadamard gate with @xmath119 , which means that at @xmath56 the qubit system and environment are almost completely uncoupled .",
    "inspecting eigenvalues of the controlled hamiltonian , we find that the intense control field creates significant dynamic shifts of the energy levels .",
    "specifically , under the influence of the optimal control field , four of the six transition frequencies of the composite system experience high - amplitude oscillations ( following the corresponding changes in the field strength ) .",
    "this effect is mainly responsible for reducing the qubit - environment interaction during the control pulse .",
    "however , achieving extremely low final - time entropies and correspondingly high gate fidelities requires the employment of an induced coherence revival .",
    "for the selected set of the system parameters , revivals in the uncontrolled dynamics occur at times much longer than @xmath45 ( specifically , @xmath207 and @xmath208 ) , so that the almost complete coherence revival observed at @xmath56 is induced exclusively by the control field .    for very short gate durations @xmath209 , a different type of optimal solution",
    "the control fails to induce revivals at such short times and therefore generates gates with smaller fidelities ( e.g. , @xmath210 for the hadamard transform with @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) . in this short - time regime",
    "the control relies on the decoherence suppression via dynamic shifting of the energy levels and on very fast operation ( trying to perform the target transformation in the shortest time possible to limit the effect of decoherence ) , but not on the creation of coherence revivals .",
    "such short - time controls can be useful for environments with very dense spectra , for which the induced - revival times will be impractically long .",
    "we study in detail how the choice of the control duration @xmath45 affects properties of the optimal control field , gate fidelity , and decoherence dynamics . specifically , we optimize the one - qubit hadamard gate ( with a one - particle environment and @xmath211 ) for all integer values of @xmath45 between 2 and 40 using the gradient algorithm described in section  [ sec : grad ] . for @xmath213",
    "we find the fast - control no - revival regime described above .",
    "interestingly , most optimal control fields with @xmath214 , in addition to inducing an almost complete coherence revival at the final time , also produce a partial revival at approximately @xmath215 .",
    "optimal control fields with @xmath216 typically exhibit large amplitudes and fluences and strong low - frequency components .",
    "for @xmath217 we find the optimal control field that generates the quantum gate with a better fidelity while having a smaller amplitude and fluence , as compared to the fields obtained for shorter control durations .",
    "as @xmath45 increases to 25 , the gate fidelity increases to approximately 0.9995 , the final - time entropy decreases to approximately @xmath218 , and the maximum field amplitude decreases to approximately 2.0 .",
    "however , increasing @xmath45 above @xmath219 does not improve the optimal gate performance ; the field amplitudes , gate fidelities , and final - time entropy values change very slightly for @xmath220 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this behavior is that the control requires some time ( @xmath221 in the present case ) to almost completely reverse the information flow between the qip and environment , and induce a nearly perfect coherence revival . from these results",
    ", it appears that the pulse duration is a very important characteristic of the control fields employed for quantum gate generation .",
    "the time - dependent state of the qip , which is coupled to the environment , is represented by the reduced density matrix ( [ red - dens ] ) . in order to examine the reduced dynamics of the qip ,",
    "it is instructive to use the kraus - map representation @xcite .",
    "if the composite system was initially ( i.e. , at time @xmath222 ) in the direct - product state , @xmath223 then the reduced dynamics of the qip has the following form ( known as the kraus map @xcite ) : @xmath224   = \\sum_{\\nu , \\nu ' = 1}^{2^n } k_{\\nu \\nu'}(t ) \\rho_{\\mathrm{q}}(0 ) k_{\\nu \\nu'}^{\\dag}(t),\\ ] ] where the kraus operators @xmath225 are given by    @xmath226    it is well known @xcite that there exist infinitely many different sets of kraus operators , @xmath227 ( where @xmath228 is the number of operators in the set ) , that represent the same map @xmath66 ( i.e. , they evolve @xmath229 in exactly the same way ) .",
    "moreover , any kraus map for an @xmath92-level quantum system can be represented by a set of @xmath230 kraus operators .",
    "that is , if the map is represented by a set of @xmath231 kraus operators , there always exists another representation with not more than @xmath232 operators .",
    "therefore , for our system of @xmath1 qubits and @xmath2 environmental particles , the set of @xmath233 kraus operators ( [ k - operators ] ) can always be transformed into another set of not more than @xmath234 operators , representing the same map @xmath66 .",
    "however , since we numerically study kraus operators only for the case of @xmath235 , there is no practical need for such a transformation .    in calculations , we use @xmath236 with @xmath237 of ( [ initial ] ) . for one qubit",
    "coupled to a one - particle environment , we use the notation @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to explore either @xmath240 or @xmath241 . by evaluating the kraus operators we can quantify the non - unitarity of the qubit dynamics .",
    "it is important to note that the non - unitary evolution is not only responsible for decoherence , but is also required to steer the information flow back to the qip . the control field that restores coherence to",
    "the qip necessarily employs the interaction with the environment and the corresponding non - unitary dynamics .",
    "we examine the time behavior of the frobenius norm of the kraus operator , @xmath242 , that serves as a measure of non - unitarity .",
    "figure  [ fig : k12 ] shows @xmath242 for both controlled and uncontrolled dynamics . in comparison to the uncontrolled evolution , the optimal control dramatically decreases the non - unitarity of the qubit dynamics during the gate operation , culminating in almost complete decoupling at the final time @xmath45 .",
    "we also see that , under the optimal control , @xmath242 is approximately symmetric about @xmath205 . inspecting the time derivative of the entropy , @xmath243 , we find that @xmath244 reaches the maximum at approximately the same time ( just prior to @xmath215 ) when the fastest decrease in the qubit s entropy is observed , indicating the maximum flow of information into the qip .",
    "we explore the performance of optimally controlled one - qubit gates in the presence of multiparticle environments described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "table  [ results ] reports optimal control field parameters , fidelity , and final - time entropy for the one - qubit hadamard gate coupled to @xmath2-particle environments @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath119 ) . for @xmath34 , the values in table  [ results ]",
    "were obtained with the coupling scheme modeled by a two - dimensional lattice of ( [ square_c ] ) ; however , very similar results were obtained with the linear nearest - neighbor coupling scheme of ( [ nnc ] ) .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath247 further illustrate the benefits of optimal controls which explicitly take into account coupling to the environment .",
    "the entropy dynamics indicate that for multiparticle environments the control employs the same mechanism of an induced coherence revival , as described above for @xmath42 . fast and intense control fields significantly suppress the qubit - environment interaction during the gate operation and try to recover as much of the lost information as possible before the end of the control pulse .",
    "however , as the complexity of the composite system increases , it becomes more difficult to induce an almost perfect revival ; therefore , the gate fidelity and final - time coherence decrease as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this observation supports the conclusion that shorter - time controls ( which do not rely on revivals ) will be useful for environments with dense spectra .",

    "the same pattern of a partial revival at an intermediate time followed by an almost complete revival at @xmath56 , seen for the one - qubit gates in figure  [ fig : fit - deco ] , is also present for the two - qubit gate , but on a longer time scale .",
    "for the cnot gate s final - time coherence revival we find @xmath263 at @xmath264 .",
    "we observe that the fidelity of the optimally controlled quantum gates decreases with increases in @xmath2 ( the number of environmental particles ) and , even more significantly , @xmath1 ( the number of qubits in the qip ) .",

    "there exist an infinite number of unitary , or almost unitary , transformations which nevertheless are very far from the target one .    in order to further emphasize this point ,",
    "we generalize the notion of the gate fidelity ( as measured by the distance between the actual evolution operator @xmath152 and target transformation @xmath55 ) to all times @xmath272 .",

    "this example shows that fidelity and coherence do not always correlate and that a very low value of the entropy does not always result in a correspondingly high value of the gate fidelity . according to this analysis , a strategy of maximizing the state purity @xcite",
    "does not ensure the generation of target quantum gates with the highest possible fidelity .",
    "we observed that applying the control field optimized for the closed system ( @xmath199 ) to the coupled one ( @xmath119 ) results in a significant decrease in the gate fidelity .",
    "analogously , we find that applying the control field optimized for the case of a one - particle environment ( @xmath42 ) to systems with @xmath247 environmental particles also has a strong detrimental effect on the gate fidelity",
