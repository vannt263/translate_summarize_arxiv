    "the interplay between disorder and nonlinearity has attracted the attention of physicists for more than twenty years .",
    "the latest advancements in experimental techniques and computational facilities have brought about a new peak of interest in the problem and already led to a wider understanding of the corresponding phenomena @xcite .",
    "physical properties of disordered nonlinear systems reveal much more sensitivity to the details of the formulation of the problem than their linear counterparts . for example , in nonlinear systems there exist three different transmission regimes : beside the exponential decrease of the transmission coefficient with the length of the disordered segment @xcite ( which is the sole possibility in the linear case ) , power law decrease can occur @xcite , and , in the case of sufficiently strong nonlinearity , the transmission coefficient may not even decrease at all @xcite .",
    "one of the main concepts in the theory of nonlinear waves is a concept of a soliton @xcite  a particle - like stable nonlinear excitation observed in many nonlinear physical systems .",
    "a particular example revealing the reciprocal action between the nonlinearity and disorder is a soliton propagation in random media .",
    "one can observe here an entire plethora of problems which differ from each other by ( i ) the type of nonlinearity ( e.g. nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , sine - gordon equation @xcite , so - called @xmath0-system @xcite ) , ( ii ) the way in which randomness enters the system ( e.g. in the random potential form @xcite , dispersive terms @xcite , nonlinear terms @xcite , external force @xcite ) , ( iii ) random structure of corresponding coefficients ( e.g. randomly distributed localized impurities @xcite or finite - range inhomogeneities @xcite ) , and ( iv ) the statistics of the disorder potential like e.g. white or colored gaussian potential @xcite or random step - wise process @xcite . a noticeable share of the above mentioned papers is devoted to the soliton transmission through a 1d disordered segment in the framework of nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "the latter is a ubiquitous nonlinear model appearing in many areas of contemporary physics . in the condensed matter physics nlse",
    "occurs for example in the description of weakly nonlinear magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets with the easy - axis type anisotropy @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the main models in the nonlinear fiber optics and the nonlinear fiber arrays @xcite .",
    "a prominent features of the nlse model is that in homogeneous ( ordered ) systems , this equation is completely integrable and possesses stable robust soliton solutions @xcite .    among the most common and widely explored sources of disorder",
    "are randomly distributed point - like scatterers which emulate the random short - scale imperfection of a media @xcite .",
    "when the concentration of scatterers is small , that is to say the mean distance between scatterers is much larger than the size of a soliton ( i.e. the case of `` sparse scatterers '' ) , the transmission of the soliton through a disordered segment can be considered as a sequence of individual events of passing through a single scatterer . after each act of scattering",
    ", the transmitted soliton acquires an abrupt shift of its position as well as a change of both its energy and velocity ( i.e. the scattering is generally inelastic ) .",
    "these changes influence the transmission characteristics of the soliton traversing through the total length of a sample , e.g. the time needed for the soliton to pass the entire segment ( we call it a `` transmission time '' here ) .",
    "assuming that the scattering is weak one can postulate that a soliton passing through a single scatterer , experiences only a slight change of its parameters , the measure of this `` slightness '' being the intensity of a scatterer .",
    "a single act of such a scattering was treated in detail in @xcite within the framework of perturbation theory @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where it was considered within another approach ) . when the perturbation method is applied , the resulting mapping mechanism for the soliton parameters is often called an `` equivalent particle approach '' due to the similarity of the resulting effect with the classical particle scattering @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the statistics of the soliton transmission time @xmath1 through a 1d disordered segment in the framework of nlse .",
    "more precisely , we address the delay for the transmission time of an incident soliton , @xmath2 , occurring due to the presence of sparse random scatterers .",
    "note , that often in the context of nonlinear optics the role of time is played by the spatial coordinate along the propagation of the optical beam , so for the so - called spatial solitons @xcite this delay , @xmath2 , should be endowed with a different physical meaning .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the scattering itself is considered to be weak and a perturbative approach can be applied for the description of the soliton dynamics . in the first order with respect to weak scattering intensity , @xmath3 , the time delay is related only to the shift in the soliton position after each scatterer .",
    "the corresponding total delay , @xmath2 , is then proportional to the number of scatterers within the segment ( and hence the segment length @xmath4 ) . on the other hand , the second order effects ,",
    "i.e. those of the order of @xmath5 , bring about the change of the soliton velocity , and their corresponding contribution is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore in the case of sufficiently long segment ( the relevant inequalities will be given in the text ) , the latter contribution dominates , and the overall transmission delay should be calculated using the second order approximation with respect to the scatterer intensity .",
    "we develop here a simple but yet robust mathematical formalism allowing one to obtain the mean value , @xmath7 , and variance , @xmath8 , of the fluctuating transmission time delay .",
    "some preliminary results concerning these first two moment have been published in @xcite .",
    "but in the current paper not only we provide a detailed description of the method for the moments but also present the exact probability density , @xmath9 , and the probability @xmath10 that the delay does not exceed a given value @xmath11 .",
    "such an approach has a certain merit on its own and can be used in the variety of similar random transmission problems where the velocity mapping between the two adjacent segments is given .",
    "it is pertinent to stress that in the current paper we consider the case of weak intensities of local inhomogeneities satisfying the inequality : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the typical number of scatterers .",
    "thus the parameters of the transmitting soliton ( i.e. its amplitude and velocity ) change weakly , the measure of this weakness being the aforementioned parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this case is somewhat opposite to that considered in refs.@xcite , where the limit @xmath15 was implied so that the limiting values of the soliton parameters differ significantly from their initial values .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start with brief reminder of the basic properties of a nlse soliton , consider soliton scattering on a single defect and recall the known expressions for the energy and the number of emitted quasiparticles ( subsection [ subsec : general ] ) used to obtain the formulas for velocity transformation ( subsection [ subsec : transf ] ) . our statistical model of randomly placed scatterers",
    "is introduced in section [ sec : model ] , where we describe the exact ( non - perturbative ) method for the calculation of various ensemble averages .",
    "this method is then applied in section [ sec : transm - many ] to the problem of soliton transmission through a disordered segment : we analyze dynamics of the soliton passing trough the segment ( subsection [ subsec : dynam ] ) , and obtain general expressions for the mean transmission time delay and its variance ( subsection [ subsec : meanvalue ] ) .",
    "the limiting case of weak scatterers is the subject of subsection [ subsec : weakscat ] : here we obtain simple explicit formulas for the mean value and variance of the transmission time delay for both light and heavy solitons and estimate the length of the segment where second order contribution dominates over the first order one .",
    "the statistical properties of the delay time are studied in section [ sec : delay ] . in its first part ( subsection [ subsec : gf ] ) we provide general formulas for various averages .",
    "the main result of this section is an explicit formula for the probability density function of transmission time delay obtained in subsection [ subsec : pdf ] . in the last subsection [ subsec : mandp ] we present the probability that delay does not exceed a given value .",
    "the results obtained are summarized in conclusion .",
    "appendices [ sec : numenergy]-[sec : equiv ] contain the technical details of the calculations .",
    "in this subsection we briefly recall some known results concerning the nlse soliton transmission through the single weak point - like scatterer . corresponding perturbed nlse in the normalized dimensionless units reads @xcite : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the complex field variable and the subscripts denote the partial derivatives with respect to time @xmath18 and spatial coordinate @xmath19 . the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "describes the influence of a single point scatterer with the intensity @xmath3 placed at origin .",
    "let us mention again that in some systems ( like e.g. for the spatial solitons in planar waveguides ) the physical meaning of independent variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 may be different .",
    "also the meaning of the field variable @xmath20 depends on the nature of the problem in hand : it can denote e.g. the deviation of the magnetization from the `` easy '' axis in ferromagnets or the envelope of the electromagnetic wave in optical fibers etc .",
    "the unperturbed nlse , i.e. when we set @xmath21 in eq.([nlse - single ] ) , is completely integrable and possesses an infinite set of integrals of motion @xcite , including total energy @xmath22 and the total number of bound waves ( quasiparticles ) @xmath23 .",
    "the simplest one - soliton solution of nlse reads as @xcite :    @xmath24\\right\\ } }      { \\cosh\\left [      a(x+vt)-{\\varphi}_1      \\right]}\\ ] ]    and depends on four real parameters : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we choose the soliton amplitude @xmath25 ( which also characterizes its spatial size ) , and velocity @xmath26 to be positive .",
    "such a selection corresponds to a soliton propagating in the negative direction of the @xmath19 axis .",
    "assuming the solution in the form of a single - soliton anstz , eq .",
    "( [ one - sol ] ) , the number of quasiparticles @xmath29 bounded in the soliton ( [ one - sol ] ) and soliton energy @xmath30 are given by    @xmath31    ) ]    in what follows we distinguish between the cases of `` light '' and `` heavy '' soliton .",
    "the particular type of the soliton is governed by dimensionless parameter :    @xmath32    we name a soliton the amplitude of which is mush less than its velocity , @xmath33 , a light soliton .",
    "correspondingly heavy solitons are those for which the inverse inequality is satisfied , @xmath34 . this difference can be seen in fig.[fig_1 ] : the region marked as ( a ) corresponds to the light solitons while regions ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to the heavy ones .",
    "the properties of light solitons are very close to those of a linear wave packet : almost all of its ( positive ) energy is contained in the first term in the r.h.s . of eq.([ints-0 ] ) ( i.e. in its kinetic energy ) .",
    "on the contrary , a heavy soliton behaves mostly like a classical particle and its ( negative ) energy is concentrated mainly in the second term in the r.h.s . of eq.([ints-0 ] ) .",
    "it means that the energy of the nonlinear interaction of the quasiparticles bound in the heavy soliton significantly exceeds their kinetic energy , and the opposite is true for the light solitons .",
    "consider now a soliton incident at @xmath35 from the right ( i.e. from @xmath36 ) and characterized by the amplitude @xmath25 , velocity @xmath26 ( or equivalently by the number of quasiparticles @xmath37 and energy @xmath38 ( [ ints-0 ] ) ) , and also by the phases @xmath39 . as noted above , in this paper we will deal with the case of weak scatterers where the dimensionless scatterer intensity is small , and the ratio @xmath40 is the main small parameter of the problem .",
    "then one can resort to perturbation theory @xcite to describe the change of the soliton parameters after each act of scattering .",
    "the exhaustive perturbative study of the soliton transmission over a single delta - scatterer was carried out in refs .",
    "it was shown that in the case of attractive scatterer , @xmath41 , the soliton becomes trapped in an effective potential well created by such an impurity and then experiences oscillatory motion in the vicinity of the scatterer . in the case of sufficiently strong repulsive scatterer , when the two inequalities @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fulfilled , the soliton is always reflected by the scatterer ( the region of parameters corresponds to the upper right sector in fig . [ fig_1 ] ) .",
    "the soliton can pass through the scatterer only in the case of comparatively weak repulsive interaction , and in our current study we assume that the following inequalities hold :    @xmath44    we distinguish two cases : i ) a fast soliton , with parameters falling into the two marked regions , ( a ) and ( b ) in fig.[fig_1 ] , where the strong version of inequality ( [ passing ] ) is valid : @xmath45 and ii ) a slow soliton , where together with eq.([passing ] ) we have @xmath46 ( region ( c ) showed schematically by dashed lines in fig.[fig_1 ] ) .",
    "as one can easily see , in the case of weak scatterers , @xmath47 , the light soliton is always fast , while the heavy soliton can be either fast ( region ( b ) or slow ( region ( c ) ) .    in the first order with respect to dimensionless scatterer intensity @xmath3 , at @xmath48 the amplitude , velocity , the number of particles and energy of the soliton remain unchanged .",
    "the only changes are in the phases : @xmath49 @xmath50 . here and further on the primes will denote soliton parameters after scattering . these changes can be readily calculated @xcite and as a result the position of the soliton center is asymptotically shifted back as compared to the unperturbed propagation of the soliton with the unchanged constant velocity @xmath26 . the overall value of the backward coordinate shift ( in the adiabatic approximation ) is given by    @xmath51    for a slow soliton the additional shift of soliton position @xmath52 is of the order of its width @xmath53 , and for a fast soliton this shift @xmath54 .",
    "since in the first order in @xmath3 ( adiabatic approximation ) the amplitude @xmath25 and the velocity @xmath26 of the soliton do not change , its energy @xmath38 and the number of bound particles @xmath37 do not change either ( see eq.([ints-0 ] ) ) and there is no emission of quasiparticles from the soliton .",
    "but in the second order in @xmath3 ( or rather @xmath55 as will be seen later ) , the solution at @xmath48 represents the transmitted soliton together with a number of quasilinear excitations carrying the number of waves @xmath23 and energy @xmath22 .",
    "the amplitude and velocity of a scattered soliton do change now : @xmath56 and so do the number of bound quasiparticles , @xmath57 , and the energy , @xmath58 .",
    "all the parameters describing the incident and scattered solution are related via the conservation laws for total number of quasiparticles and the total energy :    @xmath59    in the case of slow soliton the spectra of emitted quasiparticles can only be obtained numerically .",
    "however it appears that such a limit ( when the position shift is of the order of the soliton width ) is not a physical one . on the contrary ,",
    "the case of fast soliton admits a detailed analytical description . here",
    "the problem of emission of linear excitations can be solved perturbatively @xcite . in the second order of the perturbation theory the number of emitted quasiparticles and their energy",
    "have been calculated explicitly : the corresponding results in the cases of heavy and light soliton look rather different @xcite . as was mentioned above",
    ", a heavy soliton behaves like a classical particle and the total number and energy of quasiparticles emitted by such a soliton are exponentially small :    @xmath60    the behavior of a light soliton more or less mimics that of a linear wave packet . in the leading approximation in @xmath61 ,",
    "the expressions for the number and energy of quasiparticles emitted by a light soliton are as follows :    @xmath62      by virtue of eqs .",
    "( [ conserv ] ) - ( [ newintegrals-3 ] ) one can express the energy change , @xmath63 , and the change of the number of quasiparticles , @xmath64 , via their emitted values .",
    "however the natural kinematic characteristics of the fast soliton are its amplitude and velocity .",
    "now by means of the results of previous subsection we can obtain the mapping for the fast soliton amplitude and velocity during an act of scattering on a single defect . according to eqs .",
    "( [ ints-0 ] ) , ( [ conserv ] ) the small changes of the soliton parameters after the scattering are given by ( see ref.@xcite ) :    @xmath65    these relations determine the relative change of soliton amplitude and velocity    @xmath66    yielding the following evident velocity and amplitude transformation rules :    @xmath67,\\ ] ]    @xmath68    see ref.@xcite .",
    "a continuous version of these equations was obtained in refs.@xcite .    in the case of fast heavy soliton , where the inequalities are @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ", we can use the explicit expressions for the number @xmath23 and the energy @xmath22 of emitted quasiparticles ( [ newintegrals-2 ] ) mentioned in the previous section [ subsec : general ] . here the last term in the second of eqs .",

    "therefore the next terms in expansions of eqs .",
    "( [ newintegrals-3 ] ) should be taken into account .",
    "corresponding calculations are performed in appendix [ sec : numenergy ] , and the eventual results are the following :    @xmath74 , \\qquad      e\\simeq\\frac{{\\varepsilon}^2 a}{2 }      \\left[1-\\frac{4a^2}{3v^{2}}+\\textit{o}\\left(\\frac{a^4}{v^{4}}\\right ) \\right ] , \\ \\ \\ \\ a\\ll v.\\ ] ]    for velocity and amplitude transformation in the case of light soliton one obtains :    @xmath75    generally , accounting for the results above the mapping rule can be represented in a unified way :",

    "also the velocity change in both cases contains an additional parameter @xmath80 .",
    "thus the velocity change essentially exceeds the amplitude change for a heavy soliton , and is much smaller than the amplitude change for a light soliton .",
    "let us note that the results very similar to eqs .",
    "( [ unified])-([unified-2 ] ) but for the different model of lengthy segment of random media were obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us now introduce disorder into the system and proceed from a single scatterer ( defect ) to a system of many scatterers with random positions and intensities .",
    "the nlse for the system with many scatterers takes the form :    @xmath81    the r.h.s . of eq.([nlse - rand ] ) describes the influence of the point scatterers with random intensities @xmath82 , placed at random positions @xmath83 .",
    "we will consider the statistical properties of these quantities separately , starting with the intensities .",
    "let us consider the intensities of the defects as the mutually independent random variables with the common probability density function , @xmath84 , and hence the same two first moments : @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( the bar denotes averaging with the probability density @xmath84 ) .",
    "we assume here that the distribution of @xmath3 is not extremely exotic so that @xmath85 and @xmath87 are of the same order of magnitude",
    ". the squared intensity of the @xmath88-th scatterer can be also characterized by a dimensionless parameter :    @xmath89    evidently , the first moment now @xmath90 , and all second moments are equal to the same value @xmath91 the parameter @xmath92 is of the order of @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the width of the probability density function .      as for the spatial distribution of the defects , we will assume that they are distributed _ independently and uniformly _ within the segment @xmath95 $ ] with the mean distance @xmath96 between the adjacent scatterers .",
    "the number @xmath13 of defects on the segment @xmath97 $ ] is random , and the probability @xmath98 to find exactly @xmath13 defects within the segment , is taken to be poissonian :    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the average number of defects on the segment .",
    "let us consider the probability density to find exactly @xmath13 scatterers at the points @xmath83 , where we ordered the positions : @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the new dimensionless variables :    @xmath103    see the scheme given in fig.2 .",
    "now the aforementioned probability reads as :    @xmath104    [ fig_2 ]      the dynamical quantities of the problem are described by various functions which depend on the number @xmath13 , set of positions @xmath105 , and intensities @xmath106 of the scatterers . in this subsection",
    "we will present a simple and universal method of calculating the arbitrary averages over the intensities and poisson - distributed positions of the scatterers .",
    "again , the averaging with respect to intensities of the scatterers is denoted by an overline :    @xmath107    now , to distinguish between the intensity and position averaging the symbol @xmath108 will be used for canonical averaging with respect to positions of the scatterers :    @xmath109    by `` canonical '' averaging we mean the averaging over all the realizations where exactly @xmath13 scatterers occur inside the segment @xmath97 $ ] . using the analogy with the notions of statistical mechanics we can introduce the `` grand canonical averaging '' over all the realizations having different number of scatterers with the weights given by eq.([p - n ] ) .",
    "the grand canonical averaging will be denoted by a single pair of angular brackets without the subscript @xmath13 :    @xmath110    double angular brackets will denote the total averaging :    @xmath111    in what follows it is useful to recall the expressions for the first two moments of the poissonian distribution : @xmath112    we can also obtain the first two canonical moments of the distance between the scatterers :    @xmath113    to obtain the latter quantities we have used the following trick .",
    "one starts with the well known integral representation for the theta - function , @xmath114 ( the contour @xmath115 in the complex plane @xmath116 is the line @xmath117 ) .",
    "then it is possible to interchange the order of the contour integration and the integration over all @xmath118 .",
    "note that this trick comes handy for calculating arbitrary canonical averages , not only the first moments .",
    "in this section we consider the transmission time of a soliton passing through a disordered segment and calculate the mean value and variance of the transmission time shift .",
    "it is important to mention that in the following analysis we account for the linear radiation only when applying the transformation formulas , eqs .",
    "( [ unified ] ) .",
    "however we neglect all the secondary effects relevant to the multiply reflections of the radiation emitted previously by the soliton and the weak recurrent action of these waives on the overall soliton dynamics .",
    "let @xmath119 be the initial velocity of the soliton incident from the right on the segment @xmath97 $ ] . in the absence of scatterers",
    "the transmission time would be @xmath120 .",
    "the inclusion of random scatterers brings about two effects .",
    "first , the effective distance between the adjacent scatterers increases because of the backward shift of the soliton position .",
    "we denote such a backward position shift at the @xmath88-th scatterer as @xmath121 .",
    "second , a small deceleration of the soliton occurs after each act of scattering , which also increases the transmission time .",
    "let @xmath122 , @xmath123 be the velocity of soliton incident ( from the right ) on the @xmath88-th scatterer , and @xmath124  the velocity of the soliton after passing through the last @xmath13-th scatterer ( note that the sequence of velocities @xmath125 monotonically decreases , @xmath126 ) . since the soliton propagates from right to left ( i.e. from @xmath127 to @xmath128 ) , we assume that @xmath129 denotes the absolute value of the velocity .",
    "the total soliton transmission time @xmath130 through the disordered segment containing @xmath13 scatterers is :    @xmath131    where the meaning of the quantities @xmath132 and @xmath133 is following .",
    "by @xmath132 we have designated the quantity : @xmath134 so it is the contribution to the transmission time delay related to the backward position shift .",
    "this delay , @xmath132 , according to eq .",
    "( [ centershift - gen ] ) can be expressed as :    @xmath135    it follows from eq.([veltransf-1 ] ) and eq.([veltransf-2 ] ) that @xmath136 , so that in the leading approximation in @xmath3 one can substitute @xmath137 for all the parameters @xmath129 .",
    "then we arrive at the expression : @xmath138 and the final result for the first order contribution to the delay time is : @xmath139 the last term in the r.h.s . of eq.([t ] ) , @xmath133 , is as follows :    @xmath140    so it describes the delay which occurs due to the soliton deceleration after each act of scattering .",
    "it is written in the most general form and as such describes the propagation time of an arbitrary classical particle traversing through a disordered segment and obeying some given velocity transformation rules .",
    "therefore the following analysis of this contribution in the current and following sections is applicable to any classical particle moving according to a given monotonically decreasing velocity mapping .",
    "note that the velocity deceleration need not be small for the validity of the method  only the positiveness of the velocity is important .",
    "we note that the intermediate calculations and final results also look simpler in the general form rather than in the form of expansion in the limit of small @xmath55 .",
    "the latter limit is considered only in the subsection [ subsec : weakscat ] , where we obtain and analyze the mean value and the variance of the transmission time delay for a fast soliton .    in the dimensionless variables",
    "eq.([secondorder-0 ] ) can be recast as :    @xmath141    the statistical analysis of the shift @xmath133 is more complicated than that of @xmath132 and the rest of the paper is dedicated to the former . as we will see below this contribution dominates for long enough segments with the large average number of scatterers .",
    "therefore in what follows we will omit the subscript  2 \" and write simply @xmath142 implying the quantity @xmath133 unless specified otherwise .",
    "the corresponding delay depends on the number @xmath13 of the scatterers and on their realization , i.e. on the two sets of parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( the latter enters through the velocities @xmath129 ) . indeed according to eqs .",
    "( [ unified ] ) , the change of velocities is described by the set of recurrent relations : @xmath145,\\ ] ] which actually gives @xmath146 as a function of an input velocity @xmath137 , input amplitude @xmath147 and fluctuations @xmath148 of intensities",
    "@xmath149 of all scatterers @xmath150 preceding ( from the right ) the scatterer with the number @xmath88 ,    @xmath151    we emphasize again that in the case considered , the soliton behaves as a classical particle that moves with a constant velocity between the scatterers . the corresponding dimensionless transmission time shift ,    @xmath152    is expressed via the natural dynamic variables :    @xmath153    which are nothing else but dimensionless shifts of the inverse velocities after passing through the last @xmath154 scatterers .",
    "thus we see that the fluctuations of intensities and positions of the scatterers in eq .",
    "( [ tau-1 ] ) are decoupled : accounting for eq .",
    "( [ veltransf ] ) the former enter only through the variables @xmath155 while the geometric disorder enters directly through the dimensionless distances @xmath118 between the adjacent scatterers .",
    "because the velocities form a monotonically decreasing sequence , the sequence @xmath155 also decreases : @xmath156 .",
    "( [ tau-1 ] ) it follows that the shift @xmath157 does not exceed the value @xmath158 :    @xmath159    the maximum of the transmission time occurs in the configuration where all the scatterers are concentrated at the point of incidence ( all @xmath160 ) so that the soliton always moves with the minimal velocity @xmath124 .",
    "the minimal shift equals zero and corresponds to the opposite configuration where all the scatterers are concentrated at the farther end of the segment ( all @xmath161 ) and the soliton always moves with its initial ( maximal ) velocity @xmath162 .",
    "the statistical properties of the dimensionless transmission time shift , eq.([tau-1 ] ) , are the main subject of our paper",
    ". we will show that within the framework of the classical `` particle '' model one can construct a complete statistical description of the transmission time delay and obtain a general expression for its probability density function .",
