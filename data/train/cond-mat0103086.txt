    "granular matter @xcite consists of small or large macroscopic particles . when out of equilibrium , its dynamics is controlled by dissipative interactions , and distinguished in quasi - static flows or granular solids on the one hand , and rapid flows or granular fluids @xcite on the other hand .",
    "typical realizations of granular solids are sand piles , avalanches , saturn s rings , grain silos , stress distributions . here",
    "particles remain essentially in contact , and the dynamics is controlled by gravity , friction and surface roughness . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on granular fluids .",
    "typical examples are driven granular flows , such as poisseuille flow @xcite , vibrated beds @xcite , or rapid flows with some form of continuous energy input @xcite . here",
    "the dynamics is controlled by inelastic binary collisions , separated by ballistic motion of the particles .",
    "the forces are of short range and repulsive , and the system is frequently modelled as a collection of smooth inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) @xcite of diameter @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 .",
    "momentum is conserved during collisions , which makes the system a fluid , but energy is not conserved . in a collision , on average ,",
    "a fraction @xmath2 of the relative kinetic energy of the colliding pair is lost , where @xmath2 is referred to as the degree of inelasticity . in the literature @xcite @xmath3 , usually expressed in terms of the coefficient of restitution @xmath4 .",
    "its detailed definition does not concerns us here .    here",
    "we focus on the idealized limiting case of a freely evolving rapid flow without energy input and with nearly elastic collisions , and therefore slowly cooling .",
    "this system shows @xcite an interesting instability .",
    "when prepared in a spatially homogeneous equilibrium state , the system does not stay there , but slowly develops patterns , both in the flow field ( vortices ) , and in the density field ( clusters ) , the so called clustering instability . for the two - dimensional case",
    "the analogies with spinodal decomposition have already been pointed out in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the search for the proper macroscopic description of unstable granular fluids has been pursued by many authors  [ 1 - 13,18,20,22 - 32 ] .",
    "recently , two new points of view have been presented , namely by ben - naim et al .",
    "@xcite and by soto et al .",
    "the first one needs to be discussed in more detail because macroscopic equations for granular fluids like the burgers equation appear in that paper , as well as in the present one .",
    "these authors conjecture that the ( vector ) burgers equation describes the flow velocity @xmath5 of a granular fluid , or at least of a dilute granular gas the authors are not very explicit on this point@xcite on large space and time scales for _ arbitrary _ values of the inelasticity ( @xmath6 ) in @xmath7dimensions , i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinematic viscosity , and the solutions of interest have to satisfy @xmath10 .",
    "an interesting aside is that the rotation - free solution of the vector burgers equation can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 satisfies the equation , @xmath13 this equation is the famous kpz - equation , named after khadar , parisi and zhang @xcite .",
    "it describes the growth dynamics of solid surfaces , where @xmath14 is the height function .",
    "it is well known that the burgers equation in the inviscid limit ( @xmath15 ) describes the `` sticky dust '' or adhesion model of _ perfectly inelastic point _ particles with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the conjectured validity of the burgers equation for the inelastic hard sphere fluid implies a universality hypothesis , i.e. the large @xmath17behavior of a granular gas is in the universality class of sticky dust , independent of its inelasticity @xmath2 .",
    "several implications of this conjecture in dimensions @xmath18 have been criticized in ref  @xcite . for the one - dimensional case the authors present rather convincing evidence based on molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using @xmath19 particles , and on scaling arguments .",
    "in addition , boldyrev  @xcite has studied the one - dimensional randomly driven burgers equation with a pressure term @xmath20 with @xmath21 included .",
    "he has shown that properties , like the structure factor or pair correlation function , are not affected by the pressure term if @xmath22 . on account of this argument",
    ", the @xmath23-term in the one - dimensional navier - stokes equation can be neglected on the largest @xmath24 scales for a dilute gas in the inviscid limit , making the burgers equation the appropriate macroscopic equation .",
    "note that in the freely cooling granular fluid the viscosity decreases as @xmath25 as @xmath26 . in higher dimensions the systems used in md simulations ( @xmath27 in two dimensions  @xcite and @xmath19 in three dimensions  @xcite )",
    "are too small to draw any conclusions on large scale behavior . here",
    "analytic or scaling arguments to support the conjecture are lacking .",
    "although equations of the form ( [ burgers ] ) will frequently appear in the present paper , we emphasize that ref .",
    "@xcite refers only to the largest possible scales ( where the thermodynamic limit has been taken ) . in this paper",
    "we explicitly restrict ourselves to small systems in order to suppress the clustering instability .",
    "this has been done to simplify the problem .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite only refers to dilute granular gases , whereas this paper covers also liquid densities .    a second new development , which is somewhat similar to ours , is given by soto et al .",
    "these authors also study granular fluids , contained in systems that are sufficiently small , such that the clustering instability is suppressed . in these small systems",
    "the growth of vortices is very slow .",
    "consequently , the remaining hydrodynamic modes are enslaved by the slowly growing unstable vorticity modes and the amplitude of these vorticity modes remains very small . under this condition",
    ", they obtained the amplitude equations for the slowest vorticity modes , which can be derived from a potential function .",
    "the question of interest in the present paper is : can the models for granular fluids be fitted into the generic classification of landau  ginzburg  type models , as given by hohenberg and halperin  @xcite , to describe critical dynamics and hydrodynamic instabilities ?",
    "the goal of this article is to illustrate how , under certain restrictions , the standard nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for the ihs fluid @xcite can be cast into a landau  ginzburg  type equation of motion for the order parameter , which can be derived from an energy functional and , more specifically , to point out which terms in the original hydrodynamic equations are responsible for the quartic terms in the landau - ginzburg energy functional .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we start with the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the decay of the total energy at short times and the results of a linear stability analysis are briefly reviewed . in sec.3",
    ", we introduce an assumption of incompressible flows under certain restrictions on system size or time regime .",
    "then , under these assumptions , the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to a closed equation for a scaled flow field .",
    "it is shown in sec.4 that this equation for a scaled flow field can be cast into the form of a time ",
    "dependent landau ",
    "ginzburg equation for an appropriate order parameter .",
    "the shape of the energy functional is discussed and possible stationary solutions are presented . finally , in sec.5 , we make a quantitative comparison of the theoretical predictions at large times with molecular dynamics simulations of inelastic hard disks .",
    "we end with some conclusions in sec.6 .",
    "the starting point are the hydrodynamic equations . they are not only needed here to recapitulate our present theoretical understanding of this system , but also to formulate the new extensions to be discussed in this paper .",
    "the macroscopic time evolution of the ihs fluid on large spatial and temporal scales @xcite can be described by the nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for the local density @xmath28 , the local flow field @xmath29 and the local temperature @xmath30 , supplemented with a sink term @xmath31 accounting for the energy loss through inelastic collisions , i.e. @xmath32 in this paper the inelasticity is always assumed to be small . for later convenience the macroscopic equations",
    "are given for a @xmath33-dimensional systems .",
    "here @xmath34 is the time derivative in a comoving frame .",
    "the local energy density of the ihs fluid is @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the pressure .",
    "the shear rate @xmath37 is the symmetrized dyadic , @xmath38 , which is also made traceless .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 is proportional to the heat conductivity @xmath40 , and @xmath41 to the shear viscosity @xmath9 . for simplicity of presentation",
    "the bulk viscosity has been set equal to zero , and the transport coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath40 , which depend on the local density and temperature , are taken at some fixed reference values , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , to be specified later .",
    "the four terms in the energy balance equation account for work done by the pressure , for heat conduction , for nonlinear viscous heating and collisional dissipation .",
    "gradients in the flow velocity considerably slow down the collisional cooling process through viscous heating .    on the basis of kinetic theory",
    "one can derive that the rate of collisional energy loss , @xmath44 , is proportional to the collision frequency @xmath45 multiplied by the fraction of energy @xmath46 lost per collision @xcite , where @xmath47 .",
    "in general , the collision frequency @xmath48 is proportional to the root mean square velocity @xmath49 , and its explicit form for hard sphere fluids can be found in refs .",
    "when the system is prepared initially in a homogeneous equilibrium state , it evolves at short times in a spatially homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) with a time dependent temperature .",
    "combination of eqs .",
    "( [ ns ] ) and the expression for @xmath31 given above , yields @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to haff s homogeneous cooling law  @xcite for the mean energy per particle in the ihs fluid , @xmath51 which is needed for later comparison . here",
    "@xmath52 is the initial energy , and @xmath53 with @xmath54 is the mean free time in the initial state . in general",
    "the number of collisions per particle @xmath55 in a time @xmath56 is defined through @xmath57 . in the hcs integration of this relation",
    "yields @xmath58 .    however , this state is unstable against spatial fluctuations in density @xmath59 , temperature @xmath30 and flow velocity @xmath60 .",
    "the present theoretical understanding of these instabilities @xcite is essentially based on a linear stability analysis of the hydrodynamic fluctuations in the density , @xmath61 , temperature , @xmath62 , and flow velocity @xmath63 .",
    "this is done by using the rescaled fourier modes @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where an overline denotes a spatial average , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the global granular temperature .",
    "fourier transforms are defined as @xmath69 .",
    "the rescaled eigenmodes are described by @xmath70 .",
    "the exponential growth rates of unstable ( @xmath71 ) and stable ( @xmath72 ) modes are shown in fig .  1 as a function of the wave number @xmath73 .",
    "this figure shows that the transverse flow field @xmath74 or shear mode ( @xmath75 ) with a wave number @xmath76 is unstable , and develops vortices . on the other hand density fluctuations couple weakly , in order @xmath77 , to the heat modes ( @xmath78 ) , and @xmath79 in fig.1 shows that these fluctuations are unstable in the range @xmath80 , and linearly stable in the range @xmath81 , i.e. remain at thermal noise level .",
    "the stability thresholds @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined as the the root of @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and are marked as black dots in the figure .",
    "the figure also shows that the growth rate @xmath86 for the vorticity mode is much larger than the growth rate for the heat mode @xmath87 , which couples to the density fluctuations .",
    "this explains why vortices appear long before the density clusters start to appear .",
    "an intuitive explanation for the appearance and growth of large scale vortices is that a binary collision destroys a fraction of the kinetic energy of relative motion of the colliding pair .",
    "the cumulative effect of many successive collisions is that they make the particles move locally in a more parallel and coherent fashion .",
    "this creates locally patches of vorticity .",
    "these patches grow in size by selective suppression ( stronger damping ) of short wavelength modes  @xcite .",
    "an intuitive explanation of the appearance of high density clusters goes as follows @xcite .",
    "suppose one prepares the system initially in a spatially homogeneous equilibrium state , and there occurs locally a spontaneous negative pressure fluctuation ( ` depression ' ) .",
    "the resulting particle flow from the surroundings tries to compensate for the local depression .",
    "this creates an excess local density , which increases the collision frequency , and in turn decreases the temperature .",
    "this creates again a depression , and the process keeps repeating itself , thus creating cold dense clusters , surrounded by a hot dilute gas .",
    "moreover , these arguments also suggest that the pressure fluctuations and the corresponding gradients remain substantially smaller than those in density and temperature .",
    "in fact it would be very interesting if one could test this suggestion by measuring the pressure _ locally _ , i.e.  in cells of the typical size of a density cluster , through molecular dynamics simulations , or direct monte carlo simulations ( dsmc ) of the boltzmann or enskog equation , or by the lattice boltzmann method .",
    "the shape of the dispersion relations for the growth rates also explains the suppression of instabilities through a reduction of the system size @xcite .",
    "let @xmath88 be the smallest wave number , allowed in a system of linear extent @xmath89 at fixed density and with periodic boundary conditions . in systems with @xmath90 , there are growing vorticity modes , but all density fluctuations are stable according to a linear stability analysis . in systems with @xmath91",
    "the fluctuations in the density and in the flow field are unstable  @xcite .",
    "however , systems with @xmath92 do not show any instability .",
    "the smallest allowed wave numbers @xmath93 for different numbers of particles , @xmath94 at fixed packing fraction @xmath95 , are shown as stars in fig.1 .",
    "this information on small systems will be used in later sections .",
    "we finally remark that several authors have also studied nonlinear terms in the macroscopic equations for granular fluids , such as the viscous _ heating _ term @xcite , and the nonlinear convective term @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the combined effects of viscous heating and collisional cooling is essentially the new mechanism driving the dynamics of dissipative granular fluids in the time regime , directly following the homogeneous cooling state .    in an unpublished report @xcite one of us",
    "has developed a systematic expansion method for solving the nonlinear hydrodynamic equations for granular fluids .",
    "the method is based on the separation of time scales of the relatively slow process of vorticity diffusion and the relatively fast process of heat conduction for all @xmath73-dependent excitations , allowed in the system ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with the relative sizes of the growth rates @xmath97 and @xmath98 , as shown in fig . 1",
    ".    the separation of the time scales permits a systematic approximation scheme , based on the chapman - enskog method or multi - time scale expansion method  @xcite . in zeroth order",
    "this method yields a closed equation of motion for the rescaled flow field @xmath99 , as well as an equation for the global granular temperature @xmath100 . in first approximation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) this method yields equations for the density and temperature fluctuations , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and a higher order correction to the navier - stokes equation .",
    "in the present paper we will not explain the rather technical calculations based on the multi - time scale method , but we will try to elucidate the essential physics by deriving the zeroth order results in a more intuitive fashion . the systematic derivation will be published elsewhere .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , instabilities and pattern formation occur in two different local fields , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and on two different time scales , namely first patches of vorticity appear , and only much later density clusters appear .",
    "as explained above , the appearance of density clusters can even be further delayed , or all together suppressed by decreasing the system size @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest to analyze first the simplest case where fluctuations in density and temperature remain small .",
    "this would happen in the time regime following the unstable homogeneous cooling state , and possibly in the full time regime for sufficiently small systems , as suggested by the linear stability analysis .",
    "of course the stability of solutions on the largest time scales is determined by the full nonlinear equations .",
    "the conditions for small @xmath105 and @xmath106fluctuations might be realized in _",
    "incompressible _ flows , where @xmath107 .",
    "then the density remains constant in the comoving frame , and the temperature balance equation greatly simplifies . as is well known from standard fluid dynamics and from the theory of turbulence @xcite , flows of elastic fluids are quite _ incompressible_. this implies , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the longitudinal fourier mode .",
    "moreover , md simulations and the theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations in granular flows @xcite show that the incompressibility assumption , @xmath110 , remains valid down to very small wave numbers , satisfying @xmath111 , and ultimately breaks down at the largest wavelengths , where @xmath112 is the largest intrinsic dynamic correlation length in ihs fluid .",
    "it satisfies the inequality , @xmath113 for nearly elastic systems .",
    "both correlation lengths are indicated in fig.1 and defined more explicitly in @xcite .",
    "therefore , as a zeroth approximation to our nonlinear theory , we make the incompressibility assumption , @xmath114 , following refs .",
    "@xcite , and the equations of motion become , @xmath115:\\nabla{\\bf u }   - 2\\gamma_0\\omega t. \\label{nsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently @xmath59 is constant in a comoving frame , and the set of nonlinear equations ( [ nsi ] ) can not describe the growth of inhomogeneities in the density field , but supposedly describe the time evolution of the system as long as the density fluctuations are small .    as a consequence of the incompressibility assumption the local density stays constant in time , and neither depressions , nor hot and cold regions can develop . therefore , the pressure gradient in ( [ nsi ] ) remains negligibly small as well , and the navier - stokes equation becomes , @xmath116 where the flow velocity @xmath117 is purely rotational with @xmath118 .",
    "we also note that the divergence of eq.([ns2 ] ) , in combination with @xmath118 , reduces to @xmath119 at all times .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the burgers equation for a rotation - free flow field has been conjectured  @xcite as the large scale macroscopic equation for a d - dimensional dilute granular gas of arbitrary inelasticity @xmath2 .",
    "next we consider the temperature balance equation , which involves two processes : the diffusion process of heat conduction , where fourier modes @xmath120 decay with a rate @xmath121 , and the global process of collisional cooling and nonlinear viscous heating , describing the decay of @xmath120 for @xmath122 , or equivalently of @xmath123 , referred to as global temperature .    to split off the behavior of @xmath43 from eq.([nsi ] )",
    "we take the spatial average of the @xmath124equation , yielding for the global temperature , @xmath125 where overlines denote spatial averages .",
    "we have introduced the notation @xmath126 , for a second rank tensor @xmath127 .",
    "the transport coefficient @xmath128 and collision frequency @xmath45 are functions of the spatially average density @xmath129 and temperature @xmath130 ( see reference values below eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) ) .",
    "this is allowed as long as the local fluctuations @xmath131 and @xmath132 are not getting too large through nonlinear effects .",
    "the new evolution equations  ( [ ns2 ] ) and ( [ tbar ] ) contain the time dependent coefficients @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath9 , which are proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to introduce the scaled field @xmath136 , and the scaled time @xmath137 , defined as @xmath138 .",
    "the final macroscopic evolution equations then become , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the ( time - independent ) mean free path .",
    "the last equation is a closed equation for @xmath141 , and the physically consistent solutions need to obey the relation @xmath114 .",
    "the global temperature is slaved by the flow field .",
    "the rescaled vorticity diffusion coefficient , defined as @xmath142 , is independent of time . the first term on the right hand side of the equation for @xmath141 accounts for the instability , the second for the vorticity diffusion and the last one for the saturation effects , caused by the nonlinear viscous heating .",
    "it slows down the growth of unstable @xmath143-modes , and may ultimately lead to a steady state for @xmath141 . for large times",
    "the above equations ( [ ns2 ] ) and ( [ tbar ] ) are no longer valid , and nonlinear effects will induce density inhomogeneities , even in small systems with @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we will drop the nonlinear convective term @xmath144 , but at the end of our analysis we admit out of all possible solutions only those that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ reduced ] ) with the convective term included .",
    "the final equation for the rescaled @xmath145field has the form of the landau - ginzburg equation of motion for a _ non - conserved _ order parameter .",
    "this can be made more explicit by introducing the order parameter @xmath146 , and applying @xmath147 to the @xmath63-equation in ( [ reduced ] ) with the result , @xmath148 /\\delta { \\mbox{\\sf s}}^\\dag , \\label{landau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last line contains the functional derivative of the energy functional @xmath149 $ ] , defined as @xmath150 = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\gamma_0 \\overline{|{\\mbox{\\sf s}}|^2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } { \\cal d}_\\perp \\overline{|\\nabla{\\mbox{\\sf s}}|^2 } + \\frac{1}{2d } { \\cal d}_\\perp \\left(\\overline{|{\\mbox{\\sf s}}|^2}\\right)^2 . \\label{landauf}\\ ] ] in our further considerations it is more convenient to use fourier modes .",
    "moreover @xmath151 , because of the assumption of incompressibility , and @xmath152",
    ". then we obtain the equation of motion , @xmath153/\\delta { \\mbox{\\sf s}}_{\\bf k}^\\dag \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left\\{\\gamma_0-{\\cal d}_\\perp",

    "the energy in ( [ landauf ] ) and ( [ landaur ] ) resembles a landau free energy form for a _ tensorial order parameter _",
    "@xmath146 with tr@xmath155 , which is in fact the shear rate or rate of deformation tensor .",
    "it has a quartic term @xmath156 , and a quadratic term @xmath157 with a coefficient that vanishes at a critical threshold @xmath158 .",
    "it differs from the standard landau free energy in that the quartic term contains summations over two totally independent wave numbers .",
    "these results are very interesting .",
    "if the energy functional has a minimum , then there is a fixed point solution , @xmath159 , that is approached for large times .",
    "they are found by setting the right hand side of ( [ sk ] ) equal to zero , i.e. ,    @xmath160    we will show that depending on the parameter , @xmath161 , being above or below the threshold value @xmath162 , the fixed point value of the order parameter , @xmath163 , is _ vanishing _ or _ non - vanishing_. a stable fixed point with some non - vanishing fourier components indicates that the system approaches a non - equilibrium steady state with a stationary pattern in the flow field , and spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred .",
    "consider the right hand side of ( [ sk ] ) , and observe that the expression between curly brackets is necessarily _ negative _ for @xmath164 , and the fourier mode @xmath165 decays to zero .",

    "the system remains spatially homogeneous .",
    "however , if @xmath167 , then there exists the possibility that the expression inside brackets in eq.([sk ] ) vanishes for a non - vanishing value of @xmath168 , i.e.  there is an extremum determined by the condition , @xmath169 if the extremum is a saddle point then there are directions of exponentially growing solutions . however , if @xmath170 , then the right hand side of  ( [ velocityamp ] ) may become zero and even positive",
    ". there is the possibility of stationary and of exponentially growing solutions .",
    "the fixed point @xmath171 is a saddle point .",
    "one can also show @xcite that all fixed point solutions with non - vanishing @xmath165 for any @xmath172 are saddle points , and that the only non - vanishing solution @xmath173 is a stable fixed point with an infinitely degenerate minimum , given symbolically by the mexican hat shape as illustrated in fig .",
    "the condition ( [ velocityamp ] ) for @xmath174 with @xmath175 in @xmath33-dimensions is then @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 is a unit vector in the direction @xmath4 ( @xmath179 ) . as the solutions of these equations have to satisfy eq .",

    "for the two - dimensional case only _ two _ fixed point solutions remain , instead of infinitely many degenerate minima , i.e. @xmath189 the symmetry of the steady state is spontaneously broken , and spontaneous fluctuations in the initial state determine which of these two minima will be reached .    in summary , the equation , describing the growth dynamics of vortices in granular fluids , _ without _ the convective term is described by a time dependent landau - ginzburg equation for a non - conserved order parameter , @xmath146 , derived from an energy functional with a _ continuous _ set of degenerate minima , having the shape of a mexican hat .",
    "the last observation may suggest that unstable granular fluids have some resemblance to model h  @xcite which has a similar energy surface in the neighborhood of its stable fix points . however , this is not the case .",
    "addition of the nonlinear convective term to eq.([landau ] ) selects out of this infinite set of minima only subsets of admissible solutions . in two dimensions",
    "only _ two _ distinct minima survive . therefore ,",

    "it means that the density and temperature inhomogeneities show a period which is half the period of the shear flow profile .",

    "a fit to a sinusoidal curve supports the temperature and density profiles given by ( [ localtemperaturedensity ] ) .    as shown in eq.([localtemperaturedensity ] ) , the temperature and density inhomogeneities are in opposite phase , implying that dense regions are cold , and the dilute regions hot .",
    "the amplitudes are such that the overall pressure is constant , as we have assumed in the course of the paper .",
    "under the restrictions imposed in our derivations , as discussed in sec.3 , we have shown that the unstable dynamics and formation of vortex patterns in the flow field of a freely evolving fluid of inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) can be cast in the form of a time - dependent landau - ginzburg - type model for a non - conserved order parameter . in the two - dimensional case ( but not for @xmath234 ) the growth of the vortex pattern in the ihs fluid is qualitatively similar to spinodal decomposition for a non - conserved scalar order parameter , referred to as model a in the hohenberg ",

    "the analogy between unstable ihs fluid in two - dimensions and spinodal decomposition has already been pointed out in ref .",
    "a difference between our model and model a is that the energy functional ( [ landauf ] ) contains a quartic term with summations over two independent wave numbers .",
    "this implies a non - local interaction of the order parameter @xmath235 .",
    "the non - local interaction is caused by the scaled field @xmath236 . because the global temperature @xmath221 is determined by @xmath237 in all space ( see eq.([tbar ] ) ) ,",
    "the evolution of a local order parameter @xmath237 is affected by @xmath237 at any other points in space through @xmath221 .",
    "we have shown that nonlinear viscous heating gives rise to a quartic term in the energy functional , which is responsible for saturation of unstable vorticity modes .",
    "unstable vorticity modes initially grow as predicted by the linear stability analysis , but eventually saturate because of nonlinear viscous heating .",
    "the influence of nonlinear viscous heating on the formation of temperature inhomogeneities and clustering has been pointed out by goldhirsch and zanetti  @xcite , and investigated in more detail by brey et al .",
    "@xcite , by comparing the results of a hydrodynamic model with viscous heating , using direct monte carlo simulation of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the theoretical predictions of our zeroth order theory for the flow field and the decay of the energy are in quantitative agreement with md simulations of small systems as shown in sec.5 .",
    "they support the intuitive arguments used in deriving the zeroth order description , presented in sec.3 .",
    "moreover , the results presented here can be obtained as the lowest order approximation in a multi - time scale expansion  @xcite .",
    "this theory makes no assumption of incompressibility .",
    "there are some properties of those small systems that can not be described by the zeroth order theory .",
    "density and temperature _ inhomogeneities _ are only found in the next order of approximation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that results of our zeroth and first order approximations are consistent with the results of a nonlinear analysis by soto et al .",
    "@xcite of systems which are close to the stability thresholds @xmath238 .",
    "if the smallest wave number of the system @xmath239 is slightly smaller than @xmath238 , vorticity modes with the wave number @xmath239 grow so slowly that the rest of hydrodynamic modes are enslaved by these vorticity modes .",
    "besides , the amplitudes of these vorticity modes at long times are expected to saturate because of nonlinear effects and remain small . on the basis of this consideration , they obtained amplitude equations for the vorticity modes with @xmath239 .",
    "the inhomogeneous density and temperature are given as functions of the vorticity modes with @xmath239 .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the periodic boundary conditions , with which the simulations were carried out , obviously play a crucial role in the formation of a shear flow profile and of the density and temperature profiles , presented in ( [ us ] ) and ( [ localtemperaturedensity ] ) respectively . indeed , once the typical size of the vortex patterns becomes comparable to the length @xmath89 of the system for @xmath240 , the artificial periodic boundary conditions start to affect the evolution of the system . consequently",
    ", the long time regime @xmath241 described by the stationary solution is of less physical interest than the regime of unstable growth @xmath242 , where the typical size of the vortex patterns remains small compared to the length @xmath89 of the system .",
    "a thermodynamically large system is always in the unstable growth regime .",
    "unfortunately , the only analytic large time results for the unstable growth regime of granular fluids in _ thermodynamically large _ systems , have been obtained from fluctuating ( linear ) hydrodynamic equations or from mode coupling theory  @xcite , but not from truly nonlinear theories .",
    "an exception is a dilute gas of inelastic point particles in one dimension @xcite , where strong evidence supports the conjecture that the large space - time behavior is described by the adhesion model and the burgers equation .",
