    "the correlation between the x - ray flux and the spin - up rate confirms the presence of an accretion disk in the neutron star .",
    "qpo features correlated with flux / spin - up are further indication of an accretion disk .",
    "we analyzed the aperiodic variability in the x - ray flux of a0535 + 26 following the method described in @xcite . during the dec 2009 giant outburst we found that the power spectra of the hard  x ray flux of this source , between 3 mhz and 1 hz , consisted of an approximately 1/f power law continuum plus a broad qpo and a pulse component @xcite .",
    "on dec 10 the qpo was centered on 62@xmath41 mhz ( fwhm of 29@xmath42 mhz ) in the 25 - 50 kev band , and we were able to detect it from dec 4 to 27 .",
    "the qpo was strong in the 50100 kev band ( see fig .  [ qpo ] , left panel ) , but not detected in the 1225 kev range ( finger et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the aug 2009 normal outburst has a double peak structure , similar to that observed in the normal outburst right after the 2005 giant one ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for the 2005 normal outburst",
    ", we found that the pulse profiles in the first spike were different than in the main peak of the outburst , suggesting that a different physical mechanism operates in the two peaks .",
    "however , for the double - peaked normal outburst in aug 2009 , we did not find any difference in pulse shape between the two peaks .",
    "for the first time a low energy pulse profile of a0535 + 26 during a giant outburst has been obtained .",
    "[ qpo ] ( middle ) shows the pulse profile evolution with energy for an observation near the peak time of the outburst .",
    "we can see how the two main components of the profile evolve from a weak first peak plus a second strong component , to a strong first peak plus a severely diminished second one ( camero - arranz et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .      among other x - ray missions , gbm detected four normal outbursts in 2008 with higher flux outbursts beginning at an earlier orbital phase .",
    "after the dec 2009 giant outburst , a very large event was predicted based on new x - ray activity detected 19 days before periastron . our simultaneous optical observations ( fig .",
    "[ qpo ] , right ) showed how the circumstellar disk has grown to its full size before the dec 2009 giant outburst , waiting for the neutron star to arrive and begin accretion .",
    "they also revealed a strong h@xmath5 line in emission during and after the dec 2009 giant outburst , indicating that the donor star presented a disk around its equator before and after the large event , suggestive of a residual accretion disk present around the neutron star .",
    "later on , strong optical activity of hde245770 was observed on march 19 , 2010 by @xcite , an indicator of an incoming x - ray outburst of the system .",
    "this outburst peaked above @xmath0 1 crab ( another giant one ? ) .",
    "as we have seen , clues to the unpredictable x - ray behavior of a0535 + 26 are unveiled with observations of the strong optical / x - ray correlation observed .",
    "the overall picture is a system going through periods when the donor star has minimal circumstellar disc and then a dramatic disk recovery leads to a flare of x - ray emission .",
    "the be circumstelar disk was exceptionally large just before the dec 2009 giant outburst , most likely the origin of the unusual x - ray activity .",
    "in particular , this might explain the other large outburst occurring after the dec 2009 giant outburst .",
    "the double peak structure of the normal outbursts in 2005 and 2009 remains a mystery .",
    "we obtained the first pulse profile evolution during a giant outburst with gbm , showing the expected double peak structure evolving with the peak s strength shifting around the 25 - 50 kev band .",
    "another surprise was the lack of detection of the the x - ray qpo below 25 kev .",
    "work is ongoing to study the data from different x - ray missions to determine the timing and spectral properties of this source during the dec 2009 giant outburst and afterwards .",
    "preliminary results show no significant variation of the cyclotron line energy with the luminosity of the system ( caballero et al .",
