    "neutrino - nucleon neutral - current elastic ( nce ) scattering provides an additional information about of structure of the hadronic weak neutral current ( nc ) and plays an important role in searching for the three active neutrino @xmath11 conversion to a sterile neutrino @xmath12 : a neutrino which has no coupling to neither w@xmath13 nor z@xmath14 bosons .",
    "the weak neutral current of the nucleon may be parametrized in terms of two vector and one axial - vector form factors .",
    "an additional induced pseudoscalar form factor is presented , but its contribution vanishes in the limit of a zero neutrino mass . in particular , the axial - vector form factor may be split into a non - strange and strange contributions .",
    "the latter one is proportional to the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the strange quarks  @xcite .",
    "thus the axial - vector form factor is crucial for understanding the role that strange quarks play in determining the properties of nucleons .    in order to investigate how the strange quarks contribute to the observed properties of the nucleon various reactions",
    "have been proposed : deep inelastic scattering of neutrino or polarized charged leptons on proton  @xcite , and parity - violating electron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the strange vector form factors were measured in parity - violating electron scattering experiments  @xcite . a combined analysis of these experiments data points to small strangeness of the vector form factors  @xcite .",
    "whereas parity - violating electron scattering is sensitive to the electric and magnetic strangeness , neutrino - induced reactions are sensitive to the strange quark contribution @xmath7 to the nc axial - vector form factor .",
    "a measurement of @xmath15(@xmath16)- proton nce at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl e734 )  @xcite suggested a non - zero value of @xmath7 .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it has been shown that the bnl data can not provide a decisive conclusion about the value of @xmath7 when taking into account uncertainties in the vector strange form - factors . moreover , this result suffers strongly from experimental uncertainties due to difficulties in determination of the absolute neutrino flux .",
    "the measurement of the neutral - to - charged - current ( cc ) quasi - elastic cross section @xmath17 in neutrino - nucleus scattering was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to extract information on the strange spin of the proton because much of the systematic uncertainty is canceled by using the ratio .",
    "an important effort in this direction was the miniboone experiment , that measured the flux - averaged nce differential cross section @xmath18 as a function of four - momentum transferred squared @xmath19 and ratio @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the minerva experiment  @xcite aims at high precision measurements of neutrino scattering cross sections , and would be well - suited to examine the @xmath19 evaluation of strangeness form factor in nce scattering .    recently , the question about an additional sterile neutrino has drawn a considerable interest in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment , lsnd , at the los alamos national laboratory  @xcite reported evidence of @xmath20 oscillation , but with a squared mass difference @xmath21 that is inconsistent within a three neutrino mass model with the two other values extracted from solar , atmospheric , and reactor experiments , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "one of the most favorable scenarios that accommodates three independent @xmath23 values is an addition of a sterile neutrino . because three active neutrinos couple to z@xmath24 , the rate of neutrino nc events should be unaffected by the three flavor neutrino oscillation .",
    "conversely , an existence of a sterile neutrino adds a possibility of a @xmath25 transition that would create a deficit in the rate of nc events .    however , the sno experiment  @xcite made a neutral - current rate measurement and showed that the total flux of active neutrino from the sun agree with expectation from the standard solar model .",
    "the super - kamiokande experiment excludes @xmath26 and favors a pure @xmath27 oscillation in its analysis of atmospheric neutrinos where an admixture of the two possibilities is allowed  @xcite .",
    "the minos collaboration reported  @xcite the measurements of neutrino nc rates and spectra in an accelerator long baseline neutrino experiment .",
    "the rates at the near and far detectors are consistent with expectations from decay kinematics and geometry , providing new support for the interpretation of muon neutrino disappearance as oscillations among the three active neutrinos .",
    "so , an additional interest in the neutrino - nucleus nce scattering cross section is that this process plays a key role in a search for the parameter space available for @xmath25 oscillations .",
    "it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that in order to measure the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin using a neutrino - nucleon nce cross section it is necessary to distinguish @xmath28 from @xmath29 interactions.otherwise , the total nce cross - section on both proton and neutron ( @xmath30)has a negligible dependence on the nucleon spin s strangeness . a detailed analysis of the nce scattering cross section s sensitivity to the strange content of nucleon neutral current was carried out in a relativistic plane - wave impulse approximation in ref .",
    "analysis of nuclear structure effects on the determination of the strange quark contribution in neutrino - nucleus nce scattering were performed in refs.@xcite where the relativistic fermi gas model ( rfgm ) and relativistic shell model including final state interaction ( fsi ) of outgoing nucleon were used .",
    "the effects of fsi were also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite within the rfgm and in refs .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the random phase approximation theory .",
    "the effects of fsi on the ratio of proton - to - neutron cross section in nce scattering were discussed in refs.@xcite .",

    "@xcite within the framework of a relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) with a relativistic optical potential . in refs .",
    "@xcite important fsi effects arise from the use of optical potential within a relativistic green s function approach .",
    "an analys of the sensitivity of nce scattering cross section to the strangeness contribution was presented also in refs.@xcite within the rdwia and relativistic multiple - scattering glauber approximation .    in this paper",
    "we present the rdwia calculation of the neutrino - nucleon nce scattering cross section on carbon and @xmath0 . in this approach that was successfully applied in refs.@xcite to cc quasi - elastic scattering we calculated the flux - averaged @xmath18 cross section and ratio @xmath31 and compare the results with the miniboone data  @xcite . additionally , the ratio of the predicted event rates in the miniboone high energy @xmath32 and @xmath33 event samples was calculated .",

    "@xcite , we present a brief review that focuses on those modifications that arise from the weak neutral current .      in the laboratory frame , the differential cross section for the exclusive ( anti-)neutrino nce scattering , in which only a single discrete state or narrow resonance of the target is excited , can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the solid angle for the lepton momentum , @xmath46 is the solid angle for the ejectile nucleon momentum , @xmath47 is the recoil factor , @xmath48  mev@xmath49 is the fermi constant , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are nc lepton and nuclear tensors , respectively .",

    "note , that the weak lepton nc is conserved for massless neutrino and @xmath67 .",
    "all the nuclear structure information and fsi effects are contained in the weak nc nuclear tensor @xmath51 , which is given by the bilinear product of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear nc operator @xmath68 between the initial nucleus state @xmath69 and the final state @xmath70 as @xmath71 where the sum is taken over undetected states .",
    "this tensor is an extremely complicated object as , in principle , the exact form for many body wave functions and operators must be used .",
    "a general model - independent covariant form of @xmath72 and the result of its contraction with the leptonic tensor were obtained in ref .",

    "the independent particle shell model ( ipsm ) is assumed in the calculations of the nuclear structure , taking into account the short - range nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath105 ) correlation in the ground state . according to the experimental data  @xcite the occupancy of the ipsm orbitals of @xmath1c equals on average 89% .",
    "we assume that the missing strength ( 11% ) can be attributed to the @xmath105 correlations , leading to the appearance of the high - momentum and high - energy component in the nucleon distribution in the target . to estimate this effect in the inclusive cross sections , we consider a phenomenological model that incorporates both the single - particle nature of the nucleon spectrum at low energy ( ipsm orbitals ) and the high - energy and high - momentum components due to @xmath105 correlations .",

    "the relativistic optical potential consists of a real part which describes rescattering of the ejected nucleon and an imaginary part that accounts for its absorption into unobserved channels .",

    "this code , initially designed for computing exclusive electron - nucleus scattering , was successfully tested against a@xmath111 data  @xcite , and adopted for neutrino reactions  @xcite .",
    "a complex optical potential with a nonzero imaginary part generally produces an absorption of the flux . for the exclusive @xmath112 channel",
    "this reflects the coupling between different open reaction channels .",
    "however , for the inclusive reaction , the total flux must be conserved . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the inclusive ccqe neutrino cross section of the exclusive channel @xmath112 calculated with only the real part of the optical potential is almost identical when calculated via the green s function approach  @xcite , in which the fsi effects on inclusive reaction @xmath113 are treated by means of a complex potential , and the total flux is conserved .",

    "note , that precise measurement of the ( anti)neutrino nce scattering off neutron appear problematic due to the difficulties associated with neutron detection .                        in figs.[fig.1 ] ,  [ fig.2 ] , and [ fig.3 ] the ( anti)neutrino nce exclusive cross sections @xmath121 ( per bound proton ) , @xmath122 ( per bound neutron ) , and sum @xmath123 are displayed as functions of the emitted nucleon kinetic energy for proton , neutron , and proton or neutron knockout , respectively .",
