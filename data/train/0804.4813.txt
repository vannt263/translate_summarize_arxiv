    "inside the most powerful laser fields available today @xcite electrons and positrons can acquire kinetic energies in the gev range .",
    "next - generation laser devices are envisaged to generate even higher electromagnetic field intensities of @xmath2w/@xmath1 and above @xcite .",
    "the gev energy domain has also been demonstrated accessible via laser - wakefield acceleration of electrons @xcite and positrons @xcite . in principle , such high energies can be exploited to induce elementary particle reactions like heavy lepton - pair or hadron production in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "the energy scale associated with superintense laser fields is thus more typical for particle physics than for atomic and molecular physics , where laser fields are employed traditionally .",
    "apart from the high energies achievable , lasers can be utilized to generate well - controlled particle collisions at microscopically small impact parameters , which can lead to high luminosities @xcite .",
    "ions ( protons ) can also be accelerated by lasers @xcite , which may be used for triggering hadronic processes , such as pion production @xcite .",
    "consequently , intense laser fields offer alternative and supplementary ways towards high - energy physics @xcite .",
    "similar efforts to merge laser physics with nuclear physics are being undertaken successfully @xcite .",
    "laser - induced nuclear fusion @xcite , photofission @xcite , and neutron production @xcite have already been observed in experiment , whereas other processes like coherent nuclear excitation @xcite or muon - catalyzed fusion with laser assistance @xcite have been discussed on theoretical grounds .",
    "one of the most elementary processes in particle physics is the creation of a muon - antimuon pair from electron - positron annihilation , which has proven fundamental for the understanding of other @xmath3 reactions @xcite .",
    "the threshold particle energy in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) frame required for this reaction is determined by the muon rest mass @xmath4mev/@xmath5 and amounts to @xmath6 . in conventional accelerator facilities",
    "the collision energy is provided by quasistatic electric and guiding magnetic fields .    motivated by the sustained progress in laser technology",
    ", we have addressed the question whether the process @xmath7 is feasible with low - energy electrons and positrons in the presence of an intense laser field @xcite .",
    "the electrons and positrons are assumed to form initially a nonrelativistic @xmath3 plasma or a gas of positronium ( ps ) atoms @xcite .",
    "since the initial energy of the particles is far below @xmath8 , their annihilation into a muon pair can not happen without the influence of the external field .",
    "we stress , however , that the muon pair is not produced by the laser field itself , as it has been achieved before with regard to @xmath3 pair creation in the collision of a laser and an electron beam @xcite . in our case , this would require unrealistically strong laser fields of the order of the critical field @xmath9 for the muon , with the elementary charge @xmath10 and planck s constant @xmath11 , which corresponds to laser intensities @xmath12w/@xmath1 . instead , the muon pair is produced in an annihilating electron - positron collision , where the role of the laser field is to supply the required energy to the colliding particles .",
    "the case with initial ps atoms is particularly interesting since it allows for _ coherent _ @xmath3 collisions , which are characterized by microscopically small impact parameters @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electron and positron are initially confined to the atomic size of the bound ps state and then , after instantaneous ionization , are coherently accelerated by the strong laser field , which drives the particles into opposite directions along the laser electric - field component .",
    "this leads to periodic @xmath3 ( re)collisions whose energy is proportional to the laser intensity @xcite .",
    "note that the magnetic field - induced ponderomotive drift motion into the forward direction is identical for the electron and positron due to the equal magnitude of their charge - to - mass ratios . in this respect",
    "the ps system is distinguished from ordinary atoms where the heavy nucleus ( or ionic core ) stays behind , so that laser - driven collisions are suppressed at high field intensity @xcite . in the case of",
    "strongly laser - driven ps , the collisional impact parameter can be as small as the initial spatial separation of the particles which is determined by the ps bohr radius @xmath13 . this way , high particle current densities and collision luminosities are attainable @xcite .",
    "the combination of ps atoms with intense laser fields might therefore be considered as an `` @xmath3 micro - collider '' . the threshold laser intensity to render muon production with significant probability from ps or a low - energy @xmath3 plasma",
    "is determined by the relation @xmath14 , with the laser vector potential @xmath15 , because the collision energy comes from the transversal motion . for a near - infrared laser wavelength of @xmath16 @xmath17 m ,",
    "the threshold intensity amounts to @xmath18w/@xmath1 , which is almost reached by the most powerful present laser systems @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath7 in a laser field has also been discussed within a two - step mechanism recently : in ref .",
    "@xcite , an @xmath3 pair is assumed to be created in the collision of a laser pulse with a relativistic ion beam , and the muons are subsequently produced in a laser - driven @xmath3 collision .",
    "the laser field strength in the ionic rest frame needs to approach the schwinger value @xmath19v / cm ( @xmath20w/@xmath1 ) . in this way",
    ", the well - established analogy between atomic ionization and @xmath3 pair creation in strong laser fields has been extended to include also the recollision step . in a broader sense",
    ", the investigation of lepton - lepton interactions in laser fields has a long history , comprising laser - assisted @xmath21 ( mller ) @xcite , @xmath3 ( bhabha ) @xcite , and @xmath22 scattering @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the process under consideration here , these lepton - lepton scattering processes can also take place without a background laser field , and the presence of the latter merely modifies the field - free cross - section .    in the present paper , we give a comprehensive account of the reaction @xmath23 in a laser wave of linear polarization , this way extending our recent study in ref.@xcite .",
    "the ps atom is supposed to be initially at rest and in its ground state .",
    "the @xmath24 pair is created in the laser - driven @xmath3 collisions as described above ( see also fig.1 ) . on the one hand ,",
    "we perform a quantum electrodynamical calculation to obtain the total production rate and muon spectra ; both analytical and numerical results are presented .",
    "the occurence of sums of generalized bessel functions of very high order @xmath25 constitutes a major difficulty of the case of a linearly polarized driving field . on the other hand ,",
    "particular emphasis is laid upon the derivation of a semi - classical model for the muon production process , representing one of the main extensions of @xcite .",
    "the model allows to interpret the typical muon momenta and the total process probability in a simple and intuitive manner .",
    "it is proven by a saddle - point consideration and resembles the famous three - step model of laser - driven recollisions @xcite , but also exhibits characteristic differences .",
    "the saddle - point treatment moreover provides us with a suitable asymptotic expansion to handle the high - order generalized bessel functions .",
    "furthermore , a comparison is drawn with muon pair creation from ps in a laser field of circular polarization , which was treated in ref .",
    "in this situation it was found that the muon production is essentially suppressed , because the @xmath3 rescattering occurs at large impact parameters .",
    "the latter are determined mainly by the classical electron and positron trajectories in the circularly polarized field and have the macroscopic dimension @xmath26 cm , where @xmath27 is the laser intensity parameter [ see eq.([xi ] ) below ] . instead , in a linearly polarized field the collisional impact parameter can be microscopically small , @xmath28 cm , which enhances the probability for ps decay into a muon pair by several orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , the experimental feasibilty of laser - induced muon production is discussed in detail . it is shown that an observation of the process will be rendered possible in a crossed - beam setup employing high - power laser sources of the next generation combined with high - density ps samples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we derive general expressions for the probability of laser - driven ps decay into muons in two ways .",
    "first , we proceed in sec.ii.a along the lines of our earlier paper @xcite and evaluate the process amplitude by virtue of a fourier expansion , where the fourier coefficients are given by generalized bessel functions .",
    "in sec.ii.b we employ an alternative approach based on the saddle - point integration method , which will prove useful in various respects : we show that important features of the considered muon production process can be understood in classical terms ( see also sec.iii.b ) and derive an asymptotic expansion of the generalized bessel function [ see eq.([genbesasy ] ) ] , which later serves us in our numerical computations .",
    "these special functions frequently occur in calculations of intense laser - matter interactions @xcite .",
    "based on the general expressions at hand , the relevant physical features of the process are elaborated in sec.iii .",
    "the kinematics of the produced muons is analyzed in sec.iii.a and explained in sec.iii.b within an intuitive semi - classical model .",
    "in sec.iii.c we derive a closed analytical approximation to the total creation rate [ see eq.([rps2 ] ) ] , which exhibits the main physical features of the process and can be interpreted in terms of the cross section for the field - free reaction @xmath7 and the quantum mechanical dispersion of the initially bound @xmath3 wave packet in the laser field .",
    "afterwards , we briefly consider in sec.iii.d the related process of muon pair production by a superstrong laser wave of linear polarization which interacts with a nonrelativistic @xmath3 plasma .",
    "the influence of the laser polarization is revealed in sec.iii.e . in the following sec.iv we present results of numerical calculations , compare them with previous ones for circular laser polarization , and discuss their relevance for an experimental investigation of laser - driven muon creation . here ,",
    "also more complex driving field configurations and their potential advantages are described .",
    "we summarize our main results and conclusions in sec.v .",
    "relativistic units with @xmath29 are used throughout , except where otherwise stated .",
    "the finestructure constant is @xmath30 .",
    "we employ the metric tensor @xmath31 , so that the scalar product of two four - vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 reads @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , feynman slash notation @xmath35 is used , with the dirac matrices @xmath36 .",
    "the rate for positronium decay into muons in a strong laser field can be calculated within the framework of laser - dressed quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the driving laser field is assumed to be a monochromatic plane wave of linear polarization , described by the classical four - potential @xmath37 with the polarization four - vector @xmath38 , the wave four - vector @xmath39 , and the amplitude @xmath40 . in the following consideration ,",
    "the laser parameters have typical values of @xmath41 and @xmath42mv , corresponding to a high intensity @xmath43 w/@xmath1 in the near - infrared frequency domain .",
    "when an electron and a positron are exposed to such an intense laser wave , the interparticle coulomb interaction is much weaker than the coupling to the external field and may be neglected . within the spirit of the strong - field approximation @xcite , the amplitude of the process @xmath44 can therefore be expressed as a superposition integral @xcite @xmath45 with a normalization volume @xmath46 and the fourier transform @xmath47 of the ps ground state of bohr radius @xmath48 .",

    "analogous expressions hold for the volkov states @xmath65 , the free momenta @xmath66 , the spin states @xmath67 , the effective momenta @xmath68 , and the effective mass @xmath69 of the muons .",
    "moreover , we apply in eq.([see ] ) the free photon propagator @xmath70    we comment on various approximations that are implicitly contained in the above equations .",
    "( 1 ) the initial spin coupling in the ps ground - state is neglected in eq.([sps ] ) .",
    "it is of minor importance in the presence of the strong laser wave ; the corresponding hyperfine splitting between the ortho- and para - states amounts to less than 1mev which is negligibly small on the energy scale set by the external field .",
    "moreover , later on we will average over the @xmath71 spin states [ see eq.([rps ] ) ] so that our approach applies to a statistical ensemble of ps atoms .",
    "a spin state - resolved calculation could be performed by inserting appropriate projection operators @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the amplitude in eq.([see ] ) fully accounts for the interaction of the leptons with the laser field , while their interaction with the qed vacuum is taken into account to lowest order , in accordance with the feynman graph in fig.1 .",
    "the interplay between the coulomb field and the electromagnetic wave during the very beginning of the laser field s rising edge might lead to small distortions in the momentum distribution @xmath72 .",
    "( 3 ) our treatment moreover neglects the radiative energy loss of the laser - driven electron and positron due to thomson scattering , which is rather small for the laser parameters under consideration @xcite .

    "iii.c that the coherent rate is reduced by quantum mechanical wave - packet spreading of the initially well - localized electron - positron state .",

    "the latter is determined by the laser focal spot size .",

    ", the incoherent rate gives the same order of magnitude as the coherent rate in eq.([rps3 ] ) .    to conclude this section we note that the coherent channel of muon production from ps atoms evolves into the incoherent channel in the limit of large wave packet size ( @xmath282 ) . on the one hand , with increasing wave packet size the coherent rate is more and more suppressed ; on the other hand , electrons ( positrons ) stemming from different ps atoms start to overlap and the gas of ps atoms transforms into an @xmath3 plasma .",
    "therefore , in the limit of large wave - packet size , the incoherent reaction rate ( [ rfree ] ) will eventually dominate the muon production process .      in a previous paper",
    ", we have treated the process @xmath44 in a laser field of circular polarization @xcite .",
    "the threshold intensity in this case is larger by a factor of two , since the same minimum peak field strength is needed . from the investigation of laser - driven recollision processes in atoms or molecules ( e.g. , high - harmonic generation ) it is known that the efficiency of these processes is strongly suppressed in a circularly polarized laser field @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the ionized electron is forced onto a circular trajectory and does not return to the parent ion , which stays at rest due to its heavy mass . in our case ,",
    "the situation is different as both binding partners move along circular orbits ( within the polarization plane ) under the influence of a circularly polarized field . but still , we also find a strong reduction of the reaction @xmath44 when the laser polarization is circular .",
    "the corresponding rate approximately amounts to @xmath283 with @xmath284 . here , the volkov state normalization of eq.([vol ] ) and the approximate treatment of the @xmath63-function in eq.([tilderps1 ] ) has been applied .",
    "we emphasize that this leads to a correction factor of @xmath285 as compared to eq.(52 ) in @xcite , resulting in an even smaller production probability than predicted there .",
    "the physical conclusions of this paper thus remain unchanged .",
    "in particular , the rate suppression in a circularly polarized field is mainly expressed by the damping factor @xmath286 ^ 4\\sim 10^{-25}$ ] in eq.([rpscirc ] ) .",
    "this factor can be attributed to the classical motion of the electron and positron , which corotate on opposite sides of a circle of radius @xmath287 in the polarization plane .",
    "the interparticle distance is thus larger than their wave - packet extensions .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of a linearly polarized field , where the classical trajectories periodically meet and the rate damping results from quantum mechanical dispersion ( cf .",
    "equation  ( [ rpscirc ] ) can also be written in the form @xmath288 which is more similar to eq.([rps2 ] ) and allows an interpretation along the lines of eqs.([sigma])-([rps3 ] ) . according to the above , the electron - positron distance in the c.m .",
    "frame amounts to @xmath289 [ cp . eq.([spreading ] ) ] . hence , as before in eq.([rps3 ] ) , the total reaction rate can be expressed as @xmath290 , where we have dropped factors which are of order unity at @xmath291 .",
    "the incoherent rate of muon production from a nonrelativistic @xmath3 plasma driven by a circularly polarized laser field reads @xmath292 the formula involves an additional factor of @xmath293 in comparison with eq.(59 ) in @xcite , as well . since quantum wave - packet spreading and classical motion are not crucial here , the incoherent rate is of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding one in a laser field of linear polarization [ cf .",
    "eq.([rfree ] ) ] .",
    "the incoherent muon yield in a circularly polarized field is slightly larger , which can be attributed to the fact that the field amplitude is constant and not oscillating , as it is for a lineraly polarized wave .",
    "similar results are known from other strong - field phenomena such as @xmath3 pair creation in combined laser and coulomb fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the basis of eq.([rps ] ) we have also performed numerical calculations of the laser - driven process @xmath44 .",
    "the high - order generalized bessel functions were evaluated with the asymptotic expansion ( [ genbesasy ] ) .",

    "the agreement between the numerical simulation and the approximate expression is reasonably good .",
    "the reaction rates in the case of circular polarization are about eight orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of linear polarization .",
    "the very pronounced impact of the laser polarization on the process efficiency was discussed in sec .",
    "iii.e .    in",
    "a linearly polarized driving field , the muon production rate starts from zero at the energetic threshold [ see eq.([rps2 ] ) ] and reaches maximum values of the order of 10@xmath294 s@xmath295 at laser intensities of about @xmath296 w/@xmath1 ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "the overall behaviour of the rate is similar to that of the cross section for the field - free process @xmath7 in eq.([sigma ] ) . at higher intensities",
    ", however , the rate decreases more strongly than the cross section , since the decrease results not only from the typical high - energy dependence @xmath298 but also from the enhanced wave - packet spreading [ cf .",
    "eq.([rps3 ] ) ] .",
    "for comparison we note that the rate for muon creation in a hypothetical large - scale @xmath3 collider experiment , that employs a single electron and a single positron only , would be of the order of @xmath299s@xmath295 @xcite .",

    "partial production rates with respect to the number @xmath179 of absorbed laser photons are shown ( i.e. , the contributions to the total rate stemming from a net absorption of @xmath179 laser photons in the production process ) .",
    "the photon number is given in units of @xmath301 . since @xmath302",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ typicalp ] ) ] , the partial rates reflect the energy distribution of the created muons .",
    "the distribution is broad , indicating a substantial width of the energy which is available in the process and transformed into muons .",

    "energy associated with the @xmath3 annihilation is @xmath304^{1/2}\\sim 200\\,$]mev .",
    "it depends on the initial momentum @xmath305 via the effective particle momenta @xmath64 [ see eq.([q ] ) ] .",
    "the initial momentum spread @xmath306 translates into a longitudinal width @xmath307 , whereas the transversal momentum components add up to zero .",
    "since @xmath306 is small , the number @xmath85 of photons absorbed at the electron - positron vertex of the feynman graph varies within narrow bounds [ see eq.([qsq ] ) ] . as a result ,",
    "the width of the collision energy @xmath308kev is small .",
    "the main limitation for a well - defined effective collision energy comes from the fact that the total number @xmath179 of absorbed laser photons is not fixed , but has a large width @xmath309 ( see fig .",
    "this is because the number of photons absorbed at the muon - antimuon vertex varies within a wide range .",

    "the range of contributing photon numbers quickly increases and attains a typical size of @xmath317 for the parameters considered in fig .",
    "3 . this leads to a corresponding spread @xmath318gev of the muon energies in the laboratory frame ( or @xmath319mev in the c.m .",

    "the partial reaction rate for @xmath331 is always zero .",
    "furthermore , the curves exhibit maxima at @xmath332 , in agreement with eq.([barr ] ) ; the typical photon number @xmath333 is increasing with the applied laser intensity .",
    "we point out that the width of the curves is significantly larger than in the case of circular laser polarization ( see fig.3 and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this can be understood by observing that , in a linearly polarized field , @xmath3 collisions not only occur at the optimum laser phase ( which is predicted by the simple man s model and gives rise to the absorption of @xmath333 photons ) , but also at earlier or later phases . hence the collision",
    "energy varies , which broadens the energy distribution of the created particles .",
    "different from that , in the circular polarization case all creation phases are equivalent , so that the width of the partial production rate is purely of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "the maximum coherent rate resulting from a single laser - driven ps atom is of the order of @xmath334s@xmath295 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the total process probability is obtained by multiplying the rate with the interaction time , which is given by the laser pulse duration .",
    "the high intensities required to ignite the process ( @xmath335@xmath336 w/@xmath1 ) are attained in short laser pulses , with typical durations in the ps  fs domain .",
    "the muon yield per laser pulse from a single ps atom is therefore very small ( @xmath337 ) .    since the total probability of the coherent process increases linearly with the number of ps atoms involved , high ps densities are desirable . in recent years",

    "the muon creation then proceeds via the incoherent channel .",
    "incoherent muon production from a laser - driven @xmath3 plasma requires high target densities , as well , because of the small focal spot size of strong laser pulses , which determines the interaction volume . by assuming again a typical focal volume of @xmath344@xmath341 , which contains @xmath345 particles at a plasma density of @xmath346@xmath339 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a total incoherent rate of @xmath347s@xmath295 at @xmath348 [ see eq.([rfree ] ) ] . in view of the short duration of strong laser pulses and the above values of @xmath258 and @xmath264 ,",
    "both the coherent and incoherent channels of laser - driven muon pair production seem to be hardly observable in experiment at first sight .",

    ", there is practically no motion along the magnetic - field direction , apart from wave packet spreading ( @xmath358 ) . in order not to waste laser power",
    ", it would therefore be useful to employ laser foci of elliptical shape : prolonged along the polarization axis and compressed in perpendicular direction .",

    "the peculiar muon kinematics is explicable in terms of a semi - classical simple man s model .",
    "it essentially arises from the fact , that the electron and positron are forced by the laser field to longitudinal velocities close to the speed of light , i.e. , the c.m .",
    "frame is moving at high velocity with respect to the laboratory frame .",
    "the energy distribution of the muons is broad , because the number of photons absorbed from the laser field during the production process varies over a wide range .    as to the total reaction rates",
    ", we found that a high scattering luminosity is achieved in the case with initial ps atoms .",
    "this is due to coherent @xmath3 collisions at small impact parameters , which result from the microscopic extension of the initial state and the symmetric electron - positron dynamics in the laser field .",
    "limitations on the process efficiency are set by quantum mechanical wave - packet spreading which dilutes the particle density at the collision .",
    "the resulting coherent reaction rate from a dense ps sample is about 10@xmath363s@xmath295 for a laser of intensity @xmath364 w/@xmath1 and focal volume @xmath365 .",
    "this value is several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding reaction rate in a circularly polarized field , where the process is suppressed by the classical electron and positron trajectories .",
    "the incoherent rate for muon production from a laser - driven @xmath3 plasma is essentially insensitive to the field polarization and reaches values of @xmath366s@xmath295 at high plasma densities .",
    "the field - induced process @xmath44 is experimentally accessible in a setup that employs a high - density ps target ( @xmath367@xmath339 ) and counterpropagating laser beams to control the wave - packet spreading .",
    "the coherent production rate could be increased to @xmath368s@xmath295 this way , which translates into an effective muon yield of about @xmath369s@xmath295 when the laser pulse duration ( @xmath370fs ) and repetition frequency ( @xmath371hz - khz ) are taken into account .",
    "the event rate achievable with the laser - driven `` @xmath3 micro - collider '' in the crossed - beams configuration is similar to those at large - scale accelerator facilities .",
    "an experimental observation of laser - induced muon pair creation from ps decay , though challenging , will therefore be rendered feasible by the next - generation of high - power laser devices .      in the derivation of eq.([ssq ] ) in sec.ii.a , we neglected weak dependences on the bound - state momentum @xmath49 in the transition amplitude when performing the integral over the ps momentum distribution . as regards kinematic terms appearing as linear factors , this approximation is certainly justified .",
    "but we also ignored the @xmath49 dependence in the argument of the @xmath63 function in eq.([ssq ] ) , which is a more subtle simplification . in this appendix",
    "we show that this approximation is indeed justified",
    ".    with the @xmath63 function included , the integral in eq.([barjr ] ) reads @xmath372 according to eq.([q ] ) , the effective momenta are weakly dependent on @xmath49 ( see also sec.iv.b ) .",
    "we perform a taylor expansion up to leading order @xmath373 where @xmath374 denote the values of @xmath375 at @xmath376 and @xmath377 within the momentum range given by @xmath72 , the correction term can be as large as @xmath378 . since it is multiplied by the wave four - vector in eq.([tildejr ] ) , we can consider @xmath379 as a correction to the photon number @xmath179 . recall that a typical value is @xmath380 so that @xmath381 . hence , by the bessel function properties",
    ", the correction to the photon number induced by the term ( [ deltaq ] ) could , in general , be important .    by writing the square of the amplitude as a product of two terms",
    ", we can express the reaction rate as @xmath382 where linear kinematic factors were suppressed in the notation .",
    "both @xmath63 functions in eq.([rsim ] ) contain the term @xmath383 .",
    "one of these we exploit to integrate by @xmath384 , and the integral over @xmath385 is performed with the help of @xmath386 .",
    "the latter @xmath63 function fixes the value of @xmath385 to @xmath387 another two of the remaining @xmath63 functions coincide and we obtain ( with the interaction length @xmath388 )      where in the last step we made use of the fact that @xmath390 and thus @xmath391 can also be expressed in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath179 , since @xmath392 . by performing a taylor expansion @xmath393",
    "we observe that the leading @xmath49 dependence drops out of the argument of the @xmath63 function .",
    "hence , we arrive at the desired result @xmath394 which shows that the argument of the @xmath63 function in eq.([ssq ] ) may be taken at @xmath376 .      in this appendix",
    "we calculate the integral in eq.([int ] ) : @xmath395 where @xmath396 according to eq.([arguv ] ) . in the taylor expansions on the right - hand side of these equations we kept those terms which are of importance according to the properties of the function @xmath397 . by virtue of eq.([genbes ] ) we can expand eq.([jr ] ) into series @xmath398 with @xmath399 from the kinematical analysis in sec.iii.a we know that @xmath400 . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnitude of the argument @xmath401 is much smaller than the order @xmath179 of the generalized bessel function .",
    "this is corroborated by our numerical calculations , according to which @xmath402 is smaller than @xmath179 by an order of magnitude in the integration region of interest . in order to obtain significant values of @xmath403",

    "therefore , we can perform the @xmath411 integration in eq.([jrs ] ) approximately and obtain @xmath412 where @xmath413 is the @xmath411 value corresponding to @xmath414 by eq.([arg2 ] ) , and @xmath72 may be taken at @xmath415 since @xmath416 . by introducing the variables @xmath417 and @xmath418 , eq.([jrsx ] ) becomes @xmath419 with @xmath420 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{\\delta v-\\zeta}^{\\delta v+\\zeta }   { j_s(x)dx\\over\\sqrt{\\zeta^2-(x-\\delta v)^2}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the substitution @xmath421 $ ] was made in the second step and the definitions @xmath422 , @xmath105 were employed . in eq.([isigma ] ) the width of the function @xmath423 is determined by @xmath424 , whereas the width of the square root in the denominator is given by @xmath425 . in order to evaluate the integral @xmath426 , we accordingly divide the integration range into regions and show @xmath427 in the first range ( @xmath428 ) , we have @xmath429 and thus obtain @xmath430 the second range ( @xmath431 ) similarly yields @xmath432 in the third range we employ the asymptotic expansion @xcite @xmath433 and find @xmath434 where @xmath435 denotes the gamma function .",
    "this shows eq.([isigma2 ] ) .",

    "note that we have not restricted the range of integration according to @xmath444 here , since @xmath445 . for calculating the third region",
    ", we do restrict the integration to satisfy @xmath446 as follows : @xmath447 where in the last step @xmath448 was applied .        in this appendix",
