    "electrical breakdown of disordered media has been widely studied in the last twenty years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is due to its relevant implications on material technology and on fundamental aspects related to the understanding of the response properties of disordered systems to high external stresses @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the application of a finite stress ( electrical or mechanical ) to a disordered material generally implies a nonlinear response , which leads to a catastrophic behavior in the high stress limit @xcite .",
    "percolation theory provides a powerful approach for studying breakdown phenomena of disordered media @xcite . in this framework",
    ", several models have been proposed to describe the electrical breakdown of granular metals and of conductor - insulator composites in terms of critical phenomena near the percolation threshold @xcite-@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the critical exponents characterizing these behaviors have been both theoretically calculated and measured in severals materials @xcite,@xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , few attempts have been made so far to describe the behavior of disordered media over the full range of applied stress @xcite .",
    "the understanding of breakdown phenomena in the full dynamical regime is thus unsatisfactory to the present time . on the other hand ,",
    "important information is expected from such a study , like precursor effects , rle of disorder , predictability of breakdown , etc . @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a percolative model of sufficient generality to address the above issues . to this purpose",
    ", we consider a random resistor network ( rrn ) @xcite in which two competing percolations are present , defect generation and defect recovery , which determine the values of the elementary network resistances .",
    "both processes are driven by an external current and by the heat exchange between the network and the thermal bath .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed to explore the network evolution in a wide range of bias values .",
    "a stationary state or an irreversible breakdown of the rrn can be reached depending on the value of the applied current . by focusing on the steady state , we study the resistance and the resistance noise properties .",
    "we found that the average network resistance and the relative resistance noise scale with the ratio of the applied current to the current value corresponding to the onset of nonlinearity .",
    "these results are discussed in connection with measurements in composite materials and in conducting polymers @xcite .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional , square - lattice rrn of total resistance @xmath6 , made of @xmath7 resistors with resistance @xmath8 .",
    "we take a square geometry @xmath9 , where @xmath10 determines the linear size of the network .",
    "a constant current @xmath0 is applied through electrical contacts realized by perfectly conducting bars at the left and right sides of the network . as a consequence ,",
    "a current @xmath11 is flowing in the n_th _ resistor .",
    "the rrn interacts with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath12 and the resistances @xmath8 are taken to depend linearly on the local temperature @xmath13 , according to : @xmath14      \\label{eq : tcr}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the resistance value of the elementary resistor at the temperature @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the temperature coefficient of the resistance .",
    "the local temperatures are calculated as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{eq : temp}\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath19 is the number of first neighbours of the n_th _ resistor , the parameter @xmath20 , measured in ( k / w ) , describes the heat coupling of each resistor with the thermal bath and it determines the importance of joule heating effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is taken to be equal to @xmath22 to provide a uniform heating in the perfect network configuration .",
    "we notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) implies an instantaneous thermalization of each resistor at the value @xmath13 , and then , by adopting eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) , we are neglecting for simplicity time dependent effects which are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the initial state of the network ,",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and all the resistors are identical @xmath25 .",
    "the evolution of the rrn arises from the presence of two competing percolations .",
    "the first consists of generating fully insulating defects ( broken resistors ) .",
    "this process occurs with probability : @xmath26       \\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a characteristic activation energy and @xmath28 the boltzmann constant @xcite .",
    "the second percolation consists of recovering the insulating defects .",
    "this process occurs with a probability @xmath29 expressed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) but with a different activation energy @xmath30 .",
    "as a result of the competition between these two percolations , depending on the parameters which specify the physical properties of the system and depending on the external conditions ( bias current and bath temperature ) , the rrn can reach a steady state or the percolation threshold . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath6 fluctuates around its average value @xmath3 , while in the second case , an irreversible breakdown occurs , i.e. @xmath6 diverges due to the existence of at least one continuous path of defects between the upper and lower sides of the network @xcite . by focusing on the effect of the external current , we define @xmath31 as the greatest current value for which the rnn is stationary .",
    "we notice that for biased percolation the following expression , @xmath32 $ ] , represents a necessary condition for the existence of a steady state @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed according to the following procedure : ( i ) starting from the perfect lattice with given local currents and temperatures , @xmath11 and @xmath13 , ( ii ) resistances @xmath33 are changed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcr ] ) and defects are generated with probability @xmath34 ; ( iii ) the currents @xmath11 are calculated by solving kirchhoff s loop equations ; the local temperatures are updated ; ( iv ) the temperature dependence of the resistances @xmath33 is again accounted for and defects are recovered with probability @xmath29 ; ( v ) @xmath6 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 are finally calculated and this procedure is iterated from ( ii ) until electrical breakdown or steady state is achieved . in the last case the iteration runs long enough to allow a fluctuation analysis to be performed .",
    "each iteration step can be associated with an elementary time step on an appropriate time scale ( to be calibrated with experiments ) . as reasonable values of the parameters ,",
    "simulations have been performed by taking : @xmath35 ( except when differently specified ) , @xmath36 ( k ) , @xmath37 ( k@xmath38 ) , @xmath39 ( k / w ) , @xmath40 ( ev ) .",
    "several values of @xmath30 and @xmath41 have been considered : @xmath42 ( ev ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . the values of the external current range between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( a ) .",
    "we show in fig . 1 a picture of the rrn near the electrical breakdown . in this case",
    "we have taken : @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath49 ( ev ) and @xmath50 ( a ) , i.e. @xmath51 ( a ) .",
    "the different levels of gray correspond to different values of @xmath33 .",
    "we can clearly see that , with respect to the initial state ( perfect network ) , the network has evolved to a disordered state associated with the formation and growth of a channel of broken resistors elongated in the direction perpendicular to the applied current .",
    "this kind of damage pattern well reproduces the experimental pattern observed in metallic lines failed as a consequence of electromigration @xcite .",
    "typical evolutions of @xmath6 are shown in fig . 2 at increasing bias values .",
    "in this case @xmath52 while all the other parameters are the same of fig .",
    "thinner curves refer to steady state regime while the thicker curve refers to a rrn undergoing electrical breakdown ( @xmath53 ) . in the steady state",
    "two regimes can be identified : an ohmic regime ( lower two curves ) and a nonlinear regime characterized by a significant increase of resistance ( remaining curves ) . by focusing on the steady state regime",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "3 the average resistance @xmath3 as a function of the applied current .",
    "the different curves correspond to different values of @xmath41 , i.e. to rrns of different initial resistance , while the recovery activation energy is @xmath54 ( ev ) .",
    "each value have been calculated by considering the time average on a single realization and then making the ensemble average over 20 realizations . at low biases",
    "the average resistance takes a constant value @xmath4 which represents the intrinsic linear response property of the network ( ohmic regime ) .",
    "when @xmath0 is above a threshold value @xmath5 ( threshold for the nonlinearity onset ) , @xmath3 increases with bias until the applied current reaches the @xmath31 value , above which the rrn undergoes electrical breakdown .",
    "thus , in the following , we indicate with @xmath55 the average value of @xmath6 at @xmath56 , i.e. the last stable value of the resistance .",
    "figure 3 also shows that by increasing @xmath41 and thus the initial network resistance , both @xmath5 and @xmath31 decrease .",
    "precisely , we have found : @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 . therefore the ratio @xmath60 is independent of the initial network resistance .",
    "moreover , we have also found @xmath61 .",
    "the effect of the recovery activation energy on the steady state is shown in fig .",
    "4 , which reports the ratio @xmath1 as a function of the applied current for different values of @xmath30 ( in this case all the curves are obtained for @xmath48 ( @xmath44 ) ) .",
    "the overall behavior is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "3 : an ohmic regime at low bias is followed by a nonlinear regime for @xmath62 . moreover , by increasing @xmath30 both @xmath5 and @xmath31 decrease and the stability region is thus strongly reduced . nevertheless , an important difference between the effect of varying the initial network resistance and that of varying @xmath30 is that , in the last case , the ratio @xmath63 , exhibits a significant dependence on @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . to investigate the existence of scaling relations and their universality , fig .",
    "6 reports the log - log plot of the relative variation of the average resistance , @xmath64 , as a function of the ratio @xmath2 for different values of @xmath41 and @xmath30 .",
    "the plot shows that all these curves collapse onto a single one and that the relative variation of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath2 exhibits a power law behavior .",
    "we conclude that , the average resistance follows the scaling relation : @xmath65 with the scaling exponent @xmath66 being independent of both the initial resistance of the rrn and the recovery activation energy .",
    "other simulations , performed on rectangular networks , confirm the same value for @xmath67 .",
    "the quadratic dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath0 , found here , can be understood in the spirit of mean - field theory when we consider that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , recalling previous results concerning the ratio @xmath70 , eq.([eq : scal ] ) explains the independence of the ratio @xmath71 on the initial rrn resistance ( fig .",
    "3 ) and , by contrast , its significant dependence on @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "all these results well agree with recent measurements in the joule regime of carbon high - density polyethylene composites reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resistance fluctuations are analyzed for different values of @xmath72 and @xmath15 .",
    "figure 7 reports the relative variance of resistance fluctuations , @xmath73 , as a function of the external current .",
    "curves 1 , 2 and 3 ( with full circles ) show @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( ev ) respectively , while the curves belonging to the set 3 are obtained for @xmath79 ( ev ) and different values of @xmath15 .",
    "figure 7 points out the existence of two different noise regimes .",
    "the first regime occurs for @xmath80 , i.e. when joule heating effects are negligible .",
    "this noise arises from two random percolations and represents an intrinsic noise of the rrn , depending only on the values of @xmath27 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the second regime occurs when @xmath62 and the value of @xmath74 is found to become strongly dependent on the external current . by plotting @xmath81 as a function of @xmath70",
    "we have found that all the data of fig .",
    "7 collapse onto a single curve , as shown in fig .",
    "moreover , a power law behavior is observed in the pre - breakdown region .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the relative variance of resistance fluctuations follows the scaling relation : @xmath82 where the scaling exponent is @xmath83 .",
    "this value of @xmath84 agrees with the values obtained from electrical noise measurements in conducting polymers @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied by monte carlo simulations the stationary regime of rrns resulting from the simultaneous evolutions of two competing percolations .",
    "the two percolations consist of generating ( recovering ) fully insulating defects which are driven by an external current and by the heat exchange with a thermal bath .",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of the average resistance and of the relative variance of resistance fluctuations over a wide range of the applied current and as a function of different model parameters .",
    "we have found that both these quantities follow a scaling relation in terms of the ratio between the applied current and the current value corresponding to the nonlinearity onset .",
    "both scaling exponents are found to be independent of the model parameters .",
    "these results compare well with resistance measurements in composite materials performed in the joule regime up to breakdown @xcite and with noise measurements in conducting polymers @xcite .",
    "2 - resistance as a function of time at increasing bias values .",
    "thinner curves correspond to steady state regime and they are obtained , going from bottom to top , for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( a ) . the thicker curve is obtained for @xmath91 ( a ) and it corresponds to a rrn undergoing electrical breakdown .",
    "7 - relative variance of resistance fluctuations as a function of the external bias .",
    "curves 1 , 2 , 3 refer to @xmath99 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath100 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ev , respectively .",
    "the five curves belonging to set 3 are obtained with @xmath99 ( @xmath44 ) ( full circles ) , @xmath101 ( @xmath44 ) ( open squares ) , @xmath102 ( @xmath44 ) ( full triangles ) , @xmath103 ( @xmath44 ) ( open triangles ) , @xmath104 ( @xmath44 ) ( full diamonds ) .    fig .",
