    "the idea of physical systems characterised by two different temperatures has been proposed a long time ago for the models of spin - glasses and neural networks with partially annealed disorder @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the two temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to two different degrees of freedom , which are evolving at two essentially different time scales . as an example",
    ", one may consider a system in which the fast spin variables are connected with the thermal bath kept at the temperature @xmath3 , while the slow spin - spin coupling parameters are connected with another thermal bath maintained at the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it can be easily shown that in the stationary ( non - equilibrium ) state the statistical properties of such systems are described by the usual replica theory of disordered systems with a _",
    "finite _ value of the replica parameter @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , generalisation of this idea to the case when dynamics of two types of degrees of freedom is characterised by two comparable ( or equal ) time scales turned out to be rather problematic : it seems that there is no generic explicit expression for the stationary probability distribution function which would generalise the gibbs distribution of the equilibrium case @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , there is a particular case for which one can find an explicit and a rather non - trivial expression for the stationary distribution function .",
    "namely , this is the case when the two degrees of freedom @xmath7 and @xmath8 related to the thermal baths with the temperatures @xmath9 respectively , experience a potential which is a _",
    "quadratic _ function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . during last decade theoretical investigations of such type of systems were mostly concentrated on the studies of nonequilibrium fluctuations and energy transfer @xcite . recently",
    "this type of model was studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite from the point of view of the entropy production and memory effects . in this paper , keeping in mind putative experimental realisation of such a type of systems , we are going to discuss the two - temperatures situation reformulated in terms of the two - dimensional diffusion of a brownian particle in a parabolic potential .",
    "the diffusion process is defined in terms of langevin dynamics with two different effective temperatures in the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 directions . in the stationary state",
    "this system is described by a non - trivial distribution function @xmath2 , which can be computed explicitly . unlike for the equilibrium case ( @xmath10 ) , this non - equilibrium stationary state is characterised by the presence of nontrivial space dependent particle s flows @xmath11 . moreover ,",
    "these flows exhibit a `` symmetry breaking '' rotor , @xmath12 ( directed perpendicular to the @xmath13-plain ) , the sign ( or the direction ) of which is determined by the temperature difference @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we define our model and present the explicit solution for the stationary particle s probability distribution function @xmath2 . in section [ obs ]",
    "we compute putative `` observable '' quantities of the system , such as the variances of the particle displacements in the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 directions , the rotor @xmath15 of the particle s flows as well as the average rotation velocity . in section [ sims ]",
    "we report the results of the numerical simulations and compare them with our analytical predictions .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we conclude with a brief recapitulation of our results .",
    "we consider stochastic , over - damped langevin dynamics of a particle moving in a two - dimensional space in a presence of an external potential @xmath16 .",
    "the particle instantaneous position @xmath17 is defined by projections on the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 axes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is described by following equations : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is _ anisotropic _ stochastic noise , with zero mean and correlation function @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two _ different _ `` temperatures '' and @xmath16 has the following parabolic form : @xmath25 the shape of the potential is controlled by the parameter @xmath26 . to keep the particle localised near the origin",
    ", we have to impose the constraint @xmath27 .",
    "this follows from the requirement that both eigenvalues of the potential , @xmath28 , must be positive ; in the case @xmath29 , there is a direction in the plane @xmath30 at which the potential @xmath16 has a negative curvature which allows the particle to escape to infinity .    in the stationary regime ,",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath2 of the particle position obeys the stationary fokker - planck equation : @xmath31 \\ ; + \\ ; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\bigl [ t_{y}\\frac{\\partial p(x , y)}{\\partial y }   \\ ;   + \\ ;     p(x , y ) \\frac{\\partial u(x , y)}{\\partial y } \\bigr ] \\ ; = \\ ; 0\\ ] ] in the trivial isotropic case , @xmath32 , the solution of the above equation is simply the equilibrium gibbs distribution @xmath33 .",
    "one can easily show that in the generic _ anisotropic _ case with arbitrary @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the solution of the stationary equation ( [ 5 ] ) reads : @xmath34 where the following shortenings have been used @xmath35 and @xmath36 further on , @xmath37 is the normalisation constant ( the `` partition function '' ) , defined as @xmath38 one immediately observes that @xmath37 exists , so that the system has the stationary solution , only for @xmath27 .",
    "using the above probability distribution function we can straightforwardly calculate the variances of the particles position with respect to the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 axes : @xmath39 the characteristic quantity , which can serve as the measure of anisotropy in the system under study , is defined as the ratio of these two quantities : @xmath40 in the trivial decoupled case , @xmath41 , we find @xmath42 , while in the isotropic case , @xmath10 we have @xmath43 for all values of the coupling parameter @xmath26 .",
    "note next that in the strongly anisotropic case , e.g. , when @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 in other words , in the strongly anisotropic case the values of both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are defined by the largest @xmath48 , while the value of the ratio @xmath49 becomes a @xmath48-independent constant .      in the stationary case",
    "the current @xmath50 is defined as follows : @xmath51 using eqs.([4])-([6 ] ) we obtain : @xmath52 \\ , p(x , y ) \\\\",
    "\\label{21 } j_{y } & = & \\bigl[(1 - t_{y}\\gamma_{2 } ) y + u ( 1 - t_{y}\\gamma_{3 } ) x    \\bigr ] \\ ,",
    "p(x , y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the isotropic case , @xmath32 , we have @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 . in the anisotropic case",
    "@xmath9 the above non - trivial pattern of currents can be characterised in terms of the rotor : @xmath55 in general , the rotor @xmath15 is a rather complicated function of two variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but it is remarkable that the function @xmath15 has a non - zero ( and very simple ) value at the origin at @xmath56 : @xmath57 note that this quantity changes sign from minus ( `` left rotation '' ) at @xmath58 , to plus ( `` right rotation '' ) at @xmath59 .    due to the presence of a non - zero particle s current rotor",
    ", one finds that the mean particle s rotation velocity is also non - zero .",
    "indeed , for a given value of the particle s linear velocity @xmath60 located in the point @xmath61 on the two - dimensional plane , its angular velocity is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the vector product directed along the @xmath64-axis .",
    "thus , the mean rotation velocity @xmath65 in the limit of an infinite observation time can be defined as follows : @xmath66 changing averaging over time by averaging over ensemble ( which will be justified in what follows by numerical simulations ) we get : @xmath67 here the average current @xmath68 is defined in eqs.([20])-([21 ] ) . according to eq.([6 ] ) , the probability distribution function @xmath69 can be represented as follows @xmath70 where @xmath71 substituting the explicit expressions for the components @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the current , eqs.([20])-([21 ] ) , and using eqs.([7])-([10 ] ) , we get @xmath74 substituting eq.([29 ] ) into eq.([26 ] ) and performing simple integrations we obtain @xmath75 where the parameter @xmath76 is defined in eq.([10 ] )",
    ".    one can easily prove that the maximal value of the mean angular velocity is @xmath77 , and it is achieved either in the limits @xmath78 ( which corresponds to @xmath79 for finite @xmath23 ) or in the limit @xmath80 ( which corresponds to @xmath81 for a finite @xmath24 ) , and the value of the coupling parameter @xmath82 .",
    "to verify our analytical predictions and the underlying assumption that the time - average can be replaced by the ensemble average , we perform numerical simulations of appropriately discretised langevin equations eqs.([1 ] ) . substituting the potential @xmath83 into eqs.([1 ] )",
    "we first write these equations explicitly : @xmath84 where the variances of the thermal noise components are defined by @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ".    discretising eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta0 ] ) with a time step @xmath88 , we have : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are delta - correlated random numbers with gaussian distribution of unit half - width , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , which are the conditions of a smooth motion . in that case for a free motion of a particle ( @xmath94 ) which starts at the origin ( @xmath95 ) , the diffusion coefficients are @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the variances of the displacement are given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in the case of the symmetric potential ( @xmath41 ) , one has in the stationary regime @xmath100 and @xmath101 , independently of @xmath102 . for asymmetric potential @xmath103 , we will compute the mean angular velocity @xmath104 given in eq.([25 ] ) and the measure of anisotropy @xmath105 that is described by eq.([14 ] ) .",
    "the numerical simulation has been done for the time step @xmath106 .",
    "the averaging has been performed over the total time period @xmath107 time units , the numerical inaccuracy has been evaluated by splitting the whole time interval into @xmath108 sub - intervals . in fig .  [",

    "we also show our analytical predictions in eq.([14 ] ) and eq.([25 ] ) , respectively , and find a perfect agreement .",

    "in the present work we studied a simple stochastic `` toy model '' with only two degrees of freedom which are connected to two thermostats maintained at two _ different _ temperatures @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . the model describes diffusion of a particle on a two - dimensional plane in a presence of a parabolic potential such that the stochastic noises in the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 directions have different strength ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ) .",
    "we determine the stationary state probability distribution function for the position of the particle . despite its relatively simple structure",
    ", it turns out to be rather non - trivial , revealing interesting qualitative physical phenomena . in particular , in the stationary state one finds a rather sophisticated pattern of particles density currents ( which would be identically equal to zero in the equilibrium case ) characterised by the non - zero rotor .",
    "moreover , due to the presence of this flux rotor one observes the phenomenon which could be interpreted as a `` spontaneous symmetry breaking '' , namely one finds non - zero value for the average particle s rotation ( around the origin ) velocity .",
    "this value is proportional to @xmath116 , eq.([30 ] ) , being positive ( left rotation ) for @xmath117 and negative ( right rotation ) for @xmath118 .    it should be stressed , however , that except for recently proposed two - temperature electric analog system @xcite , for the moment the considered model has no experimental realization .",
    "thus , the aim of the present work is somewhat provocative : we would like argue that the systems of such type are sufficiently interesting to stimulate investigations for their `` hardware '' implementations .",
    "we also believe that modifications of our toy model towards a system that could be realised in practice and at the same time would not loose its interesting behavior ( rotation ) , is possible .",
