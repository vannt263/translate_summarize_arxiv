    "the sunyaevzeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1972 ) is the inverse - compton scattering of the cmb radiation by hot , ionised gas in the gravitational potential well of a cluster of galaxies ; for reviews on the sz effect ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is useful in a number of ways for the study of galaxy clusters ; here we are concerned with two in particular .",
    "first , because the sz effect arises from a scattering process , a cluster at one redshift will produce the same observed sz surface brightness as an identical cluster at any other redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "the integrated sz flux does depend on the angular diameter distance and therefore the redshift @xmath11 , but the dependence is small at @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the usual sensitivity issue of high - redshift observing is avoided , which is particularly useful for this study .",
    "second , since the sz surface brightness is proportional to the line - of - sight integral of pressure through the cluster , the sz signal is less sensitive to concentration than the x - ray bremsstrahlung signal ; one corollary of this is that the ratio sz - sensitivity / x - ray - sensitivity increases with distance from the cluster centre so that with sz one can probe out to , say , the virial radius , provided the telescope is sensitive to sufficiently large angular scales .",
    "sz decrements are faint , however , and can be contaminated or obliterated by sources of radio emission .",
    "many sz studies are currently and routinely carried out at different redshift ranges by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the _ planck _ satellite ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the south pole telescope ( spt ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) has demonstrated its capability of studying x - ray selected clusters of galaxies at moderate @xmath11 , ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , however always at relatively low redshift . here",
    "we investigate the feasibility of observing and detecting clusters at higher ( @xmath13 ) redshift as well as constraining their masses .",
    "@xcite selected a sample of 11 clusters at ( @xmath14 ) from infrared and x - ray studies , and observed these with the sza to search for sz signal .",
    "they found sz decrements towards 3 of the clusters ; using x - ray based values of @xmath7 , they also estimated @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( from the @xmath17-@xmath18 scaling relation of @xcite ) . here , we present ami observations of the subsample of 6 ( of the original 11 ) clusters which are at @xmath19 , along with bayesian inference where possible .",
    "our initial aims were to :    1 .",
    "follow up the sza observations with an instrument with different systematics ; 2 .   consider the effects of difference in analysis procedures used by @xcite ( from x - ray measurements near the cluster centre , and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ; these assumptions are often made in the literature ) and by ourselves ( temperature from sz observation plus m - t relation from virial theorem , as well as bayesian and probability search ) .",
    "the names , coordinates and redshifts of the sample are shown in table [ tab : summary ] .    in section [ sec : ami ]",
    "we briefly review ami and then describe the observational programme in section [ sec : observations ] .",
    "the data reduction and bayesian analysis are explained in section [ sec : data_red ] .",
    "we have conducted realistic ami simulations using x - ray measured parameters to model the galaxy cluster and discuss their validity in section [ sec : simulations ] , present the sa analysis in section [ sec : sa_results ] and the la follow - up of two clusters in section [ sec : la_followup ] . throughout",
    ", we assume @xmath20 kms@xmath21mpc@xmath21 and a concordance @xmath22cdm cosmology with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) is a dual interferometric array , near cambridge .",
    "it consists of an 8-element large array ( la ) with dishes of 12.8 m and the small array ( sa ) , a 10-dish array with an antenna size of 3.7 m each .",
    "both arrays observe at a central frequency of 15.75 ghz and their configuration is optimised for the specific scientific area they were conceived for .",
    "the main characteristics of ami are summarised in table [ tab : ami_specs ] and are described in greater detail in @xcite .",

    "for our two sa sz detections , xmj0830 + 5241 and clj1415 + 3612 , we carry out additional follow - up observations with the la .",
    "as both clusters are at high redshift ( 0.99 and 1.03 respectively ) we aim to investigate whether these clusters angular extent would be better geared to the baseline range of the la and hence improve parameter estimations .",
    "note that our bayesian analysis expects the cluster s imprint to be an extended feature and hence have a different profile as a function of _",
    "uv_-distance than a point source . from our sa analysis",
    ", we find @xmath30and @xmath31  for clj1415 + 3612 and xmj0830 + 5241 , respectively .",
    "as the angular resolution of the la is @xmath32 using all of its baselines , these two clusters will be resolved by the la .",
    "however , the trade - off is that the la can not access the _",
    "uv_-points that have the most significant sz signal .",
    "we note that the maps agree with what we expect ; the la map of xmj0830 + 5241 ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : xmj0830_lamap ] ) show a @xmath8-@xmath9 decrement which agrees with the sa position .",
    "after source - subtraction ( fig .",
    "[ subfig : xmj0830s_lamap ] ) , we manage to recover a @xmath33 decrement .",
    "the deep follow - up clj1415 + 3612 is swamped by the @xmath34mjy located on top of the cluster position , as shown in fig .",
    "[ subfig : clj1415_lamap ] .",
    "after source - subtraction , there is a small , just over @xmath8-@xmath9 , decrement in the source - subtracted map whose position agrees with the sa observation .",
    "we can not do any bayesian analysis of the la data with our current models , which require application of the virial theorem internal to @xmath35 , because the la is not able to measure up to an angular scale which corresponds to @xmath35 .",
    "the current parameterisation in , however , uses @xmath36 as sampling parameter , hence , unconstrained @xmath36 or @xmath35 measurements result in any other profile parameters remaining unconstrained .",
    "although recovers positions in both cases which seem to agree with the locations of the respective cluster , the results of this analysis remain questionable as no detection probabilities nor parameter estimates could be derived .",
    "ami has observed a declination - limited subset of six of the @xcite sample .    1 .",
    "three of these targets ( iscs1438 + 34 , rdj0910 + 5422 , xmj0849 + 4452 ) suffered from heavy radio source contamination which inhibited a detection . using a mass estimate from @xcite of spj1638 + 4039 and simulating a typical ami - sa observation of the target , which predicts a thermal sz effect that is below the detection threshold of our telescope .",
    "hence , we believe the mass of spj1638 + 4039 to be too small to be detected by the sa .",
    "two are firm detections ( clj1415 + 3612 , xmj0830 + 5241 ) with the sa , with bayesian evidence ratio @xmath37 of @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . in the case of clj1415 + 3612 ,",
    "ami is able to find a @xmath40 detection compared to @xmath41 on the sza despite the thermal sz effect being a factor of @xmath42 fainter at ami s frequency band .",
    "similarly , the integrated flux density of xmj0830 + 5241 is higher than expected in the sa data ( @xmath43 ) compared to the sza measured integrated flux density , if only taking into account the difference in intensity of the thermal sz effect between 30 and 15 ghz .",
    "3 .   in the subset of six",
    ", ami detects in sz the same clusters ( clj1415 + 3612 , xmj0830 + 5241 ) as @xcite with the sza .",
    "the ami data and analysis , however , return parameters internal to @xmath35 ( @xmath44 virial radius ) . for clj1415 + 3612 and xmj0830 + 5241 respectively , our @xmath1-model , route finds @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while our dm - gnfw model finds @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "4 .   in using the x - ray data internal to @xmath7 from @xcite to simulate what ami should see at larger radius ,",
    "we have highlighted three causes of bias with respect to reality , when deriving parameters from sz measurements if the modelling relies on x - ray data from the central region of the clusters .",
    "we find sz effects in the higher - resolution follow - up observation of clj1415 + 3612 and xmj0830 + 5241 carried out with ami la .",
