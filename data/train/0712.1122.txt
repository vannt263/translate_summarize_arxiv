    "x - ray spectral measurements of the iron line and the underlying continuum provide a powerful tool to study accretion discs in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black holes ( for a review see fabian et al.@xcite ; reynolds & nowak @xcite ) .",
    "if a line originates by reflection of the primary continuum , then its observed characteristics may reveal rapid orbital motion and light bending near the central black hole .",
    "spectral characteristics can be employed to constrain the black hole mass and angular momentum . a particularly important role is played by the equivalent width ( ew ) , which reflects the intensity of the line versus the continuum flux as well as the role of general relativity effects in the source . in order to reduce the ambiguity of results one needs to perform spectral fitting with self - consistent models of both the line and continuum .",
    "some agn are known to exhibit ew greater than expected for a `` classical '' accretion disc .",
    "enhanced values for the ew can be obtained by assuming an anisotropical distribution of the primary x - rays ( ghisellini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , significant ionization of the disc matter ( matt , fabian & ross @xcite ) or iron overabundance ( george & fabian @xcite ) .",
    "martocchia & matt ( @xcite ) and martocchia et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found , using an axisymmetric lamp - post scheme , an anticorrelation between the intensity of the reflection features and the primary flux .",
    "when the primary source is at a low height on the disc axis , the ew can be increased by up to an order of magnitude with respect to calculations neglecting general relativity effects . when allowing the source to be located off the axis of rotation , an even stronger enhancement is expected ( dabrowski & lasenby @xcite ) .",
    "miniutti et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and miniutti & fabian ( @xcite ) have realised that this so - called light bending model can naturally explain the puzzling behaviour of the iron line of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , when the line saturates at a certain flux level and then its ew starts decreasing as the continuum flux increases further .",
    "clear understanding of the interplay between the primary and the reprocessed components is therefore highly desirable .    in our previous paper ( doviak et al .",
    "2004a ) , we have proposed that the orbiting spot model could explain the origin of transient narrow lines , which have been reported in some agn x - ray spectra ( turner et al .",
    "2002 ; guainazzi 2003 ; yaqoob et al",
    ".  2003 ) and widely discussed since then .",
    "the main purpose of the current paper is to present accurate computations of time - dependent ews and other spectral characteristics within the framework of the spot model , taking into account a consistent scheme for the local spectrum reprocessing .",
    "the main difference from previous papers is that the current one connects the primary source power - law continuum with the reprocessed spectral features .",
    "both components are further modified by relativistic effects as the signal propagates towards an observer .    in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the model and we summarize the equations and the approximation used . in section [ results ] we present the results of our calculations .",
    "the final conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we examine a system composed by a black hole , an accretion disc and a co - rotating flare with the spot underneath ( collin et al .",
    "@xcite ; see fig .  [ fig - model ] ) .",
    "the gravitational field is described in terms of kerr metric ( misner , thorne & wheeler @xcite ) .",
    "both static schwarzschild and rotating kerr black holes are considered .",
    "the co - rotating keplerian accretion disc is geometrically thin and optically thick , therefore we take into account only photons coming from the equatorial plane directly to the observer .",
    "we further assume that the matter in the accretion disc is cold and neutral .",
    "a flare is supposed to arise in the disc corona due to a magnetic reconnection event ( e.g.  galeev , rosner & vaiana @xcite ; poutanen & fabian @xcite ; merloni & fabian @xcite ; czerny et al .",
    "details of the formation of the flare and its structure are not the subject of the present paper instead we assume that the flare is an isotropic stationary point source with a power - law spectrum .",
    "it is located very near above the disc surface and it co - rotates with the accretion disc .",
    "we also assume that the single flare dominates the intrinsic emission for a certain period of time .",
    "the question of the flare height above the accretion disc is still unresolved . although there are some similarities between the reconnection events that are responsible for solar flares and those in accretion discs ( romanova et al .",
    "1998 ; czerny et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not yet clear to what height the magnetic loops can rise in the latter case .",
    "for example , dabrowski & lasenby ( 2001 ) _ assumed _ a large height ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) of the flare above the inner disc region and they performed the ray tracing from the flare towards the disc surface and further to the observer . on the other hand , here we assume that the flare height is less than the gravitational radius , which seems to be substantiated by the condition of equipartition between the magnetic and gas pressure , but the confirmation will need coupled radiation - magnetohydrodynamic computations , which have been only recently started ( e.g. blaes et al .",
    "the small height allows us to simplify the calculations of the disc irradiation by neglecting the light - bending on primary rays , so that we can study off - axis flares and manage the time - dependent evolution of the observed flux , ew and other characteristics .",
    "the spot represents the flare - illuminated part of the disc surface .",
    "the flare can be viewed as a lamp .",
    "the reprocessed photons are re - emitted from only those parts of the disc that are illuminated by the flare .",
    "therefore the spot does not share the differential rotation with the disc material .",
    "it is considered to be a rigid two dimensional circular feature , with its centre directly below the flare .",
    "however , the matter in the disc lit by the flare is in keplerian orbits at the corresponding radii , thus it has different velocities at different parts of the spot .",
    "this is important when calculating the transfer function for the observer in the infinity .",
    "because the flare is very close to the disc , the spot does not extend far from below the flare .",
    "only photons emitted into the lower hemisphere reach the disc .",
    "we assume the opening angle of the illuminating cone to be @xmath4 which means we lose less than 2% of these photons .",
    "we neglect the photons emitted into the upper hemisphere directed towards the black hole that could possibly reach the disc behind it .",
    "we approximate the photon trajectories between the flare and the spot by straight lines .",
    "we do not consider the energy shift and abberation due to the different motion of the flare and the illuminated disc matter .",
    "as far as the illumination is concerned we consider the flare and the spot to be in the same co - moving reference frame .",
    "thus the illumination of the spot is approximated by a simple cosine law in the local keplerian frame co - moving with the matter in the spot and decreasing with the distance from the flare ( i.e.  illuminating flux @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the cosine of the incident angle in the local keplerian frame and @xmath7 is the height of the flare above the disc ) .",
    "furthermore we neglect the time delay between the photon s emission from the flare and its later re - emission from the spot .",
    "the intrinsic ( local ) spectra from the spot were computed by monte carlo simulations considering multiple compton scattering and iron line fluorescence in a cold , neutral , constant density slab with solar iron abundance .",
    "we used the noar code for these computations ( see section 5 of dumont et al .",
    "@xcite and chapter 5 of goosmann @xcite ) .",
    "the local flux depends on the local incident and local emission angles , hence the flux changes across the spot . here and elsewhere in the text",
    "we refer to the quantities measured in the local frame co - moving with the matter in the disc as `` local '' .",
    "the local flux consists of only two components  the flux from the primary source ( the flare ) and the reflected flux from the spot .",
    "the latter one consists of the reflection continuum ( with the compton hump and the iron edge as the main features ) and the neutral k@xmath8 and k@xmath9 iron lines .",
    "no other emission is taken into account .",
    "as far as the photon trajectories from the spot to the observer are concerned , all general relativistic effects  energy shift , aberration , light bending , lensing and relative time delays  are taken into account .",
    "we assume that only the gravity of the central black hole influences photons on their travel from the disc to the observer .",
    "this allows us to define a relatively simple scheme in which different intervening effects remain under full control and can be well identified .",
    "the observed energy flux from the finite size spot on the accretion disc , @xmath10 , can be computed from the local energy flux , @xmath11 ( doviak @xcite ; doviak et .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an area element on the disc , @xmath14 is the emission time , @xmath15 is a relative time delay with which photons emitted at different places on the disc reach the observer ( we use boyer - lindquist spheroidal coordinates ; misner et al .",
    "@xcite ) . note that we use the specific energy flux ( not the photon flux ) per unit solid angle ( not per unit area ) , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "hence the units are kev / s / kev for spectra ( kev / s for integrated energy flux in light curves ) .",
    "one can get the flux per unit area of the detector by dividing our results by the distance of the source squared .    in a classical ( non - relativistic ) case , when there is no light bending and aberration , the relative time delay would be @xmath17 ( the observer is located in the direction @xmath18 ) .",
    "the transfer function ( see cunningham @xcite ) for an extended source is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the combined gravitational and doppler shift , @xmath21 is lensing and @xmath22 is the cosine of the local emission angle at the disc ( measured with respect to the frame co - moving with the disc ) .",
    "all these functions depend on the place of the emission ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the disc ) .",
    "because the local flux is coming from an orbiting spot it is useful to use coordinates co - moving with the spot s centre .",
    "the observed flux is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27.\\ ] ] this equation defines @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ flux2 ] ) as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath30 is the angular velocity of the spot .",
    "the factor @xmath31 arises from the coordinate transformation @xmath32 ( it is connected with the time delays ) .",
    "this is due to the spot moving in its orbit towards or away from the observer and due to the fact that the light rays emitted from different places on the disc are differently bent , thus acquiring different travel times .",
    "therefore we will refer to this factor as the delay amplification , @xmath33^{-1}\\ .\\ ] ]    similarly as for the spot emission one gets an expression for the observed energy flux from the primary source , the flare , which we suppose is a point - like source @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the transfer function for a point - like source and the emission time @xmath36 together with the azimuthal coordinate @xmath24 are both functions of the observer s time @xmath29 as defined in eqs .",

    "( [ reflected_flux ] ) we used the fact that the solid angle @xmath43 corresponds to the area @xmath44 perpendicular to the light ray emitted from the spot in the following way : @xmath45 here , @xmath7 is the height of the primary source above the disc , @xmath46 is the area of the spot lit by the emission coming from the solid angle @xmath43 , @xmath47 is the corresponding area perpendicular to the incident light ray and @xmath6 is the cosine of the incident angle .",
    "all these quantities are evaluated in the local reference frame co - moving with the disc .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the emitted photon flux @xmath48 was calculated by monte carlo simulations . in our computations we used pre - calculated tables of @xmath49 which were averaged over the difference between incident and emitted azimuthal angles @xmath50 .      because the flare is very near above the disc the spot receives the light emitted downward to almost the whole half - space .",

    "the emission angle is important for the extended source not only as part of the transfer function but also as a variable that the reflected component @xmath86 of the local flux depends on heavily , as can be seen from the left panel in the fig .",
    "[ fig - ratio_loc ]  the local flux changes by one order of magnitude for the full range of angles .",
    "the emission angle can change dramatically for higher inclinations during the whole orbit , and for @xmath87 in the kerr case it acquires almost all possible values .",

    "[ fig - tf2 ] one can see what is the overall observed amplification of the local flux from the centre of the spot ( extended source ) and from the flare ( point source ) . because the overall amplification of the flare s flux has one @xmath20-factor more , the flux from the flare is more amplified where @xmath88 and less in the other case . for larger inclinations",
    "the overall amplification has a larger maximum in the kerr case , because of the larger lensing effect , doppler shift and delay amplification , whereas for lower inclinations it is lower because of the much smaller gravitational shift .",

    ".    a closer look at the ew reveals that it does not much differ from its local value except for the kerr case with an observer inclination of @xmath83 . from eq .",

    "for an almost edge - on disc it can vary by as much as 200% .    the observed ratio of the reflected flux to the primary flux is amplified when compared to the local one .",
    "again , the approximation of a small spot can not be used .",
    "the amplification is the highest in the kerr case with @xmath87  the ratio is increased by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "note that in the kerr case , for the inclinations @xmath92 and @xmath83 the ratio of the observed reflected flux to the observed primary flux is larger than unity , meaning the reflected component prevails over the primary one . because the primary flux is energy - dependent ( a power - law ) , this ratio depends on energy , too .",
    "one can ask what is the maximum and the minimum value of this ratio over the whole orbit .",
    "the energy dependence of this ratio is shown in the middle right ( including the line emission ) and right ( without the line ) panels in fig .",
    "[ fig - ew ] .",
    "if the reflected continuum were without features ( fe lines and the edge ) , the ratio would just slightly decrease with energy because of the power - law local primary flux ( see e.g. 58  kev and above 10  kev regions for @xmath87 , top line , in the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "the fe edge causes more complicated behaviour of this ratio when it influences the minimum ( see 810  kev region for @xmath87 , top line , in the schwarzschild case ) , or ( together with the flux originating in the iron line ) the maximum ( see e.g. 3.86.3kev and 4.35.2kev region for @xmath82 , bottom line , in schwarzschild case ) .",
    "to evaluate the hardness ratio we compared the fluxes in between 36.5 kev ( soft component , @xmath56 ) and 6.510 kev ( hard component , @xmath55 ) .",

    "the sudden increase in the observed hardness ratio around the time @xmath95 in schwarzschild case and @xmath96 in kerr case is due to the fact that the fe k@xmath8 line passes from the soft to the hard component and back because of the doppler shift .",

    "@xcite ) . as an example of the two sets of parameters ( a schwarzschild black hole versus an extremally spinning kerr black hole ) we find that all components of the transfer function  the energy shifts ( doppler and gravitational ) , aberration effects ( which are in the interplay with the limb darkening / brightening laws ) and the lensing  are important and need to be taken into account . as the spot is orbiting rapidly in the inner regions of the accretion disc , timing is also essential .",
    "motion results in the delay amplification , which is again in a complex interplay with the bending of light near the black hole ; this is described by eq .",
    "( [ kt ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that whereas the significance of the energy shift and lensing effect has already been widely studied , the effect of the finite light travel time has not been discussed much , in spite of the fact that it significantly affects the resulting signal and causes an additional enhancement of the observed flux , especially in the case of a fast - rotating black hole .",
    "although this light time effect arises as an immediate consequence of the finite velocity of light , its mutual interplay with the light bending and focusing is rather complicated .",
    "we thus examined this time delay amplification in some detail .",
    "our results also confirm what has been long suspected , namely , that the local reprocessing in the disc medium and the signal propagation through the curved spacetime are all mutually interconnected in a rather complex manner .",
    "we have demonstrated that various integral characteristics of the spectral features ( such as equivalent widths ) are at best moderately sensitive to the black hole rotation .",
    "the equivalent width could be significantly amplified in our model only if the primary emission were beamed towards the disc , thus decreasing the observed primary emission .",
    "both the ratio of the observed reflected to the observed primary flux and the hardness ratio are amplified when compared to the values for the intrinsic ( local ) emission .",
    "in addition to the shown cases , we also performed our computations for some other values of the spin of the black hole and orbital radius of the spot .",
    "we found out that the results do not differ significantly for different spin when the radius is kept the same .",
    "we examined the cases with @xmath78 and @xmath76 with @xmath98 and the cases with @xmath78 and @xmath99 with @xmath91 ( the spin in the latter case could not be lower if the spot should be above the marginally stable orbit ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral characteristics depend on the orbital radius mainly close to the black hole whereas father away their variability either does not change significantly or slowly decreases .    the main conclusions of this work are summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   all general and special relativistic effects are important , none of them can be neglected .",
    "the ew , apart for the extreme cases of high inclinations , does not differ significantly from the local ew , however it varies even for low inclination of 30@xmath100 by up to 30% when compared with its mean value for the whole orbit .",
    "3 .   the variability of the reflected to the primary flux ratio and hardness ratio changes rapidly with the radius if the spot orbits close to the black hole .",
    "the spin of the black hole affects significantly our results only as far as it determines the location of the marginally stable orbit .",
    "it follows from the last two points that the flux ratios could be used for estimating the lower limit of possible values of the spin parameter if the flare arises in the close vicinity of the black hole .",
    "we must emphasize that nowadays x - ray satellite observatories usually do not have enough sensitivity to be suitable for real fitting with our model .",
    "however , future satellite missions like xeus or constellation - x will enable to spectroscopically follow the motion of individual spots close to the innermost stable orbit in active galactic nuclei ( goosmann et al .",
    "the azimuthally - dependent effects on the iron line band that we investigate in this paper can thus be used to constrain the emission structure and the metric around supermassive black holes .",
