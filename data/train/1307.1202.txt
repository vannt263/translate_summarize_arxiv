    "the foundation of general relativity is the equivalence principle ( ep ) , the weak version of which states that inertial mass and gravitational mass are identical .",
    "attempts to unify general relativity with the standard model of particle physics generically predict the existence of new fields with gravitational - strength couplings to existing standard - model fields .",
    "but these couplings are not universal , in contrast to the coupling between standard - model fields and the metric or spin - two graviton field of general relativity .",
    "hence they introduce differences in the accelerations of test bodies in the same gravitational field , violating the ep .",
    "such violations can be quantified with the parameter @xmath0 , defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gravitational mass and @xmath4 is the inertial mass . in some theories @xmath0",
    "is associated with gravitational self - energy @xmath5 , so that @xmath6 , and experimental constraints on @xmath0 effectively translate into upper limits on a universal constant @xmath7 @xcite . in others ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 may in principle vary from object to object depending on composition or other factors @xcite .",
    "three main approaches have been taken in testing the ep .",
    "the oldest , and in principle the simplest , is to drop two objects with different properties in the same gravitational field ( as may have been done by galileo using a lead musketball and iron cannonball at pisa , and was definitely done by some of his contemporaries , such as simon stevin using lead balls in delft ) . for these early investigators ,",
    "the main property of interest was test - body mass .",
    "nowadays we might be more interested in composition .",
    "all energy gravitates , but all forms of energy may not couple in the same way to the new fields predicted by modern unified theories . in `` runaway dilaton '' versions of string theory copper and beryllium fall at different rates due to factors involving differences in electromagnetic binding energy @xcite .",
    "modest extensions of the standard model with a single minimally - coupled scalar field predict ep violations for test materials such as aluminum and beryllium due primarily to couplings between this field and gluons , the gauge fields of quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "other theories involving `` little strings '' @xcite , time - varying fundamental `` constants '' @xcite , `` chameleon fields '' @xcite and generic violations of lorentz symmetry @xcite have similar consequences .",
    "the scale of predicted ep violations in these theories is however very small , of order @xmath8 or less . to detect them ,",
    "modern versions of galileo s drop - tower experiment must be carried out in space , where macroscopic test bodies can fall continuously in a disturbance - free environment over many orbits around the earth .",
    "one such experiment , microscope , is designed to measure the relative accelerations of two pairs of test masses composed of platinum and titanium alloys with a sensitivity of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "another , the satellite test of the equivalence principle ( step ) , aims to reach a sensitivity of @xmath10 through the use of superconducting accelerometers , and to monitor four pairs of beryllium , niobium and platinum - iridium test masses @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to reach comparable levels of precision with _ microscopic _ test particles using atom interferometry in the laboratory @xcite or in space , as in the proposed space - time explorer and quantum equivalence principle space test ( ste - quest ) @xcite .",
    "at present such techniques are limited to different isotopic pairs of the same element , such as rubidium-85 and 87 , but experiments involving lithium and cesium are envisioned for the future @xcite .",
    "the second historical approach to tests of equivalence makes use of sensitive torsion balances to compare the accelerations of different objects in what is effectively a horizontal component of the gravitational field of the earth , sun or milky way .",
    "pioneered by etvs in the nineteenth century , this technique has produced the strongest current constraint on ep violation , limiting any difference in acceleration of beryllium and titanium in the field of the earth to less than @xmath11 @xcite .    the third ep testing strategy , and the one that is the focus of this work , follows from newton s realization that nature provides a `` free '' way to test our theories of gravity in the form of the continuously falling moons and planets of the solar system @xcite .",
    "celestial ep tests open up regions of parameter space inaccessible to terrestrial experiment ( for example , comparing the accelerations of what are effectively a ball of hydrogen and a ball of rock and metal ) .",
    "however they are not generally as sensitive as torsion - balance experiments or proposed free - fall tests in space .",
    "the major exception so far involves the phenomenon of orbital polarization ( the nordtvedt effect ) , whereby the elliptical orbit of one body around a second becomes gradually aligned along the direction to a third , introducing anomalous variations in distance between the first two bodies .",
    "laser ranging using retroreflectors left on the moon by apollo astronauts has made it possible to limit any such difference in accelerations of the earth and moon toward the sun to less than @xmath12 , comparable to the constraint from torsion balances @xcite .",
    "ranging to mars may someday produce comparable results @xcite .",
    "violations of the ep by solar system bodies also reveal themselves in modifications of kepler s third law and migrations of stable lagrange points @xcite .",
    "these effects do not generally produce individual limits as strong as those from orbital polarization @xcite .",
    "however , they constrain two linearly independent combinations of @xmath0 parameters , and are therefore particularly useful in testing theories for which the value of @xmath0 can differ from object to object .",
    "this method has been applied , for example , to put the strongest current limits on extensions of general relativity to higher dimensions , where static , spherically symmetric objects like stars or planets are models by generalizations of the schwarzschild metric known as",
    "_ solitons _ @xcite . our goal in this paper is to extend and strengthen this way of testing the ep using updated ephemerides and considering more objects , including additional jupiter trojans as well as companions of the earth , mars , neptune and saturn s moons tethys and dione .",

    "the other solar - system bodies we have considered here are all constrained for the first time by these results .",
    "any other theories that predict explicit ep violation on macroscopic scales would be subject to similar constraints .",
    "most theories that involve ep violation in principle do not make such concrete predictions for @xmath0 .",
    "they do , however , agree that the degree of ep violation will depend in some way on _ composition _ @xcite .",
    "this is because of the presence of new fields that couple non - universally but with gravitational strength to the constituents of the standard model . in the absence of a definitive theory ,",
    "the standard way to characterize such ep violations is to define a phase space of the most plausible observables , such as baryon number , neutron excess and electrostatic binding energy . in designing a experiment ,",
    "one hopes to drop test materials that span the largest possible volume in this space , while also ensuring that any signal seen is as robust as possible @xcite .",
    "here we extend this phenomenological approach to the solar system , combining our upper limits on ep violation by the sun , planets and satellites with compositional data on each body to extract upper limits on @xmath0 for individual constituent elements themselves .",
    "given the theoretical uncertainties , we take the simplest possible approach in which ep violation by a macroscopic body is due entirely to a single constituent , neglecting possible internal cancelation or other effects .",
    "this means that we are effectively comparing the acceleration of that one element to the rest of the periodic table .",
    "thus , for example , the bulk composition of the sun consists of 72% hydrogen and 27% helium by mass @xcite . assuming that any ep violation by the sun can effectively be associated with a single element , our limit of @xmath204 for",
    "the sun would imply that @xmath220 for hydrogen or @xmath221 for helium . these are in fact our best bounds on these two elements from solar - system observations .",
    "jupiter s atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass , and the comparable fractions for saturn are 79% and 21% @xcite , but our upper limits on @xmath0 for these planets are much weaker than that for the sun .",

    "saturn s icy satellites tethys and dione constitute a particularly tempting ep test case , since cassini has confirmed that one ( tethys ) consists of 93% water ice by mass while the other ( dione ) is 50% silicate rock @xcite .",
    "( in elemental terms these numbers translate into 86%  o and 4%  si by mass for tethys vs. 74%  o and 20%  si for dione . )",
    "as both have trojan companions , they can be constrained not only by the combination of kepler s third law and orbital polarization , but by the migration of their stable lagrange points as well .",
    "moreover , we have excellent data on both moons and their trojan companions from cassini . however , for the reasons discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : individual ] , the upper limits on @xmath0 for both bodies are still comparatively weak .",
    "the best elemental limits in every case turn out to be those derived from the earth , whose upper bound on @xmath0 is two or more orders of magnitude stronger than any of the other terrestrial planets .",
    "we have looked for the constraints imposed by solar system data on theories in which the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass differs from unity by a factor @xmath0 which may in principle differ from body to body . for two objects characterized by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , upper bounds on the sum @xmath224 are set by kepler s third law , while the difference @xmath225 is constrained by the position of lagrange libration points and orbital polarization in the field of a third body ( the nordtvedt effect ) .",
    "( here @xmath226 and @xmath227 are known constants . ) combining these results , we have extracted independent upper limits on @xmath0 for the sun , moon , planets and saturnian moons tethys and dione using experimental data on their mean motions and positions as well as those of their trojan companions where applicable .",
    "we find that @xmath228 for the earth and sun , @xmath229 for the moon , mars and venus , @xmath230 for mercury , jupiter , saturn , tethys and dione , and @xmath231 for uranus and neptune .",
    "as a test case , we have applied our results to kaluza - klein gravity , in which @xmath0 depends on a metric parameter related to the curvature of an extra dimension near the central mass .",
    "our upper bounds on this parameter are orders of magnitude stronger than existing limits from any other tests , and confirm earlier conclusions that a fifth dimension , if any , plays no significant dynamical role in the solar system .",
    "we have combined our limits with data on the composition of each solar - system body to obtain constraints on ep violation by individual constituent elements , under the assumption that a single element dominates in each case .",
    "the resulting upper limits on @xmath0 for hydrogen , helium , iron , oxygen , silicon and magnesium are of order @xmath232 .",
    "there is an important statistical caveat to these results . as uncertainties in our orbital and other parameters",
    ", we have implicitly relied on residuals from published fits to a fixed number of ephemeris solution parameters .",
    "these fits do not generally incorporate a different degree of ep violation for each solar - system body .",
    "( they are typically sensitive to at most a single ep - violating parameter @xmath7 . )",
    "we have , in other words , relied on more degrees of freedom than are actually present in the solutions .",
    "this is not necessarily a problem , but will tend to underestimate our uncertainties .",
    "the results least affected will be those based on the lunar nordtvedt effect , for which at least one ep - violating term is explicitly included in the solution sets .",
    "our other results may be less robust in comparison .",
    "it would be of interest to incorporate additional independent parameters for ep violation into the standard ephemeris models .    given the uncertainties , our results should be seen as illustrative rather than definitive .",
    "they are three to seven orders of magnitude weaker than the best existing constraints on ep violation from torsion balances or lunar laser ranging .",
    "space - based free - fall experiments should produce even stronger bounds .",

    "<S> we test this idea by using observational uncertainties in the positions and motions of solar - system bodies to set upper limits on the relative difference @xmath0 between gravitational and inertial mass for each body . for suitable pairs of objects , it is possible to constrain three different linear combinations of @xmath0 using kepler s third law , the migration of stable lagrange points , and orbital polarization ( the nordtvedt effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> limits of order @xmath1 on @xmath0 for individual bodies can then be derived from planetary and lunar ephemerides , cassini observations of the saturn system , and observations of jupiter s trojan asteroids as well as recently discovered trojan companions around the earth , mars , neptune , and saturnian moons . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be combined with models for elemental abundances in each body to test for composition - dependent violations of the universality of free fall in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting limits are weaker than those from laboratory experiments , but span a larger volume in composition space . </S>"
