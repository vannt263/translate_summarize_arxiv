    "a departure from @xmath32 would indicate the presence of isoscalar backgrounds arising from mechanisms such as @xmath33 meson exchange @xcite or perturbative contributions due to transverse quark momentum @xcite .",
    "such physics backgrounds may be expected to be larger at higher @xmath13 ( due to the drop - off of the pion pole contribution ) or non - forward kinematics ( due to angular momentum conservation ) @xcite . because previous data are unseparated @xcite ,",

    "the choice of kinematics for the two experiments was based on maximizing the range in  for a value of the invariant mass @xmath8 above the resonance region , while still enabling a longitudinal - transverse separation .",
    "the value @xmath8=1.95 gev used in the first experiment is high enough to suppress most @xmath15-channel baryon resonance backgrounds , but this suppression should be even more effective at the @xmath8=2.2 gev of the second experiment . for each ,",

    "the hms tracking algorithm used here is the same as used in our earlier f@xmath45 - 2 analysis from liquid hydrogen target @xcite .",
    "the algorithm has several requirements :    * if the program reconstructed only one track , then that track was used . *",
    "if two or more tracks are reconstructed , then the track that projects to the blocks in the calorimeter measuring the energy deposit ( i.e. the cluster ) was used .",
    "the calorimeter cut used was quite loose to only eliminate `` noise '' tracks in the chambers . * in case two or more tracks hit the cluster in the calorimeter ( or neither of them ) , then additional criteria based on which hodoscope bar was hit were used to select a correct track .",
    "the above criteria ensured that the chosen track was the most likely one to have resulted from the trigger for that event and greatly reduced the number of events improperly excluded from the analysis .",
    "the fiducial tracking inefficiencies were 2 - 9% for hms rates up to 1.4 mhz .",
    "the tracking efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of events for which an actual track is found , to the ` events ' that pass through the drift chambers .",
    "this ratio is extracted from events in a fiducial area where it is extremely likely that the scintillator hits are due to particles that also traversed the chambers .",
    "the tracking efficiency depends on both the drift chamber hit efficiency and the tracking algorithm used in finding the track .    in order to accurately calculate the tracking efficiency ,",
    "tight particle identification ( pid ) requirements were applied to select a pure data sample .",
    "these requirements are stricter than those used in the regular analysis . in the hms ,",
    "the particle identification requirements used to select pions in the tracking efficiency calculation consisted of cuts on the gas cerenkov and the calorimeter for f@xmath45 - 1 data , while for f@xmath45 - 2 an additional cut on the aerogel cerenkov was applied .",
    "the fiducial tracking efficiency analysis also incorporates a cut on the integrated pulse ( adc ) from the scintillator hodoscope pmts , to exclude events with multiple hits per scintillator plane . in the case where there are multiple tracks in the same scintillator plane , this cut places a bias on the event sample used to calculate the tracking efficiency .",
    "since 2-track events have a lower efficiency than 1-track events , the resulting bias causes the hms tracking efficiency to be overestimated .    to obtain a better understanding of the hms tracking efficiencies , in f@xmath45 - 2 a study of singles yields from a carbon target versus hms rate and beam current",
    "was performed .",
    "the normalized yields from a carbon target should present no significant beam current- or rate - dependence if the various efficiencies are calculated correctly .",
    "unfortunately , no luminosity scans on carbon target were taken at different beam currents in the f@xmath45 - 1 experiment , so any conclusions obtained from the f@xmath45 - 2 study have to be applied also to the f@xmath45 - 1 data .",
    "since the probability of a second particle traversing the hms during the event resolving time is greater at high rates , a tight electron pid cut might introduce its own deadtime not due to tracking efficiency , causing the rate - dependence to be underestimated .",
    "therefore , only hms fiducial acceptance cuts were applied in this study .",
    "normalized yields from the carbon target were computed from the number of events passing cuts , the integrated beam charge , the electronic and cpu data acquisition livetimes and the hms tracking efficiency .",
    "they are plotted versus rate in fig . [",

    "the error bars include statistical uncertainties and an estimated systematic uncertainty of 0.3% added in quadrature , to take into account beam steering on the target and other sensitive effects when no pid cut is applied .",
    "data from the two kinematic settings were separately fit versus rate ( dashed red and dash - dot blue curves in the figure ) and normalized to unity at zero rate .",
    "the two data sets , thus normalized , were then fit together , yielding the solid black curve .",

    "the tracking efficiencies were assigned a 1.0% scale and an 0.4% @xmath11-uncorrelated systematic uncertainty , where the first is the scale uncertainty common to all settings , and the second is due to a variety of factors that may affect high and low @xmath11 settings differently , as evidenced by the greater scatter exhibited by the tracking efficiencies at high rates ( see refs .",

    "data at larger @xmath13 are needed to see if this interpretation is correct .",
    "photoproduction data @xcite at @xmath208  have hinted at quark - partonic behavior , based on the combination of constituent scaling , and experimental results for @xmath190 .",
    "however , the experimental photoproduction cross sections are much larger than can be accounted for by one - hard - gluon - exchange diagrams in a handbag factorization calculation , even at @xmath209  @xcite .",
    "either the vector meson dominance contribution is still large , or the leading - twist generation of the meson underestimates the handbag contribution @xcite .",
    "however , by forming the @xmath14 ratio the nonperturbative components represented by the form factors and meson distribution amplitude may be divided out , allowing the perturbative contribution to be observed more readily . in the limit that the soft contributions are completely divided out , the one - hard - gluon - exchange calculation predicts @xcite the simple scaling behavior @xmath210 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the recent jlab data at @xmath211 and above @xmath212  are in agreement with the above expression , while those at smaller @xmath159 are not @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the relatively early perturbative behavior in transverse electroproduction is that the quasi - free process @xmath213 has the minimal total number of elementary fields ( 4 ) @xcite and so requires only a single photon exchange .",
    "the fact that only a single pion is created may be crucial to this quasi - free picture , since it implies that the string tension never greatly exceeds o(@xmath214 ) .",
    "by contrast , the photoproduction reaction @xmath215 at high @xmath13 can only proceed if the initial quark is far off its mass shell .",
    "the required strong binding to other quarks leads to the larger number of active elementary fields in @xmath216 ( 9 ) and hence @xmath217 scaling .",
    "another prediction of the quark - parton mechanism @xcite is the suppression of @xmath218 due to @xmath15-channel helicity conservation .",
    "our data support this hypothesis in that  decreases more rapidly than  with increasing .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath2 electroproduction on both @xmath40h and @xmath43h , where @xmath219 at our highest , @xmath13 setting ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tttratio ] ) .",
    "the @xmath218 ratios for @xmath1 production are generally consistent with those for @xmath2 , once one takes into account the respective error bars and model - dependences .",
    "the separated cross section data are compared to a variety of models in figs .",
    "[ fig : xsec_models1 ] ,  [ fig : xsec_models2 ] , and our @xmath31 , @xmath190 and @xmath220 ratios are compared to the same models in fig .",

    "as briefly mentioned in the introduction , the vgl regge model was extended by kaskulov and mosel ( km ) @xcite and more recently by vrancx and ryckebusch ( vr ) @xcite .",
    "km add to the regge model a hadronic model , which incorporates dis @xmath7 electroproduction at the amplitude level .",
    "this dis process dominates the transverse response at moderate and high , increasing the predicted . in this approach ,",
    "the residual effects of nucleon resonances in the proton electromagnetic transition form factor are treated as dual to partons , i.e. `` resonance - parton ( r - p ) contributions '' .",
    "the vr model differs from the km model by using an alternative r - p transition form factor , which better describes the deep - inelastic @xmath222 data .",
    "the vgl model parameters used here are taken from the fits to our @xmath43h  data shown in ref .",
    "similarly , the km and vr models base their parameterization of the pion electromagnetic form factor upon fits to our @xmath43h  data .",
    "not surprisingly , the vgl and km models predict nearly identical  in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_models1 ] , while the vr values are a bit higher . for",
    ", the km and vr models are much closer to the experimental values than vgl , but they predict a steeper @xmath0-dependence than exhibited by the data .",
    "of these three models , km also provides the best description of the @xmath2  and  data .",
    "the @xmath31 predictions of the vgl , km and vr models are nearly identical at = 0.6 , 1.0 , with some differences becoming apparent at larger  and @xmath13 . with the exception of the highest @xmath13 points at = 2.45",
    ", the models generally predict @xmath31 ratios that are too large in comparison to the data .",
    "as already discussed , the reason for this discrepancy for the three  taken at @xmath195 gev is believed to be a small resonance contribution in the longitudinal channel that is not included in these models .",
    "the vgl , km and vr models also generally underpredict @xmath190 , particularly at @xmath177 .",
    "however , the km and vr models predict systematically larger @xmath190 values than vgl due to the addition of the dis mechanism to the transverse channel .",
    "in fact , the vr model comes quite close to the data at higher @xmath13 , and , validating their improvements to the r - p transition form factor , such as a softer proton dirac form factor .",
    "the maid model is a phenomenological fit to pion electroproduction data in the canonical resonance region ( @xmath223 gev ) .",
    "this model incorporates breit - wigner fits to nucleon resonances and also includes ( unitarized ) non - resonant backgrounds . originally introduced in 1998 @xcite ,",
    "maid has undergone incremental improvements .",
    "shown here are the results of the most recent version of the maid model from 2007 @xcite .",
    "for these calculations , we have used the maid07 standard parameter set , although some parameters ( such as relative strengths of resonances , the charged pion form factor , etc . ) can be adjusted . finally , note",
    "that we apply the maid model to some kinematics with @xmath224 gev . strictly speaking",
    ", the model is not constrained in this regime and the results plotted represent an extrapolation of a calculation fit at lower @xmath8 .    for , the maid07 predictions are slightly higher than the vgl , km and vr models , while the  predictions are midway between the purely regge - based vgl and the vgl+dis km and vr . in terms of @xmath14 ratios",
    ", maid07 provides by far the best description of @xmath31 , providing further evidence that the disagreement between the pion - pole dominated models and the @xmath31 data is due to small resonant contributions in the longitudinal channel .",
    "maid07 also provides a fairly good description of @xmath190 at = 1.6 , although it undershoots the @xmath190 at = 0.6 , 1.0 .",
    "the overshoot at = 2.45  is probably due to the significant extrapolation from the optimized parameter region @xmath223 gev .",
    "we further investigated the impact of resonances in the maid07 model on the @xmath14 ratios . with all resonances turned off ( born term and meson exchange contributions on ) , the model gives @xmath225 and @xmath190 far below the data ( @xmath2260.5 at = 0.6 , 1.0 , @xmath2260.2 at = 1.6 , 2.45 ) . even though the data are acquired near @xmath227 gev or higher ,",
    "turning on only the p@xmath228(1232 ) resonance has a significant effect on @xmath190 ( increasing it to @xmath2291.5 at = 0.6 , 1.0 , and @xmath2290.8 at = 1.6 , 2.45 ) , but it has only a small effect on @xmath31 . progressively turning on the other resonances yields no clear trend in the behavior of either ratio .",
    "curiously , turning off only the highest three resonances , f@xmath230(1950 ) , p@xmath231(1910 ) , f@xmath232(1905 ) , results in virtually no change from the nominal case . in summary",
    ", no clear single resonance seems to account for the global behavior of the separated ratios in the maid07 model .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to see the result if the model parameters could be optimized for higher @xmath8 .",
    "the goloskokov - kroll ( gk ) gpd - based model @xcite is a modified perturbative approach , incorporating the full pion electromagnetic form factor ( as determined by fits to our @xmath21 data @xcite ) in the longitudinal channel and the @xmath16 transversity gpd dominating the transverse channel .",
    "the gk model is in good agreement with our @xmath190 data at @xmath177 , but predicts too - flat of a @xmath0-dependence .",
    "the predictions for @xmath31 are very similar to the pion - pole dominated vgl , km and vr models .",
    "it is extremely important to keep in mind that the parameters in the gk model are optimized for small skewness ( @xmath233 ) and large @xmath234 gev , and have not been adjusted at all for the kinematics of our data .",
    "this limitation becomes apparent when comparing the gk - predicted  and  to our data in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec_models2 ] . the predicted",
    "are too large in magnitude , being entirely off the plotting scale at = 1.0 , and dropping very rapidly with @xmath13 to come close to the data for the highest @xmath13 at = 1.6 , 2.45 .",
    "the predicted  are generally similar to , but slightly smaller in magnitude than the vgl , km and vr models .",
    "all four models use our @xmath43h @xmath2 data as a constraint in one manner or other . the reasonable agreement between the gpd - based model and our data",
    "is sufficiently encouraging in our view to justify further effort to better describe the larger @xmath235 , smaller @xmath8 regime such as covered by our data .",
    "we present @xmath3/@xmath4/@xmath5/@xmath6 separated cross sections for the @xmath40h@xmath41 reactions , at = 0.6 - 1.6 , @xmath195 gev and = 2.45 , @xmath196 gev .",
    "the data were acquired with the hms+sos spectrometers in hall c of jefferson lab , with the exclusive production of a single pion assured via a missing mass cut .",
    "the separated cross sections have typical statistical uncertainties per @xmath0-bin of 5 - 10% .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainties are due to hms tracking at high rates ( @xmath1 ) , hms cerenkov blocking ( @xmath1 ) , cryotarget boiling at high current ( @xmath2 ) , spectrometer acceptance modeling , radiative corrections , pion absorption and decay .",
    "these data represent a substantial advance over previous measurements , which were either unseparated at = 0.7  @xcite , or separated but over a limited kinematic range in the resonance region @xcite .    in comparison to our previously published @xmath2 data from @xmath43h @xcite , the @xmath2 @xmath3/@xmath4 ratios from @xmath40h are higher at = 0.6 , 1.0  but fall more steeply with @xmath13 , are nearly the same as from @xmath43h at = 1.6 , and lower at = 2.45 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 longitudinal cross sections are lower than for @xmath2 at = 0.6 , 1.0 , but the drop with increasing  is less drastic and by = 2.45  the @xmath1 @xmath3/@xmath4 ratio is slightly more favorable than for @xmath2 . if this trend continues to higher , this larger @xmath3/@xmath4 ratio would benefit future planned @xmath3/@xmath4-separations of the @xmath40h@xmath47 reaction @xcite due to a smaller error magnification factor .",
    "is nearly zero for all kinematic settings , and we also observe a significant suppression of  compared to , particularly at = 2.45 .    our data for @xmath31 trend toward 0.8 at low @xmath13 , indicating the dominance of isovector processes in forward kinematics , which is consistent with our earlier findings when extracting the pion form factor from @xmath43h data at the same kinematics @xcite .",
    "although higher order corrections in the longitudinal cross section are expected to be quite large even at = 10 , these corrections may largely cancel in the ratios of longitudinal observables such as @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "since the transverse target asymmetry is difficult to separate from significant non - longitudinal contaminations at @xmath236 , @xmath31 may be the only practical ratio for constraining the polarized gpds .",
    "in addition to the longitudinal cross section , @xmath31 is one of the few realistically testable predictions of the gpd model , particularly if higher order corrections cancel at a relatively low value of  of 2.45 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath190 with @xmath13 shows a rapid fall off with apparently very little -dependence above @xmath237  within the range covered by our data .",
    "even the old photoproduction data above @xmath13=0.15  from desy @xcite follow this universal curve .",
    "the @xmath190 value at the highest @xmath13 is consistent with @xmath15-channel quark knockout .",
    "however , it is unclear if this indicates a transition from nucleon and meson degrees of freedom to quarks and gluons , as such quark - partonic behavior is at variance with theoretical expectations of large higher twist effects in exclusive measurements @xcite and the maid @xcite results suggest important soft effects .",
    "measurements at larger values of @xmath13 and  and further theoretical work are clearly needed to better understand the observed ratios .",
    "if @xmath190 is still @xmath2381/4 to @xmath5710% at higher  and similar @xmath239 , the hypothesis of a quark knockout reaction mechanism will be strengthened since there is no natural mechanism for generating @xmath190=1/4 in a regge model over a wide range of .",
    "since @xmath190 is not dominated by the pion pole term , this observable is likely to play an important role in future transverse gpd programs planned after the completion of the jlab 12 gev upgrade .",
