    "there is another way to observe a signature of the macroscopic entanglement between the loop and the bec .",
    "if we measure the distribution of the bec when it is released from the trap and correlate it with the state of the loop then it is evident from eq .",

    "[ eq:7 ] the particle density distribution should shift either from @xmath72 or from @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "therefore , the decoherence time for the loop must be larger than the time required to complete the adiabatic process so that the required entanglement can be observed .",
    "there are various factors @xcite which can limit the decoherence time of a flux loop .",
    "noise in the magnetic field , interaction of the loop with the state measuring apparatus and impurities in the substrate on which the loop is fabricated can decohere a flux superposition .",
    "at present the decoherence and relaxation times for a flux qubit of the order of 1 - 10 @xmath46s have been reported @xcite . in order to satisfy the adiabatic condition",
    "while increasing the coupling between the superconducting loop and the magnetic trap the turn on process should be slow enough to satisfy @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the angular trap frequency .",
    "if change in the trap frequency during the perturbation turn - on process is of the order of the trap frequency then the time for the adiabatic approximation to hold can be estimated roughly from the trap frequencies . since the effect of perturbation is much stronger along the axial direction ( weaker confinement ) .",
    "therefore , the inverse of axial trap frequency can give a rough estimation of the adiabatic time limit .",
    "for a typical axial trap frequency of 10  hz the adiabatic time limit estimation is about 100  ms which requires a considerable improvement in the decoherence time of the flux loop .",
    "however , an accurate calculation of the time limit for the validity of the adiabatic approximation can be calculated by numerically solving the dynamics of bec in the time dependent perturbation by minimizing the transition probability to other excited states from the instantaneous ground state of the potential .    in order to evaluate the time limit for the adiabatic approximation to hold",
    "it is important to know the functional form of the magnetic trap potential moving towards ( @xmath47-direction ) the superconducting loop which can be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 correspond to the radial trap frequencies and @xmath79 is the axial trap frequency and it is assumed that the state dependent perturbation is well defined . since the trap considered here is predominantly anisotropic ( @xmath80 ) the effect of perturbation induced by the loop is more significant along the axial direction .",
    "the term @xmath81 represents the mean perturbation along the axial direction of the magnetic trap when the loop is in @xmath3 state .",
    "when the loop exists in state @xmath2 , the sign of the perturbation is changed .",
    "the displacement of the trap towards the loop and how fast the perturbation is induced depends on @xmath82 .",
    "the trap frequency in the case of a z - wire trap is inversely proportional to the distance of the trap centre from the z - wire and the offset field at the trap centre .",
    "a variation in the trap frequency when the trap is moved towards the loop can be avoided by synchronously varying the offset field . according to the numerical calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] the perturbation amplitude is negligibly small for @xmath83 m and grows rapidly as @xmath45 is reduced . therefore a bec can be prepared at about @xmath84 and by decreasing @xmath45 to about @xmath85 m a perturbation amplitude of about 5.5 mg can be obtained . the function @xmath86 is fitted to the axial magnetic field profile shown in fig .",

    "[ eq:12 ] in order to study the dynamics of bec coupling to the superconducting loop and to numerically evaluate the time limit for the adiabatic approximation .",
    "in the context of experimental realization it is important to consider that the magnetic field from the z - wire and the bias field should be less than the critical field of the superconducting loop .",
    "the experiment can be constructed by utilizing flip - chip technology , where the z - wire and the superconducting loop can be constructed on two different substrates which can be bonded together with high precision with an appropriate gap between them .",

    "we have shown how the coherent dynamics of a superconducting loop can be used to generate a macroscopic entanglement of a bec on an atom chip .",
    "such a macroscopic entanglement could be useful to explore fundamental quantum mechanics by studying how quantum mechanical effects behave at the macroscopic level and how they decohere with the system parameters .",
