    "sub - stellar objects , including brown dwarfs , sub - brown dwarfs , and free - floating objects of planetary mass , are all at their most luminous ( by orders of magnitude ) upon formation .",
    "therefore , the nearest and youngest star - forming regions ( sfrs ) present the best opportunity to determine the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) at the lowest masses . theories of star - formation that attempt to predict imfs @xcite , require observational constraints , especially at the low mass end . specifically , one pressing open question is : what is the lowest mass object that can form via the usual star - formation process ?",
    "the advent of large - format near - infrared ( nir ) array detectors has opened the door to surveying large angular extents of nearby sfrs with sensitivity sufficient to uncover planetary mass objects .",
    "the potential now exists to determine the imf shapes of the nearest and youngest sfrs through the substellar regime down to @xmath41@xmath62 m@xmath7 .",
    "recent work on some nearby sfrs has determined imfs in a statistical sense only , by deriving luminosity functions ( lfs ) , deduced from imaging data obtained in just a single nir waveband .",
    "for example , imfs were derived from observed k - band luminosity functions ( klfs ) for the orion nebula cluster ( onc * ? ? ? * ) and ic348 @xcite or from the observed j - band luminosity function ( jlf ) for ic348 @xcite .",
    "this method for imf determination relies on : @xmath8 an assumed form of the mass function , @xmath9 an assumed age distribution , and @xmath10 pre - main - sequence model tracks which give the single filter brightness for a given mass .",
    "additional complications that arise for this ( and other ) method(s ) of imf determination include : distinguishing cluster members from non - members , accounting for the extinction to each object , and correcting for excess emission due to circumstellar material / disks to the observed klf s ( this latter effect is minimized for jlfs ) .    a summary of published imfs that make use of nir photometric data for six nearby sfrs is presented in table 1 .",
    "distances , ages , telescope / instrument combinations used , completeness limits reached , and references are listed . the potential for deriving an imf in @xmath0 oph",
    "is shown by listing the parameters of our survey in the last entry of table 1 .",
    "alternative approaches for imf determinations of sfrs , applicable to low extinction regions , include converting the observed jlf to an lf with the aid of model pre - main - sequence tracks by applying bolometric corrections ( b.c.s ) derived from field stars .",
    "pre - main - sequence tracks , for a presumed cluster age , are then used to convert the luminosity function to a mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath11 ori .",
    "this approach is aided by complementary spectroscopy , since the b.c.s are a function of spectral type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "optical multi - object spectroscopy has been used for imf determinations in relatively low - extinction regions of sfrs to derive cluster membership , extinction , and spectral types for individual candidate young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "broadband photometry is then used , in conjunction with bolometric corrections , to derive individual yso luminosities .",
    "each yso is plotted on an h - r diagram , and comparison with a set of pre - main - sequence tracks is used to derive a mass and age for each cluster member ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for taurus ; @xcite for cha i.    finally , fitting of multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) has been used to derive de - reddened effective temperatures ( t@xmath12 ) for cloud members .",
    "pre - main - sequence tracks , for an assumed cluster age , are then used to derive mass values for a given t@xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath0 oph .",
    "this approach , however , is problematic for treating ysos with circumstellar disks and/or envelopes .    related to the determination of the shape of the imf at the lowest masses is the search for a low mass cut - off of the imf .",
    "this search has been the focus of many recent investigations . we list those making use of deep , nir imaging in table 2 . in the ic348 cluster ,",
    "one new candidate planetary mass object ( pmo ) has been proposed but awaits spectroscopic confirmation @xcite .",
    "the most recent deep , large - area , nir study of the onc , covered a 30@xmath13 region to @xmath14 19.5 mag , @xmath15 mag , and @xmath16 mag ( 3@xmath11 ) , a sensitivity sufficient to detect 1 myr old pmo s to @xmath17 mag of extinction @xcite .",
    "these authors found 1298 sources in the reddened brown dwarf region and 142 in the reddened pmo region of the @xmath18 vs. @xmath19 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the source distribution in the corresponding regions of the @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 color - magnitude diagram yielded 2134 sources in the reddened brown dwarf region and 421 sources in the reddened pmo region . in ngc1333 , no pmo s",
    "have been found , but 19 spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs have , from a sample of 36 objects with @xmath22 colors expected for young , very low mass objects @xcite .",
    "this , despite the sensitivity of the survey to mass limits of 0.008 m@xmath23 for @xmath24 mag and 0.00 4m@xmath23 for @xmath25 mag , led the authors to the conjecture that the low - mass cut - off corresponding to t@xmath26 2500 k has been found for this cluster .",

    "the more recent study placed upper limits on the number of missing planetary mass members ( down to @xmath4 0.008 m@xmath23 ) of @xmath28 3% ( @xmath28 7 ) of the currently known yso population in chamaeleon i. due to its large angular extent , searches for pmo s in the taurus sfr have been targeted towards known members , be they young stellar objects ( ysos ) or young brown dwarfs .",

    "a careful re - analysis of archival data , supplemented by newer large - area , sensitive imaging , led to the discovery of three new planetary mass candidates down to @xmath4 4 @xmath30 , bringing to 17 the total number of candidate pmo s in this region @xcite . in the recent deep nir imaging study of lupus iii , no planetary mass objects ( corresponding to late t spectral types ) , but 17 sub - stellar candidates ( with 1700k @xmath28 t@xmath12 @xmath28",

    "furthermore , these same authors identified 27 brown dwarf candidates ( 11 of which have previous spectroscopic confirmation ) using _ spitzer _ photometry .",
    "analysis of the 2mass calibration strip , running along a 9@xmath37 wide swath through the @xmath0 oph core , resulted in the identification of 11 possible planetary mass objects ( t @xmath28 1800k ) of @xmath4 115 cluster - member candidates ( marsh et al .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of seven of these resulted in the discovery of a single planetary mass object @xcite .",
    "an alternate approach that has been used to search for the lowest mass member of the @xmath0 oph core is to target the spectroscopic signature of methane ( ch@xmath38 ) absorption , found in low - temperature ( t@xmath391500 k ) atmospheres .",
    "images are acquired through specially designed adjacent narrow - band methane - off ( @xmath41.6@xmath40 m ) and methane - on ( @xmath41.7@xmath40 m ) filters covering the @xmath18-band .",

    "observations of the @xmath0 ophiuchi cloud core were obtained during the period 2008 may 23 - 26 with the iris2 nir imager / spectrograph on the australian astronomical observatory s 4 m telescope ( aat ) .",
    "iris2 consists of a hawaii hgcdte 1024@xmath331024 array which , when mounted at the f/8 cassegrain focus on the aat , yields a plate scale of 045 pixel@xmath45 with a corresponding field of view of approximately 7.7@xmath46@xmath337.7@xmath46 .",

    "details of our observation and data reduction procedures for all filters are discussed in @xcite . however , because this paper makes extensive use of the @xmath42 and @xmath50 data , which the previous work did not , we summarize below the observations and image reduction process for these filters .",
    "nineteen iris2 fields , centered at @xmath51 = 16@xmath5226@xmath5356.34@xmath54 , @xmath55 = -24@xmath5628@xmath465222 ( j2000 ) , were observed in a rectangular pattern covering an area of @xmath4 920 arcmin@xmath57 on the sky .",
    "the observed area is shown by the solid outlines in figure 1 , superposed on the extinction map that was derived from the 2mass catalog as part of the complete project @xcite using the nicer algorithm @xcite . each field",
    "was spatially overlapped by 1 arcminute in both right ascension and declination to allow for redundancy of photometric measurements of sources located in the overlapped regions .",
    "all fields were observed in the mauna kea observatory ( mko ) photometric system @xmath42 and @xmath50 filters in a five point dither pattern with 30offsets between each dither .",
    "integration times at each dither position for the @xmath42 and @xmath50 filters were 15 seconds @xmath33 4 coadds and 6 seconds @xmath33 10 coadds , respectively , for a total integration time of 5 minutes in each filter .",
    "the fwhm for all observations varied between approximately 2.2 - 3.1 pixels ( @xmath4 10 - 14 ) , with the worst seeing being at the shortest wavelengths ( _ e.g_. , the @xmath42 filter ) .",
    "all data were reduced using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "an average dark frame was constructed from the dark frames taken at the beginning and end of each night s observations .",
    "this dark frame was subtracted from all target observations to yield dark subtracted images .",
    "sky frames in each filter were individually made for each observation by median - combining all five @xmath42 and @xmath50 band frames for each field .",
    "the individual sky frames were normalized to produce flat fields for each target frame .",
    "all target frames were processed by subtracting the appropriate sky frames and dividing by the flat fields .",
    "target frames were then registered and combined to produce the final reduced images in each filter .",
    "@xmath18-band images of each field were constructed by adding the corresponding ch@xmath48 and ch@xmath49 images for the particular field in question .",
    "infrared sources were identified at @xmath50-band using the automated source extractor daofind routine within iraf @xcite .",
    "daofind was run on each field using a fwhm of 2.8 pixels , and a single pixel finding threshold equal to 3 times the mean noise of each image .",
    "each field was individually inspected , and the daofind coordinate files were edited to remove bad pixels and any objects misidentified as stars , as well as to add any missed stars to the list .",
    "objects within 30of the field edges were also removed from the list , as they were in low signal to noise regions of the image as a result of the dither pattern used .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed on all fields in each filter using the phot routine within iraf .",
    "an aperture of 4 pixels in radius was used for all target photometry , and a 10 pixel radius was used for the standard star photometry .",
    "sky values around each source were determined from the mode of intensities in an annulus with inner and outer radii of 10 and 20 pixels , respectively .",
    "our choice of aperture size for our target photometry insured that the individual source fluxes were not contaminated by the flux from neighboring stars ; however , they are not large enough to include all the flux from a given source . in order to account for this missing flux",
    ", aperture corrections were determined using the mkapfile routine within iraf .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes for all sources were corrected to account for the missing flux .",
    "photometric calibration was accomplished using the list of standard stars of @xcite .",
    "the standards were observed on the same nights and through the same range of air masses as the @xmath0 ophiuchi cloud .",
    "zero points and extinction coefficients were established for each night .",
    "all magnitudes and colors were transformed to the cit system using mko to 2mass and 2mass to cit photometric color transformation equations , and the conversion relations of @xcite .",
    "because of the extensive spatial overlapping of the cloud images , a number of sources were observed at least twice .",
    "we compared the @xmath58 , magnitudes of 200 duplicate stars identified in the overlap regions .",
    "for all stars brighter than the completeness limit of our survey , the photometry of the duplicate stars agreed to within 0.15 magnitudes .",
    "plots of our photometric errors as a function of magnitude are presented in figure 2 , for @xmath42 ( left panel ) , @xmath18 ( middle panel ) , and @xmath20 ( right panel ) .",
    "the completeness limit of our observations was determined by adding artificial stars at random positions to each of the 19 fields in all four filters and counting the number of sources recovered by daofind .",
    "artificial stars were added in twelve separate half - magnitude bins , covering a magnitude range of 16.00 to 22.00 , with each bin containing 100 stars .",
    "the artificial stars were examined to ensure that they had the same fwhm as the real sources in each image .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on all sources to confirm that the assigned magnitudes of the added sources agreed with those returned by phot .",
    "all photometry agreed to within 0.10 mag .",
    "daofind and phot were then run and the number of identified artificial sources within each half - magnitude bin was tallied .",
    "this process was repeated 20 times .",
    "we estimate that our survey is 90% complete to @xmath42 = 20.00 , @xmath18 = 20.00 , and @xmath50 = 18.50 .",
    "furthermore , saturation of objects in each image occurred at j @xmath59 12.0 , h @xmath59 11.0 , and k@xmath60 @xmath59 10.0 , respectively .",
    "thus our observations are sensitive to 12.0 @xmath61 20.0 , 11.0 @xmath62 20.0 , and 10.0 @xmath63 18.5 , respectively .",
    "coordinates for all objects were determined relative to the positions of known objects in the 2mass catalog . in particular , plate solutions",
    "were done using the 2mass catalog in conjunction with wcstools , a package of programs and a library of utility subroutines for setting and using the world coordinate system in the headers of the most common astronomical image formats to relate image pixels to sky coordinates .",
    "the resulting coordinates of all objects in our survey have typical rms uncertainties of @xmath4 020 relative to the coordinates of previously known stars used in their determinations .",
    "we detected a total of 2283 sources at all three wavelengths at or brighter than our @xmath58 completeness limits within the 920 arcmin@xmath32 region outlined by the solid black lines in figure 1 .",
    "of course , many more sources were detected at each individual waveband . at @xmath20 , we detected 7081 sources to 5@xmath11 , and 6882 to our @xmath64 completeness limit .",
    "we used the locations of the @xmath20 detections to search for counterparts at @xmath18 and @xmath42 . since we used the combination of the 30-min . on - source duration observations in the methane - on and methane - off filters to construct the @xmath18-band image , instead of just the 5 minutes total on - source integration times at @xmath20 and @xmath42-bands , we detected 7090 sources at @xmath18 to 5@xmath11 , and 6986 to our @xmath2 completeness limit .",
    "finally , we detected just 3486 sources to 5@xmath11 at @xmath42 , and 2404 to our @xmath65 completeness limit , reflecting the fact that we were observing through the highest extinction portions of the @xmath0 oph core .",
    "our survey boundaries are indicated in figure 1 , superposed on the extinction map ( described in @xmath44 2 ) , displayed in both greyscale and by contour levels . from figure 1 , it is evident that our survey encompassed the highest extinction portions of the @xmath0 oph cloud core .",
    "the vast majority of detected sources lie between the @xmath66 and @xmath67 contour levels , whereas much of the surveyed area has @xmath68 .    in figure 3 (",
    "left panel ) , we present the @xmath69 color - color diagram for all 2283 objects with 10 @xmath70 18.5 in our survey area , with available photometry at all three ( @xmath43 ) bands in our data . the greatest uncertainty in the colors is less than 0.2 magnitudes for all sources and is indicated by the size of the cross in each panel of figure 3 .",
    "the solid curve in each panel represents the locus of colors corresponding to unreddened main sequence stars , ranging in spectral type from early o to m9 , after converting the 2mass colors to the cit system .",
    "the locus of the colors of giant stars is represented by a dashed line in each panel @xcite .",
    "the two parallel dashed lines define the reddening band for main sequence stars and are parallel to the reddening vector .",
    "the classical t tauri star ( ctts ) locus in these diagrams extends from @xmath71 = 0.81 , @xmath72 = 0.50 to @xmath71 = 1.10 , @xmath73 = 1.00 ( meyer , calvet , & hillenbrand 1997 ) .",
    "a diagonal arrow representing the effect of 5 magnitudes of visual extinction is also shown .",
    "the reddening law of @xcite , derived in the cit system and having a slope of 1.692 , has been adopted .",
    "note the offset of the detected sources in the left panel of figure 3 from the ( 0,0 ) position in the color - color diagram , indicating all sources suffer _ at least _",
    "@xmath74 5 mag of visual extinction  confirming that we are looking through the darkest portion of the @xmath0 oph cloud core .",
    "of the 2283 stars plotted in the left panel of figure 3 , 1139 de - redden to the ctts locus .",

    "we plot the locations assigned by our sed - fitting program to known , spectroscopically confirmed , brown dwarfs in @xmath0 oph from the tabulation of @xcite . in figure 4 ,",
    "the open diamonds represent known brown dwarfs with ir excesses ( top panel ) and known brown dwarfs without ir excesses ( middle panel ) . in both cases , our fitting would independently determine these objects to lie above the main - sequence , and to have low values of @xmath75 .",
    "the identification of the new candidate cloud members in @xmath0 oph is primarily based on their location in the plots of figure 4 .",
    "the top panel of figure 4 shows a dramatically different distribution of sources from those in the middle and bottom panels .",

    "the open diamonds plotted in the top panel of figure 4 represent fits to the photometry of previously known and spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarf members of the cluster that also display infrared excess emission from disks , for comparison .",
    "an artifact in the top panel of figure 4 is the presence of a gap in the distribution of @xmath75 values from the model fits in the 1200 k @xmath80 1800 k range .",
    "the root cause of this gap is that objects surrounded by circumstellar material , and , therefore , exhibiting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) characteristic of disks or late - stage protostars , were fit to purely photospheric models ( cond , dusty , nextgen , blackbody ) . at the lowest temperatures ( @xmath811500 k ) ,",
    "the cond models tend to give fairly flat - looking seds which often provide artificially good fits to flat spectrum protostars , while the more evolved young stellar objects are better fit by higher - temperature models which are more planck - like ( dusty , nextgen , blackbody ) .",
    "it can be seen from the top panel of figure 4 that the distinct gap in the distribution of sources in the 1200 k @xmath821800 k range is not an artifact of the 1500 k boundary between the cond and dusty models  rather , this gap represents the temperature range over which none of the photospheric models can adequately mimic circumstellar disks .",
    "a substantial fraction of the newly discovered population of `` excess '' sources plotted in the top panel of figure 4 seems concentrated above the lowest @xmath75 nextgen models , but below the cond / dusty models .",
    "this is very likely due to suppressed k - band flux due to extinction of the yso photospheres by cool disk material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the middle panel of figure 4 , we plot the 527 `` non - excess '' sources for which successful sed fits were obtained to our combined @xmath43 and available _ spitzer _ photometry . among these `` non - excess '' sources ,",
    "most ( 343/527 ) lie in the region below the main - sequence at the cloud s distance in the de - reddened @xmath20 vs. @xmath75 plot .",
    "therefore , most of the non - excess sources are consistent with being background objects .",
    "however , 184 of the 527 non - excess sources plotted in the middle panel of figure 4 lie above the main - sequence , and are candidate cloud members .",
    "the open diamonds plotted in the middle panel of figure 4 show the locations of fits to the photometry of previously known , spectroscopically confirmed , brown dwarf members of the cluster , that lack infrared excess emission .",

    ", it is not appropriate to scale by the relative areas of the two regions .",
    "rather , the scaling must be based on the number density ratio of extragalactic sources to background stars , which is the same for the  cloud \" and  exterior \" regions .",
    "multiplying our cloud : exterior background source count ratio ( 1.05 ) by the exterior : cloud pms source ratio ( 63/948 ) , we find an upper limit to the percentage of contaminating sources among our candidate members of @xmath4 7% .",
    "thus , 66 of our 948 candidate ysos could be extragalactic background objects .",
    "an alternative approach to estimating background contamination by extragalactic sources may be derived by inspection of figure 6 , in which we plot the @xmath92 colors of galaxies in the goods ( great observatories origins deep survey)-south field imaged with vlt - isaac , after transforming the @xmath19 and @xmath21 colors to the cit system .",

    "increasing the extinction has the dual effect of reddening and dimming these sources , such that only 42 galaxies and 22 galaxies , respectively , would be detected to our completion limits seen through @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "more importantly , the general population of background galaxies at these faint nir magnitudes have very blue colors , so that they would not contaminate the `` excess '' region of the @xmath43 color - color plot .      red giants and faint red dwarfs",
    "are expected to be the major source of galactic contaminants to our sample of candidate new , low - mass members of the @xmath0 oph yso population .",
