    "the quantum behaviour of a small system coupled to a large one has been the subject of many studies since quantum theory was first formulated . the small system is usually of primary interest and generally microscopic ( atom , nucleus , molecule or small collections of these ) but currently systems of a more macroscopic nature ( bose condensate , superconductor , quantum computer ) are being studied .",
    "the large system is invariably macroscopic in nature ( free space or universe modes of the em field , lattice modes in a solid , collider atoms in a gas ) and is of less interest in its own right , being primarily of relevance as a reservoir or bath affecting the small system in terms of relaxation and noise processes .",
    "the large system is often a model for the entire external environment surrounding the small system .",
    "changes in the small system states ( described in terms of its density operator ) can be divided into two sorts  effects on the state populations ( energy loss or gain ) or effects on the state coherences ( decoherence or induced coherence ) .",
    "equivalently , quantum information ( described via the von neumann entropy ) would be lost or gained due to the interaction with the environment , and its loss is generally associated with decoherence .",
    "interestingly , as the small system becomes larger or occupies states that are more classical the time scale for decoherence can become much smaller than that for energy loss .",
    "this is of special interest in quantum information processing @xcite where the small system is a collection of qbits making up a quantum computer weakly coupled to the outside world , or in measurement theory @xcite , where the small system is a micro system being measured coupled to an apparatus ( or pointer ) that registers the results . for quantum computers it is desirable that decoherence is negligible during the overall computation time @xcite ( otherwise error correction methods have to be incorporated , and this is costly in terms of processing time ) , whereas in measurement theory environment induced decoherence @xcite is responsible for the density operator becoming diagonal in the pointer basis ( otherwise a macroscopic superposition of pointer readings would result ) .",
    "a standard method for describing the reservoir effects on the small system is based on the born - markoff master equation for the system density operator @xcite .",
    "this depends on the correlation time for the reservoir ( as determined from the behaviour of two time correlation functions for pairs of reservoir operators involved in the system reservoir interaction ) being very short compared to that of the relaxation and noise processes of the system . in general terms , the more slowly varying the coupling constants for this interaction or the density of reservoir states are with reservoir frequencies , the shorter the correlation time will be . for many situations in the fields of quantum optics , nmr , solid state physics the born - markoff master equation provided an accurate description of the physics for the system . elaborations or variants of the method such as quantum state trajectories",
    "@xcite , fokker - planck or c - number langevin equations @xcite , quantum langevin equations @xcite are also used .",
    "sometimes an apparently non - markovian problem can be converted to a markovian one by a more suitable treatment of the internal system interactions ( for example , the use of dressed atom states @xcite for treating driven atoms in narrow band squeezed vacuum fields @xcite ) .",
    "situations are now being studied in which the standard born - markoff approach is no longer appropriate , since the reservoir correlation times are too long for the time scales of interest .",
    "a structured rather than flat reservoir situation applies @xcite .",
    "this includes cases where the reservoir coupling constants vary significantly with frequency , such as the interaction of atom(s ) or quantum dots with light in high q cavities @xcite , including microcavities ( see , for example , @xcite ) and microspheres ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "cases such as an atom ( or many atoms  super - radiance ) interacting with light in photonic band gap materials @xcite,@xcite , where the reservoir mode densities that have gaps and non - analytic behaviour near the band gap edges , also occur . also , quantum feedback situations @xcite can involve significant time delays in the feedback circuit , and thus result in non - markovian dynamics for the system itself .",
    "furthermore , systems with several degrees of freedom , such as in quantum measurements ( for example , the stern - gerlach experiment ) could involve situations where the decoherence times associated with some degrees of freedom ( such as the position of the atomic spin ) could become so short that the markoff condition might no longer be valid , and the effects of such non - markovian relaxation on the decoherence times associated with more important degrees of freedom ( atom spin states ) would be of interest .",
    "a number of methods for treating non - markovian processes have been developed .",
    "apart from direct numerical simulations @xcite , these include the zwanzig - nakajima non - markovian master equation and its extensions @xcite , the time - convolutionless projection operator master equation @xcite , heisenberg equations of motion @xcite , stochastic wave function methods for non - markovian processes @xcite , methods based on the essential states approximation or resolvent operators @xcite , the pseudo mode approach @xcite , fano diagonalisation @xcite and the sudden decoherence approximation @xcite .",
    "of these methods the last four are easier to apply and give more physical insight into what is happening .",
    "however the essential states method is difficult to apply in all but the simplest situations , since the set of coupled amplitude equations becomes unwieldy and it is difficult to solve  as in the case where multiple excitations of the reservoir are involved .",
    "the pseudo mode approach is based on the idea of enlarging the system to include part of the reservoir ( the pseudo mode  which could be bosonic or fermionic depending on the case ) thereby forming a bigger system in which the markoff approximation now applies when the coupling to the remainder of the reservoir is treated . at present the pseudomode method",
    "is also restricted to single reservoir excitation cases .",
    "the fano diagonalisation method relates the causes of non - markovian effects to various underlying features ( such as the presence of bound states for treating atom lasers ) , and is closely related to the pseudo mode method .",
    "the sudden decoherence method enables decoherence effects on time scales short compared to system bohr periods to be treated simply via ignoring the system hamiltonian .",
    "this paper deals with the relationship between the current pseudo mode method for single quantum reservoir excitations and the fano diagonalisation method for situations where the reservoir structure is due to the presence of a discrete , system of ( quasi ) modes which are coupled to other continuum ( quasi ) modes .",
    "this important case applies to atomic systems coupled to the quantum em  field in high q resonant cavities , such as microspheres or microcavities .",
    "it is shown that the pseudo mode method for single quantum excitations of the structured reservoir can be obtained by applying the fano diagonalisation method to a system featuring a set of discrete quasi modes @xcite together with a set of continuum quasi modes , whose mode density is slowly varying .",
    "the structured reservoir of true modes @xcite is thus replaced by the quasi modes .",
    "the interaction between the discrete and continuum quasi modes is treated in the rotating - wave approximation and assuming slowly varying coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the atomic system is assumed to be only coupled to the discrete quasi modes . the density of continuum quasi modes is explicitly included in the model . although the behavior of the atomic system itself is non - markovian , the enlarged system obtained by combining the discrete quasi modes with the atomic system now exhibits markovian dynamics .",
    "the discrete quasi modes are identified as pseudo modes . the continuum quasi modes are identified as the flat reservoir to which the enlarged markovian system is coupled .",
    "explicit expressions for the atom - true modes coupling constants are obtained , exhibiting the rapidly varying frequency dependence characteristic of structured reservoirs . at present the treatment",
    "is restricted to cases where threshold and band gap effects are unimportant , but may be applicable to two - dimensional photonic band gap materials .",
    "however , the problem of treating multiple excitation processes for certain types of structured reservoirs can now be treated via the quasimode theory , since the markovian master equation for the atom - quasi mode system applies for cases involving multilevel atoms or cases of several excited two - level atoms .",
    "further extensions of the treatment to allow for atomic systems driven by single mode external laser fields are also possible , with the original atomic system being replaced by the dressed atom .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ spseudo ]",
    "the key features of pseudo mode theory are outlined .",
    "section [ sfano ] presents the fano diagonalisation theory for the quasi mode system , with details covered in the appendices [ app . atomic ham ] , [ app.scaling ] and [ h = adaga ] . in section [ sresults ] specific cases such as one or two discrete quasi modes or where the variation of discrete - continuum coupling constants can be ignored are examined , giving results for the atom - true mode coupling constants and reservoir structure functions in these situations .",
    "section [ smarkov ] contains the markovian master equation for the atom plus discrete quasi modes system .",
    "section [ svarying ]  briefly examines the situation where coupling constants and mode densities are not slowly varying .",
    "conclusions and comments are set out in section [ sconc ] .",
    "the simplest case to which pseudomode theory @xcite can be applied is that of a two - level atom coupled to the modes of the quantum electromagnetic ( em ) field  which constitutes the structured reservoir .",
    "only one photon excitation processes will occur .",
    "however , the formalism would also apply to any spin 1/2 fermion system coupled to a bath of bosonic oscillators .",
    "the hamiltonian is given in the rotating wave approximation by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the usual atomic spin operators , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the annihilation , creation operators for the mode @xmath4 of the field , @xmath5 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath6 is the mode frequency and @xmath7 are the coupling constants .",
    "this system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure 1 ] .    to describe a one photon excitation process",
    ", the initial condition is the atom excited and no photons present in the field .",
    "hence the initial schrodinger picture state vector is : @xmath8    in the essential states approach the state vector at later time @xmath9 will be a superposition of the initial state and states with the atom in its lower state and one photon in various modes @xmath4 . with @xmath10 defining the complex amplitudes for the atomic excited state and the one photon states ,",
    "the state vector is : @xmath11    substitution into the time dependent schrodinger equation leads to the following coupled complex amplitude equations : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are detunings .    formally eliminating the amplitudes for the one photon states",

    "this is : @xmath14 and involves a kernel @xmath15 given by @xmath16 the mode density @xmath17 is introduced after replacing the sum over @xmath4 by an integral over the mode angular frequency @xmath18 .",
    "it is apparent from eq.([integrode ] ) that the behaviour of the atomic system only depends on the reservoir structure function @xmath19 for this single quantum excitation case defined by @xmath20 where a transition strength @xmath21 is introduced to normalise @xmath22 so that its integral gives @xmath23 . the transition strength @xmath21",
    "is given by : @xmath24 the reservoir structure function @xmath25 enables us to describe the various types of reservoir to which the atomic system is coupled .",
    "if @xmath22 is slowly varying as a function of @xmath6 then the reservoir is ` flat ' , whilst ` structured ' reservoirs are where @xmath22 varies more rapidly , as seen in figure [ figure 1 ] .",
    "there are of course two factors involved in determining the behaviour of @xmath22the mode density @xmath26 and the coupling constant via @xmath27 . either or",
    "both can determine how structured the reservoir is .",
    "photonic band gap materials are characterised by mode densities which are actually zero over the gaps in the allowed mode frequencies , and which have non analytic behaviours near the edges of the band gaps .",
    "all mode densities are zero for negative @xmath6 , so threshold effects are possible . in cavity qed situations , such as for microspheres and other high q cavities ,",
    "the coupling constant varies significantly near the cavity resonant frequencies , so in these cases it is the coupling constant that gives structure to the reservoir . for the present",
    "it will be assumed that ( apart from simple poles ) @xmath22 is analytic in the lower half complex @xmath28 plane , and any other non analytic features can be disregarded .",
    "it is recognized of course that this restriction places a limit on the range of applicability of the theory , though it may be possible to extend this range by representing the actual function @xmath25 in an approximate form that satisfies the analyticity requirements .",
    "in addition ( in order to calculate the contour integrals ) it will be assumed that @xmath22 tends to zero at least as fast as @xmath29 as @xmath30 tends to infinity .",
    "based on the above assumption regarding the reservoir structure function @xmath22 , the kernel @xmath31 may be evaluated in terms of the poles and residues of @xmath32 in the lower half complex @xmath6 plane .",
    "it is assumed that these simple poles can be enumerated .",
    "the poles are located at @xmath33 and their residues are @xmath34",
    ". the pole @xmath35 may be expressed in terms of a real angular frequency @xmath36 and a width factor @xmath37 via @xmath38 .",
    "contour integration methods show that the sum of the residues equals @xmath39 .",
    "the kernel is obtained in the form : @xmath40    the integro - differential equation ( [ integrode ] ) for the excited atomic amplitude involves a convolution integral on the right hand side and may be solved using laplace transform methods .",
    "the atomic behaviour obtained is well known @xcite and will not be rederived here .",
    "it is found that there are two regimes , depending on the ratio of the transition strength to typical width factors .",
    "these are : ( a ) a strong coupling regime with non - markovian atomic dynamics , and occuring when @xmath41 ( b ) a weak coupling regime with markovian atomic dynamics , occuring when @xmath42 .",
    "the pseudomode approach continues by considering poles of the reservoir structure function @xmath25 in the lower half complex @xmath28 plane .",
    "each pole will be associated with one pseudomode .",
    "reverting to schrodinger picture amplitudes via @xmath43 etc .",

    "the important point is that the atom plus pseudomodes system now satisfies markovian equations ( eq.([pseudoeqns ] ) ) . with a finite ( or countable ) set of pseudomodes ,",
    "the original atom plus structured continuum has now been replaced by a simpler system which still enables an exact description of the atomic behaviour to be obtained .",
    "_ exact _ master equations involving the pseudomodes have been derived , and in general the pseudomodes can be coupled ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are however , difficulties in cases where the pseudomode coupling constants are not real , which can occur in certain cases where there are several pseudomodes . apart from the general difficulty associated with situations where ( apart from having simple poles ) the reservoir structure function @xmath22 is not analytic in the lower half complex plane , there is also considerable difficulty in extending the above theory to treat cases where multiple excitations of the structured reservoir occur , such as when the two - level atom is replaced by a three - level atom in a cascade configuration with the atom is initially in the topmost state .",
    "the problem is that applying the usual essential states approach leads to two ( or more ) photon states now appearing in the state vector ( cf .",
    "eq.([essentstate ] ) ) , and the resulting coupled amplitude equations ( cf .",
    "eq.([coupampeqns ] ) ) do not apear to facilitate the sucessive formal elimination of the one , two , .. photon amplitudes , as is possible in the single photon excitation case treated above .",
    "it is therefore not clear how pseudomode amplitudes can be introduced , along the lines of eq.([pseudoamp ] ) so the pseudomode method has not yet been generalised from its original formulation to allow for multiple reservoir excitations .",
    "the case of multiple excitation of a structured reservoir involves systems more complex than the two level atom treated above",
    ". it will be sufficient for the purpose of linking the pseudomode and fano diagonalisation methods to consider single multilevel atomic systems , although multiatom systems would also be suitable as both systems could result in multiphoton excitations of the quantum em field .",

    "this important case applies to atomic systems coupled to the quantum em  field in high q resonant cavities , such as microspheres or microcavities .",
    "the fano diagonalisation method is then based around the idea that the structured reservoir of quantum em  field modes can be described in two different ways , which will now be outlined.figure [ figure 2 ] illustrates these two descriptions , along with that involving pseudo modes .",

    "for example , the quantum em  field in high q resonant cavities can be accurately described in terms of the quasi mode model which has these features , the discrete quasi modes being the cavity quasi modes ( linked to the cavity resonances ) with which the atoms inside the cavity interact , and the continuum quasi modes being the external modes .",
    "as pointed out previously , the structured reservoir can be any set of bosonic oscillators , not just the quantum em  field .",
    "the above treatment would thus apply more generally , and we would then refer to discrete quasi oscillators , continuum quasi oscillators or true oscillators . the physical basis for a quasi mode description of the reservoir of bosonic oscillators will depend on the particular situation ; in general they will be idealised approximate versions of the true modes .",

    "we will follow the lines of ref.@xcite ( section 6.6 on dressed operators ) , rather than ref.@xcite , but note that a new feature here is the presence of the mode - mode coupling term in the hamiltonian eq.([quasifieldham ] ) .",

    "also , for the non slowly varying @xmath185 or @xmath148 case , we can no longer link each discrete quasi mode to a pseudo mode . that this is the situation may be seen both from the general result for the reservoir structure function ( eq.([reservfn6 ] ) ) or the specific result we have obtained for the case where there is a single discrete quasi mode ( eq.([reservfn10 ] ) ) . in the former case ,",
    "the function @xmath171 would not be a polynomial of degree @xmath177 , and therefore could have more than @xmath177 roots , leading to more pseudo modes than discrete quasi modes . in the latter case involving just one discrete quasi mode , even having the mode density",
    "@xmath331 ( and hence @xmath332 ) represented by a single peaked function would result in @xmath333 going from a single peaked function to a triple peaked function , corresponding to three pseudo modes .    however , where @xmath185 or @xmath148 are no longer slowly varying , an examination of the underlying causes for this variation may suggest replacing the present atom plus discrete and continuum quasi mode model by a more elaborate system that better represents the physics of the situation , but with only slowly varying parameters now involved .",
    "fano diagonalisation based on such a more elaborate model could produce the desired link up with the pseudo mode approach and enable a suitable , enlarged system to be identified which has markovian behaviour , as well as overcoming the problem of treating multiple reservoir excitations .",
    "one possible elaboration would be to add a further continuum of quasi modes that are fermionic rather than bosonic .",
    "the theory presented above is mainly intended to apply to the important situation where the reservoir structure is actually due to the presence of a discrete system of quasi modes which are coupled to other continuum quasi modes via slowly varying coupling constants .",
    "for example , the quantum emfield in high q resonant cavities can be accurately described in terms of the quasi mode model which has these features , the discrete quasi modes being the cavity quasi modes ( linked to the cavity resonances ) with which the atoms inside the cavity interact , and the continuum quasi modes being the external modes .",
    "for this situation it has been shown that , for the present case of single quantum excitations , the pseudo mode method for treating atomic systems coupled to a structured reservoir of true quantum em field modes can be obtained by applying the fano diagonalisation method to the field described in an equivalent way as a set of discrete quasi modes together with a set of continuum quasi modes , whose mode density is assumed to be slowly varying .",
    "the interaction between the discrete and continuum quasi modes is treated in the rotating - wave approximation assuming slowly varying coupling constants , and the atomic system is assumed to be only coupled to the discrete quasi modes .",
    "the theory includes the true and continuum quasi mode densities explicitly .",
    "expressions for the quasi mode operators @xmath62 and @xmath84 in terms of the true mode operators @xmath83 ( and vice versa ) have been found , and explicit forms for the atom - true mode coupling constants have been obtained and related to the reservoir structure function that applies in pseudomode theory .",
    "we have seen that the feature that leads to a pseudomode is the presence of a discrete quasi mode .",
    "each discrete quasi mode corresponds to one of the pseudomodes , whose position @xmath334 in the lower half complex plane is determined from the roots @xmath237 of a polynomial equation depending on the parameters for the quasi mode system .",
    "although the behavior of the atom itself is non - markovian , an enlarged system consisting of the atom plus the discrete quasi modes coupled to a flat reservoir consisting of the continuum quasi modes exhibits markovian dynamics , and the master equation for this enlarged system has been obtained . using the quasimode theory , processes involving multiphoton excitation of",
    "the structured reservoir ( such as may occur for excited multilevel atoms ) can now be studied using standard master equation methods applied to the atom - discrete quasi modes system .",
    "furthermore , cases with unusual forms of the reservoir structure function for single quantum excitation ( for example , containing lorentzians with negative weights ) still result in markovian master equations . since for single quantum excitation",
    "the pseudomodes are equivalent to discrete quasi modes , we can now always obtain markovian master equations for pseudomode - atom systems via our approach .",
    "although not so useful in such cases , the present theory does lead to general expressions for the true mode coupling constant and the reservoir structure function for single quantum excitation .",
    "these expressions are still valid for the general case where the quasi mode density @xmath185 and the coupling constants @xmath148 are no longer slowly varying functions of @xmath66",
    ". however , the master equation for the atom plus discrete quasi modes system will no longer be markovian , so the enlargement of the system based on adding the discrete quasi modes to produce a markovian system fails . also , for the non slowly varying @xmath185 or @xmath148 case , we can no longer link each discrete quasi mode to a pseudo mode  there may be more pseudo modes than discrete quasi modes .",
    "in such cases it would be desirable to replace the present quasi mode system by a more elaborate quasi mode system involving only slowly varying quantities , and which better represents the underlying physical causes of the variation in @xmath148 and @xmath185 that occurs in the present model .",
    "this may make possible an extension of the fano diagonalisation approach that still links quasi modes with pseudo modes , and results in a markovian master equation for the enlarged atom plus quasi mode system .",
    "in such an elaborated system , the disadvantage of the present pseudo mode treatment in treating multiple excitations of the structured reservoir could still be removed .",
    "the treatment has been outlined in the case of a multilevel atom coupled to a structured reservoir of quantum em  field modes , but a similar approach would apply for any fermionic system coupled to a structured reservoir of bosonic oscillators . extensions to fermionic reservoirs should be possible also . at present the treatment",
    "is restricted to cases where threshold and band gap effects are unimportant , but may be applicable to two - dimensional photonic band gap materials .",
    "further extensions of the treatment to allow for atomic systems driven by single mode external laser fields are also possible , with the original atomic system being replaced by the dressed atom .",

    "as an example of writing the atomic hamiltonian in the form given in eq.([atomham ] ) , consider a three level atom in a v configuration with upper states@xmath335 and lower state @xmath336 , whose energy is chosen for convenience to be zero .",

    "the form given in eq.([atomham ] ) is :    @xmath342    this expression may also be written in the form    @xmath343    since by equating the coefficients of the three projection operators , we obtain a set of linear equations for the @xmath344 and @xmath80 which are solvable @xmath345 in fact the solutions are not even unique .",
