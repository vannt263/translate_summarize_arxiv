    "<S> we analyze the possible quantum correlations between two coupled dimer systems in the presence of independent losses and driven by a fluctuating field . for the case of the interaction being of a heisenberg exchange type </S>",
    "<S> , we first analytically show the possibility for robust stationary entanglement for realistic values of the dissipation rates and then analyze its robustness as a function of the noise to signal ratio of the pump . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for a common fluctuating driving field , a stochastic resonance effect appears as function of the ratio between field strength and noise strength . </S>",
    "<S> the effect disappears in the case of uncorrelated or separate pumps . </S>",
    "<S> our result is general and could be applied to different quantum systems ranging from electron spins in solid state , to ions trap technologies and cold atom set ups .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction : _ entanglement is nowadays commonly considered a resource for quantum information processing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being of a purely quantum nature can be easily degraded by reservoir contaminations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , recently the possibility of having stationary entanglement in open quantum systems has been put forward @xcite , also achieving experimental evidence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however it is not clear how robust is such stationary entanglement against other sources of noise that can eventually affect the system , especially when originating from the pump .    in this work we aim at clarifying the robustness of stationary entanglement in lossy coupled systems in the presence of noise in the amplitude fluctuations of the driving field . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the case of the always on exchange interactions between the systems , usually employed when dealing with local dissipative environments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement robustness is characterized by means of a figure of merit related to the quantum concurrence and accounts for the signal to noise ratio of the driving field . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish the case of local and global fluctuations and show that in the latter case stochastic resonance like effects @xcite can emerge for an optimal ratio between the strength and the noise of the common driving field . </S>",
    "<S> the effect disappears in the case of uncorrelated or separate pumps .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is general , the results are analytic , and could be applied to different set ups ranging from electron spins in double quantum dots or in effective spin models generated in driven ions , cold atoms and coupled cavity arrays ups@xcite    _ the system : _ we assume two coupled dimer systems labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 interacting through an exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the systems are subject to incoherent driving of amplitude @xmath2 from outside and dissipate independently into two separate reservoirs with equal dissipation rates given by @xmath3(see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian describing the coherent part of the interaction in this case is : @xmath4 with @xmath5s the usual pauli operators on @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the open system dynamics will be described by the master equation @xmath9 + \\mathcal{d}{[\\sigma_a]}\\rho+\\mathcal{d}[\\sigma_b]\\rho , \\label{me1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10b:=\\gamma(2aba^{\\dag}-a^{\\dag}ab - ba^{\\dag}a),\\ ] ] denotes the dissipative super - operator and @xmath3 is the decay rate into the two separate environments .    in this </S>",
    "<S> work besides looking for entanglement at steady state , we would also investigate its robustness against fluctuations in the driving field . </S>",
    "<S> we thus assume that the driving field on top of its coherent amplitude @xmath2 , exhibits a gaussian white noise term @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 measuring the noise strength .        </S>",
    "<S> hence the master equation will become @xmath9 + \\mathcal{d}[\\sigma_a]\\rho+\\mathcal{d}[\\sigma_b]\\rho+\\mathcal{n}[\\sigma_a^y;\\sigma_b^y]\\rho , \\label{me2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the superoperator describing the noisy effects of @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the steady state solution of eq.([me2 ] ) can be found by writing the density operator and the other operators in a matrix form , in the basis @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> let us parametrize the density operator as @xmath16    once we know the steady state density matrix , to quantify the entanglement we will use the concurrence @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 s are , in decreasing order , the nonnegative square roots of the moduli of the eigenvalues of @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> we will separate our analysis in two cases , the common driving case where both systems are subject to the same fluctuating pump and the case when independent driving is applied to each one .    </S>",

    "<S> [ concur1 ] we may also observe that entanglement is quite robust in the range of pumping slightly larger than the decay rate and it survives for white noise up to 10@xmath34 in the fluctuating field .    to quantify the robustness of entanglement versus noise in the driving field we may consider the signal to noise ratio @xmath35 for @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath36 and @xmath27 corresponding to the value for which @xmath37 becomes zero . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath26 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we do not have any stochastic resonance like effects , as matter of fact the quantity is zero everywhere for all values of signal to noise ratio .     </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath2 and @xmath27 for @xmath29.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    by comparing figure [ concur2 ] and [ concur1 ] we may realize that entanglement is less robust in this case with respect to the previous one . as matter of fact , the maximum value of concurrence decreases to zero when the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath42 in contrast to the previous case where the corresponding ratio was @xmath43 . in figure [ signoi ] ( top curve ) </S>",
