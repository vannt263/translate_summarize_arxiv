    "[ [ section ] ]    thermodynamics of black holes in anti de sitter ( ads ) space has received renewed attention since the discovery of the phase transition phenomena in the schwarzschild ads background@xcite . till date",
    "several attempts have been made in order to describe the phase transition phenomena in black holes@xcite-@xcite .",
    "all these works are basically based on the fact that at the critical point(s ) of phase transition the specific heat of the black hole diverges .",
    "inspite of all these attempts , the issue regarding the classification of the nature of the phase transition in black holes remains highly debatable and worthy of further investigations . at this stage",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in usual thermodynamics it is a general practice to adopt the ehrenfest s scheme@xcite in order to classify the phase transition phenomena@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to two of its basic advantages namely , ( i ) it is simple and elegant and ( ii ) it provides a unique way to classify the nature of the phase transition in ordinary thermodynamic systems .",
    "even if a phase transition is not truly a second order , we can determine the degree of its deviation by defining a new parameter called prigogine - defay ratio ( @xmath0)@xcite . inspired by all these facts , we propose a possible way to overcome the long standing problem regarding the classification of phase transition in black holes by incorporating the idea of ehrenfest s scheme from standard thermodynamics . since black holes in many respects behave as ordinary thermodynamic objects , therefore the extension of ehrenfest s scheme to black hole thermodynamics seems to be quite natural .",
    "such an attempt has been triggered very recently@xcite-@xcite .",
    "constructing gravity theories in presence of various higher derivative corrections to the usual maxwell action has been a popular topic of research for the past several years@xcite-@xcite . among these non - linear theories of electrodynamics",
    "it is the born - infeld theory that has earned renewed attention for the past few decades due to its several remarkable features . as a matter of fact einstein - born - infeld theory admits various static black hole solutions that possess several significant qualitative features which is absent in ordinary einstein - maxwell gravity .",
    "these are given by- ( i ) depending on the value of the electric charge ( @xmath1 ) and the born - infeld coupling parameter ( @xmath2 ) it is observed that a meaningful black hole solution exists only for @xmath3 . on the other hand , for @xmath4 the corresponding extremal limit does not exist .",
    "this eventually puts a restriction on the parameter space of bi - ads black holes@xcite .",
    "this is indeed an interesting feature which is absent in the usual einstein - maxwell theory , ( ii ) furthermore , one can note that for @xmath5 , which corresponds to the critical born - infeld - ads ( bi - ads ) case , there exists a new type of phase transition ( hp3 ) which has identical thermodynamical features as observed during the phase transition phenomena in non - rotating btz black holes@xcite .",
    "this is also an interesting observation that essentially leads to a remarkable thermodynamical analogy which does not hold in the corresponding reissener - nordstom - ads ( rn - ads ) limit .",
    "motivated by all the above mentioned features , in the present work , we therefore aim to carry out a further investigation regarding the thermodynamic behavior of bi - ads black holes@xcite,@xcite-@xcite in the framework of standard thermodynamics .",
    "we adopt the ehrenfest s scheme of usual thermodynamics in order to resolve a number of vexing issues regarding the phase transition phenomena in bi - ads black holes .",
    "the critical points correspond to an infinite discontinuity in the specific heat ( @xmath6 ) , which indicates the onset of a continuous higher order transition . at this point",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , an attempt to verify the ehrenfest s equations for charged ( rn - ads ) black holes was first initiated in @xcite .",
    "there@xcite , based on numerical techniques , the authors had computed both the ehrenfest s equations close to the critical point(s ) . however , due the presence of infinite divergences in various thermodynamic entities ( like , heat capacity etc . ) , as well as the lack of analytic techniques , at that time it was not possible to check the ehrenfest s equations exactly at the critical point(s ) . in order to address the above mentioned issues",
    ", the present paper therefore aims to provide an analytic scheme in order to check the ehrenfest s equations exactly at the critical point(s ) .",
    "moreover , the present analysis has been generalized taking the particular example of bi - ads black holes which is basically the non - linear generalization of rn - ads black holes .",
    "our analysis shows that it is indeed a second order phase transition .    finally , we apply the widely explored state space geometry approach@xcite-@xcite to analyze the phase transition phenomena in bi - ads black holes@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that the scalar curvature ( @xmath7 ) diverges exactly at the critical points where @xmath6 diverges .",
    "this signifies the presence of a second order phase transition , thereby vindicating our earlier analysis based on ehrenfest s scheme .",
    "it is also reassuring to note that , in the appropriate limit ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) one recovers corresponding results for rn - ads black holes@xcite , where @xmath2 is the born - infeld parameter and @xmath1 is the charge of the black hole .    before we proceed further ,",
    "let us mention about the organization of our paper .",
    "in section 2 we have discussed thermodynamics of the bi black holes in ads space . using ehrenfest s scheme ,",
    "the nature of the phase transition has been discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we analyze the phase transition using the ( thermodynamic ) state space geometry approach .",
    "finally we draw our conclusion in section 5 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in order to obtain a finite total energy for the field around a point - like charge , born and infeld proposed a non - linear electrodynamics@xcite in 1934 .",
    "the born - infeld black hole solution with or without a cosmological constant is a non - linear extension of the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the born - infeld solution in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ads space - time ( with a negative cosmological constant @xmath10 ) which is given by@xcite , @xmath11 where we have taken the gravitational constant @xmath12 . here the metric coefficient @xmath13 is given by , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hypergeometric function@xcite and @xmath2 is the born - infeld parameter . in the limit @xmath8 , @xmath9 one obtains the corresponding solution for the rn - ads space - time . at this stage",
    "it is reassuring to note that the rest of the analysis has been carried out keeping all terms in the hyper geometric series @xmath16 .",
    "the adm mass of the black hole is defined by @xmath17 , which yields , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius of the outer horizon . using ( 2 )",
    ", the hawking temperature for the bi - ads black holes may be obtained as , @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the first law of black hole thermodynamics we get , @xmath21 . using this",
    "we can obtain the entropy of the black hole as , @xmath22    substituting ( 5 ) in ( 4 ) we can rewrite the hawking temperature as@xcite , @xmath23\\ ] ]    ) plot for bi - ads black hole with respect to entropy ( @xmath24 ) for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    we can see from figure-1 that , there is a ` hump ' and a ` dip ' in the @xmath27 graph .",
    "another interesting thing about the graph is that , it is continuous in @xmath24 .",
    "this rules out the possibility of first order phase transition . in order to check whether there is a possibility of higher order phase transition , we compute the specific heat at constant potential ( @xmath6 ) ( which is analog of the specific heat at constant pressure ( @xmath28 ) in usual thermodynamics ) .    the electrostatic potential difference between the black hole horizon and the infinity is defined by@xcite , @xmath29 using ( 5 ) we may further express @xmath30 as , @xmath31 from the thermodynamical relation    @xmath32    we find , @xmath33    where we have used the thermodynamic identity @xmath34 finally using ( 6 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) , the heat capacity @xmath6 may be expressed as , @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37    ) against entropy ( @xmath24 ) , at the second critical point ( @xmath38 ) , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    ) against entropy ( @xmath24 ) , at the second critical point ( @xmath38 ) , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    before going into the algebric details , let us first plot @xmath39 graphs ( figure ( 2 ) & figure ( 3 ) ) and make a qualitative analysis of the plots .    from these figures",
    "it is evident that the heat capacity ( @xmath6 ) suffers discontinuities exactly at two points ( @xmath40 and @xmath38 ) which correspond to the critical points for the phase transition phenomena in bi - ads black holes .",
    "similar conclusion also follows from the @xmath27 plot ( figure ( 1 ) ) , where the ` hump ' corresponds to @xmath40 and the ` dip ' corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "the graph of @xmath39 shows that there are three phases of the black hole - phase i ( @xmath41 ) , phase ii ( @xmath42 ) and phase iii ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "since the higher mass black hole possess larger entropy / horizon radius , therefore at @xmath40 we encounter a phase transition from a smaller mass black hole ( phase i ) to an intermediate ( higher mass ) black hole ( phase ii ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath38 corresponds to the critical point for the phase transition from the intermediate black hole ( phase ii ) to a larger mass black hole ( phase iii ) .",
    "finally , from figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we also note that the heat capacity ( @xmath6 ) is positive for phase i and phase iii , whereas it is negative for phase ii .",
    "therefore , phase i and phase iii correspond to the thermodynamically stable phases ( @xmath44 ) , whereas phase ii stands for a thermodynamically unstable phase ( @xmath45 ) .    from the above discussions",
    "it is evident that the phase transitions we encounter in bi - ads black holes are indeed continuous higher order . in order to address it",
    "more specifically ( i.e. whether it is a second order or any higher order transition ) , we adopt a specific scheme , known as ehrenfest s scheme in standard thermodynamics .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    discontinuity in the heat capacity does not always imply a seecond order transition , rather it suggests a continuous higher order transition in general .",
    "ehrenfest s equations play an important role in order to determine the nature of such higher order transitions for various conventional thermodynamical systems@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this scheme can be applied in a simple and elegant way in standard thermodynamic systems .",
    "the nature of the corresponding phase transition can also be classified by applying this scheme .",
    "moreover , even if a phase transition is not a genuine second order , we can determine the degree of its deviation by calculating the prigogine - defay ( pd ) ratio@xcite .",
    "inspired by all these facts , we apply a similar technique to classify the phase transition phenomena in ( bi - ads ) black holes and check the validity of ehrenfest s scheme for black holes .    in conventional thermodynamics , the first and the second ehrenfest s equations@xcite",
    "are given by , @xmath46 in case of black hole thermodynamics , pressure ( @xmath47 ) is replaced by the negative of the electrostatic potential difference ( @xmath48 ) and volume ( @xmath49 ) is replaced by charge ( @xmath1 ) of the black hole .",
    "thus , for the black hole thermodynamics , the two ehrenfest s equations become@xcite , @xmath50 respectively . here ,",
    "the suffices 1 and 2 denote two distinct phases of the system .",
    "in addition to that , @xmath51 is the _ volume expansion coefficient _ and @xmath52 is the _ isothermal compressibility _ of the system which are defined as , @xmath53 using ( 6 ) and ( 8) and considering the thermodynamic relation ,    @xmath54    we can show that , @xmath55 where the denominator was identified earlier ( ( 13 ) ) .    in order to calculate @xmath52 ,",
    "we make use of the thermodynamic identity , @xmath56    using ( 10 ) we obtain from ( 21 ) @xmath57 using ( 6 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 22 ) we finally obtain , @xmath58    where @xmath59\\ ] ] and the denominator @xmath60 is given by ( 13 ) .    note that , the denominators of both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are indeed identical with that of @xmath6 .",
    "this is manifested in the fact that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 diverge exactly at the point(s ) where @xmath63 diverges ( figs . 4 - 7 ) .    ) against entropy ( @xmath24 ) , at the second critical point ( @xmath38 ) , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    ) against entropy ( @xmath24 ) , at the second critical point ( @xmath38 ) , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    ) against entropy ( @xmath24 ) , at the second critical point ( @xmath38 ) , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    ) against entropy ( @xmath24 ) , at the second critical point ( @xmath38 ) , for fixed @xmath25 and @xmath26.__,width=566 ]    being familiar with the two ehrenfest s equations and knowing @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we can now determine the order of the phase transition . in order to do that",
    ", we shall analytically check the validity of the two ehrenfest s equations at the points of discontinuity @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that at the points of divergence , we denote the critical values for the temperature ( @xmath66 ) and charge ( @xmath1 ) as @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",

    "it is reassuring to note that the first application of the ehrenfest s scheme in order to determine the nature of phase transition in charged ( reissener - nordstrom ( rn - ads ) ) ads black holes had been commenced in @xcite . there",
    "the analysis had been carried out _ numerically _ in order to check the validity of the ehrenfest s equations close to the critical point(s ) . frankly speaking the analysis presented in @xcite was actually in an underdeveloped stage .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that at that time no such _ analytic _ scheme was available . as a result ,",

    "this also establishes their compatibility while studying phase transitions in black holes .",
