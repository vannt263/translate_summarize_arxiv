    "this corresponds to the well studied @xmath102-model which is in the universality class of the ising model@xcite .",
    "we can provide here only a description of the results that are obtained , a full detailed solution will be presented elsewhere . if @xmath64 the qualitative description of the forbidden nucleation region are completely equivalent to the @xmath31 case , i.e. , the previously discussed pressure - temperature phase diagram and in particular the description of the forbidden nucleation wedge are not qualitatively affected . for @xmath63 and sufficiently low temperatures , by driving the system through the transition , the limit of forbidden nucleation is reached before the stability limit . therefore , there exists a pressure region , outside the window of forbidden nucleation , where the system can still remain in a metastable state until reaching the spinodal pressure , and a standard nucleation and growth process may occur due to the surface energy contribution of the gradient term .",
    "however , it is possible to show that this nucleation and growth region never reaches the critical point . from this",

    "a wedge where nucleation does not occur is observed in ce@xcite , sms@xcite and related systems .",
    "interestingly it is also observed in a volume - collapse transition in amorphous ice@xcite .",
    "however without detailed studies it is difficult to be sure that it does not arise from the usual hysteresis due to a finite driving rate , as occurs in other first order transitions .",
    "other indicators , however , point more strongly to the applicability of our theory .    in agreement with the present theory mf critical exponents have been observed in ce systems@xcite .",
    "the connection with long - range strain effects has long been suspected@xcite but , to the best of our knowledge , has not received a microscopic explanation in mixed - valence systems .",
    "in contrast with usual first - order phase transitions , where hysteresis is not intrinsic , one can define here a critical exponent for the pressure width of the hysteresis loop : @xmath104(b ) supporting our conclusion that @xmath88 is an intrinsic property of the system .    also in contrast with usual first - order transitions , critical behavior ( although classical like ) can be easily observed far from the critical point .",
    "the divergence of the compressibility discussed above implies that the bulk modulus vanishes as @xmath105 and jumps discontinuously to a finite value for @xmath106 .",
    "remarkably , after this work was completed and a preliminary version of it was posted@xcite this prediction was experimentally verified in ce@xcite .",
    "decreasing the pressure , the jump and the square root singularity change sides and occur at @xmath87 .",
    "similar behavior is found as a function of temperature .",
    "also an anomaly measured in ybincu@xmath107 on cooling resembles our prediction when plotted in an appropriate scale ( see inset of fig .  4 in ref .",
    "this also explains the appearance of precursor effects which have been very puzzling in the mixed - valence literature and have led some authors to interpret the transition as second order@xcite .",
    "a divergent compressibility implies the unusual property that the poisson s ratio will become negative and approach @xmath108 .",
    "a negative poisson s ratio is indeed observed in the sms system and is generally associated with mixed - valence behavior@xcite .",
    "since the unusual elastic properties we find ( including negative compressibility ) occur in extensive temperature and volume ranges which can additionally be tuned by alloying and external fields we conclude that mixed - valence systems are ideal candidates for applications like induced hardening and giant damping ( c.f . ref .",

    "this electronic effect is crucial whereas the shear rigidity does not play a relevant role@xcite .    to check the relevance of the temperature scale set by the shear modulus in determining real values of @xmath110 we take the opposite point of view ,",
    "i.e. , we neglect the temperature dependence of the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fgl ] ) and take into account the effect of the shear rigidity alone .",

    "in particular we find a softening of the bulk modulus as the transition is approached .    in many respects",
    "the physics is similar to spinodal decompositions of alloys ; however , an important difference is that in the present case the order parameter is not conserved , slow atomic diffusion is not involved , and the kinetics of the problem is very fast .",

    "our results provide a simple explanation for these precursor effects without invoking peculiar temperature dependence of electronic properties and clarify the rather confusing issue of the order of the transition .",
    "this unusual transition shares characteristics with a second - order transition ( diverging compressibility ) and a first - order transition ( discontinuous order parameter ) .    our analysis has been simplistic , particularly in the fact that we considered the two phases to be elastically isotropic and with the same value of the elastic coefficients , and the transition to be coherent , namely no structural defects ( dislocations ) were supposed to appear during the transition .",
