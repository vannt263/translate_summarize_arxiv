    "the standard unification model ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) asserts that the nuclei in both type-1 and type-2 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have basically the same structure containing a supermassive black hole , an accretion disk , a molecular torus and a broad line region .",
    "then their classification as type-1 or type-2 agn depends solely on the viewing angle . specifically , if the source is observed at sufficiently high inclination angle and thus the line of sight intersects the torus , it would be classified as a seyfert-2 , whereas for all other orientations it would be deemed to be a seyfert-1 .",
    "x - ray observations of seyfert-2 galaxies with _ ginga _ , _ asca _ and _ rxte _ ( smith & done 1996 ; turner et al .",
    "1997 ; georgantopoulos & papadakis 2001 ) observe large absorbing columns supporting this scenario .",
    "however , optical surveys for agn have failed so far to produce large numbers of obscured agn beyond the local universe .",
    "in contrast , recent x - ray surveys have proved very useful in finding evidence for the presence of such obscured agn population at moderate to high redshifts ( @xmath5 ) . in particular , _ rosat _ surveys ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) have detected a number of narrow - line galaxies ( nlg ) the majority of which are associated with obscured agn ( boyle et al .",
    "1995 , schmidt et al .",
    "1998 , lehmann et al .",
    "_ asca _ and _ bepposax _ surveys have also found some examples of such an obscured agn population ( boyle et al . 1998 ; georgantopoulos et al . 1999",
    "; fiore et al . 1999 ; akiyama et al .",
    "2000 ) , in the hard 2 - 10 kev band which is less prone to photoelectric absorption .",
    "these agn present column densities typically higher than @xmath6 while in some cases their optical spectra may present broad lines with only moderate optical reddening .",
    "the above results have been corroborated by recent _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ surveys ( eg mushotzky et al . 2000 , brandt et al .",
    "2001 , hasinger et al .",
    "moreover , _ asca _",
    "( nakanishi et al . 2000 ) , _ chandra _ ( norman et al . 2001 ) and xmm ( lehmann et al .",
    "2001 ) have produced the first examples of the long sought type-2 qso population i.e. with no signs of broad emission lines , similar to seyfert-2 galaxies in the local universe .",
    "obscured agn should emit copious amounts of ir radiation as the obscuring matter reprocesses the optical radiation .",
    "therefore , the combination of x - ray and ir observations is a powerful tool in the detection of such obscured objects . in particular , using both the @xmath1 and the x - ray hardness ratios , we can detect the obscured agn , due to the fact that the latter quantities are excellent indicators of high photoelectric absorption .",
    "green et al . ( 1992 ) , combined far - infrared ( iras ) and x - ray ( einstein ) data , finding a significant correlation between luminosities in the 60-@xmath0 m and 0.5 - 4.5 kev .",
    "they also find that the @xmath1 ratios of broad - line agn are significantly higher than those of narrow - line agn and star - forming galaxies . in a similar way , boller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) cross - correlated the _ rosat _ with the iras all - sky surveys .",
    "the resulting sample consists of about 200 objects of which many are obscured seyfert galaxies ( moran , halpern & helfand 1996 ) .",
    "more recently , gunn et al . (",
    "2001 ) have observed with isophot onboard iso 15 sources ( qsos and narrow - line agn ) detected in deep _ rosat _ fields .",
    "the large number of narrow line objects detected suggests that large amounts of obscuring matter are present in these objects .",

    "_ bepposax _ an area of 0.7 @xmath7 from the elais iso survey ( oliver et al .",

    "they find 17 common sources in the hard 2 - 10 kev band and the @xmath10 band .",
    "surprisingly , no obscured agn are among these sources .    here",
    "we cross - correlate the elais ( oliver et al .",

    "the _ rosat _",
    "observations presented here are complementary as they cover the _ full _ area of the elais survey , albeit at much brighter fluxes .",
    "our aim is to find a number of obscured agn especially at high redshift and explore their nature .",
    "we note that although the _ rosat _ passband is soft ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) and therefore more susceptible to photoelectric absorption as compared to either _ bepposax _ or _ chandra _ , at high redshifts the k - correction diminishes the _ effective _ obscuring column as it moves the photoelectric absorption cut - off towards lower energies .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in section 2 , we describe the elais and _ rosat _",
    "catalogues used as well as the cross - correlation results , while in sections 3 and 4 we present the discussion and conclusions .",
    "the european large area iso survey ( elais ) has surveyed @xmath1412 square deegres of the sky at 15@xmath0 m , 90@xmath0 m and subsets of this area at 6.75@xmath0 m and 175@xmath0 m using the isocam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) onboard the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , ( kessler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the catalogue , a reliable subset of the preliminary analysis catalogue ( serjeant et al . 2000 ) , contains 484 sources down to a flux limit of @xmath15 in the 15 @xmath16 band .",
    "the positional error of the @xmath17 @xmath16 catalogue is typically 3 arcsec ( serjeant et al .",
    "2000 ) . a large number of the 15@xmath0 m sources ( with optical counterparts down to @xmath18 ) have been spectroscopically identified containing a large fraction of agn and star - forming galaxies ( cabrera - guerra et al .",

    "we have used _ rosat _ data from the pspc ( position sensitive proportional catalogue counter ) operating in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band .",
    "in particular , we have used the rassbsc , rassfsc and wgacat point source catalogues .",
    "rassbsc ( _ rosat _ all - sky survey bright source catalogue ) is derived from the all - sky _ rosat _ survey and contains 18811 sources ( voges et al .",

    "rassfsc ( _ rosat _ all - sky survey faint source catalogue ) is an extension of the rassbsc ( voges et al . 2000 ) and contains approximately 106,000 sources .",
    "wgacat is a point source catalogue generated from all rosat pspc pointed observations ( see white , giommi & angelini 1994 ) .",

    "the pspc has an energy resolution of 0.5 kev at 1 kev , but limited spatial resolution ( fwhm @xmath19 ) .",

    "we have performed 20 simulations in order to assess the probability of chance coincidences .",
    "we are offseting the actual elais source coordinates by a few arcminutes and then we are repeating the cross - correlation .",

    "therefore , the low @xmath1 ratio could be attributed to either an intrinsically low x - ray emission ( similar to pg1011 - 040 , gallagher et al .",
    "2001 ) or alternatively to high ir luminosity .",
    "indeed , this source has a luminosity of @xmath3 .",
    "for comparison we note that our source has an @xmath1 ratio a few times lower than that of the hyperluminous source ( @xmath57 ) elaisp90-j164010 + 410502 ( morel et al .",

    "then the high luminosity of elaisc15-j163310 + 405644 implies the presence of an active nucleus in this object .",

    "<S> we present a cross - correlation between the elais 15@xmath0 m iso survey with the _ rosat _ ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) all - sky survey and the pointed observations wgacat source catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting sample contains 15 objects . </S>",
    "<S> optical spectroscopic identifications exist for 13 objects : 6 broad - line qsos , 4 narrow line galaxies or type-2 agn ( nlg ) and 3 stars . </S>",
    "<S> we have used both the x - ray to ir luminosity flux ratio @xmath1 and the x - ray hardness ratios diagnostics to estimate the amount of obscuration in these objects . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum of the narrow - line galaxies does not present strong evidence for obscuration ; however , the low @xmath1 ratio combined with the high x - ray luminosities suggest that at least one of the narrow line galaxies is associated with an obscured seyfert nucleus . 4 out of 6 qsos present high @xmath1 ratios and steep x - ray spectra with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> one qso ( elaisc15-j133442 + 375736 ) at a redshift of z=1.89 , has an abnormally low x - ray / ir flux ratio , with its infrared luminosity approaching that of an hyperluminous galaxy ( @xmath3 ) . finally , one radio - loud qso is the hardest x - ray source in our sample , presenting strong evidence for a high absorbing column ( @xmath4 ) .    </S>",
