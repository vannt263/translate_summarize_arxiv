    "the main distinctions of the detectors with doped and electrically induced p - i - n - junction are that the fermi energies of electrons and holes in the latter depend on the gate voltages @xmath83 in the p - section and @xmath84 in the n - section [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] and that these energies and , hence , the heights of the barriers confining electrons and holes in the pertinent section are different in different gls .",
    "this is due to the screening of the transverse electric field created by the gate voltages by the gl charges .",
    "this screening results in a marked decrease in the barrier heights of the gls located in the mgl - structure depth ( with large indices @xmath25 ) in comparison with the gls near the top . in the following , we set @xmath85 .",
    "the barriers in question effectively prevent the electron and hole injection from the contacts under the reverse bias if the barrier heights are sufficiently large . however , the electron and hole injection into the gls with large @xmath25 leads to a significant increase in the dark current ( in addition to the current of the electrons and hole generated in the i - section ) .",

    "considering eqs .",
    "( a5 ) and ( a6 ) from the appendix , the latter imposes the following limitation on the number of gls in glds with the electrically - induced p - i - n junctions and the gate voltage @xmath91 : @xmath92 the quantity @xmath93 is defined in the appendix . for @xmath94 , assuming that the fermi energy in the topmost gl @xmath95  mev , @xmath58  k , @xmath96  @xmath56 , @xmath97 m , and @xmath98  @xmath56s@xmath57 , we obtain @xmath99 , i.e. , fairly large . a decrease in @xmath68 results in smaller @xmath100 due to a substantial increase in the tunneling current .",

    "the product of the factors in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 21 ) except the last one can be on the order of unity .",

    "the glpd responsivity and detectivity can also markedly exceed those of qdips ( for which formulas similar to eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) can be used ) despite lower capture probability and thermoexcitation rate in qdips in comparison with qwips ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "the ratios @xmath161 and @xmath162 dramatically increases with decreasing @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the spectral dependence of the glpds detectivity is similar to the spectral dependence of the responsivity ( @xmath165 ) , whereas the glpds intended for the photodetection in different spectral ranges exhibit the same dark current ( due to the gapless energy spectrum ) .",
    "in contrast , in qwips , qdips , and some other photodetectors ( see , for example ,  refs .",
    "@xcite ) the transition to lower photon frequency requires to utilize the structures with lower ionization energy and , hence , exponentially higher dark current .",
    "the latter leads to quite different spectral dependencies of the glpd detectivity and the detectivity of qwips and qdips ( which drops with increasing photon freqiency ) .",
    "glpds can surpuss qwips and qdips in responsivity even at relatively high photon frequencies .",

    ", we obtain @xmath175  @xmath176hz@xmath61/w and @xmath177  @xmath63hz@xmath61/w , respectively .",
    "glpds can surpass also photodetectors on narrow - gap and gapless bulk semiconductors like hgcdte ( bspds ) .",
    "apart from advantages associated with potentially simpler fabrication , glpds might exhibit higher detectivity ( compare the data above and those from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this can be attributed to relatively low thermogeneration rate in glpds compared to bspds with very narrow or zeroth gap .",
    "the point is that thermogeneration rate in glpds at room temperatures is primarily due absorption of optical phonons  @xcite which have fairly large energy @xmath178 ( the auger processes in gls are forbidden  @xcite ) , whereas this rate in bspds is essentially determined by the auger processes which are strong  @xcite .",
    "analyzing eqs .",
    "( 4 ) - ( 7 ) , we accepted that @xmath179 and , therefore , disregarded the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient @xmath28 associated with the population of the low energy states by electrons and holes .",
    "for a rough estimate , the value of distribution function @xmath180 can be presented as @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the electron and hole density in the i - section under the reverse bias .",
    "this density , in turn , can be estimated as @xmath183 . using the same parameters as above , for @xmath97 m and @xmath184  k , we obtain @xmath185 , so that @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "it implies that the numerical data obtained above for the frequencies at the lower end of the thz range might be slightly overestimated .",
    "however , since the electron - hole system in the i - section can be pronouncedly heated by the electric field , the actual values of @xmath188 can be smaller than in the latter estimate and , hence , @xmath28 can be rather close to @xmath29 .",
    "the electron and hole heating in intrinsic gls under the electric field was studied recently  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cases considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , the finiteness of the transit time of electrons and holes in the i - section of the gl - structures under consideration strongly affects the electron and hole heating .",
    "therefore , more careful calculation of @xmath28 at relatively low @xmath3 requires separate consideration .    in summary , we proposed and evaluated glpds multiple - gl p - i - n structures .",
    "it was shown that glpds can exhibit high responsivity and detectivity in the thz and ir ranges at room temperatures .",
    "due to relatively high quantum efficiency and low thermogeneration rate , the glpd responsivity and detectivity can substantially exceed those of other photodetectors .",

    "<S> we propose to utilize multiple - graphene - layer structures with lateral p - i - n junctions for terahertz ( thz ) and infrared ( ir ) photodetection and substantiate the operation of photodetectors based on these structures . using the developed device model , we calculate the detector dc responsivity and detectivity as functions of the number of graphene layers and geometrical parameters and show that the dc responsivity and detectivity can be fairly large , particularly , at the lower end of the thz range at room temperatures . due to relatively high quantum efficiency and low thermogeneration rate , the photodetectors under consideration can substantially surpass other thz and ir detectors </S>",
    "<S> . calculations of the detector responsivity as a function of modulation frequency of thz and ir radiation demonstrate that the proposed photodetectors are very fast and can operate at the modulation frequency of several tens of ghz . </S>"
