    "we consider eigenvalue problems @xmath1 and also ( for any @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a real - valued symmetric matrix satisfying the following asymptotic conditions :    * ( a1 ) * the limits @xmath6 exist , and for all @xmath7 , @xmath8    * ( a2 ) * the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are all non - negative .",
    "we denote the smallest among all these eigenvalues @xmath10 .    our particular interest lies in counting the number of negative eigenvalues for @xmath11 ( i.e. , the morse index ) .",
    "we proceed by relating the morse index to the maslov index , which is described in section [ maslov_section ] .",
    "in essence , we find that the morse index can be computed in terms of the maslov index , and that while the maslov index is less elementary than the morse index , it can be computed ( numerically ) in a relatively straightforward way .",
    "the maslov index has its origins in the work of v. p. maslov @xcite and subsequent development by v. i. arnold @xcite .",
    "it has now been studied extensively , both as a fundamental geometric quantity @xcite and as a tool for counting the number of eigenvalues on specified intervals @xcite . in this latter context , there has been a strong resurgence of interest following the analysis by deng and jones ( i.e. , @xcite ) for multidimensional domains .",
    "our aim in the current analysis is to rigorously develop a relationship between the maslov index and the morse index in the relatively simple setting of ( [ main ] ) .",
    "our approach is adapted from @xcite .    as a starting point , we define what we will mean by a _ lagrangian subspace _ of @xmath12 .",
    "[ lagrangian_subspace ] we say @xmath13 is a lagrangian subspace if @xmath14 has dimension @xmath15 and @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 denotes euclidean inner product on @xmath12 , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the @xmath21 identity matrix .",
    "we sometimes adopt standard notation for symplectic forms , @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we denote by @xmath23 the collection of all lagrangian subspaces of @xmath12 , and we will refer to this as the _ lagrangian grassmannian_.    a simple example , important for intuition , is the case @xmath24 , for which @xmath25 if and only if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are linearly dependent . in this case , we see that any line through the origin is a lagrangian subspace of @xmath28 . more generally , any lagrangian subspace of @xmath12 can be spanned by a choice of @xmath15 linearly independent vectors in @xmath12",
    ". we will find it convenient to collect these @xmath15 vectors as the columns of a @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 , which we will refer to as a _ frame _",
    "( sometimes _ lagrangian frame _ ) for @xmath14 . moreover , we will often write @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath21 matrices .",
    "suppose @xmath34 denote paths of lagrangian subspaces @xmath35 , for some parameter interval @xmath36 .",
    "the maslov index associated with these paths , which we will denote @xmath37 , is a count of the number of times the paths @xmath38 and @xmath39 intersect , counted with both multiplicity and direction .",
    "( precise definitions of what we mean in this context by _ multiplicity _ and _ direction _ will be given in section [ maslov_section ] . ) in some cases , the lagrangian subspaces will be defined along some path @xmath40 and when it s convenient we ll use the notation @xmath41 .",
    "we will verify in section [ odesection ] that under our assumptions on @xmath42 , and for @xmath43 , ( [ main ] ) will have @xmath15 linearly independent solutions that decay as @xmath44 and @xmath15 linearly independent solutions that decay as @xmath45 .",
    "we express these respectively as @xmath46 with also @xmath47 for @xmath48 , where the nature of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are developed in section [ odesection ] .",
    "the only details we ll need for this preliminary discussion are : ( 1 ) that we can continuously extend these functions to @xmath52 ( though they may no longer decay at one or both endstates ) , and ( 2 ) that under assumptions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) @xmath53    we will verify in section [ odesection ] that if we create a frame @xmath54 by taking @xmath55 as the columns of @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the respective columns of @xmath58 then @xmath59 is a frame for a lagrangian subspace , which we will denote @xmath60 . likewise ,",
    "we can create a frame @xmath61 by taking @xmath62 as the columns of @xmath63 and @xmath64 as the respective columns of @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 is a frame for a lagrangian subspace , which we will denote @xmath67 .    in constucting our lagrangian frames",
    ", we can view the exponential multipliers @xmath68 as expansion coefficients , and if we drop these off we retain frames for the same spaces .",
    "that is , we can create an alternative frame for @xmath60 by taking the expressions @xmath69 as the columns of @xmath56 and the expressions @xmath70 as the corresponding columns for @xmath58 . using ( [ limits ] )",
    "we see that in the limit as @xmath26 tends to @xmath71 we obtain the frame @xmath72 , where @xmath73 ( the dependence on @xmath74 is specified here to emphasize the fact that @xmath75 depends on @xmath74 through the multipliers @xmath76 . )",
    "we will verify in section [ odesection ] that @xmath77 is the frame for a lagrangian subspace , and we denote this space @xmath78 .",
    "proceeding similarly with @xmath67 , we obtain the asymptotic lagrangian subspace @xmath79 with frame @xmath80 , where @xmath81 ( the ordering of the columns of @xmath82 is simply a convention , which follows naturally from our convention for indexing @xmath62 . )",

    "this observation will allow us to construct the lagrangian subspaces @xmath60 and @xmath96 in that case through a development that looks identical to the discussion above .",

    "as discussed , for example , in @xcite , the essential spectrum of @xmath11 is determined by the asymptotic equations @xmath107 in particular , if we look for solutions of the form @xmath108 , for some scalar constant @xmath109 and ( non - zero ) constant vector @xmath110 then the essential spectrum will be confined to the allowable values of @xmath74 . for ( [ asymptotic ] ) , we find @xmath111 so that @xmath112 applying the min - max principle , we see that if the eigenvalues of @xmath9 are all non - negative then we will have @xmath113 , and more generally if @xmath95 denotes the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath9 then we will have @xmath114 .    away from essential spectrum ,",
    "we begin our construction of asymptotically decaying solutions to ( [ main ] ) by looking for solutions of ( [ asymptotic ] ) of the form @xmath115 , where in this case @xmath116 is a scalar function of @xmath74 , and @xmath117 is again a constant vector in @xmath118 . in this case",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath119 from which we see that the values of @xmath120 will correspond with eigenvalues of @xmath9 , and the vectors @xmath117 will be eigenvectors of @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the spectrum of @xmath9 by @xmath121 , ordered so that @xmath122 implies @xmath123 , and we order the eigenvectors correspondingly so that @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath9 are symmetric matrices , we can choose the set @xmath126 to be orthonormal , and similarly for @xmath127 .",
    "we have @xmath128 we will denote the admissible values of @xmath116 by @xmath129 , and for consistency we choose our labeling scheme so that @xmath122 implies @xmath130 ( for @xmath131 ) .",
    "this leads us to the specifications @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "we now express ( [ main ] ) as a first order system , with @xmath134 .",
    "we find @xmath135 and we additionally set @xmath136 we note that the eigenvalues of @xmath137 are precisely the values @xmath129 , and the associated eigenvectors are @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "[ odelemma ] let @xmath5 be a real - valued symmetric matrix , and suppose ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) hold .",

    ", we observe that associated with any path @xmath235 we will have a path of unitary complex matrices as described in ( [ tildew ] ) .",

    "when we talk about the direction of an intersection , we mean the direction the eigenvalues of @xmath213 are moving ( as @xmath238 varies ) along the unit circle @xmath239 when they cross @xmath216 ( we take counterclockwise as the positive direction ) .",
    "we note that all of the eigenvalues certainly do not all need to be moving in the same direction , and that we will need to take care with what we mean by a crossing in the following sense : we must decide whether to increment the maslov index upon arrival or upon departure .",
    "indeed , there are several different approaches to defining the maslov index ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and they often disagree on this convention .",
