    "ctrw theory includes ( i ) subdiffusion when the variance of jump lengths is finite but the waiting times have an infinite characteristic time ; ( ii ) lvy flights when the mean waiting time is finite but the jump length variance diverges ; and ( iii ) lvy walks in which waiting times and jump lengths are coupled , producing sub - ballistic superdiffusion with finite variance .",

    "potential applications for such behavior may , for instance , include geo- and astrophysical fluctuations , stock market pricing , or teletraffic .    based on simulations and analytical derivations we showed that , despite the driving fractional gaussian noise , the escape dynamics preserved the classical exponential shape of the distribution of escape times .",
