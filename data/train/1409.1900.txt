    "<S> organic semiconductors have generated considerable interest for their potential for creating inexpensive and flexible devices easily processed on a large scale  @xcite . however technological applications are currently limited by the low mobility of the charge carriers associated with the disorder in these materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much effort over the past decades has therefore been focused on optimizing the organisation of the material or the devices to improve carrier mobility . here </S>",
    "<S> we take a radically different path to solving this problem , namely by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the vacuum electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these are coherent states that can extend over as many as @xmath0 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity in such materials . to test this idea , </S>",
    "<S> organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to the vacuum electromagnetic field on plasmonic structures to form polaritonic states with large rabi splittings @xmath1 0.7 ev . conductivity experiments show that indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in the coupled state , reflecting mostly a change in field - effect mobility as revealed when the structure is gated in a transistor configuration . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical quantum model is presented that confirms the delocalization of the wave - functions of the hybridized states and the consequences on the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> while this is a proof - of - principle study , in practice conductivity mediated by light - matter hybridized states is easy to implement and we therefore expect that it will be used to improve organic devices . more broadly our findings illustrate the potential of engineering the vacuum electromagnetic environment to modify and to improve properties of materials .    </S>",
    "<S> light and matter can enter into the strong coupling regime by exchanging photons faster than any competing dissipation processes . </S>",
    "<S> this is normally achieved by placing the material in a confined electromagnetic environment , such as a fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity composed of two parallel mirrors that is resonant with an electronic transition in the material . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one can use surface plasmon resonances as in this study . </S>",
    "<S> strong coupling leads to the formation of two hybridized light - matter polaritonic states , p+ and p- , separated by the so - called rabi splitting , as illustrated in figure 1a . according to quantum electrodynamics , in the absence of dissipation , the rabi splitting for a single molecule </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cavity resonance or transition energy ( @xmath4 the reduced planck constant ) , @xmath5 the vacuum permittivity , @xmath6 the mode volume , @xmath7 the transition dipole moment of the material and @xmath8 the number of photons present in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the last term implies that , even in the dark , the rabi splitting has a finite value which is due to the interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this vacuum rabi splitting can be further increased by coupling a large number @xmath9 of oscillators to the electromagnetic mode since @xmath10  @xcite . in this ensemble coupling , in addition to p+ and p- , there are many other combinations of states , known as dark states @xcite , that are located in the middle of the rabi splitting as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a .    </S>",
    "<S> polaritons have been extensively studied in inorganic and organic materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vacuum rabi splittings as large as 1 ev have been reported for strongly coupled molecules  @xcite , thereby significantly modifying the electronic structure of the molecular material as can be seen in the work function , the ground state energy shift as well as in the chemical reactivity  @xcite . in such situations , p+ and p- are coherent collective states ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) that extend over the mode volume and may involve @xmath11 oscillators as in the present systems . </S>",
    "<S> this collective nature has been demonstrated by the coherent fluorescence of p- over micrometers distances in strongly coupled molecular states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> charge carrier mobility should also benefit from the extended coherence associated with light - hybridized states as compared to the normal carrier mobilities limited by the hopping between molecules and by scattering induced by molecular disorder .    while electron injected polariton leds and lasers </S>",
    "<S> have been reported in the last years  @xcite , conductivity mediated by light - hybridized materials has not been considered . </S>",
    "<S> one of the challenges in those studies has been to inject electrons into p+ or p- since these states have not just well defined energies but also momenta associated with their dispersion curves . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , molecular materials have the advantage that the energies of the states are inhomogenously broadened and fluctuating in time resulting in spectral widths that facilitates polariton creation via electron recombination . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the very first study of polariton electroluminescence was carried out on organic materials  @xcite .    in this study , </S>",
    "<S> an initial screening was carried out on different organic semiconductors known to be air - stable and display good field - effect mobilities in solution processed devices ( @xmath12 @xmath13v@xmath14s@xmath14 for optimized field effect geometries ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on three members of the aromatic di - imide family , an example of which , pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis of this molecule is described in supplementary section i. the other molecules are the brominated version of the former , pdi2eh - br@xmath15 , and the di - imide naphthalene polymer , p(ndi2od - t2 ) ( activink n2200 from polyera inc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , we have chosen these organic materials in view of their very different charge transport capacities but also because they all possess a lumo energy level at @xmath16 ev ( see supplementary section iv ) . </S>",
    "<S> this last observation rules out the injection capacity as a main parameter for the interpretation of the results appearing later in the manuscript when comparing their relative response . instead , as we will see , the differences that are important are the intrinsic charge transport capacity of each molecular system , influenced by the film disorder . </S>",
    "<S> these compounds possess intense absorption bands ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) that can be used to strongly couple them to surface plasmon ( sp ) resonances . for this </S>",
    "<S> we used a hexagonal array of holes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) in either al or ag films which give rise to well - defined sp resonances  @xcite also shown in fig .  1d . </S>",
    "<S> the low work - function of an al electrode is generally favorable for electron injection in n - type semiconductors . in the case of an ag electrode </S>",
    "<S> , we still have good electron injection , as confirmed in our experiments ( see supplementary section iv , fig . </S>",
    "<S> s6 ) . such efficient electron injection from high work function metals into pdi derivatives has been previously reported  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 1f and 1 g show the dispersion of surface plasmon resonances of the ag hole array as a function of hole period and the same when the array is covered with a thin film of pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> unlike with fabry - perot cavities , in the case of strong coupling with sps on hole arrays the upper polariton is less visible due to fano type interferences  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a rabi splitting of @xmath10.7 ev can be estimated , corresponding to 30@xmath17 of the transition energy , typical of the ultra - strong coupling regime  @xcite .    in order to assess the conductivity of strongly coupled organic semiconductors , we compare it to the one of the bare molecular material , by recording current - voltage ( i - v ) curves for thin films of the semiconductors between two electrodes as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . first </S>",
    "<S> , a 100 nm thick layer of al or ag was evaporated on a glass substrate through a shadow mask to yield a long 80 @xmath18 m wide strip . </S>",
    "<S> then hexagonal arrays with period @xmath19 were milled over a 55 @xmath18 m long area on the metal strip . </S>",
    "<S> the active channel , 50 @xmath18 m long , was defined by milling gaps g of 200 nm separating this area from the source and drain electrodes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the width of these gaps was found to be very important since a distance larger than the decay of the evanescent field ( @xmath1 the wavelength ) of the surface plasmon would result in the current flowing through an area where the material would not be hybridized . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the array continues for a few microns on both electrodes in order to ensure that the current is already injected into the strongly coupled system before reaching the active channel ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the i - v curves were then recorded for different array periods and compared to that of an unstructured metal film also covered with the organic semiconductors ( the reference ) . </S>",
    "<S> an example is shown for selected periods in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b in the case of the pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> similar experiments were carried out for the other two compounds . by plotting the current average at + /-15 v versus @xmath20 , @xmath19 the period of the array , two current resonances are clearly visible as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c for both pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 and p(ndi2od - t2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the current peaks happen for different periods . </S>",
    "<S> these correspond exactly to the intersections of the molecular absorption peaks and the surface plasmon modes ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) of the substrate side of the hole array where strong coupling occurs ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the current is boosted when the organic semiconductor is strongly hybridized with the surface plasmon modes . </S>",
    "<S> the current increases by over an order of magnitude in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> the third compound , pdi2eh - br@xmath15 , showed no detectable change in current with conductivity in the pa range ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between these compounds will be discussed below . </S>",
    "<S> please note that in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c , ag and al were chosen as the metal electrodes because in each case , the charge injection is optimal for each electrode / semiconductor combination ( see supplementary section iv ) . in addition , the injection from different metals was tested for pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 and p(ndi2od - t2 ) , as reported in the supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 for pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 and fig . </S>",
    "<S> s6 for p(ndi2od - t2 ) .    in the case of pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the same experiment was repeated on hexagonal hole arrays milled in an al film with the spectra shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a . </S>",
    "<S> the system shows ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) the strongest current resonance for a period of 280 nm which again corresponds to the strongly coupled condition . </S>",
    "<S> the current increases by roughly an order of magnitude as compared to the reference consisting of pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 on a flat al film . in order to further assess the electronic properties of the coupled system , </S>",
    "<S> a 3-terminal gated configuration was prepared as illustrated schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3d and 3e show the current versus the gating voltage for the on - resonance sample in al and the reference , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility extracted from this data shows an increase from 2.0@xmath21 @xmath22v@xmath14s@xmath14 -a value in agreement with the values extracted in a standard geometry ( see supplementary table i)- to 1.7@xmath23 @xmath22v@xmath14s@xmath14 . in other words the increased carrier mobility in the coupled system is responsible for most of the enhanced current .    </S>",
    "<S> the reference in the above data is always the unstructured metal film covered with the organic semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this reference shows a current larger than just the semiconductor , enhanced by the metallic substrate , but not shorted by the metal . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the measured field - effect mobility results from the intrinsic organic semiconducting properties . we have also checked random arrays of holes which show no current increases as expected since there are no well - defined plasmon resonances in such systems  @xcite .    to explain the above results </S>",
    "<S> , we introduced a simple theoretical model where each molecule is represented by two states forming the conduction and valence bands of the semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular states are resonantly coupled by the vacuum field with the relevant hamiltonian @xmath24 here , in a second - quantized formalism , @xmath25(@xmath26 ) and @xmath27(@xmath28 ) correspond to the destruction ( creation ) of an electron in the conduction band and of a hole in the valence band , respectively , with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the local electron ( hole ) occupation , and @xmath31 the site index ( i.e. , the molecule location ) for a system of size @xmath32 , @xmath32 corresponding to the number of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the local coupling @xmath33 ( with strength @xmath34 ) is mediated by the surface plasmon field ( with a delocalized surface plasmon wave vector @xmath35 ) resonant with the interband transition  @xcite , here represented by a destruction ( creation ) operator @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is the intermolecular spacing , in the nm range , and thus @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the third term represents processes where a surface plasmon is coherently created when an electron is transferred from the conduction to the valence band ( @xmath40 ) and , vice - versa , where a surface plasmon is coherently absorbed when an electron is promoted from the valence to the conduction band ( @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last term represents possible local shifts of the energy @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for the electrons ( holes ) , arising , e.g. , because of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - band hamiltonian eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) is reminiscent of the well - known jaynes - cummings model , however it allows for the dynamics of electron and hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent the quantum mechanical tunnelling rates of the charged particles between neighbouring sites . in the absence of disorder ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 for all @xmath31 ) and for @xmath50 , the first two terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) imply extended bloch - type wave - functions for electrons and holes that can in principle lead to a finite conductivity even at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , disorder in semiconductors in 1d is known to invariably lead to wave - function localization and vanishing conductivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a for @xmath51=0 where the probability density of a few chosen electronic states is shown to be exponentially localized for a situation where we have chosen disordered hopping rates @xmath52 and energy shifts @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 sets of random values ( see supplementary section vi ) .    upon coupling the system to the vacuum electromagnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , it is expected that polaritonic states delocalized throughout the mode volume should appear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b ( black curve ) for @xmath56 , where , remarkably , the electronic component of the polaritonic density is shown to be delocalized despite the strong disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this value for @xmath51 was chosen so that the collective coupling @xmath57 is larger than all other coherent and incoherent rates , allowing for reaching the strong coupling regime ( see supplementary section vi ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in addition to the polaritonic state we find that under conditions of strong coupling also other electronic states in the conduction band of the model are modified by the hybridization with the vacuum field and can become delocalized over the same length of the sample as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b for a few examples . </S>",
    "<S> this should have a considerable impact on conductivity , which we investigate next .    to probe the dynamics , we solve the master equation for the full density matrix of the system ( see supplementary section vi ) in the limit of low charge density . </S>",
    "<S> in order to mimic experiments , the master equation includes dissipative processes such as spontaneous decay of the plasmon mode and dephasing of the electron and hole wave - functions arising , e.g. , from local molecular vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> electrons are incoherently pumped into the system at a rate @xmath58 , similar to the effects of an applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c shows the equivalent of the i - v curves derived from this model for @xmath59 sites and both @xmath60 and @xmath56 . as can be seen , the current increases significantly in the presence of strong coupling . in the supplementary section </S>",
    "<S> vi we show that in fact significant enhancement is obtained only in the strong coupling regime , where the electronic wave - functions hybridized with light are delocalized .    despite its simplicity , the model clearly shows that the origin of the enhanced mobility under strong coupling can be explained by the extended coherence of the states induced by the hybridization with the vacuum field . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs over lengths that correspond to the mode volume ( on the scale of the wavelength of the resonance ) in contrast with the normal situation where the carrier is mostly confined to the molecular ( or a few molecule ) scale , in particular at room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that , like for all conductors , disorder can strongly hinder charge transport whatever the transport mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly shown in the case of pdi2eh - br@xmath15 which has a similar molecular structure to pdi2eh - cn@xmath15 , but which has much lower mobility  @xcite due to disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we found extremely weak resonant enhancement , if any , despite the strong coupling ( see supplementary fig . s2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the p(ndi2od - t2 ) polymer presents an intermediate case where despite the lower conductivity , the latter is enhanced by strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is also confirmed by the model in the presence of large disorder , where , while the relative improvement of conductivity increases with disorder strength for a fixed light coupling @xmath51 over the case @xmath60 , the whole conductivity tends to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced currents as well as the improved mobilities reported here demonstrate the potential of strong coupling for boosting conductivity in organic semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that at the same time the semiconducting properties are preserved . while we used surface plasmon resonances to couple to the organic semiconductors , metal micro - cavities or dielectric resonators </S>",
    "<S> could also be used provided that the mode volumes are sufficiently small that the strong coupling condition can be met . in particular metallic fabry - perot cavities lead to even larger rabi splittings than plasmonic arrays which is important to increase the fraction of coupled oscillators in the sample , as we have shown elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge , we have found , is to ensure that there is no leak via the top mirror when measuring the current parallel to the cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> conductivity of strongly coupled systems can be implemented with ease in a variety of designs and configurations , including in plastics , depending on the application . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results show the importance of engineering the electromagnetic environment of a material not just for optical purposes but also for modifying its properties through the formation of hybrid light - matter states . </S>",
    "<S> this opens new prospects for material science as well as device technology . </S>",
    "<S> + _ note added _ : since submission of this work , two theoretical works addressed the question of suppression of backscattering of conduction electrons for a two - dimensional electron gas off - resonantly coupled to a high - frequency classical electromagnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
