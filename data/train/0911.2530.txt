    "galaxy formation and evolution is strongly dependent on environment and on galaxy mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies in high density regions are systematically older than those in lower density regions , and massive galaxies are on average older than lower mass galaxies in stellar ages .",
    "it seems that massive galaxies in the high density regions form first and galaxy formation activity is propagated to lower density regions and to lower - mass galaxies with time .",
    "such dependence on environment and mass can be understood by intrinsic effects and extrinsic effects .",
    "intrinsic effects are those determined by the initial condition of galaxy formation and extrinsic effects are those in effect during the evolution of galaxies after formation",
    ".    the environmental dependence can be partly understood by the intrinsic effect called `` galaxy formation bias '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) where high density regions should have started off from the largest initial density fluctuations that collapse first in the universe , and galaxy formation takes place earliest in such regions and subsequent evolution is prompted . in lower density regions , however , galaxy formation is delayed and time scales of star formation and mass assembly are longer .",
    "likewise , the mass dependence of galaxy formation called `` down - sizing '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be partly understood by the scaled - down version of the bias on galactic scale , where more massive galaxies today correspond to higher initial density fluctuations on galactic scale and their formation such as star formation and assembly of building blocks take place earlier than less massive galaxies .",
    "galaxies are also subject to external effects from their surrounding environments , such as galaxy - galaxy interactions / mergers and ram - pressure stripping in dense environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) . such interactions may enhance and/or quench the star formation activity in galaxies preferentially in high density regions , which would therefore result in conspicuous dependence of galaxy properties on environments .    however , the relative importance of the intrinsic effects and the extrinsic effects is almost totally unknown yet .",
    "one of the most effective methods to verify the existence of the intrinsic effects is to go back in time and directly see the galaxies in the distant universe . by doing so",
    ", we may eventually reach the epoch when galaxies are forming rapidly in the biased cluster core , while galaxies are not yet formed or only slowly forming in lower density regions . also ,",
    "as we go back in time , host galaxies of star formation would be shifted to higher mass systems and we may eventually see the active star formation in action in massive galaxies in the cluster core .    in the low redshift universe ,",
    "star formation activity is a monotonically decreasing function of local density .",
    "however , we have not yet known the dependence of star formation activity on environments at high redshifts in detail . according to recent studies",
    ", it seems that star formation is in fact biased at high density region at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite reported for the first time in the goods north / south surveys that at @xmath14 the galaxies at denser environment tend to have higher star formation rates ( sfrs ) , in contrast to the local universe . @xcite and @xcite also showed similar trends for [ oii ] emitters at @xmath14 in deep2 and cosmos surveys , respectively . at a slightly lower redshift , @xmath15 , based on the mid - infrared observation of the rx  j1716.4 + 6708 cluster",
    ", @xcite reported that the star formation activity is probably enhanced in the medium density region , such as cluster outskirts or galaxy groups , rather than in the highest density region .",
    "@xcite also suggested that sfrs of galaxies may have a peak at intermediate densities at @xmath16=0.40.8 based on the ediscs survey .",
    "these observational findings may imply that the environment that hosts active star formation is shifted towards denser regions at higher redshifts .",
    "on the other hand , it is well - known as the `` butcher - oemler ( b - o ) effect '' that more distant clusters show higher fraction of blue galaxies up to @xmath17 , suggesting the enhancement of star formation activity in higher-@xmath16 clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the fraction of blue galaxies decreases with cluster centric radius , and red galaxies still dominate in the core regions at @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such studies of the b - o effect in clusters have been extended up to @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of active galaxies in the central regions of clusters is higher at @xmath180.70.9 compared to @xmath180.20.5 .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the fraction of galaxies with strong [ oii ] emission in the cluster cores at @xmath19 is not significantly dependent on redshift .",
    "it thus seems that we have not yet reached a bursting phase of massive galaxy formation in cluster cores even at @xmath14 , although the global activity of star formation within clusters is already enhanced .    in this paper",
    ", we present an [ oii ] emitter survey of the xmmxcs  j2215.9 - 1738 cluster ( hereafter 2215 cluster ) with a narrow - band filter @xmath1 on suprime - cam ( figure [ fig;transmission ] ) , and discuss spatial distribution of star formation activity ( see also @xcite , which presents our h@xmath20 emitter survey of the rx  j1716.4 + 6708 cluster at @xmath15 ) .",

    "our @xmath1 filter thus perfectly matches this cluster , and should be able to detect all the [ oii ] emission lines from the cluster members to a certain flux limit without introducing any bias ( figure [ fig;transmission ] ) . therefore , our survey is unique , and the 2215 cluster is an ideal target for us to investigate the environmental dependence of star formation activity over a wide range in environment at this high redshift .",

    "figure [ fig;oii_fraction ] suggests that the 2215 cluster maintains a high fraction of star forming galaxies in the central region , @xmath73% , even at the most inner part within 0.25  mpc in physical scale ( 1=0.51mpc at @xmath0 ) .",
    "this fraction is higher than the [ oii ] fraction in the cluster cores in @xcite , which is @xmath74% at @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite recently reported a distribution of spectroscopic sample of [ oii ] emitters in a cluster xmmu  j2235.3 - 2557 at @xmath75 , a similar redshift to that of the 2215 cluster . while there are no galaxies in the very core within 90  kpc in radius that show star forming activity , [ oii ] lines",
    "are detected from more than half of galaxies near the centre .",
    "this result is similar to ours on the [ oii ] emitters in 2215 cluster at a similar ( slightly higher ) redshift of 1.46 .",
    "it seems likely that distant x - ray detected clusters at @xmath76 are actively forming new stars even in the central region within a few hundreds kpc in radius .",
    "we have recently conducted a narrow - band h@xmath20 emitter survey for rx  j1716.4 + 6708 cluster at @xmath16=0.81 ( @xcite in preparation ) .",
    "this survey reveals quite a different situation where no h@xmath20 emitters are observed in the core region within a radius of 0.25  mpc ( figure [ fig;1716 ] ) .",
    "a difference in spatial distribution of the emitters is very impressive .",
    "the h@xmath20 emitters in the 1716 cluster are selected with a combination of @xmath77 ( @xmath2 = 11885 , @xmath3=141 ) and @xmath6 filters on subaru / moircs .",
    "the h@xmath20 survey reached to the depth of a limiting line flux of @xmath124.1@xmath3210@xmath55 erg s@xmath56 @xmath57 , which corresponds to a dust - free sfr of @xmath78m@xmath9yr@xmath56 .",
    "the h@xmath20 survey for the 1716 cluster is , thus , more sensitive to star forming galaxies with slightly lower sfr than the [ oii ] survey for the 2215 cluster , presented in this paper .    although the lines are different between the two clusters , h@xmath20 and [ oii ] lines , considering the fact that h@xmath20 line is much less affected by dust extinction than [ oii ] line , the intrinsic difference in spatial distribution of the emitters would be more significant .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that the fraction of star forming galaxies decreases as one goes to denser region , which is different from what we see for the 2215 cluster .",
    "similar trends are also found in lower redshift clusters at @xmath16=0.40.8 ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have also unveiled the star forming activities hidden by dust in the 1716 cluster based on the mid - infrared imaging with akari .",
    "these studies conclude that star formation activity has already been quenched in the cluster core , while it comes to an peak in the medium density regions away from the cluster core .",
    "these facts may imply that we find galaxy formation bias in the highest density region at @xmath79 .",
    "recent studies also support the biased star formation in a relatively dense environment at @xmath80 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference of critical environments in star formation at various redshifts may suggest that galaxy formation bias plays an important role in the dependence of galaxy properties on environments .",
    "in such a comparison between different clusters at different redshifts , we must keep in mind that the size and mass of the clusters can be different .",
    "in fact , the bolometric x - ray luminosity of 1716 cluster is @xmath81 times larger than that of 2215 cluster ( @xcite ) . also , the sub - structures of 1716 cluster is more prominent ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can not therefore conclude whether the difference seen in spatial distribution is largely due to time evolution or due to different masses or characteristics .",
    "but it may be the case that we are witnessing the evolution in star forming activity in the core of high-@xmath16 clusters from @xmath79 to @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite report a diversity in distribution of h@xmath20 emitters in the cores of clusters at @xmath16=0.70.8 .",
    "two among their three clusters at similar redshifts show a decrease in h@xmath20 fraction toward the cluster centre , while the other cluster shows an opposite trend .",
    "this fact may imply that it is not only the star formation bias that causes the high fraction of [ oii ] emitters in the core of the 2215 cluster .",
    "it is thus crucial to observe more clusters at @xmath83 , and to evaluate to what extent the presence of star forming galaxies in the cluster core is a general property at @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath28 relation of the 2215 cluster suggests that it is possible that it experienced a merger event within the last few gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "this can be another possible reason for the high fraction of [ oii ] emitters , since the cluster merging event might cause an enhancement of star formation activity in galaxies in the cluster core .",
    "also , since the distribution of [ oii ] emitters is projected on celestial sphere , it may be possible that some member galaxies in the outskirt of the cluster happen to be seen in the direction to the cluster centre , which may result in apparent high fraction of [ oii ] emitters at the centre .",
    "however , the number density of galaxies in the outskirt is likely to be much lower than that of galaxies in the core region ( figure [ fig;bzk](b ) ) , and such projection effect would be small in the direction to the centre .",
    "it is also possible that an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) enhances [ oii ] line flux .",
    "recent studies suggest that a fraction of agns in clusters increases with redshifts .",
    "@xcite have found an overdensity of agns within a radius of 0.25  mpc in clusters at @xmath84 , and that the density of x - ray selected agns in clusters at @xmath85 is 0.102 arcmin@xmath86 , which is @xmath87 times larger than that of clusters at @xmath88 .",
    "it indicates that it is possible that 34 agns reside in the central 33.8 arcmin@xmath89 region of the 2215 cluster .",
    "@xcite also show a monotonous increase of agn fraction in clusters from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xcite report no obvious x - ray point source in the cluster core , although we can not completely exclude the presence of any point source .",
    "we thus consider that agn contribution is small .",
    "@xcite suggest that [ oii ] emitters in the red sequence tend to be agns , most commonly liners , and that [ oii ] line can be valid as an indicator of star formation activity only for blue galaxies .",
    "we find four red [ oii ] emitters with @xmath38 colours redder than @xmath92 ( see  [ sec;cmd ] and figure [ fig;cmd_lf](a ) ) , which are located near the centre ( figure [ fig;map_member ] )",
    ". even if all these red [ oii ] emitters are agns , the enhancement of galaxy activity in the core would be still valid , since the presence of agn is also a sign of activity .",
    "this would then provide us with the clues to understanding the influence of agns on the evolution of massive galaxies in the cluster core , such as quenching of star formation .",
    "it is essential therefore to obtain nir spectra of these four [ oii ] emitters in order to constrain the origin of the [ oii ] lines .      according to @xcite , [ oii ] line flux [ ergs",

    ", we use the empirical sfr calibration for [ oii ] parametrized in terms of the @xmath4-band luminosity developed by moustakas , kennicutt & tremonti ( 2006 ) for local star forming galaxies .",
    "the @xmath4-band luminosity was regarded as a proxy of stellar mass .",
    "they were aware that the mass - to - light ratios of star forming galaxies span a wide range and that the @xmath4-band luminosity would not be a perfect indicator of stellar mass .",
    "however , they empirically found that the amount of dust extinction and metallicity are correlated with the @xmath4-band luminosity ( see figure 16 in moustakas et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) .",
    "they also found that the correlation for star forming galaxies at 0.5@xmath24@xmath16@xmath241.5 is roughly consistent with that for local galaxies .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is a larger uncertainty in the derived sfr for individual galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "we apply their correction scheme of dust extinction to our [ oii ] emitters at @xmath0 .",
    "we infer the rest - frame @xmath4-band fluxes from the @xmath6-band fluxes and @xmath102 colours and use them to correct for dust extinction .",
    "figure [ fig;sfr_ew](a ) shows thus derived dust - corrected sfrs of our [ oii ] emitters as a function of distance from the cluster center .",
    "stellar masses of the [ oii ] emitters are estimated from @xmath7 total magnitudes using the equation given in @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the stellar masses for @xmath45-selected galaxies at @xmath103 using k20 survey data .",
    "mass to @xmath45-band luminosity ratio is derived from multi - wavelength data from @xmath104 to @xmath45 with @xcite imf ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relation is calibrated with @xmath105 colour , which can reduce the dispersion of derived stellar mass to @xmath106 .",
    "we also derive specific sfr by dividing sfr by stellar mass .",
    "figure [ fig;sfr_ew](b ) shows the specific sfrs for [ oii ] emitters as a function of radius from a centre .",
    "the observed equivalent width of an [ oii ] emission is also derived from [ oii ] line flux and continuum flux density ( equations ( [ eq;fline ] ) and ( [ eq;fcont ] ) ) .",
    "figure [ fig;sfr_ew](c ) shows the observed equivalent widths for the [ oii ] emitters as a function of radius from a centre .",
    "figure [ fig;sfr_ew ] suggests that star formation activities of the [ oii ] emitters in denser regions are as active as those in the outskirt of the cluster .",
    "the equivalent widths are not correlated with the position of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "these facts also suggest active star formation in the central region of the 2215 cluster . on the other hand , the specific sfrs may show a mild correlation in the sense that [ oii ] emitters at the inner regions tend to have lower specific sfrs .",
    "since the similar correlation is not seen in their sfrs , this is due to the fact that massive galaxies tend to reside near the centre of the cluster .",
    "this tendency may be due to the galaxy formation bias that massive galaxies are formed in the cluster core , or may be a result of efficient mass assembly due to merging that can be more effective in high density regions . figure [ fig;sfr_ew](b ) also shows that the red [ oii ] emitters tend to have lower specific sfrs",
    ". this may be because we underestimate their intrinsic sfrs due to the strong dust extinction for the red galaxies .",
    "otherwise , this may imply that these galaxies are just quenching their star formation activities .",

    "therefore the decrease in the number of the red galaxies is not driven by incompleteness . @xcite and @xcite also examine colour - magnitude diagrams , and find that there is a well defined cmr of red galaxies in the 2215 cluster . in @xcite , however",

    "this is consistent with our result .",
    "since all the cluster member candidates are plotted in figure [ fig;cmd_lf](a ) , some galaxies actually do not belong to the cluster . in order to correctly evaluate the deficit of the red galaxies , we derive the field - corrected @xmath7-band luminosity function in the central @xmath107 region by statistically subtracting the field contamination . the detection completeness is also corrected for as follows .",
    "artificial objects with gaussian profile are randomly generated and embedded in the raw @xmath7 image , and detection of these objects is conducted with the same manner as in  [ sec;selection_nbcatalogue ] .",

    "<S> we present an unbiased deep [ oii ] emission survey of a cluster xmmxcs  j2215.9 - 1738 at @xmath0 , the most distant cluster to date with a detection of extended x - ray emission . with wide - field optical and near - infrared cameras ( suprime - cam and moircs , </S>",
    "<S> respectively ) on subaru telescope , we performed deep imaging with a narrow - band filter @xmath1 ( @xmath2 = 9139 , @xmath3=134 ) as well as broad - band filters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . from the photometric catalogues , we have identified 44 [ oii ] emitters in the cluster central region of @xmath8 down to a dust - free star formation rate of 2.6 m@xmath9/yr ( 3@xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it is found that there are many [ oii ] emitters even in the central high density region . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the fraction of [ oii ] emitters to the cluster members as well as their star formation rates and equivalent widths stay almost constant with decreasing cluster - centric distance up to the cluster core . unlike clusters at lower redshifts ( @xmath11 ) where star formation activity is mostly quenched in their central regions , this higher redshift 2215 cluster shows its high star formation activity even at its centre , suggesting that we are beginning to enter the formation epoch of some galaxies in the cluster core eventually . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find a deficit of galaxies on the red sequence at magnitudes fainter than @xmath12@xmath13 on the colour - magnitude diagram . this break magnitude is brighter than that of lower redshift clusters , and it is likely that we are seeing the formation phase of more massive red galaxies in the cluster core at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> these results may indicate inside - out and down - sizing propagation of star formation activity in the course of cluster evolution .    </S>",
