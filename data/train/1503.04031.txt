    "a peierls transition being a distortion of the periodic lattice of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) crystal has been known for more than @xmath7 years @xcite .",
    "peierls theorem states that a 1d equally spaced chain with one electron per ion is unstable to the dimerization , i.e. , a more favorable configuration can be achieved if every ion moves closer to its one neighbor and further away from the other .",
    "this is a purely kinetic effect related with the nesting of the 1d brillouin zone .",
    "such dimerization involves charge and lattice degrees of freedom but a similar process can be observed in the spin - orbital models @xcite where the interaction within the orbital sector dimerize the spin order .",
    "such an effect was observed by a neutron scattering in the perovskite vanadate @xmath8 @xcite as theoretically described by horsch and coworkers @xcite .",
    "similarly , for an iridate triangular - lattice superconductor ir@xmath9pt@xmath10te@xmath11 the photoemission and model studies have revealed that an orbitally induced peierls effect governs the charge and orbital instability in this compound @xcite .",
    "a strict , 1d spin - orbital analog of the peierls dimerized state was found in @xmath12 @xcite , as shown by raman scattering measurements , where the dimerized spin state at low temperature is driven by the orbital fluctuations at high temperature .",
    "a quite different situation emerges when the orbital fluctuation do not drive the spins dimerization but the orbital order makes the electrons hopping quasi-1d so that the classical peierls transition can occur @xcite .",
    "such an orbital - selective peierls dimerization was found in the @xmath13 spinel @xmath14 by an optical measurements . on the other hand",
    "it was shown that the notion of the peierls instability also applies to the strongly interacting electrons coupled to the phonons within the holstein model @xcite which allows to explain the orbital order in the undoped manganite @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "spin - orbital models are crucial from the point of view of frustrated magnetism @xcite as the orbital interactions , being typically of lower symmetry than the su(2)-symmetric spin interactions , can lead to frustration in both sectors even on a square lattice .",
    "this often happens in the transition - metal oxides .",
    "when the @xmath16 orbitals are partly filled , electrons localize due to large on - site coulomb interaction and superexchange between magnetic ions includes both spin and orbital degrees of freedom that are strongly interrelated @xcite .",
    "the orbital degeneracy leads then in many cases to a dramatic increase of quantum fluctuations @xcite , which may trigger exotic order @xcite , or may stabilize a spin - liquid @xcite when different states compete near a quantum critical point . in general",
    "these fluctuations make the ground - states of the spin - orbital models entangled , as it happens in the archetypal kugel - khomskii model in one- , two- , three - dimensional and bilayer cases , respectively @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath17 su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) chain @xcite , both ground state @xcite and excited states @xcite are entangled and the @xmath18 su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) chain which plays a prominent role in the vanadium perovskites @xcite . in exceptional cases",
    "can such 1d models be solved exactly , for example at the su(4 ) point @xcite or for a valence - bond state @xcite of alternating spin and orbital singlets similar to the majumdar - ghosh state in a 1d @xmath19-@xmath20 spin chain @xcite , but even in these situations the spins and orbitals can not be separated from each other .    in real materials",
    "the symmetry between spin and orbital interactions is absent .",
    "orbital interactions generically have lower symmetry than spin ones @xcite , being usually ising- or xy - like @xcite .",
    "the xy case is quantum and in general the orbitals can not be separated from the spins @xcite . therefore the 1d su(2)@xmath1xy model introduced by kumar @xcite is very exceptional because ; ( @xmath21 ) it is exactly solvable and ( @xmath22 ) by a change of basis , the @xmath17 spins decouple from the orbitals in an _ open _ chain .",
    "the orbital interactions remain formally unchanged but the spin ones are gauged away .",
    "the spins then appear free and the ground state has large degeneracy ( @xmath23 for chain length @xmath24 ) @xcite .    quite surprisingly , the properties of the kumar model are determined by topology .",
    "when the chain is closed and the model becomes periodic the exact solution still exists , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the spins can no longer be gauged away completely .",
    "contrarily , the gauge is accumulated on the closing orbital bond so that the whole spin sector enters the orbital problem only through the boundary condition , in analogy to aharonov - bohm magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "this partially lifts the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state of the open chain and splits the manifold of the @xmath23 states into a multiplet of low - lying states .",
    "these are the states with topological excitations of a non - local nature having quadratic dispersion in the total quasimomentum carried by the spins @xcite .",
    "such a multiplet of states connected by the non - local excitations is a characteristic feature of another model originating from the orbital exchange , namely the two - dimensional orbital compass model ( ocm ) @xcite , which was considered , iter alia , in the context of topologically protected qubits @xcite .",
    "from this point of view it was important to study how the small admixture of the su(2 ) heisenberg interactions , which is unavoidable in the physical implementations employing arrays of josephson junctions , will modify the multiplet structure in ocm @xcite .    in this paper we will study the spin - orbital kumar model with an extra antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg term for the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spins , namely the kumar - heisenberg ( kh ) model .",
    "as we will see further on , this model is no longer exactly solvable but the kumar gauge transformation can be still applied . as a result",
    "the pure kumar term gets completely or partially decoupled depending on the topology of the system but the heisenberg term is subject to the spin permutation that depends on the configuration of orbitals in their canonical basis . in other words , under the transformation the nn spin interaction gets smeared out and this smearing is governed by the delocalization of the up / down orbitals caused by the quantumness of the xy orbital interactions .",
    "this situation is interesting because in this way the spin interactions can get frustrated - the smeared interaction remains af but now the further neighbors are involved . on the other hand , as the pure kumar model leaves the spins practically completely uncorrelated , we expect that any small admixture of spin interactions @xmath6 will order the spins in some way . this is a favorable situation as it will enable us to use perturbation expansion in the manifold of degenerate ground - states of pure kumar model .",
    "to examine the region , where the coupling between the spins can not be treated as a small perturbation , we use the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) @xcite , which gives an accurate description of the ground state in one dimension .",
    "this also provides an independent way to verify the perturbational results .",

    "on the other hand we show that the dimerization of orbitals for large @xmath6 can be understood be a mean field mechanism in the physical basis .",
    "we have seen that the perturbative expansion in the kumar basis , however useful for understanding the spin dimerization , fails to capture the second - order phase transition found by dmrg in the thermodynamic limit . whereas the perturbative prediction is always a discontinuous transition ,",
    "the numerical study of the system of sizes up to @xmath100 allowed us to observe the divergence of the block entropy , vanishing of the gap and the dimerization order parameter in the regime where we approach the transition point at @xmath2 _ slower _ than the gap in the pure kumar model closes , i.e. , in the regime where the perturbative approach must fail .",
    "finally , by observing that the spin correlation length is strongly increased as @xmath6 grows we have deduced that there is another phase transition in the limit of @xmath5 ( or equivalently @xmath163 ) .",
    "this we have confirmed by the finite - size scaling of the block entropy for decreasing @xmath161 .",
    "the phase diagram is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] .",
    "finally we note that however the full dimerization in orbital space can be easily understood by the mean - field approach , similarly as it was done for yvo@xmath179 @xcite at finite temperature , but here in zero temperature , the spin dimerization is more complex and its mechanism can be revealed only by the kumar transformation .",
    "this is a novel feature that was not found in the similar spin - orbital models , namely su(2)@xmath1xy @xcite and su(2)@xmath1su(2 ) @xcite one , where in principle the dimerization could be captured by a simple variational wave functions in the physical basis and confirmed via dmrg .",
    "we argue that such a novel dimerization can be observed in the ( quasi ) one - dimensional compounds with active spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",

    "the diagonal block @xmath190 originates from pnnc s between spins on empty sites . since only a pair of consecutive empty sites can happen to be nn s , the block couples only nn s .",
    "the weakest coupling @xmath191 originates from the relatively rare situation when the first and last empty sites happen to be also respectively the first and last sites of the chain , i.e. , they are not only nn s ( across the closing bond ) but also each of them occupies a definite position .",

    "the two diagonal blocks are the same .",
    "the two identical off - diagonal blocks originate from pnnc s between pairs of empty and occupied sites .",
    "the top values of the coupling are between the first and the last site : @xmath194 for @xmath103 and @xmath195 for @xmath181 .",
    "this strong coupling originates from the pnnc between the @xmath50-th empty and the @xmath50-th occupied site that are very likely to be next to each other . the coupling @xmath196 originates from the pnnc between the @xmath50-th empty and the @xmath46-st occupied site that is possible mainly across the closing bond .",
    "this coupling is much weaker for an open chain where the @xmath50-th empty and @xmath46-st occupied sites are rather unlikely to be nn .",
    "however , the dominant feature of each off - diagonal block is its antidiagonal belt .",
    "a coupling @xmath197 within this belt originates from a pnnc between @xmath21-th empty and @xmath198-th occupied site with @xmath21 close to @xmath198 .",
    "these sites are most likely to be nn when their difference @xmath199 is not much greater than a variation of a position of the @xmath21-th empty ( or the @xmath198-th occupied ) site in the fermi sea .",
    "this variation limits the width of the antidiagonal belt .",
