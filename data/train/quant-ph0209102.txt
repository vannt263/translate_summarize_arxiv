    "the rabi hamiltonian plays an important role in quantum optics .",
    "it describes a two - level atom interacting with a single mode of quantized electromagnetic radiation via a dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "it also finds wider application , describing a spin interacting with phonons in nmr @xcite , for example .",
    "it is also related to the static lee model in field theory @xcite .",
    "the field mode is described by bosonic annihilation and creation operators , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , which obey the usual commutation relation , @xmath2 = 1.\\ ] ] the two - level atom is described by the pseudo - spin operators @xmath3 @xmath4 with these definitions the rabi hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 there is a conserved parity @xmath6 associated with the hamiltonian , @xmath7    there is no proof that this hamiltonian is integrable , although suggestive evidence does exist @xcite .",
    "consequently , investigation of the rabi system requires approximations to be made .",
    "the most widely used approach is to make the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "this was first applied by jaynes and cummings @xcite , yielding the jaynes ",
    "cummings model . under the rwa ,",
    "one neglects the `` virtual terms '' @xmath8 and @xmath9 , also known as the counter - rotating terms .",
    "this leads to the excitation number @xmath10 as well as parity @xmath6 being conserved , and renders the model soluble by a series of @xmath11 diagonalisations .    despite its frequent use in quantum optics the actual validity of the rwa for specific applications",
    "is usually highly questionable .",
    "for example , we know @xcite that the energy spectrum of the rabi hamiltonian can be approximated by its jc counterpart in the rwa only for sufficiently small values of the coupling strength @xmath12 , and that the width of this range decreases as one proceeds higher up the spectrum .",
    "there is a further concern regarding the rwa .",
    "ford and oconnell @xcite investigated the system of a charged harmonic oscillator interacting with a reservoir consisting of an infinite number of oscillators within the rwa .",
    "they showed that the spectrum has no lower bound for all models of physical interest .",
    "this constitutes a violation of the second law of thermodynamics , as we can take energy from the oscillator bath ( modeling the environment ) without producing an effect upon it , i.e. , we can still remove an infinite amount of energy from it",
    ".    the energy level spectrum of the full hamiltonian has been investigated by several authors .",
    "the simplest approach is to use the configuration - interaction ( ci ) method , equivalent to a large - scale diagonalisation in a suitably defined finite subspace of the full hilbert space .",
    "this method has been used both by graham and hhnerbach @xcite and by ku @xcite in investigating possible quantum chaos signatures of the model .",
    "_ @xcite have given an analysis of the validity of the ci method .",
    "reik and others @xcite have adapted judd s method @xcite for the jahn - teller system for use with the rabi hamiltonian . here",
    ", the hamiltonian is translated into the bargmann representation @xcite and solutions of the resulting differential equations are sought . whereas judd originally used a power series ansatz",
    ", reik uses a neumann series . for certain couplings",
    ", the neumann series terminates , giving isolated , exact solutions known as juddian solutions . elsewhere",
    "the series gives a useful , convergent approximation .",
    "the juddian points are valuable for comparison of approximate techniques .",
    "variational results have also been provided by bishop _",
    "_ @xcite and by benivegna and messina @xcite .",
    "the latter method also permits perturbative corrections , allowing the exact results to be approached .",
    "the time evolution of the rabi hamiltonian has been of considerable interest for a long time .",
    "we mention in particular the pioneering studies of shirley @xcite .",
    "somewhat later , eberly and co - workers @xcite were the first to fully demonstrate the rich time evolution of this model .",
    "they worked within the rwa and discovered the collapse - revival nature of the subsequent evolution when the system is started from a coherent field @xcite .",
    "the impact of the non - rwa terms on the time evolution has been investigated using various techniques .",
    "for example , zaheer and zubairy have used path - integral methods @xcite , while several authors have used perturbative techniques @xcite .",
    "the drawback of these latter methods is their restriction to small coupling .",
    "finally , swain has given formally exact result for the time evolution of the rabi hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , the solutions are expressed as continued fractions , which limits their usefulness in practice .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate the evolution of the rabi system from an initial state composed of an empty field mode and an unexcited atom , which we denote as @xmath13 and henceforth call the unexcited vacuum state . within the rwa",
    ", the system would remain in this state indefinitely .",
    "however , inclusion of the counter - rotating terms means that we allow `` energy non - conserving '' processes to occur .",
    "it is these virtual processes that drive the evolution of the system . for simplicity",
    ", we shall only consider the resonant case , @xmath14 .    in order to investigate the evolution of the rabi system from the state @xmath15 we employ here one of the most versatile and most accurate semi - analytical formalisms of microscopic quantum many - body theory , namely the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) [ 2330 ] .",
    "coupled cluster techniques are widely regarded as being amongst the most powerful of all _ ab initio _",
    "quantum many - body methods . as such",
    "they provide a number of distinct advantages over more traditional or more specialised methods which have hitherto been used in quantum optics and allied fields and , more specifically , to study rabi systems .",
    "the ccm exists in two versions , the so - called normal ( nccm ) and extended ( eccm ) types @xcite , and in the present paper we employ only the former version .",
    "a particular advantage of the ccm , a nonperturbative method originally developed in nuclear physics by coester and kmmel @xcite , is that it has been extremely widely applied and tested on a huge variety of physical systems @xcite .",
    "these include areas as diverse as nuclear and subnuclear physics , quantum field theories ( both in the spatial continuum and on the spatial lattice ) , condensed matter physics , quantum magnetism , and quantum chemistry . in almost all such cases ccm techniques",
    "now provide numerical results that are either the best or among the best available .",
    "a pertinent , but quite typical , example is the electron gas , one of the most intensely studied of all quantum many - body problems . here",
    ", the ccm results @xcite for the correlation energy , for example , agree over the entire metallic density range to within less than one millihartree per electron ( or @xmath16 ) with the essentially exact greens s function monte carlo results that are , very exceptionally , available for this fermionic system .",
    "the ccm results have never been bettered by any other technique .",
    "elsewhere , in quantum chemistry , for example , after its early introduction by iek @xcite , the influence of the ccm has been profound , to the point where it it nowadays the method of choice for most highly accurate chemical studies @xcite .",
    "since the rabi hamiltonian involves a two - level system which is modeled by pauli pseudospin operators , we note finally that the ccm has also been very successfully applied to a large number of spin - lattice systems exhibiting anti - ferromagnetic and other forms of magnetic ordering . in instances such as unfrustrated models on bipartite lattices where a marshall - peierls sign rule @xcite exists ( which provides a means to circumvent the infamous `` minus - sign problem '' inherent in simulating many - fermion systems by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques ) , the ccm provided results fully comparable in accuracy with those obtained by qmc means @xcite .",
    "the ccm is even able to predict with good accuracy the positions of the phase boundaries which mark the quantum phase transitions between states of different quantum order .",
    "furthermore , the ccm provides equally accurate results for systems which are frustrated either geometrically ( e.g. , on a triangular lattice ) @xcite , or dynaimically ( e.g. , by competing interactions on different bonds on the lattice ) @xcite , where qmc methods are much more difficult to apply . in several such instances",
    "the ccm results are now the best available .",
    "although the time - dependent formalism of the ccm @xcite has existed for a considerable time , it has not yet found the same range of applications as its static counterpart .",
    "for example , hoodbhoy and negele @xcite have investigated the application of the technique in nuclear dynamics , using two interacting lipkin hamiltonian systems as a test model .",
    "it has also found more application in chemical physics @xcite .",
    "for example , monkhorst has outlined the application of the time - dependent ccm to the treatment of molecular eigenstates @xcite , with the aim to describe such phenomena as scattering , chemical dynamics , and laser chemistry .",
    "sree latha and durga prasad have investigated the application of the technique to multi - mode systems with vibronic coupling @xcite , a mechanism describing , amongst other things , non - adiabatic phenomena in the electronic spectroscopy of polyatomic molecules .",
    "we note that all of these studies have tended to only use the lowest levels of ccm approximation , due to the complexity of the systems studied . in comparison",
    ", we shall use high levels of approximation in an endevour to describe the rabi system as accurately as possible .    for other applications of the ccm the interested reader",
    "is referred to the reviews contained in refs .",
    "an important feature of all the applications is that the results provided by the ccm are able to be systematically improved upon via well - defined hierachies of approximations . at each level of approximation",
    "the results are open to ready physical interpretation in terms of the correlated many - body clusters involved and their corresponding multiconfigurational creation operators . to date the nccm has already been used to investigate the ground - state of the rabi hamiltonian @xcite , where it has been shown to give excellent results for values of the coupling parameter @xmath17 . in view of the demonstrable success in treating so many other many - body systems ,",
    "we now wish to apply it to the dynamical evolution of rabi systems , with a particular aim to shed light on the importance of the counter - rotating terms dropped in the commonly made rwa .",
    "we now briefly describe the application of the normal coupled cluster method to the rabi hamiltonian of interest to us here .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be the exact ket and bra states at time @xmath20 for an arbitrary many - body quantum mechanical system , chosen so that @xmath21 the hilbert space for our system may be described in terms of a model state or cyclic vector @xmath22 and a corresponding complete set of mutually commuting multiconfigurational creation operators @xmath23 .",
    "the set @xmath23 is defined with respect to the reference state , such that @xmath24 , in a notation in which @xmath25 , the identity operator . in general",
    ", @xmath26 is a set index and the operators @xmath27 contain products of single - particle operators .",
    "the set index @xmath28 is complete in the sense that the set of states @xmath29 provides a complete basis for the hilbert space .",
    "the reference state , @xmath22 , must be chosen to be non - orthogonal to the actual wavefunction of the system , @xmath30    usually one chooses @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is some suitably defined kronecker symbol .",
    "however , our later choice of @xmath33 will leave the set @xmath29 orthogonal but not normalised ; @xmath34    the ket and bra states are formally parametrized independently in the normal coupled cluster method as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a _ c_-number . using this parametrization ,",
    "the expectation value of an arbitrary operator , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 , we use the nested commutator relation , @xmath40 + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left[\\left[\\hat{x},\\hat{s}\\right]\\hat{s}\\right ] + \\cdots~. \\label{bchreln}\\ ] ] this equation describes a similarity transformation of the operator @xmath38 .",
    "the similarity transformed hamiltonian , @xmath41 , lies at the heart of the coupled cluster method.the ability of the nccm to describe the rabi stationary ground state has been investigated elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we shall only consider the time - dependent formalism . to this end",
    ", we introduce the action functional @xmath42 the stationarity principle , @xmath43 for all independent variations in the bra and ket states such that @xmath44 , reproduces the time - dependent schrdinger equations , @xmath45 equation ( [ stationp ] ) gives hamilton s equations of motion for the cluster coefficients , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the norm from eq .",
    "( [ cnorm ] ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite we make the following choice of reference state and operators , @xmath48 with @xmath49 the corresponding expansion for @xmath50 is @xmath51 with @xmath52    we note that the states @xmath53 and @xmath54 are eigenstates of the excitation operator , @xmath10 with eigenvalues equal to @xmath55 .",
    "they have corresponding even or odd parity ( i.e. eigenvalues of @xmath6 equal to @xmath56 or @xmath57 , respectively ) depending on whether @xmath55 is even or odd .",
    "the reference state @xmath22 has positive parity .",
    "this is the same as the ground - state , as demanded by eq.([phipsi ] ) .",
    "the overlaps , @xmath47 , of the operators ( [ sdefns ] ) are @xmath58 this choice of reference state and cluster operators has been found to predict a spurious phase transition at @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this in fact signals a breakdown of the calculation for @xmath60 . for @xmath61",
    "this scheme gives excellent results for the ground state , and so it is within this region that we shall work .",
    "we shall start the system in the unexcited vacuum , @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to the initial , @xmath62 , conditions @xmath63 other choices are certainly possible , but the above choice is the most obvious one that corresponds to a physical state and which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ phipsi ] ) .    in the evaluation of the time evolution equations",
    "we truncate the sums in eqs .",
    "( [ sdefns ] ) and ( [ stildefns ] ) at @xmath64 , giving the so - called sub-@xmath10 approximation , in which all the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 are set to zero .",
    "the resulting set of coupled equations ( [ sevol ] ) is then solved numerically by taking finite time - steps .",
    "we note that since the initial state @xmath68 has even parity @xmath6 , all the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 vanish identically for odd values of @xmath55 , at all times .",
    "the convergence of our method with decreasing step size is demonstrated in table [ table1 ] . naively , one would expect a similar type of convergence with increasing sub-@xmath10 level .",
    "adding more cluster operators should allow the actual wavefunction to be described more accurately .",
    "however , we find that this is only the case for small coupling , as shown in table [ table2 ] .",
    "in general we find that for a given coupling parameter , @xmath12 , there is a maximal value of the truncation index @xmath10 for which convergence occurs . for higher values of @xmath10",
    "the method diverges , with the calculated cluster coefficients diverging to infinity . to understand this behaviour",
    "we look at the energy spectrum calculated by the nccm under this scheme .",
    "this spectrum is determined by first calculating the ground - state coefficients , @xmath69 , and using these to construct the so - called dynamic matrix , @xmath70 of linear response theory @xcite .",
    "this matrix is then diagonalised to give the energy eigenvalues",
    ". a full discussion of this procedure would take us too far afield and so we shall just consider the results and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for further information .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the excitation energies as determined by a sub-4 calculation .",
    "a sub-@xmath10 calculation yields 4@xmath10 eigenvalues , half of which are spurious negative energy solutions , generated as a result of the symmetry of @xmath70 .    .",
    "convergence of the method with decreasing step - size .",
    "the values of the real and imaginary parts of two typical coefficients are shown at time @xmath71 , for a sub-12 calculation with @xmath72 .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the initial aim of applying the nccm to the rabi hamiltonian was to produce an accurate microscopic description of the time evolution of the system across the whole coupling range .",
    "this has however not been completely realized due to the incursion of complex energies in the nccm spectrum .",
    "similar problems occur in the ground - state description .",
    "the underlying reasons for this failure of the nccm are not yet entirely clear to us , and will merit further study .",
    "however , it does seem likely that the existence of the juddian points , at which level crossings occur , indicates the presence of a subtle symmetry whose preservation or breaking is not reflected in our simple choice of reference state . it should be noted that although van der walt @xcite has tried a number of different reference states and operator selections , none of these has yet entirely solved this problem .",
    "future work includes analysis of the rabi hamiltonian with the nccm in the holomorphic representation , and an extension of the above method to evolution from a coherent state .",
