    "we briefly summarize the experimental setup and data calibration procedures employed in this work . for additional details we refer to @xcite , which used the same setup as the work described here .",
    "ki was a fringe - tracking long baseline near - ir michelson interferometer that combined light from the two 10-m keck apertures @xcite .",
    "each of the 10-m apertures was equipped with a natural guide star adaptive optics ( ngs - ao ) system that corrected phase errors caused by atmospheric turbulence across each telescope pupil , and thereby maintained spatial coherence of the light from the source across each aperture .",
    "we used the `` self phase referencing '' ( spr ) mode of ki @xcite , which was implemented as a precursor to the dual - field phase referencing mode @xcite . in spr",
    "a servo loop used the phase information measured on the primary ( continuum ) channel to stabilize the atmospheric phase motions , and enabled longer integration times on the secondary ( spectrally - dispersed ) channel .",
    "for the spectrally - dispersed channel we used integration times between 0.5 and 2 s , approximately 1,000 times longer than possible with the uncorrected primary side .",
    "the spectrally - dispersed channel included a grism that , used in first - order , passed the entire @xmath1-band with a dispersion of @xmath18 .",
    "this spectral resolution was confirmed with measurements of a neon lamp spectrum .",
    "note , however , that the lines were not fully nyquist sampled with our detector ; spectra were nyquist sampled at a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "neon lamp spectra and/or fourier transform spectroscopy were also used to determine the wavelength scale for each night of observed data .",
    "while the entire @xmath1-band fell on the detector , vignetting in the camera led to lower throughput toward the band edges .",
    "the effective bandpass of our observations is approximately 2.05 to 2.35 @xmath9 m . in this paper",
    "we focus on two sub - regions of the @xmath1-band : one centered on the br@xmath2 feature at 2.1662 @xmath9 m , and one including the first two co overtone bandheads , at 2.2936 @xmath9 m and 2.3227 @xmath9 m .",
    "the third co overtone bandhead at 2.3527 @xmath9 m is included in the ki bandpass , but in the lower - throughput edge region .",
    "we therefore exclude it from the analysis below .",
    "we obtained keck interferometer ( ki ) observations of our sample during 9 nights between april 2008 and november 2011 ( see table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "when observing our sample , targets were interleaved with calibrators every 1015 minutes .",
    "we used the count rates in each spectral channel observed during `` foreground integrations '' , corrected for biases @xcite , to recover crude spectra for our targets .",
    "these spectra were measured when no fringes were present , and include all flux measured within the @xmath20 mas diameter of the instrumental field of view .",
    "we divided the measured flux versus wavelength for our targets by the observed fluxes from the calibrator stars , using calibrator scans nearest in time to given target scans , and then multiplied the results by nextgen template spectra @xcite suitable for the spectral types of the calibrators .",
    "all calibrators have spectral types earlier than k2 ( table [ tab : sample ] ) , where nextgen models are well - matched to empirical stellar spectra . for our calibration procedure",
    "we prefer nextgen templates to observed stellar spectra , because it is easier to compile a grid of photospheric spectra that is densely sampled in spectral type .",
    "instrumental scattered or thermal background light could add continuum emission to the ki data , leading to observed line - to - continuum ratios lower than intrinsic spectral features . to test for such effects , we compared observed and theoretical spectra for several of our main - sequence calibrator stars .",
    "figure [ fig : checkstar ] demonstrates that the observed photospheric br@xmath2 absorption in these `` check stars '' is consistent with theoretical expectations , across a range of source colors and brightnesses ( see table [ tab : sample ] for spectral types and magnitudes ) .",
    "thus the br@xmath2 spectra derived from the ki data do not seem to be affected substantially by instrumental scattering or background emission .",
    "since co overtone emission occurs in the red end of the @xmath1-band , where thermal emission is stronger , uncorrected background emission may be more significant for co than for the br@xmath2 region .",
    "two of the check stars , hd 144841 and hd 184152 , are expected to show some co overtone absorption .",
    "the observed absorption features appear weaker than expected from the synthetic spectra ( figure [ fig : checkstar ] ) .",
    "the largest discrepancy is seen for hd 184152 , one of the faintest objects observed with ki .",
    "uncorrected background emission would be relatively stronger for fainter objects , consistent with this observation .",
    "thus , some caution is required when interpreting the co overtone emission or absorption features in the ki spectra , particularly for fainter targets .",
    "we measured squared visibilities ( @xmath21 ) for our targets and calibrator stars in each of the 330 spectral channels across the @xmath1-band provided by the grism .",
    "the calibrator stars are main sequence stars , with known parallaxes , whose @xmath1 magnitudes are within 0.5 mags of the target @xmath1 magnitudes ( table [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "we calculated the system visibility appropriate to each target scan by weighting the calibrator data by the internal scatter and the temporal and angular proximity to the target data @xcite . for comparison",
    ", we also computed the straight average of the @xmath21 for all calibrators used for a given source , and the system visibility for the calibrator observations closest in time .",
    "these methods all produce results consistent within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "we adopt the first method in our analysis .",
    "phases are measured in each spectral channel using the same `` abcd '' procedure @xcite used to determine @xmath21 .",
    "these phases are then de - rotated so that the average phase of all channels is zero .",
    "next , the phases versus wavelength are unwrapped to eliminate any jumps between -180@xmath22 and 180@xmath22 . after computing weighted average differential phases for each target and calibrator scan ,",
    "we determine a `` system differential phase '' using similar weighting employed above to calculate the system visibility .",
    "the system differential phase is subtracted from the target differential phase . since targets and calibrators",
    "are observed at similar airmasses , this calibration procedure removes most atmospheric and instrumental refraction effects .",
    "finally , we remove any residual slope in the differential phase spectrum , since we can not distinguish instrumental slopes from those intrinsic to the target signal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since we are focused on small spectral regions around individual spectral features , we are largely insensitive to errors in these calibrations .",
    "the measured fluxes , @xmath21 , and differential phases contain contributions from the circumstellar material and from the central stars . to remove the central star",
    ", we first estimate its flux in each observed spectral channel using stellar parameters from the literature ( see table [ tab : sample ] ) and a suitable nextgen synthetic spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectra are subtracted from the observed ki spectra to produce circumstellar fluxes for each spectral channel .",
    "circumstellar fluxes ( @xmath23 ) , visibilities ( @xmath24 ) , and differential phases ( @xmath25 ) are given by the following equations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath26 @xmath27 ,    \\label{eq : dpcirc}\\ ] ] @xmath28 these equations imply that even if a spectral feature is not apparent in the observed spectrum , its presence may be implied in the circumstellar emission .",
    "for example , late - type stars have photospheric co overtone absorption .",
    "if no absorption is seen in the observed spectra of such objects , this implies that the photospheric absorption is filled in by circumstellar emission .",
    "one potential pitfall with this procedure is that the nextgen templates only cover stars up to 10,000 k , while the herbig be stars in our sample ( v1685 cyg , as 442 , and mwc 1080 ) have higher effective temperatures .",
    "such hot stars typically have shallower br@xmath2 absorption than cooler a stars , since the h ionization fraction in the stellar photosphere is higher .",
    "thus the circumstellar br@xmath2 spectra for these objects may underestimate the true line - to - continuum ratios .      for four of our sample objects , vv ser , as 353 a , v1685 cyg , and as 442 , we obtained nirspec data on 2011",
    "september 15 .",
    "we used the high - dispersion mode with the 3 pixel slit , which provides a resolving power of @xmath29 .",
    "the nirspec-7 filter was used with an echelle position of 62.25 and a cross - disperser position of 35.45 .",
    "this provided seven spectral orders covering portions of the wavelength range between 1.99 and 2.39 @xmath9 m .",
    "included in these orders are the br@xmath2 line and the @xmath30 and @xmath31 co bandheads .",
    "spectra were calibrated and extracted using the redspec package ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "reduction included mapping of spatial distortions , spectral extraction , wavelength calibration , heliocentric radial velocity corrections , bias correction , flat fielding , and sky subtraction .",
    "we divided our target spectra by the observed spectrum of hd 201320 , an a0v star .",
    "we interpolated the a0v spectrum over the broad br@xmath2 absorption feature .",
    "finally we multiplied the divided spectra by an appropriate blackbody template to calibrate the bandpass of the instrument .",
    "we did not attempt to flux calibrate the spectra , but instead applied scaling factors so that the nirspec data had the same mean flux level ( in a given spectral region ) as the ki spectra .",
    "in this section we present the calibrated ki and nirspec data , and discuss physical implications for the distribution of gaseous emission around our sample objects .",
    "we begin by comparing the ki spectra with our nirspec observations ( where available ) and previous data from the literature .",
    "we then use the observed @xmath21 and @xmath32 for our sample to derive estimates of the spatial distributions and centroid positions of the emission as a function of wavelength . as we discuss below",
    ", br@xmath2 emission is prevalent from the sample , while co overtone emission is relatively rare .",
    "we therefore present the results for the br@xmath2 and co spectral regions separately in sections [ sec : brgres ] and [ sec : cores ] .",
    "calibrated spectra from ki , observed and with the stellar components subtracted ( equation [ eq : fcirc ] ) , are shown for the br@xmath2 spectral region in figure [ fig : spectra ] . calibrated and scaled nirspec spectra",
    "are plotted in figure [ fig : nspec_brg ] .",
    "while the nirspec data have approximately 10 times higher spectral resolution than the ki data , the spatial resolution of the seeing - limited nirspec observations is @xmath33 times coarser .",
    "the nirspec data show higher line - to - continuum ratios for the br@xmath2 emission than do the ki data ( figure [ fig : nspec_brg ] ) .",
    "previous near - ir spectroscopy @xcite , with a spectral dispersion similar to the nirspec data presented here , also found line - to - continuum ratios of the br@xmath2 emission higher than seen in our ki data .",
    "the lower line - to - continuum ratios in the ki data are due , in part , to the lower spectral dispersion . with @xmath16 times higher dispersion ,",
    "the nirspec data suffer less dilution of strong spectral features .",
    "however the br@xmath2 lines are well - resolved , and dilution is only a minor effect ( figure [ fig : nspec_brg ] ) .",
    "the different fields of view of the two instruments may also play a role , with the larger field of view of nirspec potentially sensitive to spatially extended br@xmath2 emission outside of the 50 mas field of view of ki .",
    "br@xmath2 emission is seen on @xmath34 scales in some young stars , comprising up to 10% of the total br@xmath2 flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extrapolating this finding to scales between 50 mas and @xmath35 may explain the difference between the ki and nirspec spectra .",
    "we explore this issue quantitatively in section [ sec : modeling ] .    from the ki spectra",
    ", we compute the equivalent width of the br@xmath2 line for each source . following @xcite",
    ", we use these equivalent widths in conjunction with literature photometry and extinction estimates to determine the br@xmath2 line luminosities .",
    "these line luminosities are then converted into accretion luminosities using empirically - determined relationships for stars with masses @xmath36 m@xmath13 @xcite and @xmath37 m@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these relationships have not been calibrated beyond 6 m@xmath13 , and may not hold for the most massive herbig be stars in our sample , v1685 cyg and mwc 1080 .",
    "equivalent widths , br@xmath2 line luminosities , and accretion luminosities for our sample are listed in table [ tab : brg ] .",
    "in addition to spectra , we measured squared visibilities for our targets , which constrain the relative spatial distributions of continuum and line emission components .",
    "we fit the @xmath21 data for each source , in each channel , with a simple uniform ring model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to produce a `` spectral size distribution '' of the emission .",
    "the spectral size distributions based on the observed data , and for the circumstellar emission components ( equation [ eq : vdisk ] ) , are shown in figure [ fig : v2 ] .",
    "for the majority of the observed targets , we infer a distinct spatial distribution for br@xmath2 emission and continuum emission ( figure [ fig : v2 ] ) . to quantify the relative distributions ,",
    "we separate the complex visibility components due to the br@xmath2 line and the continuum , and fit each with uniform ring models ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "the estimated sizes for the two components are listed for our sample in table [ tab : brgsizes ] .",
    "the br@xmath2 emission is generally found in a significantly more compact distribution .",
    "however for as 353 a , v1685 cyg , and v1331 cyg , the inferred sizes for the line and continuum emission components are comparable . a few other objects ( including dg tau and do tau ) show br@xmath2 emission sizes that are a significant fraction of the continuum emission sizes .",
    "differential phase signatures in the ki data indicate centroid offsets of various line emission components .",
    "we convert the measured @xmath32 values into centroid offsets as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the observed wavelength and @xmath40 is the projected baseline length .",

    "centroid offsets are plotted in figure [ fig : dp ] for the br@xmath2 order .",
    "a number of targets show evidence for position offsets of different velocity components across the spectrally - resolved br@xmath2 line ( figure [ fig : dp ] ) .",
    "for example , in ry tau the red- and blue - shifted components of the emission have opposite ( and approximately equal ) position offsets .",
    "such a signature resembles expectations for a spatially resolved keplerian disk of emission .",
    "in contrast , mwc 275 shows a significant positional offset of only the red - shifted emission component , perhaps arguing for a bipolar infall where one lobe is ( partially ) obscured from view .",
    "we model these signatures quantitatively below in section [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "ki and nirspec spectra of our sample , covering the spectral region including the co overtone bandheads , are shown in figures [ fig : cospectra ] and [ fig : nspec_co ] .",
    "spectral size distributions , and centroid offsets across the co bandheads , are shown in figures [ fig : cov2 ] and [ fig : codp ] , respectively .",
    "of the 21 objects in our sample , only two  as 353 a and v1331 cyg  show strong co overtone emission .",
    "co emission has been observed previously for both of these ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the line - to - continuum ratio observed here for v1331 cyg is comparable to that seen in previous observations , including ones with similar resolution to the ki data @xcite",
    ". the line - to - continuum ratio of as 353 a in our ki and nirspec data is somewhat higher than seen in previous observations @xcite , although there does seem to be some variability in the co emission strength @xcite .",
    "in addition to as 353 a and v1331 cyg , a number of targets show tentative evidence of co overtone emission ( figure [ fig : cospectra ] ) .",
    "dg tau and do tau both exhibit circumstellar co emission features , although such features are absent in the calibrated ( star+circumstellar ) spectra .",
    "there are also hints of circumstellar co emission in dk tau a and gk tau , although the calibrated spectra show co absorption .",
    "thus , any inferred co emission in these objects depends on the accuracy of the removal of stellar co absorption .    in section [ sec :",
    "obs ] we suggested that co overtone absorption features in faint objects might appear weaker in observed spectra than their intrinsic values , perhaps because of uncorrected thermal background emission .",
    "dg tau , dk tau a , gk tau , and do tau are all among the faintest objects in the sample , where uncorrected background emission would have a larger effect .",
    "the small apparent co emission in dk tau a and gk tau is likely an artifact of the calibration process .",
    "however , dg tau is known to show co overtone emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the signal in do tau is fairly large .    given that as 353 a and v1331 cyg exhibit co emission at levels similar to ( or higher than ) previous observations , it seems improbable that the co features in do tau ( which is similarly faint to those targets ) could be completely spurious .",
    "however , any line enhancement arising from instrumental errors will affect the data strongly for do tau , because the ratio of stellar to circumstellar flux is high ( see equations [ eq : fcirc][eq : vdisk ] ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : cospectra ] , the stellar component is approximately the same brightness as the circumstellar component in the co spectral region . in contrast , errors for dg tau will be less severe , since its stellar flux is only a small fraction of its circumstellar flux ( figure [ fig : cospectra ] ) .",
    "v1685 cyg and as 442 also show weak co emission features , while mwc 275 shows apparent co overtone absorption in its circumstellar spectrum ( figure [ fig : cospectra ] ) .",
    "these are hot stars , and these tentative detections do not rely on accurate subtraction of the stellar photospheric spectra",
    ". however calibration artifacts ( e.g. , due to mismatches between observed and template spectra for late - type calibrators ) may be responsible for the apparent features .",
    "recent co overtone spectra of these sources show no features in as 442 or mwc 275 , but possible evidence for weak co emission in v1685 cyg @xcite .",
    "strong features seen in the @xmath21 and differential phase data for v1685 cyg ( figures [ fig : cov2 ] and [ fig : codp ] ) strengthen the case for real co emission in this source .",
    "we therefore discount the apparent co features in mwc 275 and as 442 , but include v1685 cyg in our further analysis of the co spectral region .",
    "for our analysis we select those objects with the most significant detections of co emission features .",
    "this sub - sample includes dg tau , do tau , as 353 a , v1685 cyg , and v1331 cyg .",
    "since the co detections for dg tau and do tau depend on the removal of the stellar photospheric spectrum , these should be treated with some caution .",
    "the detection rate in our sample , 5/21 , is similar to the detection rate in previous surveys for co overtone emission ( e.g. , 9/40 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for this sub - sample of co overtone emitters",
    ", we estimate the spectral size distribution in the co region .",
    "the continuum sizes in the co region ( table [ tab : cosizes ] ) may differ from those in the br@xmath2 region ( table [ tab : brgsizes ] ) .",
    "small , monotonic , changes with wavelength are expected ( for all targets ) if continuum emission arises in extended distributions of circumstellar matter exhibiting temperature gradients .",
    "these broadband slopes were modeled for many of our targets in previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however the observed @xmath21 for v1685 cyg show unusually large changes with wavelength , including a non - monotonic dependence .",
    "we illustrate this behavior in figure [ fig : v1685cyg ] , comparing v1685 cyg to as 442 , the latter representative of the spectral @xmath21 behavior across the sample .",
    "we do not have a clear explanation for the @xmath21 observed from v1685 cyg , but suggest below that binarity may help to explain the peculiar continuum shape .    separating the continuum and line emission components ,",

    "furthermore , uncertainties arising from subtraction of late - type stellar photospheric co absorption in do tau may lead to an inflated line - to - continuum ratio , and perhaps an underestimate of the stellocentric radius of the circumstellar co emission .",

    "the coincidence of continuum and line emission is consistent with an origin of the line emission in disk surface layers . while the inferred co distributions for dg tau and do tau allow the possibility of gas in an optically thin disk midplane within the dust sublimation radius , the extended br@xmath2 emission in these sources argues that hot gas may also be co - located with the dust disk",

    "sources showing co emission , requiring excitation to @xmath105 k , might also be able to excite nearby gas to @xmath89 k , thereby producing br@xmath2 emission .",
    "such high temperature gas could also produce free - free emission , perhaps emitting the continuum that is roughly spatially coincident with both the co overtone and br@xmath2 emission in these objects .",
    "however the fact that inferred continuum sizes for these sources are compatible with expected dust sublimation radii ( section [ sec : cont ] ) suggests that the continuum may trace dust .    while thermal emission from the central star is insufficient to heat gas at these stellocentric radii to such high temperatures , non - thermal x - ray or uv radiation can excite co and other gaseous emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we speculate that a binary model , where the secondary resembles an agb star , could explain the data for v1685 cyg .",

    "we found that disk and infall / outflow models typically produced fits of comparable quality , but that sources with the highest signal - to - noise data preferred infall / outflow models . based on this preference , and other lines of evidence in the literature",
    ", we argued that infall / outflow models are more likely for our sample in general .",
    "all best - fit models to the br@xmath2 observations indicated gas extending to small stellocentric radii , @xmath102 au , consistent with accreting matter on the magnetospheric scale . however some br@xmath2-emitting gas also seems to located at radii @xmath5 au , perhaps tracing the inner regions of magnetically launched outflows .",
    "the fitted radial brightness profiles of the br@xmath2 emission varied across our sample , reproducing the range of average inferred sizes of the br@xmath2 emitting regions .",
    "the average size scales of the br@xmath2 emission for our sample are inferred to be smaller than the continuum emission distribution in most cases , consistent with previous work .",
    "however for a handful of objects the br@xmath2 and continuum emission distributions are nearly coincident .",
    "these objects join the small number of other targets with previously detected extended br@xmath2 emission @xcite .",
    "the sources with relatively extended br@xmath2 emission are also the objects in our sample that show co overtone emission .",
    "co overtone emission is detected from five objects .",
    "strong emission is detected from as 353 a and v1331 cyg .",
    "weaker emission is detected from v1685 cyg , but strong signatures are seen in the spatially resolved ki data .",
    "emission features are seen in dg tau and do tau , although these detections depend on the subtraction of photospheric absorption features from the late - type central stars .",
    "the co emission is distributed on scales comparable to continuum and br@xmath2 emission for as 353 a , v1331 cyg , and v1685 cyg . for dg tau and",
    "do tau , the co appears to be located at smaller radii , although there is additional uncertainty on this result related to the subtraction of photospheric co features .    for each of these sources , we computed synthetic spectra , @xmath21 and differential phases for a disk model , and compared with ki and nirspec observations across the co bandheads . to fit the data we required a narrow spatial distribution of co with a temperature @xmath95 k. models with the co confined to disk regions with fractional widths of 20% matched the data well .",
    "the near - coincidence of co , br@xmath2 , and continuum emission for the sub - sample of objects identified as co emitters suggests these systems share peculiar properties .",
    "we speculated that these objects may have unusually active accretion processes that can generate non - thermal excitation of gas at large stellocentric radii .",
    "we also argued that while the continuum emission may trace dust sublimation fronts , the line emission may arise in hot , non - thermally - excited , atmospheres above these dusty rims .",
    "alternatively , dusty winds with overlying , non - thermally - excited , dust - free regions may explain the line and continuum data .",
    "finally , we discussed the unusual behavior of v1685 cyg .",
    "this target shows a large spatial offset between the co and continuum emission , as well as a peculiar broadband behavior of the @xmath21 .",
    "we suggested that a faint binary companion with strong molecular absorption features ( perhaps resembling an agb star ) might explain these observations .    *",

    "<S> our observations span the @xmath1-band , and include the br@xmath2 transition of hydrogen and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions of carbon monoxide . for several targets we also present data from keck / nirspec that provide higher spectral resolution , but a seeing - limited spatial resolution , of the same spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the br@xmath2 emission in the context of both disk and infall / outflow models , and conclude that the br@xmath2 emission traces gas at very small stellocentric radii , consistent with the magnetospheric scale </S>",
    "<S> . however some br@xmath2-emitting gas also seems to be located at radii of @xmath5 au , perhaps tracing the inner regions of magnetically launched outflows . </S>",
    "<S> co emission is detected from several objects , and we generate disk models that reproduce both the ki and nirspec data well . we infer the co spatial distribution to be coincident with the distribution of continuum emission in most cases . furthermore the br@xmath2 emission in these objects is roughly coincident with both the co and continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> we present potential explanations for the spatial coincidence of continuum , br@xmath2 , and co overtone emission , and explore the implications for the low occurrence rate of co overtone emission in young stars . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide additional discussion of v1685 cyg , which is unusual among our sample in showing large differences in emitting region size and spatial position as a function of wavelength . </S>"
