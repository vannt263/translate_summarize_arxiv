    "hydrodynamic turbulence often occurs in the absence of linear instability , e.g. turbulence in pipe flow ( pouseille flow )  @xcite .",
    "although many robust linear instabilities exist in magnetized plasmas , nonlinear instability can arise as has been shown in many turbulence simulations .",
    "sometimes the instabilities were found to be of the subcritical  @xcite or supercritical  @xcite variety , while at other times the nonlinear instability simply overpowered a particular linear instability to drive the turbulence  @xcite . in the scenario applicable to turbulence in the large plasma device ( lapd )  @xcite  in which the magnetic fields lines are straight and without shear ",
    "several studies showed the turbulence to be driven by a nonlinear instability of this last type , where the nonlinear instability imposed itself over a linear drift - wave instability  @xcite .",
    "one of these  @xcite used lapd experimental parameters and profiles in the simulation and demonstrated that the nonlinear instability was necessary to drive turbulence with characteristics similar to that of the experiment .",
    "now , these studies  @xcite all ascertained that the mechanism driving the nonlinear instability relies upon axial wavenumber transfers between @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures .",
    "the reason is that the turbulence self - organizes to preferentially drive @xmath2 density and temperature fluctuations , taking energy from the density and temperature equilibrium gradients .",
    "but in order to access the adiabatic response , which transfers energy into the dynamically critical @xmath4 flows , the @xmath2 fluctuations must transfer their energy through nonlinear three - wave decay into @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "all of these straight magnetic field simulations , however , employed periodic boundary conditions in the axial ( field - aligned ) direction .",
    "one can justifiably question the use of periodic axial boundary conditions to model lapd and wonder whether the nonlinear instability is an artifact of this choice .",
    "the use of this boundary condition , for example , prevents the fastest growing linear drift - waves in lapd from being captured in the simulation : with periodic boundary conditions the longest wavelength mode has its wavelength equal to the length of the device whereas the fundamental mode ( half - wavelength equal to the device length ) has a higher growth rate .",
    "this may be the reason why the simulations produce @xmath2 structures .",
    "would these disappear if the simulations are allowed access to longer wavelength structures through different boundary conditions ?",
    "furthermore , the actual lapd axial boundary includes conducting structures ; it is well known that sheaths on metal walls can drive linear instabilities like the conducting wall mode  @xcite .",
    "clearly , periodic boundary simulations miss this wall physics .",
    "axial boundary conditions do in fact have a significant affect on the linear stability properties of the system , which is shown in detail in section  [ sec_linear ] . and",
    "since the nonlinear instability relies upon very - long - parallel - wavelength modes to operate , it is reasonable to speculate that the boundaries also might have a significant affect on the nonlinear instability properties .",
    "the real axial boundaries in lapd are complicated .",
    "one side of the device contains a hot , emissive cathode behind a mesh anode , and in front of that sits a biased limiter with radius slightly less than the cathode radius  @xcite .",
    "the other side contains a floating mesh plate , which is likely shielded by a layer of neutral gas ( the plasma may be detached from the plate on this end ) .",
    "not only is it difficult to determine what the actual axial boundary conditions are , it is also difficult to develop and implement models for the boundaries . thus , this paper takes a simpler approach of exploring the affect of non - periodic axial boundary conditions on the nonlinear turbulent dynamics using various idealized boundaries , leaving the calculation and implementation of physically realistic boundary conditions to future work .",
    "the different axial boundary conditions used here include zero - value , zero - derivative , and perfectly conducting metal plates , which can be modeled with a bohm sheath condition .",
    "the main finding is that the nonlinear instability is robust to changes in boundary conditions : while the linear stability properties are modified significantly with different boundary conditions , the nonlinear instability still dominates the turbulent drive in all cases .",
    "in fact , the qualitative properties of the turbulence and the turbulent dynamics are similar between the simulations .",
    "quantitatively , there are some differences between the simulations such as varying fluctuation levels and varying degrees to which the nonlinear instability dominates the linear ones .",

    "additionally , all of the @xmath83 terms are summed over as well .",
    "the @xmath34 contribution is separated from the other @xmath35 components because the @xmath85 dynamic is the primary factor that determines whether the linear instability or the nonlinear instability dominates the energy drive  @xcite .    in these diagrams ,",

    "the four @xmath92 arrows contain values that sum to @xmath93 ( by choice of normalization ) . since the @xmath92 pathways are the only pathways that deposit net energy into the fluctuations , the numbers in all arrows represent a percentage of the total energy injected into the system .",
    "now , a majority of the energy deposited into the fluctuations ( @xmath94 for the periodic simulation and @xmath95 for the sheath simulation ) is from the density gradient into the @xmath34 density fluctuations .",
    "this is not a path allowed by the linear drift - wave instabilities in the system since they can only deposit energy into @xmath83 fluctuations .",
    "in fact , in this turbulent state , more energy is transfered by nonlinear three - wave coupling into @xmath83 fluctuations than by direct injection from the equilibrium gradients .",
    "the three - wave coupling is represented by the @xmath96 and @xmath97 arrows .",
    "the direction of these arrows is from @xmath98 , which is opposite to that expected from the common cascading type turbulent paradigm where the linear instability dominates the turbulent injection dynamics and three - wave processes transfer energy to waves that are linearly stable .",
    "the reason why all of the non - dissipated energy that is injected into @xmath34 density and temperature structures goes into @xmath83 density and temperature potential energy structures rather than into @xmath34 kinetic energy structures is that potential to kinetic energy transfer can only work through the adiabatic response , which requires @xmath83 .",
    "actually , in the sheath simulation , potential energy can transfer to kinetic energy through the axial boundaries , but this still requires @xmath83 and it works only through the temperature fluctuations , which are less important than the density fluctuations in the simulations .",
    "note , in fact , that boundary contributions are nt included in the energy dynamics calculations as they are insignificant .",
    "so the main transfer channel from potential to kinetic energy , shown by the @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 arrows , is the adiabatic response .",
    "the adiabatic response takes energy from the @xmath83 density and temperature fluctuations and transfers it into the parallel velocity fluctuations ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively ) .",
    "it then transfers some of this energy into @xmath83 potential fluctuations ( @xmath101 ) , while much of the fluctuation energy is ohmically dissipated ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the final step of the energy dynamics process is a three - wave axial wavenumber transfer from potential fluctuations at @xmath83 to potential fluctuations at @xmath34 , which are of course neccessary in making the @xmath103 and @xmath104 terms finite .",
    "meanwhile , dissipation acts on all fluctuations , which is quantified by the @xmath105 arrows throughout .",

    "@xcite rather than the paradigmatic process of linear instability energy injection followed by nonlinear cascading . and",
    "second , the periodic and sheath simulations have qualitatively similar dynamics despite the fact that the linear stability properties of the two cases are qualitatively different .",
    "this is also true of the dirichlet and neumann simulations , although their diagrams are not shown in fig .",

    "since the growth rates sum over the fields , it s not as difficult to view them in their full wavenumber space ( both in @xmath40 and @xmath35 ) .",

    "the similarity in the turbulent structures ( see fig .  [ statistics ] ) also points to this conclusion .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the @xmath34 suppressed simulation , which has an @xmath43 growth rate similar to the linear growth rate ( fig .  [ drift_cwm_gamma ] ) and a negative @xmath34 growth rate .",
    "note that even though the @xmath34 fluctuation components are removed from the @xmath34 suppressed simulation at each time step , @xmath34 fluctuations are nonlinearly excited ( by three - wave transfer ) by the @xmath83 fluctuations , and therefore , they do have small but finite amplitude prior to their removal , which can be used to calculate the growth rate of these modes . furthermore , the turbulent growth rate of the @xmath43 component of the @xmath34 suppressed simulation is slightly less than the linear growth rate due to the fact that eigenmodes other than the fastest growing ones are nonlinearly excited in the turbulent simulation , thus damping the growth rate .",

    ", the linear eigenmode should have little bearing on the structure of the turbulence and therefore little energy should be contained in this eigenmode .",

    "this may be calculated by projecting the fastest growing eigenmode onto the turbulent state .",
    "formally , in the model considered in this study , the turbulent state is fully described by four independent fields , which can be appended into a single vector of the spatio - temporal field functions : @xmath111 .",
    "this vector may be decomposed in a complete basis :    [ basis_decomp ] f_turb(,t ) = _ i , m c_i , m(t ) _ i , m(r , z ) e^i m ,    where @xmath112 are time - independent spatial complex basis functions of the form @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are the complex time - dependent amplitudes . the @xmath115 dependence of the basis functions has been explicitly imposed as a fourier basis .",
    "the total number of linearly independent basis functions is the number of total grid points used in the simulation times the number of independent fields , which is four in this case .",
    "now , @xmath112 can be any linearly independent set of functions and need not be the linear eigenfunctions of the system .",
    "in fact , the linear eigenfunctions of the equations used here are not orthogonal , and are thus not very useful to consider .",
    "however , it is quite useful to set @xmath116 to the fastest growing linear eigenmode because this is the structure of interest that is to be projected onto the turbulence .",
    "the other @xmath117 comprise the remainder of the orthonormal basis , and they must be different from the remaining linear eigenfunctions in order to complete the orthogonal basis .",
    "it is nt necessary for the purpose of this study to actually compute these other basis functions , but if one were to compute them , one might start with all of the linear eigenmodes and perform a gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure , making sure to start with the fastest growing eigenmode in order to preserve it . using this procedure , hatch et al .",
    "@xcite found that a significant fraction ( @xmath118 ) of the energy in a turbulent state of itg turbulence was contained in the fastest growing linear eigenmode at each perpendicular wavenumber .",
    "such a result , however , does nt require knowledge of the other basis functions , and thus they are not computed here .",
    "now , to compute this fraction , first define an inner product that is energetically meaningful and that sets the orthonormality of the basis functions :    [ basis_orthonormality ] = w _ i , m^ * _ j , m dv = _ i , j .",
    "the weighting @xmath119 is such that @xmath120 . now from eqs .",
    "[ basis_decomp ] and  [ basis_orthonormality ] , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "then , the amount of energy contained in the fastest growing mode ( for each @xmath40 ) is given by the square of the projection of the mode onto the turbulence : @xmath123 .",
    "the ratio @xmath124 is a measure of the fraction of turbulent energy contained in the fastest growing linear eigenmode .    of course",
    ", @xmath125 is easily calculated from the turbulent state , but @xmath126 in the turbulent state can only be found with knowledge of the fastest growing eigenfunction .",
    "the fastest growing eigenfunction , though , can be found easily by running a simulation from a random or turbulent state with all of the nonlinearities removed from the model equations as was done in section  [ sec_linear ] . after some time",
    ", the fastest growing eigenfunctions will come to dominate the fluctuation structure .",
    "then , a fourier decomposition in @xmath40 space will separate the fastest growing eigenfunctions at each @xmath40 , including the real and imaginary part of the eigenfunctions ( up to a time dependent complex constant , which is removed by normalizing the eigenfunction ) .",
    "these eigenfunctions can then be projected onto the turbulent state with the inner product defined in eq .",
    "[ basis_orthonormality ] , giving @xmath126 .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratios ] for the five simulations . for the most part ,",
    "the simulations other than the @xmath34 suppressed one have a small value of the ratio ( @xmath128 ) for all @xmath40 .",
    "this confirms that the turbulence largely self - organizes without regard to the linear physics .",
    "the one exception is the dirichlet simulation for @xmath129 , which has @xmath130 .",
    "most of the energy in this and the other simulations , however , is at low @xmath40 where the turbulent growth rates are largest  @xcite , so these larger @xmath40 eigenmodes do nt make a large impact on the overall structure of the turbulence .",
    "in fact , @xmath127 is below @xmath131 for @xmath132 for the periodic , dirichlet , and neumann simulations , precisely the area where @xmath34 structures dominate the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising then that the fastest growing linear eigenfunctions , which have little or no flute character , do nt make up much of the energy of the signal .",
    "the sheath simulation shows more linear eigenmode dominance at low @xmath40 because of the relatively large cwm growth rate , but @xmath127 is still only about @xmath133 , which is nt enough for the linear eigenmodes to dominate the turbulent structure .",
    "also not surprising is that the fastest growing eigenfunctions make up a significant fraction of the energy in the @xmath34 suppressed simulation . where the linear drift wave instability ( and the turbulent growth rate ) is the strongest ( at @xmath134 ) , @xmath130 .",
    "the linear physics controls the @xmath34 suppressed simulation , and the linear eigenmode structure certainly asserts itself in the turbulence , but only to a certain degree ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "[ ratios ] shows the relative strength of the linear instabilities compared to nonlinear effects for each of the simulations . while the nonlinear instability is dominant for all of the simulations other than the @xmath34 suppressed one , the linear instabilities do still act to varying degree in all of the simulations .     of the turbulent energy in the fastest growing linear eigenmode to the total energy at each @xmath40 for all of the simulations .",
    "the observation of filamentary @xmath2 structures is common in many different kinds of experiments and simulations  @xcite . not surprisingly , the presence of these structures is usually attributed to linear flute - like instabilities such as flow - driven kelvin - helmholtz or interchange instabilities rather than to nonlinear instabilities  @xcite . due to natural limitations in plasma turbulence experiments ,",
    "one usually has to resort to indirect evidence to gain insight into physical mechanisms of observed turbulence .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations have all spatial and temporal information available which allows one to perform detailed turbulence analyses , such as the energetics analysis performed in this paper .",
    "this can make turbulence simulations ( provided they are validated on observable data ) an important tool for uncovering underlying physical mechanisms .    through simulation of a particular lapd experiment ,",
    "this paper has shown a nonlinear instability to be the driving force behind the turbulence .",
    "more acurately , this paper has extended earlier work  @xcite that showed this . however , this extension is important because it deals with the matter of axial boundary conditions , and the nonlinear instability depends on axial wave dynamics , so the boundary conditions could have greatly affected this .",
    "and although the various boundary conditions used here do have significant qualitative and/or quantitative effects on the linear instabilities of the system , they do not affect the turbulence in a significant way .",
    "specifically , the nonlinear instability that preferentially drives @xmath2 structures remains robust to the change in boundary conditions .",
    "quantitatively , the sheath , zero - value , and zero - derivative boundary conditions do cause the linear instability to be more competitive with the nonlinear instability , but this effect is not large enough to change the qualitative picture .",
    "this research was performed under appointment to the fusion energy sciences fellowship program administered by oak ridge institute for science and education under a contract between the u.s .",
    "department of energy and the oak ridge associated universities .",
    "we would like to thank prof .",
    "paul terry for many useful discussions .",

    "it is well known that fourier reconstructions of signals that contain discontinuities or non - periodic boundaries are subject to gibbs phenomena .",
    "a clear indication of this is the convergence properties of the fourier reconstructions .",
    "take a discrete signal with the following fourier decomposition :          there are several types of convergences of the @xmath139 , one of which is the @xmath140 norm . defining the difference between the original signal and the fourier reconstruction of order @xmath35 as @xmath141 , one can look at the convergence of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath35 . for periodic signals",
    ", @xmath142 converges exponentially , while it only converges algebraically ( power law ) for non - periodic or discontinuous signals .",
    "@xmath142 is plotted for the cases of the periodic and sheath simulations in fig .",
    "[ fourier_convergence ] . even though the x - axis label @xmath35 indicates the mode with the @xmath143 largest amplitude by construction of eq .",
    "[ f_recon ] , it also happens to correspond to the axial mode number for all but the last few @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , in both simulations , most of the energy is contained in @xmath34 modes followed by @xmath43 modes and so on .",
    "therefore , in reality , the axial fourier decomposition is a useful tool for even the sheath simulation despite the fact that fourier modes are not natural eigenmodes in this case .",
