    "the arecibo galaxy environment survey ( ages ) is targetting a wide range of environments from clusters such as virgo ( taylor et al . 2012 ; 2013 ) and abell 1367 ( cortese et al .",
    "2008 ) to the local void .",
    "isolated galaxies are the least - dense environments targetted that are known , a priori , to contain a single large galaxy and thus a massive dark matter halo .",
    "isolated galaxies are found in low density environments , outside of groups and clusters .",
    "they have long been the object of study , with karachentseva ( 1973 ) defining the original catalogue of isolated galaxies using the 2d criterion of there being no significant companion within 20 optical diameters , where a significant companion is definied as being one having an optical diameter within a factor of four of the galaxy being studied .",
    "more recently , karachentsev et al . (",
    "2011 ) have taken advantage of our modern knowledge of the 3d distribution of galaxies to construct the catalogue of local orphan galaxies using 3d isolation criteria .",
    "note that the definition of isolated galaxies is based on the distance to the nearest significant companion , by contrast void galaxies are found inside voids that are much larger than 20 optical diameters but may lie close to a significant companion ( particularly along ` void filaments ' , e.g. alpaslan et al . 2014 ) and so may not meet the criteria for isolation .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      initial analysis of the data cubes was carried out by human inspection of the velocity region around each isolated galaxy .",
    "this led to the identification of one candidate near ngc 1156 , two candidates near ugc 2082 , and one candidate near ngc 5523 .",
    "one of the candidates near ugc 2082 was detected strongly enough not to require follow - up observing ; all of the other candidates were followed up at arecibo using the single - pixel l - band wide receiver .",
    "these follow up observations confirmed the reality of the candidate near ngc 1156 , the non - existence of the second ( weaker ) candidate near ugc 2082 , and the non - existence of the candidate near ngc 5523 .",
    "the measured parameters of these companion galaxies are presented in table  [ companions ] and their spectra in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the companion of ugc 2082 , referred to here as ugc 2082a , was discovered by the alfalfa survey of the anti - virgo region ( martin et al .",
    "2009 ) , where it is recorded as agc 122400 .",
    "it is dubious whether , given its projected distance from ugc 2082 and its separation in radial velocity , it is actually a companion of ugc 2082 ; we err on the side of including it in our analysis as a companion as this sets a lower limit on the significance of differences between our isolated galaxy sample and himfs from other regions ( see next section ) .",
    "the companion of ngc 1156 , referred to here as ngc 1156a , is a new detection by ages , previously reported by minchin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as ages j030039 + 254656 .",
    "we have found two companions to our sample of three isolated galaxies ; from poisson statistics we estimate the error on this measurement to be @xmath2 , giving us @xmath3 companions .",
    "we can compare this to the number we expected from the alfalfa field himf of martin et al .",
    "we calculate the expected number around each galaxy taking into account that the selection criteria mean we would not expect to see any companion within 1.2 dex of the parent galaxy ( upper limit in table  [ parameters ] ) , the lower limit to detectability ( lower limit in table  [ parameters ] ) , and the fraction of the virial volume sampled .",
    "we make the conservative assumption that companions would be distributed uniformly within the virial volume , if ( as is likely ) the expected density is centrally peaked this will give us an underestimate of the expected number .",
    "the himf is normalised to have 3 large galaxies with hi masses @xmath4 .",
    "but for a flat himf , normalized in the same manner to the number of large galaxies . ]",
    "we find ( figure  [ alfalfahimf ] ) that the expected number of companions from the field himf with @xmath5 is @xmath6 at the @xmath7 level and @xmath8 at the @xmath9 level . adding this in quadrature with the counting error on our observations , we find that we are inconsistent with the field himf at greater than @xmath9 .",
    "this analysis assumes a uniform mass sensitivity across the range studied , which is not strictly accurate as potential companions can lie in front or behind the isolated galaxy and still be within the 300 kpc radius .",
    "however , the maximum difference this could make to sensitivity is less than 10 per cent . to characterise how robust our result is to errors in estimating the mass limit , we look at the effect of raising it . if we assume we can detect all sources with 7@xmath10 peaks , instead of the 5@xmath10 peaks used in the calculation of our mass limit , then the expected number of sources falls to @xmath11 ( ignoring sources detected below that limit ) , making our result inconsistent at greater than @xmath12 . even if we assume our initial mass limit is off by a factor of two , so we now detect galaxies with 10@xmath10 peaks , we still expect to see @xmath13 sources , inconsistent with our result at the @xmath14 level .",
    "we also compare our sources with a flat himf having the same @xmath15 as the alfalfa field himf and normalised in the same manner to the number of large galaxies , but with @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 ( figure  [ flathimf ] ) . here",
    "we find that we would expect 2.9 companions , which is consistent with the number found . by altering the himf slope to match our observed number",
    ", we find that slopes of @xmath18 or steeper are inconsistent at the 95 per cent ( @xmath19 ) level .",
    "we further compare our results to the ratio of dwarfs to giants in the local group . using data from mcconnachie ( 2012 ) for the smaller galaxies , from kalberla",
    "& kerp ( 2009 ) for the milky way , from braun et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for m31 , and ages data from keenan et al .",
    "( in prep . ) for m33 , we construct the hi mass distribution of the local group . normalising this as with the alfalfa himf to have 3 large ( @xmath20 ) rather than the 5 found in the local group and applying our selection criteria of minimum and maximum mass for companions around each isolated galaxy",
    ", we find that we would expect @xmath1 dwarf companions in our sample .",
    "this differs by more than @xmath21 from the observed number .",
    "however , if we normalise by the volume of the local group ( @xmath22 mpc ; karachentsev & karachentseva 2006 ) , we would expect @xmath23 galaxies .",
    "this shows the space density of the dwarfs around the isolated galaxies is similar ( after correction for the isolation criteria ) to that of dwarfs in the local group .",
    "this seems , at first sight , to be in tension with the result based on the ratio of companions to large galaxies ; however , as we are only considering the volume of the 300 kpc radius sphere around the target galaxy , the space density of large galaxies within this volume is eight times higher than in the local group due to their being the target of the survey .",
    "pisano & wilcots ( 2003 ) found that , when the parent galaxies were included , their himf was declining towards lower masses but flat ( over the limited range sampled ) when only companions were examined .",
    "our observations are consistent with any declining himf in terms of numbers . in terms of the distribution of hi",
    "masses our small number of sources gives little discriminatory power : the kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that we would be inconsistent at the 95 per cent level only with an unfeasibly steeply declining slope having @xmath24 .",
    "our observations are therefore consistent with the distribution seen by pisano & wilcots .",
    "the most likely explanation for our finding fewer dwarfs than predicted from the field and local group samples is that there are intrinsically fewer hi - rich dwarf companions around isolated galaxies than there are dwarf galaxies per large galaxy in richer environments .",
    "this is consistent with the general observation that there is a lower ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies in less dense environments ( e.g. roberts et al . 2007 ; tully et al .",
    "2002 ) and with the interpretation of pisano & wilcots ( 2003 ) .",
    "we use the hi data on the isolated galaxies to look for evidence of interactions , either with the detected companions or with other , undetected galaxies . in figure  [ renzograms ]",
    "we plot renzograms ( named for their inventor , renzo sancisi , see rupen 1999 ) of all three isolated galaxies .",
    "these show contours at the 5@xmath10 level for each channel of the data cube , with the channels colour - coded to indicate their velocity ( with green near the systemic velocity , red at higher recessional velocities , and blue at lower recessional velocities ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ renzograms ] , there are no significant disturbances , and smooth rotation is visible as expected in ugc 2082 and ngc 5523 ( ngc 1156 is close to face on ) . there is therefore no evidence from our hi data that these isolated galaxies have undergone significant interactions in the recent past",
    ".    we also looked at whether the detected companions are likely to have caused any significant disruption to their parent galaxies .",
    "we estimate the ratio ( @xmath25 ) of the tidal forces ( @xmath26 ) exerted by the companions on their parent galaxies to the binding forces ( @xmath27 ) of the parent galaxies using the equation from verley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , following the formalism of dahari ( 1984 ) : @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the mass of the companion galaxy , @xmath30 is the mass of the parent galaxy , @xmath31 is the diameter of the parent galaxy and @xmath32 is the separation between the parent and companion galaxies . note that each fraction is dimensionless , so as long as the same mass units are used for the mass of the companion and the parent and the same distance units are used for the diameter of the parent and the separation the specific units used are unimportant .",
    "we assume that the ratio of the total masses is the same as the ratio of the hi masses and use optical major diameters for the parent galaxies from ned as the diameter .",
    "for the tidal forces to be significant , we would expect @xmath33 or greater ; we find that @xmath34 for ngc 1156a and @xmath35 for ugc 2082a .",
    "for either of these to be significant would require the hi mass to total mass ratio of the companions to be 100  1000 times more than that of the parents .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we do not see evidence for interactions in the renzograms .",
    "we have shown that the field himf is inconsistent at the 7@xmath10 level with the observed number of companions in the ages isolated galaxies sample .",
    "the number of companions is , however , consistent with a flat himf .",
    "we also find that the number of companions is inconsistent at the 3@xmath10 level with the ratio of dwarfs to giants seen in the local group .",
    "we attribute this inconsistency to a genuine difference between the population of gas - rich dwarf galaxies in the field and around isolated galaxies .",
    "neither of the companions we have discovered is large enough or close enough to be likely to have a significant tidal effect on its parent , and the hi maps of the parent galaxies do not show signs of interactions .",
