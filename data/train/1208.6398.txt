    "estimating the density @xmath12 of an unknown measure @xmath1 is a well - known problem in statistical analysis , physics or engineering . in a statistical context , one is usually given observations in the form of a sample of independent or dependent identically distributed random variables obtained from the unknown measure @xmath1 .",
    "and so there has been extensive research on estimating the density based on these observations .",
    "for instance , in one of the most popular approaches , the kernel density estimation @xcite , the density @xmath12 is estimated via a linear combination of kernel functions - each of them being identified with exactly one observation .",
    "the crucial step in this method is to choose an appropriate bandwidth for which minimizing the integrated or the mean - integrated squared error between @xmath12 and its estimate is most common .",
    "another very popular approach uses wavelets @xcite , an example of approximating a density by a truncated orthonormal series .",
    "the coefficients in the truncated wavelet expansion are moment estimates derived from the given identically distributed observations . again",
    ", the approximation accuracy is often measured by the mean - integrated squared error and depends on the number of observations and the degree of the truncation .",
    "this approach provides a global density estimate satisfying both good local and periodic approximation properties . for further details the interested reader",
    "is referred to @xcite and the many references therein .    in another context - arising in challenging fields such as image recognition , solving nonlinear differential equations ,",
    "spectral estimation or speech processing - no direct observation is available , but rather finitely many moments of the unknown measure @xmath1 are given .",
    "then the issue is to reconstruct or approximate the density @xmath12 based on the only knowledge of finitely many moments , ( say up to order @xmath4 ) , an _ inverse _ problem from moments .",
    "a simple method due to @xcite approximates the density @xmath12 by a polynomial @xmath8 of degree at most @xmath5 , so that the moments of the measure @xmath14 matches those of @xmath1 , up to order @xmath5 .",
    "however , and in contrast with more sophisticated approaches , the resulting polynomial approximation @xmath8 is not guaranteed to be a density ( even though @xmath12 is ) as it may takes negative values on the domain of integration .",
    "one classical approach to the moment problem is the pad approximation @xcite which is based on approximating the measure by a ( finite ) linear combination of dirac measures .",
    "the dirac measures and their weights in the decomposition are determined by solving a nonlinear system of equations . in the maximum entropy estimation ( another classical approach )",
    "one selects the best approximation of @xmath12 by maximizing some functional entropy , the most popular being the boltzmann - shannon entropy . in general",
    "some type of weak convergence takes place as the degree increases as detailed in @xcite .",
    "alternatively the norm of the approximate density is chosen as an objective function @xcite , which allows to show a stronger convergence in norm . in @xcite , maximum entropy and pad",
    "approximates have been compared on some numerical experiments .",
    "finally , piecewise polynomial spline based approaches have also been proposed in @xcite",
    ".    * motivation . *",
    "our main motivation to study the ( inverse ) moment problem arises in the context of the so - called generalized problem of moments ( gpm ) .",
    "the abstract gpm is a infinite - dimensional linear program on some space of borel measures on @xmath15 and its applications seem endless , see e.g. @xcite and the many references therein .",
    "for instance , to cite a few applications , the gpm framework can be used to help solve a weak formulation of some ordinary or partial differential equations , as well as some calculus of variations and optimal control problems .",
    "the solution @xmath12 of the original problem ( or an appropriate translate ) is interpreted as a density with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath3 on some domain and one computes ( or approximates ) finitely many moments of the measure @xmath16 by solving an appropriate finite - dimensional optimization problem .",
    "but then to recover an approximate solution of the original problem one has to solve an inverse problem from moments .",
    "this approach is particularly attractive when the data of the original problem consist of polynomials and basic semi - algebraic sets . in this case one",
    "may define a hierarchy ( as the number of moments increases ) of so - called semidefinite programs to compute approximations of increasing quality .",
    "in this paper we consider the following inverse problem from moments : let @xmath1 be a finite borel measure absolutely continuous with respect to some reference measure @xmath3 on a box @xmath17 of @xmath15 and whose density @xmath12 is assumed to be in @xmath10 , with no continuity assumption as in previous works .",
    "the ultimate goal is to compute an _ approximation _",
    "@xmath18 of @xmath12 , based on the only knowledge of finitely many moments ( say up to order @xmath5 ) of @xmath1 . in addition , for consistency , it would be highly desirable to also obtain some  convergence \" @xmath19 as @xmath11 .",
    "\\(a ) firstly , we approximate the density @xmath12 by a polynomial @xmath20 of degree @xmath5 which minimizes the mean squared error @xmath21 ( or equivalently the @xmath10-norm @xmath22 ) over all polynomials @xmath8 of degree at most @xmath5 . we show that an unconstrained @xmath23-norm minimizer @xmath20 exists , is unique , and coincides with the simple polynomial approximation due to @xcite ; it can be determined by solving a system of linear equations .",
    "it turns out that @xmath20 matches all moments up to degree @xmath5 , and it is even easier to compute if it is expressed in the basis of polynomials that are orthonormal with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "no inversion is needed and the coefficients of @xmath20 in such a basis are just the given moments . moreover we show that @xmath24 in @xmath10 as @xmath11 , which is the best we can hope for in general since there is no continuity assumption on @xmath12 ; in particular @xmath25 almost - everywhere and almost - uniformly on @xmath17 for some subsequence @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "even though both proofs are rather straightforward , to the best of our knowledge it has not been pointed out before that not only this mean squared error estimate @xmath20 is much easier to compute than the corresponding maximum entropy estimate , but it also converges to @xmath12 as @xmath11 in a much stronger sense . for the _ univariate case _ , in references @xcite and @xcite the authors address the problem of approximating a _ continuous _ density on a compact interval by polynomials or kernel density functions that match a fixed number of moments . in this case , convergence in supremum norm is obtained when the number of moments increases .",
    "an extension to the noncompact ( stieltjes ) case is carried out in @xcite . notice that in @xcite it was already observed that the resulting polynomial approximation also minimizes the mean square error and its coefficients solve a linear system of equations . in @xcite the minimum - norm solution ( and not the minimum distance solution ) is shown to be unique solution of a system of linear equations . in @xcite the minimal distance solution is considered but it is obtained as the solution of a constrained optimization problem and requires an initial guess for the density estimate .",
    "\\(b ) however , as already mentioned and unlike the maximum entropy estimate , the above unconstrained @xmath23-norm minimizer @xmath20 may _ not _ be a density as it may take negative values on @xmath17 .",
    "of course , the nonnegative function @xmath28 $ ] also converges to @xmath12 in @xmath23 but it is not a polynomial anymore .",
    "so we next propose to obtain a _ nonnegative polynomial _",
    "approximation @xmath20 by minimizing the same @xmath23-norm criterion but now under the additional constraint that the candidate polynomial approximations should be nonnegative on @xmath17 . in principle",
    "such a constraint is difficult to handle which probably explains why it has been ignored in previous works .",
    "fortunately , if @xmath17 is a compact basic semi - algebraic set one is able to enforce this positivity constraint by using putinar s positivstellensatz @xcite which provides a nice positivity certificate for polynomials strictly positive on @xmath17 . importantly , the resulting optimization problem is convex and even more , a semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problem which can be solved efficiently by public domain solvers based on interior - point algorithms .",
    "moreover , again as in the unconstrained case , we prove the convergence @xmath24 in @xmath10 as @xmath11 ( and so almost - everywhere and almost - uniform convergence on @xmath17 as well for some subsequence @xmath29 , @xmath27 ) which is far stronger than the weak convergence obtained for the maximum entropy estimate .",
    "notice , in @xcite methods for obtaining some non - negative estimates are discussed , however these estimates do not satisfy the same properties in terms of mean - square error minimization and convergence as in the unconstrained case . in the kernel density element method @xcite a nonnegative density estimate for the univariate case is obtained by solving a constrained convex quadratic optimization problem . however , requiring each coefficient in the representation to be nonnegative as presented there seems more restrictive than the nonnegative polynomial approximation proposed in this paper .",
    "\\(c ) our approach is illustrated on some challenging applications . in the first set of problems we are concerned with recovering the shape of geometrical objects whereas in the second set of problems we approximate solutions of nonlinear differential equations",
    "moreover , we demonstrate the potential of this approach for approximating densities with jump discontinuities , which is harder to achieve than for the smooth , univariate functions discussed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath23-approximations clearly outperform the maximum entropy estimates with respect to both running time and pointwise approximation accuracy . moreover , our approach is able to handle sets @xmath17 more complicated than a box ( as long as the moments of the measure @xmath30 are available ) as support for the unknown density , whereas such sets are a challenge for computing maximum entropy estimates because integrals of a combination of polynomials and exponentials of polynomials must be computed repeatedly .      in section [ notations ]",
    "we introduce the notation and we state the problem to be solved . in section [ l2 ]",
    "we present our approach to approximate an unknown density @xmath12 by a polynomial @xmath20 of degree at most @xmath5 via unconstrained and constrained @xmath23-norm minimization , respectively ; in both cases we also prove the convergence @xmath24 in @xmath10 ( and almost - uniform convergence on @xmath17 as well for some subsequence ) as @xmath5 increases . in section [ secnumex ]",
    "we illustrate the approach on a number of examples - most notably from recovering geometric objects and approximating solutions of nonlinear differential equations - and highlight its advantages when compared with the maximum entropy estimation . finally , we discuss methods to improve the stability of our approach by considering orthogonal bases for the functions spaces we use to approximate the density . and",

    "if one chooses the boltzmann - shannon entropy @xmath86 , the resulting estimate with maximum - entropy is an optimal solution of the optimization problem @xmath87 it turns out that an optimal solution @xmath20 is of the form @xmath88 for some vector @xmath89 .",

    "since the estimate @xmath20 is an exponential of a polynomial , it is guaranteed to be nonnegative on @xmath17 and so it is a density .",
    "however , even though the problem is convex it remains hard to solve because in first or second - order optimization algorithms , computing the gradient or hessian at a current iterate @xmath94 requires evaluating integrals of the form @xmath95 which is a difficult task in general , except perhaps in small dimension @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",

    "we discuss the particular case when the basis of the easier functional space is orthogonal , and also effects resulting from truncating the infinite dimensional series expansion of the unknown function .",

    "this overshoot does not vanish , it only moves closer to the jump for increasing @xmath5 .",
    "since the truncated fourier series is the trigonometric analogue of unconstrained mean squared norm minimizer of problem ( [ unconopt ] ) , the question arises of how the trigonometric estimate behaves for a periodic functions when adding nonnegativity constraints as in problems ( [ noliftopt ] ) and ( [ putinaropt ] ) which aim at preventing the estimate from over- or undershooting near jump discontinuities .    in order to derive a tractable sdp problem ,",
    "the nonnegativity constraints for the trigonometric polynomial need to be relaxed or tightened to lmi constraints .",
    "the difference with the real case will be the moment and localizing matrices being of toeplitz type in contrast with the hankel type matrices in the constraints of problem ( [ noliftopt ] ) .      in our discussions in the previous sections we approximated an unknown density by a linear combination of elements of the monomial basis of the space of real polynomials .",
    "this choice of a basis for @xmath268 $ ] has several theoretical and practical shortcomings .",

    ". the amplitude of this overshoot does not decrease for increasing @xmath5 , but the overshoot moves closer to the jump .",
    "when adding the global nonnegativity constraint for the polynomial estimate , the undershoot at the left side disappears .",
    "however , it is compensated for by a weaker , overall pointwise approximation accuracy of the estimate .",
    "this observation is a first , partial answer to the question raised in the complex case .",
    "we introduced an approach for estimating the density of a measure given a finite number of its moments only , in the multivarite case and with no continuity assumption on the density .",
    "as an estimate we choose the polynomial minimizing the @xmath23 norm distance , or mean squared error to the unknown density .",
    "we have shown that this estimate is easy to determine by solving a linear system of equations . moreover",
    ", it converges almost uniformly towards the desired density when the degree increases . by minimizing the mean",
    "squared error subject to additional linear matrix inequality constraints , which translates to solving a semidefinite program , we obtain a density estimate guaranteed to be nonnegative on the support of the measure .",
    "also in the constrained case , we have shown almost uniform convergence of the nonnegative mean squared error minimizer towards the unknown density , when the degree increases .",
    "mean squared error minimization is often superior to maximum entropy estimation in terms of approximation accuracy and computation time , as demonstrated for a number of examples .",
    "moreover , it is able to handle general , basic , compact semialgebraic sets as support for the unknown measure , which present a challenge to maximum entropy estimation in higher dimension .",
