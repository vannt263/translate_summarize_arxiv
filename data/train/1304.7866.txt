    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath0sb ) is one of the most important features in low - energy qcd .",
    "this is considered to be the origin of several hadron masses , such as the lightest nucleon mass . however , there is a possibility that only a part of the lightest nucleon mass is generated by the spontaneous @xmath0sb and the remaining part is the chiral invariant mass .",
    "this structure is nicely expressed in so called parity doublet models ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is an interesting question to ask how much amount of the nucleon mass is generated by the spontaneous @xmath0sb , or to investigate the origin of nucleon mass . studying dense baryonic matter",
    "would give some clues to understand the origin of our mass , since a partial restoration of chiral symmetry will occur at high density region .",
    "we expect that the mass generated by the spontaneous @xmath0sb will become small near the chiral phase transition point .",
    "it is not so an easy task to study the dense baryonic matter from the first principle , namely starting from qcd itself : it may not be good to use the perturbative analysis , and the lattice qcd is not applicable due to the sign problem at this moment .",
    "then , instead of the analysis from the first principle , it may be useful to make an analysis based on effective models , especially for qualitative understanding .",
    "holographic qcd ( hqcd ) models ( see , for reviews , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ) are constructed based on the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite and powerful tools to study the low - energy hadron physics . there",
    "exist several ways to apply hqcd models for dense baryonic matter ( see e.g. refs .",
    "recently the holographic mean field theory approach was proposed to study dense baryonic matter in ref .",
    "this approach allows us to predict the equation of state between the chemical potential and the baryon number density . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approach was applied to a top - down model of hqcd  @xcite including the baryon fields in the framework of the sakai - sugimoto ( ss ) model  @xcite .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the ss model provides the repulsive force mediated by iso - singlet mesons such as @xmath1 meson among nucleons , while the attractive force mediated by the scalar mesons are not generated . as a result ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the chemical potential increases monotonically with the baryon number density . on the other hand , when the attraction mediated by the scalar meson is appropriately included , the chemical potential is expect to decrease up until the normal nuclear matter density , and",
    "then turn to increase ( see e.g. ref .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study whether the chemical potential decreases with increasing density when the scalar degree of freedom is included .    in this paper , for studying this , we adopt a bottom - up model given in ref .",
    "@xcite which includes five - dimensional baryon field included in the model proposed in refs .",
    "there the five dimensional scalar field @xmath2 is explicitly included to express the chiral symmetry breaking by its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "yet another interest appears in a hqcd model of ref .",
    "since there is no chirality in five dimension , the hqcd model includes two baryon fields ; one transforms linearly under u(2)@xmath3 and another under u(2)@xmath4 .",
    "the existence of two baryon fields naturally generates the parity doublet structure mentioned above . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the boundary condition is adopted in such a way that all of the nucleon mass is generated by the chiral symmetry breaking .    in the present analysis",
    ", we will show that we can adjust the amount of nucleon mass coming from the chiral symmetry breaking by changing the boundary value of the five - dimensional baryon fields : the percentages of the chiral invariant mass in the nucleon mass is controlled by changing the boundary value .",
    "we study how the equation of state in the dense baryonic matter depends on the percentage of the nucleon mass originated from the spontaneous @xmath0sb in the holographic mean field theory approach .",
    "our result shows that , larger the percentage of the mass coming from the spontaneous @xmath0sb is , more rapidly the effective nucleon mass , which is extracted from the equation of state by comparing it with the one obtained in a walecka type model given in ref .",
    "@xcite , with increasing baryon number density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : parity ] , we first review the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then show the parity doubling structure .",
    "we study the equation of state at non - zero baryon density in the model in section  [ holographic_mft ] .",
    "we also discuss the interpretation of our results in terms of a walecka - type model .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussions in section  [ sec : sd ] .",
    "we summarize several intricate formulas needed in this paper in appendix  [ parity ] .",
    "in this subsection we briefly review the holographic qcd model including baryons given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fields relevant to the present analysis are the scalar meson field @xmath2 and two baryon fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as the 5-dimensional gauge fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which transform under the 5-dimensional chiral symmetry as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denote the transformation matrix of chiral symmetry , and @xmath11 with @xmath12 . by using these fields ,",
    "the bulk action is given as @xmath13 where    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the bulk masses for baryons and mesons , @xmath17 the scalar - baryon coupling constant , @xmath18 the gauge coupling constant .",

    "@xmath31 is the spin connection given by @xmath32      in this subsection , we study the parity doubling structure of baryons in the model described in the previous subsection .",
    "note that the analysis in this subsection is done for zero chemical potential , so that only the scalar field @xmath2 has a mean field part , or 4-dimensional vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , expressed by @xmath33 .",
    "the equation of motion ( eom ) for @xmath33 is read from the action @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ s x ] ) as @xmath35 the solution for this eom is obtained as  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath21 is the current quark mass and @xmath37 is the quark condensate @xmath38 . by using this vacuum solution , the eoms for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are given by @xmath39    as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we decompose the bulk fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 the mode expansions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are performed as @xmath44 it is convenient to introduce @xmath45 and @xmath46 as @xmath47 which satisfy @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 corresponding to mass eigenvalues .",

    "( [ eomf+ ] ) with negative energy eigenvalue is actually a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eomf- ] ) with positive energy eigenvalue , which is the reflection of the charge conjugation invariance at zero density .    for solving eq .",
    "( [ eomf+ ] ) we need to fix the boundary conditions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 : at the uv boundary ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 should be zero required by the normalizability",

    "@xcite , the value of @xmath57 at the ir boundary was taken as @xmath58 in such a way that all of the mass of ground state baryon is generated by the chiral symmetry breaking expressed by the vev of @xmath33 .    in the present analysis , we regard the ir value of @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath59 , as a parameter , which turns out to control the percentages of the chiral invariant mass included in the nucleon mass .",

    "this does not agree with the nature , in which the chemical potential decreases against the density in the low density region below the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "this decreasing property is achieved by the subtle cancellation between the repulsive and attractive forces .",
    "so this increasing property indicates that , in the present model , the repulsive force mediated by the u(1 ) gauge field is stronger than the attractive force mediated by the scalar degree included in x field .    for studying the attractive force mediated by the scalar fields , we extract the density dependence of the effective nucleon mass using the walecka type model ( see e.g. refs .",
