    "the dynamical ages of the opposite lobes of 10 selected giant radio sources are estimated using the dynage algorithm of machalski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and compared with their spectral ages determined and studied by jamrozy et al .",
    "the dynage algorithm is an extension of the analytical model for the evolution of frii type radio sources combining the dynamical model of kaiser & alexander ( 1997 ) with the model for expected radio emission from a source under the influence of energy loss processes published by kaiser , dennett - thrope , & alexander 1997 ; hereafter referred to as kda ) .",
    "this algorithm allows to determine the values of four of the model parameters , i.e. the jet power , @xmath1 , central core density , @xmath2 , energy distribution of the relativistic particles injected into the lobe via acceleration processes and described by the spectral index @xmath3 , and the lobe s age , @xmath4 .",
    "the determination of their values is made possible by the fit to the observational parameters of a lobe : its length , @xmath5 , axial ratio ( geometry ) , @xmath6 , normalization and slope of its radio spectrum , i.e. the radio luminosity , @xmath7 , at a number of observing frequencies @xmath8=1,2,3 ... the values of other free parameters of the model have to be assumed .",
    "three basic relations of the model are :    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11      \\1 ) assuming the values of remaining free parameters of the model ( cf .",

    "\\3 ) the steps 1 ) and 2 ) are repeated for a number of @xmath3 values searching for its value which provides a minimum of the kinetic energy delivered to the lobe at the age @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath21 ( figure1 , right ) .",
    "this , in turn , provides the final solutions of @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , as well as of their derivative parameters ( see table  4 in machalski et al .",
    "2007 )    * objections : * independent age solutions give _ different ages _ of the opposite lobes which is shown in figure2 ( left ) .",
    "the differences are larger than expected kinematic age differences due to a projection of the jet s axis .    from equation(2 )",
    "we have    @xmath22    for the same source ( consisting of two lobes ) we note that     larger @xmath5 suggests older @xmath4 , and calculations show that ( usually )     larger @xmath5 accompanies a higher value of @xmath2 than that for shorter @xmath5 .",
    "thus , substitution of @xmath23 into equation(4 ) and a change of @xmath24 can lower @xmath4 . however , this does not satisfy equation(3 ) where the lobe s radiation is controlled by @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore we look for self - consistent age solution",
    ".      let @xmath25 ; thus from equation(1 ) @xmath26    substitution of @xmath27 into equation(4 ) gives the ` self - consistent ' age    @xmath28    the ` self - consistent ' ages of the opposite lobes calculated from equation(5 ) are plotted vs @xmath27 in figure2 ( right ) .",

    "the brighter lobe is found to be younger than the opposite , fainter one , but 2",
    ".   dynamical ages of opposite lobes differ between themselves more than it is expected due to the kinematic age difference related to a projection of the jet s axis toward the observer .",
    "the apparent asymmetries in the lobes length , their luminosity , and age are likely to be due to different propagation conditions of the jets through an external medium .",
    "4 .   assuming different exponents @xmath24 in equation(1 ) in opposite jet s directions , the age difference usually decreases , however still remaining larger than that due to the kinematic effect . 5 .",
    "expected exponents @xmath27 for the shorther lobes are higher that those for the larger ones .",
    "differences of age @xmath29 can be levelled by a departure from the equipartition between the energy densities of magnetic fields and relativistic particles .",
    "an increase of @xmath30 results in increase of the lobe s age ; however it is connected with a corresponding decrease of the jet power .",
    "a decrease of @xmath31 acts inversely .",
    ".   a ratio of the dynamical age to the spectral age is between 1 and 5 .",
    "this is caused by ( i ) a difference between the injection spectral indices determined using the dynage algorithm in the dynamical analysis and the synage algorithm of murgia ( 1996 ) in the spectral - ageing analysis ( shown in figure3 ) , and ( ii ) a different influence of the axial ratio of the lobes in the estimation of the dynamical age and the spectral age .    in machalski , jamrozy , & saikia ( 2009 ) arguments are given that dynage can better take account of radiative effects at low frequencies than synage , and the age solutions should be better than those found with the classical spectral - ageing analysis because the expansion parameters are connected to actual geometry of the lobes for each specific grs .",
    "the dynage algorithm is especially effective for sources at high redshifts for which an intrinsic spectral curvature is shifted to low frequencies .",
