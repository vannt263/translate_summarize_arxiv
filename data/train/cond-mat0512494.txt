    "the normal metallic state of interacting electrons in one spatial dimension has rather exotic properties , which are summarized under the name luttinger liquid behavior : the absence of a discontinuity in the momentum distribution function at the fermi surface , a vanishing density of states at the fermi energy , and an unusual line - shape of the single - particle spectral function , characterized by algebraic singularities and separate peaks for spin- and charge excitations @xcite . to discover these features und study them quantitatively ,",
    "it has been extremely useful to have an exactly solvable effective low energy model for interacting one - dimensional clean metals , the so - called tomonaga - luttinger model ( tlm )  @xcite .",
    "the exact solubility of the tlm relies on two crucial assumptions : the linearization of the energy dispersion for momenta close to the two fermi momenta @xmath11 , and the restriction to two - body scattering processes involving only momentum transfers small compared with @xmath12 ( forward scattering ) .",
    "the single - particle green function is then most conveniently obtained via bosonization @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the ward identity associated with the separate number conservation at each fermi point can be used to derive a closed equation for the single - particle green function @xcite . within the ward - identity approach ,",
    "it is also straightforward to show that collective density oscillations can propagate without damping in the tlm , so that the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the density - density correlation function @xmath13 is exact . as a consequence",
    "the dynamic structure factor @xmath14 of the tlm exhibits a sharp @xmath15-function peak . focusing for simplicity on the spinless tlm with forward scattering interactions @xmath16 in `` g - ology''-notation @xcite",

    "how does the line - shape of @xmath23 change if we do not linearize the energy dispersion ?",
    "since the rpa is exact for linear energy dispersion , it is reasonable to use the rpa as a starting point for quadratic dispersion and to try to calculate the corrections to the rpa perturbatively . at the first sight it seems that this problem can be solved within the usual bosonization approach by treating the effective boson - interactions due to the band curvature within conventional many - body perturbation theory for the bosonized problem@xcite .",
    "however , for frequencies close to @xmath24 this seems not to be possible , and infinite re - summations are necessary @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite and by pereira _",
    "@xcite , both of which found that the damping scales as @xmath29 . in ref .",
    "[ ] it has been shown that the width @xmath0 of the peak of the longitudinal structure factor of the xxz spin - chain is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "this is not necessarily in conflict with @xmath26 for the tlm with band curvature , because the xxz - chain is equivalent to a system of spinless fermions on a lattice .",
    "in contrast to the forward scattering processes of the tlm , the interaction in this model has also scattering processes involving momentum transfers of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "although in the luttinger liquid regime of the xxz - chain these processes are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , their effect on non - universal quantities like @xmath0 might be essential .",
    "a similar argument applies also to ref .",
    "[ ] , where the dynamic structure factor of the calogero - sutherland model is shown to differ from zero only in a finite interval of frequencies of the width proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath31 of the interaction in the calogero - sutherland model is proportional to @xmath32 for all momentum transfers @xmath25 , so that scattering is suppressed for small @xmath25 . on the other hand , the rpa and our strategy of calculating perturbative corrections to the rpa can only be expected to be accurate if the interaction @xmath31 is strongest for small @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore believe that the dynamic structure factor of the calogero - sutherland model  @xcite does not represent the generic behavior of the dynamic structure factor of one - dimensional fermi systems with dominant forward scattering , as given by the tlm with curvature .    as far as the calculation in ref .",
    "[ ] is concerned , it is based on an infinite re - summation of the apparent leading singularities in the weak coupling expansion , using an analogy with the x - ray problem .",
    "we believe that this procedure does not properly take into account the asymptotic ward - identity which guarantees the cancellation of all singularities in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the renormalization of the real part of the energy of the zs mode , which might be essential to obtain the correct damping @xcite , has not been properly taken into account in ref .",
    "[ ] .    within the framework of diagrammatic many - body perturbation theory , the standard approach @xcite to calculate corrections to the rpa",
    "is based on the evaluation of the three feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
