    "in recent years much work has been done on the problem of setting limits in the presence of nuisance parameters , beginning with the seminal paper by feldman and cousins  @xcite .",
    "a fairly comprehensive solution of this problem was given in rolke , lpez and conrad  bib : rlc . in this paper",
    "we will study a related problem , namely that of claiming a new discovery , say of a new particle or decay mode .",
    "statistically this falls under the heading of hypothesis testing .",
    "we will describe a test derived in a fairly standard way called the likelihood ratio test .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the study of the performance of this test .",
    "this is essential for two reasons .",
    "first , discoveries in high energy physics require a very small false - positive , that is the probability of falsely claiming a discovery has to be very small .",
    "this probability , in statistics called the type i error probability @xmath0 , is sometimes required to be as low as @xmath1 , equivalent to a 5@xmath2 event .",
    "the likelihood ratio test is an approximate test , and whether the approximation works this far out in the tails is a question that needs to be investigated .",
    "secondly , in high energy physics we can often make use of multiple channels , which means we have problems with as many as 30 parameters , 20 of which are nuisance parameters",
    ". the sizes of the samples needed to insure that the likelihood ratio test works need to be determined .",
    "we will consider the following general problem : we have data @xmath3 from a distribution with density @xmath4 where @xmath5  is a vector of parameters with @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the entire parameter space .",
    "we wish to test the null hypothesis @xmath8 ( no signal ) vs the alternative hypothesis .",
    "@xmath9  ( some signal ) , where @xmath10 is some subset of @xmath11 .",
    "the likelihood function is defined by@xmath12and the likelihood ratio test statistic is defined by@xmath13intuitively we can understand the statistic in the case of a discrete random variable . in this case the numerator is the maximum probability of the observed sample if the maximum is taken over all parameters allowed under the null hypothesis . in the denominator we take the maximum over all possible values of the parameter . the ratio of these is small if there are parameter points in the alternative hypothesis for which the observed sample is much more likely than for any parameter point in the null hypothesis . in that case",
    "we should reject the null hypothesis .",
    "therefore we define the likelihood ratio test to be : reject the null hypothesis if @xmath14 , for some suitably chosen @xmath15 , which in turn depends on the type i error probability @xmath16 .",
    "how do we find @xmath15 ?",
    "for this we will use the following theorem : under some mild regularity conditions if @xmath17 then @xmath18 has a chi - square distribution as the sample size @xmath19 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the chi - square distribution is the difference between the number of free parameters specified by @xmath20 and the number of free parameters specified by @xmath21 .",
    "a proof of this theorem is given in stuart , ord and arnold  @xcite and a nice discussion with examples can be found in casella and berger  bib : casella .",
    "we begin with a very common type of situation in high energy physics experiments .",
    "after suitably chosen cuts we find @xmath22 events in the signal region , some of which may be signal events .",
    "we can model @xmath22 as a random variable @xmath23 with a poisson distribution with rate @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background rate , @xmath26 the signal rate and @xmath27 the efficiency on the signal .",
    "we also have an independent measurement @xmath28 of the background rate , either from data sidebands or from monte carlo and we can model @xmath28 as a poisson with rate @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the relative size of the sidebands to the signal region or the relative size of the monte carlo sample to the data sample , so that @xmath31 is the point estimate of the background rate in the signal region .",
    "finally we have an independent measurement of the efficiency @xmath32 , usually from monte carlo , and we will model @xmath32 as a gaussian with mean @xmath27 and standard deviation @xmath33 .",
    "so we have the following probability model:@xmath34 in this model @xmath26 is the parameter of interest , @xmath27 and @xmath25 are nuisance parameters and @xmath35 and @xmath33 are assumed to be known . now the joint density of @xmath23 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given by@xmath38finding the denominator of the likelihood ratio test statistic @xmath39 means finding the maximum likelihood estimators of @xmath40 .",
    "they are given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we wish to test @xmath44 vs @xmath45 , so under the null hypothesis we have@xmath46and we find that this is maximized for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "now @xmath49 one special case of this needs to be do be studied separately , namely the case @xmath50 . in this case",
    "we can not take the logarithm and the maxima above have to be found in a different way .",
    "it turns out that the mle s are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath43 , and under the null hypothesis we find @xmath53 and @xmath48 . with this",
    "we find @xmath54 .",
    "first we note that the test statistic does no involve @xmath32 , the estimate of the efficiency .",
    "this is actually clear : the efficiency is for the detection of signal events , but under the null hypothesis there are none .",
    "of course the efficiency will affect the power curve : if @xmath27 is small the observed @xmath22 will be small and it will be much harder to reject the null hypothesis .",
    "now from the general theory we know that @xmath55 has a chi - square distribution with @xmath56 degree of freedom because in the general model there are @xmath57 free parameters and under the null hypothesis there are @xmath58 .",
    "so if we denote the test statistic by @xmath59 we get@xmath60 $ & if $ y>0 $ \\\\",
    "$ 2n\\log ( 1+\\tau ) $ & if $ y=0$% \\end{tabular } \\right.$   \\end{tabular}%\\ ] ] and we have @xmath61 , approximately .",
    "obviously we will only claim a disovery if there is an excess of events in the signal region , and so the test becomes : reject @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "now it can be shown that @xmath65 , the @xmath66 quantile of a chi - squared distribution with one degree of freedom .",
    "the situation described here has previously been studied in rolke , lpez and conrad  @xcite in the context of setting limits .",
    "they proposed a solution based on the profile likelihood .",
    "this solution is closely related to the test described here .",
    "in fact it is the confidence interval one finds when inverting the test described above .",
    "in high energy physics we can sometimes make use of multiple channels .",
    "there are a number of possible extensions from one channel",
    ". we will consider the following model : there are @xmath67 channels and we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath70 , all independent .",
    "we will again find that the efficiencies do not affect the type i error probability .",
    "we will discuss two ways to extend the methods above to multiple channels , both with certain advantages and disadvantages .",
    "we can calculate the likelihood ratio statistic for the full model .",
    "it turns out that the test statistic @xmath71 is given by@xmath72where @xmath73 is the indicator function , that is @xmath74 if @xmath63 , and @xmath75 otherwise . in other words",
    "the test statistic is simply the sum of the test statistics for each channel separately .",
    "the test is then as follows : we reject @xmath62 if @xmath76 .",
    "it can be shown that the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is a linear combination of chi - square distributions .",
    "tables of critical values as well as a routine for calculating them are available from the authors .      here",
    "we will use the following test : reject @xmath62 if @xmath77 , that is , we claim a discovery if there is a significant excess of events in any one channel . for this method",
    "the critical value @xmath15 is found using bonferroni s method .",
    "we therefore reject @xmath62 if @xmath78 , where @xmath79{% 1-\\alpha } ) ) $ ] .    as we shall see soon , which of these two methods performs better depends on the experiment .",
    "how do the above tests perform ? in order to be a proper test they first of all have to achieve the nominal type i error probability @xmath16 .",
    "if they do we can then further study their performance by considering their power function @xmath80 given by@xmath81of course we have @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath80 gives us the discovery potential , that is the probability of correctly claiming a discovery if the true signal rate is @xmath83 .",
    "in simple cases the true type i error probability @xmath0 and the power @xmath84 can be calculated explicitly , in more difficult cases we generally need to use monte carlo . moreover ,",
    "if monte carlo is used a technique called importance sampling makes it possible to find the true type i error probability even out at @xmath85 .",
    "first we will study the true type i error probability as a function of the background rate . in figure",
    "@xmath56 we calculate @xmath16 ( expressed in sigma s ) for background rates ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 here we have used @xmath88 and @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 .     for different values of the background rate @xmath25 ]",
    "it is clear that even for moderate background rates ( say @xmath93 ) the true type i error is basically the same as the nominal one . for smaller background rates ,",
    "the method is conservative , that is , the true significance of a signal is actually even higher than the one claimed , and it is therefore safe to use the method even for small b.    in figure @xmath94 we have the power curves for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 and @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this clearly shows the `` penalty '' of requiring a discovery threshold of @xmath101 : at that level the true signal rate has to be @xmath102 for a @xmath103 chance of making a discovery .",
    "if @xmath104 is used a rate of @xmath105 is sufficient , and for @xmath90 it is @xmath106 .    ]",
    "let us now consider the case of multiple channels . in figure @xmath57",
    "we have the results of the following simulation : there are @xmath107 channels , all with the same background , going from 10 to 100 , and the same @xmath108 .",
    "again we see that the test achieves the nominal @xmath0 even for small background rates .     for different values of the background rate @xmath25 for the 5 channel case .",
    "]    for the last study we will compare the two methods for multiple channels . in figure @xmath109 we have the power curves for the following situations : we have @xmath107 channels with @xmath95 , @xmath97 , and @xmath108 for all channels . in case 1",
    "the signal rate @xmath26 goes from @xmath75 to @xmath110 and is the same in all channels . in case 2",
    "we have @xmath111 going from @xmath75 to @xmath100 and @xmath112 .",
    "all simulations are done using @xmath113 . clearly in case 1",
    "full lrt does better whereas in case 2 it is max lrt .",
    "this is not surprising because the maximum makes this method more sensitive to the `` strongest '' channel whereas the sum makes full lrt more sensitive to a `` balance '' of the channels . in practice , of course ,",
    "a decision on which method to use has to be made before any data is seen .",
    "a discussion of the optimum strategy for making such a decision is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our extension to multiple channels assumes possibly different signal rates in each channel .",
    "the most common situation involves different decay channels of a particle whose existence is being tested . in that case , the different signal rates are due to different branching ratios such that @xmath114 with a common s. a detailed discussion of this case along with the inclusion of information on certain variables in each event ( a technique generally known as marked poisson ) will be found in an upcoming paper .",
    "we have discussed a hypothesis test for the presence of a signal . for the case of a poisson distributed signal with a background that has either a poisson or a gaussian distribution we have carried out the calculations and done an extensive performance study .",
    "we have shown that the test achieves the nominal type i error probability @xmath16 , even at a @xmath91 level .",
    "we extended the test to the case of multiple channels with two possible tests and showed that both achieve the nominal @xmath16 .",
    "either one or the other has better performance depending on the specific experiment ."
