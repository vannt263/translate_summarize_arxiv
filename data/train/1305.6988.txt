    "the study on defaultable corporate bond and credit risk is now one of the most promising areas of cutting edge in financial mathematics .",
    "there are two main approaches to modeling credit risk and pricing defaultable corporate bonds ; one is the _ structural approach _ and the other one is the _ reduced form approach_. in the structural method , we think that the default event occurs when the firm value is not enough to repay debt , that is , the firm value reaches a certain lower threshold ( _ default barrier _ ) from the above . such a default can be expected and thus we call it _ expected default_. in the reduced - form approach , the default is treated as an unpredictable event governed by a default intensity process . in this case , the default event can occur without any correlation with the firm value and such a default is called _",
    "unexpected default_. in the reduced - form approach , if the default probability in time interval @xmath0 $ ] is , then @xmath1 is @xmath2 called _ default intensity _ @xcite .",
    "the two approaches have got their own advantages and shortcomings ( @xcite ) and therefore the use of unified models of structural approach and reduced - form approach is a trend .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "cathcart et al @xcite studied a pricing of corporate bonds in the case when the default intensity is a linear function of the interest rate and gave semi - analytical pricing formulae .",
    "cathcart et al @xcite studied a valuation model in the case when the default intensity ( hazard rate ) is a linear function of the state variable and the interest rate .",
    "realdon @xcite studied a pricing of corporate bonds in the case with constant default intensity and gave pricing formulae of the bond using pde method .",
    "some authors studied the pricing model of defaultable bonds in which the default intensity is given as a stochastic process @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provided analytical pricing formula of corporate defaultable bond with both expected and unexpected default in the case when stochastic default intensity follows wilmott model where drift and volatility are linear of state variables @xcite .",
    "bi et all @xcite got the similar result with @xcite in the case when stochastic default intensity follows cir - like model .",
    "ballestra et al @xcite proposed a model to price defaultable bonds where default intensity follows vasicek - like model or cir - like model coupled with the process of the firm s asset value and provided a closed - form approximate solution to their model .",
    "in @xcite expected default barrier is given in the whole lifetime of the bond .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite the author studied the pricing problem for defaultable corporate bond under the assumption that we only know the firm value and the default barrier at 2 fixed discrete announcing dates , we do nt know about any information of the firm value in another time and the default intensity between the adjoined two announcing dates is a constant determined by its announced firm value at the former announcing date .",
    "the computational error in @xcite is corrected in @xcite .",
    "the approach of @xcite is a kind of study of defaultable bond under _ insufficient information _ about the firm and it is interesting to note that agliardi et al @xcite studied bond pricing problem under _ imprecise information _ with the technique of fuzzy mathematics . the approach of @xcite can be seen as a _ unified model _ of structural model and reduced form model .",
    "agliardi @xcite studied a _ structural model _ for defaultable bond with several ( discrete ) coupon dates where the default can occur only when the firm value is not large enough to pay its debt and coupon in those _ discrete coupon dates_.    speaking on default recovery , most of authors including @xcite have studied the case of _ exogenous _ default recovery which is independent on firm value whereas @xcite have studied the case of _ endogenous _ recovery which is related to firm value , and @xcite studied both cases of exogenous and endogenous recovery .    here",
    "we study the problem of pricing defaultable bond with discrete default intensity and barrier under constant risk free short rate using higher order binary options and their integrals . in our credit risk model",
    ", the default event occurs in an expected manner when the firm value reaches a certain lower threshold - the default barrier at predetermined discrete announcing dates or in an unexpected manner at the first jump time of a poisson process with given default intensity given by a step function of time variable , respectively .",
    "we consider both _",
    "endogenous _ and _ exogenous _ default recovery .",
    "our pricing problem is derived to a solving problem of _ inhomogeneous _ or _ homogeneous black - scholes pdes _ with _ different coefficients _ and terminal value of binary type in every subinterval between the two adjacent announcing dates . in order to deal with the difference of coefficients in subintervals we use a _ relation _ between prices of higher order binaries with different coefficients . in our model , due to the inhomogenous term related to endogenous recovery ,",
    "our pricing formulae are represented by not only the prices of higher binary options but also the integrals of them .",
    "so we consider a _",
    "special binary _ option called _ integral of i - th binary _ or _ nothing _ and then we obtain the pricing formulae of our defaultable corporate bond by using the pricing formulae of higher binary options and integrals of them .    our approach to model credit risk is similar with the one of @xcite .",
    "one of the different points of our model from @xcite is that we here consider arbitrary number of announcing dates but @xcite consider only 2 announcing dates .",
    "another different point from @xcite is that we use constant risk free rate , the purpose of which is to show the applicability of higher order binaries to the pricing of defaultable bonds in the simplest way .",
    "unlikely in @xcite we here consider discrete default intensity independent on firm value and it can be seen incompatible with reality but we think our analytical pricing formulae can help the further study on the more realistic situation with discrete default intensity dependent on firm value .    the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some preliminary knowledge on prices of higher order binary options and their integral on the last expiry date . in section 3",
    "we set our problem for corporate defaultable bonds , provide the pricing formulae in both cases of endogenous and exogenous default recovery and analyze the credit spread . in section 4",
