    "the conjecture that _ mean field phase diagrams are well approximated by systems with long range interactions _ can not be taken literally as it obviously fails in one dimensional systems ( if the second moment of the interaction is finite ) , moreover the mean field critical exponents are [ believed to be ] different from those computed for finite range interactions . with proper caveat",
    "however the conjecture is generally regarded as correct and indeed there are mathematical proofs mainly referring to specific models and focused on the occurrence of phase transitions .",
    "the choice of the approximating hamiltonian is not at all arbitrary and the results so far have been obtained for reflection positive interactions , @xcite , and for kac potentials , @xcite .",
    "the former choice is clearly motivated by a powerful and well developed theory , the latter class seems more general , in particular includes systems of particles in the continuum as the one considered in the present paper .",
    "we will in fact study here a continuum version of the classical potts model .",
    "its mean field free energy is @xmath6\\ ] ] @xmath7 , @xmath8 represents the density of particles with spin @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 ; @xmath11 the inverse temperature ; @xmath12 the chemical potential .    despite the simplicity of the model its thermodynamics , which is defined by minimizing @xmath13 over @xmath14 ,",
    "has a rather interesting structure . in @xcite and @xcite it",
    "is proved that the resulting phase diagram is characterized by a critical curve @xmath15 , as in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath16 has @xmath5 minimizers @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "there are positive numbers @xmath19 , @xmath20 so that @xmath21 furthermore @xmath22 so that the total density of the state @xmath23 is smaller than the total density in any of the ordered critical points @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which is in fact equal to @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 , only the ordered states survive and there are @xmath28 minimizers , when @xmath29 , only the disordered state survives and there is a unique minimizer .",
    "therefore when crossing vertically the critical curve the total density jumps , a phenomenon which can be related to magnetostriction as argued in @xcite .",
    "the kac proposal applied to leads to hamiltonians of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , is a finite configuration of particles with spin ; @xmath12 the chemical potential and @xmath35 , @xmath36 a symmetric probability kernel , say with range 1 .",
    "an analysis a la lebowitz and penrose , @xcite ( see also gates and penrose , @xcite ) proves that the mesoscopic ( @xmath37 ) behavior of the system with hamiltonian @xmath38 is described by @xmath39 as a functional defined on functions @xmath40 with compact support .",
    "let @xmath41 a torus in @xmath42 , call @xmath43 the functional on @xmath44 , then obviously @xmath45 ( just restrict the inf on the l.h.s .  to constant functions ) .",
    "thus a preliminary condition for the particle model to have mean field behavior is to require that holds with equality , which ( we suspect ) requires extra conditions on @xmath46 .    in @xcite",
    "the kac proposal has been modified in such a way that the above condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "call @xmath47 the mean field energy , in our case @xmath48 ( i.e.  the first two terms on the r.h.s .  of",
    ", the third one is the contribution of the entropy to the free energy ) and set @xmath49 @xmath50 with @xmath51 a smooth , symmetric , translational invariant probability kernel with range 1 , @xmath52 if @xmath53 .",
    "namely the `` modified kac proposal '' we are adopting is to suppose that _ the particle hamiltonian has an energy density at point @xmath54 given by the mean field free energy computed on the empirical density @xmath55_. analogous prescription can be applied whenever the mean field order parameter is a density ( or as in this case a collection of densities ) .",
    "the free energy functional associated to is , supposing @xmath41 a torus in @xmath42 , @xmath56 which can be rewritten as @xmath57 by convexity the second integral is non negative and 0 on the constants ; the first one is minimized by taking @xmath58 constantly equal to the minimizer of @xmath59 . thus holds in this case with equality .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian @xmath38 of has the form because it can be written as @xmath60 thus the lmp prescription in this case is just a positivity assumption on the kernel @xmath46 ( more precisely @xmath61 ) . in the sequel we will restrict to the choice",
    ". the main result in this paper is    [ thme1.1 ] for any @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath62 there is @xmath63 and for any @xmath64 there are @xmath65 and @xmath5 dlr measures at @xmath66 , denoted by @xmath67 , with the following properties .    @xmath68 each @xmath69 is a translational invariant , extremal dlr measure ( with trivial @xmath70-algebra at infinity ) ;    @xmath68 any translational invariant dlr measure is a convex combination of @xmath71 ;    @xmath68 calling @xmath72 the average density of particles with spin @xmath73 in @xmath69 and @xmath74 the mean field values , @xmath75 ;    @xmath68 any measure @xmath69 , @xmath25 , is invariant under any exchange of spin labels which does not involve @xmath76 while @xmath77 is invariant under any exchange of spin labels .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thme1.1 ] uses specific features of the model besides the property that is true with equality . which properties are of general nature and which ones are instead truly specific of the model is difficult to say . to a great extent",
    "the proof follows from the analysis ( a la pirogov - sinai ) of the lmp model in chapter 11 and 12 of @xcite , but there are several points where we need to overcome important difficulties not present in the lmp model . among them",
    "the main one is about the exponential decay of correlations in the restricted ensemble , theorem 3.1 of the companion paper @xcite .",
    "how to go from such a result to the proof of theorem [ thme1.1 ] is the content of the present paper .",
    "theorem [ thme1.1 ] does not claim anything away from @xmath66 , this allows to simplify the traditional pirogov - sinai approach .",
    "the conjecture is that when @xmath12 varies in @xmath78 , @xmath79 suitably small , then we go from uniqueness @xmath80 to @xmath28 extremal states , @xmath81 , ( always referring to translational invariant dlr states ) .",
    "the potts model does not exactly fall in the class considered in @xcite but presumably the analysis in @xcite can be extended to prove the above conjecture .",
    "it is also plausible that the estimates are uniform in a small neighborhood of @xmath11 , in such a case we would have local closeness of the mean field and the finite @xmath82 phase diagrams , thus partially confirming the validity of the conjecture in the beginning of the introduction .",
