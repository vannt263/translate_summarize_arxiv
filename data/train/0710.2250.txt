    "chemical networks in interstellar clouds consist of gas - phase and grain - surface reactions @xcite .",
    "reactions that take place on dust grains include the formation of molecular hydrogen @xcite as well as reaction networks producing ice mantles and various organic molecules . unlike gas phase reactions in cold clouds that mainly produce unsaturated molecules , surface processes are dominated by hydrogen - addition reactions that result in saturated , hydrogen - rich molecules , such as h@xmath0co , ch@xmath1oh , nh@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 .",
    "in particular , recent experiments show that methanol can not be efficiently produced by gas phase reactions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are indications that it can be efficiently produced on ice - coated grains @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ability to perform simulations of the production of methanol and other complex molecules on grains is of great importance @xcite . unlike gas - phase reactions , simulated using rate equation models @xcite , grain - surface reactions require stochastic methods such as the master equation @xcite , or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that under interstellar conditions , of extremely low gas density and sub - micron grain sizes , surface reaction rates are dominated by fluctuations which can not be accounted for by rate equations @xcite .",
    "a significant advantage of the master equation over mc simulations is that it consists of differential equations , which can be easily coupled to the rate equations of gas - phase chemistry .",
    "furthermore , unlike mc simulations that require the accumulation of statistical information over long times , the master equation provides the probability distribution from which the reaction rates can be obtained directly .",
    "however , the number of equations increases exponentially with the number of reactive species , making the simulation of complex networks infeasible @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed multi - plane method dramatically reduces the number of equations , by breaking the network into a set of fully connected sub - networks @xcite , enabling the simulation of more complex networks .",
    "however , the construction of the multi - plane equations for large networks turns out to be difficult .    in this letter",
    "we introduce a method based on moment equations which exhibits crucial advantages over the multi - plane method . the number of equations is further reduced to the smallest possible set of stochastic equations , including one equation for the population size of each reactive specie ( represented by a first moment ) and one equation for each reaction rate ( represented by a second moment ) .",
    "thus , for typical sparse networks the complexity of the stochastic simulation becomes comparable to that of the rate equations .",
    "unlike the master equation ( and the multi - plane method ) there is no need to adjust the cutoffs - the same set of equations applies under all physical conditions . unlike the multi - plane equations , the moment equations are linear and for steady state conditions",
    "can be easily solved using algebraic methods . moreover , for any given network the moment equations can be easily constructed using a diagrammatic approach , which can be automated @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate the method we consider a simple network , shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] , that involves three reactive species : h and o atoms and oh molecules @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we denote the reactive species by @xmath3 h , @xmath4 o , @xmath5 oh , and the non - reactive product species by @xmath6 h@xmath0 , @xmath7 o@xmath0 , @xmath8 h@xmath0o .",
    "the reactions that take place in this network include h + o @xmath9 oh ( @xmath10 ) , h + h @xmath9 h@xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) , o + o @xmath9 o@xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) , and h + oh @xmath9 h@xmath0o ( @xmath13 ) .    consider a spherical grain of diameter @xmath14 , exposed to fluxes of h and o atoms and oh molecules .",
    "the cross - section of the grain is @xmath15 and its surface area is @xmath16 .",
    "the density of adsorption sites on the surface is denoted by @xmath17 ( sites @xmath18 ) .",
    "thus , the number of adsorption sites on the grain is @xmath19 .",
    "the desorption rates of atomic and molecular species from the grain are given by @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the attempt rate ( standardly taken to be @xmath22 s@xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is the activation energy for desorption of specie @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( k ) is the grain temperature .",
    "the hopping rate of adsorbed atoms between adjacent sites on the surface is @xmath27 $ ] , where @xmath28 is the activation energy for hopping of @xmath25 atoms ( or molecules ) .",
    "here we assume that diffusion occurs only by thermal hopping , in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "for small grains it is convenient to define the scanning rate , @xmath29 , which is approximately the inverse of the time it takes an @xmath25 atom to scan the surface of the entire grain .",
    "the master equation provides the time derivatives of the probabilities @xmath30 that on a random grain there will be @xmath31 adsorbed atoms / molecules of the reactive specie @xmath25 .",
    "it takes the form    @xmath32   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i=1}^3   w_i \\left [ ( n_i+1 ) p( .. ,n_i+1 , .. ) - n_i p(n_1,n_2,n_3 ) \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i=1}^2   a_i [ ( n_i+2)(n_i+1 ) p( .. ,n_i+2 , .. ) - n_i(n_i-1 ) p(n_1,n_2,n_3 ) ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( a_1+a_2 ) [ ( n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1 ) p(n_1 +",

    "\\label{eq : master } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the terms in the first sum describe the incoming flux , where @xmath33 ( atoms s@xmath23 ) is the flux _ per grain _ of the specie @xmath25 .",
    "the second sum describes the effect of desorption .",
    "the third sum describes the effect of diffusion mediated reactions between two atoms of the same specie and the last two terms account for reactions between different species .",
    "the rate of each reaction is proportional to the number of pairs of atoms / molecules of the two species involved , and to the sum of their scanning rates .",
    "the moments of @xmath30 are given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are integers .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 is the average population size of the specie @xmath25 on a grain .",
    "the production rate per grain , @xmath37 ( molecules s@xmath23 ) , of @xmath38 molecules produced by the reaction @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 , or by @xmath41 in case that @xmath42 .",
    "in numerical simulations the master equation must be truncated in order to keep the number of equations finite .",
    "this can be done by setting upper cutoffs @xmath43 , @xmath44 on the population sizes , where @xmath45 is the number of reactive species .",
    "however , the number of coupled equations , @xmath46 , grows exponentially with the number of reactive species .",
    "this severely limits the applicability of the master equation to interstellar chemistry @xcite . to reduce the number of equations one tries to use the lowest possible cutoffs under the given conditions . in any case , to enable all reaction processes to take place , the cutoffs must satisfy @xmath47 for species that form homonuclear diatomic molecules ( h@xmath0,o@xmath0 , etc . ) and @xmath48 for other species .",
    "the average population sizes of the reactive species and the reaction rates are completely determined by all the first moments and selected second moments of the distribution @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , a closed set of equations for the time derivatives of these first and second moments could provide complete information on the population sizes and reaction rates . for the simple network considered here one needs equations for the time derivatives of the first moments @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and of the second moments @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 [ nodes and edges , respectively , in the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ] .",
    "such equations are obtained by taking the time derivative of each moment and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) to express the time derivatives of the probabilities @xcite . here",
    "we show two of the resulting moment equations :    @xmath56    in these equations , the time derivative of each moment is expressed as a linear combination of several other moments .",
    "however , the right hand sides of these equations include third order moments for which we have no equations . in order to close the set of moment equations",
    "we must express the third order moments in terms of first and second order moments @xcite .",
    "this can be done by imposing the following constraint on the master equation : at any given time , at most two atoms or molecules can be adsorbed simultaneously on the surface .",
    "furthermore , these two atoms or molecules must be from species that react with each other .",
    "the resulting cutoffs allow only eight non - vanishing probabilities , namely , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the third moments in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment1 ] ) can now be expressed in terms of these non - vanishing probabilities , giving rise to the following rules : ( a ) @xmath65 ; ( b ) @xmath66 ; ( c ) @xmath67 . using these rules , which are general and apply to any network of binary reactions",
    ", one can modify eqs .",
    "( [ eq : moment1 ] ) , and obtain a closed set of the form    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 if @xmath42 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this set includes one equation that accounts for the population size of each reactive species and one equation that accounts for the rate of each reaction . although these equations were derived using strict cutoffs , that are expected to apply only in the limit of very small grains and low flux , they provide accurate results for a very broad range of conditions .",
    "the point is that once the set of moment equations is derived , the probabilities do not appear anymore , so the constraint is not explicitly enforced .",
    "in fact , the equations maintain their accuracy even when the populations sizes of the reactive species are well beyond the constraints imposed above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) we present the population sizes of h ( @xmath72 ) and o ( @xmath73 ) atoms on a grain , vs. grain diameter , obtained from the moment equations . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) we present the production rates of h@xmath0 ( squares ) , o@xmath0 ( triangles ) and h@xmath0o ( circles ) vs. grain diameter , obtained from the moment equations .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the master equation ( solid lines ) . in the limit of large grains",
    "they also coincide with the rate equations ( dashed lines ) .",
    "note that the moment equations apply even when there are as many as 10 hydrogen atoms on a grain .",
    "the parameters used in the simulations are @xmath74 ( sites @xmath18 ) , @xmath75 ( atoms s@xmath23 ) , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the activation energies for diffusion and desorption were taken as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 mev .",
    "the grain temperature was @xmath84k .",
    "the parameters used for hydrogen are the experimental results for low density amorphous ice @xcite . for the other species",
    "there are no concrete experimental results , and the values reflect the tendency of heavier species to bind more strongly .",
    "the fluxes and grain temperatures are suitable for dense molecular clouds .",
    "consider the case in which a flux of co molecules is added to the network .",
    "this gives rise to the network shown in fig .",

    "two other reactions that involve oxygen atoms also take place : o + co @xmath9 co@xmath0 and o + hco @xmath9 co@xmath0 + h. this network was studied before using the multiplane method , which required about a thousand equations compared to about a million equations in the master equation with similar cutoffs @xcite .",
    "the moment equations include one equation for each node and one for each edge , namely , the network shown in fig . [ fig:2 ] requires only 17 equations .",

    "note that experiments on co desorption from ice surfaces indicate that @xmath98 should be slightly higher than the value used here @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that using a higher value would compromise the feasibility of the master equation simulations , which are required here in order to establish the validity of the moment equation method .",
    "when simulating highly complex networks one encounters the problem of obtaining the equations themselves .",
    "the ability to automate the construction of the equations becomes important .",
