    "linear optical quantum computing has attracted major attention since knill , laflamme and milburn have introduced a scheme for efficient quantum computation in 2001  @xcite . notwithstanding tremendous technological progress",
    ", the experimental realization of such computers is still challenging with steep requirements for the generation , manipulation and detection of the quantum states of light . in the last decade",
    ", integrated quantum photonics  @xcite has become central to the technological progress by providing the means to miniaturize and mass fabricate vital components , such as quantum light sources  @xcite , quantum storage devices  @xcite and highly efficient photon detection on chip  @xcite .",
    "of particular importance is the manipulation of the quantum states of light via linear optical networks ( lons ) . here , integrated quantum photonics enabled the fabrication of lons with unprecedented levels of interferometric complexity .",
    "the inventory includes optical elements , facilitating either fixed  @xcite or tunable  @xcite single - qubit transformations but also novel hybride elements  @xcite .",
    "arranging several of these elements allows fabrication of miniaturized versions of logic gates which are essential in quantum information processing .",
    "those gates resemble small to medium scale interferometers and are either tailored to perform a particular task or can be reconfigured for a variety of tasks  @xcite . here ,",
    "the physical encoding scheme , e.g. a dual - rail polarization encoding , determines how these gates , unitary matrices acting on logical qubits , must be compiled from different optical elements .",
    "hence , the overall transformations of these lons are required to be unitary , too .",
    "this poses a challenge for experimental realizations which are inevitably afflicted by imperfections . here , the major contributors are on one hand losses , which render these devices non - norm preserving . on the other hand fabrication imperfections stemming from the production",
    "itself cause deviations between an initially targeted transformation and the implemented one .",
    "obtaining precise knowledge of an optical transformation at hand therefore is important and serves multiple purposes : it allows theoretical modelling of an experiment and allocation of the error budget to different sources of error .",
    "more important , identifying deviations or even defective optical elements is essential for troubleshooting experiments and improving future versions of an optical circuit .",
    "the ability to construct high - fidelity gate operations becomes a stringent requirement when circuits are scaled up beyond proof of principle implementations  @xcite .",
    "since all waveguides are embedded into a bulk material , only the input and output ports and therefore the overall transformation is directly accessible . to acquire knowledge of such an overall transformation one can use different approaches relying on quantum resources  @xcite or classical resources  @xcite",
    "the majority of these techniques fall in the category of quantum process tomography ( qpt ) .",
    "while qpt is well established in quantum science , it faces challenges when applied to large networks due to quickly growing resource costs .",
    "alternative techniques , reconstructing a transition matrix  @xcite or a unitary matrix description  @xcite of a lon , became prominent in the context of bosonsampling  @xcite .",
    "these methods scale more favourably with respect to the required measurements when compared to qpt , and reconstruct matrix descriptions of lons omitting global phases at the input and output ports . methods which rely on light that is scattered out of the lon are not further considered as the technique relies on loss that compromises the guiding properties of the whole structure  @xcite . + here ,",
    "we present a new approach to characterize the transformation implemented by lons .",
    "we choose to enforce unitarity from the start by parametrizing the lons as interferometers composed of beam splitters and phase shifters  @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed unitary matrices are then obtained by optimizing the beam splitting ratios and phase shifts to best explain a set of data sensed via probe states injected into the network .",
    "we utilize a data set composed of two - photon interference visibilities  @xcite , rendering the procedure insensitive to input and output loss . in this way",
    "both afore mentioned purposes of network reconstruction are fulfilled simultaneously ; generating a description to model experimental data and gathering knowledge about the transformation of individual optical elements .",
    "our method is a departure from the strategy of related approaches  @xcite , which aim to reconstruct transition matrices , or do so in a first step  @xcite .",
    "whereas transition matrices are sufficient to characterize a lon and to model experimental results , they do not allow to identify deviations of individual elements directly . here a indirect route via a polar decomposition  @xcite and subsequent decomposition into individual elements must be chosen .",
    "the identification of faulty elements through a decomposition procedure requires lons exhibiting a non - redundant layout , e.g. reck et al .",
    "type networks .",
    "in the following we will compare three approaches to lon characterization .",
    "brisbane  @xcite and bristol  @xcite were chosen for their frequent usage in experiments relying on integrated lons .",
    "our approach , subsequently labelled vienna , is formalizing ideas developed in  @xcite .",
    "similar to  @xcite , an over - complete set of primary data can be used to increase reconstruction fidelities , although we find the effect to be minor ( see figure  [ results : comparison ] ) . in the following",
    ", primary data is referring to data sensed for reconstruction purposes in any of the approaches .",
    "+ the three compared approaches differ in their strategy to characterize a lon . bristol and",
    "brisbane first reconstruct the individual matrix entries of a scattering description and then require a polar decomposition step to recover the closest unitary matrix . both utilize a sufficient set of data for this purpose and in the following we refer to this strategy as a passive approach .",
    "in contrast vienna follows an active approach utilizing a larger set of primary data in a global optimization routine which already implements the unitary constrains from the beginning .",
    "+ the approach brisbane aims to reconstruct a description of a black - box linear optical network from a sufficient set of primary data generated with coherent probe states .",
    "this data is then mapped one to one unto a scattering matrix representation @xmath1 without the need to apply any further algorithms .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath1 represents a submatrix of a larger unitary matrix @xmath2 , where the additional modes of @xmath2 correspond to loss modes .",
    "hence , the task of loss modelling translates to the task of finding a loss matrix that couples the interferometer modes of @xmath1 to the loss modes of @xmath2 .",
    "this necessarily includes input and output loss terms , as the approach processes transition amplitude data .",
    "brisbane covers the case of mode - dependent input loss in the following way : the loss term for each input mode @xmath3 is directly given by the ratio between the total power exiting the lon and the power injected into mode @xmath3 .",
    "subsequently the input loss is modelled by virtual beam splitters , where the square root of the loss terms corresponds to the transmittivity of the virtual beam splitters .",
    "note that such a loss modelling works only in the case when the mode - dependent output loss of the network is zero .",
    "in general , loss inside a network can not be parametrized this way and thus it remains unclear how a more evolved loss modelling can be included in brisbane. hence , only a partially loss modelling scattering description @xmath4 , which is closer to the unitary description @xmath2 than the matrix @xmath1 , can be found via this method .",
    "+ experimental environments exhibiting loss as detailed above cause @xmath4 to be noticeably non - unitary and necessitate a polar decomposition if the closest unitary description @xmath5 is to be obtained . this polar decomposition can introduce further error dependent on the size of the interferometer under test  @xcite .",
    "+ up to the deviations introduced by the polar decomposition the entries of @xmath5 reconstructed via this procedure are identical to the primary data generated .",
    "this self - consistency proves to be challenging when assessing the fidelity and the uncertainty of a reconstructed matrix in the presence of measurement errors .",
    "the complete set of single - input data and phase data is already used to fix the real entries and phases of @xmath1 . to obtain realistic error estimations for the individual entries of @xmath1 or @xmath5",
    ", the various error sources need to be studied in detail , including calibration uncertainty of the detector efficiencies and uncertainties introduced by fiber mating and coupling to a waveguide .",
    "opposed to more complex algorithmic approaches like bristol or vienna , the sensed data can not be used to generate a quantifier for reconstruction success .",
    "an additional set of data generated by different means than coherent states is required for this purpose , e.g. a set of two - photon interference visibilities as done in  @xcite .",
    "+ the approach bristol aims to reconstruct a unitary description of a black - box linear optical network from a set of primary data , which in this case is generated via quantum probe states .",
    "the magnitude of each phase is sensed via a visibility of a non - classical two - photon interference but the sign of the phase needs to be calculated in relation to the other phases such that unitary constraints are obeyed .",
    "note that a phase sensed this way is not a direct phase measurement like in the approach brisbane. furthermore the visibility of each non - classical interference is also modified by the four contributing real entries @xmath6 of the scattering matrix , with @xmath7 and @xmath3 labelling the output and input modes , respectively .",
    "these transition amplitudes are calculated in a fashion insensitive to mode - dependent input and output loss : the loss terms drop out by relating all input and output single - photon count rates to each other .",
    "therefore each entry of the reconstructed matrix , @xmath8 , becomes dependent on the whole set of primary data .",
    "all @xmath6 and @xmath9 are recovered by solving a linear system of non - linear equations . again the closest unitary matrix , @xmath5 , can be found by applying a polar decomposition . whereas the method is insensitive to loss at the input and output ports of a lon",
    ", it is sensitive to mode - dependent propagation loss .",
    "the latter introduces systematic error in the algorithm , already before applying the polar decomposition ( further detail on the influence of mode - dependent propagation loss for all three reconstruction approaches is given in appendix d ) .",
    "ultimately , the combination of the non - linear dependencies in the algorithmic approach with just a sufficient set of data leads to a lower performance of bristol with respect to brisbane and vienna. +     from a lon described by the unitary matrix @xmath10 is measured .",
    "in general this data will be error afflicted denoted by the tilde .",
    "the layout and initial parameters @xmath11 are either known from fabrication ( dashed arrow ) or are obtained by a reconstruction step , e.g. brisbane. these initial parameters are now subjected to a global optimization using an , in the best case over - complete , set of primary data . here",
    "the output yields both , the reconstructed unitary @xmath12 and the parameters of the individual building blocks @xmath13.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    our new approach vienna aims to reconstruct the unitary matrix descriptions @xmath10 of a lon via a global optimization of optical element parameters , @xmath11 , which is visualized in figure  [ methods : flowchart ] as a flowchart . for purpose - built networks , e.g. quantum logic gates ,",
    "the physical layout of the optical elements and their target parameters are defined by the encoding scheme and type of gate .",
    "if they are sufficiently precise , these target parameters can serve as initial guesses for @xmath11 and therefore as the starting parameters in the optimization routine .",
    "black - box @xmath14 lons can be represented by an arrangement of @xmath15 beam splitters and @xmath16 phase shifters  @xcite ( see the appendix for a sketch ) . in our approach",
    "it is sufficient to obtain just one representation of the physical network decomposed in such a way .",
    "however , without any knowledge of the starting values the minimization of the @xmath17-dimensional landscapes is prone to converge into some local minimum only .",
    "hence the starting values need to be obtained by different means . here",
    "we utilize one of the passive reconstruction approaches and find that the approach brisbane is better suited for this purpose than the approach bristol. note that both approaches lead to reconstructed unitaries that are equivalent to the unitary decomposed via the reck et al .",
    "scheme modulo diagonal phase matrices .",
    "these diagonal phase matrices do not affect the extraction of the starting parameters  @xcite . to reconstruct @xmath18 a set of primary data , @xmath19 , is recorded , where @xmath20 denotes the full set of two - photon interference visibilities and @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the full set of normalized transition amplitudes and relative phases sensed via coherent states , respectively . ] .",
    "this data will be in general error afflicted indicated by the tilde .",
    "@xmath23 are only used in the case of black - box networks to obtain the initial starting parameters for the global optimization .",
    "finally , a global cost function using an over - complete set of two - photon interference visibilities , @xmath20 , is minimized to obtain optimal reconstructed parameters @xmath13 .",
    "these automatically yield the reconstructed unitary @xmath12 . optimizing a global cost function",
    "comes with an additional advantage : the minimum of that function can act as an direct estimator for the success of the reconstruction and is in our case identical to the @xmath24  @xcite , allowing further statistical interpretation .",
    "we choose to utilize just two - photon interference visibilities for the reconstruction of @xmath12 .",
    "these visibilities are insensitive to input and output loss , thus @xmath12 represents a unitary description modulo loss matrices at the input and output .",
    "the parameters of these loss matrices can be easily recovered by using loss sensitive data such as transition amplitude data , @xmath21 , and solving a system of linear equations utilizing the reconstructed description @xmath12 .",
    "we compare the reconstruction results for the different approaches brisbane , bristol and vienna numerically for fully coupled @xmath14 networks in the presence of perturbance on the primary data . to quantify the performance of the different approaches the fidelity between the initially generated haar - random unitary matrix , @xmath25 , and the reconstructed unitary matrix @xmath26 is calculated .",
    "we consider @xmath27 networks with @xmath28 , where @xmath29 labels the reconstruction approach and @xmath30 denotes the level of perturbance on the primary data ( see appendix a for further details ) .",
    "losses are kept zero to allow for a fair comparison between loss sensitive and insensitive approaches . for each network size , @xmath31 haar - random unitary matrices are generated ( labelled by @xmath7 ) matrices are sampled due to the dispersed results . ] to ensure that random properties of a @xmath7th unitary , e.g. symmetry , do not lead to biased results .",
    "the unitary descriptions are calculated via a monte carlo method drawing the data required for each reconstruction approach , @xmath29 , randomly from the set of perturbed data , @xmath32 .",
    "an average unitary description , @xmath26 , is obtained after @xmath31 iterations with @xmath33 denoting its standard deviation .",
    "we use the fidelity measure ,    @xmath34    which is normalized by the number of modes , @xmath35 , such that it is insensitive to the network size . here",
    ", @xmath36 denotes the trace norm . for given @xmath37",
    "the resulting fidelity histograms are fitted with weibull distributions centred around the most probable value , @xmath38 ( see appendix a ) . as an error measure , @xmath39 , the distances between the most probable fidelity and the two fidelities where the maximum probability decreased to @xmath40 are used .",
    "the most probable fidelities and their respective uncertainties for @xmath41 different combinations of network size and perturbance on the primary data are recovered for each of the reconstruction approaches .",
    "figure  [ results : comparison ] shows a representative example , once for @xmath42 networks and variable error on the primary data , @xmath30 , and once for an error of @xmath43 and variable network size .",
    "clear differences between the approaches can be observed with respect to the overall performance , the scaling and the dispersive behaviour .",
    "such differences must be attributed to specifics of the reconstruction algorithms as all approaches reconstruct the same unitaries @xmath25 .     for the case of @xmath42 networks , whereas * ( b ) * shows the scaling dependent on the size of the @xmath27 networks for @xmath43 . * ( a ) * and * ( b ) * intersect , indicated by the dashed grey boxes.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    the approach brisbane shows high reconstruction fidelities with low dispersion which scale linearly with the error , @xmath30 , on the primary data ( figure [ results : comparison]*(a ) * ) . here ,",
    "an upper bound to the deviation of the reconstructed unitaries , @xmath44 , from the initial one , @xmath25 , in the frobenius norm can be even given analytically : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the reconstructed matrix before applying a polar decomposition and its condition number , respectively .",
    "hence the deviation , @xmath48 , stems from the polar decomposition , which in turn is due to the errors of the primary data that contribute in first order approximation as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the data shown in figure [ results : comparison]*(b ) * indicates , that the performance of the approach brisbane is only slightly affected by the network size . + the reconstruction fidelities yielded with the approach bristol are dominated by a ( sub)exponential decay , both as a function of the error on the primary data and the network size .",
    "this also leads to a highly dispersive behaviour which is reflected in the comparably large error bars in figure [ results : comparison ] .",
    "while the exponential decay is already observed in the original publication  @xcite , this just represents a phenomenological fit to the data .",
    "we conjecture that on one hand this scaling originates from the additional matrix inversion that has to be taken into account when the transition amplitudes are calculated . on the other hand , the primary data undergoes a more complex algebraic transformation , which , dependent on the noise of the primary data , can cause unfavourable amplification of perturbations . + reconstructing the unitary description of unknown @xmath27 networks via the approach vienna or vienna reduced works with highest fidelity and minimal uncertainty . here",
    ", vienna reduced denotes a variant of vienna utilizing a smaller set of primary data ( see appendix c for further information ) .",
    "this behaviour can be primarily attributed to the natural implementation of the unitary constraints in the algorithm .",
    "the statistical advantage of a full over - complete set of primary data as used in vienna over a smaller set of primary data as used in vienna reduced is noticeable , albeit being small . for both approaches",
    "we find that errors on the starting parameters are of greater impact than errors on the primary data sets of two - photon visibilities .",
    "this was tested via a separate numeric evaluation .",
    "all starting parameters are extracted using the approach brisbane and as a consequence the scaling with the error on the primary data , @xmath30 , is inherited for large @xmath30 .",
    "a better scaling is found for small @xmath30 , as more precise starting parameters increase the chance that the optimization routine will converge into the global minimum .",
    "both , vienna and vienna reduced , exhibit negligible dependence on the size of the @xmath27 networks .",
    "precise knowledge about the optical transformation of lons is a requirement for the validation of experimental results against theoretical predictions in numerous experiments  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the optical transformations can be given either in terms of scattering descriptions or unitary transformations , where the latter allow a decomposition into individual building blocks .",
    "hence the element parameters for each optical element in the lon can be obtained . from a technological point of view",
    "this is beneficial as it enables the localization of erroneous elements . here",
    "we present a new approach , vienna , and compare it to two prominently used approaches , brisbane and bristol. we investigate all approaches for the regime of zero mode - dependent loss and quantify the differences in reconstruction performance of unitary descriptions via an extensive numerical evaluation : more than @xmath51 @xmath27 black - box networks are sampled for distinct @xmath35 from primary data exhibiting various levels of perturbance .",
    "the results substantiate that the direct implementation of the unitary constraints , as done in the approach vienna , are of advantage for highest reconstruction fidelities .",

    "since the transition amplitudes are loss afflicted they are not used in the global optimization routine of vienna. only in the case that vienna is applied to black - box networks the @xmath79 transition amplitudes and @xmath98 relative phases are needed to extract the starting parameters for the global optimization . furthermore this global optimization allows for an adaptive strategy ; best reconstruction accuracy is achieved using the full over - complete set of data . alternatively , a reduced set of data , the set of all possible two - photon interference visibilities that can be generated when one photon is always inserted into input port one and the second photon into input port @xmath102 , can be used .",
    "this results in a reduced set of @xmath103 visibilities which always suffices to reconstruct @xmath27 networks with @xmath104 modes . in the following",
    "we will refer to the reconstruction approach vienna utilizing a reduced set of primary data as vienna reduced. + a second number , the required measurement runs to generate the primary data set , can be regarded as the experimentally more relevant parameter .",
    "we list this parameter for the reconstruction approaches compared here in the limit that every output mode is coupled to an individual detector in table  [ tab : cost2 ] .",
    "now , all output events for a given input combination can be recorded in parallel , thus the number of required measurements corresponds to the required input combinations that need to be consecutively aligned in a laboratory .",
    "for instance , the @xmath79 transition amplitude data can be acquired in @xmath35 measurement runs and the @xmath105 two - photon interference visibilities in @xmath106 measurement runs .",

    "loss can be a major factor in experiments using integrated optical circuits . in the case of direct laser - written networks",
    "propagation loss of @xmath120 and coupling loss of @xmath121 are typical values  @xcite .",
    "if these losses are mode - independent , however , they just represent a global loss term that commutes with the optical transformation of a lon .",
    "in contrast , mode - dependent losses cause deviations in a targeted optical transformation . characterizing mode - dependent losses thus becomes important when reconstructing the optical transformation of a lon .",
    "here , we distinguish between the case of mode - dependent loss at the input and output ports and the case of mode - dependent propagation loss . in the first case ,",
    "loss can always be separated from the transformation of a lon and be described by loss matrices containing virtual beam splitters . for a @xmath14 lon",
    "this translates to @xmath35 additional parameters modelling input loss and @xmath35 additional parameters modelling output loss , the @xmath122 and @xmath123 of figure  [ fig:4times4loss ] , respectively .",
    "the unitary matrix of the lon expanded by the @xmath124 loss modes now reads as      with @xmath126 denoting the @xmath127 loss matrices .",
    "still , only the original @xmath35 input and output modes are experimentally accessible .",
    "note that the data set for relative phases sensed via coherent states , @xmath56 , and the the data set composed of two - photon interference visibilities , @xmath54 , are insensitive to these losses and hence directly reveal information about @xmath128 . whereas @xmath56 just contains information on the non - trivial phases of the interferometer but not on the transition amplitudes , the set of two - photon interference visibilities contains information on both .",
    "this is a unique feature of the latter data set and owed to the quantum nature of the interference .        in comparison , a direct measurement of the transition amplitudes @xmath55",
    "is always afflicted by mode - dependent input and output loss . as a consequence ,",
    "the latter set of data only reveals information on a @xmath14 submatrix of @xmath129 . in our notation",
    "this submatrix corresponds to the upper left @xmath14 submatrix of @xmath129 , that is spanned by the @xmath35 accessible input and output ports . in general , the size of the transition amplitude data set @xmath55 is insufficient to reconstruct all the @xmath124 loss terms in addition to the @xmath79 real entries directly",
    ". therefore , the strategy used in brisbane only works if @xmath35 loss parameters , either all @xmath130 or all @xmath131 , can be neglected ( see also body text ) .",
    "alternatively , the transition amplitude data can be subjected to a reconstruction algorithm in which the loss terms drop out , as done in bristol , however this necessitates unitary constraints .",
    "although the strategy of bristol seems to be of advantage , figure  [ results : comparison ] gives a indication that the algorithm reacts fragile to measurement error on the primary data . in comparison brisbane achieves higher reconstruction fidelities .",
    "this may change in the presence of mode - dependent input and output loss .",
    "it is an open question where the threshold of measurement error on the sensed data opposed to the level of of input and output loss lies , that would favour one over the other algorithm . due to the processing of just two - photon interference visibilities , vienna is insensitive to input and output losses .",
    "hence , @xmath128 is directly reconstructed and the @xmath130 and @xmath131 can be obtained in a separate step by solving a system of linear equations using loss afflicted data , e.g. the set of transition amplitudes @xmath55 . in the case of black - box networks , however , some dependence is carried over if initial starting parameters , @xmath11 , are obtained via , e.g. brisbane. + in contrast to input and output loss , mode - dependent propagation loss can not be separated from the unitary description of a lon , as it does not commute with the optical elements that constitute the network s fundamental transformation .",
    "instead , the unitary description needs to be expanded by additional in - circuit loss modes , subsequently labelled @xmath80 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig:4times4loss]b ) for the case of a @xmath73 circuit , where the @xmath132 denote the parameters of the loss modelling beam splitters . for general @xmath27 lons which follow the reck et al .",
    "layout this translates to @xmath133 additional modes .",
    "now the unitary can be written as      with @xmath35 the number of accessible network - modes , @xmath135 the total number of modes and @xmath136 denoting the @xmath137 input and output loss matrices .",
    "all data sets sensed for reconstruction purposes , @xmath138 reveal information about an in general non - unitary submatrix of @xmath139 . in our notation , this submatrix corresponds to the upper left @xmath14 submatrix of @xmath139 .",
    "now , the above mentioned strategies to model loss fail .",
    "the loss terms can not be assessed directly and error is introduced by applying unitary constrains to the non - unitary @xmath14 submatrix .",
    "+ we numerically evaluate the exemplary case of @xmath65 lons to investigate how severe the reconstruction performance of the various approaches is offset by mode - dependent in - circuit loss .",
    "the general layout of these networks is shown in figure  [ fig:4times4loss]*b)*. here , the input and output losses are kept zero to ensure that they do not influence the results . thus the networks are just expanded by @xmath140 in - circuit loss modes .",
    "the approaches brisbane and bristol are constructed to obtain @xmath73 descriptions which prevents the use of the fidelity measure defined in equation  [ eq : fid ] .",
    "hence we use an alternative measure which is experimentally motivated and constructed as the mean deviation between a point of primary data and its prediction obtained via one of the reconstructed descriptions .",
    "@xmath141 quantifies the mean deviation for the normalized transition - amplitude data and @xmath142 the mean deviation for the two - photon interference visibilities ( see definition below ) . in the limit of @xmath143 ,",
    "perfect reconstruction is achieved , a result only expected if in - circuit loss is either zero or if it can be fully recovered by an approach .",
    "one option to achieve the latter is a reconstruction of the complete @xmath144 unitary description , which we investigate for the approach vienna. the required starting parameters for the @xmath145 and @xmath146 used to initialize to optimization routine are extracted via the approach brisbane. all @xmath132 are initialized at zero .",
    "the data presented in figure  [ fig : lossyresults ] is sampled for different levels of loss by drawing the transmittances of the loss beam splitters , @xmath147 , randomly from a uniform distribution @xmath148 $ ] . in the worst case of @xmath149 ,",
    "the maximum loss per beam splitter thus is @xmath150 . to sample the unitary space representative , @xmath151 different @xmath42 starting matrices",
    "are generated for each loss - interval .",
    "the general perturbance on the primary data was set to @xmath152 .",
    "all reconstructed descriptions are computed in the same way as in section  [ sec : results ] via a monte carlo method with a sampling size of @xmath153 ( see also appendix a ) . the resulting frequency histograms for @xmath141 ,",
    "@xmath142 and the fidelity histograms in the case of vienna were fitted with burr type xii distributions  @xcite , as these show good overlap with the numerical data .",
    "the data points and error bars contained within figure  [ fig : lossyresults ] are given as the most probable value of the distributions and the distance between the most probable value and those values to the left and right where the maximum probability decreases to @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "+ already for the small levels of mode - dependent propagation loss considered here , all three approaches struggle to reconstruct precise unitary descriptions .",
    "this result is to be expected in the case of brisbane and bristol as the sets of data used for the reconstruction procedures originate from a non - unitary submatrix .",
    "hence only closest unitary descriptions are reconstructed , which in turn can not fully explain the original data sets .",
    "+ the results obtained in the case of vienna need to be interpreted in a different way . whereas the global optimization of just two - photon interference visibilities converges , as can be seen by the values for @xmath142 in figure  [ fig : lossyresults]*b ) * ,",
    "the values obtained for @xmath141 show a scaling similar to the other two approaches .",
    "this indicates that the original optical element parameters for the beam splitters , phase shifters and loss beam splitters can not be recovered with high accuracy . as a result",
    "the fidelities of the reconstructed @xmath154 unitary matrices decrease rapidly with growing @xmath155 .",
    "it is an open question whether a larger set of primary data including relative phase shifts @xmath156 would yield improved reconstruction results . in light of the above",
