    "ammonia ( nh@xmath3 ) is an extremely useful molecular tool for studying the interstellar medium .",
    "many inversion transitions occur in the easily observable 12 mm band .",
    "they include transitions from both metastable ( j = k ) and non - metastable ( j@xmath4k ) levels of ammonia .",
    "hyperfine structure in the metastable transitions is commonly seen , which can be used to derive optical depths , whereas comparison of different ( j , k ) transitions can yield information on the rotational temperature ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the first suggestion that ammonia may display maser action in interstellar space was made by @xcite who noted that ( 3,3 ) emission toward w33 was not matched by ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 4,4 ) transitions , which were all in absorption .",
    "they suggested that this may be due to a weak population inversion .",
    "maser emission in ammonia transitions was first unambiguously identified by @xcite in the ( 9,6 ) and ( 6,3 ) transitions , shortly followed by @xcite in the ( 3,3 ) transition of @xmath5nh@xmath3 .",
    "in addition to these transitions , ammonia masers have been detected in the following transitions : ( 5,4 ) ( 7,5 ) , ( 9,8 ) , ( 10,8 ) @xcite , ( 6,5 ) @xcite , ( 5,5 ) @xcite , ( 6,6 ) @xcite and ( 1,1 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath6nh@xmath3 ( 3,3 ) masers were first detected by @xcite .",
    "pumping mechanisms for most ammonia masers remain unclear .",
    "metastable transitions of ortho - ammonia , like ( 3,3 ) are thought to be collisionally excited @xcite but such a mechanism will only work for non - metastable transitions where exceedingly high h@xmath7 densities between @xmath8 @xmath9 are found ( eg .",
    "@xcite suggest two alternative pumping mechanisms for non - metastable transitions : either pumping by a strong infrared radiation field , such as found around a deeply embedded high mass star , or by a fortuitous overlap of a far - infrared line , which allows a population transfer from a ( j , k ) inversion level to ( j+1 , k ) .",
    "ammonia masers are found in regions of high mass star formation , with the best known example being w51 @xcite , with other prominent examples being g9.62 + 0.19 @xcite and ngc6334i @xcite .",
    "ngc6334i forms the focus of this work .",
    "it is a nearby ( 1.7kpc , @xcite ) region of high mass star formation , traced by bright infrared emission , an ultracompact ( uc ) hii region , mm continuum sources and methanol maser sites .",
    "see @xcite for a more comprehensive summary of characteristics of the region .",
    "the initial observations were undertaken with the 22 m mopra telescope near siding spring , australia .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of ngc6334i at 17 20 53.43 , @xmath1035 47 2.2 ( j2000 ) using position switching on 2006",
    "november 28@xmath11 .",
    "we used the new mopra spectrometer ( mops ) in broadband mode , which affords us four overlapping ifs of 2.2ghz each .",
    "thus , we were able to instantaneously cover 8ghz of frequency space between 19.5 and 27.5ghz .",
    "each if has 8192 channels , resulting in a channel width of 269khz , equivalent to 4.1  at 19.5ghz or 2.9  at 27.5ghz .",
    "the observations consisted of approximately 10 hours total integration ( 5 hours on source ) with an rms noise level of between 0.01 and 0.03k .",
    "the follow - up observations were undertaken on 2007 may 3@xmath12 on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in director s time .",
    "the correlator setting was full_256_64_256_64 , allowing 0.89  velocity resolution .",
    "the primary beam was 2.3  and the array configuration was 1.5c , with baselines ranging from 77 to 4500 m providing an angular resolution of @xmath131 .",
    "the two frequencies were tuned to cover the ammonia ( 8,6 ) transition at 20.719221ghz and the ( 11,9 ) transition at 21.070739ghz .",
    "these transitions were chosen for atca observations as they appeared the brightest of previously undetected ammonia maser in the mopra spectrum .",
    "the region was observed for 9@xmath020 minute cuts in each transition separated over 5 hours . a bright",
    "( @xmath41 jy ) , close ( @xmath145@xmath15 ) phase calibrator was observed for 3 minutes before and after each cut . @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 were used as the bandpass and primary calibrator , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using the miriad package .",
    "bad visibilities were flagged , edge channels removed and the gains / bandpass solutions from the calibrator were applied to the visibilities .",
    "the data were fourier transformed to form image cubes with 0.2@xmath18 pixels using natural weighting .",
    "the images were _ _",
    "clean__ed down to 3@xmath19 above the noise to remove sidelobes then convolved with a gaussian beam of the synthesised beam size to produce a final _ _ restor__ed image .",
    "continuum emission was extracted from a low - order polynomial fit to line - free channels using _ uvlin _ and images were made from these visibilities in the same way . from previous observations of the primary calibrator , @xmath20 , errors in the absolute flux scale are estimated to be @xmath1310% .",
    "noise levels were 6mjy / beam at the frequency of the ( 8,6 ) transition and 3.5mjy / beam at the frequency of the ( 11,9 ) transition .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows radio continuum emission contours overlaid on thermal ammonia ( 4,4 ) emission @xcite . the ( 4,4 ) emission corresponds well to two mm continuum sources i - sma1 and i - sma2 @xcite .",
    "we find , in the atca observations , that emission in both the ( 8,6 ) and ( 11,9 ) transitions is unresolved .",
    "we consider these to be masers , for reasons given below .",
    "because the emission is unresolved , we do not provide maps of each , but rather show symbols on figure [ fig1 ] to represent the positions of the maser emission . within positional errors",
    "( typically 1  for the atca ) , all masers appear to be coincident .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the spectra of each line .",
    "we measure fluxes of 53 and 3.5jy for the ( 8,6 ) and ( 11,9 ) transitions , respectively .",
    "these agree within errors to the respective mopra fluxes of 48jy and 3.2jy , implying there is no significant extended emission that might have been missed by the atca obaservations .",
    "therefore , we can be sure the emission comes from a region no bigger than the atca beam of 2.7@xmath0 0.8 .",
    "we calculate peak brightness temperature lower limits based on equation [ eq1 ] @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the observing wavelength in millimetres and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the deconvolved major and minor axes in arcseconds , respectively .",
    "we find the ( 8,6 ) emission has a deconvolved size of 0.9@xmath0 0.2and the ( 11,9 ) emission has a deconvolved size of 0.7@xmath0 0.1 .",
    "we therefore calculate peak brightness temperatures of 7.8 @xmath25k for the ( 8,6 ) transition and 1.2 @xmath25k for the ( 11,9 ) transition .",
    "if the emission is thermal , it would require a local exciting source with a temperature in excess of these values which we consider extremely unlikely .",
    "thus we interpret emission in both lines as masers .",
    "together with the ( 6,6 ) transition reported to be masing by @xcite , we have identified three masing transitions of ortho - ammonia .",
    "are there any other transitions of ortho - ammonia that are masing ?",
    "our single - dish mopra observations of ngc6334i suggest there may be others . we detect narrow - lined emission in the ( 7,6 ) , ( 10,9 ) and ( 9,9 ) transitions , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] . although the strengths of each of these lines is not enough to conclusively identify them as masers , there is some circumstantial evidence that they may well be masers .",
    "they all exhibit line widths less than 3.8 , which is close to the velocity resolution of the mopra observations .",
    "indeed , the atca observations , with finer velocity resolution show both the ( 8,6 ) and ( 11,9 ) lines to have line widths of 1.3 .",
    "in contrast to this , all other detected ammonia lines in the mopra spectrum have line widths between 5.8 and 7.3 , and are clearly resolved in velocity . apart from their narrow line widths , emission in each of these transitions peaks around 5 , as for the established ( 6,6 ) , ( 8,6 ) and ( 11,9 ) masers .",
    "this is distinctively different from thermal emission , which peaks between -3 and -10 .",
    "thermal emission is traced by ammonia ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ch@xmath3oh ( 2@xmath26  2@xmath27 ) @xcite , as well as ammonia ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) and ( 6,6 ) @xcite .",
    "note that the ammonia ( 6,6 ) observations identified both thermal and maser emission that were clearly separated in velocity .",
    "we note that the mopra spectrum covers many other lines of ammonia between 19.5 and 27.5ghz and whilst some of these lines do show emission , it appears all others exhibit broader emission features peaking around -3 and -10  and so are almost certainly thermal emission .",
    "we also note that all the potential masing transitions arise from ortho - ammonia .",
    "it is not clear why we do not see any para - ammonia masers in ngc6334i .",
    "oh ( @xmath28).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    three methods for creating a population inversion of the ammonia upper levels are through collisional excitation , excitation by infrared radiation or a fortuitous alignment of a molecular transition that allows a ( j , k ) transition to populate the ( j+1,k ) upper level @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that collisional excitation is at work here because extremely high densities ( @xmath29 ) are required .",
    "since we see at least three masing transitions , and perhaps six , it is unlikely this is due to many lucky alignments of molecular transitions allowing population of the non - metastable states .",
    "therefore , we believe the pumping mechanism for ammonia masers in ngc6334i must be via infrared photons .",
    "this case is strengthened as ngc6334i is known to be one of the brightest infrared sources in our sky , being intrinsically luminous and relatively nearby ( 1.7kpc ) .",
    "this may also explain why these new masers only show thermal emission in other regions .",
    "the detection of new ammonia masers in ngc6334i indicates that this source is fertile ground for ammonia maser research .",
    "confirmation ( or otherwise ) of the potential ( 7,6 ) , ( 10,9 ) and ( 9,9 ) masers , as well as searching for other non - metastable transitions of ortho - ammonia may yield more maser detections , which will greatly increase the chances of developing theoretical models for ammonia maser pumping and hopefully will lead to a better understanding of ngc6334i , which gives rise to these rare masers .",
    "we have observed the two non - metastable transitions of ammonia : ( 8,6 ) and ( 11,9 ) , using the atca .",
    "the ( 8,6 ) transition has a peak brightness temperature of 7.8 @xmath25k , whereas the ( 11,9 ) transition has a peak brightness temperature of 1.2 @xmath25k , indicating that both are masers .",
    "the ( 11,9 ) transition is e@xmath30k above ground making it the highest energy ammonia maser currently known .",
    "the position of both masers is consistent with being coincident , to within positional uncertainties , with maser emission in the previously detected ( 6,6 ) transition @xcite .",
    "single - dish observations of ( 7,6 ) , ( 9,9 ) and ( 10,9 ) suggest they may also be masers based on their narrow line widths and overlapping velocity range with the above - mentioned masers , which is distinctly different from the thermal emission systemic velocity .",
    "high spatial resolution observations of these transitions are planned to decide whether or not these are masers as well .",

    "we would also like to thank henrik beuther for provision of ammonia and continuum data used in this work .",
    "we would also like to thank paul ho , the referee , who has greatly helped improve the quality of this work .",
