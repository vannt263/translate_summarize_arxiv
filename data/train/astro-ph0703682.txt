    "of the light nuclides produced in astrophysically interesting abundances ( d , he , he , li ) during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , deuterium is the baryometer of choice for several reasons .",
    "for example , the bbn - predicted primordial deuterium abundance is sensitive to the baryon ( nucleon ) density [ @xmath3(d / h)@xmath4 where @xmath5 and the post - bbn evolution of d is simple and monotonic : as gas cycles through stars , deuterium is only destroyed ( epstein , lattimer & schramm 1976 ; prodanovi & fields 2003 ) .",
    "a consequence of this simple evolution is that the post - bbn deuterium abundance is a probe of the fraction of the interstellar gas which has never been cycled through stars ( steigman & tosi 1992 , 1995 ) . models of the chemical evolution of the galaxy , constrained by observations of the stellar and gas phase metal abundances , follow the history of the gas . as a bonus",
    "they predict the time - evolution of the deuterium abundance . until relatively recently observations of deuterium in the universe were limited to the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy , so that determinations of primordial deuterium required the input of chemical evolution models and , hence , were model - dependent ( steigman & tosi 1992 , 1995 ; vangioni - flam , olive & prantzos 1994 ; prantzos 1996 ; tosi 1996 ; scully et al .",
    "1997 ; tosi et al .",
    "this changed with the advent of large , ground - based telescopes and with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which have enabled determinations of the d abundance along the lines - of - sight ( los ) to a few ( at present , six ) high - redshift , low - metallicity qso absorption line systems ( qsoals ; kirkman et al .",
    "2003 ; omeara et al .",
    "2006 ) . at the same time observations of the angular distribution of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) , in combination with new data on the large - scale structure of the universe ( see , e.g. , spergel et al . 2006 ; tegmark et al . 2006 ) , have constrained the baryon abundance to @xmath6 , @xmath7 , leading to a bbn - predicted primordial d abundance accurate to @xmath8  5  6  % , @xmath9 . starting with this primordial abundance , what do galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models predict for the current local ism deuterium abundance and how well",
    "do these predictions compare to observations ?",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "the predicted and observed abundances of d and o in the local ism are reviewed and compared , accounting for depletion onto dust grains as well as localized infall of metal - poor , d - enhanced gas .",
    "the implications of ism inhomogeneities are further discussed in section  3 .",
    "finally , in section  4 we draw our conclusions .",
    "as gas cycles through stars , d is destroyed and the abundances of the  metals \" , in particular oxygen , increase ( from zero primordially ) . in addition to star formation , gas flows play a fundamental rle in determining the chemical composition of gas and stars in galaxies .",
    "in particular , infall of primordial , or nearly primordial , gas plays a crucial rle in the chemical evolution of our own galaxy , enhancing the ism d abundance , restoring it closer to its primordial value ( see , e.g. , tosi 1988a , b ) . as a result",
    "the ism deuterium abundance is not expected to depart from its primordial value until the ism metallicity increases to @xmath10 solar ( romano et al .",
    "underlying gce models is the  conventional wisdom \" that the local ism is chemically homogeneous ( i.e. the timescale for mixing in the local ism is much shorter than stellar / chemical evolution timescales ) .",
    "consequently , gce models predict mean abundances for deuterium and the metals , e.g. oxygen , in the vicinity of the sun at the present time .",
    "the data obtained from the far ultraviolet satellite explorer ( fuse ; oliveira et al .",
    "2006 ; oliveira & hbrard 2006 ) , however , reveal a factor three range for the d abundance and an even larger range for the o abundance , clearly in conflict with this simplifying assumption .",
    "the gas phase abundances of d and o are currently not distributed homogeneously in the local ism .",
    "the gce model - predicted ism abundance of d is related to the primordial d abundance through the  astration \" factor , @xmath11 .",
    "many gce models are found in the literature which address d evolution in the milky way .",
    "generally , they adopt different prescriptions for the star formation rate , infall and outflow rates , initial mass function ( imf ) and stellar lifetimes ( see , e.g. , vangioni - flam et al .",

    "recent models ( romano et al .",
    "2006 ) in which the prescriptions of the stellar imf and stellar lifetimes ( scalo 1986 ; kroupa , tout & gilmore 1993 ; maeder & meynet 1989 ; schaller et al . 1992 ) are allowed to change , predict that the astration factor and the current ism oxygen abundances lie in the ranges , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16(o / h ) . for a bbn - predicted primordial d abundance of @xmath17 ,",
    "the gce - predicted ism d abundance is expected to lie in the range , @xmath18 .",
    "there are at least two physical effects capable of accounting for the observed variations in d and o abundances along different los within @xmath19  kpc of the sun .",
    "for an explanation of the variable deuterium abundances linsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) embrace the suggestion of draine ( 2004 ) , based on earlier work of jura ( 1982 ) , that deuterium may be preferentially depleted ( compared to hydrogen ) onto dust grains . while linsky et al .",
    "do not address the variation in oxygen abundances , depletion might provide a viable explanation for the dispersion among the observed oxygen abundances as well .",
    "another possibility is recent infall to the disk of the galaxy of unprocessed ( d - rich , o - poor ) material which has been incompletely mixed in the ism ( see also geiss , gloeckler & charbonnel 2002 ) . in this case",
    "there would be an anti - correlation between the d and o abundances observed along such contaminated los .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the  true \" ism abundances and @xmath22 and @xmath23 the abundances observed along a specific los , then incompletely mixed infall predicts y_d^obs = y_dp + ( y_d^ism - y_dp)y_o^obs / y_o^ism .",
    "for example , if the scalo ( 1986 ) imf along with the stellar lifetimes of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) are adopted , then according to romano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , so that y_d^obs = 2.61 - 0.087y_o^obs [ dvsoinf ] is predicted .",
    "since fuse is often unable to provide sufficiently accurate  column densities , to interpret these data people usually rely on  column density determinations from other telescopes / observers . as a result , it is possible that some of the dispersion among the observed d and o abundances may be due to systematic errors in the associated  column densities ( timmes et al .",
    "1997 ; hbrard & moos 2003 ; steigman 2003 ) .",
    "however , the ratio of d to o is unaffected by such errors . for 10(d / o )",
    "= @xmath26 , eq .  [ dvsoinf ] predicts 10(d / o ) = 26.1/y_o^obs - 0.87 .",
    "[ dovsoinf ]    of course , it may well be the case that both mechanisms ( depletion and infall ) are at work in the ism .",
    "if so , the anticorrelations described by equations @xmath27 provide an _",
    "upper _ envelope to the observations in the @xmath28 and d / o  planes ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : deplet ] and [ fig : infall ] ) .",
    "infall of ( nearly ) primordial gas is often invoked to account for abundance variations in the ism ( e.g. cartledge et al . 2004 ; knauth , meyer & lauroesch 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the required infall episodes should have occurred recently enough to avoid complete mixing of the ism .",
    "the exact timescale on which clouds of partially ionized gas falling into the magnetized ism will be thoroughly homogenized is not clear . at the same time it is clear that if depletion is the correct explanation for the observed variations in d and o abundances , then local depletions have not been homogenized either .",
    "therefore , although it will be seen below that recent inhomogeneous infall on small ( pc - sized ) scales is _ not required _ to achieve concordance between the observed ism abundances and gce models , neither should it be rejected out of hand as contributing to the observed dispersion among the gas phase d and o abundances .",
    "the abundance of deuterium in the relatively local ism ( within @xmath29  kpc of the sun ) has been explored for some 30 years beginning with observations by the  _ copernicus _ satellite and continuing with a series of space - based uv detectors ( e.g. _ iue _ , _ ghrs _ and  _ stis _ on the hst ) up to the current  _ imaps _ instrument on the fuse satellite .",
    "the most recent and comprehensive abundance analyses are based on the data acquired by fuse ( oliveira et al .",
    "2006 ; linsky et al .",
    "2006 ; oliveira & hbrard 2006 ) .",
    "these data are adopted in our analysis here , together with the abundances in the warm neutral medium of the lower galactic halo recently determined by savage et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "linsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that local variations in the observed gas - phase d / h ratios can be explained by spatial variations in the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains .",
    "while this hypothesis of localized depletion provides a reasonable explanation for the observed variations in the d and o abundances , there is little direct evidence in support of it .",
    "for example , although the fuse observations cover a range of four orders of magnitude in  column density [ @xmath30 logn()@xmath31 21.2 ] , both the lowest and the highest deuterium abundances are found for 19.2@xmath31 logn()@xmath31 21.0 ( see oliveira et al . 2006 , their fig .",
    "17 , upper panel , and oliveira & hbrard 2006 ) .",
    "of course , since the los explored by fuse range in distance ( to the background star ) from tens of parsecs to @xmath29  kpc , high  column density is not equivalent to high gas density . with few exceptions",
    "the fuse data do not permit a direct determination of the local gas density .",
    "a surrogate for the gas density , @xmath32()@xmath33n()/@xmath34 , where @xmath34 is the distance to the background illuminating star , ranges over nearly three orders of magnitude , from @xmath35  @xmath36 to @xmath37  @xmath36 .",
    "while this estimate does nt preclude much higher local densities , the largest of these is smaller than the densities associated with molecular clouds where depletion is expected to be efficient .",
    "furthermore , here too , the evidence in support of d - depletion is ambiguous in that although some of the lowest ( depleted ? ) d abundances are found at the highest values of @xmath32 ( ) , so too are the majority of the highest ( undepleted ? )",
    "d abundances ( see oliveira et al .",
    "2006 , their fig .",
    "19 , upper panel ) .",
    "alternatively , if dust depletion is , indeed , the culprit it might be anticipated that the deuterium and oxygen abundances should be _ anticorrelated _ with the los reddening , as measured by e(b@xmath28v ) or , with the molecular hydrogen fraction .",
    "we explored these possibilities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ext ] for deuterium ) using estimates of e(b@xmath28v ) from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and h@xmath38 data from hoopes et al . (",
    "2003 ) , linsky et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , oliveira & hbrard ( 2006 ) .",
    "we find that although there is a tendency for the lowest ( highest ) deuterium abundances to correspond to the highest ( lowest ) e(b@xmath28v ) values and h@xmath38 fractions , many of the least reddened los , as well as those with the smallest h@xmath38 fractions , where depletion may be less likely , also have _ low _ d abundances .",
    "furthermore , two out of eight los with the highest h@xmath38 fractions ( hd41161 and pg0038 + 199 ) have some of the highest d abundances observed .",
    "similar trends are found for the oxygen abundances [ low o / h at low e(b@xmath28v ) , low h@xmath38 fraction ] .",
    "perhaps the strongest evidence in support of d depletion comes from the correlation between d and ti abundances ( prochaska , tripp & houk 2005 ; but see also hbrard et al .",
    "2005 ) . the fuse data ( oliveira et al .",
    "2006 ; linsky et al .",
    "2006 ; oliveira & hbrard 2006 ) reveal a similar trend between d and fe .",
    "these data , plotted in fig .  [ fig : dvsfe ] , show that the lowest d abundances are , indeed , correlated with the lowest fe abundances [ log  @xmath39 , where @xmath40(fe / h ) ] .",
    "however , these data also suggest that deuterium may be undepleted along several of the los for which log  @xmath41 .",
    "this calls into question the linsky et al .",

    "incompletely mixed infall of unprocessed material would give rise to an _ anticorrelation _ between the d and o abundances . to explore these trends in the fuse data we concentrate on those los with data ( mostly from oliveira et al .",

    "one possible exception may be the los towards lse44 ( friedman et al .",
    "2006 ; see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : deplet ] and [ fig : infall ] ; note that the d / o ratios are unaffected .",
    "the large difference in  and  column densities , @xmath51 orders of magnitude , is a potential source of systematic errors for the d / h determinations .",

    "despite the evidence of 30 years of data to the contrary , until recently the conventional wisdom has been that the local ism is well mixed , with unique abundances of the chemical elements , d and o in particular .",
    "the fuse data , complementing earlier observations , which reveals a factor of three range for d / h ( @xmath56 ) and an even larger dispersion among the o / h ratios ( @xmath57 ) , lays to rest this overly simplified assumption . while linsky et al .",
