    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols @xcite allow two distant parties , traditionally called alice and bob , to produce a shared random bit string consisting of 0 s and 1 s known only to them , which can be used as a key to encrypt and decrypt messages .",
    "based on the fundamental principles such as no - cloning principle @xcite , in quantum physics , qkd provides an unconditionally secure way to distribute random keys through insecure channels . in 1984 ,",
    "the well known bennett - brassard ( bb84 ) protocol was first proposed @xcite .",
    "the first entanglement based qkd protocol was proposed by ekert in 1991 @xcite , where violation of a local realist inequality is used to check the security of qkd , i.e. , if the shared state between alice and bob violates bell s inequality @xcite , then it is possible to generate a secure key .",
    "subsequently , there have been several important theoretical improvements and experimental demonstrations of bb84 and other qkd protocols were discussed in @xcite . in this connection , the violation of the bell s inequality was first monitored in an experiment by jennewein et .",
    "al.@xcite , but no quantitative measure of security was derived from the observed violation .",
    "later , ling et .",
    "@xcite have proposed an experiment on entanglement based qkd in which the violation of bell - chsh inequality is used to also quantify the degree of security .",
    "0.1 cm    in this work , we provide a quantum key distribution scheme in which path - spin entanglement in a single particle ( also known as intraparticle entanglement ) is exploited . in the first phase ( key distribution phase ) , our protocol proceeds like the bb84 protocol with a notable difference in the preparation of the state . in the bb84 protocol , among the four prepared states , two are classical states ( bits ) , and the remaining two are quantum states ( superposition of classical states or qubits ) .",
    "our protocol , on the other hand , relies on all four prepared states which are path - spin entangled single particle states .",
    "the path - spin entanglement is crucial in security analysis , akin to the e91 protocol , as we show later .",
    "our scheme , based on single particle hybrid entangled states thus relies on a combination elements of both the bb84 and the e91 protocols , but with several important differences .",
    "our protocol proceeds as follows . like the bb84 protocol",
    ", we also divide the four states into two groups .",
    "each group contains two orthogonal states , but each state of one group is non - orthogonal to the states of the other group . the non - orthogonality is important in the sense that it provides security to the protocol .",
    "this follows from an important feature ( closely related to no - cloning theorem ) of quantum mechanics which states that if a measurement allows one to gain information about the state of a quantum system , then , in general , the state of this quantum system will be disturbed , unless we know in advance that the possible states of the original quantum system are orthogonal to each other .",
    "alice first prepares four path - spin entangled states and places them into two groups .",
    "she then randomly selects one group and chooses one of the states from it .",
    "thereafter , she sends that state to bob . in the next stage , bob uses two mirrors , phase - shifters and beam splitters .",
    "he is free to play with one of the two settings by randomly adjusting the phase - shifter parameter to @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "then he performs measurements on the path state vector and the spin state vector using a couple of stern - gerlach devices .",
    "the measurement on the spin state vector is performed in two different bases .",
    "this experiment is repeated many times and each time he notes down the measurement outcome of the path and the spin state vector . in the next step",
    ", alice declares the group ( but not the member of the group ) she used in each experiment through an authenticated public channel .",
    "the existence of an authenticated channel between alice and bob , which gives bob an advantage over eve , is essential to the security of qkd . after listening to alice s announcement",
    ", bob informs alice which data should be kept and which ones should be aborted .",
    "the kept data generates the quantum key .",
    "this makes the ending of the initial phase .    in the final phase ( security checking phase ) of our protocol",
    "bob checks whether the generated key is secure .",
    "the final phase goes likethe e91 protocol , but with an additional difference . in the e91 protocol",
    ", bob discards some measurement results which are not used in quantum key generation , but in our protocol the aborted measurement outcomes are used in security check . in this way , we can use each and every experiment either in quantum key generation or in security checking . in the security checking ,",
    "only the aborted cases are considered . in these aborted cases",
    ", alice declares the member of the group , i.e. , the prepared intraparticle entangled state through the authenticated public channel .",
    "bob then uses this information to prepare a mixed state and then checks whether the prepared mixed state violates bell s inequality or not .",
    "if the prepared mixed state violates bell s inequality then the quantum key is considered to be secure , otherwise not . since",
    "this mixed state is a single particle entangled state , the violation of bell s inequality corresponds in this case to the quantum mechanical violation of non - contextuality .",
    "the procedure for demonstrating the violation of contextuality by a single - particle path - spin entangled state was discussed by basu et al .",
    "@xcite using a mach - zehnder type interferometric set - up , and the actual experiment using single neutrons was performed by rauch et al . @xcite .",
    "thus , the security check for the present protocol could be performed practically using this approach .",
    "let us consider a spin-1/2 particle ( say , a neutron ) that has an initial spin polarized state along the @xmath2 ( denoted by @xmath3 ) .",
    "taking into consideration its path ( or position ) variables , the joint path - spin state can be written as @xmath4 are with alice , incident on a beam - splitter ( bs1 ) whose transmission and reflection probabilities are @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively",
    ". any given incident particle can then emerge along either the reflected or the transmitted channel corresponding to the state designated by @xmath7 or @xmath8 respectively . here",
    "we recall that for any given lossless beam - splitter , arguments using the unitarity condition show that for the particles incident on the beam - splitter , the phase shift between the transmitted and the reflected states of particles is essentially @xmath9 . for simplifying our treatment ,",
    "we take the transmission and reflection amplitudes of bs1 and bs2 to be real quantities where @xmath10 .",
    "note that the beam - splitter acts only on the path - states without affecting the spin - state of the particles , while in our argument a crucial role is played by the mutually orthogonal path states @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are eigenstates of the projection operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "these projection operators can be regarded as corresponding to the observables that pertain to the determination of which channel a particle is found to be in .",
    "for example , the results of such a measurement for the reflected ( transmitted ) channel with binary alternatives are given by the eigenvalues of @xmath13 ; the eigen- value + 1(0 ) corresponds to a neutron being found ( not found ) in the channel represented by @xmath14 .",
    "the state of a particle emergent from bs1 can then be written as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 can be represented as @xmath19 next , let us suppose that the particles in the channel corresponding to @xmath20 pass through a spin - flipper ( sf ) ( that contains a uniform magnetic field along , say , the @xmath21 ) which flips the state @xmath17 to @xmath18 . as a consequence of this insertion of a spin - flipper in one of the channels , the particle 1 with alice has now the path - spin entangled state given by @xmath22 quantum key distribution scheme and its security ------------------------------------------------    in this section , we discuss our quantum key distribution scheme .",
    "our protocol goes as follows.0.1 cm    * * a .",
    "intraparticle entanglement prepared by alice**0.5 cm    let us consider the four intraparticle entangled states @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where    @xmath27    the former two intraparticle entangled states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are prepared in a way described in the previous section while the latter two entangled states @xmath25 and @xmath26 are generated when the hadamard gate is applied on the spin state of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we should note that the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not orthogonal to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "alice prepares any one of the above four intrapaticle entangled states randomly and then sends that state to bob .",
    "this event is repeated many times .",
    "-0.1 cm fig . 1 : a spin-@xmath28 particle falls on the beam - splitter bs1 .",
    "a spin - flipper is placed along the transmitted channel , and a phase - shifters applied in the reflected path .",
    "bob uses anothet phase - shifter ( ps2 ) and then recombines the reflected and the transmitted channels . finally , bob performs path and spin measurements using the stern - gerlach devices sg1 and sg2 .",
    "0.5 cm    * b. path and spin measurement by bob * 0.5 cm    bob places the mirrors m1 and m2 along the path @xmath8 and @xmath7 and in addition to this , a phase - shifter ( ps2 ) is also kept along the path @xmath7 that changes the phase of the particle by @xmath29 .",
    "subsequently , bob uses a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs2 ) , to recombine the beams corresponding to @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "the output path states after interacting with beam splitter are given by @xmath30 if alice sends the states @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 , then after emerging from beam splitter ( bs2 ) , the possible resulting states at bob s site are given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "let us consider that bob randomly uses two settings of his apparatus by choosing the value of the phase shifter parameter @xmath29 , say , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if bob chooses @xmath0 then eq.([beamsplitter2 ] ) reduces to @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40.0.1 cm    if bob chooses the setting @xmath1 then he further performs a hadamard gate transformation on the spin qubit and thereafter eq.([beamsplitter2 ] ) reduces to @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45.0.1 cm    using his stern - gerlach devices bob makes path measurement in the basis @xmath46 .",
    "the path state vectors are @xmath47 and @xmath48 with path observable given by @xmath49 the path observable @xmath50 varies according to the magnitude of the phase shift @xmath29 .",
    "it has two eigenvalues @xmath51 .",
