    "the aim of this note is to propose a new extension of the theory of differential forms to the case of singular varieties in characteristic zero and to illustrate that it has very good properties ; unifying a number of ad hoc approaches and allowing a more conceptual understanding of results in the literature .",
    "differential forms play a key role in the study of local and global properties of manifolds and non - singular algebraic varieties .",
    "this principle is confirmed for example by the period isomorphism between algebraic de rham cohomology and singular cohomology , or the classification of singularities arising from the minimal model program in terms of extension properties of differential forms of top degree .",
    "it is well - known that the theory of khler differentials is not well - behaved in the singular case .",
    "various competing generalizations were introduced . in any case",
    "the definition can be traced back to the non - singular case :    * _ khler differential forms _",
    "@xmath1 on @xmath2 and their torsion - free counterpart @xmath3 are obtained as quotients of @xmath4 for an ambient non - singular space @xmath5 . *",

    "* _ reflexive differential forms _ @xmath7}_x$ ] on a normal variety @xmath2 are differential forms on the regular locus @xmath8 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) * using simplicial hyperresolutions du bois @xcite defines complexes of coherent sheaves and in this way  localizes hodge theory  .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new competitor to this field : _ @xmath0-differential forms _ @xmath9 .",
    "we give three characterizations of very different flavor :    1 .",
    "they are the outcome of the sheafification of khler differential forms with respect to the @xmath0-topology on the category of schemes introduced by voevodsky in @xcite ( see definition  [ defn_h ] ) .",
    "they have a simple characterization in birational geometry : given a variety @xmath2 we choose arbitrary resolutions @xmath10 and @xmath11 . then pulling back yields a bijection between the set of @xmath0-differential forms on @xmath2 and the set of khler differential forms on the resolution @xmath12 such that the two pullbacks to @xmath13 coincide .",
    "in other words ( see remark [ rem_simple - formula ] ) , @xmath14 3 .   to give an @xmath0-differential form on a variety @xmath2",
    "is equivalent to give , in a compatible way , for any morphism @xmath6 from a non - singular variety to @xmath2 a khler differential form on @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath16 be a field of characteristic zero and @xmath2 a separated scheme of finite type over @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath17^{f ' } \\ar[d]_\\phi & \\\\ y \\ar[r]_f & x } \\end{array}\\rightarrow \\phi^*\\alpha_{f}=\\alpha_{f'}\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    let us give three reasons why one should consider the @xmath0-topology .",
    "first , any scheme is @xmath0-locally smooth by hironaka s theorem , an obvious technical advantage .",
    "second , khler differential forms on non - singular schemes turn out to satisfy @xmath0-descent ( see theorem [ thm_hdescent ] ) . a variant of this result was first shown by lee in @xcite .",
    "an analogous statement has already been observed in the case of the coarser @xmath18-topology by geisser in @xcite and in the even coarser @xmath19-topology by cortias , haesemeyer , walker and weibel in @xcite .",
    "third , in contrast to the @xmath19 or @xmath18-topology , all proper surjective morphisms and all flat covers are @xmath0-covers . recall that proper covers in the context of de rham cohomology were introduced long ago by deligne in @xcite in order to extend the period isomorphism to the singular case .",
    "we would like to emphasize the flexibility gained by using arbitrary @xmath0-covers .",
    "in many cases , technical difficulties disappear thanks to the machinery .",
    "these technical advantages allow us to prove invariance of @xmath0-differentials for maps with rationally chain connected fibers ( theorem [ thm_rcc ] ) . together with the extension theorem of greb , kebekus , kovcs and peternell in @xcite ,",
    "this implies the following result for varieties whose singularities arise in the minimal model program .",
    "[ thm2 ] on a klt base space : @xmath20}_x(x)$ ] .",
    "the special case of normal toric varieties has already been proved in @xcite theorem 4.1 , see remark  [ rem_toric ] for more details . by theorem  2",
    "we obtain a more conceptual explanation for the existence of pull - back maps for reflexive differential forms on klt base spaces ( see corollary  [ cor - keb - pullback ] ) .",
    "this is the main result in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and theorem 1 together imply theorem 2 .",
    "let us now turn to the study of cohomology of @xmath0-differentials .",
    "the natural notion is cohomology of @xmath0-sheaves .",
    "this does not change anything in the smooth case :    [ thm3 ] on a smooth variety : @xmath21 .",
    "the main computational tool , the blow - up sequence , allows one easily to compute cohomology of singular varieties from the smooth case .",
    "subsequently we will analyze in more detail the relation between the @xmath0-topology on the category of schemes over a scheme @xmath2 and the zariski topology on @xmath2 .",
    "this is useful in two ways :    first , as already realized by lee ( @xcite ) , the new point of view offers a new perspective on the du bois complex of a variety .",
    "it turns out to be the derived push - forward of the @xmath0-differential forms considered as a complex of sheaves in the @xmath0-topology ( theorem [ thm_h - is - dub ] ) . to illustrate the advantage of our language we deduce subsequently a number of well - known properties of the du bois complex .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , we avoid any use of simplicial or cubic hyperresolutions in the construction .",
    "analogous results in terms of the @xmath19-topology were also shown by cortias , haesemeyer , schlichting , walker and weibel as a byproduct of their work on homotopy invariance of algebraic @xmath22-theory , see their series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this leads to the last application .",
    "hypercohomology of the complex of @xmath0-sheaves @xmath9 gives a simple definition of _ algebraic de rham cohomology_. it agrees with the other definitions in the literature .",
    "the question to what extend the analytified sheaves of @xmath0-differential forms resolve the sheaf of locally constant functions is treated in the dissertation @xcite of the second author .    as an application of our techniqeus",
    ", we use the machinery of @xmath0-differential forms to construct the relative de rham cohomology associated with a closed subscheme @xmath23 .",
    "it is the counterpart of relative singular cohomology and needed in the study of the period isomorphism and the period numbers of a general variety , e.g. in the work of kontsevich and zagier on periods @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "its existence and properties have been known to experts , but we are not aware of a good reference .",
    "the obvious definition via the shift of a reduced cone of hyperresolutions makes establishing the properties very difficult .",
    "it is not even clear to us how to write down the knneth morphism .",
    "one possible approach is by using saito s theory of hodge modules , another by a systematic use of the de rham realization of triangulated motives ( see @xcite and @xcite , or @xcite ) . using @xmath0-differentials we are able to write down a simple definition and give straightforward algebraic proofs for basic features such as long exact sequences associated with triples , excision and the knneth formula ( subsection [ ssec_rel - de - rham ] ) .",
    "beilinson in his approach to @xmath24-adic hodge theory ( see @xcite ) also uses the @xmath25-topology in order to study the de rham complex .",
    "his construction is a lot more subtle .",
    "he is working over the ring of integers of a local field of mixed characteristic , i.e. , with integral ( or rather @xmath24-adic ) coefficients .",
    "moreover , his @xmath26 is a projective system of complexes of @xmath0-sheaves which is built on illusie s cotangent complex instead of the cotangent space .",
    "we have not tried to work out the explicit relation to @xmath27 on the generic fibre .",
    "using the @xmath0-topology in the context of de rham cohomology is quite natural : the de rham complex is a homotopy invariant complex of sheaves of @xmath28-vector spaces with transfers . from the general motivic machinery we learn that its cohomology can be equivalently treated in the @xmath0-topology without transfers .",
    "one point we want to demonstrate in our paper is that the @xmath0-sheafification of the individual @xmath29 is also very useful .",
    "the present paper concentrates on differential forms rather than developing a full - blown six functor formalism for @xmath30-modules in the @xmath0-topology .",
    "we have refrained from dealing with differential forms with log poles or with twists by line bundles .",
    "what is also missing is a discussion of grothendieck duality where differential forms also play a key role .",
    "we work in characteristic zero throughout and hope that a modified definition would also work in positive characteristic .",
    "we hope that these aspects will be developed in the future .",
    "the paper consists of two parts .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] through [ sec:5 ] discuss sheaves of differential forms in various topologies",
    ". sections  [ sec_coho ] and  [ sec:7 ] deal with cohomology groups and objects in the derived category .",
    "the goal of sections [ sec:2 ] and [ sec_h ] is to establish @xmath0-descent for differential forms .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] recalls the results of geisser @xcite in his @xmath18-topology and establishes additional properties of differentials forms in the @xmath18-topology .",
    "section [ sec_h ] reviews voevodsky s @xmath0-topology and deduces theorem [ thm1 ] mentioned above .    in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we make the definition of @xmath31 explicit in a number of cases : for @xmath32 , @xmath33 or when @xmath2 has special types of singularities .",
    "section [ sec:5 ] treats the case of klt - singularities .",
    "theorem [ thm2 ] is deduced from the key result on the invariance of @xmath0-differentials for maps with rationally chain connected fibers .",
    "we then turn in section [ sec_coho ] to cohomology of sheaves in the @xmath0-topology in general and to cohomology of @xmath0-differential forms .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:7 ] , we consider the de rham complex of @xmath0-differential forms .",
    "we recover the du bois complex in terms of @xmath0-differential forms .",
    "the section concludes with a simple description of relative algebraic de rham cohomology in terms of @xmath0-differential forms .",
