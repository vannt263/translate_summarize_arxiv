    "the connection between long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and type ic core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) has long been established , beginning with the association of grb980425 with sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "subsequent associations between nearby grbs and spectroscopically - confirmed sne include grb030329/sn2003dh @xcite , grb031203/sn2003lw @xcite and most recently grb060218/sn2006aj @xcite .",
    "these are spectroscopically confirmed examples of nearby grb - sn associations ( out to @xmath2 ) .",
    "the characteristic ` bump ' of a supernova has been noted in the photometric data for a dozen or more grbs out to @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the majority of grbs lie at higher redshifts where such signatures would be impossible to detect ( @xmath4 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the grbs with sne are therefore rare , but provide a crucial insight into the grb ",
    "sn connection and the progenitors of long grbs .",
    "the grbs with spectroscopically confirmed sne are generally underluminous and subenergetic in comparison to a typical long grb , though grb030329 is a notable exception to this .",
    "the prompt emission of these bursts has a lower energy spectral peak than a typical grb @xcite and they are suggested to have less relativistic outflows , or be viewed more off - axis .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed nearby ( @xmath5 ) , underluminous / subenergetic grbs , including grb100316d , may be drawn from a different population to the cosmological grb sample , motivated by estimates of the local grb rate several times greater than the rate of cosmological grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radio observations of grbs suggest that mildly relativistic ejecta and often high luminosities are the properties that distinguish the supernovae associated with grbs from the non - relativistic ordinary type ib / c supernovae @xcite .",
    "grb060218 was a landmark long - duration , low - luminosity , soft spectral peak event , detected by the _ swift _",
    "satellite @xcite with unprecedented multiwavelength coverage of the prompt emission .",
    "the prompt spectrum was found to comprise both the non - thermal synchrotron emission ascribed to most grbs and thought to originate in the collision of fast - moving shells within the grb jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a thermal component .",
    "the presence of this thermal component , together with its evolution , led to the suggestion that we were observing the shock breakout of the supernova for the first time @xcite .",
    "however , the non - thermal emission did not differ greatly from that of the x - ray flash class of soft grbs and an outflow speed close to the speed of light could be inferred @xcite , alternatively suggesting this to be an extension of the typical grb population and not requiring significantly slower ejecta or any special ( off - axis ) geometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculate that the long - duration , low - luminosity events such as this one may point to a different central engine for these events compared with more typical grbs : a neutron star rather than a black hole ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    also of relevance to this discussion",
    "are the supernovae for which no grb was detected , yet for which mildly relativistic ejecta provide a good explanation for the radio data : sn2007gr @xcite and sn2009bb @xcite . as grb jets",
    "are thought to be highly collimated , it is expected that many will go undetected if the emission is directed away from our line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a fraction will also lie below current detector sensitivity limits . @xcite",
    "estimate the fraction of type ib / c sne with central engines at about one per cent , consistent with the inferred rate of nearby grbs .",
    "in contrast , there are nearby grbs for which an accompanying supernova could be expected but none has been detected to extremely deep limits .",
    "grbs 060505 and 060614 @xcite are the two best examples of this , highlighting the need for a greater understanding of the relationship between grbs and sne .",
    "we present the discovery of a new grb - sn , grb100316d @xcite associated with sn2010bh @xcite .",
    "this is an unusually long - duration , soft - spectrum grb positioned on a nearby host galaxy .",
    "many of the properties of this grb appear unlike those of typical grbs , resembling rather grb060218 . in this paper",
    "we report accurate astrometry for the grb - sn and the redshift of the underlying host galaxy .",
    "we examine the grb prompt and afterglow emission observed with all 3 instruments on - board _ swift _ , and the broad characteristics of the host galaxy as observed with the gemini south telescope , the very large telescope ( vlt ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "we compare these properties with the grb sample as a whole and with a subset of grb - sne , to understand the origins of the grb emission and further our knowledge of the grb ",
    "sn connection .",
    "on 2010 march 16 at 12:44:50 ut ( hereafter t@xmath6 ) , the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat , @xcite ) triggered on and slewed immediately to grb100316d @xcite .",
    "this was an image trigger , since no rapid , substantial rise in the count rate occurred , but a possible low - level peak about 100  s long was noted in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt , @xcite ) on - board _ swift _ began observing the field at 12:47:08.1 ut , 137.7  s after the bat trigger , beginning with 10  s of windowed timing ( wt ) mode settling data and followed by 593  s of wt pointing data .",
    "after a time gap due to observing constraints , data - taking recommenced at t@xmath6 + 33  ks with xrt in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "the best x - ray position for this source is the astrometrically corrected xrt position of ra , dec ( j2000 ) = 07h 10 m 30.63s , -56d 15 19.7@xmath7 , with an uncertainty of 3.7@xmath7 ( radius , at 90% confidence * ? ? ?",
    "_ swift s _ ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot , @xcite ) began observing with the white filter 148  s after the bat trigger and continued observations in u band , thereafter cycling repeatedly through all its lenticular filters .",
    "the _ swift _ data were processed and analysed with the _ swift _ tools version 3.5 , released as part of heasoft 6.8 , and the latest calibration data at 2010 march were used .",
    "xrt wt spectra were grouped with a minimum of 20 counts in each bin , allowing the use of @xmath8 statistics , while for the pc spectrum 1 count per bin was required and cash statistics used .",
    "we fit the x - ray spectra over the energy range 0.310 kev and the @xmath1-ray spectra over the range 1550 kev ( as this is a soft event very few counts are present above 50 kev ) using the spectral fitting package xspec @xcite .",
    "we used the x - ray absorption models phabs and zphabs for which photoionization cross - sections are taken from @xcite and solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "the galactic absorption in the x - ray band is fixed at 7@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 throughout @xcite .",
    "we tested for any differences in the spectral fitting results from use of different grade selections or different energy ranges ( excluding 0.30.5 kev and/or including 50150 kev ) and confirm that these have no effect .",
    "optical / uv photometry was performed with the uvot tool uvotsource . at the position of the sn reported by @xcite",
    ", background subtracted count rates were extracted using a circular source aperture of 2.5@xmath7 .",
    "source - free background was taken from a region situated outside of the host galaxy .",
    "the count rate was aperture corrected to 5@xmath7 in order to be compatible with the uvot calibration @xcite .",
    "with uvot we detect the host galaxy , but no new point sources .",
    "the 3@xmath12 upper limit on any optical transient emission was taken to be the background subtracted count rate plus three times the count rate error and was converted into magnitude using the zero points provided in @xcite . at this time , galaxy subtraction can not be performed since there are no uvot pre- or post - explosion observations .",
    "the host galaxy count rate was determined using an elliptical source region , which enclosed the whole galaxy , and a source - free background region .",
    "photometry of the host was performed on a sum of all data from @xmath13  s after the trigger onwards for each filter .",
    "since the ellipse is similar in area to a 5@xmath7 circular aperture ( semi - major and -minor axes of 7.5@xmath7 and 5.5@xmath7 respectively ) , we have taken the standard uvot co - incidence loss correction to be the best estimate of the co - incidence loss , and the standard uvot zero points have been used to convert the count rate into magnitudes .      our first optical observations of grb100316d were obtained with gemini - south , starting on march 16 23:53 ut . in these images we identified two point sources ,",
    "consistent with the initial xrt position @xcite .",
    "we acquired spectroscopy of these with the 3-arm echelle spectrograph x - shooter @xcite , mounted on unit telescope 2 of the vlt .",
    "these sources were later shown to be compact hii regions unrelated to the supernova . in this paper",
    "we will make use of the spectra obtained of the brightest of these two regions , referred to as source ` a ' in @xcite ( see figure [ subtraction ] ) .",
    "we obtained two spectra each of 1200  s exposure of source a , using a 5@xmath7 nod throw along the slit to achieve better sky subtraction .",
    "we used slit widths of 1.0 , 1.0 and 0.9@xmath7 for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively .",
    "data were reduced using version 0.9.4 of the eso x - shooter pipeline @xcite .",
    "calibration data ( bias , dark , arc lamp , flatfield and flexure control frames ) were taken the same night .",
    "extracted spectra were flux calibrated using spectrophotometric standard star exposures , also taken the same night , resulting in flux calibrated spectra spanning the ultraviolet to the near - infrared ( @xmath14 nm ) simultaneously .",
    "we obtained further imaging of the localization with gemini - south on the subsequent three nights , using these we were able to identify a further bright point source superimposed on the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "image subtraction performed between the different images showed a clear brightening in this source , which we subsequently identified as the associated rising supernova ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ subtraction ] ) .",
    "we obtained deep imaging of the position of grb100316d using the fors2 instrument on unit telescope 1 of the vlt .",
    "seeing conditions during both epochs were good , averaging 0.8@xmath7 , but the second epoch observations suffer from fairly bright background caused by high airmass and a bright moon .",
    "the grb - sn is clearly visible in both epochs .",
    "following the announcement of a sn discovery @xcite , we triggered our cycle  17 hst programme .",
    "here we report the first epoch , obtained on march 25 , @xmath159 days after the bat trigger .",
    "the details of the ground - based and hst observations can be found in table [ table : opticallog ] .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in iraf .    [ cols=\">,<,^,^ \" , ]      in section [ sec : cfgrbsne ] we found that among the grb - sne , there is a clear commonality in the x - ray behaviour of 100316d and 060218 . comparing the prompt emission spectra in section [ sec : spec ] , we again find parallels in that both bursts seem to require a similar thermal component in addition to the typical grb synchrotron emission for which the synchrotron peak is observed to move to lower energies with time .",
    "the time - evolving prompt spectral parameters are compared in figure [ epkevolcf060218 ] .",
    "both events have low isotropic equivalent energies , of order 4@xmath910@xmath16 erg , and very little flux above 50 kev .",
    "these two events lie in apparently quite different environments : 060218 in a faint , compact dwarf @xcite and 100316d in a luminous , disturbed possibly spiral host galaxy .",
    "the metallicities are also different , with the host of 100316d likely being more metal - rich ( though the metallicity is below solar ) . a prompt optical component , as observed in 060218 ,",
    "could not be detected in 100316d , but conditions for its detection were far less optimal in this case due to the superposition on a brighter host galaxy and the possibility of a higher extinction along the line - of - sight .",
    "the higher intrinsic x - ray column density we measure for 100316d compared with similar modelling of 060218 does not necessarily imply a higher optical extinction @xcite .    in summary , both 100316d and its predecessor 060218",
    "are nearby ( @xmath17 ) , long - duration ( @xmath181300  s ,  2100  s ) , initially relatively constant in x - ray flux ( figure [ xrtlcs_long ] ) , spectrally soft ( very few or no counts above 100 kev ; low @xmath19 , figure [ epkevolcf060218 ] ) , subenergetic ( both have @xmath20 erg ) grbs with an associated sn .",
    "these two events show similar prompt emission properties and stand out among the grb - sne subsample considered here for their unusual x - ray evolution . however , their host galaxies are rather different in morphology and metallicity , with the host of 100316d more closely resembling the host of 980425 .",
    "the thermal x - ray component , with a luminosity , temperature and radius similar to that observed in 060218 , dictates that the shock break - out of the supernova must be considered .",
    "the optical / uv thermal component observed in 060218 is not seen here : if the extinction is similar we would expect a shock breakout similar to 060218 to be two or more times fainter in 100316d and with the relatively brighter host galaxy it is perhaps no surprise that early optical emission is not detected with uvot .",
    "the presence of a thermal component in the prompt @xmath1-ray emission of batse ( burst and transient source experiment ) grbs , in addition to non - thermal emission , was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the discovery of thermal components in the _ swift _ xrt x - ray spectra shown here for 100316d and in @xcite for 060218 will therefore be important to consider in future studies of grb prompt emission .",
    "the dominant component of the high energy emission in 100316d remains the synchrotron - like non - thermal spectrum common to all types of grb ( with and without sne ) thought to originate in internal shocks in a relativistic jet .",
    "the long duration of the early x - ray emission is curious , and exceedingly rare , perhaps suggesting a greater reservoir of material is available to feed the central engine and prolong its activity .",
    "the discovery of grb100316d and its associated supernova sn2010bh and the analyses of its high energy emission and host galaxy properties presented here illustrates the diversity in grb - sne characteristics that must be understood if we are to fully appreciate the relationship between grbs and core - collapse sne .",

    "<S> we report the _ swift _ discovery of the nearby long , soft gamma - ray burst grb100316d , and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy and associated supernova . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the redshift of the event to be @xmath0 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb - sn . </S>",
    "<S> we study the extremely unusual prompt emission with time - resolved @xmath1-ray to x - ray spectroscopy , and find that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition to a synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray light curve has a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800  s. the host is a bright , blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south , vlt and hst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties . </S>",
    "<S> we compare and contrast the x - ray emission and host galaxy of grb100316d to a subsample of grb - sne . </S>",
    "<S> grb100316d is unlike the majority of grb - sne in its x - ray evolution , but resembles rather grb060218 , and we find that these two events have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the host galaxies of grb - sne demonstrates , however , that there is a great diversity in the environments in which grb - sne can be found . </S>",
    "<S> grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample of spectroscopically confirmed grb - sne , from which a better understanding of long grb progenitors and the grb  </S>",
