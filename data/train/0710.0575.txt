    "until recently the only measurement of open b - quark production in two - photon collisions had been published by the l3 collaboration  @xcite . in this paper",
    "the cross section was measured to be about three times the prediction of nlo qcd .",
    "similar results have been reported by delphi  @xcite and opal  @xcite at conferences .",
    "all these results have in common that the cross section is obtained from a fit to the transverse momentum spectrum of leptons with respect to jets .",

    "the standard method of identifying b - decays by tagging the displaced secondary vertex due to the longer lifetime of b - hadrons had not been used in two - photon processes at lep , as the lower average momentum and hence smaller displacement of the secondary vertex made such techniques difficult to apply .",
    "aleph  @xcite as now published a measurement from 698 pb@xmath1 ( @xmath2 gev ) using for the first time lifetime information to tag b - quarks in two - photon interaction at lep .",
    "the tagging algorithm relies on the impact parameter ( the distance of closest approach to the main vertex ) of tracks to identify decay products from long lived particles .",
    "a fit to the distribution of the ratio of the impact parameters and their estimated measurement uncertainties is used to derive the probability that the track originated at the main vertex .",
    "these probabilities are then combined to probabilities that the whole event , the first jet , and the second jet contain no decay products from long lived particles , and used as selection criteria in the event selection .",
    "the jets are ordered such that the mass of the first jet is closest to the b quark mass of 5 gev / c@xmath3 , the mass of the second jet is the second closest , etc .",
    "the selection is performed using iterative discriminant analysis .",
    "a total of three iterations is used , with the new discriminant function generated for the remaining events after the cut on the previous function has been applied .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ( left ) shows the discriminant function of the last iteration before the final selection cut is applied at @xmath4 .",
    "the right - hand side of figure  [ fig1 ] demonstrates the stability of the resulting cross section under variation of the final selection cut .",
    "similar studies have been carried out with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the final result is @xmath7 pb , which is consistent with the prediction of nlo qcd , but significantly lower than the result obtained by l3 : @xmath8 pb .",
    "another area where drastic disagreement between nlo qcd predictions and measurement in two - photon processes has been observed is the region of high transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) in single jet and particle production .",
    "the l3 collaboration has observed this excess consistently for both charged and neutral pions  @xcite and inclusive jet production  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that earlier measurements of these quantities will smaller data sets and hence smaller @xmath9 values found agreement with nlo qcd  @xcite , as did a measurement of di - jet cross sections using the full high energy data of lep2  @xcite .",
    "two new measurements have recently been published that are relevant in this area .",
    "opal  @xcite has measured the production of charged hadrons in 612.8 pb@xmath1 ( @xmath10 gev ) , in four ranges of hadronic invariant mass , @xmath11 , of the event .",
    "the results are compared to an nlo qcd calculation that has been repeated for the kinematic conditions of the measurement  @xcite .",
    "the calculation is found to lie significantly below the data for @xmath9 greater than about 10 gev , which can be reached only in the highest range of 50 gev @xmath12 125 gev . to facilitate a comparison with the l3 measurement of charged pions  @xcite",
    ", opal has repeated the measurement for @xmath13 30 gev and @xmath13 50 gev and scaled the result for the smaller acceptance in pseudo - rapidity of @xmath141.0 for l3 ( compared to @xmath141.5 in opal ) and for the fraction of charged pions of all charged hadrons using mc simulations .",
    "the results are shown on the left of figure  [ partjets ] .",
    "it is evident that the distributions measured by opal fall more rapidly towards high @xmath9 than those measured by l3 . in consequence",
    "there is a disagreement between the two experiments in this region and a better description of the opal data by nlo qcd than is the case for the l3 data .",
    "the only opal data point significantly higher than the calculation is that at highest @xmath9",

    "proceeds from the calculation of the partonic process via fragmentation functions  @xcite determined from fits to other data sets to obtain the observable quantities to be compared to data .",
    "jet observables are designed to minimize the difference between partonic and hadronic ( i.e. observable ) quantities .",
    "differences are nevertheless expected and are studied using the string hadronisation model as implemented in pythia  @xcite .",
    "opal  @xcite has recently published a measurement of inclusive jet production using 593 pb@xmath1 ( @xmath15 gev ) for kinematic conditions very similar to those in the corresponding l3 publication  @xcite .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the @xmath16 jet algorithm  @xcite .",
    "opal has in this measurement for the first time employed a likelihood event selection in two - photon processes at lep , to maximize the reach towards high transverse momenta , where the discrepancies between data and nlo qcd have been observed , and where background from hadronically decaying @xmath17 bosons becomes increasingly important .",
    "nevertheless opal finds that the measurement can not be extended beyond 40 gev in jet transverse momentum , where the background becomes dominant .",
    "this is to be compared to the range of up to 50 gev in jet transverse momentum published by l3 , who find much lower values of background up to the highest momenta studied .",
    "in contrast to the l3 results opal finds good agreement between the data and nlo qcd  @xcite up to the highest jet transverse momenta studied . to enable a direct comparison with the l3 results opal has determined the inclusive jet cross section originally measured for @xmath18 1.5 also in the range @xmath18 1.0 used in the l3 paper .",
    "the comparison of the two experimental results and with nlo qcd is shown in figure  [ partjets ] ( right ) . while the data points of l3 and opal are largely compatible with each other , the l3 points lie below the opal points at low @xmath19 and above at high @xmath19 .",
    "the opal points are well described by the theoretical calculation , but there is a discrepancy between theory and the l3 results , as already observed in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the results published by l3 , the analysis presented by opal hence finds good agreement between data and theory , and concludes that nlo qcd is the correct theory to describe this process ."
