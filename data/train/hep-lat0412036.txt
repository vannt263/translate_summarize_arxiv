    "it is now a well - established fact that the pressure , @xmath5 , and the energy density , @xmath6 , deviate @xcite in the high temperature phase of qcd by about 25% from their ideal gas values at a temperature of about @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the transition temperature .",
    "early expectations that @xmath6 would count the number of degrees of freedom in the qcd plasma through the stefan - boltzmann law are belied by the fact that perturbation theory has had great difficulty in reproducing these lattice results @xcite .",
    "there have been many suggestions for the physics implied by the lattice data , the inclusion of various quasi - particles @xcite , the necessity of large resummations @xcite , and effective models @xcite , interestingly , there has been a suggestion that conformal field theory comes closer to the lattice result @xcite .",
    "this assumes more significance in view of the fact that a bound on the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density , @xmath8 , conjectured from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite lies close to that inferred from analysis of rhic data @xcite and its direct lattice measurement @xcite as well as the lattice results of a different transport coefficient @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the measurement of the equation of state ( eos ) to thermodynamic fluctuation measures . in the pure gluon gas",
    "there is only one fluctuation measure , the specific heat at constant volume , @xmath1 . related to this is a kinetic variable , the speed of sound , @xmath0 .",
    "we report measurements of both of these in the high temperature phase of the pure glue plasma , through a continuum extrapolation of results obtained with successively finer lattices .",
    "not only do these quantities provide further tests of all the models and expansions which try to explain the lattice data on the eos , they also have direct physical relevance to ongoing experiments at the rhic in brookhaven .",
    "the speed of sound governs the evolution of the fire - ball produced in the heavy - ion collision and hence plays a crucial role in the hydrodynamic study of the signatures of qgp .",
    "elliptic flow is one of the most important quantity that has been suggested for the signature of qgp formation in the heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that elliptic flow is sensitive to the value of @xmath0 .    in recent years , event - by - event fluctuation of quantities has been of immense interest as signatures of quark - hadron phase transition . in order to use fluctuations as a probe of the plasma phase",
    ", one has to identify observables whose fluctuations survive the freeze - out of the fireball .",
    "the evolution of these fluctuations is sensitive to the values of @xmath0 , as shown in @xcite for the case of net baryon number fluctuation . in @xcite",
    "it has been claimed that , within the regime of thermodynamics , the ratio of the event - by - event fluctuations of entropy and energy is given by r_e==1(1+^2)^2 , and hence provides an estimate of the speed of sound , if @xmath9 turns out to be measurable in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the specific heat is , of course , directly a measure of fluctuations .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that event - by - event temperature fluctuation in the heavy - ion collision experiments be used to measure @xmath1 .",
    "also it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath1 is directly related to the event - by - event transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) fluctuations .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath0 also directly test the relevance of conformal symmetry to finite temperature qcd .",
    "it is common knowledge that qcd generates a scale , @xmath11 , microscopically , and thus breaks conformal invariance .",
    "the strength of the breaking of this symmetry at any scale is parametrized by the @xmath12-function .",
    "a recent suggestion is that an effective theory which reproduces the results of thermal qcd at long - distance scales may somehow be close to a conformal theory .",
    "the result of @xcite for the entropy density , @xmath8 , in a yang - mills theory with four supersymmetry charges ( @xmath13 sym ) and large number of colours , @xmath14 , at strong coupling , is ss_0 = f(g^2 n_c ) , f(x)=34+(3)(2x^-3/2)+ s_0 = 23 ^2 n_c^2t^3 , [ sym]where @xmath15 is the yang - mills coupling . for the @xmath16 case at hand , the well - known result for the ideal gas , @xmath17 takes into account , through the factor @xmath18 , the relatively important difference between a @xmath19 and an @xmath20 theory .    of course",
    ", at finite temperature there is a scale , @xmath21 , which appears in , for example , @xmath6 as a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "however , the strength of the breaking of conformal symmetry must be measured as always , through the trace of the stress - tensor . after subtracting the ultraviolet divergent ( @xmath23 ) pieces ,",
    "this is given by the so - called interaction measure , @xmath24 .",
    "thus the ratio , @xmath25 , which we call the conformal measure , parametrizes the departure from conformal invariance at the long - distance scale . , but @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the gluon condensate at @xmath23 . ]",
    "we shall present data for this quantity in this paper .",
    "note that when @xmath28 one has @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , if the gas is ideal , then one obtains @xmath31 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the formalism and lead up to the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath32 on the lattice in section [ sc.cvcs ] .",
    "some details are given in the appendices . in section [ sc.results ]",
    "we give details of our simulations and our results .",
    "finally , in section [ sc.summary ] we present a discussion of the results .",
    "those who are interested only in the results may read the initial part of section [ sc.formalism ] and then jump to section [ sc.summary ] .",
    "for any theory on the lattice one may compute derivatives of the partition function , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the volume and @xmath21 the temperature . in particular the energy density , @xmath6 , and the pressure , @xmath5 , are given by the first derivatives of @xmath35 , = .|_v , p = t.|_t .",
    "the second derivatives are measures of fluctuations . for a relativistic gas , where particles may be created and destroyed ,",
    "there is only one second derivative in the absence of chemical potentials , the specific heat at constant volume = .|_v .",
    "[ specht ] a quantity such as the compressibility is not defined in the absence of a chemical potential , since a gas may adapt to a change in volume without change in pressure by simply creating or destroying particles . nevertheless , the speed of sound is a well defined quantity .",

    ".|_t = s = t , [ entropy ] in conjunction with the definition of the entropy density , @xmath8 , above .",
    "although this work deals exclusively with the pure gauge theory , this seems to be a good place to remark that in full qcd without quark chemical potentials all these relations go through .",
    "however , in the presence of a chemical potential , compressibility is a well defined concept , and the speed of sound may be affected by this new physics .",
    "we shall deal with this elsewhere .      in order to set up our notation , and for the sake of completeness ,",

    "if the lattice spacings , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) along spatial ( @xmath8 ) and temporal ( @xmath41 ) directions , are related by the anisotropy parameter @xmath42 , then the coupling may be written as @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "it is known @xcite that in the weak - coupling limit , , for @xmath79 , the dominant contribution to all plaquettes varies as @xmath67 .",

    "hence in this limit @xmath81 and can be neglected in comparison with @xmath82 which is @xmath83 . as shown in appendix [ sc.variance-terms ] , @xmath84 in this limit . as a result , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . note that in any conformal invariant theory in @xmath87 dimensions one has @xmath88 , , @xmath89 , and hence , by eq .",
    "( [ cvcs ] ) , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the formalism outlined in section [ sc.eos ] corresponds to the so - called `` differential '' method . on the other hand , about a decade back",
    "a new method called the `` integral '' method was employed @xcite to find the equation of state of qcd matter .",
    "this consists of using the expression for @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ pressure1 ] ) while eschewing the expression for @xmath82 in favour of a totally different method for determining @xmath93 .",
    "this proceeds from the observation that @xmath94 for a homogeneous system . since lattice computations do not determine the absolute normalization of @xmath95 , use of this formula requires fixing an additive constant . in @xcite",
    "this constant was fixed by setting @xmath96 in the low temperature phase of qcd , slightly below @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to a conceptual problem .",
    "since the pure gauge phase transition in qcd is of first order , the system is not homogeneous at @xmath7 and the method is not strictly applicable there .",
    "one makes an unknown systematic error in integrating through @xmath7 .",
    "this is in addition to a small systematic error due to setting @xmath96 just below @xmath7 and the numerical integration errors .",
    "however , a decade ago , these errors were deemed to be smaller than the scale errors in the `` differential '' method which could give rise even to negative pressure in computations with coarse lattice spacings , @xmath97 , which were the only ones possible then .",
    "the two methods must agree in the continuum limit .",
    "a reanalysis of the data of @xcite showed that the two methods agreed to within 5% ( , within statistical errors ) for @xmath98 @xcite already for @xmath99 , , for @xmath100 .",
    "in fact a criterion for the agreement is straightforward , and follows from the fact the expression for @xmath92 is common to the two methods .",
    "since the integral method does not need the karsch coefficients , it allows one to use a non - perturbatively determined @xmath12-function @xmath65 .",
    "on the other hand , the differential method requires , for internal consistency , that the karsch coefficients and @xmath65 be obtained at the same order , , at one - loop order in the present state of the art .",
    "thus , a comparison between the values of @xmath92 extracted for a given @xmath55 using the two techniques would reveal at what @xmath21 the two methods become identical .",
    "then , using asymptotic scaling , one could also give the minimum value of @xmath55 which would be required for the same level of agreement as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "such a comparison is shown in figure [ fg.d - int - diff ] and demonstrates that a bare coupling of @xmath101 already suffices .",
    "the use of the `` differential '' method does require small lattice spacings , but this is currently quite feasible with modern computers .",
    "the advantage is that the formalism of section [ sc.cvcs ] can be used to compute second derivatives of the free energy as operator expectation values .",
    "if the eos were to be evaluated by the `` integral '' method , then these quantities could only be evaluated by numerical differentiation @xcite , which is a less attractive solution .",
    ".the coupling ( @xmath12 ) , lattice sizes ( @xmath102 ) , statistics and symmetric lattice sizes ( @xmath103 ) are given for each temperature .",
    "statistics means number of sweeps used for measurement of plaquettes after discarding for thermalization . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the numerical values of all these above integrals and their derivatives with respected to @xmath52 , at @xmath45 , are tabulated in table [ tb.i - values ] . using these values",
