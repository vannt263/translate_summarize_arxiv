    "the enormous amount of spectrum at millimeter wave ( mmwave ) frequencies ( 30 - 300 ghz ) and the development in mmwave devices manufacturing technologies make the mmwave communication an attractive candidate for the 5 g cellular network @xcite",
    ". large - scale multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission is suggested for mmwave systems to compensate for the significant signal attenuation in the mmwave band .",
    "however , a fully digital transceiver structure incurs significant power consumption by the large amount of radio frequency ( rf ) chains .",
    "phase shifters- or switches - based hybrid structures that employ only a few rf chains have generated considerable interests recently @xcite , @xcite .",
    "employing large - scale mimo leads to a large channel matrix which needs to be estimated for designing precoders and detectors . using a conventional channel estimator such as the least squares ( ls ) estimator demands a large amount of training resources .",
    "fortunately , the mmwave channel matrix tends to be low - rank due to the poor scattering nature at mmwave frequencies @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this sparse nature can be exploited to reduce the training data requirement .",
    "compressive sensing ( cs)-estimators have recently been proposed for phase shifter- @xcite and switch - based @xcite mmwave systems , which can reduce the required training time .",
    "the cs - based estimators generally need first define and quantize a searching basis , and have good performance with the assumption that the antenna array in the system is ideal , i.e. , the predefined basis in the cs - based method is perfectly matched with the actual physical model of the channel .",
    "however , in practice , there often exist uncertainties regarding the array response , e.g. , due to gain and phase mismatch , mutual coupling and position errors @xcite-@xcite . with such array uncertainties , it is challenging to construct a proper basis upon which the channel is sparse .",
    "since the performance of a cs - based estimator is sensitive to the choice of the basis @xcite , @xcite , a mismatched basis can result in significant performance degradation .",
    "furthermore , the cs methods such as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite may suffer from heavy computational load when fine grids are applied to achieve good performance .    in this paper",
    ", we study the channel estimation problem for single user switch - based mmwave systems @xcite and show the sensitivity of the existing omp estimator @xcite to the phase mismatch of the array .",
    "we also propose a basis - free matrix completion ( mc)-based channel estimation scheme and show that the mmwave channel satisfies the incoherence properties that enable accurate recovery of the full channel matrix from only a subset of its entries that are sampled uniformly randomly @xcite .",
    "we then discuss a training scheme that involves only properly controlling the switches at the transmitter and the receiver , which is compatible with the targeted hybrid structure .",
    "this scheme guarantees a high probability that at least one sample from each column and each row of the channel matrix is obtained .",
    "the singular - value projection ( svp ) algorithm @xcite is applied to implementing the mc - based estimator and its complexity and parameter choice are analyzed .",
    "the simulation results show that the mc scheme , which does not need to specify a basis , has lower complexity than the existing cs - based scheme @xcite and is immune to the phase mismatch of the array .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the switch - based hybrid mmwave system and review a cs - based channel estimator in section ii . in section iii , we present the proposed mc - based channel estimator .",
    "we show the simulation results in section iv and conclude the paper in section v.",
    "we consider a single user downlink mmwave mimo system which is the same as in @xcite .",
    "the system employs the array - subarray hybrid structure ( a6 ) of @xcite at both the base station ( bs ) and mobile station ( ms ) : at the bs , each of the @xmath0 transmit antennas is equipped with a switch , and every @xmath1 neighbouring switches are grouped together and connected to one of the @xmath2 rf chains .",
    "the ms has the same structure , with @xmath3 antennas and @xmath4 rf chains .",
    "the diagram of this structure is shown in fig",

    "similarly , we can define @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 is the steering vector of the angle of arrival ( aoa ) @xmath15 . assuming ideal uniform linear arrays ( ula ) with distance @xmath16 between adjacent antennas and there are no amplitude , phase or antenna positioning errors , the steering vector is given by @xmath17^t,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the wavelength .",
    "the steering vector @xmath14 is defined similarly .",
    "the path gains are modeled as @xmath19^t,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the complex gain of the @xmath11-th path , which is assumed to be i.i.d . @xmath21 distributed .",
    "the omp can be applied to estimating the above @xmath22 @xcite-@xcite , especially for channels with a small number @xmath12 of paths . ignoring the quantization error , using the virtual channel representation @xmath22",
    "may be modeled as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two dictionary matrices , and @xmath26 is a sparse matrix that contains the path gains of the quantized directions .",
    "the two dictionary matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 are commonly constructed using steering vectors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "vectorizing ( [ cs model ] ) leads to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the basis matrix , @xmath31 denotes conjugate , @xmath32 represents kronecker product , and @xmath33 is an @xmath12-sparse vector .",
    "noisy observations of linear combinations of the entries of @xmath34 may be obtained by training , yielding @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the sensing matrix specified by the training scheme and @xmath37 is the noise .",
    "the omp method finds the non - zero entries of @xmath38 from @xmath39 , which corresponds to finding @xmath12 out of @xmath40 candidate direction pairs . in order to obtain the row orthogonality of the two dictionaries ,",
    "the physical angles of the steering vector should be generated according to the following equation @xcite    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the number of grid points , @xmath16 is the distance between two neighbouring elements , and @xmath18 is the wavelength . if @xmath43 , equation ( [ dicangle ] ) simplifies to @xmath44 under this condition , when the numbers of gird points @xmath45 , the two dictionary matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unitary . when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the two dictionary matrices are redundant .",
    "the computational complexity of the omp method is about @xmath48 flops per iteration . in general , the larger the numbers of grid points the better the performance , yet the heavier the computational burden .",
    "the above analysis of cs - based estimator is under the assumption that the channel has a sparse representation under the ideal steering vector basis .",

    "even the unknown phase mismatch can cause the basis mismatch issue @xcite on cs - based methods , the channel matrix @xmath22 itself remains to be low - rank whenever the number of paths @xmath12 is small . in section iii",
    ", we introduce a mc approach which is basis - free and is thus immune to the uncertainties of array response .",
    "the mc problem is to recover an unknown low - rank matrix @xmath52 from a subset of entries sampled through the operator @xmath53 defined by    @xmath54_{i , j}=        \\begin{cases }          [ { { \\mathbf x}}]_{i , j } ,     & \\quad ( i , j ) \\in",

    "we then introduce a training scheme that is compatible with the switch - based structure and discuss the estimation algorithm and its complexity .",
    "we assume large @xmath3 and @xmath0 , which is of interest for mmwave applications .",
    "we first check the incoherence property of the mmwave channel with ideal antenna arrays .",

    "similarly we can verify ( [ a12 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "based on the above analysis , the mmwave channel @xmath22 without phase mismatches obeys the strong incoherence property with parameter @xmath101 when @xmath22 is large and thus can be recovered from a subset of its entries according to the mc theory .",
    "when phase mismatches are present , it can be seen from ( [ errorsteering ] ) that compared to the ideal steering vector , the amplitude of each element in the real steering vector @xmath102 does not change .",
    "hence the analysis for the channel under ideal antenna array assumption can still stand with the channel that has phase mismatch .",
    "the above analysis assumes noiseless samples of @xmath22 and provides useful guidelines for high - snr applications .",
    "the sampling pattern has a crucial influence on the performance of mc . from @xcite",

    "suppose @xmath103 entries of the @xmath5 matrix @xmath22 need to be sampled .",
    "the uss scheme suggests to take @xmath104 distinct samples from the @xmath3 entries of each column . in our switch - based array - subarray structure ,",

    "are activated during the whole training process .",
    "each ms rf chain is switched randomly to a distinct antenna in the associated subarray and @xmath4 samples can be produced at each training stage .",
    "thus , in total @xmath106 training stages are used .",
    "we now describe the training process .",
    "we index the bs antennas from @xmath107 to @xmath0 and ms antennas from @xmath107 to @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath108 and initialize all its entries to zero .",

    "the sampling scheme also guarantees that for each ms subarray , @xmath122 out of the @xmath123 entries of each column of @xmath22 have been sampled once .",
    "the event of missing an entire row of @xmath22 corresponds to the case that for all the @xmath0 columns , the @xmath122 entries are taken from a common subset of the subarray with size @xmath124 .",
    "the probability of such an event is @xmath125 which is negligible when @xmath103 and @xmath0 are large enough .",
    "for example , when @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "after the training process , we apply singular value projection ( svp ) algorithm @xcite to reconstruct @xmath22 .",
    "the algorithm is to solve the following matrix sensing problem @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a linear map , @xmath132 is the observed signal and @xmath12 is the maximum rank of the matrix @xmath57 . the mc problem is a special case of the above matrix sensing problem , which replaces the sensing operator @xmath131 by the operator @xmath133 defined in ( [ operator ] ) . therefore the problem becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 characterizes the sampling pattern .",
    "a similar algorithm has been applied to mimo channel estimation in a different scenario in @xcite .",
    "the svp algorithm for solving the mc problem is shown in algorithm i. the major computational cost of the svp is in step 4 , which needs to compute the rank-@xmath12 approximation of a @xmath136 intermediate matrix @xmath137 .",
    "this can be done by computing the svd of @xmath137 . in order to reduce the high computational complexity due to svd , we can choose an alternative way to calculate the rank-@xmath12 approximation of @xmath137 by first computing the eigenvalue decomposition of the @xmath138 matrix @xmath139 , and then obtaining @xmath140 , where @xmath141 consists of columns in @xmath142 that correspond to the @xmath12 largest eigenvalues . this way the computational cost of the svp algorithm is about @xmath143 flops per iteration .

    "2 support our analysis and indicate that setting @xmath148 for the svp has faster convergence than setting @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , the results also suggest that setting @xmath149 for the svp when solving the mc problem has a risk of diverging .",
    "we first show the influence of @xmath144 on the convergence rate of the svp estimator .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath150 bs antennas and @xmath151 ms antennas , and there are @xmath152 rf chains at the ms and the bs , respectively .",
    "the number of paths , i.e. , the rank of the channel matrix , is @xmath153 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is 25db .",
    "the aoas and aods of @xmath22 are uniformly distributed in @xmath154 $ ] , and @xmath155 is set to 1 .",
    "we use the normalized mean squared error ( nmse ) defined as @xmath156 to evaluate the performance of svp . under this system setting and using our proposed sampling scheme , fig .",
    "2 ( a)-(c ) show the convergence behaviour for different @xmath144 with sampling density @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "2 that when @xmath158 , the svp converges for all the three cases , and faster convergence occurred when @xmath147 rather than @xmath146 . for sampling density @xmath159 , when @xmath160 the svp diverged , and for @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the svp diverges when @xmath149 .",
    "the simulation results show that setting the step size @xmath144 in between 1 and 2 results in convergence and achieves faster convergence rate than setting @xmath146 .",
    "based on the convergence analysis in @xcite , the tolerance @xmath163 of algorithm i can be set as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the instantaneous total noise power of the observed entries , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are constants . since @xmath165 is unknown , we use @xmath168 to approximate @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the average noise power .",
    "fig 3 ( a ) shows the stopping performance of using this tolerance @xmath163 for a system with @xmath171 , and @xmath172 . as shown in the histogram in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) , the convergence rate is different for different snrs . for @xmath173",
    "db , it takes @xmath174 iterations on average for the svp to stop respectively , which are consistent with the results in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) . the simulation results in fig .",
    "3 suggest the tolerance can stop the algorithm properly .",
    "we next show the estimation performance and the computational complexity comparison between the omp estimator discussed in section ii and the proposed svp estimator .",
    "suppose we have @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "for the omp , two dictionaries are adopted , one is unitary with @xmath177 grid points and the other is redundant with @xmath178 grid points . for the svp , we set the step size @xmath179 . for the unitary basis , the per - iteration complexity ratio between the omp estimator and the svp estimator is around @xmath180 , and for the redundant basis , the ratio increases to 26 .",
    "we aim to compare the estimation performance of the omp and svp while considering their computational complexity . as both the omp and svp algorithms",
    "are iterative , we set the number of iterations of the omp and the svp to be the same in order to compare their computational complexity . under different levels of snr , we set the number of the iterations differently , which is 2 for @xmath181 db , 3 for @xmath182 db , 4 for @xmath183 db , 5 for @xmath184 db and 6 for @xmath185 db .",
    "this setting is based on the observation in fig .",
    "hence the total computational complexity for the omp - unitary is 6.5 times that of the svp , and for the omp - redundant is 26 times that of the svp .",
    "the comparison result in fig .",
    "4(a ) shows that under this system setting , the svp estimator can achieve better performance than the omp estimator while has much lower computational complexity .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , there can be phase mismatch among array elements in the antenna array in practice .",
    "the omp estimator that depends on the basis is sensitive to this array non - ideality .",
    "by contrast , the svp estimator , which is independent of the basis , is immune to the phase mismatch .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "we assumed that the unknown phase error is uniformly distributed as @xmath186 $ ] and simulated 11 different levels of phase mismatch by setting @xmath187 .",
    "4(b ) suggests that the performance of the omp estimator degrades as the phase mismatch becomes larger but the svp estimator has stable performance under different levels of phase mismatch .",
    "in this paper , we show that matrix completion can be used for mmwave channel estimation .",
    "an estimation scheme that is compatible with the switch - based hardware structure is proposed .",
    "we show that the svp method can exhibit significantly lower complexity than the omp scheme and is immune to the phase mismatch of the array .",
    "we denote the exact solution of ( [ matrix completion ] ) to be @xmath188 .",
    "then for the noiseless case we have @xmath189 .",
    "hence the objective function @xmath190 in ( [ matrix completion ] )    can be written as @xmath191 we also define an operator @xmath192 so that @xmath193 note that there are @xmath58 entries sampled from @xmath57 in @xmath194 , where @xmath60 is the total number of entries of @xmath57 .",

    "we then have @xmath197 where @xmath198 is using the mankowski inequality , @xmath199 follows from @xmath200 and @xmath201 is according to the eckart - young - mirsky theorem .",

    "<S> this can result in the loss of sparse representation and hence the degraded performance of the cs estimator . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel matrix completion ( mc)-based low - complexity channel estimator . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme is compatible with switch - based hybrid structures , does not need to specify a basis , and can avoid the basis mismatch issue . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the existing cs - based estimator , the proposed basis - free scheme is immune to array response mismatch and exhibits a significantly lower complexity .    </S>",
