    "the antennae system ( ngc4038/4039 ) is the closest observable major merger .",
    "it serves as a prototype for interacting galaxies and tidally induced activity .",
    "current high precision observations over a large range of wavelengths give insight to the dynamical and morphological properties .",
    "if one wants to perform state - of - the - art high resolution self - consistent models , a reliable set of orbital and structural parameters is required .",
    "due to the high dimensional parameter space of this problem , one needs fast and reliable models as well as a sophisticated strategy to pick out the best one .",
    "therefore we use the program minga ( theis @xcite ) , where an improved restricted _",
    "n_-body code is coupled to a genetic algorithm .",
    "it was shown in theis & kohle ( @xcite ) , that it is possible to reproduce the large scale features of an observed system with this method .",
    "a similar approach was successfully used by wahde & donner ( @xcite ) and ruzicka ( @xcite ) . +",
    "the introduction of dynamical friction in our restricted _",
    "n_-body code allowed us to model close interactions and late stages of merging .",
    "up to a mass ratio of @xmath0 , the orbital decay and the basic tidal features of a satellite merging with an isothermal halo can be reliably reproduced ( petsch & theis @xcite ) . while a mass and distance dependent description for the coulomb logarithm together with an orientation correction of the frictional force was applicable for these minor mergers , it did not perfectly work for a major merging system .    in this previous work",
    "we have focused on the determination and parameterisation of the coulomb logarithm @xmath1 .",
    "we found the best description of the dynamical friction using a modified chandrasekhar approach ( eq.[petsch_eq_4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath2    @xmath3 \\label{petsch_eq_6}\\ ] ]    the acceleration @xmath4 of a massive particle @xmath5 ( `` satellite '' ) depends on the background mass - density @xmath6 , the mass of the perturber @xmath5 and its velocity @xmath7 . for more details on the function @xmath8 ,",
    "refer to binney & tremaine ( @xcite ) eq.(7 - 18 ) .",
    "@xmath9 is a scaling factor of order unity .",
    "as galaxies have density gradients , the force might point not exactly opposite to the velocity .",
    "therefore we introduced an orthogonal component which is adjustable via an angle @xmath10 .",
    "the coulomb logarithm @xmath1 is the relation between the maximum impact parameter @xmath11 and the impact parameter @xmath12 that leads to a @xmath13 degree deflection .",
    "we found its best parameterisation to be mass and distance dependent ",
    "cf.eq.([petsch_eq_6 ] ) , where @xmath14 is the mass of the host halo enclosed within the satellite s distance @xmath15 . + as our simulation uses static dark matter ( dm ) halos , the structural change due to the interaction ( e.g. mass - loss and memory effect in the perturbed region ) is not included . as a first test",
    "we decided to directly implement mass - loss to our restricted _ n-_body code . at the time of the pericenter we are instantaneously reducing the mass of both interacting galaxies by the same factor .",
    "certainly this is a very rude and heuristic approach , but it will already give a hint , if the shortcomings of the dynamical friction equation for equal mass merger can be reduced by including mass - loss . +",
    "another important fact is , that the internal structure of the involved systems has a large impact on the merging process .",
    "e.g.  the merging time is strongly correlated to the velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore we exchanged our static isothermal halo by a static nfw ( navarro @xcite ) halo .",
    "it is shown in fig.[petsch_fig_4a ] , that the internal structure of a halo has a strong impact on the merging time .",
    "if the velocity dispersion within an isothermal halo is reduced by a factor of @xmath16 , the merging time can drop by a factor of up to @xmath17 .",
    "if disk - like galaxies are used instead of pure isothermal halos , the merging time gets even smaller . in order to achieve reasonalbe merging times ,",
    "we have decided to use nfw halos for future restricted n - body models , in addition they are able to describe the halo properties of a disk galaxy better than isothermal spheres . in order to quantify both processes from a stellar - dynamical point of view , we performed simulations with nfw profiles and the direct ad - hoc implementation of mass - loss described above .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[petsch_fig_4b ] , for an appropriate strength of the frictional force , the radial decay can be modeled convincingly , though the implemented mass - loss model is very simple .",
    "at the moment we are improving the approach by measuring the mass - loss in self - consistent simulations and gauging the simplified approach .",
    "in order to model observed major merger systems , we have implemented dynamical friction and a heuristic approach for the mass - loss .",
    "we have found , that nfw halos are more suitable to serve as host halos for our restricted _",
    "n-_body models than isothermal halos ( merging time , description of disk galaxy halo ) .",
    "our results show , that implementation of mass - loss is necessary when modeling @xmath18 mergers in restricted _ n-_body models . at the moment",
    "we improve our implementation of mass - loss , which will be calibrated by measuring the mass - loss of self - consistent simulations .",
