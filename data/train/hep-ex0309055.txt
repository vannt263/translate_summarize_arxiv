    "the @xmath14 cross section at low energies is determined by the transitions of light vector mesons v ( @xmath15 ) into the final state : @xmath16 .",
    "the mesons with zero isospin have large branching ratios : @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the process can also proceed via mechanism suppressed by the g - parity : @xmath21 @xcite or @xmath16 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the study of the reaction allows to determine the vector mesons parameters and provide information on the @xmath23 rule violation in the @xmath24 decay and on the @xmath12-parity violation in the processes @xmath11 .",
    "the process @xmath25 in the energy region   @xmath1{s}$ ] below 2.2 gev was studied in several experiments during the last 30 years @xcite .",
    "recently the process @xmath26 was also studied by the spherical neutral detector ( snd)@xcite , the process dynamics was analyzed and the cross section was measured in the energy region @xmath1{s}$ ] from 420 to 1380 mev .",
    "this talk is a review of the snd results .",
    "the spherical neutral detector ( snd ) @xcite has operated since 1995 up to 2000 at vepp-2 m @xcite @xmath27 collider in the energy range from 0.36 to 1.38 gev . during six experimental years snd had collected data with integrated luminosity about 30 pb@xmath28 . during the experimental runs ,",
    "the first - level trigger @xcite selects events with energy deposition in the calorimeter more than 180 mev and with two or more charged particles . for analysis , events containing two charged and two or three neutral particles were selected .",
    "extra photons in @xmath26 events can appear because of the overlap with the beam background or nuclear interactions of the charged pions in the calorimeter .",
    "under these conditions the background sources are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 processes . to reject the collinear background , the cut on @xmath36 of the charged particles was imposed : @xmath37 . to suppress the @xmath38 events an energy deposition of the charged particles in the calorimeter",
    "was required to be small : @xmath39{s}$ ] .",
    "the cut on de / dx energy losses in the drift chamber rejected the @xmath34 events in the vicinity of the @xmath6 meson peak : @xmath40 .",
    "then a kinematic fit was performed under the following constraints : the charged particles are assumed to be pions , the system has zero total momentum , the total energy is @xmath1{s}$ ] , and the photons originate from the @xmath41 decays .",
    "the cut on the @xmath42 was applied : @xmath43 at @xmath44 mev , and @xmath45 at @xmath46 mev . in the energy region above 900 mev for additional suppression of the @xmath47 and @xmath35 background , the events with exactly two photons were selected .",

    "the @xmath48 cross section was measured in the snd experiment at the vepp-2 m collider in the energy region   @xmath1{s}$ ] below 1380 mev .",
    "the experimental data were analyzed in the framework of the generalized vector meson dominance model .",
    "it was found that the @xmath49 and @xmath9 intermediate states describe the process dynamics .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons parameters were obtained and parameters of the @xmath7 , @xmath8 resonances were estimated .",
    "experimental data can not be described by a sum of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 contributions .",
    "this can be interpreted as a manifestation of the @xmath11 decay .",
    "the snd study of the @xmath26 process was reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "now the vepp-2000 collider with the maximum center - of - mass energy 2 gev is under construction @xcite . the @xmath26 process study will be continued in future experiments with snd detector at vepp-2000 .",
