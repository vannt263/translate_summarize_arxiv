    "over the past decade , solutions to the hierarchy problem have been dominated by an appealing theoretical paradigm : partners to standard model particles are postulated to cancel the quadratic divergence that otherwise affects the higgs boson squared mass .",
    "these partners can have spins that differ from those of their standard model counterparts , as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , or the same spins , as in little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "they can be associated with states in hilbert space of positive norm , as in the preceding two examples , or states of negative norm , as in the lee - wick standard model  @xcite .",
    "a point of commonality in all these scenarios is the requirement that the partner particles appear at or near the electroweak scale , which one might reasonably identify with the higgs field vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath0  gev .",
    "searches at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) for new particles around this energy scale have , aside from the higgs boson , produced null results  @xcite .",
    "of course , all the scenarios described in the preceding paragraph have a decoupling limit , and it is a matter of taste how much fine - tuning one is willing to tolerate before concluding that a given proposal is disfavored .",
    "one might hope that the planned energy upgrade at the lhc will provide more definitive results .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of even small indirect effects of partner particles in the current lhc data motivates the study of alternative paradigms . here ,",
    "we consider a scenario first discussed by bardeen  @xcite , and studied recently by many others  @xcite , that the standard model may possess a softly - broken classical scale - invariance that protects it from unwanted quadratic divergences .",
    "such a scenario can be realized if the standard model lagrangian has no dimensionful parameters and the higgs mass arises via dimensional transmutation .",
    "this can occur if the higgs field couples to a new strongly interacting sector , as explored in refs .  @xcite .",
    "( for a much earlier example of a classically scale - invariant theory in which the higgs boson mass is determined via dimensional transmutation in a strongly interacting sector , see ref .",
    "alternatively , the higgs boson mass can arise in a classically scale - invariant theory that is weakly coupled via the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the cw mechanism applied to the standard model alone leads to a higgs boson mass that is much smaller than the electroweak gauge boson masses , and hence is not viable .",
    "however , refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrate explicitly that modest extensions of the standard model can avoid this problem .",
    "it is this general approach that we pursue in the model building discussed in this paper .",
    "the argument of bardeen has been rephrased a number of times in refs .",
    "@xcite , with additional justification and emphasis varying from paper to paper ( see also a summary given in a talk by lykken  @xcite ) . rather than repeating this discussion , we refer the reader to these references ; here make only a few comments . in order for an extension of the standard model to be classically scale invariant and free of quadratic divergences ,",
    "one first assumes that the tree - level higgs mass term is absent and that there are no higher mass scales associated with new heavy particle thresholds , as would be the case , for example , in a grand unified theory .",
    "the latter requirement precludes a conventional see - saw mechanism for the generation of small neutrino masses , so we will simply assume that neutrinos have dirac mass terms with small yukawa couplings . as in the charged fermion sector , small neutrino masses are then technically natural  @xcite since chiral",
    "symmetries are restored in the limit of vanishing yukawa couplings .",
    "as flavor physics is not the focus of the present work , this assumption will suffice for the present purposes . if one then works with a regulator that does the least violence to the classical symmetry ( namely , dimensional regularization )",
    ", then one observes that a higgs mass squared generated radiatively in the infrared is only multiplicatively renormalized  @xcite ; this indicates that it too is technically natural .",
    "the only remaining assumption is that quantum gravitational physics does not spoil this outcome even though it is associated with a dimensionful scale , _ viz .",
    "_ , the planck scale @xmath1  gev ( or alternatively , the reduced planck scale , @xmath2  gev ) .",
    "our current uncertainty about the nature of quantum gravity makes this at most a plausible working assumption , but one that leads to a relatively restrictive framework for low - energy model building .",
    "such models can be more readily put to direct experimental tests .",
    "the model we study is one in which the standard model is extended by an additional su(2)@xmath3 gauge group and a complex scalar doublet @xmath4 that transforms only under this new gauge symmetry .",
    "the subscript represents the word  dark \" , since the new gauge sector only communicates with the standard model via a coupling between @xmath4 and the standard model higgs doublet field @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is typically small .",
    "this is the well - known higgs portal , one of the small number of possible renormalizable couplings between standard model fields and a new sector of particles that are singlets under the standard model gauge group . in the present case ,",
    "the dark sector is scale invariant at tree level and undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking via the coleman - weinberg mechanism .",
    "hence , the vev @xmath8 , which provides an origin for the higgs boson mass scale via eq .",
    "( [ eq : portal1 ] ) , is determined by dimensional transmutation .",
    "the su(2)@xmath3 gauge group is spontaneously broken , leading to a degenerate triplet of massive gauge bosons @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with masses @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the su(2)@xmath3 gauge coupling .",
    "these spin - one states are stable and are potential dark matter candidates .",
    "one of the results we present in this paper is that there are parameter choices consistent with viable coleman - weinberg symmetry breaking as well as the correct relic density of the su(2)@xmath3 gauge multiplet .",
    "the motivation for the work we present on this model can also be framed in the context of the existing related literature .",
    "let us give three different rationales that may appeal to readers with different theoretical tastes :    _ i_. ) the use of the higgs portal as a means for communicating coleman - weinberg symmetry breaking in a dark sector to the standard model has been discussed recently in the context of abelian dark gauge groups in refs .",
    "our work considers the phenomenology in a model based on a non - abelian dark gauge group , a natural alternative possibility .    _",
    "ii_. ) the possibility that dark matter may be spin - one is well known , and the case in which the dark matter is a massive su(2 ) gauge multiplet has been considered in refs .  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "called hidden vector dark matter , the doublet field @xmath4 together with the @xmath5 are assumed to have the most general scalar potential .",
    "our work studies the coleman - weinberg limit of the potential , leading to a model that is parametrically simpler and whose phenomenology is more constrained .    _",
    "iii_. ) there has been interest in dark matter models in which the dark matter candidate can annihilate predominantly into lighter , unstable intermediate particles .",
    "these  secluded dark matter \" scenarios  @xcite are less constrained by direct dark matter searches , since the annihilation cross section and the dark matter - nucleon elastic scattering cross section are determined by different combinations of couplings .",
    "our work studies a simple model that falls into this interesting category .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] , we define the model and our conventions . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : conc ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the gauge symmetry of the model is @xmath13su(2)@xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the standard model gauge group .",
    "the standard model particle content is assumed to include three right - handed neutrinos so that neutrino dirac masses are possible , for the reasons described in the introduction .",
    "in addition , the model includes a complex scalar doublet under su(2)@xmath3 .",
    "no fermions transforming under the dark gauge group are present , so the model is free of gauge anomalies .    at tree - level ,",
    "the scalar potential is given by @xmath15 where @xmath5 is the standard model higgs doublet field .",

    "the phenomenology of the model may now be specified in terms of a two - dimensional parameter space , the @xmath52 plane .",
    "we begin isolating interesting regions of this parameter space in the next section .",
    "given our assumption that there are no new , physical mass scales between the weak and planck scales , we first require that viable points in parameter space do not lead to landau poles below @xmath53 in any of the couplings .",
    "this precludes the possibility that a landau pole is a symptom of omitted new physics that is associated with an intermediate mass scale . of course",
    ", before a landau pole is reached , a given coupling will become nonperturbatively large , and one can not be sure that it actually blows up .",

    ", we evaluate the rge s between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , ignoring threshold corrections at the weak scale .",
    "we note that our requirement that the couplings remain bounded everywhere in this interval may be overly conservative , since ( as theories of tev - scale gravity have illustrated ) the cut off at which gravitational physics becomes relevant may in fact be substantially smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "we are also now equipped to determine the vacuum stability of the model at each point in parameter space . in the standard model ,",
    "one runs the higgs quartic coupling to higher renormalization scales and determines whether there are points where the coupling becomes negative .",
    "this result implies that the effective potential becomes unbounded from below . in two - higgs doublet models ,",
    "the standard approach is also to run the couplings of the tree - level potential , and to check that the tree - level stability conditions remain satisfied .",
    "the justification for this procedure is discussed in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . applying this approach to the present model",
    ", we require at large renormalization scales that eq .",
    "( [ eq : treevs ] ) remain satisfied . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not expect these conditions to be satisfied at small scales , since we know that at small @xmath74 the tree - level potential is _ not _ stable ; the one - loop corrections are necessary ingredients for obtaining vacuum stability in this region .",
    "given a choice of the two free parameters , the values and signs of all the remaining couplings are determined .",
    "hence , our scan over parameter space will include all possible values of the electroweak - scale couplings that are phenomenologically viable .",
    "we then require that eq .",

    "note that we do not extend these plots to smaller values of @xmath12 , since we will find that relatively large values of the couplings are required to obtain the desired dark vector annihilation cross section .",
    "this will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the remaining issue we wish to address in this section is higgs boson physics .",
    "the fact that the scalar mass eigenstates are mixtures of @xmath47 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 would otherwise correspond to the standard model higgs field , suggests that the model could lead to observable deviations of higgs properties away from their standard model expectations .",

    "current lhc bounds imply that this proportionality factor can be no smaller than @xmath79  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the mixing is large , then the otherwise  dark \" higgs @xmath43 would develop large enough couplings to the visible sector to be detected in higgs boson searches at the lhc . in this case",

    "hence , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsp ] the regions in which @xmath80 exceeds this value .",
    "the true constraint is actually weaker ( since the lhc bound is not as restrictive as @xmath82 for all scalar boson masses ) but the distinction is not important here since the difference this produces in the allowed parameter region of fig .",
    "[ fig : vsp ] is relatively small .",

    "if higher - dimension operators were present , this symmetry could be broken , leading to a decaying dark matter scenario ; this possibility is discussed in the second paper of ref .",
    "such dimensionful operators can not be introduced here due to the assumption of classical scale invariance .",
