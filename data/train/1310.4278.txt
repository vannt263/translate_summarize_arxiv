    "the most popular model for the generation of primordial density fluctuations is the inflationary scenarios @xcite .",
    "this model assumes primordial density perturbations of gaussian random phase and it has been shown that such initial conditions produce a sponge - like topology on large scales @xcite . at such scales , where the power spectrum has not been transformed by nonlinear growth , the topology of structure in the early universe is well preserved , and small deviations from random phase predictions give important information about primordial non - gaussianity , biased galaxy formation , and non - linear clustering @xcite .",
    "the genus statistic is central to these studies , and is now a well - tested quantitative measure @xcite , having been applied to both the sdss lrg sample @xcite , and the cmb @xcite .",
    "it s utility lies in the existence of the `` genus curve '' , an analytical expression for genus as a function of density , which allows comparison of observed topology with that expected from a standard big bang inflationary model @xcite .",
    "so far , fitting the gaussian random phase ( hereafter , grp ) genus curve to mock surveys in a @xmath5cdm cosmology has been remarkably successful .",
    "the genus has now been suggested as a cosmic standard ruler and a means for probing dark energy .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) feature , detectable in the power spectrum and galaxy two point correlation function , is the established `` standard ruler '' @xcite , with a reported fractional uncertainty in angular diameter distance to @xmath6 of 1.1 % expected for the sloan survey when completed .",
    "now , with the introduction of ever larger galaxy samples , such as the cmass data release 10 sample of the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , topology is becoming another attractive technique for probing the expansion of the universe and constraining the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "we apply the genus to 108 lrg mock surveys , derived from the horizon run 3 @xmath7-body simulations @xcite , in order to ascertain the statistical accuracy of said `` topological distance measure '' .",
    "@xcite presented the genus as a reliable description of topology .",
    "traditionally , the genus comes from the gauss - bonnet theorem , which states that the integral of gaussian curvature @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the principle radii ) over a compact two - dimensional surface is given by @xmath11 we use a slightly altered form of the gauss - bonnet genus , @xmath12 , so that it has a more intuitive meaning for cosmology @xmath13 see @xcite for relation to the euler characteristic and the betti numbers . with this definition ,",
    "the genus of a sphere is @xmath14 ; a toroid , @xmath15 ; three isolated spheres , @xmath16 ; a figure 8 pretzel , @xmath17 ( two holes , one isolated body ) . essentially , the genus is a measure of connectivity . a highly connected structure  such as a sponge",
    " will have many holes , a single body , and therefore a large , positive genus",
    ". a sparse array of objects  a meatball topology @xcite  will have many isolated regions , relatively few holes , and therefore a negative genus .",
    "an array of isolated voids will also produce a negative genus .    to calculate the genus",
    "we smooth the horizon run 3 physically self bound subhalo distribution @xcite with a gaussian smoothing ball of radius @xmath18 ( eq . [ smoothingball ] ) .",
    "we picked the most massive physically bound subhalos to match the number density of lrg galaxies projected for the sloan iii survey when completed .",
    "the horizon run 3 is a cold dark matter simulation .",
    "we make the simple assumption that the most luminous red galaxies will from in the centers of the most massive cold dark matter halos . in the simulation , the most massive subhalos ( @xmath19 30 cdm particles )",
    "are identified that physically bond and not tidally disruptable by larger structures  these we associate with lrg galaxies .",
    "we then create iso - density contour surfaces of the smoothed density distribution , labeling them by @xmath20 , which is related to the volume fraction @xmath21 on the high density side of the contour by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the density parameter .",
    "the value @xmath24 corresponds to the median volume fraction contour ( @xmath25 ) . for grp initial conditions",
    "the genus curve is @xmath26 where the amplitude @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the average value of the squared wave vector , @xmath29 in the smoothed power spectrum @xcite ; or , the slope of the two - point correlation function .",
    "the shape of a genus curve , and its deviation from the random phase prediction , can be parametrized by several variables .",
    "first , there is the @xmath3 best fit amplitude , which is measured by fitting the grp curve ( eq .",
    "[ genuscurve ] ) to the observed curve .",
    "this gives information about the power spectrum and phase correlation of the density fluctuation .",
    "secondly , there are three variables which characterize deviations from a grf @xcite :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the best - fit random phase curve ( eq . [ genuscurve ] ) .",
    "@xmath32 measures any shift in the central part of the genus curve .",
    "the grp curve has @xmath33 .",
    "a negative value of @xmath32 is called a meatball shift , caused by a greater prominence of isolated high - density structures , pushing the genus curve to the left . @xmath34 and @xmath35 measure the relative number of voids and clusters with respect to grp expectations .",
    "the horizon runs , provided by the korean institute of advanced study ( kias ) , provide some of the best raw material for calibrating topological study of lrg surveys @xcite .",
    "these @xmath7-body simulations replicate the topology of the sdss lrg s exquisitely @xcite .",
    "we use the horizon run 3 ( hr3 ) dataset exclusively , which adopts a pressureless cold dark matter cosmology with a pure cosmological constant @xmath36 .",
    "the basic hr3 cosmological parameters were fixed by the wmap5 data @xcite and the initial linear power spectrum was calculated with the camb source code @xcite .",
    "the entire simulation is a cube of 374 billion particles , spanning a volume of @xmath37 .",
    "initial redshift was @xmath38 and @xmath39 discrete timesteps were taken .",
    "the selection of cold dark matter halos uses the friend of friend algorithm , where separation cut off distance is 20 % of the mean separation distance . to improve cluster identification , hr3 searches for physically self bound ( psb ) subhalos that are gravitationally self - bound and not tidally disruptable @xcite .",
    "this provides a substantial increase in the similiarity between simulation and observational data , as these dark matter subhalos are sites for lrg formation .    to simulate the sdss survey dimensions , hr3 places 27 observers evenly within its cubical volume and allows each observer to see out to a redshift of @xmath40",
    "this crates 27 independent , non - overlapping spherical regions .",
    "the co - moving positions and velocities of all cdm particles are saved as they cross their past light cone and psb subhalos are identified from this data . in preparation for the sdss - iii lrg catalogue , it was assumed that a volume - limited sample would yield a constant number density of @xmath41 . in order to match this prediction ,",
    "the minimum mass limit of the psb subhalos was varied with redshift and the absolute minimums were set to @xmath42 . given these parameters , the physical properties of the hr3 mock surveys match very well with the most recent lrg surveys @xcite .",
    "we smooth the 27 past lightcone psb subhalo distributions with a gaussian smoothing ball @xmath43 smearing structure on scales smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "the mock survey data is placed into a three - dimensional pixel grid of density values , and we choose @xmath18 to always be greater than @xmath44 pixel sidelengths @xmath45 . for cold dark matter models , smoothing with a gaussian recovers the topology of the initial density field , provided that the smoothing length @xmath18 is sufficiently greater than the correlation length @xmath46 and non - linear effects are avoided is approximately @xmath47 for lrg ] .",
    "with this smoothed mock survey in hand , we convert from co - moving spherical coordinates to redshift coordinates , using a comoving line of sight distance formula @xcite .",
    "psb subhalo peculiar velocities are converted into redshift distortions by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the radial velocity , @xmath50 is the unit radial vector , and @xmath51 is the cartesian peculiar velocity of the subhalo .",
    "after redshift converting and correcting , we save psb subhalo counts within a grid of dimensions @xmath52 , with cubical pixel volume of @xmath53 .",
    "the entire grid spans a volume of @xmath54 .",
    "we then apply an angular mask , splitting the 27 perfectly spherical mock surveys into four quadrants each of @xmath0 steradians and radius @xmath6 , to approximate the area of sky coverage and depth in the sloan iii survey . with",
    "these @xmath55 smoothed mock surveys in hand , we calculate the genus using a polygonal approximation scheme developed by @xcite called `` contour 3d '' , which adds up angle deficits at pixel vertices .",
    "an application of quantitative topology being applied to the sdss lrg sample  other than testing the gaussianity of initial density fluctuations  is to measure cosmological parameters , such as those governing the expansion history of the universe .",
    "this can be done by measuring the genus statistic within a fixed volume at different redshifts . in the instance of @xmath7-body simulations",
    ", one knows the correct cosmological model and therefore the correct transformation @xmath56 .",
    "one smooths the density field with a known smoothing length @xmath18 and then measures the median density genus within a volume @xmath57 .",
    "this yields @xmath58 , genus per unit volume , which one can use to indirectly measure any physical volume by counting structures . in order to more explicitly state the smoothing length dependence , the dimensionless quantity @xmath59 is often used , which is simply the genus per cubic smoothing length .",
    "this quantity can be analytically calculated from a full set of cosmological parameters and a linear power spectrum .",
    "such a function @xmath60 has been examined closely for the wmap3 and wmap5 parameters ( see fig . 1 of and fig . 1 of @xcite , drawn by y.r . kim.)(see",
    "[ glambda3 ] ) .    in practice",
    ", we do not know the true cosmological model .",
    "let us illustrate the effects of applying an incorrect cosmological model to a survey sample .",
    "if we underestimate the expansion rate of the universe @xmath61 , then our conversion from redshift to comoving space will put celestial objects too far from the earth .",
    "this causes an overestimation of survey volume . for a homogeneous and isotropic survey ,",
    "genus is linearly proportional to volume and therefore an overestimation of @xmath57 will drive the genus at a certain smoothing length up ( @xmath62 ) . at the same time",
    "however , we have also adopted a co - moving smoothing length @xmath18 that is larger than intended .",
    "this will change the actual scale of study and erase all structure beneath scale by convolution , decreasing the genus ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "luckily , the net effect is detectable since the amplitude @xmath64 of the genus curve effectively measures the slope of the power spectrum at the scale @xmath18 , which is not scale invariant .",
    "our procedure for measuring angular diameter co - moving distance to @xmath6 is straightforward .",
    "we assume a @xmath5cdm flat cosmological model .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 come from cmb fits with @xmath68 which are insensitive to @xmath69 because dark energy has negligible influence at recombination .",
    "these values are used to construct the power spectrum and from that , @xmath70 ( see fig . [ glambda3 ] ) .",
    "now we measure @xmath71 and get a value ; we look on our analytical plot  fig .",
    "[ glambda3 ]  and find the true value of @xmath18 , which we will call @xmath72 .",
    "if this is 1% smaller than the initial value of @xmath18 that one used , it means that the co - moving distance out to @xmath6 is also 1% smaller than previously thought . in this way one can measure co - moving distance out to @xmath6 . and , with this as one data point one can fit a cosmological model , leaving @xmath69 as a parameter .",
    "if the intial cosmological model is slightly wrong ( _ i.e. _ @xmath69 may not be exactly @xmath73 , or may vary with time ; @xcite ) , this is inconsequential because we are just measuring the topology  counting the total number of structures inside @xmath6 .",
    "if the radial co - moving distance inside this volume is proportionately in error it will make no difference , as that will just distort shapes and structures slightly without altering their count ( see * ? ? ?",
    "an rms cosmic variance in the total genus @xmath74 out to @xmath6 in a survey sample will cause a fractional rms error of @xmath75 in @xmath71 ; and given the slope of the curve , @xmath76 at the applied @xmath18 , this will introduce an rms error in @xmath18 and therefore in co - moving distance at @xmath6 of :    @xmath77      we examine the statistical variance of genus per unit volume @xmath78 in the horizon run 3 mock surveys , which is far from an `` ideal '' measurement .",
    "an `` ideal '' measurement of @xmath78 would be examining the initial density field in comoving space .",
    "if the initial conditions were of grp , one would expect excellent agreement between the observed genus curve and the theoretical grp curve ; however , finite sample size , even at this level , introduces an error because of no power at large scales ( or , larger than the simulation box size ) .",
    "the next best measurement of @xmath78 would be examining the final conditions of the entire @xmath7-body simulation in comoving space , which erases a portion of the cosmic variance associated with small survey size , but is subject to the effects of non - linear gravitational infall and galaxy formation bias .",
    "an unavoidable source of error , `` ideal '' or otherwise , is finite pixel resolution , which applies a smoothing scale to the data and destroys structure smaller than pixel size @xmath45 .",
    "observation of @xmath78 in comoving space has obvious advantages to observation in redshift space , since one has complete knowledge of all psb subhalo positions and velocities .",
    "it has been found that the redshift correction for peculiar velocity presents the worst source of error for the @xmath3 best fit amplitude of the genus curve @xcite .",
    "the application of peculiar velocity redshift corrections is in essence a smoothing routine of its own , in that real - space structures are radially smeared due to `` fingers of god '' effects .",
    "this effectually raises the observed smoothing parameter @xmath18 slightly and yields a lower @xmath3 best fit genus amplitude .",
    "the choice of survey volume , specifically volume to surface area ratio , also creates error because of data being `` smoothed out '' of the survey region .",
    "the complicated boundaries of the sdss present a cause for concern ; particularly the three thin stripes along the southern galactic cap , which are ignored altogether during genus analysis .",
    "an sdss measurement of @xmath78 uses a finite , redshift space sample , where the aforementioned sources of error apply : the cosmic variance associated with small survey size ; non - linear clustering ; boundary effects ; and redshift space distortion .",
    "the situation sounds daunting , but because of its size , the horizon run 3 provides an ensemble of tests .",
    "we split the 27 hr3 spherical mock surveys into four quadrants , thereby acquiring 108 `` genus experiments '' for a chosen smoothing length @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite have reported the genus amplitude of the sdss lrg to within 5% accuracy . based upon our results ( see table [ statresults ] ) , we believe that this fractional uncertainty can be reduced to of 1% .",
    "we measured the genus per cubic smoothing length for @xmath79 , 21 , and 34 @xmath80 , studying the random and systematic error over 108 hr3 mock surveys . for @xmath81 , the fractional uncerainty in genus per cubic",
    "smoothing length was less than one percent , which translates to a fractional uncerainty in smoothing length  and angular diameter distance  of approximately @xmath82% ( table [ statresults ] ) .",
    "treating the variance at @xmath79 , 21 , and 34 @xmath83 as statistically independent  since hr3 adopts a random phase model and the smoothing volumes are significantly different  we add the three smoothing length rms errors in quadrature @xmath84 yielding a @xmath85% fractional uncertainty in smoothing length and angular diameter distance out to @xmath6 . combining only the @xmath86 and @xmath87mpc samples , we get a @xmath88% fractional uncertainty in smoothing length .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     with 108 samples in hand , our fractional `` uncertainty of the uncertainty '' is @xmath89 .",
    "it is notable that the systematic effect for the @xmath90mpc sample was very small , @xmath91% , and that the @xmath3 best - fit genus amplitudes modeled the @xmath59 curve extraordinarily well ( fig .",
    "[ glambda3withdata ] ) .",
    "with these results in hand , it is important to continue refining topological study of the sdss lrg sample with @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "extremely large cubes like hr3 allow for tight description of the cosmic variance in genus per unit volume @xmath78 and smoothing length @xmath18 .",
    "this statistical knowledge translates directly to the measurement of cosmological parameters such as @xmath92 .",
    "a possible extension of this work is to more accurately model the sdss survey with 108 less `` ideal '' masks .",
    "another possible extension is to measure the variance in genus per cubic smoothing length @xmath71 for a large number of @xmath18 s , perhaps iterating from @xmath93 to @xmath94 in small increments @xmath95 .",
    "smooth plots of @xmath96 and @xmath97 as a function of @xmath18 could yield useful information about the evolution of random and systematic error with scale .",
