    "the design of radios to be  cognitive \" has been identified by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) as the next big step in better radio resource utilization @xcite . the term  cognitive \" has many different connotations both in analysis and in practice , but with two underlying common themes : _ intelligence _ built into the radio architecture coupled with _ adaptivity_.",
    "cognitive radios have been studied under different model settings .",
    "the first models studied cognitive radios as a spectrum sensing problem @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . under this setting ,",
    "the cognitive radio opportunistically uses licensed spectrum when the licensed users are sensed to be absent in that band .",
    "problems encountered in this setup are threefold :    1 .",
    "sensing must be highly accurate to guarantee non interference with the licensed radio .",
    "control and coordination between the cognitive transmitter receiver pair is required to ensure the same spectrum is used , and finally 3 .",
    "there are no qos guarantees for the cognitive transmitter receiver pair .",
    "other models with different side information at the cognitive users have been studied . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors study frequency coding by the cognitive transmitter by assuming non causal knowledge of the frequency use of the primary transmitter .    in this paper",
    ", we study cognition from an information theoretic setting where we assume that the cognitive transmitter knows the message of the licensed transmitter apriori .",
    "such a model is interesting for two reasons : 1 ) it provides an upper limit , or equivalently a benchmark on the performance of systems where the cognitive radio gains a partial understanding of the licensed transmitter and 2 ) it allows us to understand the ultimate limits on the cognitive transmitter by giving it maximum information and allowing it to change its transmission and coding strategy based on all the information available at the licensed user . in essence , it enlarges the possible schemes that can be implemented at the cognitive radio , and 3 ) it lends itself to information theoretic analysis , being a setting where such tools can be applied to determine the performance limits of the system .",
    "many other configurations , including the interference channel setting when the cognitive transmitter does not know the message of the licensed transmitter are multi - decade long open problems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the fundamental limits of performance of cognitive radios . along the lines of @xcite",
    ", we consider the model depicted in figure @xmath0 . in this setting",
    ", we have an interference channel @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , but with degraded message sets , where the transmitter with a single message is called  legacy , \"  primary \" or ",
    "dumb \" and the transmitter with both messages termed the  cognitive \" transmitter .",
    "prior work on this model for the single antenna case is in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the performance of the cognitive radio model under a multiple antenna ( mimo ) setting .",
    "both the licensed and cognitive transmitter and receiver may have multiple antennas .",
    "mimo is fast becoming the most common feature of wireless systems due to its performance benefits .",
    "thus , it is important to study the capacity of cognitive radios under a mimo setting .",
    "there are some instances where the methods used in this paper bears similarities with the methods used for the siso setting .",
    "however , most of the proofs and techniques used here are distinct and considerably more involved than those used in @xcite . in the siso setting , it is possible to analyze the model for specific magnitudes of channels .",
    "this is not possible for the mimo setting .",
    "we list some of the crucial differences between the methods used in this paper and the methods that have been used under the siso setting .    1 .   in @xcite ,",
    "the authors obtain the outer bound using conditional entropy inequality .",
    "this method can not be extended to the mimo setting .",
    "we obtain the outer bound through a series of channel transformations .",
    "although the channel transformations are similar in spirit to those in @xcite , the actual transformations used are significantly different both in nature and in the mathematical proofs that accompany them . in @xcite , the authors reduce the channel to a broadcast channel where the combined transmitters have individual power constraints and the cognitive receiver has the message of the licensed user provided to it by a genie .",
    "the capacity region for such a variation of broadcast channel is not known in general .",
    "the authors solve for the capacity region of the broadcast channel using aligned channel techniques . on the other hand , we reduce the mimo cognitive channel to a broadcast channel with sum power constraint and whose capacity region is now known @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we then use optimization techniques to compare the achievable scheme with the outer bound .      in this paper ,",
    "our main contributions include :    \\1 .",
    "we find an achievable region for the gaussian mimo cognitive channel ( mcc ) in a fashion analogous to @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we find an outer bound on the capacity region of the mcc .",
    "we show that , under certain conditions ( that depend on the channel parameters ) , the outer bound is tight for a portion of the capacity region boundary , including points corresponding to the sum - capacity of the channel . combining the two above",
    ", we characterize the sum capacity of this channel and a portion of its entire capacity region under certain conditions .",
