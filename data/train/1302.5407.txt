    "the main reason of this expansion is said to be a mysterious energy with large negative pressure known as dark energy ( de ) .",
    "recent data @xcite-@xcite shows that de occupies @xmath1 of the universe and @xmath2 is occupied by some other matter .",
    "the cosmological constant is the best identification of this mysterious energy , but it raises some other issues like fine - tuning and cosmic - coincidence puzzle .",
    "the equation of state parameter ( eos ) , @xmath3 is the most acceptable candidate for de .",
    "some dynamical models also help to understand its nature like quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon field @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , phantom model @xcite-@xcite etc .",
    "recent literature indicate keen interest to check the validity of first and second law of thermodynamics . in different scenarios ,",

    "@xcite investigated that these laws are valid on the apparent horizon , when different from the event horizon , but do not hold for event horizon .",

    "mubasher et al .",
    "@xcite proved that gslt holds for all time and does not depend upon geometry and eos parameter .",
    "the validity of gslt has also been checked on kaluza - klein cosmology with modified hde ( mhde ) @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", the validity of gslt is investigated when anisotropic de is interacting with anisotropic radiations and dm in bi universe model .",
    "holographic de principle is also used to study the nature of de .",

    "@xcite explored that the de is proportional to the ricci scalar .",
    "some recent work @xcite-@xcite shows that the rde model fits well with observational data .",
    "@xcite defined two types of de models , i.e. , generalized hde ( ghde ) and generalized rde ( grde ) models    in this paper , we use lrs bi universe model composed of dm and de with ghde and grde models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section * 2 * , the density and pressure for ghde and grde models are found .",

    "we use the well - known condition @xmath14 @xcite-@xcite , where @xmath15 is a positive constant . consequently , the above metric reduces to @xmath16 the first field equation corresponding to this metric gives us @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the directional hubble parameter .",
    "the conservation equation yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid , respectively . taking derivative of eq.([4 ] ) and using eq.([5 ] )",
