    "the two tools used most frequently to characterise the orientation and magnetic geometry of a radio pulsar are its pulse profile and position angle ( pa ) swing .",
    "the rotating vector model @xcite , which assumes an axisymmetric magnetic field , predicts an s - shaped swing across one pulse period and is traditionally used to determine the inclinations of the magnetic axis of symmetry and the observer s line of sight to the rotation axis .",
    "however , limitations arise when analysing only the pa swing , especially as the magnetosphere is not axisymmetric in general , e.g. the magnetic field includes a current - modified component @xcite .    in @xcite ( hereafter cm10 ) , stokes tomography was introduced as a diagnostic tool to be used alongside more traditional methods of analysis .",
    "it exploits the fact that the phase portraits traced out by the four stokes parameters , when plotted against each other over one pulse period , are unique for any given magnetic geometry and orientation .",
    "an atlas of look - up tables , containing stokes phase portraits and pa swings , was generated by cm10 for a variety of simple models , including pure and current - modified dipole fields , filled core and hollow cone beams , and the associated linear polarization patterns .",
    "cm10 also showed that , from a sample of 24 nominally  dipolar \" pulsars , which obey the period - pulse - width relation and/or exhibit clean s - shaped pa swings , the stokes phase portraits of 16 objects are either inconsistent with low - altitude emission from a pure dipole field , or have a highly asymmetric surface emission pattern .    in this paper , we turn our attention to millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "polarimetric studies of msp radio emission have uncovered complex behaviour not normally seen in slower pulsars . in particular , the pa swings of many msps are neither clean nor s - shaped ; instead , they are flat @xcite , highly distorted ( e.g. psr j0437@xmath04715 ; * ? ? ? * ) or extremely noisy ( e.g. giant pulses from psr j1824@xmath02452a ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the pa swing varies dramatically with frequency for many msps @xcite , indicating that the magnetic geometry changes a lot with altitude , or that the observed pulse profile comprises emission from several different regions and altitudes .",
    "the above trends suggest that msps have nondipolar magnetic fields . in a non - recycled pulsar , a dipole field",
    "can be distorted by several mechanisms , e.g. a current flowing along the field lines @xcite , or rotational sweepback near the light cylinder @xcite . in a recycled pulsar with a history of prolonged accretion ,",
    "another set of mechanisms comes into play .",
    "for example , accreted material channeled onto the magnetic poles distorts the frozen - in magnetic field as it spreads towards the equator @xcite .",
    "quadrupolar magnetic fields , proposed to explain the x - ray light curves of her x-1 @xcite , can even be comparable to the dipolar component @xcite .",
    "multipole fields can also be generated near the inner edge of the partially diamagnetic accretion disk of an x - ray pulsar @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as the pulsar is spun up by accretion , the magnetic pole drifts towards the rotation axis , dragged inward by the motion of superfluid vortices in the pulsar s core @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply stokes tomography to millisecond pulsar data drawn from the european pulsar network s ( epn ) online database . in section [ sec : stokes ] , we briefly review the fitting recipe for determining the optimal orientation and beam polarization patterns from observed pulse profiles and stokes phase portraits .",
    "we also extend the model in cm10 to treat interpulse emission .",
    "we compare our improved look - up tables of stokes phase portraits and pa swings to observations of 15 msps in section [ sec : population ] to identify general trends .",
    "we then conduct detailed modelling of psr j1939 + 2134 , which has a strong interpulse , and psr j0437@xmath04715 , which has a pulse with multiple peaks , in sections [ sec : j1939 ] and [ sec : j0437 ] respectively .",
    "our findings are summarised in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , we begin by summarising briefly how to determine the emission point and hence the polarization state of the radiation as a function of pulse longitude , following the recipe laid out in section 2 of cm10 . our notation and definitions copy cm10 .",
    "we define two reference frames , as in figure 1 of cm10 : the inertial frame , in which the observer is at rest , with axes ( @xmath3 ) , and the body frame of the pulsar .",
    "the relative motion between the frames is computed by solving euler s equations of motion ( including precession in general but not in this paper ) .",
    "the line - of - sight vector @xmath4 is chosen to lie in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane , making an angle @xmath7 with @xmath6 .",
    "the rotation and magnetic axes lie along @xmath6 and one of the body frame axes ( @xmath8 ) respectively , separated by an angle @xmath9 .",
    "we define a spherical polar grid @xmath10 in the body frame covering the region @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 grid cells , where the line @xmath15 lies along @xmath8 , and @xmath16 is the light cylinder radius . in this paper , we take @xmath17 and @xmath18 to accomodate the relatively small magnetospheres ( and hence emission altitudes ) of msps .    radiation from highly relativistic particles flowing along magnetospheric field lines is narrowly beamed .",
    "hence , without relativistic aberration , the observed emission point @xmath19 at any time @xmath20 is located where the magnetic vector @xmath21 $ ] points along @xmath4 . when aberration is included , the emission point @xmath22 at time @xmath20 satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24/|\\mathbf{b[x}_0(t ) , t]|$ ] is the unit tangent vector to the magnetic field at @xmath19 , and @xmath25 is the angular velocity vector .",
    "cm10 considered emission from only one pole for simplicity [ i.e. @xmath26 in equation ( [ eqn : tangent ] ) ] , and hence ignored interpulse emission . in this paper , we include emission from both the north and south poles , requiring both @xmath27 terms to be retained in ( [ eqn : tangent ] ) . at every instant , we thus have four emission points which satisfy ( [ eqn : tangent ] ) , two in the hemisphere opposite the observer ( which he can not see ) , and two facing the observer , which we label @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we search the grid at a fixed altitude @xmath30 to find @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; the locations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 change with time in both the body frame and the inertial frame . the @xmath31 term in ( [ eqn : tangent ] ) encodes the aberration effect , as in @xcite .",
    "it is correct to order @xmath32 and should be replaced by the full relativistic expression when warranted by confidence in the model and data .",
    "the stokes parameters ( @xmath33 ) associated with the complex electric field vector @xmath34 at @xmath19 , which describe the polarization state , are defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the polarised fraction of the total intensity , @xmath37 is the linearly polarised component , and @xmath38 is the circularly polarised component . the observed electric field vector * e * , assumed to be in the direction of the particle acceleration at @xmath22 , because the emitting charges corotate . for more details , see the discussion around equation ( 2 ) in cm10 and equation ( a3 ) in @xcite . ] , is the incoherent sum of the electric field vectors at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , viz .",
    "@xmath39 , where the relative phase between @xmath40 and @xmath41 fluctuates randomly .",
    "the observed stokes parameters therefore reduce to @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this paper",
    ", we assume that all the emission is linearly polarised for simplicity , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "circular polarization will be examined in a companion paper .",
    "the @xmath45- and @xmath46- components are measured with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath47 which is fixed in the plane of the sky . in this paper , we choose @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the projection of @xmath25 onto the sky",
    ". then the polarization angle , @xmath51 , between @xmath52 and the linearly polarised part of @xmath34 is given by @xmath53    the observational data obtained from the epn are not necessarily expressed in the canonical basis @xmath47 .",
    "however , the @xmath54-@xmath55 phase portrait has the same shape in any cartesian basis ; if the basis is rotated by an angle @xmath56 with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the @xmath54-@xmath55 phase portrait rotates by an angle @xmath59 without being distorted , unlike the @xmath36-@xmath54 and @xmath36-@xmath55 phase portraits , which change shape .",
    "hence , when analysing the data , the first step is to reproduce the shape of the @xmath54-@xmath55 phase portrait as closely as possible without worrying about the orientation ; infer @xmath56 ; rotate the @xmath60 data into the canonical basis provisionally defined through @xmath56 ; and then adjust @xmath61 , and the beam and polarization patterns _ iteratively _ to reproduce the @xmath36-@xmath54 and @xmath36-@xmath55 portraits . the recipe for doing",
    "so is explained in section 2.6 and figure 3 of cm10 .",
    "figures [ m0w10lcostheta_tqvsi][m25w10lsintheta_tpa ] in the appendix display look - up tables of stokes phase portraits and pa swings , similar to those in cm10 , updated to include interpulse emission .",
    "the figures are organised into four groups , corresponding to two beam models ( filled core and hollow cone ) and two polarization models ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ; see cm10 ) .",
    "all the look - up tables are for a current - modified dipole magnetic field ( cm10 ) composed of a pure dipole plus a toroidal component with magnitude @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the poloidal field strength .",
    "an interpulse is a secondary pulse separated from the main pulse by approximately @xmath66 of rotational phase @xcite .",
    "it is believed to arise when a pulsar is a nearly orthogonal rotator viewed nearly side - on , shining from both magnetic poles , i.e. with @xmath67 , where ` @xmath68 ' means ` within roughly one beam width ' in this context @xcite .",

    "the size of the secondary loop ( i.e. the intensity of the interpulse ) increases relative to the main pulse as @xmath9 approaches @xmath7 , as expected . along @xmath79 and @xmath80 , when the interpulse and the main pulse peak at the same intensity , the primary and secondary patterns overlap in the @xmath36-@xmath54 , @xmath36-@xmath55 and @xmath54-@xmath55 planes , and the phase portraits are indistinguishable from the non - interpulse case .",
    "the shapes do not overlap exactly for other orientations , where the main pulse is brighter than the interpulse .    in the @xmath36-@xmath55 and @xmath54-@xmath55 planes , the balloons and heart shapes seen in cm10",
    "are also seen when an interpulse is present .",
    "for example , for @xmath81 , the stokes parameters trace out two reflection - symmetric patterns with positive and negative @xmath55 to form complex , interlocking shapes ( see figures [ m0w10lcostheta_tqvsi][m25w10lsintheta_tuvsq ] from the atlas of look - up tables in the appendix ) .",
    "as expected , the patterns are more intricate for a hollow cone than for a filled core .",
    "for example , the @xmath54-@xmath55 portrait at @xmath82 for a filled core contains an asymmetric , tilted heart shape and a small oval , both connected at @xmath83 ( figure [ m0w10lcostheta_tuvsq ] ) .",
    "the same orientation for a hollow cone shows a broader heart shape with two large , secondary ovals ( figure [ m25w10lcostheta_tuvsq ] ) .      in the observer s reference frame , charged particles flowing outwards ultra - relativistically along poloidal magnetic field lines",
    "also have a small transverse velocity component because they corotate with the star as part of the highly conducting magnetosphere .",

    "the electric field vector ( parallel to the particle s acceleration vector ) is also displaced , resulting in the well - known delay - radius relation @xcite .",
    "according to this relation , the centre of the pulse profile leads the steepest point of the pa swing by @xmath85 .",

    ", we do not include interpulse emission in figure [ compab ] , although , in general , interpulse and aberration effects are additive , as one can tell from the look - up tables in the appendix .",
    "the emission is placed arbitrarily at an altitude of @xmath93 to ensure a reasonably strong effect .",
    "we note that aberration introduces an altitude dependence in the case of a pure dipole , which is absent in the non - aberrated dipole considered in cm10 .",
