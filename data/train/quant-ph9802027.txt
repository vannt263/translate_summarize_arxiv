    "recent theoretical studies predicted the existence of non - dispersive wave packets in atoms driven by a microwave radiation of either circular @xcite or linear polarization @xcite .",
    "contrary to standard electronic wave packets which disperse in time when the binding force is nonlinear , these novel objects do not spread due to a nonlinear coupling between the atom and the driving field which locks the electronic motion onto the driving frequency .",
    "the phenomenon responsible for this locking is a 1:1 resonance between the internal ( kepler ) and external ( microwave ) frequencies , creating a resonance island at the center of which lies a stable periodic orbit . in the dressed atom picture @xcite , a single eigenstate of the full  dressed \" hamiltonian represents the wave packet @xcite , explaining immediately the absence of spreading .",
    "the very same microwave field is also responsible for the decay of the wave packet via ionization . as shown elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the typical ionization time of wave packets built from circular rydberg states around principal quantum number @xmath0 exceeds @xmath1 kepler periods being often longer than @xmath2 periods .",
    "the ionization occurs via a `` chaos assisted tunnelling '' mechanism @xcite ( the tunneling occurring from the stable island into the chaotic sea surrounding it ) . in effect",
    "the lifetime against ionization is very sensitive to small changes of the parameters ( microwave frequency , @xmath3 or its amplitude @xmath4 ) exhibiting large scale fluctuations @xcite .",
    "another possible decay mechanism of the wave packet is of course the spontaneous emission of photons . for circularly",
    "polarized microwave , the situation considered in this paper , it has been discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we readdress this issue since , in our opinion , the results reported in @xcite are incomplete . to this end , we use a different approach , borrowing heavily from the well known treatment of resonance fluorescence of two - level atoms driven by a laser field @xcite using the dressed atom approach . the main advantage of the present approach is its generality : it can be used for any polarization of the microwave field , for any superposition of driving fields with various frequencies and for any structure of electromagnetic modes surrounding the atom ( as shown e.g. in @xcite , the presence of a cavity can strongly affect the spontaneous emission of an atom ) .",
    "also , it uses the common knowledge widely developed in the quantum optics community and is thus accessible to a large audience .",
    "let us mention also that spontaneous emission of non - dispersive wave packets in linearly polarized microwave is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the basic properties of the non - dispersive wave packets ( not considering spontaneous emission ) from different points of view : laboratory frame or rotating frame , time - dependent or floquet pictures , dressed atom picture .",
    "the discussion is necessary for a proper understanding of spontaneous emission , which is done in section iii .",
    "our results are compared to the earlier published results in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the validity of the harmonic approximation , by comparing our analytical results to `` exact '' numerical calculations .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "we consider a hydrogen atom in the presence of a monochromatic driving microwave field of circular polarization , that is an electromagnetic field which can be described by a single mode . in this section",
    ", we will _ not _ consider any coupling to other ( initially empty ) modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this will be discussed in section iii .",
    "we first treat the microwave field classically .",
    "a full quantum treatment of the microwave field is possible ( see section [ dressed ] ) , but not really needed as , for usual microwave fields , the number of photons in the mode is enormous and a classical treatment of the microwave field is possible .      with the previous assumption , the quantum hamiltonian of the system is ( in atomic units , neglecting relativistic and qed effects , assuming an infinite mass of the nucleus and in the dipole approximation ) : @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the frequency of the microwave field circularly polarized in the @xmath6 plane and @xmath4 its amplitude .",
    "the @xmath7-axis is chosen to coincide with the microwave electric field at @xmath8      the hamiltonian ( [ hcl ] ) is periodic in time with period @xmath9 hence , a floquet approach @xcite may be used : any solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation can be expanded as a linear combination of _ time - periodic _ states - called floquet states of the system - with coefficients oscillating in time as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is called the quasi - energy of the floquet state ( there is no explicit @xmath12 in the equations as we are using atomic units where it is one ) .",
    "obviously , the quasi - energy is defined only modulo @xmath3 making the floquet spectrum periodic in energy with period precisely @xmath13 the floquet spectrum as well as the floquet states can be obtained from the diagonalization of a suitable operator , namely the floquet hamiltonian : @xmath14 with time - periodic boundary conditions . a suitable basis for the floquet hamiltonian is the product of any basis in usual space - for example , the usual hydrogenic eigenbasis with bound states @xmath15 - by the basis of time - periodic oscillating exponentials @xmath16 with @xmath17 an integer .",
    "we will denote @xmath18 such a basis .",
    "the next step is to expand the time - periodic hamiltonian in a fourier series and calculate the non - zero matrix elements of the floquet hamiltonian . because no higher harmonics of the microwave frequency exist in the hamiltonian",
    ", only matrix elements changing @xmath17 by zero or one unit do not vanish .",
    "moreover , in the specific case of circular polarization , the part in the hamiltonian which increases ( resp .",
    "decreases ) @xmath17 by one is proportional to @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) hence decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) the angular momentum of the electron along the @xmath21 axis by one unit . in other words ,",
    "the floquet hamiltonian obeys the selection rule @xmath22 this signifies merely that absorption of a @xmath23 polarized microwave photon must increase the atomic angular momentum @xmath24 by one unit .",
    "the floquet hamiltonian thus has a block diagonal structure and the hilbert space can be split into manifolds characterized by constant value of @xmath25 in each block , the floquet hamiltonian is no longer periodic in energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the floquet hamiltonian in blocks @xmath26 and @xmath27 only differ by a constant energy term @xmath28 which restores the total periodicity of the floquet spectrum . however , diagonalization in a given block is sufficient to obtain all the information on the system .      for a circularly polarized radiation ,",
    "another possibility exists which has been frequently used in the past @xcite . by passing to the non inertial frame rotating with frequency @xmath3 using the unitary transformation @xmath29 one",
    "may remove the oscillatory time dependence from eq .",
    "( [ hcl ] ) obtaining in the rotating frame the hamiltonian @xmath30    this time - independent hamiltonian has some energy levels and corresponding eigenstates .",
    "obviously , its spectrum is not @xmath3-periodic .",
    "however , the link with the floquet approach in the laboratory frame is easily established : there is a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenstates in the rotating frame and the floquet states in the laboratory frame from the block @xmath31 indeed , consider an eigenstate ( i.e. time - independent state ) @xmath32 of @xmath33 with energy @xmath34 from eq .",
    "( [ hrot ] ) , we deduce straightforwardly : @xmath35 which implies ( see eq .",
    "( [ hamfloq ] ) ) that @xmath36 is a floquet eigenstate with quasi - energy @xmath34 from the definition @xmath37 it is clear that the @xmath17-th fourier component of @xmath36 is nothing but the component of @xmath38 on the subspace with @xmath39 in other words , @xmath36 is a floquet eigenstate in the laboratory frame lying in the block @xmath40    of course , floquet states belonging to the other blocks @xmath41 can also be found from the time - independent hamiltonian in rotating frame .",
    "a first method is to use , instead of the operator @xmath42 , a slightly different unitary equivalent operator @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 an integer , it has the same time - periodicity as @xmath42 itself ) which leads to the following hamiltonian in the rotating frame : @xmath45 taking all possible positive and negative integer @xmath44 values one recovers the full floquet spectrum .    a second equivalent method is to keep the standard hamiltonian in rotating frame , eq .",
    "( [ hrot ] ) , and to consider states of the form @xmath46 . these are time - periodic floquet ( if @xmath44 is an integer ) , eigenstates of the floquet hamiltonian @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ hamfloq ] ) with energy @xmath48 , belonging to the block @xmath49    at a deeper level , this can be seen as a consequence of the unitary equivalence ( which implies the same spectrum ) for the floquet hamiltonians in the laboratory frame and in the rotating frame .",
    "the spectrum of the latter is here very simple : because @xmath33 is time - independent , it is simply the energy spectrum of @xmath33 shifted by an arbitrary integer multiple of @xmath13 for a more complicated case like  for example  a microwave with polarization close to circular , the hamiltonian in the rotating frame is weakly time - dependent and its corresponding floquet hamiltonian ( with the time dependent term treated perturbatively ) may be the simplest approach .",
    "an alternative view of this problem is to treat the microwave field quantum - mechanically as being in either a coherent state or a pure fock state with a large number of photons in the circularly polarized mode @xcite .",
    "this approach is quite common in quantum optics and is known as the dressed atom picture . then the atom is not considered as an isolated quantum system , but it is rather the strongly coupled atom+field system which is treated using quantum mechanics .",
    "the hamiltonian of the atom+field system is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the creation / annihilation operators in the occupied , @xmath23 circularly polarized mode , @xmath52 the corresponding components of the dipole moment operator and @xmath53 is the coupling strength , whose exact expression is given in section [ spont ] but not important at the present level .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath54 is time independent and may be expanded in the basis : @xmath55 denotes the number of microwave photons in the occupied mode .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian yields then the dressed states ; as its stands , the energy spectrum is not @xmath3-periodic .",
    "the absorption of a circularly polarized microwave photon increases by one the projection @xmath56 of the electron angular momentum on the @xmath21 axis . in the quantum field basis this manifests itself in the fact that the hamiltonian matrix is block diagonal .",
    "the hilbert space splits into manifolds characterized by the total atom+field projection of the angular momentum @xmath57 , i.e. , basis states coupled within a given block have fixed @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath57 is simply the total angular momentum projection on the @xmath21 axis carried by both the electron and the photons .",
    "when the number of photons is very large , @xmath59 we can neglect the variations in the non - diagonal matrix elements  proportional to either @xmath60 or @xmath61  across neighboring @xmath62 blocks .",
    "then , @xmath63 can be identified as the amplitude of the microwave field @xmath64 with this approximation , the energy spectrum is ( locally ) @xmath3-periodic . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath54 are obviously equal to the ones of the classical floquet hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ hamfloq ] ) ,",
    "already discussed in section [ floquet ] , provided that the quantum number @xmath17 labelling the fourier components in the floquet picture is identified with the number of photons @xmath65 this establishes  in the limit of a large number of photons  the one - to - one correspondence between the quasi - energy spectrum of the floquet hamiltonian and the energy spectrum of the dressed atom , and also the correspondence between the floquet eigenstates and the dressed atom eigenstates .",
    "the two points of view are completely equivalent : in the following , we will use the dressed atom picture as it seems more convenient for incorporating the spontaneous emission of photons .    as a final remark ,",
    "let us note that the previous discussion is already well known in a different context in quantum optics : for the simple case of a two level atom coupled resonantly by an oscillatory field , in the rotating wave approximation .",
    "there , a field - quantized or floquet approach yields an energy spectrum periodic in @xmath3  a sequence of doublets separated by the rabi frequency @xcite  while semiclassically in the  rotating frame \" @xcite one gets a single doublet of states .      as discussed in the three preceding sections , there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the eigenstates in the rotating frame , the floquet eigenstates and the dressed states in the quantum language .",
    "therefore , we shall call in the following the eigenenergies of either of the hamiltonians ( [ hamfloq]),([hrot ] ) or ( [ hq ] ) as quasienergies while referring to the eigenstates as floquet eigenstates or dressed states .",
    "as we are interested in the regime of highly excited rydberg states ( with typical principal quantum number 60 ) driven by a resonant microwave field , the number of atomic states significantly coupled by the microwave field is enormous . for computational efficiency",
    ", it is better to use a sturmian basis @xcite rather than the usual atomic basis .",
    "the advantage is that it provides a discretization of the atomic continuum .",
    "combined with the complex rotation technique , it allows us to find not only the energies of the dressed states but also their lifetimes against ionization by the microwave field @xcite .",
    "to numerically find several converged dressed states , diagonalizations of very large matrices ( of the order of @xmath1 ) are necessary .",
    "as discussed above , there exists a full equivalence between diagonalization of the floquet hamiltonian , i.e. clever use of the time - periodic structure of the problem and diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the rotating frame .",
    "the computational efficiencies of the two points of view are strictly equal .",
    "our computer code @xcite diagonalizes in fact @xmath66 contrary to the statement in @xcite .",
    "some time ago , klar @xcite noticed that the hamiltonian ( [ hrot ] ) in the rotating frame allows for the existence of a stable fixed ( equilibrium ) point in a certain range of microwave amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "the beautiful contribution of @xcite was to notice that wave packets initially localized in the vicinity of this fixed point will not disperse ( being bound by the fact that the fixed point is stable ) for very long time . in the laboratory frame , these wave packets also called  trojan states \" in @xcite appear as wave packets moving around the nucleus along the circular trajectory [ the periodic orbit of ( [ hcl ] ) ] .",
    "the existence of  stationary \" wave packets  keeping exactly their shape during propagation along the circular orbit and hence not dispersing at arbitrarily long times ( neglecting the very slow ionization )  was later found in @xcite . these are simply some among the eigenstates of the dressed atom : by construction , they are strictly periodic functions of time .",
    "semiclassically , the wave packets are manifestations of the motion inside the stable primary 1:1 resonance zone when the microwave frequency matches the electronic frequency .",
    "similar states have been studied earlier for model one - dimensional driven systems @xcite . while for other models , the wave packet resembles itself every period of the driving perturbation",
    "( while changing shape within one period @xcite ) , the wave packets in circular polarization keep the same shape at all times .",
    "this is due to the conservation of @xmath57 .",
    "quantum mechanically , any dressed eigenstate may be viewed as a linear combination of atomic states , combined with appropriate photonic states ( in such a way that in the combination @xmath57 is conserved ) .",
    "the wave packet states are linear combinations of atomic rydberg states coupled by resonant microwaves .",
    "thus , the biggest contribution to this combination comes from circular states with principal quantum number @xmath67 close to : @xmath68 note that @xmath69 is not necessarily an integer . for the particular case of the  ground state wave packet \" ( with maximum localization near the fixed point )",
    ", it is a superposition of mainly circular atomic states @xmath70 with a small contamination of other quasi - two - dimensional states of the form @xmath71 and even smaller contributions from states @xmath72 extending significantly out of the @xmath73 plane .    the fixed point in the rotating frame",
    "is located at @xmath74 and @xmath75 satisfying @xmath76 it is convenient to introduce @xcite a dimensionless parameter : @xmath77 then @xmath78 for @xmath79 and the fixed point is stable for @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "it is also useful to define scaled variables which make the discussion of the results less dependent on the particular microwave frequency value @xcite .",
    "we have already defined the effective principal quantum number @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ n0 ] ) .",
    "the scaled microwave amplitude is defined as @xmath81 @xmath82 is a dimensionless parameter simply related to @xmath83 , see eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , via @xmath84    a possible way for creation of a non - dispersive wave packet consists of the preparation of a circular state with a given principal quantum number @xmath69 followed by a smooth turn on of the microwave with frequency @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "such an approach has been tested numerically by integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the wave packet may be obtained with about 90% efficiency .    during the switch - on of the microwave , two regimes may be identified .",
    "for @xmath83 only slightly less than unity , ( small microwave amplitude ) , the resonant coupling between circular states is important only .",
    "the effective approximate hamiltonian in the vicinity of the fixed point corresponds then to the hamiltonian of a pendulum @xcite .",
    "this is the standard description of the resonance at first order @xcite . for low @xmath86",
    "the resonance island is small in action variable and , in effect , the pendulum states must be quite extended in the conjugate angle . in the rotating frame",
    ", this manifests itself as the fixed point being marginally stable along the @xmath87 direction at vanishing @xmath82 . for too small @xmath82 ,",
    "the binding force is too small and the wave packet eigenstate can be hardly considered to be localized in the very vicinity of the fixed point and , in turn , can not be considered as a localized wave packet in the laboratory frame .    with increasing microwave amplitude , the resonance island grows and may support a few ( depending on the size of the effective @xmath88 ) states .",
    "then , for a sufficiently large @xmath82 ( but not large enough to destabilize the resonance ) , the low excitations in the resonance island may be well described in the harmonic approximation .",
    "it is this regime of @xmath82 values which is of interest .",
    "the harmonic expansion of the hamiltonian @xmath33 in rotating frame around the equilibrium point allows one to find normal modes of the problem and obtain analytic predictions concerning the energies of wave packet eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath33 can be expanded in powers of position and momentum operators in the vicinity of the fixed point .",
    "the first order terms cancel because this is a fixed point . in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "only second order terms are kept ( including of course crossed position - momentum terms ) and we obtain : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the energy of the equilibrium point and @xmath91 denotes the displacement with respect to the fixed point .    the  diagonalization \" of this hamiltonian leads to the definition of the normal modes for the electronic motion . the calculation is tedious but straightforward : the frequencies of the 3 normal modes labelled by the @xmath92 indices are : @xmath93 with a shorthand notation @xmath94 the corresponding creation and annihilation operators in the 3 normal modes are linear combinations of position and momentum operators . in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "the motion perpendicular to the plane of microwave polarization decouples from the motion in the plane ; hence , the annihilation operator in the @xmath21-mode has the following simple expression : @xmath95 the creation operator @xmath96 being the adjoint of @xmath97 has a similar expression with imaginary part of opposite sign .",
    "the @xmath98 modes completely entangle the various coordinates and momenta @xmath99 they are neither the usual  cartesian \" normal modes along @xmath100 and @xmath101 , nor  circular \" normal modes along @xmath102 , but intermediate combinations .",
    "the annihilation operators are : @xmath103 with the normalization constants given by : @xmath104 the hamiltonian in the harmonic approximation can be expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators of the electronic normal modes @xcite : @xmath105    note the unusual minus sign in front of the @xmath106 term .",
    "this comes from the fact that the stable fixed point is not a minimum of the hamiltonian .",
    "however , the presence of crossed momentum - position terms assures the complete stability of the equilibrium point versus any small perturbation , in complete analogy with a usual potential minimum .",
    "let us denote the atomic eigenstates in the harmonic approximation as @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the excitation in a given @xmath109 mode @xcite .",
    "we will also  when needed ",
    "denote the floquet or dressed atom eigenstates ( thus including the microwave field degree of freedom ) as @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding energies are : @xmath111    it has been verified that exact floquet quasienergies , corresponding to dressed states localized in the vicinity of the equilibrium point in the rotating frame agree with the harmonic prediction , eq .",
    "( [ enharm ] ) , to within 10% of the mean level spacing @xcite for wave packets corresponding to @xmath112 or higher .",
    "this indicates that the harmonic approximation is quite satisfactory for sufficiently large @xmath69 ( sufficiently small @xmath3 ) .",
    "in particular , the `` ground state '' , @xmath113 corresponds to the most tightly bound state , centered at the fixed point in the rotating frame .",
    "its wavefunction has a gaussian shape in the harmonic approximation .",
    "the corresponding exact floquet ( dressed ) state @xcite is a non - dispersive wave packet since in the laboratory frame it moves in time around the nucleus with frequency @xmath3 following the stable circular periodic orbit .",
    "it is precisely the spontaneous emission from this state which will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the partial scheme of levels resulting from @xmath114 is shown in fig .",
    "[ levels ] for a few values of the `` total '' angular momentum @xmath57 .",
    "the neighboring ladders of states are shifted with respect to each other by the microwave frequency @xmath3 corresponding to different decoupled blocks of the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "transitions between quasienergy levels ( floquet or dressed states ) may be introduced by some additional perturbation . in particular one",
    "may consider the so - called floquet spectroscopy @xcite , absorption or stimulated emission between dressed states introduced by an additional laser or microwave field .",
    "it seems quite natural to study the possible effects of spontaneous emission of these states within the very same harmonic approximation .",
    "this allows to obtain close analytic expressions for the spontaneous decay rate .",
    "the validity of the harmonic approximation has been challenged strongly by farrelly and coworkers @xcite . by comparison of spontaneous spectra obtained in the harmonic approximation with full quantum mechanical results , we show later that their claims are not justified .",
    "to consider the spontaneous emission one has to consider the atom interacting not only with a single mode [ treated either classically ( [ hcl ] ) or quantum mechanically ( [ hq ] ) ] but a full electromagnetic field .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads , in atomic units  @xcite @xmath115 where subscript @xmath116 stands for @xmath117 or @xmath118 corresponding to the classical or quantum version of the description of the occupied microwave mode , respectively .",

    "the expansion in sperical waves is used ( which facilitates explicit transformation to the rotating frame ) , we expand the field into standard plane waves  @xcite .",
    "we normalize the modes per unit in @xmath124 space ( related to the frequency in atomic units by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the fine structure constant ) , then @xmath127 where h.c .",

    "note that in ( [ hsp ] ) the electric field operator is evaluated at origin , consistently with the dipole approximation assumed in this paper .",
    "similarly the free field hamiltonian is @xmath131    now we can use the fermi golden rule to calculate the decay rate due to spontaneous emission from an arbitrary initial state @xmath132 of the atom dressed by the microwave field to any final state @xmath133 , taking into account the density of modes for the photons @xcite . the result is : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the energy difference between the initial and final dressed states",

    "[ levels ] . in the process , the projection of the full angular momentum on the @xmath136 axis is conserved . here",
    ", this total angular momentum has three contributions : the atomic angular momentum @xmath137 , the angular momentum @xmath62 of the driving microwave photons ( all in the same mode ) and the angular momentum @xmath138 in the other modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "hence , we have @xmath139 constant . as spontaneous emission",
    "is here considered as a weak perturbation , it will simply induce transitions between eigenstates of the dressed atom , see eq .",

    ", the atomic angular momentum @xmath137 can change by at most one . when the spontaneous photon is emitted in an initially empty mode ( which is the process we are interested in ) , the number of photons in the driving microwave mode @xmath62 does not change .",
    "hence , @xmath57 changes by at most one , and the same is true ( with opposite sign ) for @xmath138 .",
    "thus , in the dipole approximation , there are only three possible processes .",

    ", the energy @xmath148 is gained in one mode and thus has to be lost by the dressed atom .",

    "are mainly @xmath23 polarized with respect to the @xmath21 axis .",
    "hence , the helicity of the photons ( with respect to their direction of emission , i.e. the quantity measured in an experiment ) is in general elliptical , depending on the direction of emission .    in summary , in the dressed atom picture as shown in fig .",
    "[ levels ] , the only possibilities for emitting a spontaneous photon is to decay to a state with lower energy in the same ladder or in one of the two neighboring ladders .",

    "plenty of processes with all 3 possible polarizations should exist .",

    "the general properties discussed in the preceding section are valid whatever initial state is chosen .",
    "when the initial state is a non - dispersive wave packet and when the scaled microwave field @xmath82 is sufficiently large , we can use the harmonic approximation described above .",
    "we will make this approximation throughout the rest of this section .",

    ", we can go beyond the above qualitative predictions and calculate the partial decay rates to the different final states analytically . to this end",

    "about 80% of the spontaneous photons emitted by the system are at the microwave frequency .",
    "elastic scattering of the microwave photons to other modes ( different direction ) is by far the dominant process .",
    "the radiation diagram of these photons has the standard dipolar shape ( this is identical for the three components as they are all due to the @xmath19 dipole operator ) .",
    "this dominance is easily understood from the different scalings of the three decay rates , eqs .",
    "( [ decayel])-([decaym ] ) discussed above .",
    "the dipole matrix element @xmath182 measures the static dipole , i.e. the position of the center of the non - dispersive wave packet .",
    "it is thus  in the harmonic approximation - equal to @xmath75 , the coordinate of the classical fixed point , of the order of @xmath183 in contrast , the non diagonal matrix elements @xmath184 or @xmath185 measure how the excited states explore the vicinity of the fixed point .",
    "they are of the order of @xmath186 i.e. about @xmath187 times smaller .",
    "this is why the corresponding decay rates are much smaller .",
    "because of the different scaling properties of the decay rates , it is easy to check that a change in the value of @xmath69 gives similar plots for the decay rates of the inelastic components as a function of the scaled microwave field ( they are just multiplied by a uniform numerical factor ) while the elastic component is relatively increased in proportion with @xmath188 in other words , in the semiclassical limit @xmath189 the inelastic components asymptotically vanish .",
    "another important observation is that , although the two inelastic components have dipole matrix elements of comparable magnitude ( see fig .  [ fdep]b ) , the decay rate of the @xmath169 component is several orders of magnitude smaller than the decay rate of the @xmath172 component , see fig .",
    "this is entirely due to the @xmath190 factor representing the density of electromagnetic mode . in practice",
    ", the @xmath169 component will be very difficult to detect .    finally ,",
    "when the microwave field is sufficiently small , the various quantities can be expanded in powers of the scaled field . in this limit",

    "of course , such a divergence in clearly unphysical and simply indicates the breakdown of the harmonic approximation . at lower field ,",
    "the pendulum approximation of the hamiltonian @xcite has to be used , restoring finite decay rates , roughly equally shared by the @xmath172 and @xmath3 components .",
    "the former approach to spontaneous emission of the non - dispersive wave packets @xcite has been carried out in the rotating frame using the hamiltonian eq.([hrot ] ) , or rather its generalization which includes also other non occupied electromagnetic modes . using the notion of rotational frequency shift found previously by the same authors",
    "@xcite , the frequency of the emission in the laboratory frame has been found . a single frequency , since the authors considered the emission at @xmath172 only assuming , incorrectly , that spontaneous emission of a photon in the rotating frame must lead to a decrease of the energy ( as it happens in the laboratory frame ) .",
    "to see the fallacy of this argument , consider the standard spontaneous decay of the circular @xmath193 hydrogenic state in the absence of any driving electromagnetic field . in the dipole approximation , it can decay spontaneously only to the @xmath70 circular state .",
    "consider the same situation in the frame rotating at frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the rotating frame is obtained from eq .",

    "the energy of the initial state in the rotating frame is then @xmath194 while the energy of the final state @xmath195 is greater than @xmath11 provided @xmath196 .",

    "this particular line ( upper to lower state in the doublet ) occurs at the frequency of the driving field plus the rabi frequency .",
    "but the emission may also take place from the lower to the upper state of the doublet ( at driving frequency minus the rabi frequency ) as well as from the lower ( upper ) state to  itself \" . in effect",
    "the resonance fluorescence spectrum has the famous mollow triplet structure @xcite with the dominant elastic component in the middle .",
    "this discussion shows that the rotating frame approach leads to quite counter intuitive picture . by comparison ,",
    "the dressed state picture presented in the previous section seems to be quite intuitive .",
    "one may easily verify that extending the calculation presented in @xcite to include the lines emitted at the microwave frequency @xmath3 ( which corresponds in the rotating frame to the emission from the wave packet state to itself ) as well as at @xmath169 leads to the same results as those obtained in the dressed atom picture above @xcite .",
    "this shows that both approaches lead , as it should be , to the same spontaneous emission rates .    from a practical point of view , as the decay at @xmath169 is much slower than the decay at @xmath172 ( see discussion above ) , the numbers given in @xcite can be considered correct@xcite if elastic scattering does not have to be taken into account .",
    "a non - trivial question is whether elastic scattering of photons has to considered as a decay process or not . in our opinion , this is simply a question not properly formulated .",
    "thinking resonance fluorescence in terms of decay is probably inadequate as the system is continuously fed with external photons .",
    "if one measures the population in the ground state wave packet @xmath197 this quantity will certainly decay because of inelastic components only .",
    "if one measures the spectrum radiated by the atom , the answer is completely different as the elastic component dominates .",
    "also , if one considers the widths of the various components , the elastic process will come into the game as it destroys the phase coherence of the initial wave packet and consequently broadens the line .",
    "a general discussion of such effects and more generally of resonance fluorescence in the framework of quantum optics can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us also note that the `` classical '' emission rate of an electron moving on a circular orbit presented in @xcite is incorrect .",
    "a classical charge moving on a circular orbit with frequency @xmath3 must emit photons at the same frequency . in our opinion , the only meaningful quantity is the decay rate of the _ energy _ in the atomic system .",
    "classically , it is proportional to the square of the acceleration and , for the classical periodic orbit at the microwave frequency , it is in atomic units @xcite : @xmath198 considering that , in the semiclassical limit @xmath189 the system radiates essentially photons as frequency @xmath3 , we immediately see that this classical rate _ exactly _ ( i.e. without additional numerical factor of the order of one ) coincides with the quantum decay rate of energy deduced from eq .",
    "( [ decayel ] ) .",
    "it also exactly corresponds to the decay rate of atomic circular states , as given in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , in the limit of vanishing microwave field @xmath199 in @xcite , the decay rate in the @xmath172 component is incorrectly compared to the relative decrease of the classical energy in time .",
    "the first quantity  as discussed above  is roughly @xmath69 times smaller than the elastic decay rate while the relative decrease of classical energy in time is also about @xmath69 times smaller than the rate of emission of photons because the energy of a radiated photon is about @xmath69 times smaller than the total energy .",
    "the two @xmath69 dependences cancel out , but not the numerical factors in front .",
    "this explains why a false classical - quantum correspondence ( within constant numerical factors ) is observed in @xcite .",
    "both classical and quantum decay rates are  in our opinion  underestimated by a @xmath200 factor .",
    "from the beginning of investigations on non - dispersive wave packets in the hydrogen atom driven by a circularly polarized microwave , there has been a controversy regarding the accuracy of the harmonic approximation used when introducing the wavepackets as gaussians centered around the equilibrium point @xcite , see section ii .",
    "firstly in a comment @xcite and later in a number of papers @xcite farrelly and coworkers claimed that `` highly anharmonic nature of the effective potential in the vicinity of the equilibrium point will cause any such putative coherent state to disperse .. '' unless the wave packet is built from states of unrealistically high quantum number ( @xmath201 ) . they have shown that an additional static magnetic field applied in the direction of microwave propagation ( @xmath136 axis ) allows to relatively decrease the importance of the anharmonic terms in the expansion around the equilibrium point .",
    "further they claim that `` because these extrema are locally harmonic their vacuum states are truly coherent states in the original sense of schrdinger '' @xcite ( by extrema one should understand global equilibrium points ) .",
    "our understanding of the phenomenon is slightly different . while farrelly and coworkers stress that the gaussian shape of the wave packet is essential for non spreading time evolution in the locally harmonic potential , we adopt a bit less narrow - minded point of view .",
    "we have shown @xcite that , even if the harmonic approximation is only partially valid , there will be a one - to - one correspondence between the quasienergy states of the approximate harmonic hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) , and the full hamiltonian in the rotating frame , eq .  ( [ hrot ] ) .",
    "in particular , the ground state of the local harmonic approximation ( referred to above as ground state wave packet ) is a good approximation to an _ exact _ eigenstate of the full problem ( or via the unitary transformation to the corresponding floquet or dressed state ) .",
    "we refer to this exact eigenstate of the full atom+microwave field problem as the non - dispersive wave packet since :    * it is a linear combination of atomic states ; * it is centered at the stable equilibrium point in the rotating frame , thus it follows the classical circular periodic orbit of the problem in the laboratory frame ;    thus fulfilling standard textbook criteria for `` a wave packet '' .",
    "being an eigenstate of @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ hrot ] ) , the state is rigorously non spreading provided we neglect the coupling to the continuum ",
    "i.e. the possibility of ionization .",
    "we have shown @xcite that typical lifetimes for the ionization exceed many thousands of kepler periods ( reaching up to @xmath2 kepler periods for @xmath112 or more ) .    in our understanding of the phenomenon ,",
    "the validity of the harmonic approximation is not crucial for the very existence of non - dispersive wave packets in the hydrogen atom driven by a circularly polarized microwave .",
    "moreover , the phenomenon is more general and , as mentioned in the introduction , may be found in other systems such as atoms driven by a linearly polarized microwave @xcite or one - dimensional models @xcite supporting stable classical 1:1 resonance islands . in the general case",
    ", the wave packet preserves its shape at intervals equal to the period of the external driving , only in the circular polarization problem ( due to the additional symmetry which allows for the complete removal of the time - dependence ) the wave packet shape is the same at all times .",
    "there is no reason to restrict the notion of non - dispersive ( or non spreading ) wave packet to a single particular situation which can be made almost fully harmonic .",
    "one should also remember that even in the presence of a magnetic field , a case favored by farrelly and coworkers , the potential is also only approximately harmonic , and gaussian wavepackets will eventually disperse .",
    "while wave packets in our sense , being single dressed states , will not . in any case , the addition of a magnetic field does not change the nature of the problem , it may just keep some anharmonic terms smaller .    while not necessary for the very existence of non - dispersive wave packets ,",
    "the harmonic approximation is useful for analytic evaluation of different properties , such as spontaneous emission discussed above . in view of farrelly and coworkers remarks",
    ", it would seem that the results obtained in the previous section are incorrect .",
    "the simplest way to check this statement is to evaluate the  exact \" spontaneous emission spectrum from the ground quasienergy eigenstate of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the presence of the anharmonic terms in the full hamiltonian has to manifest itself in the break - up of the selection rules discussed in section ii .",
    "instead of three possible lines in the @xmath23 emission , one should expect a multitude of lines . using the harmonic level assignment",
    ", the @xmath165 wave packet may then decay to e.g. states approximated by @xmath202 with @xmath203 being larger than unity ( with @xmath44 even since @xmath23 dipole element may link states of same @xmath21-parity only ) . also , due to couplings introduced by nonlinear terms , spontaneous emission with other ( i.e. @xmath154 or @xmath145 ) polarizations becomes possible .",
    "thus , the spontaneous emission spectrum provides a useful test of the validity of the harmonic approximation .",
    "having at our disposal the computer code which allows reliably to find the exact quasienergy states of the problem @xcite , it has been sufficient to evaluate dipole matrix elements between the exact quasienergy states .",
    "the resulting squared dipole moments are shown in fig .",
    "[ exdip ] together with the corresponding squared dipoles as given by the harmonic approximation , eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) , presented as three crosses .",
    "observe that , the harmonic approximation works quite well .",
    "the selection rules are well preserved , the frequencies of the emission ( line positions ) agree very well , the dipole values ( heights of the lines ) agree within 10% for all three lines .",
    "this shows that the harmonic approximation is quite good , _ in the absence of any magnetic field , _ not only for the ground state wave packet , @xmath113 but also for primary @xmath161 [ state @xmath204 and @xmath106 [ state @xmath205 excitations .",
    "observe that the height of the peak at @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath206 involving the wavefunction of the ground state wave packet only .",
    "the sidebands , corresponding to transitions to excited wave packets provide independent tests of the corresponding wavefunctions .    fig .",
    "[ exsp ] shows the corresponding spontaneous emission rates .",
    "the component at @xmath169 is not visible due to the low frequency of the emission .",
    "on the other hand , the spectrum at high frequencies is enhanced by cubic power of the frequency factor coming from the photonic density of states . here ,",
    "careful inspection of the spectrum corresponding to exact eigenstates reveals a tiny peak centered at @xmath207 ( indicated by an arrow in the figure ) .",
    "such a transition is forbidden in the harmonic approximation , its presence indicates that the harmonic approximation is not exact .",
    "still , the smallness of anharmonic terms strongly indicates that the harmonic approximation works well , at least for the typical value @xmath208    if one considers lower @xmath69 ( say around @xmath209 ) when the effective @xmath12 is bigger , the anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian become more important and the spontaneous emission spectrum contains other lines , at @xmath210 with @xmath211 or combinations , e.g. at @xmath212 .",
    "this nicely correlates with our study of ionization mechanism @xcite . starting around",
    "@xmath213 ionization clearly occurs via a chaos assisted tunneling mechanism ( obeying exponential behavior with @xmath12 change ) with clear deviations from such a behavior for lower @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , much weaker microwave amplitudes ( say @xmath214 ) when the resonance island is so small that the quantum eigenstate does not fit into it , lead to a similar behavior of the spontaneous emission spectrum - the presence of overtones .",
    "still we have checked that in quite a broad range of @xmath215 the harmonic approximation works similarly to the case shown in fig .",
    "[ exdip ] and fig .",
    "[ exsp ] , provided no accidental avoided crossing with other floquet states occurs @xcite .",
    "while the calculations presented in this paper are consistently done at the lowest order of the harmonic approximation using cartesian coordinates , similar calculations can be done using , for example , the spherical coordinates @xcite .",
    "consistently , the results at lowest order are of course identical .",
    "however , it is known that  within the harmonic approximation ",
    "the wavefunction in spherical coordinates is a better approximation to the",
    " exact \" wavefunction than the corresponding one in cartesian coordinates , as it incorporates some of the anharmonic terms ; the price to pay is the breaking of the selection rules , eqs .",
    "( [ sr1])-([sr2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the transition rates calculated using harmonic wavefunctions in spherical coordinates incorporate already some of the higher order terms and might be closer to the  exact \" results . note , however that if the calculation is performed consitently at any order in perturbation theory ( the anharmonic terms being the perturbation ) , the results should of course be independent of the choice of coordinates .",
    "it is worth stressing again that , in the semiclassical limit ( small @xmath3 or large @xmath69 ) , the dominant contribution to the spontaneous emission comes from the elastic component at frequency @xmath3 which _ does not _ destroy the wave packet but rather leads to the decoherence in its time - evolution .",
    "the wave packet converts the energy of the driving photon into a spontaneously emitted photon , moving at the same time on the circular orbit .    from a practical point of view ,",
    "the spontaneous emission rates are several orders of magnitude smaller than the ionization rate in a typical situation @xmath0 and @xmath216 @xcite , and thus unlikely to be observable . however , this ratio can be made smaller by increasing @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , as shown in @xcite , the typical ionization rate decreases _ exponentially _ with @xmath69 ( because it is due a chaos assisted tunneling process ) while the spontaneous decay rates decrease _ algebraically _ with @xmath188 for very large @xmath217 spontaneous emission will eventually become the dominant process . for @xmath216 ,",
    "the cross - over should take place around @xmath218 which makes it very difficult to observe experimentally .",
