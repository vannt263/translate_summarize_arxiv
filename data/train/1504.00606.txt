    "the interaction of these methods is successfully applied to exploit rates of convergence of the asymptotic normal approximation for functionals of gaussian random measures ( see @xcite ) , for functionals of general poisson random measures ( cfr . @xcite and @xcite ) and , more recently , to fix convergence criteria from the point of view of spectral theory of general markov diffusion generators ( see @xcite ) .",

    "introduced in the literature by @xcite , spherical needlets are characterized by some main properties which makes them an excellent tool for statistical analysis , such as their concentration in both fourier and space domains .",
