    "crisis situations such as disasters brought on by natural hazards present unique challenges to those who study them , creating conditions that call for particular research methods  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we survey methods for studying disasters from the perspective of information processing and management , specifically methods for processing social media content .",
    "crisis situations  particularly those with little to no warning ( known as  sudden onset crises\")generate a situation that is rife with questions , uncertainties , and the need to make quick decisions , often with minimal information . when it comes to information scarcity , research in recent years has uncovered the increasingly important role of social media communications in disaster situations , and shown that information broadcast via social media can enhance situational awareness during a crisis situation  @xcite .",
    "however , social media communications during disasters are now so abundant that it is necessary to sift through hundreds of thousands , and even millions , of data points to find information that is most useful during a given event .",
    "the goal of this survey is to provide computer science researchers and software developers with computational methods they can use to create tools for formal response agencies , humanitarian organizations , and other end users with a way to successfully identify , filter , and organize the overwhelming amount of social media data that are produced during any given crisis .",
    "such tools can help stakeholders make time - critical  and potentially life - saving  decisions .      *",
    "brief history . * the use of internet technologies to gather and disperse information in disaster situations , as well as to communicate among stakeholders , dates back to the late 1990s .",
    "internet historians point to online newsgroups and email clients that were used to coordinate protests in indonesia in 1998  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are cases of websites being set up in response to crises in 2003  @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , 2004 is the first year in which a user - generated content website was used in response to a crisis ; after the indian ocean tsunami of december 26 that year , an electronic bulletin board was set up and moderated for 10 days .",
    "in addition , in the aftermath of hurricane katrina , which struck the city of new orleans in the united states in 2005 , significant emergency response activity took place on myspace  @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest known cases of people using microblogging service twitter in an emergency was during severe wildfires that took place near san diego , california ( in the united states ) in 2007 .",
    "since then , it has become common practice for affected populations and concerned others to use twitter to communicate , ask questions , collect and spread information , and organize response efforts ( among other tasks )  @xcite .    * today . * the growing adoption of social media during disasters has created opportunities for information propagation that would not exist otherwise .",
    "emergency response agencies routinely post information such as emergency alerts and advice through these channels , but social media enables much more than `` top - down '' communications .",
    "people post situation - sensitive information on social media related to what they experience , witness , and/or hear from other sources  @xcite .",
    "this practice allows both affected populations and those outside the impact zone to learn about the situation _ first hand _ and in near real - time . we know",
    "that information posted to social media platforms in time- and safety - critical circumstances can be of great value to those tasked with making decisions in these fraught situations .",
    "previous research has shown that information which contributes to situational awareness is reported via twitter ( and other social media platforms ) during mass emergencies  @xcite .",
    "now , those tasked with formal response efforts  from local fire departments to international aid agencies  are working to incorporate information broadcast on social media platforms into their processes and procedures .",
    "many emergency responders and humanitarian officials recognize the value of the information posted on social media platforms by members of the public ( and others ) , and are interested in finding ways to quickly and easily locate and organize that information that is of most use to them  @xcite .",
    "some agencies have even begun to formally incorporate social media monitoring and communication during mass emergency situations .",
    "the american red cross ( arc ) , in a survey , reported the effectiveness of social media and mobile apps .",
    "arc recently opened their social media digital operations center for humanitarian relief .",
    "the goals of the center are to  source additional information from affected areas during emergencies to better serve those who need help ; spot trends and better anticipate the public s needs ; and connect people with the resources they need , like food , water , shelter or even emotional support . \" though the arc is currently one of the few ( possibly the only ) formal agencies to support such a center , it is likely that similar operations will begin within other organizations . among other similar examples , the australia crisis tracker , which is a machine - learning based tool to filter spam and categorize data into different event types , is also deployed with the australian red cross .",
    "though formal response agencies express interest in incorporating social media into their processes , obstacles exist .",
    "for example , a recent survey by the us congressional research service cites administrative cost as a significant barrier to adopting social media during emergencies : `` the number of personnel required to monitor multiple social media sources , verify the accuracy of incoming information , and respond to and redirect incoming messages is also uncertain ... responding to each message in a timely manner could be time consuming and might require an increase in the number of employees ... ''",
    "@xcite others have expressed concerns including issues related to roles , responsibilities , and liabilities ; difficulties evaluating the veracity , trustworthiness , and reliability of information ; and information overload in general  @xcite .",
    "computational methods can help overcome some of these obstacles , by reducing the amount of information to be examined by humans .",
    "automatic methods are necessary when human computation is limited , and in the following sections , we detail what those methods entail .",
    "sociologists began researching human behavior in mass emergency situations long before the internet , or even modern computing .",
    "the purpose of this section is not to provide the reader with an exhaustive list of sociology of disaster literature ; we highlight a few foundational readings that are helpful for the computer science , information science , technology , and social media scholars to gain quick insight into the rich and varied field of sociology of disaster .",
    "quarantelli s 2002 chapter `` the disaster research center ( drc ) field studies of organized behavior in the crisis time period of disasters '' ( in _ methods of disaster research _ edited by r.a .",
    "stallings  ) provides a brief history of one of the foremost disaster research institutes in the united states .",
    "quarantelli gives background on the disaster research center , and explains the strategic as well as academically - oriented decisions that were made in order to highlight the importance of studying the social science aspects of disaster . in his edited volume `` disasters by design , ''",
    "dennis s. mileti   and the contributing authors aim to reach a general ( i.e. non - academic ) audience and provide background on disasters caused by natural hazards .",
    "the volume is comprised of `` synthesized statements of what is known , collectively , about hazards and human coping strategies . ''",
    "mileti and colleagues point to causes of disaster , which happen when three major systems  the physical , social , and built environments  interact in complex ways .",
    "the authors goal is to give the reader a way to understand how to study disaster situations , with a final goal of helping members of the public create more resilient communities .",
    "when it comes to combining studies of disaster with the use of information technology , including social media , the harvard humanitarian initiative   presents an in - depth analysis of the response to the earthquake in haiti in january 2010 . with a stronger focus in social media , a recent survey by hughes , peterson and palen considers the motivating factors of emergency responders regarding their use of social media data .",
    "the authors describe the challenges they face , best practices regarding the adoption of social media by formal response organizations , and also touch on instances of integrated , end - to - end systems that are currently being built to meet these needs  @xcite .",
    "in addition , an article by palen and liu   was one of the first to provide an early assessment regarding how information and communication technology can support the participation of the public during crisis situations . since then , many articles that focus on the role of social media in disaster have been published , but the two we mention here provide a good `` first glance '' to readers who are new to the field .    our brief overview of foundational reading would not be complete without mentioning the much - discussed issue of trust and the use of social media .",
    "a recent acm computing survey looks at this very topic  @xcite .",
    "the authors review the various definitions of `` trust '' from a variety of academic disciplines , discuss the factors that contribute to notions of trust , and combine the complex and much - scrutinized idea of trust with computing and social network research .",
    "the overarching problem we aim to confront in this article is that of extracting time - critical information from social media that is useful for emergency responders , affected communities , and other concerned populations in disaster situations .",
    "we note that social media analysis has been used for a number of applications in the domains of economics , politics ( e.g.  ) and public health ( e.g.  ) ; for a survey , see  . even if we consider only applications to time - critical settings , we note that often the same methods described in this survey can be applied to the analysis of social media during mass converge events , such as large political conventions , concerts , or sports events ; or for monitoring the performance of a media campaign or a televised debate , among similar applications . however , while many of the methods and algorithms that we describe can be used for other purposes , we explain them from the perspective of their applications to mass emergencies , a topic that has a specific scientific and technical community , and that targets a particular set of use - cases .",
    "the following two sections briefly describe our target end - user audience , and their information needs ( section  [ sec : users ] ) , and end - to - end integrated systems ( section  [ sec : systems ] ) .",
    "the subsequent sections form the main technical part of this survey and present a systematic analysis of the computational methods we cover .",
    "* section  [ sec : data ] starts with a general characterization of social media messages broadcast during disasters .",
    "next , it introduces methods for programmatically acquiring data from social media , and for pre - processing the data . *",
    "section  [ sec : event - detection ] covers methods for the detection of new events , which involves detecting the first message on a given topic or sub - topic .",
    "the section also covers how to track these events , i.e. how to collect further messages belonging to the same topic . *",
    "section  [ sec : finding_information ] outlines methods to mine and aggregate information .",
    "these methods include unsupervised classification ( and clustering ) , supervised classification , information extraction , and summarization .",
    "* section  [ sec : semantics ] presents how semantic technologies can be applied in this domain .",
    "this corresponds , first , to enrich the content with semantic information , and second , to use an ontology for disaster management to describe the content of the messages .",
    "the final section concludes the survey , and outlines current research directions .",
    "much of the research we present here focuses on the computational aspects of processing social media messages in time- and safety - critical situations .",
    "it is additionally important to consider the end users of these technological solutions ; those who benefit from having curated information that describes a disaster or crisis and enhances situational awareness , including formal response agencies , humanitarian organizations , and members of the public .      ideally , to understand how the public participates in social media during crises",
    ", we should start by asking how the public reacts in general to crises .",
    "contrary to hollywood renditions of disaster situations , human response to crises is not one of panic and mayhem  @xcite .",
    "victims of disaster do not lose control , run amok , nor flee the area in fear .",
    "instead , they make quick decisions based on the information available to them at the time , which often allow them to save their own lives as well as help those around them  @xcite .",
    "neighbors , friends , and other members of the public are the first to respond when a disaster strikes .",
    "they rush to the scene to perform search and rescue operations , administer first aid , and perform critical tasks necessary in the first moments of response .",
    "often , these `` first responders '' are victims of the disaster themselves  @xcite .",
    "the role of the public in disaster response efforts is critical , and with the growing use of social media to gather and disperse information , organize relief efforts , and communicate , those members of the public who can play a valuable role in these situations is no longer limited to those in the area of impact .",
    "as   explains , emergencies do not render victims incapable of helping themselves and others , nor create a situation in which they are unable to make intelligent , personally meaningful decisions .",
    "what emergencies _ do _ create is an environment in which new and perhaps unexpected problems are presented , which members of the public are called upon to solve .",
    "research in recent years on the use of social media in disasters shows how members of the public , formal response agencies , and other stakeholders have taken to online outlets to perform tasks such as communicating about hospital availability  @xcite , coordinating medical responses  @xcite , and communicating with the public during various crises  @xcite , among many others .",
    "these users interact in complex ways including producing , distributing and organizing content  @xcite .",
    "the recognition that social media communications are a valid and useful source of information throughout the disaster lifecycle ( preparation , impact , response , and recovery ) is increasing among the many stakeholders who take action in disaster situations .",
    "in particular , members of the public , formal response agencies , and local , national and international aid organizations are all aware of the ability to use social media to gather and disperse timely information in the aftermath of disaster , but the specific information they seek  and their ability to put it to use  may differ  @xcite .    depending on the circumstances of the disaster , and what roles and duties the various stakeholders are responsible for , their specific information needs will vary .",
    "for example , in a wildfire situation that affects a community , members of a formal response organization such as local police or area firefighters can benefit from information such as where people are smelling smoke , what precautions they are taking ( e.g. clearing brush , watering yards ) , and what traffic patterns look like . in a large - scale , sudden - onset disaster such as a typhoon or earthquake , humanitarian agencies , such as the various branches of the united nations , benefit from information that details the current situation `` on the ground , '' such as where electricity has been disabled , or where people are without food and water .",
    "in any disaster situation , members of the public play a variety of roles and take on many tasks ; the information they find valuable may be very personal  i.e .",
    "hearing that a friend or loved one is safe , or it may be more broadly applicable , such as the status of a certain neighborhood or town .    overall , the information any individual , group , or organization finds useful and seeks out in a disaster will depend upon their goals .",
    "is it a group interested in providing food to children ?",
    "is it an organization that can set up a field hospital ?",
    "is it an individual living in a foreign country who is concerned about her or his family ?",
    "the different types of information sought by these different stakeholders may be broadcast on twitter , but to find it quickly , users rely on technological methods to sift through the millions of tweets broadcast at any given time to find useful information . further information and a deeper perspective on users of social media in disaster can be found in and .",
    "table  [ tbl : systems ] provides examples of existing systems described in the literature that extract crisis - relevant information from social media .",
    "the systems we include have varying degrees of maturity ; some have been deployed in real - life situations , while others remain under development .",
    ".example systems described in the academic literature that extract crisis - relevant information from social media .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     table  [ tbl : crisis_ontologies ] lists some of the ontologies that have been introduced in recent years .",
    "some examples from this table :    * the _ humanitarian exchange language _ ( hxl ) is an ontology created in 2011 and 2012 and is currently under review ; it describes 49 classes and 37 properties .",
    "the focus of hxl is mainly on four areas : organization ( i.e. , formal response agencies like military , charities , ngos ) , disaster ( i.e. , classification of disasters such as natural , man - made ) , geography ( i.e. , event location , geo - location of displaced people ) , and damage ( i.e. , damages related to humans , infrastructure ) . * _ management of a crisis _ ( moac ) is an ontology with 92 classes and 21 properties covering four areas : disaster , damage , processes ( i.e. , rescue , search , evacuation processes ) , and resources ( i.e. , services , vehicles , tents ) . hxl and moac have elements in common : in both cases the objective is to describe different aspects of a crisis , including its effects , the needs of those affected , and the response to the crisis . * _ integrated data for events analysis _ ( idea ) is a framework for coding social , economic and political events .",
    "it is used in the _ global database of events , language and tone _ ( gdelt ) , which is a machine - generated list of event data extracted from news reports .",
    "* _ service - orientierte architekturen zur untersttzung von netzwerken i m rahmen oeffentlicher sicherheit _",
    "( `` service - oriented architectures supporting networks of public security , '' soknos ) is an ontology for information integration for resource planning , including damage and resource categorization during disasters .    to support communication among different ontology - based systems ,",
    "the problem of ontology heterogeneity needs to be solved by performing an _ ontology mapping _ , which is the process of mapping the concepts of two ontologies from the same or from overlapping domains .",
    "many approaches have been proposed to perform ontology mapping .",
    "for instance ,   treated this as a decision - making problem and proposed an approach based on bayesian decision theory . for a survey on ontology mapping techniques ,",
    "the ontologies in table  [ tbl : crisis_ontologies ] are crisis - specific , but not social - media specific .",
    "however , they can be combined with ontologies describing social media concepts such as users , tagging , sharing , and linking .",
    "for instance , the `` semantically interlinked online communities '' ( sioc ) ontology , originally developed to model sites such as blogs and online forums , has recently been extended to support the modeling of microblogs by adding concepts such as _ follower _ or _",
    "follows_. an ontology specific to twitter appears in   and includes user sentiments and locations , while   enables semantic tagging of social media data through an ontology called meaning - of - a - tag ( moat ) . for a survey on ontologies developed for social media ,",
    "in a relatively short time period  roughly 4 to 6 years  the research community working on the topics we have covered here has achieved a fairly high degree of maturity with respect to filtering , classifying , processing , and aggregating social media data during crises .    however , the underlying ( although sometimes explicitly stated ) claim behind this line of work , i.e. that this research is _ useful _ for the public and/or formal response agencies , that it has the potential to save lives and/or property during an emergency , remains to be seen . while there are notable exceptions including the american red cross , the us federal emergency management agency , un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs and the filipino government , among others",
    ", the use of social media is still experimental for many organizations and not yet part of their normal , day - to - day operations .",
    "there are two main directions in which we see future research going .",
    "first , continue deepening the data processing capabilities that have been the main focus of computing research on this topic thus far .",
    "second , engage more deeply with human - centered approaches toward making the computing research the foundation of viable systems that emergency responders can implement .",
    "* from situational awareness to decision support .",
    "* the systems we described in section  [ sec : systems ] for processing social media during disasters have a strong focus on situational awareness , which is an important first step but might not be enough for emergency management . during an emergency",
    ", social media is used as an information source in order to make decisions .",
    "therefore , next - generation systems should be designed and evaluated in terms of their decision - support capabilities .",
    "this might even include forecasting using signals from social media .    * extending to other types of media .",
    "* data from various sources should be processed and integrated : `` the strategies of emergency services organizations must also recognize the significant interweaving of social and other online media with conventional broadcast and print media . ''",
    "there are some examples of the processing of other types of information items during crises , including short messages ( sms )  @xcite , news articles in traditional news media and blogs  @xcite , and images  @xcite .    * verifying information .",
    "* systems that receive user - generated content are always exposed to abuse , which can be countered by a mixture of automatic and manual methods .",
    "for instance , algorithms to detect false product reviews are deployed by most major online retailers  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) . in the crisis domain ,",
    "determining the credibility of information posted on social media is a major concern for those who process information ( e.g. computer scientists , and software engineers ) , and for the information consumers ( e.g. the public and formal response organizations )  @xcite .",
    "automatic classification can be used to filter out content that is unlikely to be considered credible  @xcite , or to annotate messages seen by users with credibility scores automatically  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the public itself can be mobilized to confirm or discredit a claim through crowdsourcing  @xcite .      * designing with the users .",
    "* considering the number of systems that have been designed and built so far , there is little research on how usable and useful are those systems ( with some exceptions , e.g.  @xcite ) .    how should information be presented to users ?",
    "how should users interact with it ?",
    "the key to answering these question lies with the users themselves , who should be brought into the process of designing the systems , dashboards , and/or visualizations they require to serve their needs . a highly regarded methodology for achieving",
    "this is _ participatory design _  @xcite .    *",
    "helping governments and ngos communicate with the public . * three days _ before _ typhoon pablo made its landfall in the philippines in 2012 , government officials were already calling users to use the hashtag `` # pabloph '' for updates about the typhoon .",
    "an effective use of hashtags has also been encouraged by the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs  @xcite .",
    "computational methods can be used not only to help formal response agencies choose which hashtags to use , but more generally , to help them design and evaluate effective communication strategies in social media ( see   regarding best practices for crisis communications using social media ) .",
    "the conversation between the public and formal organizations can also be conducted through platforms that , instead of passively waiting for people to post information , ask them directly to answer certain questions that are relevance for the emergency response or relief operations  @xcite .    * social media for coordinating actions . * the final output of the processing of social media messages",
    "is not limited to the presentation of information in a given format .",
    "computational methods can be applied to augment the information in a number of ways .",
    "for instance , varga et al .",
    "@xcite match problem - tweets ( `` infant formula is sold out in sendai '' ) to solution - tweets ( `` jusco supermarket is selling infant formula '' ) , and purohit et al .",
    "@xcite match tweets describing urgent need of resources ( `` we are coordinating a clothing drive for families affected '' ) with tweets describing the intention to donate them ( `` i ve a bunch of clothes i want to donate '' ) .",
    "we regard these efforts as preliminary results towards the ability to use social media as a mechanism for coordination of action in future emergency situations .",
    "a recent special issue of the journal on computer supported collaborative work explores various ways in which computing can support collaboration and coordination during an emergency  @xcite .    * acknowledgments .",
    "* we are thankful to jakob rogstadius and per aarvik who pointed us to historical information .",
    "we would like to thank our collaborators and co - authors patrick meier , alexandra olteanu , and hemant purohit ."
