    "there is a growing research effort to utilize the electromagnetic environment like photonics crystals , plasmonic nanostructures or dielectric cavities to control and modify the electronic excitation , relaxation and emission processes  @xcite .",

    "the blackbody radiation such as the solar light is a popular choice for incoherent light source .",
    "however , in the presence of the metallic environment and at shorter distances from the metal , the evanescent field will be dominant  @xcite .",
    "since the evanescent field near the metallic surfaces is different from the blackbody radiation due to surface polariton modes  @xcite , the non - equilibrium energy transfer in the near field region provides a new way to look at the radiation at the nanoscale different from the blackbody case  @xcite . to this end",
    ", the forster resonant energy transfer ( fret ) under the influence of the evanescent field from the metal has been studied experimentally in recent years  @xcite . nevertheless , it is still a topic of debate how the fret in molecular systems is affected by the surrounding electromagnetic environment .",
    "our previous approach  @xcite to study fret in the presence of the evanescent field was an extension of a classical model developed by silbey and chance to study the emission and energy transfer near the metallic surfaces  @xcite .",
    "statistically , the thermal near - field reservoir is similar to shared phonon reservoir  @xcite due to the spatial correlation of the evanescent field in the vicinity of the metal , causing enhancement of the energy transfer .",
    "however , coupling of the molecular system to the evanescent field also causes greater excitation energy loss from the molecule to the metal .    in this paper , a quantum approach based on the polaron master equation",
    "is derived to study the population and coherence dynamics of the excitation energy in molecular systems . in the current framework",

    "the metal surface can bridge the energy transfer between donor and acceptor , albeit at the cost of losing electronic excitation energy to the metal in the form of heat , which can not be accounted for in a classical theory .",

    "<S> we present a quantum framework based on a density matrix of a dimer system to investigate the quantum dynamics of excitation energy transfer ( eet ) in the presence of the evanescent field from the metal and the phonon bath . due to the spatial correlation of the electric field in the vicinity of the metal , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density of the evanescent field is similar to that of a shared phonon bath . </S>",
    "<S> however , the eet dynamics under the influence of the evanescent field is an open and a new problem . </S>",
    "<S> here we use a thin metallic film to investigate the effect of the evanescent field on the excitation energy transfer in a dimer system based on a density matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that a thin metallic film enhances the energy transfer rate at the expense of absorbing energy during the process . </S>",
    "<S> since the spectral density of the evanescent field is affected by the geometry of the medium and the distance of a dimer system from the medium , our results demonstrate the possibility to tune eet based on material geometry and distances . </S>",
    "<S> our model also serves as an expansion to quantum heat engine model and provides a framework to investigate the eet in light harvesting molecular networks under the influence of the evanescent field . </S>"
