    "<S> we have expressed the nonlinear optical absorption of a semiconductor in terms of its linear spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we determined that the two - photon absorption coefficient in a strong dc - electric field of a direct gap semiconductor can be expressed as the product of a differential operator times the convolution integral of the linear absorption without a dc - electric field and an airy function . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied this formalism to calculate the two - photon absorption coefficient and nonlinear refraction for gaas and znse using their linear absorption and have found excellent agreement with available experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental limitation in non - linear spectroscopy is the requirement for large peak laser intensities because a coherent @xmath0-photon process ( @xmath1 ) has a small cross section . with the limited availability of continuous laser sources having broad bandwidths and good coherence </S>",
    "<S> , nonlinear spectroscopy is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast linear absorption cross sections are much larger , especially in semiconductors close to a critical point ( van hove singularities ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it would be ideal if the nonlinear properties , such as the two - photon absorption and nonlinear refraction of a semiconductor , could be predicted from their linear spectrum , which is relatively straightforward to obtain . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we present a theoretical approach to predict the two - photon absorption spectrum of a direct gap semiconductor based only on its linear absorption spectrum close to the band - edge . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism developed here also gives information about the role of a dc - electric field on the nonlinear optical response of semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we have also applied the kramers - kronig relation to calculate the nonlinear refraction and have obtained excellent agreement with the available experimental data for @xmath2 and @xmath3 direct - gap semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this theory could be of great significance towards identifying promising nonlinear optical materials for application in diverse areas such as optical switching and optical limiting .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of electric field on the dielectric constant of solids has been extensively investigated in the past @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect , known as the franz - keldysh ( fk ) effect @xcite , has been used as a tool in spectroscopy to modulate the energy gap and resolve details of the band structure otherwise embedded in a broadband background @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we reported the calculation of the nonlinear absorption coefficient in the presence of a very strong electric field for direct as well as indirect gap semiconductors and extended the formalism to the n - photon process @xcite . at the heart of the calculation </S>",
    "<S> is the use of a modified volkov wavefunction that includes the effect of the electric field in one direction ( airy function ) , and uses the s - matrix to calculate the n - photon transition rate in first - order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we worked in the effective mass approximation and assumed that the momentum matrix elements were independent of electron - hole wave vector k. we also assumed that the optical field only modified the final energy of the electron - hole pair . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we considered an isotropic solid with a full valence band and an empty conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting generalized n - photon absorption coefficient in the presence of a dc - electric field was given by @xcite : @xmath4^{n-1}\\left[\\frac{n(2n-3)!!}{((n-1)!)^{3}}\\right]\\left(\\frac{m_{\\mu}}{\\hbar^{2}}\\right)^{n}\\int_{\\epsilon_{o}^{(n)}}^{\\infty}(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{o}^{(n)})^{n-1}\\mid ai(\\epsilon)^{2}\\mid d\\epsilon\\label{eq : betan}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the characteristic energy of the dc electric field @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the electron effective mass , @xmath8 is mass of the electron in the conduction band , @xmath9 is the semiconductor index of refraction , @xmath10 is the airy function , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are given by : @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron bare mass , and @xmath18 is the interband momentum matrix elements . using the following property of the airy function @xcite:@xmath19\\int_{o}^{\\infty}t^{n-1}\\mid ai(t+x)\\mid^{2}dt\\label{eq : ai}\\ ] ] the integral in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : betan ] can be reduced after successive applications of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ai ] and using the below property:@xmath20 obtained from @xcite , where @xmath21 . as a consequence , the @xmath0-photon absorption coefficient @xmath22 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : betan ] , can be expressed in terms of the linear absorption as :    @xmath23^{n-1}\\left[\\frac{n(2n-3)!!}{\\left[(n-1)!\\right]^{2}\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(2i-1)}\\right]\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^{2}}{d\\epsilon_{o}^{(n)2}}-2\\epsilon_{o}^{(n)}\\right]^{n-1}\\times\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\int\\beta^{(1)}(e^{'})\\frac{\\omega^{'}}{\\omega}ai\\left(\\frac{e^{'}-n\\hbar\\omega}{\\omega}\\right)de^{'}\\label{eq : betan2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is given by : @xmath25^{3/2}(e^{'}-e_{g})^{1/2}=\\frac{\\alpha_{b}^{'}(2m)^{3/2}}{(2\\pi)^{2}\\hbar^{2}}\\frac{1}{e^{'}}(e^{'}-e_{g})^{1/2}\\label{eq : beta1}\\ ] ] where we have redefined @xmath12 such that the new @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be used as fitting parameters for the linear absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we see that eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : betan2 ] reduces to the well - know convolution theorem for @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ we call eq . _ </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : betan2 ] _ the @xmath0-photon absorption convolution theorem ( i.e. the nonlinear convolution theorem ) and view the differential operator as the @xmath0-photon absorption operator_. in the case of @xmath29 , the two - photon absorption coefficient is given by:@xmath30\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\beta^{(1)}(e^{'})\\frac{\\omega^{'}}{\\omega}ai\\left(\\frac{e^{'}-2\\hbar\\omega}{\\omega}\\right)de^{'}\\label{eq : beta2}\\ ] ] eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : beta2 ] contains a very remarkable result : _ the two - photon absorption is given by a convolution of the linear absorption_. so if the spectrum of the linear absorption close to the band edge is known / measured then eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : beta2 ] can be used to generate the nonlinear absorption spectrum of the semiconductor . also , using the familiar kramers - kronig ( _ kk _ ) relationship for nonlinear optics @xcite along with eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : beta2 ] we get : @xmath31 for the nonlinear refraction .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , there have been reports on the development of a new technique to measure the nonlinear absorption in a broad spectral range using z - scan and a supercontinuum laser source @xcite . using this technique </S>",
    "<S> , the spectral distribution of the two - photon absorption for @xmath3 was measured . to test the above theory , </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the two - photon absorption for @xmath2 and @xmath3 semiconductors using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : beta2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gaas - data](a ) , the absorption coefficient for @xmath2 was estimated using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : beta1 ] and using @xmath26 and @xmath27 as fitting parameters , with low temperature experimental values taken from @xcite ( where the absorption edge is dominant ) . table . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : table - of - quantities ] shows the values used in our calculation and the results for the energy gap and @xmath26 . from the above result _ _ _ _ we calculated the two - photon absorption and the nonlinear refraction and compared it to the experimentally measured values @xcite , as shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gaas - data](b ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gaas - data](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have done a similar analysis for @xmath3 and the results for the linear absorption are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : znse - data](a ) , with experimental data taken from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two - photon absorption and nonlinear refraction are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : znse - data](b ) and ( c ) respectively , with experimental values taken from @xcite . in our calculations , we have used a characteristic energy of the dc field @xmath32 in order to minimize band bending and allow comparison with the zero field case ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent agreement is indeed quite remarkable , especially when considering that the experimental absorption data for @xmath3 was taken from known values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 at room temperature @xcite , and related to the absorption coefficient through @xmath36 where @xmath37 , is the complex dielectric function .    in conclusion , we have explored some of the mathematical structures of the n - photon absorption process in the presence of a very strong dc - field . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the nonlinear absorption can be expressed as the product of an n - photon operator times the linear absorption coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this is , to our knowledge , the first time that nonlinear processes have been viewed as a consequence of a single photon process rescaled to an energy gap given by @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that because of this relation , results such as the convolution theorem , and _ kk _ can be introduced naturally . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we applied this formalism to two well known semiconductors ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and found excellent agreement with experimental measured trends </S>",
    "<S> . this approach can be of great value in predicting nonlinear properties solely from measurements of linear properties .    </S>",
