    "cold dark matter dominated structure formation predicts that small systems form first which then merge and build up larger galaxies . if star formation peaks at the epoch of galaxy assembly then the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies should be on average older than of giant galaxies",
    "however , the majority of local galaxies in the sdss show for example a trend of increasing age with mass ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) . also , distant spiral galaxies in deep exhibit an evolving slope in the metallicity  luminosity relation in the sense that smaller galaxies are brighter than the larger ones in the past for their metallicities ( kobulnicky et al",
    "this phenomenon of a mass - dependent evolution of the stellar population is often called the `` anti - hierarchical behaviour '' of the baryons or `` downsizing '' since it runs opposite to the mass assembly history of galaxies .",
    "we derive from vlt / fors spectra 78 and 52 spatially resolved rotation curves of spiral galaxies with @xmath2 drawn from the fors and william herschel deep fields and combine them with hst / acs imaging for a tully  fisher analysis ( bhm et al .",

    "a significantly ( @xmath3 ) flatter slope is found than for the local sample .",
    "whereas galaxies with small maximum rotation velocities @xmath4 are much brighter than their local counterparts , the rapid rotators show only very little evolution .",
    "if @xmath4 is taken as a measurement of total mass , this change of slope indicates a mass - dependent evolution of spiral galaxies . fitting optical / nir colors individually with a chemical enrichment code , bigger galaxies have on average higher star formation efficiencies and older mean stellar ages than smaller ones ( ferreras et al .",
