    "since two - dimensional models with a continuous global symmetry were recognized to be asymptotically free @xcite they became a famous laboratory for testing many ideas and methods before applying them to more complicated gauge theories . in this paper",
    "we follow this common way and present a method , different from the conventional perturbation theory ( pt ) , which allows to investigate these models in the weak coupling region .",
    "the conventional pt is one of the main technical tools of the modern physics . in spite of the belief of the most of community that this method gives the correct asymptotic expansion of such theories as @xmath2 qcd or @xmath0 spin systems with continuous global symmetry , the recent discussion of this problem @xcite-@xcite has shown that it is rather far from unambiguous solution",
    "indeed , for the pt to be applicable it is necessary that a system under consideration would possess a well ordered ground state . in two dimensional models , like the @xmath3-sigma models the mw theorem guarantees the absence of such a state in the thermodynamic limit ( tl ) however small",
    "coupling constant is @xcite .",
    "then , the usual argument in support of the pt is that locally the system is ordered and the pt is not supposed to be used for the calculation of long - distance observables . on the other hand",
    "it should reproduce the correct behaviour of the fixed - distance correlations as well as all thermodynamical functions which can be expressed via short - range observables .",
    "the example of @xmath4 models shows that even this is not always true @xcite , so why should one believe in correctness of the conventional pt in @xmath0 ?",
    "in fact , the only way to justify the pt is to prove that it gives the correct asymptotic expansion of nonperturbatively defined models in the tl .",
    "now , it was shown in @xcite that pt results in @xmath0 nonabelian models depend on the boundary conditions ( bc ) used to reach the tl .",
    "this result could potentially imply that the low - temperature limit and the tl do not commute in nonabelian models .",
    "actually , the main argumentation of @xcite regarding the failure of the pt expansion is based on the fact that the conventional pt is an expansion around a broken vacuum , i.e. the state which simply does not exist in the tl of @xmath0 models . according to @xcite ,",
    "the ground state of these systems can be described through special configurations  the so - called gas of superinstantons ( si ) and the correct expansion should take into account these saddle points . at the present stage it is rather unclear how one could construct an expansion in the si background .",
    "fortunately , there exists other , more eligible way to construct the low - temperature expansion which respects the mw theorem and is apriori not the expansion around the broken vacuum .",
    "we develop this method on an example of the @xmath0 @xmath5 principal chiral model whose partition function ( pf ) is given by @xmath6 , \\label{pfsun}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the invariant measure and we impose the periodic bc .",
    "the basic idea is the following .",
    "as was rigorously proven , the conventional pt gives an asymptotic expansion which is uniform in the volume for the abelian @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "one of the basic theorems which underlies the proof states that the following inequality holds in the @xmath9 @xmath1 model @xmath10 where @xmath11 is @xmath12-independent and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is an angle parametrizing the action of the @xmath1 model @xmath15 .",
    "it follows that at large @xmath12 the gibbs measure is concentrated around @xmath16 providing a possibility to construct an expansion around @xmath17 .",
    "this inequality is not true in @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit because of the mw theorem , however the authors of @xcite prove the same inequality for the link angle , i.e. @xmath18 where the expectation value refers to infinite volume limit .",
    "thus , in @xmath0 the gibbs measure at large @xmath12 is concentrated around @xmath19 and the asymptotic series can be constructed expanding the action in powers of @xmath20 .",
    "in the abelian case such an expansion is equivalent to the expansion around @xmath17 because i ) the action depends only on the difference @xmath21 and ii ) the integration measure is flat , @xmath22 .    in @xmath0",
    "nonabelian models , again because of the mw theorem , one has to expect in the tl something alike to ( [ ineq2d ] ) , namely @xmath23 despite there is not a rigorous proof of ( [ nabineq2d ] ) , that such ( or similar ) inequality holds in @xmath0 nonabelian models is intuitively clear and should follow from the chessboard estimates @xcite and from the dobrushin - shlosman proof of the mw theorem @xcite which shows that spin configurations are distributed uniformly in the group space in the tl .",
    "namely , the probability @xmath24 that @xmath25 is bounded by @xmath26 if the volume is sufficiently large , @xmath27 is a constant .",
    "thus , until @xmath28 is not satisfied , all configurations are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that the gibbs measure at large @xmath12 is concentrated around @xmath29 , therefore ( [ nabineq2d ] ) or its analog holds .",
    "in what follows it is assumed that ( [ nabineq2d ] ) is correct , hence @xmath30 is the only saddle point for the invariant integrals ) .",
    "what is important in ( [ nabineq2d ] ) is a factor @xmath31 , otherwise the very possibility of the expansion in @xmath32 becomes problematic . ] .",
    "thus , the correct asymptotic expansion , if exists , should be given via an expansion around @xmath30 , similarly to the abelian model .",
    "if the conventional pt gives the correct asymptotics , it must reproduce the series obtained expanding around @xmath30 .",
    "however , neither i ) nor ii ) holds in the nonabelian models , therefore it is far from obvious that two expansions indeed coincide .",
    "let us parametrize @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "consider the following expansion @xmath35",
    "\\sim   i + \\sum_{n=1}\\frac{1}{(\\beta)^{n/2}}\\frac{(i\\omega_l)^n}{n ! } \\ . \\label{ltexp}\\ ] ] the standard pt states that to calculate the asymptotic expansion one has to re - expand this series as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are to be calculated from the definition @xmath38 .",
    "this is presumably true in a finite volume where one can fix appropriate bc ( like the dirichlet ones ) , or to break down the global symmetry by fixing the global gauge ( on the periodic lattice ) .",
    "then , making @xmath12 sufficiently large one forces all the spin matrices to fluctuate around @xmath39 , therefore the substitution ( [ ltosres ] ) is justified .",
    "we do not see how this procedure could be justified when the volume increases and fluctuations of @xmath40 spread up over the whole group space .",
    "in other words , it is not clear why in the series @xmath41 the term @xmath42 is suppressed as @xmath43 relatively to the term @xmath37 .",
    "it is only ( [ ltexp ] ) which remains correct in the large volume limit and takes into account all the fluctuations contributing at a given order of the low - temperature expansion .",
    "it is a purpose of the present paper to develop an expansion around @xmath30 aiming to calculate the asymptotic series for nonabelian models .",
    "first of all , one has to give a precise mathematical meaning to the expansion ( [ ltexp ] ) .",
    "it is done in the next section .",
    "to construct an expansion of the gibbs measure and the correlation functions using ( [ ltexp ] ) we use the so - called link representation for the partition and correlation functions .",

    "obviously , it does not depend on the path @xmath64 which can be deformed for example to the shortest path between sites @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    in this representation",
    "the series ( [ ltexp ] ) acquires a well defined meaning , therefore the expansion of the action , of the invariant measure , etc . can be done .",
    "in this section we prove that for the abelian xy model the large-@xmath12 expansion in the link representation gives the same results as the conventional pt in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we consider only the free energy but the generalization for the correlation functions is straightforward .",
    "the first step is a standard one , i.e. we rescale @xmath73 and make an expansion @xmath74 = \\exp   \\left [ \\beta -\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi)^2 \\right ]   \\left [ 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty } ( \\beta)^{-k }   \\sum_{l_1, .. ,l_k}\\frac{a_1^{l_1} ...",

    "for example , the first order coefficient of the free energy being expressed in @xmath89 reads @xmath90 let us add some comments . in the standard expansion to avoid the zero mode problem one has to fix appropriate bc , like dirichlet ones or to fix a global gauge if one works on the periodic lattice @xcite . in the present scheme the zero mode decouples automatically due to using @xmath91 delta - function which takes into account the periodicity of the integrand in link angles .",
    "more important observation is that it is allowed to take the tl already in the formula ( [ asxygll ] ) : since the generating functional depends only on the link green function which is infrared finite , the uniformity of the expansion in the volume follows immediately .",

    "it is well known for a long time that it is no so in one - dimensional non - abelian models . in @xcite we address this question in the link formulation and show that non - uniformity in this case originates from the expansion of holonomy operator which imposes certain global condition on the configurations of link matrices .",

    "there are two such operators which we did not consider in the present paper .",
