    "the electromagnetic form factors of a nucleon provide information on its internal momentum space distribution of charge and magnetization , thus furnishing a unique window into the quark and gluon substructure of the nucleon .",
    "building a bridge between qcd and the observed nucleon properties is a key challenge for modern hadron physics and recent form factor measurements , for example , demonstrate that a robust understanding of nucleon properties founded in qcd is just beginning .",
    "a key example of the impact of such measurements is provided by the polarization transfer experiments  @xcite , which revealed that the ratio of the proton s electric to magnetic sachs form factors , @xmath6 , is not constant but instead decreases almost linearly with @xmath7 .",
    "these experiments dispelled decades of perceived wisdom which perpetuated the view that the nucleon contained similar distributions of charge and magnetization .",
    "nucleon form factor data at large @xmath7 can also be used to test the scaling behaviour predicted by perturbative qcd , which , for example , makes the prediction that @xmath8 should tend to a constant as @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "however , recent data extending to @xmath10gev@xmath3  @xcite , find scaling behaviour much closer to @xmath11 , which has been attributed to the quark component of the nucleon wave function possessing sizeable orbital angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "an interesting recent example , which demonstrates that there is much of a fundamental nature still to learn in hadron physics , involves the muonic hydrogen experiments  @xcite that found a proton charge radius some 4% smaller than that measured in elastic electron scattering or electronic hydrogen , representing a 7@xmath12 discrepancy . as",
    "yet there is no accepted resolution to this puzzle  @xcite .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that a quantitative theoretical understanding of nucleon form factors in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd , namely the quarks and gluons , remains an important goal .",
    "this task is particularly challenging because nucleon form factors parameterize the amplitude for a nucleon to interact through a current and remain a nucleon , for arbitrary space - like momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , long distance non - perturbative effects associated with quark binding and confinement must play an important role at all @xmath7 , while , because of asymptotic freedom at short distances , perturbative qcd must also be relevant at large momentum transfer .",
    "this scenario is somewhat in contrast to that found with the structure functions measured in deep inelastic scattering , which can be factorized into short distance wilson coefficients , calculable in perturbative qcd , and the long distance parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) which encode non - perturbative information on the structure of the bound state .",
    "a consequence of factorization is that once the pdfs are known at a scale @xmath13 , the @xmath7 evolution of the pdfs , on the bjorken @xmath14 domain relevant to hadron structure , is governed by the dglap evolution equations  @xcite .",
    "an analogous factorization is not possible for the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "here we investigate the nucleon electromagnetic form factors using the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , which is a poincar covariant quantum field theory with many of the same low - energy properties as qcd .",
    "for example , it encapsulates the key emergent phenomena of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .. ] this model also has the same flavour symmetries as qcd and should therefore provide a robust chiral effective theory of qcd valid at low to intermediate energies .",
    "the njl model is solved non - perturbatively , using the standard leading order truncation . finally , in order to respect chiral symmetry effectively",

    "[ sec : qpv ] .",

    "a salient feature of the model is that it is a poincar covariant quantum field theory where interactions dynamically break chiral symmetry , giving rise to dynamically generated dressed quark masses , a pion that is a @xmath16 bound state with the properties of a pseudo - goldstone boson and a large mass splitting between low lying chiral partners .",
