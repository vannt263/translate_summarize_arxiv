    "despite considerable effort , an unequivocal direct detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) is yet to be achieved .",
    "the expected wave strain is several orders of magnitude weaker than the sensitivity of current interferometric detectors@xcite .",
    "one possibility is to coherently integrate the signal of a continuous source . in this case , the signal - to - noise ratio increases with the square root of the observation time@xcite .",
    "a variety of physical mechanisms for the generation of continuous gravitational waves have been proposed@xcite , among them nonaxisymmetric distortions of the neutron star crust , either due to temperature variations@xcite or strong magnetic fields@xcite , r - mode instabilities @xcite , or free precession @xcite .",
    "a promising gw source was recently suggested by two of us@xcite .",
    "matter accreting onto a neutron star in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) accumulates at the magnetic poles until the latitudinal pressure gradient overcomes the magnetic tension and the plasma spreads equatorwards .",
    "the frozen - in magnetic field is carried along with the spreading matter , and is therefore compressed , until the magnetic tension is again able to counterbalance the thermal pressure .",
    "this configuration is termed a magnetic mountain@xcite . during this process",
    ", the magnetic dipole moment decreases with accreted mass , consistent with observational data.@xcite    we examine the prospect of detection of gw from magnetic mountains in section [ sec : gr ] . in section [ sec : st ] , we present preliminary results from fully three - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations to test the mountains stability .",
    "a typical mountain with @xmath0 and pre - accretion dipolar magnetic field of @xmath1 g can provide@xcite a gravitational ellipticity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the principal moments of inerta .",
    "@xmath5 is considerably higher than the deformation a conventional neutron star could sustain ( @xmath6 ) via its free elastic response and is only surpassed by exotic solid strange stars@xcite ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the characteristic gw strain@xcite is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 g @xmath10 is the principal moment of inertia , @xmath11 the spin frequency , and @xmath12 the distance to the object .",
    "[ fig ] ( left ) shows @xmath13 as a function of @xmath11 at a distance of @xmath14kpc and a mountain mass of @xmath15 together with the design sensitivities of ligo and advanced ligo for a coherent integration time of @xmath16 s. a mountain with @xmath17 should be detectable by ligo for @xmath18 hz .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed cutoff at @xmath19 hz in the spin frequency distribution of lmxbs  much slower than the breakup frequency@xcite .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )",
    "surprisingly , the distorted magnetic configuration is stable to axisymmetric modes@xcite .",
    "however , the full three - dimensional stability is yet to be examined .",
    "we perform three - dimensional simulations by loading the axisymmetric configuration into the ideal mhd - code zeus - mp .",
    "a preliminary result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig ] ( right ) .",
    "shown is the time evolution of the three cartesian quadrupole moments @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the density .",
    "after readjusting initially , the system settles down into a state that still has a sizeable quadrupole moment .",
    "furthermore , the small magnitude of the off - diagonal element @xmath21 suggests that the mountain is still nearly ( within @xmath241 % ) symmetric about the magnetic axis .",
    "we tentatively interpret these results as a preliminary proof of three - dimensional stability .",
    "however , the influence of resistivity still needs to be examined .",
    "resistive ballooning and resistive rayleigh - taylor modes may allow plasma slippage on a short timescale@xcite .",
    "non - ideal mhd simulations to investigate these effects are currently under way ."
