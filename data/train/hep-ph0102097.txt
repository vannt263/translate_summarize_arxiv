    "with the advent of colliders in the tev regime there has been a renewed interest in the high energy predictions of the standard model ( sm ) . at hadronic colliders",
    "the experimental and/or theoretical accuracy is usually in the few percent regime , and thus the effect of one loop electroweak corrections of the order of @xmath4 at tev energies is indeed relevant for many processes .",
    "the reason for these large corrections to physical cross sections is primarily that they depend on the infrared cutoff , i.e. the gauge boson masses ( @xmath1 ) , leading to large dl and sl corrections of the scale ratio @xmath2 .",
    "only soft photon effects need to be considered in a semi - inclusive way but even fully inclusive cross sections are expected to depend on @xmath5 terms @xcite due to the fact that the initial states carry a non - abelian group charge ( the weak isospin ) and thus violate the bloch - nordsieck theorem .    at this point",
    "all experimental constraints indicate that a light higgs particle below the @xmath6 threshold is responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "if this scenario is realized in nature new physics is generally expected around the tev scale in order to avoid the hierarchy problem .",
    "the high precision measurements of slc / lep have limited the room for extensions of the sm considerably and in general , they can not deviate from the sm to a large extent without evoking so - called conspiracy effects .",
    "it would therefore be very desirable to have a leptonic collider at hand in the future in order to answer questions posed by discoveries made at the lhc and possibly the tevatron .",
    "in particular , if only a light higgs is discovered , say at 115 gev , then it is mandatory to investigate all its properties in detail to experimentally establish the higgs mechanism including a possible reconstruction of the potential and of course of the yukawa couplings .",
    "in addition one would have to look for additional heavy higgs - bosons which could easily escape detection at the hadronic machines , but have a better chance for instance at the @xmath7-option at tesla @xcite .",
    "if any supersymmetric particle would be found in addition , it is necessary to clarify and/or test the relations between couplings and properties of all new particles in as much detail as possible in a complementary way to what would already be known by that time .",
    "the overall importance of leptonic colliders would thus be to clarify the physics responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking which in turn means it must be a high precision machine .",
    "on the theory side this means that effects at the 1 % level should be under control in both the sm as well as all extensions that are viable at that point .",
    "the focus of the present work is the former .",
    "in particular the abovementioned large dl and sl corrections in the sm can , at two loops , be of the order of a few % .",
    "the largest contribution in the high energy limit , the dl corrections , were treated comprehensively to all orders in ref .",
    "the method employed in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a non - abelian generalization of a bremsstrahlung theorem due to gribov @xcite .",
    "the essential point here is that corrections factorize with respect to the perpendicular sudakov component @xmath8 of the exchanged gauge boson . with a cutoff imposed on the allowed values of @xmath9 all gauge bosons in the unbroken ( high energy )",
    "regime of the electroweak theory factorize according to the underlying @xmath10 symmetry in analogy to qcd .",
    "the effect of soft photon emission can then be included in the framework of the iree method @xcite with appropriate matching conditions .",
    "this approach was extended to the subleading level and to longitudinal degrees of freedom via the equivalence theorem in refs .",
    "@xcite by employing the virtual contributions to the respective splitting functions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was furthermore shown that also top - yukawa enhanced subleading corrections can be included in this formalism to sl accuracy to all orders .",
    "these terms are typical for broken gauge theories as are longitudinal degrees of freedom in general .    at one loop , the approach was tested with calculations in the physical sm fields of refs . @xcite . also at the two loop level to dl accuracy ,",
    "the approach was verified by explicit calculations in refs . @xcite . to subleading accuracy",
    "it agrees with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath11 to all orders ( up to yukawa terms ) , where results for the qcd form factor were generalized to the electroweak theory in a similar spirit as detailed above .",
    "in addition , non - universal angular terms were calculated at the one loop level and it was proposed to resum these terms by multiplying these corrections with the dl form factor .",
    "the still outstanding corrections of the universal , i.e. process independent , type are the focus of this work .",
    "they are given by the folding of dl - corrections with rg loops at higher orders , starting at the two loop level .",
    "these contributions are of order @xmath3 and as such need to be included in a genuinely sl analysis .",
    "we will denote them as sl - rg in the following .",
    "conventional rg corrections , however , are subsubleading at the two loop level .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : qcd ] we review the case for unbroken gauge theories and focus on qcd in particular .",
    "we derive analytical formulas for both virtual and real corrections to external quark and gluon lines depending on the experimental requirements .",
    "section [ sec : sm ] then applies the results according to the above considerations to the sm after briefly summarizing the results for the sudakov corrections .",
    "we discuss the size of the results in section [ sec : dis ] and make concluding remarks in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "in this section we review the case of unbroken gauge theories like qcd .",
    "explicit comparisons with higher order calculations revealed that the relevant rg scale in the respective diagrams is indeed the perpendicular sudakov component @xcite .",
    "we give correction factors for each external line below .",
    "the universal nature of the higher order sl - rg corrections can be seen as follows .",
    "consider the gauge invariant fermionic part ( @xmath12 ) as indicative of the full @xmath13 term ( replacing @xmath14 ) . in order to lead to subleading ,",
    "i.e. @xmath15 , this loop correction must be folded with the exchange of a gauge boson between two external lines ( producing a dl type contribution ) like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : slrg ] . using the conservation of the total non - abelian group charge , i.e. @xmath16 the double sum over all external insertions @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 is reduced to a single sum over all @xmath19 external legs .",
    "thus these types of corrections can be identified with external lines at higher orders .",
    "the same conclusion is reproduced by the explicit pole structure of @xmath20 renormalized scattering amplitudes at the two loop level in qcd @xcite .",
    "in addition , from the expression in ref . @xcite it can be seen that the sl - rg corrections are independent of the spin , i.e. for both quarks and gluons the same running coupling argument is to be used .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that these corrections appear only in loops which can yield dl corrections on the lower order level and as such , the available dl phase space is identical up to group theory factors .",
    "we begin with the virtual case .",
    "the case of virtual sl - rg corrections for both massless and massive partons has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with a different sudakov parametrization .",
    "below we show the identity of both approaches .",
    "the form of the corrections is given in terms of the probabilities @xmath21 .",
    "to logarithmic accuracy , they correspond to the probability to emit a soft and/or collinear virtual parton from particle @xmath22 at high energies subject to an infrared cutoff @xmath23 . at the amplitude level",
    "all expressions below are universal for each external line and exponentiate according to @xmath24 where @xmath19 denotes the number of external lines .",
    "we begin with the massless case .      in the following",
    "we denote the running qcd - coupling by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and for qcd we have @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 as usual .",
    "up to two loops the massless @xmath30-function is independent of the chosen renormalization scheme and is gauge invariant in minimally subtracted schemes to all orders @xcite .",
    "these features will also hold for the derived renormalization group correction factors below in the high energy regime .",
    "the scale @xmath23 denotes the infrared cutoff on the exchanged @xmath31 between the external momenta @xmath32 , where the sudakov decomposition is given by @xmath33 , such that @xmath34 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath23 serves as a a lower limit on the exchanged euclidean component @xmath35 which can be defined in an invariant way as : @xmath36 for all @xmath37 . in order to avoid the landau pole we must choose @xmath38",
    "thus , the expressions given in this section correspond for quarks to the case where @xmath39 . for arbitrary external lines",
    "we then have @xmath40 the rg correction is then described by including the effect of the running coupling from the scale @xmath41 to @xmath42 according to @xcite ( see also discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 for gluons and @xmath45 for quarks . for completeness",
    "we also give the subleading terms of the external line correction which is of course also important for phenomenological applications .",
    "the terms depend on the external line and the complete result to logarithmic accuracy is given by : @xmath46 it should be noted that the subleading term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gvrgex ] ) proportional to @xmath47 is not a conventional renormalization group corrections but rather an anomalous scaling dimension , and enters with the opposite sign @xcite compared to the conventional rg contribution .",
    "here we give results for the case when the infrared cutoff @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the external quark mass .",
    "we begin with the case of equal external and internal line masses :      following ref .",

    "these corrections are thus considerably smaller and only needed if precisions below the one percent level are necessary from the theory side . for right handed top quarks",
    "the effect is even smaller since only the running of @xmath160 enters and it is thus negligible for most applications .",
    "the form of the two curves in case of right handed tops differs markedly from the other three cases because at the energies displayed , the dominant effect is actually due to subleading yukawa enhanced corrections ( @xmath161 ) since the dl terms are proportional to @xmath160 and since the ratio @xmath162 is of the size of an additional logarithm for these values of @xmath0 .",
    "in general it can be seen that - where the dl terms dominate - the renormalization group improved results are indeed in - between the upper and lower bounds given by the respective scale choices in the conventional sudakov form factors . indeed also for right handed top quarks this pattern is observed if only dl corrections are taken into account .",
    "it should be emphasized again that also the qed - rg corrections can be sizable since large mass ratios with light particles occur .",
    "these should of course also be implemented in a full sm prediction at tev energies .",
    "in this paper we have obtained the complete subleading electroweak renormalization group corrections to all orders in high energy processes in the framework of the infrared evolution equation ( iree ) method .",
    "these are terms originating in loops which at a lower loop order lead to dl corrections and are of the type @xmath163 .",
    "we have derived the corrections for massless as well as massive gauge theories and used appropriate matching conditions to obtain the full sm contributions .",
    "these corrections start at the two loop level and are universal , i.e. properties of external lines and thus process independent .",
    "they represent the last missing universal contribution needed for a full sl - analysis at the two loop level .",
    "the size of the effect at tev energies is in general a fraction of one percent and is largest in the scalar and gauge boson sector , where at 2 tev the uncertainty in the conventional sudakov form factor is about 0.6% per line at the level of the cross section .",
    "these effects can not be neglected at tev linear colliders for precision measurements in the percentile regime .",
    "the last outstanding type of sl - correction at the two loop level is given by the non - universal , process dependent angular terms of the type @xmath164 .",
    "these terms also do nt factorize with respect to the born cross amplitude and the high precision objectives of future linear colliders will make at least a two loop analysis of these corrections mandatory .",
