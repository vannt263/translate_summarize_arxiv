    "@xmath2 decay is a magnetic dipole radiative transition with photon energy @xmath8 about 114 mev , and a relatively large branching fraction of about 2% .",
    "this is a transition between 1@xmath9 states of charmonium and its rate can be easily calculated in potential models .",
    "the transition does not change a spatial part of the wave function and its matrix element in the leading approximation equals one . a simple calculation without relativistic corrections",
    "gives the result@xcite @xmath10 .",
    "it was expected that relativistic corrections are of order 20 - 30% , similarly to the case of the electric dipole transitions in charmonium .",
    "therefore , it was surprising when in 1986 the crystal ball collaboration measured this branching fraction in the inclusive photon spectrum and obtained @xmath11@xcite .",
    "there are a lot of theoretical predictions for this decay rate@xcite@xmath12@xcite , based on qcd sum rules , lattice qcd calculations and so on , but as a rule they give values approximately twice as large as the crystal ball result .",
    "this puzzle remained for more than twenty years . only in 2009 the cleo collaboration published@xcite the result of a new measurement of this branching fraction using analysis of 12 exclusive decay modes of @xmath3 .",
    "the obtained value @xmath13 is closer to theory . combining the crystal ball and cleo results ,",
    "pdg@xcite got @xmath14 with a scale factor of 1.6 . in this work",
    "we report a result of the new independent measurement .",
    "the photon spectrum in @xmath15 decay can be written as@xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the matrix element of the transition , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are c - quark charge ( in electron charge units ) and mass while @xmath21 is a breit - wigner function taking into account a nonzero @xmath3 width .",
    "the matrix element tends to unity when @xmath8 tends to zero and decreases slowly with the photon energy increase .",
    "cleo found that the photon line shape of this transition is asymmetric , and a breit - wigner function alone provides a poor fit to data .",
    "its modification with @xmath22 improves the fit around the peak , but gives a diverging tail at higher photon energies . to suppress this tail , cleo used in their fit @xmath23 with @xmath24 mev , explaining it by the overlap of the ground state wave functions",
    "however , such a form of the matrix element is valid for the wave functions of the harmonic oscillator only . in all other potentials ,",
    "@xmath25 dependence will be proportional to some negative degree of @xmath8 when @xmath8 tends to infinity .",
    "we tried to fit the cleo data using another line shape : at photon energy @xmath8 near the resonance the decay probability @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath27 , but at higher energies the factor @xmath22 is replaced with @xmath8 .",
    "we found that the function @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , is also suitable . here",
    "the correction factor @xmath30 is a smooth function near the resonance .",
    "results of fits with the cleo function and our function are shown in table  [ ta1 ] .",
    "one can see that results on the @xmath3 mass , width , and decay rate are close , and the confidence level of the fit with our function is also good .",
    "therefore , we use the latter function in the analysis of our data .",
    "the experiment was performed at the kedr detector@xcite of the vepp-4 m collider@xcite .",
    "the collider operates with a peak luminosity of about @xmath31 @xmath32 near the @xmath0 peak energy .",
    "luminosity is measured with single bremsstrahlung online and with small - angle bhabha scattering offline .",
    "two methods of beam energy determination are used : resonant depolarization with accuracy of @xmath33 kev and ir - light compton backscattering with accuracy @xmath34 kev@xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on a data sample of @xmath35 @xmath36 collected at the @xmath0 peak .",
    "three @xmath0 scans were performed . using a measured beam energy spread as well as known@xcite @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0 production cross section at the peak and get @xmath39 .",
    "event selection was performed in two steps . at the first step ,",
    "multihadron decays of @xmath0 were selected with the following cuts : total energy in the calorimeters is greater than 0.8 gev ; at least four clusters with the energy greater than 30 mev in the calorimeters are detected ; at least one central track in the drift chamber is reconstructed ; there are no muon tubes activated in the third layer of the muon system .",
    "these cuts suppress background from the cosmic rays , beam - gas interactions and bhabha events . at the second step",
    ", photons in these events were identified .",
    "a photon is a cluster in the liquid krypton calorimeter which is not associated with the reconstructed tracks in the drift chamber and has no time - of - flight ( tof ) scintillation counters activated in front of it .",
    "according to the simulation , the photon detection efficiency with the above mentioned cuts is about 28% and is almost constant in the investigated range of the photon energies .",
    "the inclusive photon spectrum and a fit to our data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the spectrum was fit with a sum of the signal having a shape @xmath40 , convolved with the calorimeter response function ( logarithmic normal distribution@xcite with @xmath41 mev at 110 mev and a=-0.33 ) , and background .",
    "the background shape was taken in the form @xmath42 , where the first term describes `` fake '' photons appearing due to nuclear interactions of hadrons in the calorimeter and usually having energies less than 60 mev , the second term is the second - order polynomial describing photons arising mainly from @xmath43 decays , and @xmath44 is the spectrum of charged particles ( a charged particle can be also misidentified as a photon ) .",
    "the breit - wigner function of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , was used in the fit .",
    "we also tried to fit our data using other line shapes .",
    "we used @xmath21 alone , @xmath47 , the cleo function , and our function . again , as first noted by cleo , we found that the @xmath21 function alone gives a shifted value of @xmath3 mass compared to other functions : @xmath48 mev/@xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath27 leads to a large tail at higher photon energies , giving for the branching fraction @xmath49 ( here the decay probability function was integrated up to @xmath50 ) .",
    "the last two functions give close fit results .",
    "since the cleo function has an exponential factor , the result for the branching fraction with this function can be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the difference between the results obtained with the two last functions is used to estimate a systematic error appearing due to the unknown line shape .",
    "systematic errors of our measurements are listed in table  [ ta3 ] .",
    "the uncertainty of the @xmath3 width leads to an error , which we evaluated varying the @xmath3 width in the fit by 2.2 mev ( the current pdg error ) . a systematic error related to the background subtraction",
    "was estimated by using in the fit a polynomial of the third order instead of the second - order one , varying ranges of the fit , and applying or not the tof veto in photon selection .",
    "the error in the number of @xmath0 produced was evaluated using the known uncertainty of the luminosity measurement .",
    "since the cluster multiplicity is different in the simulation and experimental photon spectrum in @xmath0 decays , the error due to the photon detection efficiency was estimated by changing by 25% weights of events with small @xmath51 and large @xmath52 track multiplicities , and taking different mc generators for the @xmath3 decays .",
    "the calibration of the photon energy scale was performed using @xmath53 decays and @xmath54 transitions .",
    "a new direct measurement of @xmath2 decay was performed .",
    "we measured the @xmath3 mass , width , and branching fraction of @xmath2 decay .",
    "the values of the branching fraction and @xmath3 mass are sensitive to the line shape of the photon spectrum and it should be taken into account during analysis .",
    "our results on the @xmath3 mass and width are :        before our experiment these parameters were measured in @xmath0 and @xmath57 meson decays , as well as in @xmath58 and @xmath59 collisions .",
    "measurements of crystal ball , mark3 , bes , and kedr were performed using the radiative @xmath0 decays , therefore , a mass shift should be taken into account .",
    "crystal ball and kedr made such a correction , but mark3 and bes did not .",
    "therefore we believe that mark3 and bes results on the @xmath3 mass should be corrected by approximately 4 mev towards higher values .",
