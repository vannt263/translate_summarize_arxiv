    "it has been known for many years @xcite that next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) for cross sections of various hard scattering processes , lead to functions singular at the edge of the relevant phase space .",
    "for example , for drell - yan ( dy ) process we define @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the invariant mass of the produced lepton pair squared and @xmath3 is the total partonic invariant mass squared . at @xmath4 order in pqcd",
    "we encounter terms like @xmath5 $ ] . in the limit",
    "@xmath6 these singular functions ",
    "when mellin transformed  give rise to large double logarithms in moment space @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 is large , the product of these large logarithms with a small coupling constant @xmath9 is not necessarily small and an all - order resummation in perturbation theory is needed to make predictions reliable .",
    "the purpose of a resummation is to control these large logarithms and to obtain a closed expression that sums part or all of these logarithms . for dy and deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes ,",
    "an extensive theoretical work was performed in refs.@xcite , according to which , one has to establish first a factorized form of the cross section into a hard part ( `` wilson coefficient '' ) , jet part and soft part , and then make a clever use of an evolution in parton rapidity .",
    "we will have more to say about this in section iv .",
    "recently an effective field theory approach was implemented @xcite to re - sum leading logs ( ll ) and next - to - leading logs ( nll ) for dis at large momentum transfer and near the threshold limit @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the longitudinal hadron momentum fraction carried by the quark ) .",
    "that analysis was performed within the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) framework @xcite . by utilizing this effective theory for the inclusive dis ( for large momentum transfer and near threshold ) cross sections",
    ", one can re - derives the full qcd results ( as a consistency check of the effective theory ! ) more importantly , the exponentiation of the ll and nll in moment space appears quite naturally in this context following the solution of a simple rg equation @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the application of scet to the dy cross section in the threshold limit @xmath6 and show how the resummation is obtained .",
    "we work in the center - of - mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "frame of the incoming quark and anti - quark , and identify three relevant scales : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the threshold limit",
    "we have @xmath15 .",
    "assuming @xmath16 , we have a clear separation of scales .",
    "given these three scales one has to perform a two stage matching and running : first , at @xmath2 we match the full qcd ( annihilation ) current onto the scet current , giving rise the so - called scet@xmath17 in which virtuality of order @xmath2 is integrated out .",
    "then we match , at the intermediate scale @xmath13 , the scet dy cross section onto a product of scet parton distribution functions ( pdf ) @xcite , giving rise to scet@xmath18 in which virtuality or order @xmath13 is integrated out . here",
    "we assume that the usoft interactions cancel as in the standard drell - yan factorization which is valid in the kinematic region of our interest @xcite .",
    "the second matching yields the infrared - safe hard scattering coefficient function .",
    "then , the pdf will run down in scale and be matched onto local twist - two operators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give the basic notation , definitions and power counting of scet . in section",
    "iii we perform the two - stage matching and write down the anomalous dimensions .",
    "we compare our results for dy ( as well as those of dis ) with the full qcd calculations . in section",
    "iv we derive the resummation ( and exponentiation ) of the large logs and compare our results with those given in @xcite .",
    "we conclude the paper in section v.",
    "soft - collinear effective field theory was invented to handle processes with multiple momentum scales @xcite .",
    "this is the case in dy and dis when final - state hadrons have an invariant mass much greater than @xmath19 but much smaller than the highest momentum scale of the problem . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe some of the concepts and notations in scet .",
    "we choose @xmath20 for a generic four - vector @xmath21 let @xmath22 and write @xmath23",
    ". then @xmath24 with this notation one has to trivially modify the scet feynman rules given in @xcite .",
    "scet describes the interaction of `` collinear '' quarks with `` collinear '' and/or `` soft '' gluons .",
    "if we have a fast - moving quark or gluon in the @xmath25-direction then we assign to its momentum components the following scaling : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is some relevant hard scale and @xmath28 is a small parameter identified by considering the different momentum scales available .",
    "a quark with such an assignment is called @xmath25-collinear and is described by @xmath29 field and @xmath25-collinear gluon has @xmath30 field .",
    "similarly , for @xmath31-collinear quark field we assign @xmath32 and is described by @xmath33 field . for the dy case , and in the c.o.m .",
    "frame , we let the incoming quark be moving in the @xmath34 direction ( i.e @xmath35 is `` large '' ) and the incoming anti - quark moving in the @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath37 is `` large '' ) ; then these fields are described by @xmath33 and @xmath29 respectively . at the scale @xmath27 , after integrating out virtuality of order @xmath2 , the electromagnetic current in scet@xmath17 is given by @xmath38 the coefficient @xmath39 has been calculated in @xcite and will be presented in the next section .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the familiar path - ordered wilson lines and are required to insure collinear gauge invariance of the current operator @xcite .",

    "in this work we use the feynman gauge and the @xmath49 scheme in @xmath50 .",
    "we will also use on - shell dimensional regularization ( dr ) to regulate both the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) divergences .",
    "the choice of ir regulator in scet is a delicate matter @xcite , and one has to make sure that the ir regulator accurately generates the ir behavior of the full theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , quark off - shellness was used as ir regulator , however all the results can also be obtained by using pure on - shell dr .",
    "this was checked explicitly .",
    "we will also follow the normalization conventions for the dy and dis cross sections given in @xcite .",

    ", we re - derive the known one - loop coefficient function in scet . to make the discussion",
    "self - contained , we first review the result for dis process @xcite .",
    "since the dy and dis processes are related to each other , let us review , briefly , how the analysis for dis in scet was performed .",
    "choosing the breit frame , let the incoming quark be @xmath45-collinear , ( i.e. moving in the @xmath34 with large @xmath35 and small @xmath53 ) and the outgoing quark be @xmath25-collinear , and let @xmath54 .",
    "the invariant mass of the final hadronic state for dis in the limit @xmath10 is : @xmath55 .",

    "this is done by matching a product of scet@xmath17 currents onto an effective theory ( scet@xmath18 ) where the @xmath25-collinear quark is `` replaced '' by a soft wilson line , thus one is led to the matrix element of scet@xmath18 quark operator given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) between quark states .",
    "this is very much like the standard operator product expansion .",
    "if one computes the matching condition at @xmath69 by using pure on - shell dr , then one has to consider only the contribution of feynman diagrams where a real gluon is emitted into the final state , because the one - loop virtual diagrams are scaleless and thus vanish .",
