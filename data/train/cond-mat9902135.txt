    "<S> recently , lenski et al have carried out an experiment on bacterial evolution . </S>",
    "<S> their findings support the theory of punctuated equilibrium in biological evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the m=2 bak - sneppen model can explain some of the experimental results in a qualitative manner .    </S>",
    "<S> * punctuated equilibrium in an evolving bacterial population * indranath chaudhuri and indrani bose + department of physics , + bose institute , + 93/1 , acharya prafulla chandra road , + calcutta-700 009 , india .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two major schools of thought in evolutionary biology : gradualism which implies continuous evolutionary changes and the theory of punctuated equilibrium ( pe ) which states that evolutionary activity occurs in bursts . </S>",
    "<S> long periods of ` stasis ' are followed by short periods of rapid changes . </S>",
    "<S> recent exhaustive studies of fossil beds lend support to the second theory @xcite . in a remarkable but controversial experiment , </S>",
    "<S> lenski et al @xcite studied an evolving bacterial population for approximately 10,000 generations . </S>",
    "<S> they inoculated a flask of low sugar broth with a dollop of bacteria . at the end of a day , a bit of the bacterial broth was siphoned into a fresh flask of food to keep the cells growing and dividing . </S>",
    "<S> every 15 days , a sample bacterial population was frozen for later analysis . after four years </S>",
    "<S> , data for 10,000 generations were available . </S>",
    "<S> lenski et al found evidence of pe when they measured the average cell size every 100 generations . </S>",
    "<S> the relative fitness , a measure of the increase in the growth rate of the descendant population over that of the ancestral population , also increases in a step - like manner . </S>",
    "<S> further , the average cell size and the mean fitness appear to be correlated .    </S>",
    "<S> lenski et al have interpreted the experimental results as suggesting that natural selection of rare beneficial mutations may be responsible for the punctuated growths seen in their experiments . during the periods of stasis , the bacteria are in a sense waiting for the beneficial mutations to occur . the rate of evolution is limited by the availability of such mutations . </S>",
    "<S> the bacterial ( e. coli ) population was allowed to develop from a single cell of a strain that can not exchange dna . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous mutations are thus the only source of genetic change in the population . the experiment also involved competition for food because of the low availability of sugar . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a selection pressure on the bacterial population . </S>",
    "<S> there is a possibility that natural selection favours large cells as they have more energy reserve . </S>",
    "<S> the extra biomass can lead to faster replication than in the case of smaller cells . on the other hand , large cell size </S>",
    "<S> may simply be correlated with other traits which are the targets of natural selection and which are responsible for faster growth of the bacterial population .    </S>",
    "<S> bak and sneppen ( bs ) @xcite have earlier proposed a model of biological evolution which exhibits pe in evolutionary activity in the so - called self - organised critical ( soc ) state . </S>",
    "<S> there is a modified version of the bs model known as the m - trait bs model @xcite in which several biological species are considered , each of which is characterised by m traits , instead of just one trait ( fitness ) as in the original bs model . in this paper , we show that the m=2 bs model can explain the major results of lenski et al s experiment in a qualitative manner .    in the bs model , </S>",
    "<S> each site of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice represents a particular species . </S>",
    "<S> we make a slight modification to this model . we divide the bacterial population into @xmath0 categories . </S>",
    "<S> each category contains bacteria of similar characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 categories correspond to the @xmath0 sites in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> two traits , namely , cell size and fitness ( related to the replication rate ) , are associated with the population at each site . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of evolution is the same as in the m=2 bs model . </S>",
    "<S> one assigns a random number ( between 0 and 1 ) to each of the traits at all the @xmath0 sites . at each time step </S>",
    "<S> , the site with the minimum random value for a trait is identified . ` </S>",
    "<S> mutation ' occurs to bring about a change in the trait . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum random number is replaced by a new random number . </S>",
    "<S> the random numbers associated with any one of the traits of the neighbouring sites are also replaced by new numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this is to take into account the linkage of neighbouring populations in food chain . </S>",
    "<S> the last two steps are repeated and averages are taken for both the traits locally ( over 40 sites ) and globally ( over 2000 sites ) . unlike in the original bs model , we calculate quantities from the very beginning and not after the soc state is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the relative fitness ( rf ) is defined to be the ratio of current fitness and initial fitness at time t=0 . in the actual experiment , </S>",
    "<S> fitness is related to the growth rate of the bacterial population via replication . in the following , we compare the results obtained by simulation with the experimental results of lenski et al . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows rf versus time ( generations ) for both experiment and simulation . in simulation , the rf </S>",
    "<S> is calculated for the whole bacterial population by taking a global average over all sites . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the same curves but , now in the experiment , readings are taken every 100 generations , in contrast to 500 generations in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the step - like curve of the experiment is obtained in the simulation by taking a local average over 40 sites in calculating the rf . </S>",
    "<S> the data points are obtained every 100 time steps . </S>",
    "<S> figs.3 and 4 show results similar to those in figs.1 and 2 but now for the cell size ( volume ) . figs.1 and 3 show that the rf and the average cell size increase quite rapidly in the first 2000 generations in the experimental environment . </S>",
    "<S> after several thousand generations , changes are imperceptible . </S>",
    "<S> the data points in the two figures are taken every 500 generations . </S>",
    "<S> figs.2 and 4 exhibit data taken every 100 generations . </S>",
    "<S> the step - like features correspond to periods of stasis followed by short periods of rapid evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale over which data is obtained seems to be the deciding factor in the observation of pe . </S>",
    "<S> punctuation shows up only when the rf and the average cell size are measured every 100 generations . at the longer time scale of 500 generations , </S>",
    "<S> the growths appear to be smooth and gradual . </S>",
    "<S> objection has been raised @xcite that if one looks closely enough at anything , steps will eventually be seen . in the bs model , </S>",
    "<S> gradual changes are seen when global averages are taken and steps appear for local averages . </S>",
    "<S> fig.5 shows the correlation between average cell size and mean fitness for both experiment and simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation coefficients @xcite are r = 0.954 ( experiment ) , r = 0.998 ( simulation ) .    from figs . 1 - 5 </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that the experimental and simulation results are in qualitative agreement . </S>",
    "<S> many issues , however , have to be clarified before a quantitative agreement can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> as already mentioned , lenski et al have interpreted their experimental results by assuming that natural selection favours beneficial mutations which confer competitive advantage . in the bs model </S>",
    "<S> , mutations can be both beneficial and disadvantageous . in the first case , </S>",
    "<S> the smallest fitness value is replaced by a larger value . in the second case , the new fitness value is lower than the first one . </S>",
    "<S> simulation of the bs model , however , shows an overall increase of the rf ( or the cell size ) in time . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the probability of beneficial bacterial mutation is more in the bs model . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the soc state , most fitness values are above a critical threshold value . </S>",
    "<S> consider that in a particular time step , the minimal fitness value is 0.2 . </S>",
    "<S> this number is to be replaced by a random number drawn from a uniform distribution over the interval 0 - 1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the probability that the new fitness value is less than the original one is 0.2 and the probability that the fitness increases is 0.8 . over a large number of generations , the average fitness ( or the cell size ) has a tendency to increase . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of experimental and simulation results , however , shows that the cell volume , obtained from simulation , has a much smaller rate of growth than in the actual experiment . also , the number of steps in the cell size is larger than as seen in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data for the rf ( fig.2 ) show four significant steps : 0 to 200 , 300 to 500 , 600 to 1200 and 1300 to 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> the steps in the case of the cell size ( fig.4 ) occur in the regions 0 to 200 , 300 to 500 , 600 , 700 to 1100 , 1200 and 1300 to 3000 . </S>",
    "<S> thus there are only two discrepancies among the step regions in the cases of the rf and the cell size . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is more in the case of simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between simulation time steps and bacterial generations is not clear . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> about @xmath1 mutations occurred every day and there were approximately 6.6 generations per day . in the lattice model </S>",
    "<S> , the bacterial population has a coarse - grained representation . </S>",
    "<S> bacteria of similar characteristics are grouped in a single category . </S>",
    "<S> so one mutation in the lattice model is equivalent to a large number of mutations in reality . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> serial transfer of a part of the bacterial poulation to fresh sugar medium occured at the end of a day . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is not explicit in the lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> increase of the fitness parameter indicates a higher replication rate and so the population increase is taken into account in an indirect manner . </S>",
    "<S> one crucial feature of the experiment is the scarcity of food ( sugar ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , this feature is not inherent in the lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the average cell size , over time , in the lattice model can , however , be considered to be an outcome of low food supply . </S>",
    "<S> the bs model has to be suitably modified to take into account the effect of competition for food . </S>",
    "<S> also , the implication of the local versus the global average , in an actual experiment has to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> the soc state of the bs model is characterised by power - law correlations @xcite in space and time . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of the rf and the cell size , however , occur before the soc state is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the soc state corresponds to the saturation regions in the growth curves . </S>",
    "<S> bak and sneppen have shown that this state exhibits pe in the biological activity and has the characteristic that all mutations involve changing of fitness values below a self - organised critical value . </S>",
    "<S> also , the distribution of distances between successive mutations has a power - law decay as a function of the distance between the mutations . </S>",
    "<S> the size and lifetime distributions of avalanches of successive mutations have a power - law form . </S>",
    "<S> further experiments on bacterial evolution can test the validity of some of these ideas . </S>"
