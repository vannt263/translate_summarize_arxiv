    "the strong correlation between galaxy metallicity @xmath6 and galaxy luminosity @xmath7 is one of the more significant phenomenological results in galaxy chemical evolution studies .",
    "the basic correlation of o / h vs. @xmath7 was demonstrated for irregular galaxies by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended this correlation to include spiral galaxies , demonstrating that a correlation between metallicity and luminosity extends over a factor of 100 in metallicity and 11 magnitudes in blue luminosity @xmath8 .",
    "parallel studies of elliptical galaxies @xcite showed a similar metallicity - luminosity correlation .",
    "@xcite noted that both ellipticals and star - forming galaxies exhibited similar metallicity luminosity correlations , despite the different measurement techniques .",
    "this suggests that similar phenomena govern the metallicity - luminosity relationship in spiral / irregular and elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is not clear that the primary correlation in this case is between metallicity and luminosity . for disk galaxies , luminosity , rotation speed ( or total mass ) , surface brightness , and hubble type",
    "are all correlated to some degree ( roberts 1994 ; de jong & lacey 2000 ) , so it is not certain which is the main driver of the correlation .",
    "rotation speed ( @xmath0 ) , taken as the maximum measured speed or the speed on the flat part of the rotation curve , or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radius , may be preferable measures of galaxy mass , but @xcite and @xcite found that the metallicity-@xmath0 correlation was not noticeably better than the metallicity - luminosity correlation , at least for spiral galaxies .",
    "the origin of this correlation is open to debate .",
    "a metallicity - luminosity correlation can arise if smaller galaxies have larger gas fractions than larger galaxies , which is seen statistically in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this situation can arise if small galaxies either evolve more slowly ( lower star formation rate per unit mass ) or are younger on average than more massive systems , and have thus simply processed a smaller fraction of their gas into stars .",
    "the relatively blue colors of low - mass irregular galaxies indicates that this must be true at some level .",
    "on the other hand , it has been popular recently to ascribe the correlation to the effects of selective loss of heavy elements from galaxies in supernova - driven outflows .",
    "low - mass galaxies are expected to lose a larger fraction of sn ejecta than more massive systems because of their smaller gravitational potentials . however , the loss of gas from galaxies depends not just on gravitation potential , but also on the vertical structure of the ism and details of radiative losses , among other things .",
    "numerical modeling of outflows by @xcite showed that it is extremely difficult to ` blow away ' the ism of a gas - rich dwarf galaxy via starburst superwinds , although selective loss of metals may be relatively easy .",
    "however , a generalized description of the conditions for loss of metals from galaxies is not yet available .",
    "the question of loss of metals from galaxies is of high interest because of the apparently ubiquitous presence of metals in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and the intergalactic medium ( igm ; ellison et al .",
    "the source of these metals , whether from galactic outflows , tidal / ram pressure stripping in dense environments , or pre - galactic stars , is debated .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to look for evidence that galaxies are actually losing metals to the igm .",
    "i begin here by examining the @xmath7-@xmath6 correlation in a different way .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the familiar o / h - @xmath8 correlation for spiral and irregular galaxies , taking the value of o / h at the disk half - light radius @xmath11 as a surrogate for the average ism abundance in spirals ; the data used is discussed below .",
    "b - band magnitudes are often considered to be a less - than - ideal surrogate for galaxy mass , however .",
    "the blue light from galaxies can be strongly affected by interstellar extinction , and variations in recent star formation history can make the relation between stellar mass and blue luminosity uncertain , especially for bursting dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , in figure 1(b ) i plot o / h versus rotation speed @xmath0 ( obtained from rotation curves ) for the same set of galaxies ; data for this plot are listed in tables 1 - 3 .",
    "this panel shows that , interestingly , the correlation between o / h and @xmath0 does not increase steadily , but rather turns over for rotation speeds greater than 125 km s@xmath1 . above this value ,",
    "the data indicate that the mean metallicity for the most massive spirals is essentially constant .",
    "( to a large degree , this behavior becomes apparent because we have changed from a logarithmic scale [ b magnitude ] to a linear scale [ @xmath0 ] ) .",
    "this result suggests that there is a velocity / mass threshold below which the metallicity evolution of a galaxy varies according to mass .",
    "gas flows , both infall and outflow , affect the metallicity evolution of a galaxy in measurable ways .",
    "@xcite has examined the effects of such flows in the context of the closed box chemical evolution model . under the assumptions of no",
    "gas flows and instantaneous recycling of stellar ejecta , metallicity evolution in the closed box model is a simple function of the gas fraction @xmath13 and the true yield @xmath14 given by the familiar expression    @xmath15    one can write a corresponding expression for any individual element by replacing @xmath6 and @xmath14 with the appropriate quantities for individual elements .    by inverting equation ( 1 ) , one can define the effective yield @xmath3 :    @xmath16    the effective yield is thus a quantity that can be measured from the observed metallicity and gas fraction .",
    "we assume for the purposes of this work that the true yield is essentially constant .",
    "the true yield is a function of stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "massive stars ( @xmath17 @xmath18 10 @xmath19 ) account for most of the bulk nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than helium , and oxygen comprises the largest fraction of this , 45 - 60% of @xmath6 by mass .",
    "nucleosynthesis is somewhat dependent on metallicity , although the direct effects on bulk nucleosynthesis in stellar cores are relatively small ( woosley & weaver 1995 ; see fig .",
    "2.10 in matteucci 2001 ) .",
    "the largest influence of metallicity on nucleosynthesis in massive stars is the effect of radiatively - accelerated mass loss in stellar winds @xcite .",
    "stellar winds in massive stars can remove he and c that would otherwise be converted to o , thus increasing the yields of he and c and reducing the yield of o. these effects are most serious for stars more massive than 25 @xmath19 at metallicities of roughly solar and above .",
    "integrated over a @xcite imf , the net yield for o in this case declines by no more than a factor of two between @xmath6 = 0.002 and @xmath6 = 0.02 @xcite .",
    "for the no - mass - loss models of @xcite , a weak increase in the bulk yield is seen over the same range of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated in a series of theorems that one could derive a few general properties of chemical evolution in the case of outflows and inflows :    \\(1 ) in the case of pure outflows , the effective yield is always smaller than in the case of the simple model .",
    "\\(2 ) in the case of inflow of unenriched gas , the effective yield is always smaller than that in the simple model whether or not there is an outflow .",
    "\\(3 ) if the inflow is enriched , the metallicity of the infalling gas must be comparable to the metallicity of the system to significantly alter inference ( 2 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) if outflow is greater than infall , the effective yield is smaller than that of the simple model as long as the infalling gas has metallicity less than that of the system .",
    "figure 2 , adapted from figure 1 of @xcite , illustrates the situation for the case of outflows or unenriched inflows . the simple model is a straight line in the diagram",
    "whose slope is the yield .",
    "there is a region of the diagram with @xmath6 @xmath18 @xmath6(simple model ) which is forbidden to systems with outflows or unenriched inflows . in these cases",
    "the effective yield is always smaller than the true yield .",
    "thus , in the context of the simple chemical evolution model , it is possible to investigate how effective gas flows are in the metallicity evolution of galaxies .",
    "if the @xmath6-@xmath7 correlation is simply the result of variation of gas fraction along the mass sequence , then the effective yields derived for the galaxy sample should be relatively constant ( modulo the possibility of a small metallicity dependence of the true yields ) . if inflow and outflow of gas are important , and if they depend on the galaxy potential , then one might expect to see a systematic variation of effective yield with galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite looked at the variation of metallicity versus gas fraction in a sample of dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies , and noted that the effective yields derived for these galaxies were quite low compared to the expected yields .",
    "they suggested that outflows of gas could account for the apparent low observed values of @xmath6 with respect to gas content .",
    "however , they derived total baryonic masses from rotation curves , whereas it is likely that the dynamical mass is dominated by non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "thus , it is probable that @xcite underestimated the baryonic gas fraction",
    ". here i will use the measured galaxy luminosity to estimate the stellar mass .",
    "similarly , @xcite studied effective yields within a variety of spiral galaxies , finding evidence for a variation of @xmath3 with metallicity . since then , a great deal of improved data on abundances ( for example , the surveys of zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 , van zee et al .",
    "1998 , and ferguson et al . 1998 ) and co measurements ( for example , the fcrao survey of co in galaxies , young et al .",
    "1995 ) have become available for both spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "i will use these new measurements to conduct an expanded investigation of effective yields in galaxies .",
    "the following sections will describe the data used and the results derived for global effective yields .",
    "the sample of 31 spiral and 13 irregular galaxies presented here was chosen to have spectroscopic data on  region abundances covering a large fraction of the galaxy , together with atomic and molecular gas masses from large beam measurements or wide - area maps .",
    "spiral galaxies were chosen primarily from the spectroscopic surveys of @xcite , although a number of galaxies were chosen from various individual studies , cited in table 1 .",
    "the irregular galaxies were chosen largely from the nearby sample listed in @xcite ; the  region - like blue compact dwarf galaxies are generally excluded because their intense star formation activity makes it difficult to estimate the underlying stellar mass density from the blue luminosity .",
    "tables 1 - 3 list the galaxies in the sample , their structural properties , and the abundance and gas data adopted .",
    "the criteria for selection of data is described below .",
    "i use radial o / h distributions obtained from direct spectroscopic studies of  regions for consistency .",
    "measurements of o / h derived from narrow - band imaging studies exist for a number of galaxies ( mainly barred spirals ) , but such measurements typically show a large amount of point - to - point scatter which could reflect real o / h variations but could also be due to variations in excitation , so it is not completely clear if these data can be compared to direct spectroscopic measurements in a consistent way . for this study",
    "i use the value of o / h at the b - band effective ( half - light ) radius of the disk , @xmath11 , as a surrogate for the mean metallicity of the young component .",
    "@xmath11 = 1.685 times the exponential scale length @xmath20 @xcite , easily derived from disk photometric properties .",
    "o / h(@xmath11 ) is determined by interpolating the derived o / h gradient .",
    "the accuracy of this determination depends on the number of  regions measured and the radial fraction of the disk sampled by the observations @xcite . to ensure relatively precise values of o / h(@xmath11 ) while retaining a useful number of galaxies to study , i selected spiral galaxies with at least five  region measurements covering a radial range @xmath21 @xmath18 0.5 , where @xmath22 is the radius at which the surface brightness falls to 25 magnitudes per square arcsecond and @xmath23 is the difference in radius between the innermost and outermost observed regions . for comparison ,",
    "i include results based on using the value of o / h at one disk scale length , o / h(@xmath20 ) ; this change has little effect on the overall results .",
    "a small fraction of the interstellar oxygen in the neutral / ionized gas is incorporated into metal oxide and silicate grains .",
    "this fraction is expected to be no larger than 15 - 20% , based on the maximum amount that can be used if all of the interstellar mg , si , and fe were depleted into such grains .",
    "ices are not a significant contribution to depletion of o in the diffuse ism @xcite",
    ". observations of o / h from interstellar absorption lines in the local ism suggest that there is little variation in the fraction of o that could be in grains @xcite . whether the fraction of the heavy element abundance that is locked up into grains varies with metallicity",
    "is poorly known , although the dust - to - gas ratio does appear to vary with metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , the fraction of o that is not counted because it is in grains can be argued to be insignificant compared to other contributions to the uncertainties of the derived effective yields .",
    "atomic gas typically accounts for the majority of the gas content of a spiral or irregular galaxy .",
    "the atomic component tends to be very extended compared to the stellar disk in spirals and irregulars , as much as 3 - 4 times the photometric radius @xmath22 in spirals @xcite and even more in dwarf irregulars .",
    "thus , for nearby galaxies with large angular sizes such as m101 the atomic gas angular extent can be 1@xmath24 or more , necessitating large - scale mapping to determine the total gas content .",
    "for this study i use the total  content derived from either single dish measurements or fully sampled maps .",
    "i have tried to avoid using aperture synthesis  maps because aperture synthesis measurements tend to lose diffuse flux on large scales due to missing short antenna spacings , and because the fields covered are often not large enough to include the outer regions of the largest nearby galaxies .",
    "fortunately , many of the nearby galaxies have either large - beam single - dish measurements or fully - sampled 21 cm maps over large enough scales to sample all of the atomic gas on kiloparsec size scales , adequate for studies of the total mass and bulk surface density distribution .",
    "the atomic gas masses adopted for the sample galaxies , multiplied by a factor 1.33 to account for helium , are listed in tables 2 and 3 , along with the references for the 21 cm line measurements . in cases where multiple measurements exist ,",
    "i have used the curve of growth of 21 cm flux versus beam ( or map ) size to estimate the total  mass and its uncertainty . in most cases",
    "the uncertainty in the total  mass is about 10 - 15% .",
    "the molecular gas component is the environment for star formation , and can also contribute significantly to the gas surface density in the inner disks of spirals .",
    "unfortunately , cold h@xmath25 is very difficult to observe directly ; the co molecule is used as a tracer of the molecular component , with considerable debate over the conversion from co flux to h@xmath25 column density and its dependence on metallicity and enviroment . moreover , compared to 21 cm measurements , relatively few galaxies have been fully mapped in co. the co flux falls rapidly with radius outside the inner few kiloparsecs of many spirals , and is vanishingly faint in irregular galaxies .",
    "i have collected co measurements from the literature for the sample galaxies , and have used fully sampled maps to estimate the h@xmath25 mass where possible ; otherwise , most of the adopted integrated fluxes have been taken from the fcrao survey @xcite . the same cautions on using aperture synthesis observations for h",
    "i masses applies to co measurements as well . of the 31 spirals listed in table 1 ,",
    "only 23 have co measurements suitable for estimating the mass of molecular gas .    to estimate m(h@xmath25 ) for the galaxies in my sample ,",
    "i have converted the measured co fluxes from the literature adopting a constant n(h@xmath25 ) - i(co ) conversion factor of 3@xmath2610@xmath27 @xmath28 ( k km s@xmath1)@xmath1 @xcite , which includes the correction for helium .",
    "i adopt this approach for several reasons :    \\(1 ) in spirals , co is detected largely in regions with metallicities within a factor of two or so of the solar value . if there is a systematic variation in n(h@xmath25)/i(co ) with metallicity , it is probably modest over this range of o / h .",
    "( 2 ) assuming this conversion , the fraction of molecular gas is typically less than 50% in massive spirals , and much less in low - mass galaxies ( figure 3 ) .",
    "thus , the contribution to the error in the total gas mass due to the uncertain metallicity correction is probably small compared to the uncertainty in the standard conversion factor .",
    "\\(3 ) in metal - poor irregular galaxies , the co fluxes are so small that the derived h@xmath25 masses are negligible compared to the , even if one assumes a strong metallicity dependence of n(h@xmath25)/i(co ) as in @xcite .",
    "an illustration of this is given by the case of ngc 4214 , a highly active star - forming irregular galaxy with 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived m(h@xmath25 ) = 4@xmath2610@xmath29 m@xmath30 assuming n(h@xmath25)/i(co ) = 4@xmath2610@xmath27 , while @xcite estimated m(h@xmath25 ) @xmath2",
    "10@xmath31 m@xmath30 assuming n(h@xmath25)/i(co ) = 2@xmath2610@xmath32 . from @xcite",
    "we derive n(h@xmath25)/i(co ) = 6.3@xmath2610@xmath32 for 12 + log o / h = 8.2 , which would increase the above values for m(h@xmath25 ) to 6.3@xmath2610@xmath33 m@xmath30 and 3@xmath2610@xmath31 m@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this can be compared to the atomic gas mass of 2.4@xmath2610@xmath34 m@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "thus , even with the strong metallicity dependence of @xcite the molecular gas in dwarf irregulars is only a small fraction of the total gas mass .",
    "masses for the stellar component of galaxies may be even more uncertain than the molecular gas content .",
    "dynamical masses can not be used to estimate the stellar component , so we must rely on converting the measured luminosity to mass via an estimated mass - to - light ratio , @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36-band photometry is less sensitive to variations in @xmath35 and dust attenuation than optical photometry , but wide - field ir imaging , or even @xmath10 or @xmath37-band imaging , is generally unavailable for the nearby galaxies with large angular sizes .",
    "for this study i used the integrated @xmath38-band magnitudes and @xmath39 colors from the rc3 @xcite to estimate masses for the stellar components . to see the effects of uncertainties in @xmath35 on the results i derived the stellar component for the spirals two different ways : ( 1 )",
    "first , i used the relations for @xmath35 versus color from @xcite , who showed that @xmath35 is quite well correlated with color for a variety of optical bandpasses based on the results of population synthesis models .",
    "( 2 ) second , i assumed a constant @xmath35 = 2 for all spiral galaxies .",
    "this is roughly an average @xmath35 for disks derived from photometric and kinematic analyses , e.g. , @xcite . for the irregulars",
    ", i assumed a constant @xmath38-band @xmath35 = 1 .",
    "this number is fairly uncertain ; the population synthesis models become degenerate at low metallicities , and the bursty star formation histories of irregulars makes comparison with simple stellar population models difficult .",
    "as we shall see , a factor two uncertainty in @xmath35 will not significantly affect the trends i derive .      as derived here , the gas fraction @xmath13 is simply the total gas mass divided by the sum of the gas mass and the mass in stars .",
    "it is fair to ask whether the reservoir of gas that lies external to the stellar disk should be counted toward the total , on the grounds that such gas may never have participated in star formation , and so may not have abundances that can be smoothly extrapolated from the distribution in the inner disk . on the other hand ,",
    "to estimate @xmath3 we need to know the amount of gas that @xmath40 participate in star formation , and since viscous processes can mix gas from the outer disk to the inner regions , the gas in the outer disk may be very relevant to the total .",
    "since irregular galaxies have a larger fraction of gas outside the stellar disk than spirals , a discontinuous drop in the metallicity of the outer gas could introduce a bias in comparing effective yields .",
    "one can roughly estimate the relative effect by assuming that the gas outside the stellar disk has a much lower metallicity .",
    "i will assume for illustration purposes that 90% of the gas in an irregular lies outside the region where stars are found .",
    "i will also assume that this fraction of the gas has o / h = 1@xmath2610@xmath41 ( approximately 0.001 times solar ) , while the remaining gas has o / h = 2@xmath2610@xmath42 ( similar to the value in i  zw  18 [ skillman & kennicutt 1993 ] ) .",
    "for the example spiral galaxy , i use the result of broeils & van woerden ( 1994 ) that the average ratio of  diameter to stellar disk diameter d()/d(disk ) is 1.8@xmath430.6 .",
    "if we further assume that the gas distribution is flat , the average d()/d(disk ) implies 76% of the _ atomic _ gas is outside the stellar disk .",
    "( this will likely overestimate the amount in the outer regions , given that  column densities tend to drop outside the stellar disk . ) on the other hand , the molecular gas component is located mostly within the stellar disk radius .",
    "a reasonable assumption for illustration purposes is that 60% of the gas in a typical spiral is within the stellar disk , while the rest is outside .",
    "i will assume that the average o / h of the gas within the stellar disk radius is solar ( 8@xmath2610@xmath44 ) , while outside the disk o / h = 1@xmath2610@xmath41 .",
    "( the widespread observation of metals in the igm at high redshifts @xcite suggests that the metallicity in the outer regions of galaxies is unlikely to be zero . )    with these assumptions , the average o / h for the irregular galaxy would be 2.9@xmath2610@xmath41 , seven times smaller than the value within the stellar disk , while for the spiral the average o / h would be 4.8@xmath2610@xmath44 , 60% of the value within the stellar disk radius . thus , in these cases one would underestimate @xmath3 in the irregular galaxy by a factor seven , and @xmath3 in the spiral galaxy by a factor 1.7 , leading to a relative bias of a factor four in the difference in @xmath3 between the irregular and the spiral .",
    "this rough estimate of the possible bias should be kept in mind during the discussion of the results shown in figure 4 .",
    "table 4 shows the derived gas fractions and effective yields for oxygen for the spiral and irregular galaxies that appear in figures 4 - 6 .",
    "the oxygen effective yields listed in the table are those computed assuming the average oxygen abundance is the value at @xmath11 .",
    "these are the values plotted in figure 4(a ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the basic results from this analysis , the values of @xmath3 for oxygen derived for each galaxy plotted versus @xmath0 . fig .",
    "4(a ) shows @xmath3 based on o / h at @xmath11 and stellar masses assuming color - based @xmath35 .",
    "4(b ) shows the results if constant @xmath35 = 2 is assumed for the stellar component , and fig .",
    "4(c ) shows what happens if we use o / h at @xmath20 as the average .",
    "note that the values of @xmath3 for the irregular galaxies do not change in the three panels , as i use the same assumptions to estimate @xmath3 .",
    "the trend in @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 is very similar in all three panels , showing that the calculation of @xmath3 is fairly robust to changes in the assumptions ; these affect mainly the scale of @xmath3 in the spirals .",
    "the scatter in @xmath3 at a given @xmath0 is fairly large , about @xmath430.2 dex , reflecting mainly the uncertainties in disk @xmath35 and @xmath45 .    despite the uncertainties , figure 4 shows a systematic increase in @xmath3 by a factor of 10 to 20 as @xmath0 increases from a few km s@xmath1 up to 300 km s@xmath1 . at this point",
    ", we return to the discussion at the end of section 3.5 and note that if the large gas reservoirs in the outer parts of spirals and irregulars are more metal - poor than expected from extrapolation of the inner disk abundances , then @xmath3 could be biased toward lower values by a factor of 4 - 5 relative to the spirals .",
    "nevertheless , figure 4 shows that the smallest irregular galaxies are clearly underabundant relative to spirals , if the true yield does not vary much with metallicity . note that the dashed line corresponding to the solar value for @xmath46 , the solar oxygen mass fraction , is for reference only .",
    "it is also apparent from fig .",
    "4 that log(@xmath3 ) does not increase uniformly with @xmath0 .",
    "most of the increase occurs for @xmath0 @xmath47 100 km s@xmath1 . for @xmath0 @xmath48 200 km s@xmath1",
    ", @xmath3 appears to constant ( within the scatter ) .",
    "thus , @xmath3(o ) appears to asymptotically approach a constant for galaxies with @xmath0 @xmath18 150 - 200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "there is an unfortunate gap in data for galaxies with 140 km s@xmath1",
    "@xmath47 @xmath0 @xmath47 200 km s@xmath1 , so where this approach toward constant @xmath3 occurs is not as clear as it could be .",
    "the reason for this gap is not clear , but it seems be due mainly to one or another missing piece of information ( such as  or h@xmath25 data ) , rather than to sample bias .",
    "the interesting question for purposes of the discussion here is at what point we can say that @xmath3 is essentially constant with @xmath0 ?",
    "it is fair to say that this is true for @xmath0 @xmath18 200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the gap for rotation speeds between 140 and 200 km @xmath1 makes it difficult to determine if there is a clear demarcation .",
    "another factor is the potential bias discussed in section 3.5 .",
    "if such a bias in determining @xmath3 exists , then the turnover point could be at significant lower @xmath0 , perhaps as low as 60 - 80 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this argues that measurements of the metallicity in the outer gas reservoirs of both irregulars and spirals should be a high priority for future observations .",
    "another major source of uncertainty is @xmath35 for the stellar component ; if @xmath35 for the stellar component in the irregulars is significantly smaller , we would derive larger values of @xmath3 for those galaxies and the turnover in @xmath3 could be driven down to smaller @xmath0 . better estimates of @xmath35 for stellar populations should also be a high priority for the future .",
    "it is also of interest to see if other types of star - forming galaxies follow the same trends seen in figure 4 .",
    "for example , figure 5 shows effective yields derived for low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies from the sample of @xcite , displayed as open circles . in this case",
    "the gas fractions and yields have been derived assuming a constant @xmath35 = 1 for the lsb galaxies , rather than using the values assumed by @xcite based on maximal disk models for the rotation curve ( which probably overestimate the @xmath35 for the disk ) . in most cases , my assumption for @xmath35 leads to larger gas fractions than obtained by @xcite , and thus to larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "figure 5 shows that the smaller lsb galaxies have derived @xmath3 values similar to those of the irregulars , but that the more massive lsb galaxies appear to fall below their high surface brightness counterparts .",
    "this is curious , as a plot of @xmath3 vs. average surface brightness ( not shown here ) shows the lsbs to fall among irregular galaxies with similar average surface brightness .",
    "one concern is that the lsb galaxies with the largest @xmath0 values tend also to have small estimated inclinations , and the lsb galaxies studied by @xcite have sizes only a few times larger than the beam size of the  measurements .",
    "relatively small errors in the inclination could lead to a large error in @xmath0 , especially if the gas has a different inclination than the stellar component , as is often seen for nearby irregular galaxies .",
    "however , if the rotation speeds are accurate , it would follow that lsb spirals tend to have smaller @xmath3 than hsb galaxies with comparable @xmath0 .",
    "if this is true , then it can not be said that lsb galaxies are simply slowly - evolving counterparts to hsb spirals .",
    "@xcite presented evidence that virgo cluster spirals with greatly truncated  disks have higher ism abundances than field spirals with comparable @xmath8 , @xmath0 , and hubble type .",
    "@xcite noted that the apparent enhancement of o / h is largest for those virgo spirals with the most disrupted gas disks , which are presumed to have passed through the center of the cluster ; meanwhile spirals with relatively normal  disks have o / h comparable to similar field spirals .",
    "they argued that in the cluster environment spiral galaxies have their gas reservoirs stripped , reducing metal - poor infall and leading to an apparent enhancement of the metallicity in the cluster spirals .",
    "this idea can be tested by looking at @xmath3 . in the simple chemical evolution model with metal - poor infall",
    "( but no outflow ) , truncation of the infall would result in the galaxy evolving more like a closed box model .",
    "the effective yield in this case would be higher than for a galaxy that is experiencing infall ( fig .",
    "2 ) . thus we should expect the stripped virgo spirals to have larger effective yields than those for the field spiral sample .",
    "figure 6 shows this comparison , where the stripped virgo spirals from @xcite are plotted as unfilled squares .",
    "no systematic offset is seen between the virgo spirals and the field spirals .",
    "it is possible that the considerable uncertainties in @xmath3 preclude the detection of such an offset , and the virgo sample may be too small to show an offset statistically , but the straightforward interpretation of figure 6 is that the high abundances in stripped virgo spirals is not a result of truncated cosmological infall .",
    "as noted in section 2 , either outflows or metal - poor inflows can reduce the effective yield .",
    "then how do we interpret the results shown in figure 4 ?",
    "the trend of decreasing @xmath3 with decreasing @xmath0 and galaxy luminosity suggests increasing importance of sn - driven outflows in the smallest galaxies , as suggested by @xcite , and we tend to favor this model as the simplest interpretation .",
    "the smooth increase of @xmath3 with increasing @xmath0 would then imply that the fraction of material lost is a simple function of the galaxy potential .",
    "flattening of the trend for @xmath0 @xmath18 100 - 150 km s@xmath1 would indicate that such massive galaxies essentially retain all of the metals produced by stars in those galaxies ; gas may be driven into the halo by sn - driven outflows , but the ejected gas eventually rains back down onto the galaxy to enrich the disk .",
    "@xcite , using a different argument , suggested that escape of hot gas in galactic winds occurs for galaxies with @xmath0 @xmath47 130 km s@xmath1 , similar to what i find here .",
    "alternatively , it would be necessary to posit a conspiracy between inflow and outflow that keeps the massive spirals at roughly the same @xmath3 regardless of mass .    in a strict sense",
    ", it is not possible to rule out pure inflow of metal - poor gas as a cause of the trend in figure 4 from this data alone .",
    "the interpretation of figure 4 in this case would be that dwarf galaxies have accreted a larger fraction of outside gas at relatively late times compared to spirals .",
    "evidence for inflow of gas onto dwarf galaxies is much more scarce than evidence for outflows , although @xcite and @xcite argue that ngc 5253 may be accreting gas that is fueling the current starburst , and @xcite show that ic 10 has extended plumes of that they interpret as gas infalling onto the galaxy . however , to explain the low effective yields for the dwarf galaxies would require as much as 80 - 90% of their gas to have been accreted at late times without much star formation and subsequent metal enrichment .",
    "this was demonstrated by @xcite for galaxies for a wide range in the ratio of accretion rate to star formation rate .",
    "only models in which gas was accreted much faster than the star formation rate acheived low effective yields ; galaxies with slow accretion ( and no outflows ) tend to have effective yields that approached the true yield with time .",
    "local group dwarf irregular galaxies show a large range of star formation histories , but they are consistent with a roughly constant , if low , star formation rate over the past 10 gyr @xcite , so unless they have all accreted large amounts of gas in the recent past , it would be difficult to explain their low effective yields with pure infall",
    ".    stripping of gas can also reduce @xmath3 by decreasing the gas fraction at a fixed metallicity .",
    "this could be particularly important for low - mass satellites of large galaxies .",
    "stripping could indeed lead to a trend like that seen in figure 4 , since dwarf galaxies are more likely to be stripped of gas than the more massive spirals .",
    "this could certainly be relevant to galaxies like the magellanic clouds , where evidence for tidal stripping is strong .",
    "moreover , the detection of hot gas in even small groups of galaxies @xcite makes it more likely that ram pressure can play a role even in relatively low - density galaxy environments . @xcite",
    "cite holmberg ii as an example of possible gas stripping from a dwarf galaxy despite its location on the edge of the m81 group , and ic 10 could also fall into this picture . on the other hand ,",
    "sextans a , which is on the edge of the local group , shows no evidence for a disturbed gas disk @xcite . sorting out the origin of extended gas structures in dwarf irregulars will require deep   mapping of many more galaxies . in the meantime , the dwarf irregulars included in this sample are relatively isolated , so we might expect that gas stripping is less likely to be important in determining the effective yields . furthermore , stripping is much less efficient in reducing the effective yield than direct loss of metals : very small galaxies like leo a would have to have some 80 - 90% of their gas stripped to account for their low effective yields .",
    "if we accept the premise that the variation of @xmath3 is the result of increasing importance of outflows of metals in low - mass galaxies , then the rotation speed tells us which galaxies are likely to be enriching the igm .",
    "we can then discuss the fates of outflows observed in various starburst galaxies .",
    "for example , we can infer that low - mass starburst galaxies such as i zw 18 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 30 km s@xmath1 ) and ngc 1569 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 40 km",
    "s@xmath1 ) probably lose a large fraction of the metals produced by their stars into the igm . on the other hand , in more massive spirals with outflows , such as ngc 253 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 210 km s@xmath1 ) and ngc 4631 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 150 km s@xmath1 ) , metals ejected into their halos probably remain bound , to fall back onto the disk in a fountain .",
    "m82 presents a more ambiguous case because of its peculiar rotation curve : the galaxy has a maximum rotation speed of about 200 km s@xmath1 , but this declines with distance from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "another complication is its location in the dense m81 group environment , since gas ejected into the halo can suffer tidal stripping .",
    "if the fraction of metals that is lost by a galaxy is known , it is possible to estimate the contribution to igm enrichment by galaxies of a given @xmath7 or @xmath0 .",
    "this is important to understanding the element abundance pattern in the igm , as dwarf galaxies have a different element abundance pattern than spirals .",
    "given the present uncertainties in data for effective yields , it is not yet possible to say with great precision what range of galaxies contribute most to igm enrichment , but we can make a crude estimate of the relative contribution to igm enrichment as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "i approach this by assuming a schechter luminosity function of the form    @xmath49    where @xmath7 is the b - band luminosity , and i adopt @xmath50 = @xmath511.2 , log @xmath52 = 10.16 ( @xmath8 = @xmath5120.2 ) and @xmath53 = 1.0@xmath2610@xmath54 based on the field galaxy studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , scaled to a hubble constant of 75 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 .",
    "the actual normalization of @xmath53 is not important since i will only examine the relative contributions of metals to the igm .",
    "i further assume :    1 .",
    "the trend of @xmath3 vs. @xmath0 is well described by the function @xmath55 i assume that spirals with @xmath0 @xmath18 150 km s@xmath1 retain all their newly - produced metals with log @xmath3 = 1.95 .",
    "the difference between this value and @xmath3(@xmath0 ) given by the above expression represents the fraction of metals lost by a galaxy .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath8 for my galaxy sample can be represented by the expression @xmath56 this is not meant to be a new derivation of the tully - fisher relation , only a parameterization of the data for this galaxy sample .",
    "the o / h - luminosity relation for the galaxy sample is represented by @xmath57 4 .",
    "@xmath35 is taken to be equal to one for all galaxies .",
    "a factor two error in @xmath35 will turn out to have only a small effect on the relative contributions of ejected metals .    as a crude approximation",
    "i take the total mass of oxygen in a galaxy to be the measured oxygen mass fraction times the mass in stars .",
    "then the mass of oxygen lost by the galaxy is @xmath58 where 0.0112 is the average @xmath3 for the massive spirals .",
    "the factor twelve is the conversion from the number ratio o / h to oxygen mass fraction .",
    "convolving this expression with the galaxy luminosity function gives the relative mass of oxygen ejected by galaxies of a given luminosity into the igm in a given volume element .",
    "the results for this set of assumptions is illustrated in figure 7 , where i show the relative mass of oxygen ejected by of all galaxies of a given @xmath8 or @xmath0 .",
    "figure 7 indicates that dwarf galaxies with @xmath8 @xmath18 16 , @xmath0 @xmath47 50 km s@xmath1 completely dominate the enrichment of the igm in the present day universe .",
    "although the approximations made above are crude in some cases , this conclusion is fairly robust to those approximations . a systematic increase in m / l for more massive galaxies would shift the distribution to higher @xmath8 and @xmath0 , but is not likely to make the dwarfs less dominant .",
    "a steeper luminosity function would only increase the relative contribution of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite has similarly noted that dwarf galaxies may contribute the bulk of the intracluster gas in galaxy clusters , although @xcite argue that the dwarf galaxies are unlikely to account for all of the icm in clusters .",
    "note that the analysis presented here does not consider the total amount of gas that may be ejected by galaxies , and that there are other ways to account for the icm , such as ram pressure stripping and tidal stripping of gas ejected during disk galaxy mergers in dense cluster environments @xcite .",
    "if dwarf galaxies dominate in contributing metals to the igm , the abundance pattern of the intergalactic medium should reflect that of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "irregular galaxies tend to be deficient in nitrogen and carbon relative to oxygen .",
    "fe / o is not well known in ionized nebulae because of depletion of iron onto grains , but could be subsolar or solar , depending on the galaxy s star formation history . if the outflows consist preferentially of supernova ejecta from massive stars , then we would expect c , n and fe to be deficient relative to o and other alpha - capture elements .",
    "note that this analysis may not apply to ly@xmath50 systems at high redshift .",
    "these systems have young ages , and comparison with the galactic halo abundance pattern may be more relevant , although in many respects the abundances in metal - poor dwarf galaxies are similar to those in the halo .",
    "nevertheless , we might expect a similar relationship between metal loss and rotation speed to hold in the early universe as well , determining which systems contribute material to the igm .",
    "ejection of metals by galaxies is closely connected to the question of feedback of stellar energy into galaxies , a subject of intense interest currently .",
    "hierarchical clustering models for galaxy formation have some difficulty in reproducing the relation between luminosity and rotation speed in disk galaxies ; too much angular momentum is transferred from the disk to the halo during the collapse , leading to disks that rotate too fast for their size .",
    "feedback of energy from stars and supernovae into the ambient ism is expected to relieve this problem , by reheating the gas and preventing it from collapsing too quickly .",
    "how feedback should be parameterized in galaxy formation models is poorly understood , however , because star formation itself is poorly understood .",
    "the fraction of metals ejected by a galaxy must be a function of the feedback process .",
    "this connection is complex , however , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "still , the relation between effective yield and rotation speed in galaxies , if it results from the loss of metals in galactic winds , must be related to the feedback of energy from stars into the ism , and thus should be reproduced by successful models of feedback in galaxy evolution .",
    "i have compiled data on gas fractions and oxygen abundances for a sample of approximately 40 spiral and irregular galaxies with rotation speeds ranging from a few km s@xmath1 to 300 km s@xmath1 . from these data",
    "i have derived effective yields for each galaxy based on the closed box chemical evolution model ; variations in effective yields between galaxies assess the relative importance of gas flows in the chemical evolution of those galaxies .",
    "i find that the effective yield varies systematically by a factor of 10 - 20 as @xmath0 increases from 5 km s@xmath1 to 300 km s@xmath1 , asymptically approaching a constant value for rotation speeds greater than 125 - 150 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this variation appears to be a simple function of the galaxy potential .",
    "if loss of newly - synthesized metals in galactic outflows is the main cause of the trend in @xmath3 , the results suggest that massive spirals essentially retain all of the gas ejected in outflows , while dwarf irregulars can lose up to 90% of their metals ; the fraction lost is a simple function of the galaxy rotation speed .",
    "a crude estimate of the mass of metals lost by a given galaxy combined with the field galaxy luminosity function indicates that galaxies with @xmath8 @xmath18 16 and @xmath0 @xmath47 50 km s@xmath1 should dominate the contribution of outflows to the enrichment of the igm .",
    "i thank eric bell for very many educational discussions about surface photometry and mass - to - light ratios and a careful reading of the manuscript .",

    "<S> i present results on the correlation between galaxy mass , luminosity , and metallicity for a sample of spiral and irregular galaxies having well - measured abundance profiles , distances , and rotation speeds . </S>",
    "<S> additional data for low surface brightness galaxies from the literature are also included for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> these data are combined to study the metallicity - luminosity and metallicity - rotation speed correlations for spiral and irregular galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity luminosity correlation shows its familiar form for these galaxies , a roughly uniform change in the average present - day o / h abundance of about a factor 100 over 11 magnitudes in b luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the o / h - @xmath0 relation shows a change in slope at a rotation speed of about 125 km s@xmath1 . at faster @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , there appears to be no relation between average metallicity and rotation speed . at lower @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity correlates with rotation speed . </S>",
    "<S> this change in behavior could be the result of increasing loss of metals from the smaller galaxies in supernova - driven winds . </S>",
    "<S> this idea is tested by looking at the variation in effective yield , derived from observed abundances and gas fractions assuming closed box chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the effective yields derived for spiral and irregular galaxies increase by a factor of 10 - 20 from @xmath0 @xmath2 5 km s@xmath1 to @xmath0 @xmath2 300 km s@xmath1 , asympotically increasing to approximately constant @xmath3 for @xmath0 @xmath4 150 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the trend suggests that galaxies with @xmath0 @xmath5 100 - 150 km s@xmath1 may lose a large fraction of their sn ejecta , while galaxies above this value tend to retain metals . </S>"
