    "quiescent prominences are long - lived , partially - ionized , plasma condensations in the tenuous , million - degree hot , ionized solar corona @xcite .",
    "these partially - ionized condensations , at least , their optically - thin observable parts , are typically two orders of magnitude denser and cooler than the surrounding corona . as a macroscopic structure",
    "prior to an eruption , a prominence can be remarkably stable , persisting for days to weeks as a long , vertical slab , approximately @xmath2 wide , @xmath3 tall , @xmath4 long , seemingly suspended by magnetic fields to curve the full prominence length right above and along a magnetic neutral line on the photosphere . by prominence",
    "we shall henceforth be referring to this common type , the polar crown prominence being the canonical example ; see the above review articles for a comprehensive view of prominences of all varieties .",
    "figure 1 is a hinode / sot image taken in the ca ii 396.8 nm `` h - line '' spectral region showing the cool part of the prominence at a high spatial resolution , revealing its characteristic narrow , vertical , dense threads interspersed among narrow , dark lanes .",
    "this static image belies the remarkably dynamic nature of these interior structures .",
    "prominence movies from _",
    "hinode _ and _ sdo / aia _ instruments have established that over internal scales of the order of @xmath5 and time scales of minutes , these structures are in a constant state of motion at less than free - fall speeds in a characteristic range of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the ever - present cool , dense threads are falling whereas the dark lanes among them are narrow streams of hot , tenuous plasma traveling upward at comparable speeds @xcite .",
    "vertical motions in both directions are actually present in both types of structures , but the high - resolution movies show a discernible average descent of the dense threads and a general bubbly rise of hot , tenuous plasmas",
    ". the latter may be the result of rapid heating to coronal temperatures associated with emerging magnetic fluxes that push into the overlying dense prominence material .",
    "this condition may be understood in terms of a nonlinear rayleigh - taylor hydromagnetic instability @xcite .",
    "such emergent - flux structures can be of considerable sizes that first form quasi - statically beneath a quiescent prominence before pushing their ways clear through the prominence without a macroscopic eruption @xcite .    a recent quantitative analysis of the motions of descending threads observed with _ sdo / aia _ indicates that over a 20 hour period , an order of magnitude more mass may be drained in this manner than found at any one time in a moderate - size , slowly evolving prominence @xcite .",
    "using the lower end of the range of observed prominence densities to compute , the drainage can remove some @xmath7 from the corona in a day , a mass comparable to that of a coronal mass ejection . of particular interest is that the drainage rate estimated from observation is changing in proportion to the slowly - changing , estimated total prominence mass during quasi - steady evolution .",
    "this observational result raises two questions . how does the observed significant mass drainage via cool threads relate to the replenishing mass - injection represented by the upward streams of hot , tenuous plasmas ?",
    "berger et al .",
    "( 2011 ) propose that emerging magnetic flux drives a constant cycling of mass from the photosphere , in the form of tenuous hot plasma , into the coronal cavity overlying a quiescent prominence .",
    "this up - flow returns as the draining vertical threads , essentially establishing a novel form of magneto - thermal convection in the solar outer atmosphere .",
    "the other question relates to the embedded magnetic fields in these processes .",
    "spectral polarimetric observations have shown that quiescent prominence plasmas embed typically horizontal , local fields of the order of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these fields are sufficiently intense to dictate the structures of their prominences under a high degree of the frozen - in condition due to high electrical conductivity . in particular , a large amount of mass can be supported by fields of the observed intensities . yet",
    "more mass can drained through the prominence in less than a day than the amount trapped quasi - steadily in the prominence at any one time .",
    "how is the observed drainage reconcilable with the observed prominence field being generally horizontal if we accept the frozen - in condition ?",
    "an attractive hypothesis is that it is in the nature of prominence dynamics to develop such extreme physical conditions that the usual frozen - in condition breaks down spontaneously .",
    "this hypothesis is what we set out to investigate as a theoretical hydromagnetic possibility .",
    "the first paper of the series here treats the case of thermal collapse during plasma condensation producing cold , dense , poorly ionized plasmas within which the frozen - in condition can not be sustained .",
    "the second paper takes up a separate piece of physics , demonstrating that despite the high magnetic reynolds - numbers of the prominence interior , magnetic reconnection takes place readily via spontaneous formation and dissipation of electric current - sheets @xcite .",
    "the two papers provide a hydromagnetic basis to understand the observed restless interior of a prominence .",
    "specifically the first paper here treats the following theoretical problem .",
    "we construct a complete family of exact solutions describing a vertical kippenhahn - schlter ( ks ) plasma - slab supported against gravity in a bowed magnetic field in unbounded space , varying only in the direction perpendicular to the slab @xcite . we assume static force equilibrium under ( i ) the frozen - in condition and ( ii ) a steady balance among optically - thin radiation , heating , and thermal conduction directed along the field .",
    "these three energy processes take the theoretical forms studied by low & wu ( 1981 ) , representing an energy transport of a minimum physical complexity relevant to prominences . despite its one - dimensionality",
    ", the ks slab captures important properties of this complex system .",
    "the novel result of the study is that the set of everywhere - analytical solutions found in the earlier study is only a subset of measure zero of all the physically admissible equilibrium states of the ks slab .",
    "generally , force - balance and steady energy - transport can not both be met under the frozen - in condition without a fraction of the total mass of the slab having collapsed into a mathematical singularity representing an exceedingly cold , dense sheet at the center of the otherwise diffuse slab .",
    "the weight of that mass sheet is supported by a discrete lorentz force due to a discrete electric current in the sheet .",
    "this discrete current can be maintained only if the frozen - in condition is rigorously obeyed , that is , the electrical conductivity is infinite .",
    "the electrical conductivity in the solar atmosphere is large but finite , of course . in that case ,",
    "an evolution to equilibrium must at first seek a state with an inevitable singularity when the frozen - in condition does apply to a very high degree .",
    "as the singularity develops , the small nonzero electrical resistivity unavoidably becomes significant at a point in time , resulting in current dissipation .",
    "a breakdown of the frozen - in condition thus occurs spontaneously .",
    "the general inevitability of mass - sheet singularity in the ks - slab is demonstrated in section 2 .",
    "the singular equilibrium solutions containing a mass sheet with a discrete current are analyzed in section 3 .",
    "the breakdown of the frozen - in condition is illustrated in section 4 , treating an exact solution for a steady , vertical resistive hydromagnetic flow and pointing out the need for a more realistic multi - fluid description .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 to relate in general terms to the physics of prominences .",
    "we adopt a one - fluid hydromagnetic description of the corona and prominence : @xmath9 & = & { 1 \\over 4 \\pi}(\\nabla \\times { \\bf b } ) \\times",

    "the time @xmath22 for a magnetic structure of characteristic length @xmath21 to diffuse resistively is another indicator of the importance of resistive effects .",
    "set @xmath23 as the limit of spatial resolutions achievable with a ground - based telescope .",
    "then the spitzer ( 1962 ) resistivity @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the temperature , gives @xmath26 well in excess of tens of years or longer for temperatures in the range of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the frozen - in condition can only break down if a hydromagnetic fluid develops exceedingly small scale structures . in the case of the corona",
    ", these scales may even fall below the mean free path of the fluid , so that the applicable resistivity involves coupling between the large - scale fluid and particle - kinetic effects @xcite .",
    "we are interested in a static equilibrium with a negligible @xmath28 , so that currents may persist permanently .",
    "then , setting @xmath29 , the induction equation ( [ induction_resistive ] ) is irrelevant except to demand that @xmath11 is solenoidal .",
    "the mass - conservation equation is also irrelevant , and static equilibrium is described by the complete set of equations : @xmath30   -   r(\\rho , t ) + h(\\rho , t ) = 0 , \\\\",
    "\\label{ideal_gas } p = { k_b \\over m_0 } \\rho t , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the ideal gas law , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the boltzmann constant and the mean mass of the fluid particles , respectively . force - balance equation ( [ fb ] ) is coupled to steady energy equation ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the latter balances radiative loss @xmath33 , heat gain @xmath34 and a thermal conductive flux aligned along @xmath11 with a thermal conductivity @xmath35 .",
    "the properties of a specific plasma fluid is represented by @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 as known functions of the thermodynamic variables , @xmath13 , @xmath12 and temperature @xmath25 .",
    "this radiative magnetostatic problem is formidable , especially for a three - dimensional system .",
    "we therefore treat a localized one - dimensional system . to keep physical issues in mind we first briefly describe the model in relation to the real prominence and its surrounding",
    ". then we formulate the mathematical problem in section 2.1 and show in section 2.2 that the physically complete set of solutions must include both everywhere - analytic solutions as well as the solutions with admissible singularities presented in section 3 .",
    "the prominence in figure 1 belongs to a larger - scale , three - part coronal helmet - streamer of the kind in the white - light image of a total eclipse in figure 2 .",
    "coronal observation of the magnetic fields external to prominences in the corona is still in its infancy @xcite , but it is physically reasonable to interpret a helmet - streamer to be an arcade of closed magnetic field anchored with magnetic footpoints frozen into the base of the corona @xcite .",
    "this field traps the high density of the helmet - streamer in approximate static equilibrium under the frozen - in condition .",
    "external to the helmet - streamer is the solar wind accelerated from quasi - static conditions at the coronal base .",
    "this wind combs its frozen - in fields into an open configuration , each field line extending from one footpoint anchored in the coronal base out into the heliosphere .",
    "the bright helmet often has a tenuous , dark cavity at its base within which a quiescent prominence can be found located at the bottom of that cavity .",
    "when the line of sight is aligned favorably with the arcade of the helmet - streamer , an exemplary case in figure 2 , this three - part structure is seen clearly .",
    "observations support the interpretation that the cavity is a magnetic flux rope with field lines that wind around within that cavity . @xcite .",
    "the prominence may then be explained as the cool condensed plasma trapped at the bottom of local u - shaped flux tubes under a high degree of the frozen - in condition @xcite .",
    "the frozen - in condition permits no motion of the condensation across magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "our study here sets out to first understand this frozen - in state well , only to discover from the physics of such a state that the frozen - in condition must generally break down in the prominence interior to produce cross - field transport of mass at less than free - fall speeds .",
    "consider a 1d system that depends on only the cartesian coordinate @xmath36 .",
    "let the field have the solenoidal form : @xmath37 , \\ ] ] @xmath38 and @xmath39 being constants .",
    "we are interested in @xmath40 being a monotonically - increasing , odd function with @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",

    "introduce the dimensionless variables , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the hydrostatic density scale height at temperature @xmath47 related to the other normalization constants by @xmath48 .",
    "the ideal gas law is then @xmath49 introduce the two plasma @xmath50-parameters : @xmath51 respectively measuring the importance of the fluid pressure relative to the magnetic pressures of the uniform @xmath52 and the total field @xmath53 . with no loss of generality ,",
    "take @xmath54 to be the pressure at the center of the sheet , ie , @xmath55 , @xmath41 at @xmath56 .",
    "then , the force - balance equations ( [ fb ] ) reduces to the @xmath36 and @xmath15 components : @xmath57 equation ( [ pressure ] ) shows that the total pressure @xmath58 is uniform in space which is a sufficient condition for linear hydromagnetic stability @xcite .",
    "the high pressure of the sheet is confined by the vertical component @xmath59 significant outside the sheet .",
    "equation ( [ fb ] ) can be written in the form @xmath60 in terms of the magnetic tension and the total - pressure force . since the total pressure of the ks - slab is uniform in space , the tension force is everywhere vertical and it alone supports the weight of the plasma .",
    "in other words , the left hand side of equation ( [ density ] ) is essentially the upward magnetic tension force .",
    "we pause to relate the above idealized magnetic field to spectral - polarimetric observations of prominences .",
    "if we identify the concentration of plasma around @xmath61 with the prominence plasma being observed , where @xmath62 , polarimetric observation will detect the horizontal field @xmath63 given by equation ( [ b_bg ] ) .",
    "the observed field has intensity @xmath64 which can fall within the observed range of @xmath1 even with @xmath38 small as long as @xmath39 is sufficiently large .",
    "therefore , the plasma - beta @xmath50 given by equation ( [ beta_0 ] ) may be larger than unity whereas the plasma - beta @xmath65 defined by equation ( [ beta ] ) in terms of the net field is typically less than unity .",
    "this feature simply reflects the fact that a slab of plasma hemmed up by a background field aligned close to the central plane of the slab will snag only a weak component @xmath66 of the field across it .",
    "therefore , the field would sag greatly in the @xmath67 plane with a large value of @xmath50 .",
    "we take advantage of this simplicity of the model to deal with the complexity of thermal balance .",
    "we adopt the temperature - dependent spitzer ( 1962 ) thermal conductivity @xmath68 for a fully ionized gas where @xmath69 . for our theoretical purpose",
    ", we adopt this conduction model in a formal sense with @xmath70 taken as an ad hoc constant , so as to be conceptually specific about the model of thermal conduction adopted . to complete the specification of the fluid s material properties , we take @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constants characteristic of the fluid . here",
    "we model radiative loss @xmath33 to be optically thin , collisional in nature as represented by its quadratic dependence on density .",

    "the origin of heating in the prominence is poorly understood , representing another uncertainty in such thermal models . for our theoretical study",
    "we use an ad hoc heating rate proportional to density @xcite . these choices lead to an analytically integrable model @xcite .",
    "we wish to investigate this model afresh to understand the physical meaning of these analytical solutions .    with the material properties of the plasma fluid",

    "since the heating source is explicitly accounted for by @xmath34 , condition ( [ theta_bc2 ] ) sets the thermal flux to vanish at infinity . in the unbounded model considered here ,",
    "the @xmath34-heating and @xmath33-radiation vanish at infinity .",
    "an external source of thermal flux coming in from infinity would require an unphysical temperature that increases to unbounded values at infinity .",
    "an external sink of thermal flux at infinity is incompatible with the unbounded domain , since a monotonically decreasing temperature must become zero at some finite @xmath82 on either sides of @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath34-heating is the only source of energy in this magnetostatic atmosphere with thermal conduction transporting excess heat to where it can be radiated away .",

    "the model is 1d only in the mathematical sense .",
    "the field is sheared and bowed in 3d space .",
    "this 3d geometry strongly influences energy - balance , represented by the factor @xmath86 in equation ( [ energy2 ] ) . the thermal flux is completely aligned along the field .",
    "this factor depends on the magnitudes of the two field components , @xmath87 and @xmath59 . for large values of @xmath39 and @xmath85 ,",
    "respectively describing high magnetic shear and great sag in the field , the thermal flux enters the plasma slab at a large oblique angle .",
    "the governing equations ( [ ideal_gas2 ] ) , ( [ pressure ] ) and ( [ density ] ) and ( [ energy2 ] ) can be reduced to a quadrature .",
    "this was shown by low & wu ( 1981 ) using @xmath83 as an independent variable and @xmath84 , @xmath79 , @xmath85 and @xmath82 the dependent variables . in that formulation , @xmath84 , @xmath79 , @xmath85",
    "can be solved analytically explicitly in terms of @xmath83 , following which solving @xmath82 as a function of @xmath83 gives the distributions of the equilibrium field and plasma in space . here",
    "we take a different approach , choosing @xmath85 instead of @xmath83 as the independent variable .    by equation ( [ density ] ) describing the vertical balance of force in a slab symmetrical about @xmath61 , @xmath88 must be monotonically increasing in the domain @xmath89 since density @xmath90 is positive .",

    "the greater the total mass the greater is the sag of the field with a large far vertical component and a high pressure @xmath99 at the bottom of the v - shaped field .",
    "we now pose the following mathematical problem .",

    "let us carry out such a transformation and solve for @xmath101 in the three - step development below , leading to a family of physically complete solutions , the meaning of `` physically complete '' becoming clear at the end of the construction .",
    "it is instructive to consider the isothermal solutions , treated by kippenhahn and schlter ( 1957 ) .",
    "such a state arises if the fluid does not radiate , @xmath108 , and is not heated , @xmath109 , but is thermally conducting @xmath110 .",

    "the more pronounced sag of the more heavily loaded field is obvious from the projected field line described by @xmath175 .",
    "the greater sag also implies a steeper rise in temperature as we leave @xmath56 owing to the more oblique incidence of the thermal - conductive flux along the field .",
    "alternatively , the strong @xmath130 in this case may be said to be partial insulating the central part of the slab from the extremely hot exterior .",
    "the temperature gradient in the vicinity of @xmath56 can be further enhanced by increasing the oblique angle of incidence of the thermal flux with @xmath176 , illustrated by the solution in figure 6 .",
    "we recall that @xmath50 is the central plasma beta defined relative to the magnetic pressure due to the uniform component @xmath52 .",
    "if we keep the background field intensity @xmath177 fixed , we may increase @xmath39 as @xmath38 decreases and @xmath50 increases correspondingly .",

    "the solution in figure 6 shows the case with the slab oriented such that @xmath178 , giving @xmath179 . the same slab mass as in figure 4 is now supported in the deep sag in the field line projected on the @xmath114 plane , as described by @xmath175 .",
    "the increased insulation effect of increased @xmath180 and @xmath181 gives rise to the extremely steep temperature gradients in the vicinity of @xmath56 required for energy balance .",

    "to summarize , if we prescribe @xmath187 , @xmath186 fix by the given set @xmath182 , the fluid in equilibrium has an infinity of everywhere - analytical states available , of different @xmath82 dependences , depending on the central temperature @xmath188 as a free parameter .",

    "the central temperature @xmath119 defines a minimum amount of internal energy retained for each piece of the equilibrium plasma .",
    "the @xmath189 equilibrium state is the lowest energy state , a preferred end state in the sense that any higher - energy @xmath190 equilibrium state may evolve in response to perturbations by losing energy . if @xmath190 , the equilibrium @xmath84 is finite , and @xmath191 at @xmath124 . as @xmath125 parametrically ,",

    "that is to say , the integral of @xmath105 over a small interval @xmath194 goes to zero as @xmath195 .",
    "the interesting new point is that , for _ all other _ prescribed @xmath196 with @xmath197 , a contradiction arises if we demand that the equilibrium state is everywhere analytic .",
    "neither the boundary conditions nor the freedom to arbitrarily prescribe @xmath94 can be compromised .",
    "the physics of the governing ordinary differential equations ( odes ) are also not in question .",
    "physics avoids the implied contradiction by admitting discontinuous solutions , known as weak solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "the continuous parts of a weak solution are described by the governing odes , whereas the same physics governs the discontinuities by the integral version of these odes .",
    "the equilibrium states of a fluid specified by a given set @xmath182 are thus generally singular . using set - theory language ,",
    "the infinite set of continuous equilibrium states with @xmath187 is a subset of measure zero of all the physically admissible states .",
    "the inviscid , compressible , supersonic flow past a fixed obstacle is a familiar example of inevitable singularities in solutions to partial differential equations .",
    "the flow must be sub - sonic in the vicinity of the obstacle to enable the fluid to self - communicate and navigate steadily around the obstacle",
    ". a shock front must generally be present where the supersonic flow changes discontinuously to a subsonic flow governed by the integral version of the ideal hydrodynamic equations , the rankine - hugoniot equations .",
    "this surface of discontinuity can be resolved into a continuous layer of finite thickness if we introduce additional physics significant only in that layer .",
    "for example , the introduction of a weak viscosity resolves the shock front into a layer of a thickness determined by the strength of the viscosity .",
    "the singular ks - slab solutions presented in this section are analogous .",
    "the everywhere - analytical continuous solutions , requiring a single fixed total mass @xmath198 , are physically just too restricted .",
    "we first survey the singular solutions to understand their physical meaning . in the next section ,",
    "we address the additional physics one might consider to account for the internal structure of the singularity .      before proceeding , we should point out the case of complete absence of equilibrium for a ks - slab . if radiation is absent , in the limit of @xmath199 in equation ( [ energy2 ] ) , there is no steady state because the unbalanced heat input must everywhere increase the temperature in time . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "if heating is absent , with @xmath200 , there is only one singular steady state .",
    "the fluid simply radiates away what heat it happens to possess to reach zero temperature , collapsing its entire mass @xmath94 into a sheet of zero thickness ; see the isothermal solutions in section 2.2.1 .",
    "when both radiation and heating are present , the total mass @xmath94 critically determines whether energy balance is possible . in equilibrium , the hydrostatic pressure @xmath104 supporting the fluid weight along @xmath11 must be monotonically decreasing outward from the center of the ks slab . with the fixed heating of the form in equation ( [ heating ] ) , this stratification tends to produce a dominance of radiation around @xmath61 and a dominance of heating in the far regions .",
    "therefore stratification must be consistent with a temperature @xmath81 monotonically increasing with distance away from @xmath61 , such that its inward thermal conduction brings the excess heat of the far regions to be radiated away by the dense slab center .",
    "too little mass results in poor radiational loss , and no equilibrium is possible as the unbalanced heat - input keeps the temperature everywhere rising monotonically in time .",
    "too much mass results in the opposite effect , the inability of heating to keep up with the radiational loss due to a high - density massive slab center .",
    "we have two possibilities in this case .",
    "the entire mass may collapse into single massive sheet in a time - dependent evolution , never attaining a steady state and leaving vacuum outside the sheet .",
    "the other possibility is that this collapse takes place but does not involve the entire mass .",
    "the collapse takes out just a fraction of the total mass so that the rest of the fluid in the outer layer achieves a spatially - extended steady state .",
    "these general expectations are met in the quantitative analysis of our ks slab given below .",

    "in other words , @xmath81 goes to zero on either sides with an infinite gradient such that @xmath135 is finite and nonzero at @xmath61 .",

    "then , resistive flows of weakly ionized fluid across the `` supporting '' magnetic field can take place , the second alternative interior - model that takes us a step closer to the observed prominence with its descending threads and rising bubbles .",

    "therefore , we set @xmath286 for a system static in the far regions .",
    "combined with magnetostatic equation ( [ density ] ) , we have the velocity @xmath287 in this resistive flow the energy released from current dissipation is conserved by the release of gravitational potential energy associated with the steady fall of matter .",

    "this time - dependent process is worthy of further investigation .      to address the degree of ionization ,",
    "a two - fluid description is needed @xcite .",
    "such a description is necessarily 2d , quite outside the scope of our study , but the following is an interesting closing point to make .    in a 1d slab of weakly ionized plasma ,",
    "the dominant neutrals are kept from slipping freely across the field by collisions with the ions that tend to be tied to the field .",
    "the system can not remain 1d because there will be diffusion of the neutrals in both @xmath82 and @xmath117 directions .",
    "if we concentrate on the vertical force balance in the central region of a ks - like slab , the following order of magnitude consideration adapted from spitzer ( 1978 , page 294 , eqn .",
    "( 13 - 55 ) ) is instructive .",
    "take the ions to be rigidly tied to the locally horizontal field as the neutrals fall steadily vertically across the field lines in the presence of a mutual frictional force .",
    "for the neutrals as a fluid , its weight is balanced by the upward frictional force acting on it , denoted by @xmath301 .",
    "the ions as a fluid experiences the opposite frictional force @xmath302 as well as the upward lorentz force that effectively supports the total weight . use the spitzer approximation , @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the speed of the neutral fluid falling relative to a stationary ion fluid with densities @xmath305 and @xmath306 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath307 is a thermodynamic constant not greatly sensitive to temperature , ranging in value from @xmath308 to @xmath309 for a hydrogen gas at temperatures in the range @xmath310 , and , we recall , @xmath32 is our notation for the mean molecular weight of the fluid which we shall take to be the hydrogen mass .",
    "we also have the vertical balance of forces for the two fluid components : @xmath311 summing these two equations gives the one - fluid equation ( [ density ] ) following the canceling of equal and opposite frictional forces .    substituting for the frictional force in equation ( [ friction_neutral ] ) given by equation ( [ friction_z ] ) ,",
    "we obtain , after a canceling of @xmath305 as a common multiplicative factor on the two sides of the equation , the speed of fall is independent of @xmath305 : @xmath312 entirely determined by the number density @xmath313 of the ionized fluid .",
    "the speed of fall depends on gravity but it is steady and not of the magnitude of a free - fall speed .",
    "a slippage velocity of @xmath314 is obtained if the ion number density drops to below @xmath315 .",
    "again , this speed of fall would not be significant if not for the principal result of the paper .",
    "if no such poorly ionized fluid form , the frozen - in condition would obtain . then",
    ", if the mass frozen in the the field is greater than @xmath220 , the collapse of the core of the ks slab would bring the temperature at the center to as low as it takes for the number density of the ions to be reduced to the level where the frozen - in condition is invalid .",
    "heating is produced by the friction force and the flow can be thus quenched when the ionization level is increased .",
    "what is interesting is that if the frozen - in condition returns , and the total mass still exceeds @xmath220 , cooling and collapse of the optically thick core recur .",
    "the condensation is thus recurrent and not static for these theoretical reasons .",

    "van ballegooijen and cranmer ( 2010 ) proposed that the prominence plasma is flowing under the frozen - in condition in a 3d tangled global field that has a strong vertically - oriented component .",
    "in contrast , here we propose a spontaneous breakdown of the frozen - in condition to allow a resistive flow across a local horizontally - oriented field .",
    "what seems clear is that all these dynamical processes may occur simultaneously .",
    "our ks - slab model shows that the nonlinear coupling of force - balance with energy - balance under a rigorous imposition of the frozen - in condition must generally produce a cold , zero - thickness sheet of mass if static equilibrium is to be attained .",
    "this mass sheet contains a discrete electric current that generates the lorentz force supporting the weight of the sheet . in a real plasma of a high but finite electrical conductivity",
    ", this discrete current must dissipate resistively .",
    "in other words , the typically high degree of the frozen - in condition must physically break down within the mass sheet . in a time - dependent relaxation to such an equilibrium , a mass sheet would first develop during the time when the frozen - in condition applies approximately . then , in that developing mass sheet , the frozen - in condition soon breaks down to produce a downward resistive flow across the supporting field . yet ,",
    "the frozen - in condition is not broken down permanently .",
    "the implied resistive heating in the sheet , fueled by gravitational potential energy released by the falling , poorly - ionized plasma , can bring back the frozen - in condition , but only to recreate the circumstance under which a thin , cold sheet is again inevitable .",
    "this recurrent spontaneous breakdowns of the frozen - in condition is a physically attractive hypothesis to explain the constantly restless interior of a quiescent prominence as revealed by _",
    "sdo / aia _ and _ hinode _ observations .",
    "gravity , anisotropic lorentz force , optically - thin radiation , heating , and anisotropic thermal conduction all play essential roles in creating what seems quite general circumstances under which thin collapsed mass sheets must form .",
    "the particular optically - thin radiative loss and heating described by equations ( [ radiation ] ) and ( [ heating ] ) are artificial , but they capture basic properties sufficiently well for us to use the ks - slab to demonstrate the inevitability of mass - sheet singularity with mathematical rigor .",
    "our demonstration is surprisingly complete .",
    "the mass - sheet singularity in our ks - slab is resolvable into a sheet of finite width using an exact solution for a cross - field resistive flow to account for the breakdown of the frozen - in condition .",
    "both the static and time - dependent problems of this complex coupling are formidable , especially for 2d and 3d systems .",
    "direct numerical simulation holds the only hope for making progress but to be fruitful this approach must start with a physics - based hypothesis like the one presented here .",
    "much further work is needed to treat physically more realistic energy processes for applications directly to the prominence @xcite and other astrophysical systems , notably the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "observation remains the spearhead in the investigation of quiescent prominences @xcite .",
    "presently not all the observed properties in prominences can be theoretically understood or understood in a unified way .",
    "for example , the sub - arcsecond threads , revealed by ground - based , high - resolution , static @xmath0 images of on - disk prominences , have remained difficult for theory to unify with the space observations of prominences at the solar limb from _ hinode _ and _ sdo / aia _ @xcite .",
    "these two views of prominence structures have also not been reconciled with the polarimetric observations of prominence and coronal magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "observations can pose good physical questions to be addressed theoretically in their own rights , without necessarily aiming at a comprehensive explanation of all the rich observations . in the face of many unanswered questions ,",
    "our series of paper seeks to build up our intuition for seeing the complex observations in terms of the elementary physical principles .",
    "previous works of this kind have addressed magnetic support of the prominence weight under the frozen - in condition using 2d and 3d field models with energy transport greatly simplified or ignored for the sake of tractability @xcite . in complement , models of 1d sophisticated energy transport along field lines , prescribed to be fixed in space , made progress with insights into the condensation processes by suppressing the dynamical interaction of the field with energy transport@xcite .",
    "heasley and mihalas ( 1976 ) pioneered studying the coupling of radiative transfer to the equilibrium forces in a slab model . allowing for gravity and a heuristic approximation of the lorentz force ,",
    "this interesting work encountered an inevitable presence of collapsed mass - sheets , perhaps a rudimentary form of the singularity we found in our ks - slab model ; see also anzer & heinzel ( 1999 )",
    ".    collapsed mass sheet may be a common occurrence in the corona .",
    "all it takes is a failure to bring energy to where it is needed whenever a particular mode of energy transport becomes over constrained by the coupled requirement of balancing the forces in the gravitationally stratified fluid .",
    "let us conclude with the following intuitive physical picture that has emerged from our study .    in our ks - slab ,",
    "there are two thermal - insulation mechanisms that can keep the prominence cool against the million - degree hot , thermally highly - conducting corona .",
    "the magnetic field is an insulator against thermal conduction across it .",
    "not so well recognized is the self - insulation of the prominence plasma along a flux tube . in a sheared u - shaped flux tube , the frozen - in mass",
    "is gravitationally stratified along the tube so as to progressively radiate away the two thermal fluxes conducted inward from the high - temperature upper parts of the tube in the corona .",
    "if the total mass is large enough , the steady state may be one in which these thermal fluxes are depleted before the bottom of the tube is reached . then the bottom contracts into a cold dense mass simply from want of heat .",
    "the degree of ionization of such a core would fall below a threshold whereupon the frozen - in condition must break down .",
    "the prominence / corona transition is similar to the corona / chromosphere transition of the solar atmosphere but that analogy is just imperfect . in the solar atmosphere",
    ", the bottom of the chromosphere never cools below about @xmath316 because the photosphere beneath it has no bottom and is heated actively by the solar luminosity coming through from below .",
    "if the prominence plasma sitting at the bottom of an u - shaped tube has no internal heat source and is self - insulating , it would simply cool to an equivalent of the solar photosphere with a very different property , one with such high density and low temperature as to break the frozen - in condition .",
    "this massive core would then flow resistively across the field into the adjacent flux tubes .",
    "no steady flow is expected , just a recurrent process of the breakdown alternating with restoration of the frozen - in condition by resistive heating .    in realistic 3d situations , the super - cooled core of a prominence plasma slips resistively out of its optically - thin chromospheric cladding into an adjacent flux tube .",
    "there it can either continue to slip resistively into other tubes further away or else become so ionized in the new hot environment as to be frozen into the new tube it has just occupied .",
    "a sufficiently massive super - cooled core can thus fall through the bottoms of successive u - tubes leaving behind in each of these tubes ionized plasmas at chromospheric temperatures , until the former runs out of mass to remain a collapsed core . a vertical thread of chromospheric plasma is naturally produced .",
    "the movie of such a process made at the cool chromospheric temperature would then show such a thread forming from out of nowhere with a general downward descent .",
    "the presence of u - shaped flux tubes is the pre - requisite of this process .",
    "although such massive , poorly ionized cores are time - dependent objects , this picture argues for the presence of prominence plasmas that are more massive , more dense , much colder , and less ionized than currently being contemplated .",
    "perhaps the canonical observation - based numbers describing the prominence , electron density of @xmath317 , temperature of @xmath318 , degree of ionization @xmath319% , are _ only _ the properties of the optically - thin , chromospheric cladding of the not yet observed , transient , optically - thick cores .",
    "the tangled - field models of van ballegooijen and cranmer ( 2010 ) readily give peak densities well in excess of the aforementioned canonical values .",
    "these models assume a moderate field of only 10 g , whereas even larger densities are implied for fields as high as 60 g given by polarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "our ks - slab suggests that even more extreme densities might occur commonly in prominences .",
    "we emphasize that upward and downward motions accompany this process .",
    "the unloading of a flux tube to give mass to the one below results in the former rising by its resultant overcompensating lorentz force .",
    "correspondingly , the mass - receiving tube below sinks heavily until the lorentz force of its stretched field can hold it swaying into position .",
    "here is an instance of a flux - tube of fluid rising or falling bodily , carrying its frozen - in magnetic flux along with it .",
    "our hypothesis suggests that the cavity magnetic field supporting the prominence is `` porous '' in spite of the high electrical conductivity .",
    "the observations of liu , berger & low ( 2011 ) thus have the significance as a quantitative statement of how porous that magnetic field can be , namely , that an order of magnitude more mass than retained by the prominence at any one time can pass resistively and agitatedly down the cavity field in a day .    in the second paper",
    "we will get a clearer picture of the role of the magnetic field in this process @xcite .",
    "the field actually is the dominant dynamical player , for it can , on its own , create and restore the frozen - in condition in a permanent restlessness @xcite .",
    "this mechanics may be basic to the proposal that the long - lived macroscopic prominence is a form of magneto - thermal convection in the corona proposed by berger et al .",
