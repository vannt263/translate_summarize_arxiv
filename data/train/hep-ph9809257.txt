    "the statistical models , based on the assumption of the quick natural entropy maximization before the freeze - out in the relativistic heavy - ion reaction , have been succesful in describing the total hadron abundancies in various experiments , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "we review here the method developed , and the application to ags e802 @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 experiments in the systematic manner to find if the increase in production of kaons compared to pions can be due to finite volume effect incorporated in relativistic canonical statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "if the net number of any relevant charge becomes large , the task of computing abundancies in an ensemble respecting exact conservation of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 becomes difficult .",

    "in the usual grand canonical partition function , the states respecting exact quantum number conservation are included , but only the conservation of expectation values is demanded . by denoting the set of conserved quantum numbers by @xmath9 , the canonical sum of states , @xmath10 , can be projected from grand canonical one , @xmath11 @xcite . in case of @xmath12 @xmath13 internal symmetries , the projection takes the form @xmath14",

    "let us quote first the expression for the canonical partition function respecting strict conservation of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "after putting in the set of overall charges , @xmath18 , and performing some algebraic excercise @xcite , we find @xmath19 here we have used the modified bessel functions @xmath20 with arguments @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sum of one particle partition functions for particles carrying same set of quantum numbers , @xmath23 , as the hadron @xmath24 .",
