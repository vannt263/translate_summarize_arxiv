    "angola has one of the world s fastest growing economies .",
    "it is a very rich country in terms of natural resources , with oil , diamonds and hydroelectric power , and a very fertile agricultural land .",
    "however , angola remains a third world country with about one third of its population still depending on subsistence agriculture @xcite . in 2009 , the life expectancy at birth was 52 years , population median age was 17 , 45% of the population was under age 15 and only 4% over 60 years , and the total fertility rate per woman was 5.6 .",
    "angola s total population was 10 million in 1990 and it is approximately double that figure today . according to the global health observatory data repository of the world health organization ( who ) , in 2010 the infant mortality rate ( probability of dying between birth and age 1 ) was 98 per 1,000 live births ; and the under - five mortality rate ( probability of dying by age 5 ) was 161 per 1,000 live births , which corresponds to 121,000 deaths per year .",
    "tuberculosis ( tb ) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and the rates of co - infection exceed 1,000 per 100,000 of total population in some countries in sub - saharan africa @xcite . between 1990 and 2005 ,",
    "tb incidence rates tripled in african countries with high hiv prevalence @xcite .",
    "recent data from luanda sanatorium hospital makes it clear that tb is one of the leading causes of death in angola @xcite . in 2010 alone , there were approximately 58,000 new tb cases in angola .",
    "the country established a national program for the control of tuberculosis in 1981 .",
    "however , the civil war destroyed 70% of angola s health facilities , leaving a substantial proportion of the population vulnerable to tb . in 2007",
    "the ministry of health confirmed that the national program was implemented in only 8.6% of health units .",
    "moreover , the internal transport and distribution networks for drugs are unreliable and 40% of clinics have experienced stockouts in tb drugs @xcite . according to who s global tuberculosis control report of 2010 , the figures of tb in angola are as follows : the induced mortality rate per 100,000 decreased from 42 in 1990 to 30 in 2009 ; the incidence rate ( including hiv ) increased from 205 in 1990 to 298 in 2009 ; the new and relapse notification rate increased from 96 in 1990 to 223 in 2009 ; the number of smear - positive cases increased from 3,804 in 2005 to 22,488 in 2009 ; the number of extra - pulmonary tb cases increased from 266 in 1995 to 3,780 in 2010 ; the relapse rate increased from 134 in 1995 to 2,444 in 2010 ; and the total number of retreated individuals increased from 134 in 1995 to 7,776 in 2010 .",
    "treatment success rates vary between 68% in 2002 and 74% in 2005 , and are still within that range today , well below who s target of 85% @xcite .",
    "the multidrug - resistant tb ( resistant to , at least , isoniazid and rifampicin ) was about 2% of all new cases in 2009 .",
    "tb remains a major health problem worldwide . in 2011 , the regional director of who for africa stated that despite the fact that member states have almost universally adopted a strategy to stop tuberculosis , the implementation of this strategy has been ineffective .",
    "co - infections tb / hiv and tb multi - resistance to drugs are some of the reasons for the difficulty in controlling tb @xcite .",
    "most cases of tb are caused by the _ mycobacterium tuberculosis _ , which is usually transmitted via airborne infection from someone who has active tb .",
    "approximately 10% of infected people with _ mycobacterium tuberculosis _ develop active tb disease , that is , approximately 90% of infected people remain latent .",
    "latent infected tb people are asymptomatic and do not transmit tb , but may progress to active tb through endogenous reactivation or exogenous reinfection @xcite .",
    "the anti - tb drugs developed since 1940 have helped to reduce the mortality rates significantly : in clinical cases , cure rates of 90% have been documented and in 2009 angola s treatment cure rate was about 72% @xcite .",
    "three types of tb treatment are available : vaccination to prevent infection ; treatment to cure active tb ; and treatment of latent tb to prevent endogenous reactivation @xcite .",
    "optimal control is a branch of mathematics that involves finding optimal ways of controlling a dynamic system @xcite .",
    "while the usefulness of optimal control theory in epidemiology is nowadays well recognized @xcite , results pertaining to tuberculosis are a rarity @xcite , and specific studies for the situation of angola nonexistent .",
    "our aim in this paper is thus to use real data from angola to study optimal strategies for the minimization of the number of active tb infectious and persistent latent individuals , taking into account the cost of the measures for the treatment of these individuals .",
    "the treatment of active infectious individuals can take different amounts of time @xcite .",
    "here we consider treatments with a duration of 6 months . with these treatments",
    "one of the barriers to their success is that the patients often do not complete them .",
    "since after two months patients no longer have symptoms of the disease and feel healed , many of them stop taking the medicines . when the treatment plan is not completed , the patients are not cured and reactivation can occur and/or the patients may develop resistent tb . the lack of support from family may cause some patients to abandon treatment . statistics from luanda sanatorium hospital show that 15 of the 270 tb patients abandoned the hospital during 2010 . a possible strategy to ensure patients complete the treatment involves supervision and patient support .",
    "in fact , this is one the measures proposed by who s direct observation therapy ( dot ) @xcite .",
    "one example of treatment supervision consists of recording each dose of anti - tb drugs on the patient treatment card @xcite .",
    "these measures are , however , very expensive , since the patients must stay longer in the hospital or specialized people must be paid to supervise patients until they finish their treatment . on the other hand",
    ", it is recognized that the treatment of latent tb individuals reduces the chances of reactivation , even though it is still unknown how treatment influences reinfection @xcite .    in section  [ sec : tbmodel ] we consider a mathematical model for tb from @xcite , which considers reinfection and post - exposure interventions .",
    "we alter this model by adding two control functions : the first control @xmath0 is associated with preventive measures that help active infected patients to complete the treatment ; the second control @xmath1 governs the fraction of persistent latent individuals that is put under treatment .",
    "our aim is stated in precise terms in section  [ sec : opt : cont : prob ] : to study how the two control measures can reduce the number of infected and persistent latent individuals , taking into account the cost associated with their implementation ( optimal control problem  ) .",
    "our conclusion is that a successful implementation of these measures can prevent the increase of new and reinfected tb cases . in section  [ sec",
    ": num : results ] we present numerical simulations for three different strategies and the corresponding optimal control solutions are discussed .",
    "we end the paper with some conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we study the mathematical model from @xcite , where reinfection and post - exposure interventions for tuberculosis are considered . to this model",
    "we add two control functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 and two real positive model constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the resulting model is given by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations : @xmath6 the population is divided into five categories ( , control system has five state variables ) :    * susceptible ( @xmath7 ) ; * early latent ( @xmath8 ) , , individuals recently infected ( less than two years ) but not infectious ; * infected ( @xmath9 ) , , individuals who have active tb and are infectious ; * persistent latent ( @xmath10 ) , , individuals who were infected and remain latent ; * and recovered ( @xmath11 ) , , individuals who were previously infected and have been treated .    the control @xmath0 represents the effort in preventing the failure of treatment in active tb infectious individuals @xmath9 , , supervising the patients , helping them to take the tb medications regularly and to complete the tb treatment . the control @xmath1 governs the fraction of persistent latent individuals @xmath10 that is put under treatment .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , measure the effectiveness of the controls @xmath14 , @xmath13 , respectively , , these parameters measure the efficacy of treatment interventions for active and persistent latent tb individuals , respectively .",
    "we assume that the total population , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , is constant in time . in other words ,",
    "we assume that the birth and death rates are equal . by virtue of this assumption",
    ", we can reduce the control system from five to four state variables .",
    "however , in this paper we prefer to keep the tb model in form , using relation @xmath17 as a test to check the numerical results .    following who s global health observatory for angola in 2009 @xcite , we consider @xmath18 , which corresponds to a life expectancy at birth of 52 years .",
    "this and other values of the parameters are given in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "moreover , following @xcite , we assume that there are no disease - related deaths , and that at birth all individuals are equally susceptible and become different as they experience infection and respective therapy .",
    "the proportion of the population in each category changes according to the system .",
    "two different values for the initial conditions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are considered ( see table  [ statevar_initialvalues ] ) :    * * case 1 * , initial values are borrowed from @xcite ; * * case 2 * , initial values are based on the data from luanda s sanatorium hospital during september 2010 @xcite .",
    "the values of the rates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are taken from @xcite and the references cited therein ( see table  [ parameters ] for the values of all the parameters ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 denotes the rate at which individuals leave the @xmath8 category ; @xmath25 is the proportion of individuals going to category @xmath9 ; @xmath26 is the rate of endogenous reactivation for persistent latent infections ( untreated latent infections ) ; and @xmath27 is the rate of endogenous reactivation for treated individuals ( for those who have undergone a therapeutic intervention ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is a factor that measures the reduction in the risk of infection , as a result of acquired immunity to a previous infection , for persistent latent individuals , , this factor affects the rate of exogenous reinfection of untreated individuals ; while @xmath30 represents the same parameter factor but for treated patients . in our simulations we consider the case where the susceptibility to reinfection of treated individuals equals that of latents : @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is the rate of recovery under treatment of active tb ( assuming an average infectiousness duration of six months ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 apply to latent individuals @xmath8 and @xmath10 , respectively , and are the rates at which chemotherapy or a post - exposure vacine is applied . in @xcite , different values for these rates",
    "are considered : the case where no treatment of latent infections occur ( @xmath34 ) ; the case where there is an immediate treatment of persistent latent infections ( @xmath35 ) ; and the case where there is a moderate treatment of persistent latent infections ( @xmath36 $ ] ) .",
    "the first and second cases are not interesting from the optimal control point of view . in our paper",
    "we consider , without loss of generality , that the rate of recovery of early latent individuals under post - exposure interventions is equal to the rate of recovery under treatment of active tb , @xmath37 , and greater than the rate of recovery of persistent latent individuals under post - exposure interventions , @xmath38 .",
    "it is assumed that the rate of infection for susceptible individuals is proportional to the number of infectious individuals and the constant of proportionality is @xmath39 , which is the transmission coefficient .    from the epidemiologistic point of view ,",
    "an important quantity is given by the basic reproduction number @xmath40 .",
    "this is the expected number of secondary cases produced in a complete susceptible population , by a typical infected individual during his / her entire period of infectiousness @xcite . in the absence of controls ( @xmath41 ) , it is known ( see @xcite ) that the basic reproduction number for system is proportional to the transmission coefficient @xmath39 : @xmath42 the endemic threshold is given at @xmath43 and indicates the minimal transmission potential that sustains endemic disease , , when @xmath44 the disease will die out and for @xmath45 the disease may become endemic .",
    "we can prove that variations of the parameter @xmath39 are associated with different values for the optimal control @xmath0 but do not interfere significantly with the optimal control @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , as expected , as @xmath39 decreases the fraction of latent and infected individuals also decreases . here",
    "we consider @xmath46 , which corresponds to the endemic case ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the measures of control efficacy are fixed to the values @xmath48 , @xmath13 . because the risk of developing disease after infection is much higher in the first five years following infection , and declines exponentially after that ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.5 ) , we take the total simulation time duration as @xmath49 years .",

    "we consider the weight @xmath53 associated with the control @xmath0 to be greater than the weight @xmath54 associated with @xmath1 : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the reason for this is that the cost associated with @xmath0 includes the cost of holding active infected patients @xmath9 in the hospital or paying professionals to supervise them , ensuring that they finish their treatment , which is costly to implement . in section  [ sec : same ] we compare this situation to the one when the weights take the same values : @xmath57 .",
