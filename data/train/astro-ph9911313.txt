    "a multibeam receiver operating at a wavelength of 20 cm has recently been installed on the 64-m parkes radio telescope in australia .",
    "this receiver permits simultaneous observation of 13 regions of sky , increasing the speed of surveys by the same factor . while the main motivation for the development of this system was to survey the sky for hi in the local universe",
    "@xcite , it also enables very efficient surveys for pulsars .",
    "the central observing frequency of 1374mhz is higher than usual for all - sky pulsar surveys , but is ideal for surveys at low galactic latitudes . at lower frequencies ,",
    "sensitive surveys of the galactic plane are limited by the high background temperature , as well as broadening of the pulses caused by dispersion and scattering of the pulsed emission by the interstellar electron plasma .",
    "all of these effects are strongly frequency - dependent and are much reduced at 1374mhz . the jodrell bank and parkes surveys of clifton et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and johnston et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were centred close to this frequency and both were particularly successful at finding many distant and young pulsars , several of which are also x - ray and/or gamma - ray emitters and some possibly associated with supernova remnants .",
    "we are undertaking a survey for pulsars in an @xmath4-wide strip along the galactic plane using the multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope .",
    "this survey is proving remarkably successful and the discovery of the first @xmath5 pulsars is presented elsewhere ( manchester et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we briefly describe the experimental details of the survey in section  2 .",
    "detailed timing observations to determine accurate pulsar positions , pulse periods , period derivatives and other parameters are an essential follow - up to any pulsar survey . timing observations and analysis procedures for the multibeam survey pulsars are described in section  3 .",
    "finally , section  4 describes a particularly interesting pulsar , psr  j1811@xmath01736 .",
    "this pulsar , one of the first discovered in the survey , is in a very eccentric orbit with a companion which is probably another neutron star .",
    "pulsars in such binary systems in the galactic plane are rare , there being only three known which are definite ( psrs  j1518 + 4904 , b1534 + 12 and b1913 + 16 ) and one which is possible ( psr  b1820@xmath011 ) .",
    "such systems are of great interest because both stars act essentially as point masses and they make excellent systems for studying their dynamics with high precision ( e.g. damour & taylor 1992 )",
    ". in particular , the discovery of more systems like these will allow additional sensitive tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity , more precise measurements of neutron star masses , and better estimates of the rate of coalescence of neutron - star binaries , events which are likely to be detected by future gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "the survey of the galactic plane for pulsars using the multibeam receiver on the parkes radio telescope commenced in 1997 august .",
    "the survey observations are made in a 288-mhz band centred on 1374mhz .",
    "receivers for each of the 13 beams are dual - channel cryogenic systems sensitive to orthogonal linear polarisations .",
    "the full width at half - power of each beam is approximately 14  arcmin and , at high galactic latitudes , the system noise temperature of each channel is about 21k .",
    "a large filterbank system was constructed to process the data from the 13 beams .",
    "the filterbank has 96 3-mhz channels covering the 288-mhz bandwidth for each polarisation of each beam , making a total of 2496 channels .",
    "detected signals from individual frequency channels are added in polarisation pairs , high - pass filtered with a cutoff at approximately 0.2hz , integrated and 1-bit digitised every 250@xmath6s , and recorded on magnetic tape ( dlt ) for subsequent analysis .",
    "it is planned that the survey will cover the region @xmath7 about the galactic plane from longitude @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the relatively long observation time of 35min per pointing , combined with the excellent receiver noise performance and the wide bandwidth , gives a high sensitivity , with a limiting flux density for long - period pulsars of about 0.15mjy .",
    "this is about seven times better than the previously most sensitive surveys of the galactic plane ( clifton et al .",
    "1992 ; johnston et al .",
    "survey observations are made on a hexagonal grid of pointings to give complete sky coverage , with adjacent beams overlapping at the half - power points .",
    "a total of 2136 pointings of the 13 beams are required to cover the survey region . at the time of writing , approximately 60 per cent of these pointings have been observed .",
    "analysis procedures are similar to those used in previous surveys ( e.g. manchester et al .",
    "1996 ) with de - dispersion followed by transformation into the modulation frequency domain using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) and harmonic summing to improve sensitivity to the typically narrow pulses .",
    "some periodic interference is present in the data and this is removed primarily by ignoring signals found repeatedly in undedispersed power spectra , both in simultaneous data from different beams as well as from single beams at many different times .",
    "processing is currently being carried out on networks of workstations .",
    "initially , a single coherent fft has been performed over each 35-min data set , giving reduced sensitivity to pulsars in short - period binary systems in which the period is varying due to the doppler effects of the pulsar motion .",
    "the data are now being reprocessed in order to search for such accelerated signals .",
    "pulsar candidates from the initial processing are scheduled for reobservation in order to confirm their identity as pulsars .",
    "we use the centre beam of the multibeam system to make five 6-minute observations , at the nominal position and four surrounding points . in most cases ,",
    "this gives detections at two or three positions , confirming the pulsar and allowing an improved position to be determined with an accuracy of about 2 arcmin . where no detection results from these observations , confirmation is attempted by means of a 35-min observation made at the nominal position .",
    "the improved positions usually permit much shorter observation times in the follow - up timing measurements , because of the higher signal - to - noise ratio obtained when the pulsar is in the centre of the telescope beam .",
    "furthermore , they allow a smaller range of parameter space to be searched in obtaining coherent timing solutions , reducing the overall number of observations required .    at the time of writing ,",
    "about 90 per cent of the observed pointings have been processed using the `` non - acceleration '' search code , whilst analysis with the `` acceleration '' search code has just started .",
    "confirmation observations have been made on most of the better candidates , resulting in the detection of about 400 previously unknown pulsars , most of which are relatively distant , the median distance being @xmath10  kpc .",
    "more than 150 previously known pulsars have also been detected .",
    "the current discovery rate is an unprecedented one pulsar per hour of survey observing time . this rate will decline as regions further from the galactic plane are surveyed , but we estimate the survey will detect at least 600 previously unknown pulsars , nearly doubling the number known before the survey commenced , and providing a significant database for many different follow - up studies .",
    "after confirmation , each pulsar is subjected to a series of timing observations at either the parkes 64-m telescope or the lovell 76-m telescope at jodrell bank .",
    "almost all of the detected pulsars north of declination @xmath11 are being timed at jodrell bank . at parkes ,",
    "data are recorded using just the central beam of the multibeam system .",
    "the jodrell bank observations are made in a 96-mhz band centred on 1376mhz .",
    "dual - channel cryogenic systems receiving orthogonal circular polarisations are used , each channel having a system noise temperature of about 30k at high galactic latitude . each of the two polarisation signals are down - converted and fed into a multi - channel filterbank consisting of 32  3-mhz filters , before digitisation .",
    "data from both parkes and jodrell bank are de - dispersed and synchronously folded at the topocentric pulsar period for @xmath12min to form sub - integrations ; the total integration time per observation ranges between 2 and 30min , dependent upon the pulsar flux density .",
    "each pulse profile obtained by summing over an observation is convolved with a high signal - to - noise ratio `` standard profile '' for the corresponding pulsar , producing a topocentric time - of - arrival ( toa ) .",
    "these are then processed using the tempo program ( see http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) which converts them to barycentric toas at infinite frequency and performs a multi - parameter fit for the pulsar parameters .",
    "barycentric corrections are obtained using the jet propulsion laboratory de200 solar - system ephemeris @xcite . except for especially interesting cases ,",
    "we make timing observations of each pulsar over about 12 months , resulting in an accurate position , period , period derivative and dispersion measure ( dm ) .",
    "this provides the basic parameters necessary for follow - up studies such as investigations of the galactic distribution of pulsars , studies of the interstellar medium and high - energy observations",
    ".    these observations also reveal pulsars which are members of binary systems . after detection , such pulsars",
    "are observed more intensively to determine their binary parameters . of the new pulsars detected so far ,",
    "seven have already been identified as members of binary systems and one of these is described in the next section .",

    "psr  j1811@xmath01736 was initially observed on 1997 august 3 and revealed as a candidate with a 104-millisecond period and dm of 477@xmath13pc . it was confirmed as a pulsar on 1997 december 19 .",
    "this observation gave a period which was substantially different from the initial discovery period , indicating a possible binary nature .",
    "this was confirmed by a series of observations at jodrell bank during the beginning of 1998 which demonstrated that the pulsar was a member of a binary system in a highly eccentric orbit .",
    "[ fig : perphase ] shows the measured period variation of psr  j1811@xmath01736 through the orbital period of 18.8 days .",

    "the results are summarised in table  1 .",
    "errors given in parentheses refer to the last quoted digit and are twice the formal standard error .    using the taylor & cordes  ( 1993 ) model for the electron density distribution in the galaxy and the measured dm , we obtain an estimated distance for psr  j1811@xmath01736 of @xmath14kpc . with the measured flux density at 1400mhz of @xmath15mjy ( table  1 ) , the luminosity of this pulsar at 1400mhz is @xmath16mjykpc@xmath17 .",

    "it is very asymmetric , with a rapidly rising leading edge with an approximately exponential tail following the peak .",
    "the tail is detectable throughout the period and is characteristic of the effects of multi - path propagation in the interstellar medium , more usually observed at lower frequencies . in such scattering ,",
    "the timescale of the exponential , @xmath30 , varies with frequency , @xmath31 , approximately as @xmath32 . over the 288-mhz band of the parkes receiver , @xmath30",
    "is found to vary by about a factor of two , consistent with such a variation .",
    "the amount of scattering is unusually large for a pulsar with this dm observed at around 1400mhz : the taylor & cordes  ( 1993 ) model predicts @xmath33ms , while the observed @xmath30 is about 20ms .",
    "this accounts for the rather large rms timing residual reported in table  1 .",
    "as listed in table  1 , the spin parameters for psr  j1811@xmath01736 imply a large `` characteristic age '' of @xmath34yr , and a relatively low implied surface dipole magnetic field strength of @xmath35 g .",
    "such spin parameters are typical of the known double - neutron star systems ( taylor et al .  1995 ; nice , sayer , & taylor  1996 ) .",
    "this pulsar is located below the `` spin - up line '' on a period  magnetic field diagram ( see , e.g. lyne & graham - smith , 1998 , p115 or phinney and kulkarni 1994 , fig .",
    "1 ) , suggesting that it was spun - up at an earlier stage in its history .",
    "( 12,10 ) ( 0.5,0 )    in addition to the standard astrometric , spin , and keplerian orbital parameters , a satisfactory fit to the timing data requires inclusion of the rate of orbital precession of the pulsar in the fitted parameters , giving @xmath36yr@xmath25 . assuming that the companion star is a compact object , that tidal effects are negligible and that the measured rate of advance of periastron is due to general relativistic effects alone , we have ( e.g. will 1993 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38s , @xmath39 is the binary period , @xmath40 the binary eccentricity , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the pulsar and companion masses , in solar masses",
    ". the measurement of @xmath43 yields a total system mass of @xmath44 m@xmath3 , or an average component mass of @xmath45m@xmath3 .",
    "this compares with the average mass of neutron stars measured in other binary pulsar systems of @xmath46m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the masses of the two stars can be most readily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1m2 ] .",
    "the region under the convex curve is excluded because of the requirement that @xmath47 in the `` mass function '' , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the projected semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit . from fig .",
    "[ fig : m1m2 ] we see that @xmath50m@xmath51 and that @xmath52m@xmath51 .",
    "these constraints on the individual and average masses of the system , the lack of eclipses , the low magnetic field of the pulsar , and the high binary eccentricity , all suggest that the pulsar companion is another neutron star .",
    "if so , this is only the fourth or fifth double - neutron star system discovered in the galactic disk ( e.g. nice , sayer & taylor  1996 ) .",
    "if the companion were a main sequence or giant star , in addition to relativistic effects , classical effects could also contribute to the measured value of @xmath53 ( e.g. lai , bildsten & kaspi 1995 ; kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ; wex 1998 ) . for a pulsar of mass @xmath54m@xmath51 , the relativistic contribution always dominates .",
    "however , for a small range of companion masses around 1m@xmath51 , some remaining @xmath53 could in principle be attributed to a classical quadrupole moment @xmath55 in the companion star .",
    "the neutron star should raise a tide in a companion having radius @xmath56 such that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the apsidal constant and @xmath59 is the instantaneous centre - of - mass separation @xcite .",
    "however , given the orbital parameters and estimates for @xmath58 from stellar modeling @xcite , the values of @xmath55 permitted by the observations are much smaller than would be expected .",
    "thus , a main - sequence or giant companion should result in a much larger @xmath53 than is observed .",
    "this conclusion is not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath41 .",
    "we note that a rapidly rotating main sequence star companion , with spin axis sufficiently misaligned with the orbital angular momentum , could result in a spin - induced quadrupole that precesses the orbit in the retrograde direction , cancelling the tidal effect .",
    "however , this is most unlikely as it requires fine - tuning the spin and tidal effects to be surprisingly close in magnitude .",
    "recently , the companion in another double neutron - star candidate system ( psr  b2303 + 46 ) has been shown to be a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to assess what other constraints exist on the nature of the companion .",
    "searches of a number of optical telescope archives , revealed that the only available images were from the digital sky survey v band , obtained at the uk schmidt telescope .",
    "no sources are visible in the vicinity of the pulsar down to the plate limit of m@xmath60 . unfortunately",
    ", this can only conclusively rule out a red giant companion and a deeper image would be required to test if the companion is a main sequence star ( m@xmath61 ) or a white dwarf ( m@xmath62 ) .",
    "we note that there is no evidence of occultation of the pulsar at any phase of the orbit ( fig .",
    "the closest approach of the two stars depends upon the unknown inclination angle @xmath63 , but is several solar radii , making the occultation of the pulsar by a solar - mass main - sequence companion star possible , but rather unlikely .",
    "these observations do not therefore distinguish between a main - sequence and a compact companion .",
    "however , the whole orbit is smaller than a giant , ruling out the possibility of such a companion .",
    "the absence of significant tidal or quadrupole effects on @xmath64 suggests that the companion star is compact and therefore either another neutron star or a white dwarf .",
    "such binary systems are generally thought to evolve from two initially massive stars .",
    "the formation of a neutron star in the supernova collapse of the primary is expected in due course to be followed by a common - envelope and spiral - in stage . during this time , it is detectable as an accreting high - mass x - ray binary system ( e.g. verbunt  1993 ) , prior to the formation of a second neutron star or a white dwarf . if the pulsar is the second - formed compact object , it is not clear how the magnetic field became so small , an attribute which is generally thought to arise during mass - transfer .",
    "if the pulsar is the original neutron star , the ensuing mass - transfer would have reduced the magnetic field . however , this would also have circularised the orbit which would have remained that way if the companion evolved to a white dwarf .",
    "since the orbit is eccentric , we must conclude that it was probably the formation of a second neutron star which gave rise to the eccentricity .    in the future ,",
    "this binary system is not likely to evolve significantly . because of its relatively large orbital size",
    ", it does not emit significant amounts of gravitational radiation : using the formulae of peters  ( 1964 ) , we calculate that the coalescence time of the psr  j1811@xmath01736 system is about @xmath65yr .",
    "therefore , systems such as this make a negligible contribution to the neutron - star merger - rate calculations which are important for gravity - wave detectors such as ligo .",
