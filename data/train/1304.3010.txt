    "traditional newspapers have been in decline in recent years in terms of readership and revenue ; in comparison , digital online news have been steadily increasing according to both metrics .",
    "recent surveys have shown that about half of the population of the us gets their news online , and about one third goes online every day for news .",
    "the study of patterns of consumption of online news has attracted considerable attention from the research community for over a decade .",
    "this research started with the analysis of access patterns to websites , and has expanded to include topics such as new engagement metrics , personalized news recommendations and summaries , etc .",
    "( see section  [ sec : relwork ] for an overview ) .",
    "one line of research looks at consumption and interaction patterns as a single time series and attempts several prediction tasks on it .",
    "for example , predicting total comments from early comments  @xcite , total visits from early visits  @xcite , etc .",
    "more recent works incorporate attributes from each specific article ( e.g. topic , source , etc . ) into the prediction  @xcite .",
    "we adopt a novel approach , in which we integrate different types of interactions of users with an online news article including visits , social media reactions , and search / referrals .",
    "we evaluate our methods on data from al jazeera english , a large international news network , deeply characterizing different classes of articles , and predicting their total number of page views and their effective shelf - life ( the effective shelf - life of an article is the time span during which it receives most of its visits ) .",
    "the characterization and prediction of user behavior around news articles is valuable for a news organization , as it allows them ( i ) to gain a better understanding of how people consume different types of news online ; ( ii ) to deliver more relevant and engaging content in a proactive manner ; and ( iii ) to improve the allocation of resources to developing stories over their life cycle .    * our contributions . * in this paper we present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the life cycle of online news stories .",
    "our main contributions are the following :    * we find that social media reactions can contribute substantially to the understanding of visitation patterns in online news .",
    "* we characterize two fundamental classes of news stories : breaking news and in - depth articles , and describe the differences in users behavior around them . *",
    "we describe classes of short - term audience response profiles to news articles in terms of visits and social media reactions ( decreasing , steady , increasing , and rebounding ) . *",
    "we improve significantly the accuracy and timeliness of predictive models of total visits and shelf - life of articles , by incorporating social media reactions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : relwork ] provides an overview of previous works related to ours .",
    "section  [ sec : framework ] introduces our data collection and defines the concepts and variables we use .",
    "the main results of our paper are presented as descriptive and predictive analysis in the two following sections : section  [ sec : classification ] describes user behavior with respect to different classes of articles , and section  [ sec : prediction ] demonstrates the importance of incorporating social media information into the predictive modeling of visits .",
    "the last section concludes the paper .",
    "one of the earliest published studies of user behavior in online news was conducted by aikat  , who studied the web sites of two large newspapers from november 1995 to may 1997 .",
    "this work describes many of the patterns still seen in news sites today : visits occur mostly during weekdays and working hours ; readers `` skim '' pages for information so dwell times tend to be short , and there are clear traffic `` bursts '' that can be attributed to specific news developments .    with the advent in recent years of what can be considered as new forms of journalism ( blogs ) and new propagation mechanisms for news ( micro - blogs and online social networking sites ) , the volume of research publications in this area has increased considerably . in this section",
    "we overview a few previous works closely related to ours , but our coverage is by no means complete .",
    "* behavioral - driven article classification . * previous works including  @xcite that have studied online activities around online resources ( e.g. visiting , voting , sharing , etc . ) , have consistently identified broad classes of temporal patterns .",
    "these classes can be generally characterized , first , by the presence or absence of a clear `` peak '' of activity ; and second , by the amount of activity before and after the peak .",
    "crane and sornette   describe classes of visitation patterns to online videos , and present models that are consistent with propagation phenomena in social networks .",
    "lehmann et al .",
    "extend these classes by observing that for twitter `` hashtags '' ( user - defined topics ) the distributions of activity in different periods ( before / during / after ) induce distinct clusters of activity that can be interpreted considering the semantics of each hashtag .",
    "romero et al .",
    "describe how manually - assigned classes of hashtags are related to different shapes of the _ exposure curve _ : the probability that a user will propagate some information ( `` retweet '' in the case of twitter ) after being exposed to the information by a certain number of her neighbors .",
    "yang and leskovec   describe six classes of temporal shapes of attention .",
    "attention is measured in terms of the number of appearances of a given phrase ( of a variation of it ) corresponding to an event .",
    "the patterns describe the distribution of attention over time , as well as the ordering in which different types of media ( professional blogs , news agencies , etc . )",
    "`` break '' the story .",
    "in general , previous works have established that the evolution of the popularity of different on - line items depends on their class .",
    "figueiredo et al .",
    "describe how youtube videos that are posted to a `` top '' page on the website , and videos that are making use of professionally produced content , are different from randomly - chosen videos in terms of their visit patterns .",
    "recently , researchers at url shortening service bit.ly  @xcite described how an article s half - life ( see definition in section  [ sec : framework ] ) is affected by topics , extending a previous observation than in general there are some topics that are more time - sensitive than others  @xcite .",
    "for instance , business - related articles have on average a longer half - life , while articles related to politics / celebrities / entertainment have an intermediate one .",
    "sports - related articles have in comparison a shorter half - life .",
    "previously , bit.ly researchers  @xcite have shown that this half - life is also affected by the social media platform where the link is first posted ( e.g. links on facebook were longer - lived than links on twitter ) .    -0.5em",

    "in this section we describe classes of articles according to patterns of user behavior .",
    "we observe that articles in the two larger sections of the al jazeera english website trigger distinct user behavior patterns : visits and social media reactions on articles in the news section ( 322 articles in our sample ) are different from the ones on articles in the in - depth section ( 139 articles ) .",
    "we depict in figure  [ fig : tagclouds ] the most frequent terms in the titles of articles in these two sections  as in e.g. lehmann et al .  .",
    "articles in the news section are dominated by current events , such as the conflict in syria for this period of time , while articles in the in - depth section are dominated by photos and analyses of some topics .",
    "* table  [ tbl : titles ] includes the most frequent words in titles of articles in these two sections , after converting to lowercase and applying porter s stemmer .",
    "while in our sample the us and syria appear prominently in both sections , articles in the news section include several violent acts , while articles in the in - depth section are dominated by photos and political analysis .",

    "time is expressed in _ hours - equivalent _ , which are hours corrected by the seasonality ( day - night , weekday - weekend ) of traffic on the website , as in  @xcite .",
    "we can see that initially there are a number of visits and activity on twitter and facebook , that decays rapidly after a short time .",
    "this is often the pattern in news media as observed e.g. by  @xcite and others .",
    "after three or four hours , almost all the visits can be explained by `` internal traffic '' , i.e. visitors arriving from the homepage of the site . when the news article is displaced from the homepage by more recent items , after about nine hours in this example",
    ", its traffic slows down considerably .",
    "the profile of in - depth articles can be much more complex .",

    "initially there are a number of visits and activity on twitter and facebook , that decays rapidly after a short time .",
    "this is often the pattern in news media as observed e.g. by  @xcite and others .",
    "after a few hours , a large amount of visits can be explained by `` internal traffic '' , i.e. visitors arriving from the homepage of the site . for most articles ,",
    "once the news article is displaced from the homepage by more recent items , its traffic slows down considerably .",
    "the profile of visits to in - depth articles can be more complex .",
    "figure  [ fig : series - news ]  ( bottom ) depicts the average series for these articles .",
    "we can observe that a sustained level of visits is observed during several hours , as the contents of these articles are not as time - sensitive as those of the news section .",
    "we remark that in both cases ( news and in - depth ) there is considerable variability from one article to another .",
    "news items compared to in - depth items have a more intense first hour , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : scatter_v1h_v7d ] . for news , visits in one hour",
    "are roughly @xmath1th of the visits in the first week , while for in - depth they are on average around @xmath2th .",
    "the two groups are similar to `` promoted '' ( homepage ) and `` not - promoted '' stories in digg as observed in  @xcite .",
    "this difference in behavior can to some extent be explained by the design of the website .",
    "news articles are displayed more prominently on the home page , with the most salient location being typically used by a news item ; however , in - depth articles are also visible across the website , including a prominent slot on the top right corner of every page . additionally to the differences in social media sharing that we discuss next , we observe that long - lived news articles ( in terms of effective shelf - life as defined in section  [ sec : shelf - life ] ) tend to include analysis that would actually make them fit for the in - depth section . indeed , the top-3 longer lived news articles in our observation period are `` profile : malala yousafzai '' ( oct 10th , 2012 ) , `` syrian rebels in uneasy alliances '' ( oct 25th , 2012 ) , and `` malala is the daughter of pakistan '' ( oct 13th , 2012 ) ; their contents , while motivated by specific news events such as the syrian conflict and the shooting of a school girl , do not describe the events but rather the context in which they are taking place",
    ".    * social media . * on average",
    "the ratio of facebook shares to tweets per article is 1.9:1 , which is to some extent consistent with the survey described in section  [ sec : framework - aje ] that indicated that there were twice as many website visitors using facebook as there were twitter users .",
    "additionally , in - depth articles are shared more on facebook given the same level of activity on twitter , as shown in figure  [ fig : scatter_facebook_twitter ] .",
    "on average news articles have 1.6 facebook shares per tweet , while in - depth articles have  2.7 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hist_tweets_unique_fraction ] there is also a difference in the number of unique tweets . on average ,",
    "17% of the tweets about news articles are unique , versus 25% of the tweets about in - depth articles .",
    "this means that a majority of users do not change the content of the tweets when clicking on the `` tweet '' button next to the articles , or when retweeting from another twitter user .",
    "there is also a difference in the number of corporate retweets , as shown in figure  [ fig : hist_tweets_corporate_retweets_fraction ] . on average ,",
    "27% of tweets about news articles are corporate retweets , compared to 44% of tweets about in - depth articles .",
    "this means that for in - depth articles a larger share of twitter activity can be attributed to users who are followers of @ajenglish or @ajelive , and thus are probably more engaged with these twitter accounts .",
    "anecdotally , we know that editors spend more time crafting tweets to promote in - depth articles than news articles , given that the former are not as time sensitive as the latter . in the case of news , the headline is often posted without modifications to twitter , which may produce a comparatively less appealing tweet .",
    "we observe that news articles have attention profiles that are quite predictable , while in - depth and other article categories show significantly more variability .",
    "we focus on the first 12 hours - equivalent after publication of each article in the news section , and observe the time series of data from all sources including internal links , external links , search engines , and social media ( similarly to the time series shown in figure  [ fig : series - news ] , but for each individual article instead of as an average ) .",
    "we then classify articles into several classes based on visit patterns that are apparent from these observations , starting with the largest class ( `` _ decreasing _ '' ) and following with the other classes .",
    "the classification is done by the authors seeking consensus and discussing borderline cases .    at a high level",
    ", the classes of articles in our news sample can be roughly described by an `` 80:10:10 rule '' .",
    "the traffic to @xmath380% of the articles decreases monotonically during the first 12 hours , the traffic to @xmath310% does not decrease , and the traffic to the remaining @xmath310% decreases first , but then rebounds .",
    "articles on each are listed in appendix  [ app : examples ] .",
    "next we provide a brief description of each class and examples of stories appearing in each of them .",
    "we remark that in this work we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive content - based typology for news articles within each attention profile .    * * decreasing ( 78% ) .",
    "the largest article class represents about 78% of the sample set .",
    "articles in this class demonstrate an initial spike in visits following article publication , followed by a rather consistent drop in the number of visits , either immediately ( 244 articles ) , or after a short delay ( 7 articles ) .",
    "delayed onset traffic decreases have been observed before , such as in  @xcite with respect to the shooting in aurora , colorado , in 2012 .",
    "this attention pattern can often be attributed to breaking news that resonates with readers located in a time zone that is off - peak when the article is first posted , such as when that portion of the audience is mostly asleep .",
    "a story about hurricane sandy s movement up the east coast of the united states , for example , sees an initially sharp visit growth that begins to decline as the east coast retires for the evening .",
    "the predominance of this class of article indicates that while news itself occurs , and can even be covered , at a constant rate , in most cases readers will only be interested on a news article for a brief period of time after its publication .    * *",
    "steady or increasing ( 12% ) roughly 9% of the sample s articles retain relatively constant visitor rates during their first 12 hours .",
    "compared to news categories with very short shelf - lives , such as sports news , these articles are remarkably consistent . in this subset of news articles , dramatic news and emotional stories appear to garner facebook shares and , often as a result , extended shelf - lives .    in the u.s .",
    ", multiple articles on obama and romney s sharp - tongued presidential debate drive consistent facebook and twitter responses for a relatively long period of time following the articles publication .",
    "a poll on racism in the us has similar staying power and facebook sharing . in central asia ,",
    "the taliban attack on pakistani schoolgirl malala appears in a number of these articles , where consistent facebook sharing buoys the article traffic beyond average shelf - life . in europe ,",
    "furor over a seismology scandal is posted to facebook , while in the middle east , atrocities in the war in syria and violence between israel and hamas also generate hours of steady traffic .",
    "africa sees a new prime minister in libya , the police shooting of 34 striking miners in south africa , and a bomb attack on a church in nigeria , all of which see sustained traffic thanks in part to significant facebook and twitter sharing many hours after their initial publication .",
    "stories in this group were mostly developing stories and many of them had regular updates .",
    "one such example is the story about malala for which al jazeera sent a correspondent to the swat valley .",
    "being a complex region to cover , a series of news articles and feature stories were written .",
    "in addition , al jazeera reached out to the reddit community for a q&a session which topped the `` ask me anything ( ama ) '' section . section .    a relatively small number of articles ( 3% of our sample ) buck the usual trend and see increased page traffic as time passes after their publication , rather than a decline .",
    "to the extent that these articles can be generalized , they resemble the class of articles detailed above .",
    "some of these articles were also updated with supporting content . for at least half of them , web producers added video packages after publication , which may explain to some extent the increase in visits .    * * rebounding ( 10% ) .",
    "about 10% of the articles in our sample initially exhibit a decline in visits / minute , until a point where such decline is reversed .",
    "this `` rebound '' occurs either because of internal or external links .    in the case of internal traffic ,",
    "the traffic patterns behind these rebounding articles sometimes reflect the common newsroom practice of linking to previous coverage in more recent articles .",
    "this practice provides additional background context to readers just arriving at the story , but also helps news organizations extract additional value from articles that are otherwise statistically becoming valueless .",
    "stories that required a significant investment of resources to produce are also promoted more heavily than regular articles .",
    "we can see that in these cases , these internal links do indeed deliver readers to articles whose shelf - lives have nearly expired , when measured by homepage and social media traffic .    the articles that rebound as a result of external traffic are beneficiaries of attention directed from outside of the news organization ( e.g. a social networking site , the website of another news network , etc . ) . typically each observed burst in external web traffic",
    "can be tracked to a single source .",
    "breaking stories can also gain visits as ongoing developments drive significant additional interest .",
    "this phenomenon is evidenced , for instance , by three rebounding articles tracking hurricane sandy s descent upon the united states .    in general",
    ", we see that when news articles cover topics that stray from `` hard news '' , the article s attention profile reflects the increased variability seen in the in - depth pieces .",
    "for example , some articles ostensibly cover specific actualities , but also bridge into long - standing issues : in the u.s .",
    ", `` immigrant family in pursuit of the american dream '' and `` living the modern american dream '' stoke passions around immigration .",
    "the sometimes blurry line between reporting on immediate actualities and longer - term trends like immigration is an area of tension in journalism , one identified by galtung and ruge when they asked `` how do events become news'' ?",
    "an increased amount of social media reactions is often correlated with more traffic to online articles .",
    "this is particularly marked in the case of non - decreasing and rebounding news articles , as well as in - depth articles whose visitation patterns are more varied and less predictable than regular ( decreasing ) news articles . in this section ,",
    "we combine social media reactions with early visitation measures to provide improved predictions of ( i ) the volume of visits to an article after 7 days from its publication and ( ii ) the effective shelf - life of articles , i.e. the time during which they will receive most of their visits .",
    "we begin by fitting models to our sample data , and then explore the practicality of this approach for new data .",
    "our first goal is to determine to what extent social media reactions can improve the prediction of the overall popularity ( total number of visits ) of an article .",
    "the dependent variable that we want to describe with our models is the total number of visits after 7 days ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we use a straightforward approach to answer this question  linear regression models .",
    "we include the following variables ( described in section  [ subsec : variables ] ) as observed at the time at which the prediction is performed : number of visits ( @xmath5 ) , number of visits from link referrals ( @xmath6 ) and from `` direct '' traffic from e - mail / im ( @xmath7 ) , shares on facebook ( @xmath8 ) , twitter ( @xmath9 ) , mean number of followers of people sharing on twitter ( @xmath10 ) , entropy of tweets ( @xmath11 ) , number and fraction of unique tweets ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and fraction of corporate retweets ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we use a linear regression model that includes all first - order effects as well as second order interactions .",
    "we included second - order interactions because of the interdependency of the variables ( e.g. an article with more visits is more likely to have more social media reactions ) : @xmath15    @xmath16 .    -0.5em",

    "we log - transform @xmath18 the visits as well as the volume of social media reactions .",
    "for t=5 , 10 , 15 ,  we calculate the proportion of the explained variance of these two linear models .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : accuracy_pred_visits ] .",
    "it takes about 3 hours to be able to explain @xmath19 of the variance for in - depth articles , and the additional variables are profitable from the first minutes .",
    "after 10 - 20 minutes we observe the largest difference in our regression models ( + 0.5 in terms of @xmath20 ) .",
    "we take a closer look at the model variables after 20 minutes to identify the sources of this improvement . for this purpose",
    "we stepwise fit the model variables by aic ( akaike information criterion ) as implemented in stats.step in r. table  [ tbl : significance ] shows the reliability of the social media variables to serve as good predictor for the volume of visits after 7 days .",
    "the fraction of traffic from different sources does not appear to be a reliable predictor when all variables are used for the model ; when we reduce the model to exclusively these two variables , the traffic from e - mail / im is a more reliable predictor than the traffic from external links .",
    "social media variables , particularly the number of tweets and the entropy of the vocabulary used in them , seem to be reliable predictors for both in - depth and news articles .",

    "these articles also have more repetitive social media reactions , as most users simply repeat the news headlines without commenting on them .",
    "in - depth items portraying or analyzing a topic tend to exhibit a longer shelf - life and a richer social media response , including more content - rich tweets in terms of vocabulary entropy and fraction of unique tweets , and more shares on facebook for the same level of tweets .    by going deeper into the first few hours after publication of news articles , we found three distinctive response patterns in a roughly 80:10:10 proportion : decreasing traffic , steady or increasing traffic , and rebounding traffic .",
    "we found that there can be multiple causes for non - decreasing traffic , including the addition of new content to articles , social media reactions , and other types of referrals .",
    "we have shown that social media signals can improve by a large margin the accuracy of predictions of future visits , as well as the accuracy of predictions of article shelf - life .",
    "in particular for in - depth articles which exhibit more complex visit patterns over time , we have found that incorporating measures of the quantity and variety of social media reactions can lead to substantial gains in terms of prediction accuracy .",
    "* practical significance .",
    "* from the perspective of a news provider , while no automatic system can replace editorial judgment , understanding and predicting the life cycle of stories has three main benefits :    * in the case of news stories , knowing how the audience is interacting with an article is not just `` nice to have '' , but increasingly a critical component in delivering timely and relevant content to an ever growing online audience . * for in - depth stories , which operate on a slower news cycle , knowing when to allocate additional time and resources can significantly improve the news planning process .",
    "this is particularly useful for an emerging class of news programmes that combine live online discussions with more traditional tv coverage . * to a web producer , an article with a longer shelf - life means judicious time can be spent preparing backgrounder pieces which are valuable in providing context to a story . from a reach perspective , articles with steady or increasing levels of traffic translate into higher user engagement .",
    "our work depends on having access to a large repository of social media reactions . as more people get into social media ( e.g. twitter )",
    ", this line of work will become more relevant and will be able to produce even higher quality predictions .",
    "* limitations and future work . *",
    "we combine findings from computer science , journalism , and media studies .",
    "the research presented here is more difficult to execute than the traditional single - discipline study , but we expect interdisciplinary work on this area to become increasingly common as our media and technology continue to converge .",
    "our data gathering system collects only aggregate information and does not attempt to link actions across sessions or users across platforms ; this prevents us from separating post - read from pre - read sharing , an important distinction explored in  @xcite .",
    "another limitation of our work is that we used data from a single website , and we are in the process of gathering data from other sources in order to strengthen our claims .",
    "we also used a manual process for categorization of the article classes ( decreasing / steady / increasing / rebounding ) , and we did not attempt a comprehensive content - based classification of articles inside each class .    in this work",
    ", we used linear models and did not attempt anything more sophisticated .",
    "we do not claim that our models are the more accurate that can be built using this data , but used them to demonstrate in a clear way the importance of social media signals for the predictive tasks we undertake .",
    "better models are definitively possible , and may yield even larger gains in accuracy when incorporating social media signals .",
    "we also used a data - driven approach in which shelf - life is derived from observations .",
    "alternatively , shelf - life can be derived by fitting a visitation curve produced by a parametrized model  @xcite .",
    "this may lead to an improvement in the prediction accuracy .",
    "* reproducibility . * the data sample used for this study , including feature vectors and the categorization of articles done during the qualitative analysis , is available for research purposes upon request .",
    "a  live demo is available at http://fast.qcri.org/    * acknowledgments . *",
    "the authors wish to thank al jazeera english for the data used for this study , kiran garimella from qcri for his work in the live system , janette lehmann from yahoo !",
