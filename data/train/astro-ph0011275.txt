    "the ` merger ' hypothesis , postulating that elliptical galaxies form by spiral galaxy mergers , was first proposed by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) .",
    "this scenario has gained new impetus over the last few years by both numerical simulations ( e.g. barnes 1992 ; hernquist 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) and observational studies , suggesting that the properties of merger remnants are consistent with those of ellipticals ( e.g. toomre 1977 ; schweizer et al .",
    "1990 ; casoli et al .",
    "1991 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ; georgakakis , forbes & norris 2000 ) .",
    "however , one of the long standing drawbacks of the ` merger ' hypothesis is the excess globular clusters ( gcs ) per unit starlight around ellipticals compared to spirals ( van den bergh 1984 ) . to overcome this problem schweizer ( 1987 ) and",
    "ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) suggested that the starburst activity usually experienced during gas - rich mergers will form new gcs and thus increase their number compared to their progenitors .",
    "indeed , there is accumulating observational evidence supporting this scenario in on - going mergers ( e.g. lutz 1991 ; whitmore et al . 1993 ; whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; schweizer 1996 ; miller et al .",
    "1997 ; zepf et al .",
    "1999 ; forbes & hau 2000 ) .",
    "however , the situation in ellitpical galaxies ( the eventual product of mergers ) is less clear .",
    "although many ellipticals have been observed to have bimodal colour distributions , when examined in detail their gc properties do not match those from the merger picture ( forbes et al .",
    "outstanding questions include whether the newly formed gcs survive and whether the final gc system resembles that of typical ( old ) ellipticals .",
    "probing the gc properties in intermediate age merger - remnants ( 15gyrs ) may be of key importance for addressing these issues . indeed",
    ", such young ellipticals may provide the link between on - going mergers and relaxed ellipticals .",
    "for example , a sample of merger  remnants spanning a range of ages will allow study of the chronological development of the system s specific frequency ( measuring the number of globular clusters per unit starlight ) in comparison with that of evolved ellipticals .",
    "young ellipticals are also expected to have two distinct gc populations with different colour and magnitude distributions . by exploiting these differences one can attempt to age - date the newly formed gcs , which in turn can be compared to the time since the gaseous merger .",
    "indeed , studies of the dynamically young proto - ellipticals ngc1700 and ngc3610 have shown the presence of bimodality in their colour distributions ( whitmore et al .",
    "1997 ; brown et al . 2000 ) .",
    "also the age of the new gcs , although model dependent , is found to be similar to estimates for the galaxy age based on spectroscopic or dynamical arguments .    in this paper",
    "we study the globular cluster system of the elliptical galaxy ngc6702 .",
    "lauer ( 1985 ) found a dust lane in the centre of ngc6702 indicating a recent gaseous merger event .",
    "this galaxy is also relatively luminous at far - infrared wavelengths compared to other elliptical galaxies , with @xmath6 ( wiklind et al .",
    "terlevich & forbes ( 2000 ) have estimated a spectroscopic age and metallicity of about 2gyrs and @xmath7=+0.5}$ ] respectively for ngc6702 suggesting that it is a young elliptical .",
    "the main observational properties of ngc6702 are given in table [ tab_0 ] .    additionally , according to the ned database the nearest galaxy projected on the sky that is either brighter or no more than 2 magnitudes fainter , than ngc6702 is ngc6703 at a projected distance of 10arcmin .",
    "however , as ngc6702 has a recession velocity of @xmath8 and ngc6703 has @xmath9 they are actually separated by some 30mpc assuming no peculiar motions .",
    "the nearest galaxy with a similar recession velocity is ngc6711 ( @xmath10 ) with a separation of @xmath11arcmin or over 2mpc .",
    "other galaxies listed by ned are more than 2 magnitudes fainter than ngc6702 .",
    "thus ngc6702 is an example of an isolated elliptical galaxy with no comparable galaxies within 2mpc .",
    "such galaxies are fairly rare and hence their evolutionary history is of some interest . in particular , ellipticals in low density environments are interesting within the hierarchical merger framework as they are expected to have assembled much more recently than their cluster counterparts ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) . any merger would be expected to have occurred in the more recent past and involved progenitors that have largely processed gas into stars .    in section [ sec_obs ]",
    "the observations , data reduction and the isophotal properties of ngc6702 are presented .",
    "section [ sec_sel ] describes the candidate gc selection , while section [ sec_res ] presents our results which are discussed in section [ sec_disc ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec_conc ] summarises our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath12 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "broad - band imaging of ngc6702 in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters was carried out at the keck - ii telescope on 1999 august 17 , using the the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "the lris instrument , equipped with a tek @xmath13 ccd , is mounted on the cassegrain focus providing a @xmath14 imaging scale and a @xmath15 field  of  view .",
    "the total exposure time in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters was 3600 , 1800 , and 1200sec respectively , segregated into three separate integrations of 1200 , 600 and 400sec respectively .",
    "the seeing at the time of the observations varied between 0.8 to 1arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced following standard procedures , using iraf tasks .",
    "the reduced images are found to be flat to better than @xmath16 .",
    "the final @xmath1-band image of ngc6702 is shown in figure [ fig_image ] .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "the photometric accuracy , estimated using these standard stars , is @xmath17mag in all three bands .",
    "we adopt a galactic extinction in the ngc6702 direction of @xmath18 , taken from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) . assuming a standard reddening curve ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , we correct each magnitude for galactic extinction using the values @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21mag .      the @xmath0-band surface brightness profile , @xmath22 , of ngc6702 is plotted in figure [ fig_prof ] .",
    "this has been determined by fitting ellipses to the galaxy intensity profile using the isophote task within stsdas . during the ellipse fitting process",
    "the centre of the galaxy was kept fixed and a @xmath23 clipping algorithm was employed .",
    "also , bright objects as well as the central saturated parts of the galaxy , were masked out .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) and ellipticity ( @xmath24 ) were fitted at each radius , until s / n constraints terminated the fitting process at low surface brightness . for ngc6702 this occurs at an equivalent radius @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the semi - major axis ) . beyond",
    "that radius the position angle and ellipticity were kept constant .",
    "the sky level was determined using the method described by goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "although the isophotes of elliptical galaxies are well approximated by ellipses , deviations at the few per cent level are common .",
    "such deviations are often quantified by the 4th sine and cosine amplitudes ( s4 and c4 respectively ) of the fourier transform of the galaxy intensity at a given radius .",
    "the standard interpretation of the residual c4 terms is that they indicate either the presence of a weak underlying disk if positive or boxiness if negative .",
    "however , it has been emphasised that both c4 and s4 terms should be considered when estimating the isophotal shape of galaxies ( franx et al .",
    "1989 ; peletier et al . 1990 ; goodfrooij et al .",
    "for example , the presence of a disk , bar or ring with a significant position angle twist relative to the elliptical galaxy semi - major axis is expected to give both positive and negative c4 and/or s4 terms , depending on its orientation .",
    "consequently , in the case of such projection effects we expect s4 terms to be significant .",
    "figure [ fig_prof1 ] plots the ellipticity , position angle as well as c4 and s4 terms as a function of radius for ngc6702 in the @xmath0-band .",
    "similar trends are apparent for the @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands .",
    "the c4 term is negative at small galactocentric distances , indicating boxiness , i.e. excess light at 45@xmath28 relative to the semi - major axis .",
    "this is partly due to the presence of the dust lane in the core of ngc6702 ( lauer 1985 ) lying perpendicular to the semi - major axis and extending out to @xmath29 .",
    "the s4 term is also non - zero within the same range of @xmath30 , albeit with a smaller amplitude .",
    "masking out the dust lane reduces the amplitude of both the c4 and s4 terms .",
    "these terms are also non - zero ( s4 positive and c4 negative ) at @xmath31 indicating boxiness . at larger distances ( @xmath32 )",
    "both the c4 and s4 deviate significantly from the elliptical symmetry , but this is likely to be an artifact arising from the low s / n at these radii .      to detect sources superimposed on ngc6702 we subtract the galaxy light profile using a median filter technique .",
    "firstly , the reduced image for each filter is smoothed using a median rectangular filter with a size of 40 pixels .",
    "the smoothed image is then subtracted from the original frame and the resulting image is subsequently used for source extraction and photometry .",
    "the sources in the reduced frames were extracted using the sextractor package ( version 2.1.0 ; bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the main input parameters are the detection threshold , given as a multiple of the sky variance ( @xmath33 ) and the minimum area in pixels for an object to be extracted .",
    "after considerable experimentation , we adopted a threshold of 2.5@xmath34 and a minimum area of 1015pixels ( @xmath350.50.7arcsec@xmath36 ) .",
    "this choice of values minimises the number of spurious detections , while ensuring that faint objects are successfully extracted .",
    "a total of 1455 , 1456 and 1494 sources were extracted form the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 frames respectively .",
    "the photometric catalogues generated for each waveband were then matched , resulting in a total of 939 common detections in all three filters , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this source list is referred to as the matched catalogue . using this catalogue we performed photometry using the phot task .",
    "after a curve  of  growth analysis on several sources an aperture of 8 pixels radius was employed with the background estimated from an annulus of 15 to 20 pixels around each source . for unresolved sources the 8 pixels radius aperture magnitude is close to total .",
    "the completeness limit in a given filter is estimated by adding artificial point sources of different magnitudes to the original image , using mkobjects task .",
    "then we attempt to recover the artificial objects using sextractor package , with the same parameter settings as with those adopted for the real data .",
    "a total of 1500 point sources were added to a given filter frame . to avoid overcrowding the frame ,",
    "artificial sources are added in groups of 150 and the process is repeated 10 times .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig_complete ] , plotting the fraction of recovered objects as a function of magnitude in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters respectively .",
    "the @xmath37 completeness limits in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters are found to be @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40mag respectively",
    ". the mean photometric error at these magnitude limits is @xmath41mag for all three filters .",
    "we have also investigated variations of the completeness limits due to the increased background close to the galaxy centre . a method similar to that described above",
    "was adopted , with artificial point sources being added within successive elliptical rings centred on ngc6702 and having the same mean ellipticity and position angle as the galaxy ( @xmath42 , pa=145@xmath43 ) .",
    "the effect of galaxy background was found to be small except for @xmath44 .",
    "however , this is close to the saturated region of the ccd images which is masked out in our analysis .",
    "therefore , the lower sensitivity close to the galaxy center will not affect the results from this study .",
    "globular cluster candidates are selected from the matched catalogue on the basis of their expected range in colour and magnitude . in particular",
    ", the full range of possible globular cluster metallicities is @xmath45}<+1.0 $ ] . using the colour  metallicity relation of couture et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the above mentioned metallicity interval corresponds to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "figures [ fig_bv_bi ] and [ fig_bv_vi ] plot the @xmath48 and @xmath49 colours against @xmath50 respectively , for the objects in the matched catalogue .",
    "the horizontal lines in these figures represent the above mentioned @xmath48 and @xmath49 colour cutoffs .",
    "also shown are the regions of the parameter space occupied by the galactic gcs ( harris 1996 ; corrected for galactic reddening ) .",
    "the accepted range of @xmath50 colour for globular cluster selection is chosen to span the @xmath50 colour range of the galactic gcs . additionally , using the population synthesis models of worthey ( 1994 ) we find that the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 colours of a stellar population of a given age get redder with increasing metallicity in the direction indicated by the arrows in figures [ fig_bv_bi ] and [ fig_bv_vi ] .",
    "globular cluster candidates are selected on the basis of their photometric colours if they lie within the regions indicated in figures [ fig_bv_bi ] and [ fig_bv_vi ] , adopting a @xmath51 uncertainty on each colour given by the phot software .",
    "a total of 374 candidate gcs are selected .",
    "these objects are then visually inspected to discard resolved sources , likely to be galaxies , and sources lying near hot pixels .",
    "the final list consists of 205 candidate gcs .",
    "although visual inspection is not an objective method for identifying point sources , we believe that to the first approximation we successfully eliminate background galaxies from the gc catalogue .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig_svsm ] plotting an estimator of the spatial extent of a source as a function of @xmath2-band magnitude .",
    "the size of a source is estimated by the difference between the @xmath2-band magnitude measured within 3 and 8arcsec radius apertures .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig_svsm ] that visually classified resolved sources are separated from point - like objects , particularly at bright magnitudes . at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath52mag ) , however , the visual classification scheme becomes more uncertain .",
    "also note that point sources brighter than @xmath53mag are likely to have saturated cores .",
    "additionally , we apply a bright magnitude cutoff set to @xmath3mag brighter than the most luminous milky way gc ( @xmath54-cen ; @xmath55mag ) , shifted to the distance of ngc6702 .",
    "this is because ngc6702 has a young stellar component , with an estimated spectroscopic age of @xmath56gyrs ( terlevich & forbes 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , ngc6702 may possess a number of young metal ",
    "rich gcs , expected to be significantly brighter than the old metal  poor gcs . for example , the worthey ( 1994 ) models predict a 2.0gyrs old stellar population to be brighter by as much as 1.5mag in the @xmath2-band compared to an old metal  poor stellar population ( 15gyrs , @xmath57=-1.5 $ ] ) assumed to be representative of the milky way gcs .",
    "the bright magnitude cutoffs are thus set to @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60mag .",
    "sources brighter than this are almost certainly stars . in the rest of the paper , unless otherwise stated , we consider gcs brighter than the @xmath37 completeness limit for point sources . therefore , the magnitude range of the candidate gc sample is @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63mag .",
    "the colour and magnitude selected and visually inspected sample comprises a total of 151 gc candidates .",
    "it should be noted that including gcs brighter than the @xmath64 completeness limit for point sources does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "figure [ fig_cm ] shows the colour - magnitude diagram of all the colour selected and visually inspected gc candidates before applying any magnitude cuts .",
    "objects have a wide range of colours but there is some evidence for two concentrations at @xmath65 and @xmath66mag .",
    "this will be further discussed in section [ sec_res ] .",
    "although we attempt to minimise the fraction of foreground stars and background galaxies in the final gc sample , it is likely that a number of contaminating sources are also selected .    the number counts and colour distribution of foreground stars are estimated using the model developed by bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) . in this model",
    "the galaxy consists of both a disk and a spheroid component from which the distribution of stars in the @xmath0 and @xmath1-bands as well as the @xmath50 colour distribution are calculated .",
    "to predict both the star counts in the @xmath2-band and the @xmath48 and @xmath49 colour distributions we use the empirical tight relation between the @xmath50 and @xmath49 colours for stars ( bessel 1990 ) .",
    "we predict about 120 stars within the field  of  view in the magnitude range @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69mag .",
    "however , the colour selection ( assuming a @xmath51 uncertainty of 0.2mags ) eliminates the majority of stars from the final catalogue .",
    "indeed , the model of bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) , after both magnitude and colour selection , predicts a total of about @xmath70 stars in the final gc sample ( total of 151 sources ) .",
    "therefore , the star contamination is about @xmath71 .    to quantify the contamination of the final gc sample by background galaxies we should first estimate the completeness limits for galaxies at different wavebands . since galaxies are resolved sources , their completeness limit is expected to be at brighter magnitudes to that of point sources ( e.g. gcs in ngc6702 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_bcounts ] plots the number counts for all the sources detected in our @xmath0-band frame ( total of 1455 ) .",
    "also shown is the star count prediction from the model of bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) .",
    "the difference between the total observed source counts and the predicted star counts in a given magnitude bin estimates , to the first approximation , the number of background galaxies detected in our field ( here we ignore the contribution from gcs to the counts ) .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig_bcounts ] are the @xmath0-band galaxy counts from metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1995 ) .",
    "it is clear that the predicted galaxy counts in our field are in good agreement with those from metcalfe et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1995 ) to the magnitude @xmath72 and then decline due to incompleteness .",
    "we estimate our @xmath0-band galaxy catalogue to be about @xmath73 and @xmath74 complete at @xmath75 and @xmath76mag respectively .",
    "figures [ fig_vcounts ] and [ fig_icounts ] are similar to figure [ fig_bcounts ] for the @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands respectively . from these figures , we estimate our @xmath1 and @xmath2-band galaxy catalogues to be @xmath73 complete at @xmath77 and @xmath78mag respectively .    ignoring gcs",
    "when calculating the number of galaxies within the field  of  view at @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2bands , overestimates the galaxy numbers at faint magnitudes .",
    "the above mentioned completeness limits are conservative estimates .    to quantify the contamination of the gc sample due to background galaxies we use the multiwavelength ( @xmath79 ) faint galaxy catalogue of lilly , cowie & gardner ( 1991 ) complete to @xmath80 .",
    "the ab system is defined as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the flux cgs units .",
    "the transformations from the ab system are : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( lilly , cowie & gardner 1991 ) . using this galaxy sample",
    "we predict a total of @xmath86 galaxies with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89mag after converting to our magnitude system and scaling to the area of the lris field  of  view ( @xmath90arcmin@xmath36 ) . taking into account the galaxy incompleteness of our sample , estimated from figures [ fig_bcounts][fig_icounts ] ,",
    "we predict a total of @xmath91 galaxies within the above mentioned magnitude limits .",
    "colour selection , using the aperture colours of lilly , cowie & gardner ( 1991 ) and assuming a @xmath51 uncertainty of 0.2mags , reduces the number of contaminating background galaxies in our candidate gc sample to @xmath92 .    however , as demonstrated in figure [ fig_svsm ] , visual inspection is efficient in removing extended sources from the sample especially at bright magnitudes .",
    "indeed , a total of @xmath93 resolved sources with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96mag have been identified , leaving about @xmath97 unidentified galaxies within the final gc sample .",
    "this corresponds to a contamination of the gc candidate catalogue ( total of 151 ) by galaxies of @xmath98 .",
    "we stress that this fraction is an upper limit . in particular , we simulated galaxy bulges following @xmath99law profile , with absolute luminosity and effective radius of @xmath100=21.0mag and @xmath101kpc respectively , typical of @xmath102 ellipticals .",
    "we found that only half of them are detected to the limit @xmath103mag and this fraction drops to @xmath104 at @xmath105mag .",
    "moreover , disk - dominated galaxies will be missed by the detection algorithm at even brighter magnitudes .",
    "these surface brightness effects are likely to be significantly less severe in the deep surveys used to determine the galaxy counts at faint magnitudes .",
    "indeed these surveys have effective exposure times as much as 10 times longer than those used here and are therefore , specifically designed to detect sources at faint magnitudes .",
    "since bulges and compact galaxies account for less than @xmath106 of the galaxy population at faint magnitude limits ( elson & santiago 1996 ) , we anticipate the galaxy contamination of our final candidate gc sample to be much less than @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath48 colour distribution for the final gc sample is plotted in figure [ fig_hist_bi ] .",
    "there is evidence for bimodality with the peaks of the distribution at @xmath108 and @xmath109 . indeed the kmm statistical test ( ashman et al .",
    "1994 ) rejects the single gaussian model at a confidence level better than @xmath110 , giving peaks at @xmath111 and 2.16 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that this result is obtained after clipping objects with @xmath112mag , likely to be background galaxies ( 3 out of 151 ; see figure [ fig_hist_bi1 ] ) .",
    "however , this is not expected to artificially increase the likelihood of the two gaussian fit . in particular ,",
    "ashman et al . ( 1994 ) argue that clipping of the data before applying the kmm test is sometimes desirable to remove background contamination .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig_hist_bi ] is the reddening  corrected colour distribution of galactic gcs that comprise old metal  poor gcs .",
    "the blue peak of ngc6702 gcs lies close to the milky way gc distribution .",
    "figure [ fig_hist_bi1 ] compares the candidate gc @xmath48 colour distribution with the colours of contaminating stars and galaxies ( after being selected on the basis of their magnitudes and colours ) predicted in the previous section .",
    "it is clear that foreground stars do not significantly modify the observed candidate gc colour distribution .",
    "background galaxies , however , have a larger effect on the observed colour distribution , having colours similar to those of the red gc peak .",
    "nevertheless , the fraction of contaminating galaxies within the sample is expected to be sufficiently small that it will not significantly modify the position of the peaks of the gc colour distribution .",
    "we further investigate this by subtracting the predicted galaxy colour distribution from that of the gc candidates in figure [ fig_hist_bi1 ] .",
    "the kmm statistical test is then applied to the resulting distribution .",
    "a single gaussian model is rejected at a confidence level better than @xmath110 , while the peaks of the bimodal distribution are at @xmath113 and 2.27mag respectively . although both peaks are redder than those recovered using the full candidate gc colour distribution , the difference is sufficiently small that does not alter any of our conclusions .",
    "figure [ fig_hist_vi ] plots the @xmath49 colour histogram of both the ngc6702 gc candidates and the galactic gcs .",
    "there is no strong evidence for bimodality , with the kmm test finding no improvement of the two - group fit over a single gaussian .",
    "this seems surprising since the @xmath48 colour distribution shows clear evidence for bimodality .",
    "it is likely that the absence of bimodality in figure [ fig_hist_vi ] is due to the smaller wavelength baseline of @xmath49 compared to the @xmath48 colour , providing less metallicity leverage .",
    "the expected difference between the peaks in @xmath49 is smaller ( i.e. @xmath114mag ; see next section ) than that in the @xmath48 histogram and therefore random photometric errors can more easily smear out any bimodality .",
    "contamination of the gc candidate sample by stars and galaxies may also affect the significance of the detection of bimodality in the @xmath49 colour distribution .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig_hist_vi1 ] , plotting the @xmath49 colour distribution of contaminating stars and galaxies ( after being selected on the basis of their magnitudes and colours ) .      to constrain the age and metallicity of ngc6702 gc system",
    "we employ a method similar to that developed by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that uses the colour - magnitude relation of gcs .",
    "the basic assumptions of the method are discussed in detail by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in brief",
    ", it is assumed that the gcs comprise two distinct sub - populations of different age and metallicity but with the same initial mass functions .",
    "an additional assumption is that both sub - populations have similar numbers of gcs .",
    "the older population is taken to have properties similar to those of the milky way gcs and therefore consists of old ( 15gyrs ) metal  poor ( @xmath7=-1.5}$ ] ) gcs .",
    "the younger population is formed at a later stage of the evolution of the galaxy , through either a merger event ( e.g. ashman & zepf 1992 ) or a secondary _ in situ _ star - formation burst ( forbes et al .",
    "the young gcs , assumed to be metal ",
    "rich , are initially bluer than the old metal  poor ones but become redder after about 12gyrs .",
    "similarly , the newly formed gcs are much brighter than the pre - existing metal  poor population but become fainter at later stages as they evolve passively .",
    "therefore , the difference between the colours and magnitudes of the two gc populations can be used to constrain the age of the new gcs .    here",
    "we employ the models of worthey ( 1994 ) to predict the colour and magnitude difference of a young gc population relative to an old ( 15gyrs ) metal  poor ( @xmath7=-1.5}$ ] ) population .",
    "the predicted colours of this old stellar population are @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the model predictions for the @xmath48 colour against both @xmath0 and @xmath2 magnitudes are shown in figures [ fig_worthy_b ] and [ fig_worthy_i ] respectively .",
    "for ngc6702 the difference @xmath117 between the colours of the two gc populations is taken as the difference between the peaks of the bimodal @xmath48 distribution in figure [ fig_hist_bi ] .",
    "the blue peak in that figure is assumed to correspond to the old metal ",
    "poor population .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the blue peak overlaps with the milky way gcs fairly well .",
    "the peak colour difference from the kmm statistical test is @xmath118 , where the error is estimated assuming an uncertainty of 0.07mag in defining the peaks of the bimodal distribution .",

    ", we repeat our calculations using the models developed by bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) and vazdekis et al . ( 1996 ) with a salpeter imf .",
    "both models predict an age of about 2gyrs for the recently formed gc population .",
    "the predicted metallicity of @xmath7>0.5}$ ] is higher than that from the worthey model .",
    "despite , the discrepancies , it is clear that all three models used here predict that the blue gcs sub - population is relatively young with a supersolar metallicity .    additionally , assuming an age of 3gyrs and [ fe / h]=0.5 for the red gcs , the worthey ( 1994 ) models predict a @xmath49 colour difference between the two gc subpopulations of @xmath114mag .",
    "as discussed in the previous section such a small colour difference is difficult to detect with the present dataset .",
    "we study the surface density profile , @xmath126 , of the ngc6702 gcs using all the sources detected in the @xmath0-band to @xmath127mag ( total of 1237 ) , the @xmath37 completeness limit for point sources .",
    "we use the @xmath0-band detections instead of the colour selected gc sample because the selection criteria ( i.e. completeness limits ) are easier to quantify and do not depend on the gc colours .",
    "the sample is binned into elliptical rings centred on ngc6702 and having the same mean ellipticity and position angle as the galaxy ( @xmath42 , pa=@xmath128 ) .",
    "the counts in each bin are corrected for geometric incompleteness due to foreground saturated stars , bad columns and the limited size of the field  of  view . additionally , we mask out the central saturated part of ngc6702 for radii @xmath129 .",
    "the correction for magnitude incompleteness to the counts in individual bins was found to be small ( @xmath130 ) and was ignored .",
    "the density profile is plotted in figure [ fig_den_prof](a ) .",
    "the background surface density level , @xmath131 , was determined by combining the counts within the outermost three bins lying at @xmath132 ( corresponding to galactocentric distances @xmath133kpc ) where the density profile reaches a constant level .",
    "we find @xmath134 ( assuming poisson statistics ) or @xmath135 sources over the lris field  of  view of 31.2arcmin@xmath36 ( after applying geometrical corrections ) .",
    "the total number of objects to @xmath127mag is 1237 and therefore the number of candidate gc is estimated to be 123@xmath13656 ( poisson statistics ) . in section [ sec_sel ]",
    "we found a total of 151 candidate gcs , selected on the basis of their colours and magnitudes in the range @xmath61mag .",

    "this slope for the gc system of ngc6702 is consistent with that for other galaxies of a similar magnitude ( forbes et al .",
    "1997 ) . also shown in figure [ fig_den_prof](b ) is the @xmath0-band surface brightness profile of ngc6702 .",
    "it is clear that the starlight of ngc6702 drops more steeply than the gc density profile as is often seen in other galaxies ( harris 1991 ; durrell et al .",
    "this is often attributed to further dissipative collapse of the host galaxy after the older gcs had formed and before the halo stars formed ( e.g. harris 1986 ) .",

    "previously , we found that the number of gcs to the limiting magnitude @xmath0=26mag is 123@xmath13656 . therefore integrating over the entire area of the luminosity function",
    "we find @xmath146 .",
    "this implies @xmath147 , assuming @xmath148mag for ngc6702 .",

    "we assume that the total number of gcs is conserved and that the change in @xmath149 is due to passive evolution of the host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , we assume that during the most recent major star - formation event , that took place about 2gyrs ago , @xmath104 of the ngc6702 mass ( see section [ sec_disc ] below ) has been converted into metal  rich ( [ fe / h]=+0.5 ) stars .",
    "after 10gyrs this new stellar population will fade in the @xmath1-band by @xmath150mag ( worthey 1994 ) , corresponding to @xmath151 .",
    "harris , harris & mclaughlin ( 1998 ) found a mean of @xmath152 for large ellipticals in the virgo , fornax and the ngc5846 group ( excluding cd galaxies ) .",
    "however , exclusion of bright cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) results in a mean @xmath153 , in better agreement , although somewhat larger , with the estimated @xmath5 for ngc6702 after 10gyrs .",

    "we calculate an upper limit for the ngc6702 @xmath139 after 10gyrs by assuming the extreme scenario where as much as @xmath64 of the galaxy mass has been turned into stars .",
    "we estimate a fading of @xmath154mag ( worthey 1994 ) within 10gyrs , corresponding to an upper limit of @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ngc6702 @xmath139 , although lower than that of bright cluster ellipticals , it is likely to be similar to that of ` normal ' ( old ) present - day ellipticals ( excluding bcgs ) within the next 10gyrs . the calculations above are also consistent with suggestions that galaxy interactions and mergers although unable to account for large @xmath149 galaxies , may explain the low values of @xmath156 in relatively isolated ellipticals ( elmegreen 1999 ) .",

    "it is clear that there are quite a few similarities between the two galaxies .",
    "both of them have similar optical luminosities and deviate from the fundamental plane in the sense of having younger ages on average ( forbes , ponman & brown 1998 ) .",

    "the central stars appear to be of high metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1650.5 ) with supersolar [ mg / fe ] abundance .",
    "supersolar abundances have been the source of much debate in the literature but probably indicate either a rapid star formation time - scale or an imf skewed towards massive stars . both galaxies have radial velocity to velocity dispersion ratios , @xmath166 , indicating that they are anisotropic rotators .",
    "bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have suggested that the last major merger for anisotropic galaxies involved relatively little gas , i.e. the progenitors were largely stellar . in the case of ngc6702 and ngc1700 there",
    "must have been sufficient gas to support the central starburst and associated cluster formation .",
    "the similarities above also suggest a similar formation mechanism for these galaxies .",
    "moreover , our analysis above indicates the presence of two gc populations in ngc6702 with different metallicities and ages .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to estimate the formation efficiency of the young ( red ; @xmath167 ) gc subpopulation , assuming they formed during the most recent star - formation burst , and compare it to that of stars formed in the same burst .",
    "a robust estimator of the gc formation efficiency is the ratio of the total gc mass to the total baryonic galaxy mass . for this calculation",
    "we assume a typical gc mass of @xmath168 ( harris , harris & mclaughlin 1998 ) and a mass  to  light ratio for ngc6702 @xmath169 , typical to that of ellipticals ( faber & gallagher 1979 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) . we have identified a total of 88 red gcs ( @xmath170 ) to the limit @xmath171mag , assumed to be the newly formed metal ",
    "rich gcs of ngc6702 .",
    "we adopt a gaussian luminosity function for this gc subpopulation with parameters similar to those used in section [ sec_sn ] ( @xmath143mag and @xmath144 ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , since the blue and red gc subpopulations of ngc6702 in section [ sec_age ] have a similar @xmath0-band magnitude distribution within few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "integrating over the entire luminosity function , assuming a completeness limit for our sample @xmath171mag , we estimate a total of 970 red gcs .",
    "thus , the total mass of the red gcs is @xmath172 .",
    "the total baryonic mass in stars of ngc6702 , estimated using its @xmath1-band luminosity and the assumed mass  to  light ratio , is found to be @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , we estimate that @xmath174 of the ngc6702 mass has been turned into gcs during the most recent star - formation event , which is lower compared to recent estimates for the gc formation efficiency of 0.25% ( harris , harris & mclaughlin 1998 ; mclaughlin 1999 ) .",
    "it should be noted that this calculation assumes that the estimated baryonic mass in stars represents the total mass of the system , i.e. most of initial gas has been used for star - formation .",
    "elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , argue that gcs represent about @xmath175 of the total galaxy star - formation .",
    "therefore , for the gc formation efficiency of @xmath174 we expect that @xmath176 of the total ngc6702 mass has turned into field stars ( not in bound clusters ) during the most recent star - formation event .",
    "is our estimate of the mass in new stars ( i.e. 8% of the total ) consistent with the spectral line indices in the central r@xmath177/8 region ( gonzalez et al .",
    "1993 ) ? if we assume that the new stars formed with a metallicity of [ fe / h]=0.5 , and that the old stars ( representing 92% of the central stellar mass ) have solar metallicity and an age of 15gyrs , then the new stars would have to be slightly younger than 1gyr old .",
    "assuming a time since the starburst of @xmath3gyrs and applying that to the new stars , their mass fraction would have to be increased to @xmath178 .",
    "furthermore , if the galaxy reveals evidence for a young stellar population outside of the central region this will also point towards a large mass fraction ( see also trager 1997 ) .",
    "clearly there are large uncertainties involved in the above arguments , but there is some agreement between the mass fraction of young stars estimated independently using spectroscopic line indices and the properties of the ngc6702 gc system .",
    "moreover , it seems clear that a large fraction of new stars formed in ngc6702 a few gyrs ago . in the merger context",
    ", it implies a high gas fraction for the progenitors and hence a highly dissipational event .",
    "this is contrary to the claims of bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) that anisotropic galaxies ( such as ngc6702 and ngc1700 ) formed by largely _",
    "dissipationless _ mergers .",
    "next , we compare the fraction of galaxy starlight in newly formed dense clusters relative to that of young field stars . to do that we add the luminosities of the red gcs ( total of 88 ; @xmath179 ) and then divide by the luminosity of the _ young _ stellar population of ngc6702 .",
    "we note that estimating the total gc luminosity by extrapolating to the gc luminosity function will not modify our results , since the main contribution to the luminosity is from bright systems .",
    "therefore , adding the red gc luminosities is a simple approximation that is sufficient for the purposes of the present study .",
    "additionally , in our calculation we assume that @xmath104 by mass of the ngc6702 stars are young ( 2gyrs ) and metal rich ( [ fe / h]=0.5 ) , while the remaining @xmath180 of the mass is in old ( 15gyrs ) metal poor ( [ fe / h]=1.5 ) stars . using the mass  to  light ratios of the above stellar populations predicted by the models of worthey ( 1994 ) we estimate that @xmath181 of the total ngc6702 @xmath0-band light originates in newly formed stars , i.e. @xmath182 .",
    "consequently , we estimate @xmath183 , i.e. @xmath184 of the young star @xmath0-band luminosity originates in bound clusters formed during the most recent star - formation event .",
    "this is much lower than the estimates in recent mergers which have shown that as much as @xmath106 of the blue galaxy light originates from gcs ( zepf et al .",
    "1999 ; meurer 1995 ) . however , the main contribution to the integrated starlight in bound clusters in these systems is from young luminous clusters , the nature of which is under debate .",
    "in particular , it is still unclear whether these objects are proto - globular clusters that will evolve into _ bona - fide _ gcs ( brodie et al .",
    "1998 ) or are luminous open clusters that will be destroyed by dynamical evolution ( van den bergh 1995 ) . indeed ,",
    "in older merger remants , like ngc7252 , the fraction of light in bound clusters is somewhat lower than @xmath106 ( zepf et al .",
    "moreover , van den bergh ( 1994 ) noted that gcs account for about @xmath184 of the total halo luminosity of both the milky way and the lmc , in good agreement with our estimate for ngc6702 .",
    "clearly , the young elliptical galaxy ngc6702 ( and also ngc1700 ) is at an interesting evolutionary stage for further study of its gc system .",
    "direct measurement of individual gc metallicities with 8 - 10 m class telescopes would confirm ( or refute ) the inferred supersolar metallicities for the new gcs and hence their age estimates .",
    "we note that the magnitude differences @xmath119 and @xmath120 in section [ sec_age ] , used to constrain the gc age and metallicity , are hard to define and would benefit from deeper imaging .",
    "deeper imaging studies would also help determine the gc luminosity function ( e.g. gaussian or power law ) to explore possible destruction mechanisms and would allow a detailed study of the radial distribution of the gc subpopulations .",
    "we have carried out @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-band photometric observations of the elliptical galaxy ngc6702 to explore its gc system .",
    "the gc candidates are selected on the basis of their colour , magnitude and morphology .",
    "we find strong evidence that the @xmath48 colour distribution of gc candidates is bimodal with the blue peak having a colour similar to that of the old metal  poor galactic gcs .",
    "assuming that the blue gc subpopulation is indeed old and metal  poor , we estimate that the red gcs have an age of 25gyrs and super - solar metallicity . despite the large uncertainties ,",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopically estimated age and metallcity of about 2gyrs and 0.5 respectively for the galaxy .",
    "thus the red gcs in ngc6702 are consistent with having formed during the most recent starburst , likely to have been triggered by a merger or an accretion event , a few gyrs earlier .",
    "additionally , we find a specific frequency for the ngc6702 gc system of @xmath147 .",
    "we predict that passive evolution of the ngc6702 stellar population formed during the most recent star - formation event will increase the ngc6702 specific frequency to @xmath185 within 10gyrs , in reasonable agreement with the mean for present - day ellipticals , excluding the largest cluster ellipticals . finally , using the ngc6702 gc properties and making reasonable assumptions about the gc formation efficiency , we estimate the mass fraction of newly formed stars during the most recent star - formation event . we find reasonable agreement with",
