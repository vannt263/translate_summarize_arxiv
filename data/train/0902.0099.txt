    "since the discovery of superdeformation ( sd ) in @xmath1dy two decades ago @xcite , nuclear sd has been in the focus of attention of the nuclear structure community ; it has been discovered in different mass regions and extensively studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "new phenomena such as identical bands @xcite were discovered , and rich variety of experimental data allowed to test modern theoretical tools under extreme conditions of large deformation and fast rotation .",
    "it was known for a long time from harmonic oscillator studies @xcite that even more elongated shapes , called as hyperdeformed ( hd ) and characterized by the semi - axis ratio of around 3:1 , are possible .",
    "the existence of such stable shapes was later confirmed in the macroscopic+microscopic ( mm ) method @xcite .",
    "theoretical results on the states located in third ( hd ) minima are also available in self - consistent hartree - fock+bogoliubov ( hfb ) approaches based on the skyrme and gogny forces ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) , and relativistic mean field approach @xcite .",
    "however , these results are restricted to spin zero states , which are difficult to measure in experiment . to our knowledge",
    ", the description of the hd states at high spin within the self - consistent approach has been attempted only in @xmath2cd @xcite [ within the cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) method ] and in four @xmath3 mass nuclei @xcite [ within the cranked skyrme - hartree - fock approach ] .",
    "the general feature of all these calculations is the fact that the semi - axis ratio of the hd shapes is less than 3:1 @xcite .",
    "let us mention two examples of such studies : one at spin zero , another at high spin . in actinide nuclei ,",
    "the hd states are so - called third minima states around @xmath4th @xcite . in these nuclei ,",
    "the second saddle point is split , leading to the excited reflection - symmetric and reflection asymmetric configurations with large quadrupole and octupole deformations , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the density distribution at the hd minimum resembles a di - nucleus consisting of a nearly - spherical nucleus around the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath7sn and a well - deformed fragment from the neutron - rich @xmath8 region @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to study the hd states at low spin in experiment . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", one should use the fact that the larger moment of inertia connected with the larger deformation drives the nucleus towards larger deformations with increasing angular momentum ; the hd minimum is thus favored by rotation and becomes ultimately yrast at high spin .",
    "for example , cranked nilsson - strutinsky calculations suggested the existence of very elongated high - spin minima in nuclei around @xmath9yb @xcite .",
    "these hd bands are expected to become yrast at spin around 80@xmath10 .    on the experimental side , very little",
    "was known about hyperdeformation apart from some indications of this phenomenon at low spin in the uranium nuclei @xcite and light nuclei like @xmath11c @xcite and the observation of the hd ridge structures at high spin in the @xmath12 mass region @xcite .",
    "recent observation of the very extended shapes in @xmath2cd @xcite , strongly motivated by earlier calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and more recent studies of ref .",
    "@xcite , has renewed interest in the study of hyperdeformation at high spin .",
    "although the hyperdeformed nature of the bands in this nucleus has not been confirmed in the subsequent cranked relativistic mean field analysis of ref .",

    "@xcite ) , this experiment provided a strong motivation for subsequent experimental searches in the @xmath13 mass region ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and theoretical studies of refs .",
    "@xcite within the framework of the mm method .",
    "these experiments revealed rotational patterns in the form of ridge - structures in three - dimensional ( 3d ) rotational mapped spectra with dynamic moments of inertia @xmath14 ranging from 63 to 111 mev@xmath15 in 12 different nuclei @xcite ; the values around 110 mev@xmath15 observed in @xmath16te , @xmath17xe and @xmath18cs suggest that the hd structures were populated in these experiments .",
    "however , no discrete rotational hd bands have been identified .",
    "it is also necessary to mention that several previous attempts to search for high spin hd structures in @xmath19gd @xcite , @xmath1dy @xcite , and @xmath9yb @xcite did not lead to convincing evidences for discrete hd bands .",
    "so far , theoretical investigations of hd at high spin were carried out mainly in the framework of the mm method .",
    "one of the main goals of the current manuscript is to perform for the first time a systematic study of hd within the framework of fully self - consistent theory , the crmf theory .",
    "[ nuclear - chart ] shows the part of the nuclear chart where our studies are performed .",
    "we restrict our investigation to even - even nuclei ; the only exceptions are odd - mass nuclei @xmath20i [ in which extremely sd doubly magic band has been found ] and @xmath21xe , @xmath22i and @xmath23cs [ which are used in the study of the relative properties of the hd bands ] . in each isotope chain",
    "we consider nuclei ranging from the most proton - rich ones up to the ones located at the neutron - rich side of the @xmath24-stability valley .",
    "neutron - rich nuclei beyond the valley of the @xmath24-stability are excluded from consideration because of the experimental difficulties of studying them at high spins relevant for hd . with the goal to guide future experimental explorations and to find the nuclei in which the hd may be studied with current and future experimental facilities , we define the spins at which the hd bands become yrast in these nuclei .",
    "in addition , available experimental data on the hd ridge - structures in the te , xe , and cs nuclei are analyzed .",
    "the general features of the hd bands are outlined .",
    "the role of the single - particle degrees of freedom at hyperdeformation has not been studied in detail till now .",
    "one of the major goals of the current manuscript is the study of their role , and it is motivated by the desire to understand to what extent theoretical methods developed in the study of the sd bands are also applicable to the hd bands .",
    "it is very unlikely that the spins , parities and excitations energies of the hd bands will be known in the initial stage of their experimental study .",
    "the direct test of the structure of the wave functions of the single - nucleonic orbitals ( e.g. via magnetic moments ) will also not be possible at that stage .",
    "thus , similar to the case of superdeformation @xcite , the relative properties of different hd bands may play an important role in the interpretation of their structure . in this context , it is important to understand which changes of the single - particle orbitals are involved in going from one hd band to another , and how they affect physical observables like dynamic moments of inertia @xmath14 , transition quadrupole moments @xmath25 , total spin @xmath26 , etc . in particular , we will study whether the theoretical methods which were systematically used in the configuration assignment of the sd bands are also applicable to the hd bands .",
    "these include the methods based on the relative properties of the dynamic moments of inertia @xmath14 @xcite , on the effective alignments @xmath27 @xcite and on the relative transition quadrupole moments @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "[ concl - sect ] contains the main conclusions of our work .",
    "in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory the nucleus is described as a system of point - like nucleons , dirac spinors , coupled to mesons and to the photons @xcite .",
    "the nucleons interact by the exchange of several mesons , namely a scalar meson @xmath31 and three vector particles @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the photon . the cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) theory @xcite represents the extension of rmf theory to the rotating frame .",
    "it has successfully been tested in a systematic way on the properties of different types of rotational bands in the regime of weak pairing such as normal - deformed @xcite , superdeformed @xcite as well as smooth terminating bands @xcite .",
    "in the current study , we restrict ourselves to reflection symmetric shapes since previous calculations in the mm method show no indications that odd - multipole ( octupole , ... ) deformations play a role in the sd and hd bands of the nuclei covered by our study @xcite and in the hd bands of the @xmath34 @xcite mass region .",
    "similar to the case of the sd bands , it is reasonable to expect that the hd bands will not be linked to the low - spin level scheme for a long period of time .",
    "thus , the spins and parities of the hd bands will not be known and it will not be possible to define the kinematic moment of inertia @xmath35 since it depends on the absolute values of the spin .",
    "in such a situation , the dynamic moment of inertia @xmath14 will play an important role in our understanding of the structure of the hd bands .",
    "this is similar to the case of the sd bands ( see refs .",
    "other observables , such as transition quadrupole moments @xmath25 and effective ( relative ) alignments @xmath27 , will also be important .    in the crmf calculations , the rotational frequency @xmath36 , the kinematic moment of inertia @xmath35 and the dynamic moment of inertia @xmath14",

    "the quadrupole deformation @xmath45 for axially - symmetric shapes is frequently defined in self - consistent calculations from calculated and/or experimental quadrupole moments using simple relation @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 fm is the radius of the nucleus , and @xmath48 is a quadrupole moment of the @xmath49-th ( sub)system expressed in @xmath50 .",

    "this is experimentally measurable quantity , so in the future our predictions can be directly compared with experiment .",
    "the deformation properties of the yrast sd band in @xmath1dy ( which is one of the most deformed sd bands @xcite ) are used as a reference .",
    "this is done by introducing normalized transition quadrupole moment @xmath55 in the @xmath56 system @xmath57 this equation is based on the ratio @xmath58 calculated using eq .",
    "( [ beta2 ] ) under the assumption that the @xmath45-values in the @xmath56 system and in @xmath1dy are the same .",

    "thus , in first approximation ( neglecting the higher powers of @xmath45 and higher multipolarity deformations @xmath61 ) the equilibrium deformation of the band in the @xmath56 system having the @xmath55 value is the same as in the yrast sd band of @xmath1dy .",
    "we describe the band as hyperdeformed if its @xmath25 value exceeds @xmath55 by at least 40% .",
    "this criteria is somewhat relaxed in the @xmath62 nuclei for which the band is defined as hd if its @xmath25 value exceeds @xmath55 by at least 30% .",
    "the effective ( relative ) alignment @xmath27 between two bands is defined as the difference between the spins of two levels in bands a and b at the same rotational frequency @xmath63 @xcite : @xmath64 this quantity has been used frequently in the analysis of the single - particle structure of the sd bands and the configuration assignment ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "it depends on both the alignment properties of the single - particle orbitals(s ) by which the two bands differ and the polarization effects induced by the particles in these orbitals @xcite .",
    "the latter are in part related to nuclear magnetism .",

    "it was concluded that physical observables of interest are described with sufficient numerical accuracy when @xmath77 is used for the sd and nd states and @xmath84 for the hd states .",
    "thus , we employ a hybrid calculational scheme in which the crmf solutions in the nd- and sd minima are sought using @xmath77 , while the ones in the hd minima using @xmath84 . in all crmf calculations ,",
    "we use @xmath86 . in order to eliminate the numerical inaccuracies in the definition of the crossing spin @xmath76 ,",
    "the yrast nd / sd configurations , which are crossed by the yrast hd configuration , were recalculated in the crossing region using @xmath84 , and only then the crossing spin was defined .",
    "one should keep in mind that even with @xmath84 the spins at which the hd configurations become yrast in the calculations may be overestimated by @xmath87 when the deformation of the hd configurations exceeds appreciably the one corresponding to the lower limit of hd .",
    "when searching for different types of rotational structures it is important to find the solutions in all local minima which are close to the yrast line in order to properly define the crossing spins between the rotational structures of different nature .",
    "this is easily achievable in the macroscopic+microscopic approach by creating potential energy surfaces ( pes ) in the deformation space covering quadrupole and triaxial deformations @xcite .",
    "however , the computational cost to create similar pes in the self - consistent models is enormous , thus , it has never been attempted in rotating nuclei . in order to overcome this problem , we use the fact that in self - consistent approaches without pairing the deformation of the basis defines to a large extent the local minima where the solutions will be obtained .",
    "thus , the solutions in the nd minima , including triaxial ones , are searched using three combinations of the deformation of basis : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . in a similar way , the solutions in the sd minima are searched using the following combinations of the deformations of basis @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",

    "as follows from previous studies , this parametrization provides a good description of the moments of inertia of the rotational bands in unpaired regime in the sd and nd minima @xcite , the single - particle energies for the nuclei around the valley of @xmath24 stability @xcite and the excitation energies of the sd minima @xcite .",
    "nl3 @xcite is an alternative parametrization , the quality of which has been tested in rotating nuclei ( but less extensively than in the case of nl1 ) @xcite .",

    "previous experience shows that different parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian give similar moments of inertia for the same configuration @xcite ( see also fig .",

    "for the first time , the hyperdeformation at high spin has been studied in a systematic way within the framework of a fully self - consistent theory : the cranking relativistic mean field theory .",
    "the study covers even - even nuclei in the @xmath0 part of nuclear chart .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the crossing spins @xmath76 , at which the hd configurations become yrast , are lower for proton - rich nuclei .",
    "this is a feature seen in the most of studied isotope chains ; by going from the @xmath24-stability valley towards the proton - drip line one can lower @xmath76 by approximately @xmath97 . *",
    "the density of the hd bands in the spin range where they are yrast or close to yrast is high in the majority of the cases .",
    "for such densities , the feeding intensity of an individual hd band will most likely drop below the observational limit of modern experimental facilities .",
    "this fact has to be taken into account when planning the experiments for a search of discrete hd bands .",
    "our calculations indicate cd isotopes and few other nuclei with large shell gaps ( see sect .",
    "[ gen - obs ] for details ) as the best candidates for a search of discrete hd bands .",
    "an alternative candidate is the doubly magic extremely superdeformed band in @xmath20i , the deformation of which is only slightly lower than that of the hd bands , and which may be observed with existing experimental facilities .",
    "* the high density of the hd bands will most likely favor the observation of the rotational patterns in the form of ridge - structures in three - dimensional rotational mapped spectra .",
    "the study of these patterns as a function of proton and neutron numbers , which seems to be possible with existing facilities , will provide a valuable information about hyperdeformation at high spin .",
    "* with a very few exceptions , the hd shapes undergo a centrifugal stretching that results in an increase of the values of the transition quadrupole @xmath25 and mass hexadecapole @xmath40 moments as well as the dynamic moments of inertia @xmath14 with increasing rotational frequency .",
    "the kinematic moments of inertia @xmath35 show very small variations in the frequency range of interest",
    ". these are general features of the hd bands which distinguish them from the normal- and superdeformed bands .",
    "such features have not been seen before in the calculations without pairing . in unpaired regime ,",
    "the @xmath25 , @xmath14 and @xmath35 values decrease with rotational frequency in the sd configurations ; the only exceptions are the regions of unpaired bands crossings .",
    "* the individual properties of the single - particle orbitals are not lost at hd . in the future",
    ", they will allow the assignment of the configurations to the hd bands using the relative properties of different bands .",
    "such methods of configuration assignment were originally developed for superdeformation .",
    "in contrast to the case of sd , our analysis in the @xmath13 mass region shows that only simultaneous application of the methods based on effective alignments and relative transition quadrupole moments by comparing experimental and theoretical @xmath115 values will lead to a reliable configuration assignment for the hd bands .",
    "moreover , additional information on the structure of the hd bands will be obtained from the band crossing features ; the cases of strong interaction of the bands in unpaired regime at hd will be more common as compared with the situation at sd .",
    "the physics of hyperdeformation at high spin is also defined by the fission barriers ; the competition with fission certainly makes the population of the hd states difficult .",
    "it is an important issue , which , however , goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript .",
    "it is likely that the fission barriers are small or non - existent at the spins around @xmath116 in some of the studied nuclei ; the observation of the hd bands then will not be possible in these systems .",
    "this problem definitely deserves a deeper attention ; the study of the fission barriers at high spin typical for hd within the framework of the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory is in its initial stage and the results will be presented in a forthcoming manuscript .",
