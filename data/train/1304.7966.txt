    "in wireless communication applications , such as wireless personal area networks ( wpan ) and sensor networks ( wsn ) , multipath fading is a major factor that deteriorates the quality of information transmission . as a spread - spectrum modulation ,",
    "differential chaos shift keying ( dcsk ) offers a promising solution to mitigate the effect of fading in such systems @xcite .",
    "the dcsk communication system can be easily implemented in hardware since it can work without synchronization nor channel estimation but requiring only frame and symbol rate samplings , which makes it very promising in wpan and wsn applications @xcite . in recent years , some variants of the dcsk modulation technique have been proposed @xcite .",
    "aiming to further overcome the signal fading arising from multipath propagation , cooperative diversity has been applied to the conventional dcsk system to construct a two - user cooperative dcsk system @xcite .",
    "another desirable application of dcsk is to be combined with multiple - access ( ma ) techniques .",
    "recently , a large amount of research work have been devoted to ma - dcsk systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , the walsh code has been used to ensure the orthogonality of dcsk channels @xcite , so that the interference among different users can be avoided . in @xcite ,",
    "the multiply - antenna relay was adopted in the ma - dcsk system ( i.e. , mimo - dcsk system ) to increase the robustness against signal fading .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , in all existing ma - dcsk systems , cooperative communication ( cc ) technique has never been applied , for which the cooperative method developed in @xcite is not applicable .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel cooperative scheme for the ma - dcsk systems , forming a ma - dcsk - cc system , to improve the performance of communications .",
    "we analyze the bit - error - rate ( ber ) performance and the throughput of the new system under a decode - and - forward ( df ) relaying protocol over nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels .",
    "both theoretical analyses and computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed system has significant performance improvement in comparison with the dcsk non - cooperative ( dcsk - nc ) system and the mimo - dcsk system .",
    "moreover , we show that the throughput of the proposed system is almost the same as that of the dcsk - nc system , superior to that of the mimo - dcsk system .",
    "for an @xmath1-user ma - dcsk system , the orthogonal walsh code sequences are adopted to eliminate interference among users ( i.e. , there is no interference among users if walsh code is used ) @xcite .",
    "in such a system , the @xmath2-order walsh code is defined to accommodate @xmath1 users , where @xmath3 in which @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "each dcsk modulated signal includes @xmath6 sub - segments .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the length of each carrier segment ( i.e. , sub - spreading factor ) .",
    "then , the global spreading factor is kept at @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9th transmitted signal of the @xmath10th user is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the @xmath9th transmitted symbol , @xmath13 represents the @xmath14th element of the @xmath6-order walsh code , and @xmath15 represents the chaotic carrier .    at the receiver , we assume perfect timing synchronization and utilize the generalized maximum likelihood ( gml ) detector @xcite to demodulate the received signals .      the full - duplex system model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.1 ] . referring to this figure ,",
    "the transmission period is divided into two phases , namely @xmath16st phase and @xmath17nd phase . in the @xmath16st phase , the @xmath10th ( @xmath18 ) user @xmath19 broadcasts its message @xmath20 to other terminals . in the @xmath17nd phase",
    ", @xmath21 helps the remainder @xmath22 to forward their messages . using the df protocol",
    ", @xmath21 transmits the reconstructed signals , i.e. , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the reconstructed signal of @xmath25 ) , to the destination if it decodes correctly ; otherwise , it remains idling .",
    "based on the above description , the cooperative scheme of the system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.2 ] .",
    "according to such a scheme , the received signals are expressed as    -user ma - dcsk - cc system.,width=336,height=105 ]    -user ma - dcsk - cc system.,width=336,height=105 ]    @xmath26    here , the superscripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' denote the @xmath16st phase and the @xmath17nd phase , respectively ; @xmath27 = 1\\sim n$ ] ; @xmath28 denotes convolution ; @xmath29 represents the received signals at @xmath21 in the @xmath16st phase while @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) represents the received signals at destination in the @xmath32th phase ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are white gaussian noise random variables ( rv ) with zero mean and variance @xmath35 ; @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the channel impulse responses of links @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively , which can be represented as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the attenuation and time delay of the @xmath9th path , respectively , and @xmath45 is the number of multipaths .",
    "moreover , the attenuation @xmath43 follows a nakagami-@xmath46 distribution , with the probability density function ( pdf ) given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the fading factor of the @xmath9th path , @xmath49 equals @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the gamma function .",
    "for ease of analysis , assume that the channels possess an uniform scale parameter , i.e. , @xmath49 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath53 ) are kept constant for all path - components .",
    "also , assume that the receiver can capture all paths power , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , the ber performance and throughput of the proposed ma - dcsk - cc system are analyzed over a nakagami-@xmath0 fading channel . to simplify the analysis , assuming that the energy per bit of each user is constant , denoted by @xmath55 , and the energy is allocated uniformly to every transmission phase .",
    "moreover , we assume that the time delay @xmath44 is much shorter than the bit duration ( @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the sampling period ) such that the inter - symbol interference can be ignored . also , the equal - gain combiner ( egc ) is employed at the receiver for easy implementation .      here",
    ", we derive the ber expression of @xmath21 in the @xmath1-user ma - dcsk system , since all users in such a scenario have the same error performance .",
    "let @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 denote the distance from source to destination ( s @xmath61 d ) , source to relay ( s @xmath61 r ) and relay to destination ( r @xmath61 d ) links , respectively ; hence , @xmath62 represents the geometric positions of all terminals . the path loss of a ( s @xmath61 d ) link is defined by @xmath63 .",
    "the total ber under the df protocol is described as @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 denote the bers at the relay receiver with the signal from source , at the destination receiver with the signal from source , and at the destination receiver with all signals from source and relays , respectively .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the received signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a link .",
    "then , the ber of such a link can be obtained by averaging the conditional ber of @xmath68 , as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the conditional ber and pdf of the received snr .",
    "specifically , @xmath70 is given by @xcite @xmath72 \\right ) \\label{eq : condi - ber}\\ ] ] to obtain the explicit expressions of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we firstly need to deduce the pdf of received snrs of the three links : @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    in the @xmath16st phase ,",
    "the received snr of link s @xmath76 ( i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath55 is the bit energy ( the energy consumed in the @xmath16st phase is @xmath80 ) , and @xmath81 is the instantaneous snr of the @xmath9th path .",
    "it is well known that the square of a nakagami-@xmath0-distributed rv follows a gamma distribution , denoted as @xmath82 , with the pdf as follows : @xmath83 based on the nakagami-@xmath46-distributed rv @xmath43 , we obtain the pdf of @xmath81 , as @xmath84 .",
    "hence , @xmath85 is further derived as @xcite @xmath86 here , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are used as short - hand notations for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "as the @xmath22 relays decode the received signal independently , the equivalent received snr of link s @xmath61 r equals @xmath93 , namely , @xmath94 .",
    "likewise , the received snr of link s @xmath61 d is expressed by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are short - hand notations for @xmath91 and @xmath98 , respectively .    moreover , in the @xmath17nd phase , one can get the distribution of the received snr of link @xmath99 d as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 . adopting the egc method ,",
    "@xmath102 is readily obtained through combining all @xmath22 received snr at the destination receiver , resulting in @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are short - hand notations for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively . afterwards , the total received snr at destination with all signals from source and relays can be represented as @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the corresponding pdf can be formulated by @xcite @xmath109 here , the parameters for the case of @xmath110 are subjected to @xmath111 where @xmath112 .    substituting and into yields @xmath113 similarly , with the help of ( the conditional ber expressions of different links are identical ) , @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be calculated by substituting and into , respectively , giving @xmath114 @xmath115 finally , by combining , , , and , the ber of the proposed system , i.e. , @xmath116 , is formulated .",
    "assume that the normalized throughput is defined as the average number of successfully received bits / symbols after error detection in each transmission period ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the throughput @xmath117 is a decreasing function of the ber .",
    "based on such a definition , the normalized throughput of the proposed system is given by @xmath118 also , the normalized throughput of the ma - dcsk - nc system @xcite and mimo - dcsk system @xcite are as follows : @xmath119 @xmath120 where the ber expressions of the dcsk - nc system , i.e. , @xmath121 , and the mimo - dcsk system , i.e. , @xmath122 , are shown in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "one should note that @xmath123 in is the normalized factor because one of the @xmath1 users never transmits any message in the mimo - dcsk system .",
    "thus , reduces to @xmath124 if @xmath1 is enough large .",
    "here , we provide some simulation results for the proposed system .",
    "all the simulations were performed in @xmath125-user ma systems ( @xmath126 ) over nakagami fading channels with parameters @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 . the sub - spreading factor @xmath131 , such that the bit duration is much larger than the time delay , i.e. , @xmath56 . as assumed , the transmission energy per bit of each user is kept constant .    for comparison ,",
    "we also consider two existing ma - dcsk systems , namely the dcsk - nc system and the mimo - dcsk system .",
    "[ fig : fig.3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.4 ] present the ber performance and throughput of the these three systems .",
    "one can observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.3 ] that the dcsk - cc system and the dcsk - nc system are the best - performing one and the worst - performing one , respectively . at a ber of @xmath132",
    ", one can also observe that the dcsk - cc system has a gain about @xmath133  db and @xmath134  db over the mimo - dcsk and dcsk - nc systems , respectively .",
    "moreover , the theoretical ber curves are highly consistent with the simulation curves , demonstrating the correctness of the analytic results .    referring to fig .",
    "4 , the mimo - dcsk system has the lowest throughput since one of the four users only helps the others to transmit messages rather than to send messages by itself .",
    "as can be seen , the proposed system overcomes this weakness and obtains a significant throughput gain as compared to the mimo - dcsk system .",
    "furthermore , the proposed system exhibits almost the same throughput as the dcsk - nc system , i.e. , the throughput of the proposed system is slightly lower than that of the dcsk - nc system in the low - snr region but is slightly higher when @xmath135 exceeds @xmath136  db .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig.5 ] , we compare the ber curves of the proposed system for different fading depths .",
    "the parameters used remain unchanged , except that the fading factor @xmath0 is varied from @xmath16 to @xmath125 . as expected , one can see that the ber performance is improving as @xmath0 is increasing .",
    "however , the rate of improvement is reduced with the increase of the fading factor .",
    "for instance , at a ber of @xmath137 , the improved gain are @xmath17  db , @xmath16  db , and @xmath138  db , respectively , as @xmath0 increases from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , @xmath17 to @xmath139 and @xmath139 to @xmath125 .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed , analyzed and simulated a ma - dcsk - cc system , which can enhance the anti - fading capability in wireless networks .",
    "specifically , we have analyzed the ber performance and throughput of the new system with the df protocol over nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels , which agree with the simulation results almost perfectly .",
    "comparing with the existing dcsk - nc and mimo - dcsk systems , the proposed system not only shows excellent ber performance but also possesses satisfactory throughput .",
    "therefore , among the three systems , the new dcsk - cc system can provide the best possible balance between the ber performance and the throughput .",
    "we believe that the proposed system is very suitable for low - power and low - cost wpan applications .",
