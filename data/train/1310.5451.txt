    "such a strong approximation allows not only to derive weak limit theorems , as donsker s invariance principle for the empirical distribution function , but also almost sure results , as the functional form of the law of the iterated logarithm [ see @xcite ] .",
    "moreover , from a statistical point of view , strong approximations with rates allow to construct many statistical procedures [ we refer to the monograph of @xcite which shows how the asymptotic behavior of the empirical process plays a crucial role in many important statistical applications ] .",
    "in the dependent setting , the weak limiting behavior of the empirical process @xmath10 has been studied by many authors in different cases .",
    "see , among many others , the following : @xcite for stationary gaussian sequences , @xcite for linear processes , @xcite for associated sequences , @xcite for functions of absolutely regular sequences , @xcite for strongly mixing sequences , @xcite for functions of i.i.d .",

    "their result generalizes the functional form of the finkelstein s law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "next , @xcite weakened the strong mixing condition required in @xcite and proved the strong approximation ( [ strappbp ] ) assuming @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "however , this condition still appears to be too restrictive : indeed , rio [ ( @xcite ) , theorem 7.2 , page 96 ] proved that the weak convergence of @xmath23 to a gaussian process holds in @xmath24 under the weaker condition @xmath25 for some @xmath26 . in view of this result",
    ", one may think that the strong approximation by a kiefer process , as given in ( [ strappbp ] ) , holds as soon as the dependence coefficients are of the order of @xmath27 for some @xmath26 .",
    "since the classical mixing coefficients have some limited applicability , many papers have been written in the last decade to derive limit theorems under various weak dependence measures [ see , e.g. , the monograph by @xcite ] . concerning the empirical process , @xcite proved that the weak convergence of @xmath23 to a gaussian process holds in @xmath24 under a dependence condition involving only indicators of a half line , whereas @xcite obtained the same result under conditions on , what he called , the predictive dependent measures .",
    "these predictive dependence measures allow coupling by independent sequences and are well adapted to some functions of i.i.d",
    ". sequences . however , they seem to be less adequate for functionals of nonirreducible markov chains or dynamical systems having some invariant probability .",
    "the recent paper by @xcite deals with strong approximations as in ( [ strappbp ] ) in the weak dependent setting by considering , what they called , @xmath28-mixing conditions . actually , their @xmath28-mixing condition lies much closer to the predictive dependent measures considered by @xcite and is also very well adapted to functions of i.i.d . sequences . roughly speaking",
    ", they obtained ( [ strappbp ] ) as soon as @xmath3 is lipschitz continuous , the sequence @xmath29 can be approximated by a @xmath30-dependent sequence , and one has a nice control of the deviation probability of the approximating error .    in this paper , we prove that the strong approximation ( [ strappbp ] ) holds under a dependence condition involving only indicators of a half line , which is quite natural in this context [ see the discussion at the beginning of section 2 in @xcite ] .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath31 for some positive @xmath1 , where the coefficients @xmath32 are defined in the next section , we prove that there exists a continuous ( with respect to its natural metric ) centered gaussian process @xmath7 with covariance function given by ( [ covariance ] ) such that @xmath33 } \\bigl|r_{x}\\bigl(s,[nt ] \\bigr)-k_x\\bigl(s,[nt]\\bigr)\\bigr| = o\\bigl(n^{1/2 - \\varepsilon}\\bigr)\\qquad \\mbox{almost surely}\\ ] ] for some @xmath34 . as consequences of ( [ strapp ] ) , we obtain the functional form of finkelstein s law of the iterated logarithm and we recover the empirical central limit theorem obtained in @xcite . notice that our dependence condition can not be directly compared to the one used in the paper by @xcite .    in theorem  [ maindyn ]",
    "we show that ( [ strapp ] ) also holds for the empirical process associated to an expanding map @xmath35 of the unit interval with a neutral fixed point at @xmath36 , as soon as the parameter @xmath37 belongs to @xmath380 , 1/2[$ ] ( this parameter describes the behavior of @xmath35 in the neighborhood of zero ) .",
    "moreover , we shall prove that the functional law of the iterated logarithm can not hold at the boundary @xmath39 , which shows that our conditions are in some sense optimal ( see remark  [ remoptimality ] for a detailed discussion about the optimality of the conditions ) .",
    "let us now give an outline of the methods used to prove the strong approximation ( [ strapp ] ) .",
    "we consider the dyadic fluctuations @xmath40 of the empirical process on a grid with a number of points depending on @xmath41 , let s say @xmath42 .",
    "our proof is mainly based on the existence of multidimensional gaussian random variables in @xmath43 that approximate , in a certain sense , the fluctuations of the empirical process on the grid .",
    "these multidimensional gaussian random variables will be the skeleton of the approximating kiefer process . to prove the existence of these gaussian random variables",
    ", we apply a conditional version of the kantorovich  rubinstein theorem , as given in @xcite ( see our section  [ constructkiefer ] ) .",
    "the multidimensional gaussian random variables are constructed in such a way that the error of approximation in @xmath44 of the supremum norm between the fluctuations of the empirical process on the grid and the multidimensional gaussian r.v.s is exactly the expectation of the wasserstein distance of order @xmath45 ( with the distance associated to the supremum norm ) between the conditional law of the fluctuations of the empirical process on the grid and the corresponding multidimensional gaussian law [ see definition  [ defwasser ] and equality ( [ coupling1 ] ) ] .",
    "this error can be evaluated with the help of the lindeberg method as done in section  [ sectiongapp ] [ a  similar approach has been used recently by @xcite for the partial sum process ] .",
    "the oscillations of the empirical process , namely , the quantities involved in ( [ psd4 ] ) and ( [ psd6 ] ) , are handled with the help of a suitable exponential inequality combined with the rosenthal - type inequality proved by dedecker ( @xcite ) , proposition 3.1 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to adapt the method of constructing the skeleton kiefer process ( by conditioning up to the future rather than to the past ) to deal with the empirical process associated to intermittent maps .",
