    "the standard model of work extraction is based on an engine composed of a working medium , a piston and two heat baths that are at equilibrium with different temperatures .",
    "its importance stems from its success to set an universal bound to any work extraction process , the carnot bound , which shows , in agreement with the kelvin s formulation of the second law of thermodynamics , two different temperatures are needed for work extraction . besides , there is a complementary picture of an engine as a self - oscillating system _  focusing on their ability to convert energy inputted at one frequency ( usually zero ) into work outputted at another , well - defined frequency \" _",
    ". this picture seems to apply to all types of turbines and motors @xcite and one can expect that it is equally correct for engines powered by a flux of photons .",
    "the standard description of the photovoltaic cell involves the following processes",
    "@xcite : + i ) generation of the charge carriers due to the absorption of photons , + ii ) subsequent separation of the photo - generated charge carriers in the junction .",
    "as noticed in @xcite the often used explanation of the second process as caused by the emerging electric field in p - n junction can not be correct .",
    "charge separation is supposed to produce a dc current which , on the other hand , can not be driven in a closed circuit by a purely electrical potential difference .",
    "a standard thermodynamical explanation of electric current ( work ) generation in photovoltaic and thermoelectric heat devices is the following : + electrons gain energy in a form of heat current @xmath0 from the hot bath , then flow against potential difference @xmath1 producing useful power @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an electric current .",
    "a part of the heat described by the heat current @xmath4 is dumped to the cold bath .",
    "+ the laws of thermodynamics put the following constraints @xmath5 @xmath6 adding kinetic equations describing the processes of electron - hole creation , thermalization to the ambient temperature and recombination one obtains the correct formulas for the open circuit voltage and voltage - current relation .",
    "however , this picture does not explain the mechanism of persistent steady work extraction .",
    "similarly , for a steam engine the net pressure due to the temperature difference obviously provides the net force acting on the piston but to explain the permanent periodic action of this engine we have to understand the details of operation of a piston linked to a flywheel and valves .",
    "this is exactly the place where the mechanism of self - oscillation supported by the external constant energy flow enters into the game . in the following",
    "we propose a model in which plasma oscillations play a role of the periodic motion of a  piston \" and show that , indeed , under realistic assumptions a positive power is supplied to this essentially classical macroscopic oscillator .",
    "subsequently , the collective charge oscillations at thz frequencies are rectified by a p - n junction diode (  valve \" ) to the output dc current .",
    "the mathematical formalism is based on the quantum markovian master equations for slowly driven open quantum systems studied in @xcite ( compare @xcite,@xcite for the fast driving case ) , and consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "we consider a model of heat engine which consists of a  working medium \" called simply a system , two baths at different temperatures , and a  work reservoir \" called often a  piston \" which is a system supplying to or extracting work from the working medium . because work , in contrast to heat , is an ordered and deterministic form of energy we expect that a piston should be a macroscopic system operating in the semi - classical regime .",
    "therefore , within the reasonable approximation can be replaced by external deterministic driving @xcite .    for the readers convenience we briefly present the formalism of quantum master equations ( qme ) based on the davies weak coupling limit @xcite , the lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan generators and their extension to slowly varying external driving . then the thermodynamical consequences are discussed and a special generic class of models with _ diagonal , weak driving _ , applicable to the theory of solar cells , is presented .      .    the total system consisting of a system @xmath7 weakly coupled to a bath @xmath8 .",
