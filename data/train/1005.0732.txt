    "cooperative diversity is a highly promising technique for coverage extension and reliability improvement of wireless networks .",
    "it exploits the additional degrees of freedom of the fading environment , which is introduced by the spatially distributed multiple relays utilizing either amplify - and - forward ( af ) or decode - and - forward ( df ) relaying . proposed recently in @xcite , the opportunistic",
    "relaying is a simple yet efficient cooperative diversity protocol , whose diversity - multiplexing tradeoff is identical to that of the more complex distributed space - time coding cooperative schemes @xcite . by selecting a single  best \" relay among the all available relays ,",
    "the opportunistic relaying achieves full spatial diversity while maintaining the spectral efficiency of a two - hop communication link .",
    "the outage and error probabilities of the opportunistic relaying systems have been studied in @xcite-@xcite , which clearly demonstrate its excellent performances . however , there are some design issues for which the outage and error probabilities criteria are not sufficient , such as , packet or slot lengths and latencies , switching rates @xcite , power and bandwidth allocation or , decision criterion for changing adaptive modulation levels",
    ".    these issues can be addressed by investigating the system s second - order outage statistics . to the best of authors knowledge ,",
    "such statistics that describe the outage events of cooperative systems , such as , the average outage rate ( aor ) and average outage duration ( aod ) , have not been studied previously .",
    "we propose the aor and the aod be defined with respect to the capacity outage events derived from information - theoretic capacity of the opportunistic system .",
    "similar definition of the outage statistics has been applied over mimo systems in @xcite . in this letter , we derive exact expressions for the aor and the aod of opportunistic systems , employing either af or df relaying in rayleigh fading environment .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we consider a typical half - duplex dual - hop communication scenario , where the communication between the source @xmath0 and the destination @xmath1 is possible only via @xmath2 relays ( denoted by @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , as the direct path is assumed blocked by an intermediate wall . in the beginning of each slot ( divided into two equal sub - slots ) , a single  best \" opportunistic relay is selected out of the @xmath2 possible dual - hop paths for relaying the communication between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . during the first sub - slot , @xmath0 transmits its signal over the first hop , while the selected relay forwards that signal toward @xmath1 over the second hop during the second sub - slot .",
    "the channel is exposed to rayleigh fading and is assumed to remain constant during the entire slot duration . without loss in generality , we assume that @xmath0 and the selected",
    " best \" relay transmit with equal powers @xmath5 , rendering the total available transmission power to @xmath6 . denoting the rayleigh - faded channel gains of hops @xmath7 and @xmath8 during a given slot @xmath9 by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the received signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) at the relay @xmath3 and at the destination @xmath1",
    "are expressed as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 as the noise power .",
    "specifying the average squared channel gains as @xmath15 = \\omega_{sk}$ ] and @xmath16 = \\omega_{kd}$ ] , the average received snrs at @xmath3 and @xmath1 are respectively given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the relay selection is based on the estimation of the end - to - end performance over the dual - hop path @xmath19 using the _ selection variable _ @xmath20 , which is estimated separately by each relay @xmath3 in the beginning of each slot from its channel state information ( csi ) @xcite . to facilitate channel state estimation by the relays , @xmath0 and @xmath1 previously exchange short control packets . in the beginning of slot @xmath9 , the  best",
    "\" relay @xmath21 is selected in a distributed manner by using the _ selection policy _ : @xmath22      in the beginning of slot @xmath9 , each df relay estimates the selection variable @xmath23 which actually evaluates the minimal instantaneous received snr among the two hops , @xmath24 .",
    "we assume fixed gain af relays that amplify the received signal from the first hop by @xmath25 and forward it to @xmath1 over the second hop @xcite . in the beginning of slot @xmath9 , each af relay estimates the selection variable @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "actually , each af relay evaluates the dual - hop snr that is relayed over @xmath3 and received at @xmath1 .",
    "note that fixed - gain ( e.g. , semi - blind ) af relays have considerably simpler but yet comparably close performance to that of the variable gain af relays @xcite .",
    "we consider 2-dimensional isotropic scattering around source @xmath0 , relays @xmath3 and destination @xmath1 , all of which are assumed to be mobile and have no line - of - sight with other stations .",
    "thus , each @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) hop behaves as a mobile - to - mobile rayleigh channel .",
    "its channel gain , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , is a time - correlated rayleigh random process with known statistical properties ( e.g. , the doppler spectrum ) @xcite .",
    "if a station at one end of a hop is fixed , the mobile - to - mobile rayleigh - fading hop is transformed into the  classic \" fixed - to - mobile rayleigh - fading hop @xcite .",
    "the time derivative @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is independent from the channel gain @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and follows the gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) with zero mean and variance [ [ ref7 ] , eq .",
    "( a5 ) ] [ [ ref10 ] , eq . ( 39 ) ] @xmath34 in ( [ 3a])-([3b ] ) , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the maximum doppler rates of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and relay @xmath3 @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the doppler rate ( and consequently the aor ) is expressed in the unit @xmath39 . expressing the slot duration in seconds , both the doppler rate ( now becoming the doppler frequency ) and the aor",
    "are expressed in hz .      in a given slot @xmath9 ,",
    "the opportunistic relaying system experiences a capacity outage event when the mutual information of the dual - hop path over the  best \" relay @xmath21 drops below some predefined spectral efficiency @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 thus , the resulting time - varying capacity @xmath43 suffers from the random occurrence of capacity outage events , during which the channel is unable to support the specified @xmath40 . transforming ( [ 4 ] ) , the capacity outage event at slot @xmath9 occurs if @xmath44 where the outage threshold is @xmath45 .",
    "note , @xmath46 can be varied by varying @xmath40 ( as in @xcite ) or @xmath47 ( as in this work ) , but the functional dependencies of the increasing @xmath40 or the decreasing @xmath47 ( in db ) have almost same shapes .",
    "using a similar approach to that presented in @xcite for deriving level crossing rates ( lcr ) of  classic \" selection diversity systems , the joint pdf of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the joint pdf of selection variable @xmath20 and its time derivative @xmath52 . assuming @xmath3",
    "is selected  best \" relay , @xmath53 denotes the conditional probability that the selection variable @xmath54 of @xmath3 drops below @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath58 .",
    "the aor is evaluated based on the standard lcr definition [ [ ref6 ] , chapter 1 ] , yielding @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the aor of the dual - hop path over the relay @xmath3 .",
    "the aod is then given by @xmath61      we now focus on the random process @xmath62 , defined by ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "communication through the relay @xmath3 falls in outage if either one of the two hops fail .",
    "thus , the pdf of @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 since both hops follow the rayleigh pdf , @xmath64 is also determined to follow the rayleigh pdf , @xmath65 with @xmath66 , and the respective cdf @xmath67 .",
    "using @xmath68 and the independence of the channel gains and their respective time derivatives , the required joint pdf is found as @xmath69 in rayleigh fading , ( [ 14 ] ) specializes to @xmath70 thus rendering @xmath54 and @xmath71 as independent rvs , where @xmath72 is given by ( [ 12 ] ) and @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 denoting zero mean gaussian pdfs with variances @xmath76 ( [ 3a ] ) and @xmath77 ( [ 3b ] ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the aor of dual - hop path over @xmath3 is obtained as    @xmath78    with @xmath79 given by ( [ 12 ] ) . inserting ( [ 17 ] ) into ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , we obtain the aor and the aod of df relaying system .          the exact expressions for the cdf and the aor of the random process @xmath80 , defined by ( [ 2 ] ) , are respectively given by [ [ ref9 ] , eq .",
    "( 9 ) ] and [ [ ref10 ] , eq . ( 19 ) ] , as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the first - order modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "note that ( [ 19 ] ) can be efficiently and accurately evaluated by applying the gauss - hermite quadrature rule [ [ ref11 ] , eq .",
    "( 25.4.46 ) ] . combining ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) into ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , we obtain the aor and the aod of af relaying system .",
    "note , if source @xmath0 and destination @xmath1 are fixed , the approach presented in this section can be applied to derive analogous analytic expressions for aors and aods for more general fading channels ( such as , rice and nakagami-@xmath83 models ) , because such fixed - to - mobile hops have known second - order statistical properties .",
    "in this section , we present illustrative examples for the normalized aor ( fig .",
    "1 ) an the normalized aod ( fig .",
    "2 ) in function of @xmath47 of opportunistic relaying system employing either df or af relays . the source @xmath0 and the destination @xmath1 are fixed ( @xmath84 ) , whereas all the relays are mobile and introduce same maximum doppler rates @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "the aor and the aod are normalized with respect to the doppler rate @xmath87 as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the average squared channel gains of all hops are equal to @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) , thus rendering total available transmission power equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the spectral efficiency is set to @xmath93 bps / hz . the monte carlo simulations clearly validate our derived analytical results .",
