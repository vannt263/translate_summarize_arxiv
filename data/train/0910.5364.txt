    "the loss of coherence in quantum systems is the hurdle that needs to be overcome in attempts to make use of quantum mechanics on larger and larger scales , most notably for quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "decoherence disentangles quantum states @xcite , which is why for experimental realizations of quantum information processors it is of fundamental importance to get a thorough understanding of the irreversible processes involved @xcite .",
    "decoherence is also put forward to explain the appearance of classical properties in quantum systems @xcite .    in open quantum system dynamics , damping ( population transfer ) is to be distinguished from decoherence ( loss of phase relations in a certain basis ) .",
    "while damping necessarily implies decoherence , the converse need not be true for suitable interactions .",
    "moreover , decoherence often occurs faster than damping , so that a description of the irreversible dynamics neglecting damping may be a valid approach for a short enough time .",
    "a prominent example is the quantum brownian motion model @xcite , where the damping term is irrelevant during rapid decoherence @xcite .",
    "pure decoherence is usually referred to as _ dephasing _ or _",
    "phase damping_.    it is often stated that decoherence of an open quantum system is due to growing entanglement between system and environment @xcite . nevertheless , more often than one might think , the resulting irreversible dynamics of the open system may be modeled entirely without invoking a quantum environment .",
    "rather , the dynamics turns out to be indistinguishable from a random unitary ( ru ) evolution , which can be thought of as originating from classical fluctuations  sometimes called `` random external fields '' @xcite ( see also the corresponding discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "note that in one of the most detailed experimental studies of decoherence in ion traps , classical fluctuations ( i.e. , ru dynamics ) are used to cause controlled decoherence @xcite . in nmr decoherence studies ,",
    "too , fluctuating classical fields are employed @xcite .",
    "there are many more relevant instances of decoherence that are of ru type .",
    "in fact , for a single qubit or qutrit , any possible phase damping is ru @xcite . also , the very often employed model of markovian dephasing ( lindblad master equation ) @xcite belongs to this class since any self - adjoint lindblad operator may be identified with a white noise term in a suitable hamiltonian . in this vein ,",
    "the quantum brownian motion master equation mentioned above ( neglecting damping ) follows from a white noise force term in the hamiltonian , therefore being ru .",
    "based on feynman and vernon s influence functional approach , one sees that the latter is not even restricted to the usual high temperature limit but can easily be extended to any temperature using colored noise  as long as times are short enough so that the non - markovian damping kernel may be neglected @xcite .",
    "we conclude that many widely used decoherence scenarios are of the ru class .",
    "still , from the work of landau and streater @xcite  which plays a central role for our results here  it is known that phase damping is not necessarily ru .",
    "however , there is no known simple criterion able to decide whether a given phase damping dynamics belongs to the ru class . from a more practical point of view , a test for a channel to be of non - ru type is also of relevance for quantum error correction @xcite for it is known that such errors may not be fully corrected @xcite",
    ".    we deem it desirable to have a simple , explicit example of _ quantum decoherence _ at hand of which it is known that it can not be expressed using stochastic hamiltonians . using a two qubit system we present a model",
    "of which we show that phase damping truly rests on growing entanglement with a quantum environment . somewhat similar to studies by havel and co - workers , our proposal may be implemented in nmr systems @xcite , and also in ion trap quantum computers @xcite .    in a first step ,",
    "we choose as environment a single , third qubit .",
    "the proof that the corresponding decoherence can not be understood in terms of ru dynamics follows immediately from the work of landau and streater ( sec .",
    "ii ) . remarkably , using the bloch sphere picture , we find a nice geometrical measure ( a volume ) that indicates how `` non - ru '' the dynamics is .",
    "this quantity correlates surprisingly well with the distance of the quantum decoherence channel from the convex set of ru dynamics ( using the so - called cb - norm , sec .",
    "iii ) . in sec .",
    "iv we extend our model to include genuine irreversibility .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum state @xmath0 = \\sum_i k_i { \\varrho}k_i^\\dagger$ ] is a completely positive map ( or quantum channel ) with kraus operators @xmath1 @xcite ( neglecting initial correlations ) .",
    "a decoherence or phase damping channel belongs to the class of doubly stochastic channels .",
    "these are trace preserving and unital ( mapping the identity onto itself ) , corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the question about the nature of the irreversibility ( entanglement vs ru ) is then in close analogy to the classical birkhoff theorem , stating that every real doubly stochastic matrix can be written as a convex sum of permutations @xcite . in the quantum case , this corresponds to the question of whether the set of doubly stochastic quantum channels is identical to the set of ru channels @xmath4 = \\sum_i p_i u_i { \\varrho}u_i^\\dagger$ ] with unitary @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ( see @xcite for recent work on ru channels ) .",
    "decoherence or phase damping channels are among the simplest conceivable maps .",
    "they are defined by the requirement that , in the given basis @xmath8 with @xmath9 , no population transfer takes place : @xmath10const .",
    "the only effect of the `` environment '' is thus to change coherences @xmath11diag@xmath12 and , correspondingly , the whole map @xmath13 $ ] is diagonal , @xmath14 with @xmath15 any set of @xmath16 normalized complex vectors @xcite .",
    "phase damping channels are just the diagonal , doubly stochastic quantum channels .",
    "if the phase damping channel @xmath17 results from the coupling between the system and a quantum mechanical environment , the vectors @xmath18 may be understood as relative quantum states of the environment , relative to the states of the distinguished basis @xcite . yet , this need not be : for a single qubit the most general phase damping channel @xmath19 may obviously be obtained from @xmath20 with a random variable @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "landau and streater show in @xcite that for the case of @xmath24 , e.g. , for at least a two - qubit system , there exist non - unitary extremal maps in the set of diagonal doubly stochastic quantum channels : there are phase damping channels of two qubits that are not of ru type .     of qubits @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the `` environment '' initially consists of just a single qubit @xmath27 , which is later coupled to an additional zero temperature bath . ]",
    "we set out to construct such a channel , which requires having a test for a channel s extremality .",
    "a given diagonal doubly stochastic channel @xmath17 is extremal iff it admits a kraus representation @xmath4=\\sum_{i=1}^r k_i { \\varrho}k_i^\\dagger$ ] , where @xmath28 is a linear independent set of matrices @xcite .",
    "this linear independence is equivalent to a quality of the associated vectors @xmath29 called `` full set of vectors '' ( fsov ) @xcite , which is attained if , for a complex matrix @xmath30 , @xmath31 implies @xmath32 .",
    "note that in case of a two - qubit channel extremality implies @xmath33 : for @xmath34 this is just unitary dynamics , so that @xmath35 gives the only possibility of an extremal , non - unitary phase damping channel , implying the @xmath18 to be single - qubit states .",
    "based on this relation we give a simple test for extremality .",
    "with @xmath36 we denote the vector containing the usual basis of linear operators in two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "then , for the states @xmath18 of the environmental qubit , the bloch representation reads @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "when also rewriting @xmath39 in this basis , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , the fsov condition demands that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 implies @xmath44 and , accordingly , @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the vectors @xmath46 have to be linear independent , so that we get the following equivalence : @xmath47      \\mbox{is a fsov }     \\end{array }    \\leftrightarrow     v_t : = \\frac{1}{6 } \\det    \\left (      \\begin{array}{cccc }         1 & \\cdots & 1 \\\\{}\\\\        \\vec b_1 & \\cdots & \\vec b_4      \\end{array }    \\right ) \\ne 0 .",
