    "from the phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors it is evident that as a function of doping , antiferromagnetic ( af ) order gives way to @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( dsc ) . this has led to the natural view that these two ordered phases generally compete in these materials . at an overall global scale",
    "this certainly seems to be the case .",
    "however , when including disorder the opposite can also occur : dsc can function as a catalyst for induced spin - density wave ( sdw ) order@xcite .",
    "this takes place because of the generation of low - energy impurity resonance states which are spin split by local magnetic ordering@xcite .",
    "a qualitatively similar effect happens in the vortex phase generated by an external applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the superconducting state is crucial for this cooperative effect to occur between sdw and dsc phases .",
    "experimentally , it is well known that disorder may cause slowing down and eventual freezing of spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "for example , substitution of nonmagnetic zn ions for cu in near - optimally doped la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) has been shown to shift spectral weight into the spin gap , and eventually , for enough zn ( @xmath6 ) , generate elastic magnetic peaks in the neutron response@xcite . in yba@xmath7(cu@xmath8zn@xmath9)@xmath10o@xmath11 with @xmath12 a similar in - gap zn - induced spin mode was observed@xcite .",
    "upon increased temperature @xmath13 the elastic signal decreases and eventually vanishes near @xmath14 which is similar to an equivalent disorder signal in zn - free lsco@xcite , these results of disorder - induced freezing of spin fluctuations are consistent with @xmath1sr data on underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "recent neutron scattering off detwinned yba@xmath7cu@xmath10o@xmath15 ( ybco ) with 2% zn found induced short - range magnetic order and a redistribution of spectral weight from the resonance peak to uniaxial incommensurate ( ic ) spin fluctuations at lower energies@xcite .    applied magnetic fields",
    "introduce vortices into the system and cause much of the same phenomenology as described above for the disorder .",
    "theoretically this can be ascribed to the fact that vortices in dsc also generate low - energy resonance states which may favorably split due to electronic correlations and generate local sdw order@xcite . for samples without static sdw order ,",
    "experiments show that at low magnetic fields the vortices slow down the spin fluctuations and generate an in - gap mode@xcite . for larger fields the ground state exhibits static local sdw order which disappears above @xmath14 .",
    "enhancement of static order was reported first in neutron diffraction experiments@xcite on lsco , with a correlation length of several hundred  , and has been confirmed in other underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "the freezing of spin fluctuations is also relevant even in the absence of substitutional disorder or external applied magnetic fields , as evidenced by the presence of a spin - glass phase in the underdoped regime .",
    "this seems to apply to both `` clean '' cuprates like ybco where quasi - static sdw order is found@xcite , and to intrinsically disordered materials like lsco where the static spin correlations are long - range , and persist for a large doping range well into the dsc dome@xcite .",
    "the size of the spin - glass phase in temperature and doping is clearly enhanced by disorder .    here , we review a picture that has emerged for the description of the induced magnetism in underdoped cuprate materials@xcite .",
    "we focus on the disorder- and field - induced sdw phase coexisting with dsc , and calculate the associated dynamical spin susceptibility .",
    "the basis for our model analysis is the bcs hamiltonian for a dsc with orbital coupling to an applied magnetic field * b * , to which we add site - centered disorder and a local hubbard repulsion treated in an unrestricted hartree - fock approximation : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 creates an electron on site @xmath18 with spin @xmath19 on a @xmath20 square lattice .",
    "the hopping matrix elements between nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites are denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . the magnetic field is included through standard peierls phase factors @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the vector potential in landau gauge .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath1 is adjusted to fix the electron density @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the hole concentration .",
    "the @xmath0-wave pairing amplitude @xmath28 is determined by the strength of an attractive nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath29 .",
    "the impurity potential @xmath30 arises from a concentration @xmath31 of nonmagnetic pointlike scatterers at random positions .",
    "all fields , @xmath28 , the local charge density @xmath32 , and the local magnetization @xmath33 are calculated self - consistently from the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations@xcite . in the following we fix parameters to @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has been used extensively to study the competition between dsc and sdw phases@xcite , the origin of field - induced magnetization@xcite , and moment formation around nonmagnetic impurities@xcite . in the case of many impurities , eq.([hamiltonian ] ) was used to explain the origin of static disorder - induced magnetic droplet phases@xcite , and to study how these may form a quasi - long range ordered sdw phase .",
    "the underlying idea is that when magnetic droplets begin to overlap , either when the magnetic correlation length grows at low doping , or when the concentration of scatterers is increased , the effective interaction between droplets allows them to align their staggered patterns coherently@xcite .",
    "more recently eq.([hamiltonian ] ) was used to obtain semi - quantitative description of the @xmath13-dependence of the elastic neutron response in lsco in an applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "finally , eq.([hamiltonian ] ) has been used to explain various transport measurements@xcite such as , for example , the experimental observation of a non - universal low-@xmath13 limit of the thermal conductivity @xmath36 @xcite in terms of a disorder - induced sdw phase@xcite .",
    "the sdw droplet phase has an enhanced scattering rate while maintaining the same low energy density of states ( dos ) as the homogeneous case , thus breaking the cancellation between the residual quasiparticle dos and relaxation rate which gave rise to the universal @xmath36 in the first place@xcite .",
    "thus , for underdoped cuprates it is not @xmath36 but rather the ( spatially averaged ) low - energy dos which is universal , in agreement with stm experiments@xcite .",
    "theoretically a universal low - energy dos can be traced to suppressed charge modulations caused by the electronic coulomb repulsion@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) supports both a correlation- and disorder - induced sdw phase .",
    "specifically , in the clean case above a critical repulsion @xmath37 a global stripe phase is the favorable state , and disorder acts mainly to scramble the stripes .",
    "below @xmath37 the ground state is a homogeneous dsc but nonmagnetic disorder or vortices may locally induce sdw order if @xmath38 where @xmath39 is another critical interaction strength@xcite . in this low-@xmath40 regime ,",
    "both disorder and the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the pairing are crucial for generating static magnetism .    in the absence of a magnetic field ,",

    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows that not all impurities in the correlated system need to `` magnetize '' for a given @xmath40 ; in the disordered system , the effective criterion to drive the impurity through the local magnetic phase transition is different for each impurity . increasing the repulsion",
    "@xmath40 then increases the concentration of impurities which induce a local magnetization droplet , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) . with further increase of @xmath40 ,",
    "the system evolves from a state with dilute non - overlapping af droplets to connected spin textures .",
    "a similar process takes place in 1d where shender and kivelson@xcite pointed out that the interactions between impurities in a quantum spin chain are non - frustrating : if an impurity creates a local af droplet , a second one can always orient itself to avoid losing exchange energy . in 2d",
    "this continues to apply for spin models with nearest neighbor exchange , but may break down in the presence of mobile charges .    , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( a ) , @xmath45 ( b ) , and @xmath46 ( c ) .",

    "however , it is expected that underdoped systems are characterized by larger effective interactions . within the present scenario for dirty cuprates , the @xmath27 dependence of the spin order",
    "is therefore described qualitatively by the sequence [ fig1](c ) @xmath47 [ fig1](b ) @xmath47 [ fig1](a ) , until it disappears completely at effective @xmath40 s below @xmath39 near optimal doping .",
    "increasing @xmath27 should also be accompanied by a weakening of the dopant disorder potential due to enhanced screening . within our model , increasing @xmath40 or @xmath48 leads to qualitatively similar results , and we can not determine from this approach which effect is dominant in real systems . note from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that af droplets are induced for @xmath49 , a substantially reduced critical value compared to the 1-impurity case where @xmath50 .",
    "this is because the hubbard correlations induce charge redistributions which alter the effective local chemical potential , such that the criterion for magnetization of each impurity site depends on its local disorder environment .",
