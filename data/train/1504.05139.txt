    "we explicitly build a perfect discrete morse function on the moduli space of a polygonal linkage .",
    "the starting point of our construction is a cell decomposition of the moduli space constructed in @xcite and reviewed in the next section .",
    "the number of cells is big : it exceeds the sum of betti numbers very much .",
    "following r. forman , we introduce a discrete morse function on the cell complex which turns to be perfect . according to the discrete morse theory",
    ", this gives a way of contracting some of the cells such that the number of remaining cells is the minimal possible .",
    "the rules of manipulating the cells , and the rules describing gradient paths resemble the solitaire game .",
    "however , this analogy should not be taken too seriously : it is a mere metaphor , not a mathematical statement .",
    "the perfect morse function is constructed in two steps . on the first step",
    "we introduce some natural pairing on the cell complex which substantially reduces the number of critical cells .",
    "however the number of critical cells is not yet minimal possible .    on the second step ( following once again r. forman )",
    "we apply _ path reversing technique _ , which gives a new morse function .",
    "this technique is the discrete version of the milnor - smale  first cancelation theorem  , see @xcite .",
    "originally it allows to reverse just one gradient path , whereas we reverse many of them at a time . in our particular case a careful choice of the paths to be reversed yields a perfect discrete morse function .",
    "it is worthy to mention that the idea of simultaneous reversal of several gradient paths is not new : it appeared in p. hersh s paper @xcite .    using our approach , it is possible to compute homology groups of the configuration space of a polygonal linkage independently on the proof of m. farber and d. schtz @xcite .",
    "however , such a proof does not seem to be a short one , so we do not give the details here .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no smooth perfect morse function on the moduli space of a polygonal linkage is known .",
    "this motivates us to formulate the following open problem :    _ what is the smooth counterpart of the proposed discrete morse function ? _ we mean here not an existence - type theorem , but a function expressed by some ( possibly short ) formula and having some transparent physical or geometrical meaning .",
