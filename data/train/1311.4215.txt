    "super massive black holes ( bhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to be powered by mass accretion trough various types of accretion flows .",
    "cold gas that originates in the host galaxy , or a nearby companion , contains enough angular momentum to result in a non - spherical flow .",
    "this , as well as direct observational evidence , lead to the suggestion of a central small accretion disc ( ad ) that facilitates the loss of angular momentum , and eventual feeding of the bh , through various types of viscosity .",
    "much of the theoretical study of such flows , and the comparison of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with spectroscopic observations of agn , have been focused on geometrically thin , optically thick accretion discs , those systems with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the thickness of the disc at radius @xmath5 .",
    "examples are the seminal work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ss73 ) and numerous publications that are listed in the comprehensive review by @xcite and the more recent paper by @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in standard and non - standard agn ads .",
    "this includes the suggestion of very cold accretion discs around very massive bhs @xcite , winds and outflows from thin discs @xcite and study of truncated , two components discs whose main source of uv radiation is diluted gas inside the classical ss73 disc @xcite .",
    "`` slim accretion discs '' have also been considered in the context of bh feeding .",
    "these systems are characterized by fast accretion rates and high l / l_edd @xmath2 , which results in radiation pressure dominating over gas pressure and a thick geometry .",
    "such systems can differ substantially from thin accretion discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the escape time of the photons emitted in such flows , close to the bh , can become longer than the accretion time , leading to advection and reduction in the mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency .",
    "this is usually referred to as the `` saturated luminosity '' of slim ads .",
    "in addition , a hot corona can develop over a large part of the surface of of a slim disc and the overall sed can differ substantially from the thin disc sed . the result is a significant modification in the well defined relationships between accretion rate , bh mass and bh spin predicted by the thin ad theory .",
    "a recent work by @xcite argued that extreme slim discs , with @xmath6 , can be used as a new type of `` cosmological candles '' since their bolometric luminosity , l_bol @xmath1 , is directly proportional to the bh mass with only a weak ( logarithmic ) dependence on the accretion rate .",
    "additional properties of such systems , as well as the basic terminology used in the study of such systems , are explained in the recent study of pu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) despite their very intriguing physical properties , and the potential observational consequences , the fraction of slim ads among agn remains unknown and poorly studied    this work investigates the accretion rate , bolometric luminosity , growth time and spin of active bhs in large agn samples .",
    "we start from the basic assumption that all active bhs are powered by ads whose mass accretion rate , @xmath0 , is given by the standard thin - disc approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we then study the implications to active bh in large agn samples which we divide according to their bh mass ( m_bh @xmath7 ) and redshift .",
    " 2  describes the calculations of l_bol @xmath1  and l / l_edd @xmath2  under different assumptions about agn discs . in ",
    "3 we apply these calculations to a large sample of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) agn and show that even the most conservative assumptions about the radiative efficiency lead to the conclusion that the fraction of slim ads must be large , at all redshifts .",
    "we also investigate the growth times of active bhs and show why previous estimates of this time might have been wrong .",
    "finally we make a connection between low accretion rate in high mass bhs and the bh spin .",
    " 4 summarizes the results and the major conclusions of this paper . throughout this work",
    "we assume a cosmological model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the goal of this work is to explore a broad range of physical conditions that determine l_bol @xmath1  and l / l_edd @xmath2  in agn with different bh mass and accretion rate .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the entire continuum spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , except for the hard x - ray regime , is emitted by a central thin or slim ad .",
    "we assume that all the energy is provided by mass accretion and re - radiated by the ad .",
    "there are certainly some exceptions , especially among nearby low luminosity agn where the x - ray luminosity is a large part of l_bol @xmath1 .",
    "this is true for only a small fraction of the population considered here and will be neglected for the rest of the paper .",
    "most present day ad models are based on the original blackbody ( bb ) thin - disc model of ss73 with various modifications , such as a more accurate general relativity ( gr ) treatment and improved radiative transfer in the disc atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such modifications are important when comparing a detailed theoretical disc sed to real observations . as is evident from composite agn spectra such as the ones presented in ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a large number of agn seds can not be explained by simple ( bb ) ad models .",
    "the additional modifications , especially those related to the radiation transfer in the disc atmosphere , can improve the agreement considerably .",
    "in particular , there are good reasons to assume ( see below ) that the global energetics of of such systems , as well as @xmath0 , can be reliably estimated by such models once the bh spin ( @xmath11 ) is taken into account .",
    "our work makes use of thin ad calculations .",
    "the numerical code we use is the one described in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the ss73 set of assumptions with a fixed viscosity parameter @xmath12 ( taken here to be 0.1 ) and a spin - dependent innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) which determines the mass - to - radiation conversion efficiency @xmath13 .",
    "the model incorporates a full relativistic treatment for all spin parameters ( @xmath11 ) larger than zero and takes into account comptonization of the emitted radiation in the disc atmosphere . for @xmath14",
    ", it neglects gr effects but not the atmospheric comptonization .",
    "this is a fair approximation since for such spins , the isco is far enough from the bh ( between 6 and 9 gravitational radii ) .",
    "the novel ingredient of the model is the ability to include the effect of mass outflow from the surface of the disc .",
    "the current application of the model , however , assumes no disc wind .    for thin ads , and long enough wavelengths , the mass accretion rate , bolometric luminosity , monochromatic luminosity ( @xmath15 ) , or monochromatic observed flux ( @xmath16),are related thorough various known expressions derived by @xcite , @xcite and several others .",

    "we follow the ( slightly modified ) @xcite recipe to estimate @xmath0  for many sdss agn with measured m_bh @xmath7but unlike their work , we used the ad theory to deduce the acceptable range of l_bol @xmath1  and l / l_edd @xmath2  ( or @xmath39 ) in these objects .",
    "we make use of the lowest allowed value of @xmath13 to obtain a conservative lower limit on @xmath39  which enable us to draw the line between thin and slim ads .",
    "this is then used to estimate the fraction of slim ads in the general agn population .",
    "finally , we looked at the two extremes of the @xmath39   distribution and investigated the consequences to bh growth times and bh spin .",
    "the main results can be summarized as followed :    1 .",
    "the distributions of l_bol @xmath1  and @xmath39  in the agn population is broader and more uncertain than assumed so far .",
    "this is the result of the large uncertainties associated with currently - used bolometric correction factors that are based on objects that are more easily detected by large spectroscopic samples , and do not take into account the large range of possible bh spins .",
    "the ad assumption leads to the conclusion that many agn emit considerably more energy than currently assumed .",
    "slim ads , defined here as those systems with @xmath119 , are very common among agn at all redshifts and most bh mass groups .",
    "for example , the fraction of such agn among sdss sources at @xmath120 with m_bh @xmath7@xmath121 m _ @xmath21 , is larger than 90% . in all such cases ,",
    "the actual l_bol @xmath1  and @xmath39  are likely to be below what is assumed here ( and in other works on @xmath39 ) because of the saturated luminosity of slim ads .",
    "l / l_edd @xmath2[standard]-based estimates of the continuous growth times of a very large number of bhs are either too long ( at the high @xmath0/m_bh @xmath7  end ) or too short ( at the low @xmath0/m_bh @xmath7  end ) . correcting these estimates is essential for improving the understanding of bh and galaxy evolution .",
    "some agn , especially those with the largest mass and lowest @xmath0 , must emit significantly below what is assumed when using luminosities that are based on bolometric correction factors ( l_bol @xmath1[standard ] ) .",
    "this is true even if @xmath13 is the maximum allowed by the thin ad theory .",
    "as shown above , this leads to the conclusion that many sdss sources with such properties contain fast spinning bhs .",
    "a recent work by @xcite demonstrates the potential use of slim agn discs as `` cosmological candles '' .",
    "this is based on the idea that above a certain value of @xmath39  ( @xmath122 ) , the bolometric luminosities of such objects are proportional to the bh mass with only a very weak dependence on @xmath39 . these ideas ought to be established theoretically and experimentally .",
    "our study , which is based on virial - type estimates of bh masses , indicates that there is no shortage of such systems at all redshifts up to at least @xmath123 .",
    "the recent paper by pu et al .",
    "( 2013 ) takes this idea one step further and shows , by direct reverberation mapping based measurements of m_bh @xmath7 , that such systems exist at low redshifts .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this can be extrapolated to higher redshifts and be used to derive distances to active bhs that are powered by slim ads .",
