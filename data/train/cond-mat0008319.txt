    "the bcc phase of @xmath0he has a pronounced quantum nature due to the relatively open structure of the lattice .",
    "quantum effects are manifested in strong anharmonicity of some phonon modes and in the large zero - point kinetic energy of the atoms @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have proposed a new physical model for the local atomic zero - point motion in the bcc phase . in this model",
    "we assume that there exist in the bcc @xmath0he a phase with coherently oscillating and anisotropic local electric dipoles .",
    "the ground - state of these coherent dipoles minimizes the dipolar interaction energy between them .",
    "we find that bosonic phase fluctuations in the ( 110 ) direction reproduce the spectrum of the anomalously soft t@xmath1 phonon .",
    "local dipolar flipping results in a new optic - like branch , described using fermi statistics .",
    "in our model @xcite we focused on the effects of the local zero - point motion of the atoms inside the potential - well on the nature of the ground - state . since in the directions normal to the unit cube s",
    "faces ( i.e. ( 100),(010 ) etc . ) the confining potential well of an atom due to its neighboring atoms is very wide with a pronounced double - minimum structure ( fig.1 ) , the dynamic correlations between the atoms along these directions will tend to keep them apart @xcite , by virtually exciting the atom to oscillate between the minima of the potential along the ( 100 ) direction , correlated with similar zero - point motions of the other atoms ( quantum resonance ) .",
    "if we relax the born - oppenheimer approximation , and allow some relative motion between the ions and the electrons , we will obtain that the motion of the ions creates an oscillating electric dipole .",
    "this oscillating electric dipole moment @xmath2 , is equivalent to a mixing of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 electronic levels @xcite ( fig.1 ) .",
    "since these zero - point dipole moments are correlated between the different atoms , the resulting dipolar interactions are minimized by the configuration of fig.1a .",
    "it is the dipolar interactions that drive the correlated zero - point nuclear oscillation with energy @xmath5 .",
    "the oscillating state of quantum resonance of each atom is of the form : @xmath6 , where @xmath7,@xmath8 are the electronic ground - state and first excited state , and @xmath9 being the mixing of the levels due to the oscillation of the nucleus .",
    "the system oscillates in resonance between the equivalent up / down arrangements of the ground - state dipoles ( fig.1 ) , simultaneously arranged along all three orthogonal axes .    the effective hamiltonian for the interacting coherent dipoles @xcite    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are bose creation / annihilation operators of the local mode , @xmath5 is the energy of exciting a local dipole out of the correlated ground - state , and @xmath12 is @xcite : @xmath13    \\times \\exp \\left [ 2\\pi i{\\bf k}\\cdot \\left ( { \\bf r}_{0}-{\\bf r}_{i}\\right ) \\right]$ ] , where @xmath2 is the oscillating electric dipole moment , perpendicular to the wavevector @xmath14 which is along the ( 110 ) ( or equivalent ) direction , where modulations of the array of dipoles shown in fig.1 correspond to phonons of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath15 ( [ hloc ] ) which describes the effective interaction between localized modes can be diagonalized using the usual bogoliubov transformation . the new ground - state is a coherent state , where excitations have the energy spectrum : @xmath16 .",
    "the bare energy @xmath5 to flip a local - dipole out of the coherent ground - state is @xmath17 , i.e. twice the ground - state dipolar interaction energy .",
    "the empirical value of @xmath18k taken from nmr data @xcite therefore fixes the size of the coherent dipole moment @xmath19 . since the phonon is a modulation of the relative phases of the atomic motion , it is therefore equivalent to the excitation described by @xmath20",
    ". the agreement we find by comparing @xmath20 with the transverse t@xmath21(110 ) phonon data taken from inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , emphasizes the self - consistency of our description .",
    "further comparisons of this model with experimental data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the coherent ground - state defines a global phase and breaks the global gauge symmetry of a well - defined occupation number of local dipoles . in the limit @xmath22",
    "we find that the occupation number of the local - modes diverges as @xmath23 , signaling macroscopic bose - einstein condensation in the zero - momentum state : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the sound velocity of the t@xmath21(110 ) phonon which is the natural excitation of the dipolar array .",
    "this is just the order of divergency in the occupation number which is typical of an interacting bose system @xcite , where it can be related to the occupation of the zero - momentum state , i.e. , the condensate fraction @xmath26 : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the boson mass .",
    "since we describe local excitations whose total number is not a conserved quantity , their condensate fraction can not be simply defined .",
    "nevertheless the coherent dipoles do correspond to the behavior of the @xmath0he atoms so comparing the residues of the divergent part in these two expressions we find an effective condensate fraction : @xmath29 , where @xmath25 is @xcite @xmath30m / sec .",
    "we note that the condensation of the local modes is only in the directions ( 110 ) .",
    "this means that the limited ( vanishing in the t=0 case ) phase space volume will decrease the overall condensate fraction . at the bcc temperatures ( @xmath311.4k ) the one dimensional chains in the ( 110 ) directions",
    "are thermally broadened so that the condensation is now over finite volume sections of phase space .",
    "we can estimate this effect , and find a condensate fraction : @xmath32 .",
    "similar condensation of local dipoles along all three orthogonal axes of local zero - point motion means that there are three independent phases at each lattice site .",
    "the order - parameter can be described as a vector of three complex functions of independent phase : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the size of the coherent dipole moment .",
    "the bcc @xmath0he is therefore a system having both diagonal long range order ( dlro ) of the solid lattice and off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) of the local dipoles .",
    "it is not a super - solid @xcite in that it does not contain both a superfluid and a solid , but is more similar to the superconductors which have a dlro of the atoms in the lattice and odlro  of the superconducting electrons @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite on the behavior of implanted metallic atoms ( cs ) in solid @xmath35he reveal strong coherence effects in the bcc phase , in accordance with our expectation of a coherent state of dipoles .",
    "the condensation energy of the dipoles lowers the energy of the ground - state of the bcc phase and further stabilizes it with respect to the hcp phase @xcite : @xmath36 , which is negative since @xmath37 .",
    "we can estimate this sum at the finite temperature of the bcc phase : @xmath38mk per atom .",
    "this result is in agreement with the experimentally interpolated energy difference between the bcc and hcp phases @xcite of solid @xmath0he , which is of the order of a few mk per atom .",
    "in addition to the fluctuations of the phase of the coherent dipole ground - state ( i.e. t@xmath21(110 ) phonons ) , there can be a dipole - flip mode , where a dipole is in anti - phase ( phase difference of @xmath39 ) relative to the ground - state configuration of the dipoles .",
    "as we mentioned before , this is just the definition of the bare local - mode energy @xmath5 .",
    "such an excitation is naturally treated as a fermion since a flipped dipole is antisymmetric with respect to its ground - state configuration , that is with respect to the global phase of @xmath40 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing such a fermion should contain a term describing the creation and annihilation of pairs of fermions from the ground - state by a t@xmath21(110 ) phonon .",
    "in addition there is a term that describes the excitation energy of the bare fermionic localized - mode , i.e. @xmath5 . the effective hamiltonian that we therefore propose is @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the creation / annihilation operators of the flipped dipoles . in the absence of the second term",
    "we have just the bose ground - state rewritten in terms of fermion pairs .",
    "we linearize and solve the equations of motion that follow from ( [ diracham ] ) , similar to the bcs method @xcite , with the resulting energy spectrum : @xmath43 .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the energy spectrum @xmath44 compared with the other phonon modes in the ( 110 ) direction @xcite .",
    "no other optic - like phonons are expected in the bcc lattice .",
    "these predictions await high - resolution neutron , raman and x - ray scattering experiments to be compared with .",
    "note also that these excitations are confined to the ( 110 ) directions so despite their relatively low energy , they do not contribute significantly to the specific heat of the solid .",
    "we have identified a three component complex order parameter and bose - einstein condensation in the bcc solid phase , though not a super - solid @xcite . there can be further manifestations of the odlro of the dipoles in the bcc phase which we have not explored yet , such as macroscopic topological defects in this complex order - parameter .",
    "we further obtain that a locally flipped - dipole will behave as a fermion , with an optic - like branch in the ( 110 ) direction .",
