    "a major problem in modeling of encounters of galaxies is the extended parameter space which is composed by the orbital and the structural parameters of the interacting galaxies .",
    "traditional grid - based fitting strategies suffer from very large cpu - requirements .",
    "e.g.  for a restricted 7-dimensional parameter space ( an encounter of a disc with a point mass ) and a resolution of only 5 values per dimension , one needs 78125 models , or about 26 years of integration time on a grape3af special purpose computer for a ",
    "complete  grid .",
    "more systematic search strategies like gradient methods depend strongly on the initial conditions , which makes them prone to trapping in local optima . an efficient alternative approach",
    "are evolutionary methods and especially _ genetic algorithms _ ( holland 1975 , goldberg 1989 , charbonneau 1995 ) . in combination with fast ( but not self - consistent ) _",
    "restricted n - body_-codes ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) they allow for an efficient search in parameter space which can be used for both , an automatic search of interaction parameters ( provided sufficiently accurate data are available ) and/or a uniqueness test of a preferred parameter combination ( wahde 1998 , theis 1999 ) .",
    "the basic idea of gas is to apply an evolutionary mechanism including sexual reproduction operating on a population which represents a group of different parameter sets .",
    "all members are characterized by their fitness which quantifies the correspondance between simulations and observations . in order to determine the _ parents _ two individuals are selected according to their fitness .",
    "these parents represent two points in parameter space .",
    "the corresponding parameter set is treated like a _ chromosome _ , i.e.  it is subject to a _ cross - over _ and a _ mutation _ operation resulting in a new individual which is a member of the next generation .",
    "such a breeding is repeated until the next generation has been formed . finally , the whole process of sexual reproduction is repeated iteratively until the population confines one or several regions of sufficiently high fitness in parameter space .    here",
    "we present a parallel implementation of our genetic algorithm .",
    "we parallelized our code on the level of the ga by applying a master - slave technique using _ message passing _",
    "( mpi ) . on the master processor",
    "all the reproduction operations are performed .",
    "it sends the individual parameter sets to the slave processors which do the n - body simulations and determine the corresponding fitness values ( fig .",
    "the speed - up , i.e.  the ratio of cpu - times @xmath0 and @xmath1 used by a calculation with one or @xmath2 processors , respectively , reaches values between 30 and 60 for 100 processors ( fig .  1 right ) .",
    "the deviation from the optimal gain is mainly caused by the spread of cpu - times required for the individual simulations .",
    "it becomes more important with decreasing population size .",
    "by parallelization the whole ga - fit using 10000 models reduces to less than 3 cpu minutes on a cray t3e .",
    "thus , an interactive analysis becomes possible .",
