    "<S> diagonal and off - diagonal properties of 2d solid @xmath0he systems doped with a quantized vortex have been investigated via the shadow path integral ground state method using the fixed - phase approach . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen approximate phase induces the standard onsager - feynman flow field . in this approximation </S>",
    "<S> the vortex acts as a static external potential and the resulting hamiltonian can be treated exactly with quantum monte carlo methods . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex core is found to sit in an interstitial site and a very weak relaxation of the lattice positions away from the vortex core position has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> also other properties like bragg peaks in the static structure factor or the behavior of vacancies are very little affected by the presence of the vortex . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed also the one - body density matrix in perfect and defected @xmath0he crystals finding that the vortex has no sensible effect on the off - diagonal long range tail of the density matrix . within the assumed onsager feynman phase </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a quantized vortex can not auto - sustain itself unless a condensate is already present like when dislocations are present . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be investigated if backflow can change this conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> quantized vortices are one of the most genuine manifestation of the presence of superfluidity in many body quantum systems , but from the microscopic point of view no complete understanding of them has been reached yet . </S>",
    "<S> recently quantized vortices have been related to the supersolidity issue @xcite ; in fact , arguments in favor of a vortex phase in low temperature solid @xmath0he , preceding the supersolid transition , are appeared in literature @xcite . with respect to this possible connection one of the fundamental questions to be answered </S>",
    "<S> is : what does a quantum vortex look like in solid helium from a microscopic point of view ?    dealing with vortices is a really hard task for microscopic methods , and it calls for some approximations or assumptions [ 5 - 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the wave function has to be an eigenstate of the angular momentum , so it needs a phase . </S>",
    "<S> following the well established routine for the ground state , once chosen a variational ansatz for the wave function , one could be tempted to correct it by means of exact zero temperature quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately this is actually not possible because of the sign problem that affects qmc methods . </S>",
    "<S> the most followed recipe is to improve the variational description via qmc , but releasing the exactness of the methods in favor of approximations that allow to avoid the sign problem , like for example fixed phase @xcite or fixed nodes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we study here the properties of a single vortex in solid @xmath0he via the shadow - pigs ( spigs ) method with fixed phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the many - body wave function can be written as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a many - body phase , @xmath3 is the modulus of the wave function and @xmath4 are the coordinates of the @xmath5 particles . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 describes a quantum state of the system if it is a solution of the time independent schrdinger equation : from @xmath7 it is possible to obtain two coupled differential equations for @xmath2 and for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fixed phase approximation consists in assuming the functional form of @xmath8 as given and to solve the equation @xmath9\\psi_0(r ) = e\\psi_0(r).\\ ] ] for @xmath3 . solving ( [ schreff ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is equivalent to solve the original time independent schrdinger equation for the @xmath5-particle with an extra potential term @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest choice for the phase is the well known onsager - feynman ( of ) phase @xcite : @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the angular polar coordinate of the @xmath13-th particle ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is an eigenstate of the @xmath14 component of the angular momentum operator @xmath15 with eigenvalue @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the quantum of circulation . </S>",
    "<S> this choice for @xmath2 gives rise to the standard of flow field : in fact the extra - potential in ( [ schreff ] ) reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radial polar coordinate of the @xmath13-th particle .    in order to sustain a quantized vortex </S>",
    "<S> , the system should display a macroscopic phase coherence , and at @xmath20 k this means that solid @xmath0he should house a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known from qmc results that no bec is present in the perfect crystal [ 12 - 15 ] , but if the vortex turns out to be able to induce a bec it could be a self - sustaining excitation . on the other hand , it is largely accepted that defects are able to induce bec @xcite , and then a defected crystal can safely sustain a quantized vortex . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the study of a two dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0he crystal with and without dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , dislocations can be included in the 2d crystal without imposing boundary constraints @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the 2d system allows to reach large distances keeping the number of particle in the simulation at a tractable level , and this is a desirable feature when interested in off - diagonal properties of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> we face the task of solving ( [ schreff ] ) with the extra - potential given by ( [ pot ] ) when @xmath21 with the spigs method @xcite , which allows to obtain the lowest eigenstate of a given hamiltonian by projecting in imaginary time a swf @xcite taken as trial wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the spigs method is unbiased by the choice of the trial wave function and the only inputs are the interparticle potential and the approximation for the imaginary time propagator @xcite . as he - he interatomic potential we have considered the hfdhe2 aziz potential @xcite and we have employed the pair - suzuki approximation @xcite for the imaginary time propagator with time step @xmath22 k@xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> one difficulty with ( [ pot ] ) is that the potential is long range so that either one puts the system in a bucket @xcite or one should consider a vortex lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such complications can be avoided by multiplying @xmath24 in ( [ pot ] ) by a smoothing function @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the side of the simulation box ) so that standard periodic boundary conditions can be applied . with this choice , </S>",
    "<S> the extra - potential is equivalent to the of one only for @xmath27 , the provided @xmath28 is no more an exact eigenstate of @xmath15 but it is close to it in the interesting region of the vortex core if @xmath29 is large enough . </S>",
    "<S> here we have used @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations at @xmath31@xmath32 in a nearly squared box designed to house a perfect triangular crystal with @xmath33 lattice sites , and a crystal with 10 vacancies ( @xmath34 ) ; such vacancies in the initial configuration transform themselves in dislocations @xcite .     integrated vortex energy @xmath35 with error bars as a function of the distance from the core in perfect 2d solid @xmath0he at @xmath31@xmath32.,width=264 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : e2d ] we report our results for the integrated vortex energies @xmath36 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the energy of the particles that lie inside the disk of radius @xmath39 in the system with and without vortex ) as a function of the distance from the core in the perfect crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the center of mass of the system is not fixed , and we find that , independently on the starting configuration of the crystal , the vortex core sits in an interstitial site . we also find a very small relaxation of the surrounding lattice around the vortex core .     </S>",
    "<S> comparison between the radial defect distribution @xmath40 as a function of the distance from the origin ( vortex core when vortex is present ) for a 2d solid @xmath0he at @xmath31@xmath32 with ( filled symbols ) and without ( open symbols ) a vortex in the perfect ( circles ) and in defected ( squares ) crystal.,width=264 ]    in order to study the effects of the vortex on the crystal properties we have monitored the static structure factor , the pair distribution function and the radial defect distribution @xmath40 ( i.e. the distribution of the particle whose coordination is different from 6 as a function of the distance from the origin where the vortex core is located ) . in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : x2d ] we plot our results for @xmath40 both for the perfect and for the defected crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the defected case the radial defect distribution is about an order of magnitude larger than in the perfect one ; however , the results of the system with and without vortex are very close each other so that we conclude that the of vortex does not affect in a sensible way the disorder which behaves as in the system without vortex . </S>",
    "<S> we come at a similar conclusion for the crystalline structure , since both the static structure factor and the pair distribution function show no appreciable differences for the system with and without the vortex .     </S>",
    "<S> one body density matrix @xmath41 in 2d solid @xmath0he without ( open symbols ) and with ( filled symbols ) a vortex for the perfect crystal ( circles ) and for the crystal with dislocations ( squares).,width=264 ]    we have computed also the one - body density matrix @xmath41 for the perfect and for the defected crystal with and without the vortex in order to investigate the vortex effects on the off - diagonal properties . </S>",
    "<S> our results are reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : c2d ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 for the crystal with vortex are indistinguishable within the error bars from the ones obtained without vortex . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the of vortex is not able to induce a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the perfect crystal , or to increase the already present condensate fraction in the defected one .    </S>",
    "<S> since no bec is present in the perfect crystal and the of vortex is not able to induce it by itself , we can conclude that perfect 2d solid @xmath0he can not sustain vortices of the of type . </S>",
    "<S> thus the of wave function is a possible representation of a vortex in solid @xmath0helium only when bec is already present , like in a defected crystal . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results in three dimensional solid @xmath0he seem to confirm such conclusions for the of vortex .    in the liquid phase , the of phase </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been improved with the inclusion of back - flow ( bf ) correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of backflow increases @xcite at higher densities and it might well become dominant in the solid phase . </S>",
    "<S> computations along this line are in progress . </S>",
    "<S> since the bf terms acts mainly near the vortex core , we might expect that bf will not modify much the off - diagonal properties in 2d , where the vortex core is a point defect , while it could become relevant in 3d where the vortex core is an extended defect .    </S>",
