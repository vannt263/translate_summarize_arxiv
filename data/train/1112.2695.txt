    "in the investigation of spin - field perturbations on a curved spacetime , the ` retarded ' green function plays a crucial rle . for example , the full evolution in time of some initial data may be determined by integrating over space the ` retarded ' green function convolved with the initial data .",
    "also , the self - force acting on a point particle moving on a background spacetime may be calculated via an integration of the ` retarded ' green function over the whole past worldline of the particle  @xcite .",
    "similarly in quantum field theory the covariant commutation relations are determined by the ` advanced ' and ` retarded ' green functions . while in some contexts such as renormalization",
    "a knowledge of the short - distance behaviour of the green function is sufficient , in other contexts the knowledge of the global behaviour of the green function is important .",
    "the ` retarded ' green function for linear field perturbations of the schwarzschild black hole spacetime can be expressed as a multipole decomposition together with a fourier integral over the frequencies just above the real axis . in the impressive work of  @xcite , leaver deforms the frequency integral into a contour in the complex - frequency plane and he investigates three distinct contributions to the green function coming from : ( 1 ) a high - frequency arc , ( 2 ) the poles ( quasinormal modes ) in the lower plane , and ( 3 ) a branch cut ( bc ) along the negative imaginary axis ( nia ) . under a linear field perturbation , the high - frequency arc leads to a prompt response ; the poles lead to the well - known quasinormal mode ` ringing ' ( this ` ringing ' was observed for the first time in  @xcite ) ; the bc leads to , at least , a power - law tail decay with time  @xcite .",
    "while the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) have been extensively investigated , most work on the bc has been limited to small frequency on the nia ( and usually also large radial coordinates ) , which is precisely the regime that gives the power - law tail - see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the bc , however , is also expected  @xcite to have a significant contribution at ` early ' times , just after the start of the prompt response from the high - frequency arc .",
    "in fact , at ` very early ' times , i.e. , before the prompt response , the separate contributions from the high - frequency arc , qnms and bc might all separately diverge with their divergences cancelling each other out so that the complex - frequency contour integration is still valid .",
    "it is expected that these bc contributions at ` early ' and ` very early ' times come from the mid- and high - frequency regimes of the bc on the nia , which might also bring about other yet - unsuspected contributions . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", these mid- and high - frequency regimes of the bc have only been investigated , respectively , in  @xcite and in maassen van den brink s  @xcite , and it was done solely for the case of gravitational perturbations . in  @xcite ,",
    "maassen van den brink investigated the bc in schwarzschild for high - frequencies using a method based on an analytic continuation to the complex plane of the radial coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "this method is mirrored on the method used in   for the calculation of highly - damped qnms , i.e. , qnms for large overtone index @xmath2 , which therefore lie far down in the lower frequency plane .",
    "on the quantum side , highly - damped qnms have attracted considerable attention since attempts  @xcite have been made at linking them to the area quantization of a black hole  @xcite .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the imaginary part of the highly - damped qnms is shown to be related to the exponential redshift of the wave modes close to the horizon .",
    "in  @xcite , highly - damped qnms in kerr spacetime have been interpreted as semiclassical bound states along a specific contour in the complex-@xmath1 plane ; they speculate that qnms and another set of modes ( the so - called totally - transmitted modes ) correspond to different sets of microscopic degrees of freedom which , when they interact , produce hawking radiation . separately , in  @xcite they have shown that highly - damped qnms probe the short length scale structure of the schwarzschild black hole spacetime by calculating them in the context of a ` quantum - corrected ' black hole .    to set the current work in context we here give a succinct review of the -mostly- analytic results obtained in the literature for highly - damped qnm frequencies in the schwarzschild spacetime for various spin-@xmath3 fields .",
    "motl and neitzke   originally calculated analytically the leading - order of the highly - damped qnms for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xcite also predicted the dependence of their next - to - leading order term on the ` angular momentum number ' @xmath6 ) . subsequently , maassen van den brink  @xcite for @xmath7 and musiri and siopsis  @xcite for @xmath4 and @xmath5 confirmed the leading - order behaviour and obtained the next - to - leading order highly - damped qnms . in  @xcite",
    "they also give the leading - order for the imaginary part -though not for the real part- of the qnm frequencies for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . finally , in  @xcite they obtain the leading - order and next - to - leading order qnms for @xmath8 and @xmath11 . to the best of our knowledge , the leading - order for the real part of the qnm frequencies for @xmath12 and @xmath13 remains unknown , and only the leading order of their imaginary parts is known .",
    "the case of electromagnetic ( @xmath12 ) perturbations is particularly interesting since the real part of the spin-1 highly - damped qnm frequencies have been expected to approach the nia , thus hinting at an unexplored possible connection between the highly - damped qnms and the bc .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite they show that the real part of the electromagnetic qnm frequencies can only go at most like @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and in  @xcite they find numerical indications that it goes like @xmath16 , with a coefficient which is a 3rd order polynomial in @xmath17 ( with undetermined polynomial coefficients ) .",
    "we will confirm this behaviour and determine the polynomial coefficients in sec.[sec : qnms ] .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast with the @xmath18 behaviour of the corresponding qnm frequencies for @xmath4 and @xmath5 and faster - decaying than the @xmath19 for @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "see  @xcite for a thorough and recent review of qnms in different spacetimes ; see also  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , the contributions of the mid- and high - frequency regimes of the bc still remain largely unexplored . in the present paper",
    "we use the method in  @xcite ( which was restricted to @xmath7 ) to carry out an asymptotic calculation in the high - frequency regime of the bc contribution to the ` retarded ' green function in schwarzschild for fields of spin @xmath4 ( scalar ) and @xmath9 ( electromagnetic ) .",
    "we also calculate the highly - damped qnm frequencies for electromagnetic perturbations for the first time in the literature ( other than the leading - order of the imaginary part , which is known ) : we calculate these frequencies up to order @xmath21 , that is , leading - order for the real part and up to two orders after leading - order for the imaginary part .",
    "the feature that these qnms approach the nia ` so fast ' has made them very unyielding : like we show in this paper , in order to obtain the leading - order behaviour for large - frequency for spin-@xmath9 we are required to go up to two higher orders in perturbation theory than we are required for spins @xmath22 and @xmath5 .",
    "electromagnetic qnms are increasingly important , since the detection of the electromagnetic counterpart of the gravitational wave emission by astrophysical sources might play a valuable rle for localizing the source and obtaining further information about it  @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we also reproduce in this paper the results in  @xcite for the case of @xmath7 ( gravitational ) and in  @xcite for the corresponding spin-@xmath22 qnm frequencies .",
    "one particular physical application of the bc contribution to the ` retarded ' green function is the calculation of the corresponding contribution to the response of the schwarzschild black hole to some initial perturbation . in this paper",
    "we investigate the rle played by the high - frequency part of both the bc and the qnm contributions to such a response in the case of a spin-@xmath3(=0,1,2 ) field sourced by : ( 1 ) initial data of compact support and ( 2 ) a non - compact gaussian distribution in the ` tortoise ' radial coordinate .    in two other papers  @xcite",
    ", we will investigate , using completely different methods , the bc in schwarzschild in the mid - frequency and the small - frequency regimes along the nia . in most of the figures in the present paper",
    "we plot the various quantities required for the calculation of the bc contribution to the green function . in these figures",
    "we compare the high - frequency asymptotics obtained here with the results using the independent methods which we will present in  @xcite .",
    "the method in  @xcite has good convergence in a ` mid'-frequency regime which overlaps with the ` high'-frequency regime , as shown here ; it also overlaps with the ` small'-frequency regime , as we will show in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : bc gf ] we give the general formulae for the bc contribution to the ` retarded ' green function . in sec.[sec : large - nu ] we perform the asymptotic analysis of the bc green function for high - frequency along the nia . in sec.[sec : qnms ] we calculate the highly - damped qnms . in sec.[perturbation ] we investigate the contribution from the high - frequency regime of both the bc and the qnms to the black hole response to an initial perturbation . in sec.[sec : conclusions ] we present some conclusions .",
    "the ` retarded ' green function for linear field perturbations in the schwarzschild spacetime can be expressed in terms of a multipole decomposition together with a fourier transform as @xmath23={g_{\\ell}}(r,\\omega)\\frac{d{f_{\\ell}}(r,\\omega)}{dr_*}-{f_{\\ell}}(r,\\omega)\\frac{d{g_{\\ell}}(r,\\omega)}{dr _ * } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath1 are  respectively  the time and radial schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath26 is the so - called ` tortoise ' radial coordinate , @xmath27 is the radius of the event horizon , @xmath28 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath29 is the angle between the spacetime points @xmath30 and @xmath31 . note that the physical region @xmath32 corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "a bar over a quantity indicates that the quantity has been made dimensionless via an appropriate factor of @xmath34 , e.g. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , etc .",
    "the function @xmath38 is the wronskian of the two linearly independent solutions @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the following homogeneous radial ode : @xmath41 \\psi_{\\ell}(r,\\omega ) = 0 \\\\ & v(r)\\equiv \\left(1-\\frac{r_h}{r}\\right)\\left[\\frac{\\lambda } { r^2}+\\frac{r_h(1-s^2)}{r^3}\\right ] , \\quad \\lambda\\equiv \\ell ( \\ell+1 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath3 denotes the spin of the field : @xmath7 corresponds to axial  also called ` odd '  gravitational perturbations ( in which case eq.([eq : radial ode ] ) becomes the regge - wheeler equation  @xcite ) , @xmath12 to electromagnetic perturbations  @xcite and @xmath4 to scalar perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the ode eq.([eq : radial ode ] ) has two regular singular points at @xmath42 , @xmath34 and an irregular singular point at @xmath43 .",
    "these singularities in the ode generally cause the radial solutions to have branch points at @xmath42 and @xmath34 in the complex-@xmath1 plane . for real @xmath44 ,",
    "the solutions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are uniquely determined by the boundary conditions : @xmath45 strictly speaking , the limits in eq.([eq : f , near hor ] ) should actually be @xmath46 , but following standard conventions we denote them by @xmath47 , with a certain abuse of language .",
    "we also have @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are reflection and incidence coefficients , respectively .",
    "it is immediate that the wronskian is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq : f , near hor ] ) also define @xmath39 and @xmath40 unambiguously for @xmath52 when @xmath53 ; these solutions are then defined for @xmath54 by analytic continuation ( see  @xcite for details on the region of validity of these boundary conditions including @xmath55 as well as @xmath44 ) . on the nia ,",
    "the boundary condition ( [ eq : f , near hor ] ) becomes meaningless since it does not allow one to exclude the exponentially - decaying solution , @xmath56 for @xmath39 and @xmath57 for @xmath40 .",
    "we are therefore motivated to analytically continue to the complex-@xmath1 plane , and impose these boundary conditions in the regions @xmath58 for @xmath39 and @xmath59 for @xmath40 , where they define the solutions uniquely ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "leaver  @xcite has shown that @xmath60 has a branch cut ( bc ) which can be naturally taken to run along the line @xmath61 . if @xmath62 , then @xmath60 has a branch point at @xmath63 and a bc along the nia , @xmath64 . in",
    "@xcite they have shown that the existence of a bc in the complex-@xmath44 plane is linked to the asymptotic behaviour of the radial potential : the exponentially - decaying schwarzschild potential @xmath65/r_h^2 $ ] as @xmath66 leads to poles in @xmath39 on the nia ( these poles , however , are cancelled out in @xmath67 by the corresponding poles in @xmath38 ) , whereas its slower - than - exponential decay ( with the exception of the centrifugal barrier ) @xmath68 as @xmath69 leads to the bc in @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath39 does not have a bc in the complex-@xmath44 plane  @xcite , and so the bc of @xmath70 along the nia is due to the corresponding bc in @xmath40 .",
    "note that the wronskian @xmath71 , and therefore also @xmath72 , inherits the bc on the nia from @xmath40 ( see , e.g. , eq.128",
    "@xcite and eq.34  @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath73 ( and @xmath74 ) , which is positive along the nia .",
    "we also define @xmath75 for any function @xmath76 possessing a bc along the nia , where @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",
    "that is , @xmath79 is the discontinuity of @xmath80 across the nia .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath39 has poles on the nia ; these lie at @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( with the exception for @xmath7 of the algebraically - special frequency @xmath83 , defined below , which is not a pole of @xmath39  @xcite ) , and so it is convenient to define a new radial function : @xmath84 . accordingly",
    ", we define the wronskian @xmath85 $ ] .    from the radial ode eq.([eq : radial ode ] ) and the boundary conditions",
    "eq.([eq : f , near hor ] ) , there follow the symmetries @xmath86 these symmetries lead to @xmath87 so that the discontinuity of @xmath40 across the nia is only in its imaginary part .",
    "note also that although @xmath72 has a cut , @xmath88 does not have a cut .",
    "the bc contribution to the ` retarded ' green function is given by @xmath89    the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfy the same homogeneous , linear 2nd order differential equation ( namely , eq.([eq : radial ode ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 will also satisfy this same differential equation and it may be expressed as a linear combination of the solutions @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in addition , both @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfy the same boundary condition ( [ eq : f , near hor ] ) as @xmath95 : @xmath96 , and so @xmath92 will not satisfy this boundary condition . to understand this , note that the behaviour for @xmath95 of @xmath96 is dominant over that of @xmath97 , in @xmath92 the boundary conditions determine that the dominant terms cancel so that @xmath92 must be proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "finally , @xmath92 must be purely - imaginary from eq.([eq : symms g , w on nia ] ) and , since we know that @xmath94 is real - valued , it must be  @xcite that @xmath98 for some real - valued function @xmath99 which entirely characterises the bc ` strength ' .",
    "using eq.([eq : dg = qg ] ) , we can express the bc modes as  @xcite @xmath100    the second step is due to eq.([eq : symms g , w on nia ] ) , and we include the double subindex in @xmath101 because @xmath102 has no cut .",
    "we essentially follow the method of maassen van den brink  @xcite , who calculates the high - frequency asymptotics of @xmath39 , @xmath90 and @xmath99 on the nia for the case @xmath7 , to obtain the corresponding asymptotics for the cases @xmath4 and @xmath9 . for completeness",
    ", we will also include the results of  @xcite for @xmath7 .",
    "we now give a general description of the method .",
    "as described in the previous section it is convenient to impose the boundary conditions on @xmath40 and @xmath39 in the complex @xmath1 or @xmath55 plane .",
    "the relationship between these two planes is complicated by the existence of a cut in the interrelationship @xmath104 .",
    "of special importance to our analysis are the anti - stokes lines which for @xmath44 on the nia are defined as the curves on the complex-@xmath1 plane where @xmath105 . in this case",
    "there are four anti - stokes lines emanating from near @xmath42 and they have slopes equal to @xmath106 ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) . the full structure is illustrated in fig.[fig : antistokes](a ) .",
    "we have two linearly - independent wkb asymptotic expansions for large-@xmath108 , @xmath109 ; these expansions are valid for @xmath110 and away from the singularities @xmath42 and @xmath34 of the radial ode .",
    "the importance of the anti - stokes lines is that along them neither expansion , @xmath111 nor @xmath112 , dominates over the other .    the contour chosen for @xmath113 , illustrated in fig.[fig : antistokes](b ) , is as follows . by analytic continuation",
    ", we can impose the boundary condition for @xmath114 on the anti - stokes line going to @xmath115 on the upper complex-@xmath1 plane instead of imposing it for @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "one can safely match @xmath114 to @xmath112 for @xmath115 on that anti - stokes line ( i.e. , at point a of fig.[fig : antistokes](b ) ) since , there , @xmath112 does not dominate over @xmath111 .",
    "one can can then continue this expression from @xmath116 along the anti - stokes line down to a region near @xmath42 with @xmath117 .",
    "( i.e. , down to point b of fig.[fig : antistokes](b ) ) .",
    "however , one can not continue this expression from point b to @xmath118 since one would have to cross into a region where @xmath112 dominates over @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , instead we introduce two linearly - independent solutions @xmath119 , @xmath120 , whose behaviour we can determine analytically and which we can match to the solutions we are interested in .",
    "of course , we can not determine these solutions exactly but we can obtain them in the limit of large @xmath108 with fixed @xmath121 and this is sufficient for our purpose . in this approximation ,",
    "the solutions @xmath119 are expressed in terms of special functions which one knows how to analytically continue from one anti - stokes line to another .",
    "one then matches the solutions @xmath119 to @xmath122 along @xmath117 in a region of overlap , given by @xmath123 ( a region which includes point b of fig.[fig : antistokes](b ) ) .",
    "since one knows how to analytically continue @xmath119 around @xmath42 , with the matching done , one can analytically - continue @xmath124 from the anti - stokes line on @xmath117 to another anti - stokes line on @xmath125 and have it expressed as a linear combination of @xmath126 .",
    "this linear combination is safely valid along the anti - stokes line clockwise all the way to @xmath127 ( i.e. , point c of fig.[fig : antistokes](b ) ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath112 in this linear combination is 1 , and the coefficient of @xmath128 yields the asymptotics for the bc ` strength ' @xmath99 . from @xmath127 ,",
    "the linear combination is asymptotically valid on the physical line , either along @xmath129 or along @xmath130 , even though the coefficient of the subdominant solution in the corresponding region becomes meaningless .",
    "one can also find , using frobenius method , two linearly - independent series expansions , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , about @xmath42 .",
    "these expansions are valid for @xmath133 and so there is no overlap with the region of validity of @xmath126 ; the expansions @xmath134 do however provide a check for the solutions @xmath119 .    the contour chosen for @xmath135 , illustrated in fig.[fig : antistokes](c ) , is as follows .",
    "first , from its boundary condition as @xmath66 we know that at @xmath127 the solution @xmath135 has to be a linear combination of @xmath136 with the coefficient of @xmath111 ( which is the dominant wkb expansion on @xmath129 ) being equal to 1 .",
    "this linear combination of @xmath136 is valid anticlockwise along the anti - stokes line from @xmath127 up to @xmath125 . in order to obtain the coefficient of @xmath137 ,",
    "one re - expresses this linear combination as a linear combination of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , on @xmath125 , using the matching described above .",
    "one knows how to analytically continue this expression onto the anti - stokes line on @xmath140 , and there it can be re - expressed as a new linear combination of @xmath136 .",
    "one can then continue this linear combination anticlockwise along the anti - stokes line back to @xmath127 , thus yielding the asymptotic monodromy of @xmath39 around @xmath141 .",
    "the obtained asymptotic monodromy is then compared with the exact monodromy @xmath142 , which follows from the boundary condition on @xmath39 at the horizon .",
    "the comparison then yields the coefficient of @xmath112 that we wanted .",
    "let us note that in  @xcite they use a similar , but different , method to the one we use here . in  @xcite they make use of the stokes phenomenon , instead of the solutions @xmath119 , in order to continue from one anti - stokes line to another .",
