    "the largest column density absorption line systems [ @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 , known as damped ly@xmath1 absorbers ( dlas ) , were first observed in qso spectra , and originate in the regions of intervening galaxies . because background qsos probe random sightlines through intervening galaxies , qso - dla systems can in principle be used as an unbiased tracer of the neutral gas at high redshift , gas that provides the fuel for star formation at these epochs ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ; wolfe et  al .",
    "1995 ) , though complications regarding a bias against dusty lines of sight may possibly exist .    typically , metallicities are low in qso - dlas compared to solar metallicity , ( @xmath12 \\sim -1.5 $ ] at @xmath13 ) with a large scatter @xcite .",
    "dlas are also common in long duration @xmath14-ray burst ( grb ) afterglow spectra , typically with much higher column densities than observed in qso - dlas .",
    "it seems highly plausible , given that long - duration grbs are known to have massive star progenitors @xcite , that the extremely large neutral hydrogen column densities observed in many grb - dlas are related to the grbs star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this means that while the highest redshift absorption system in an afterglow spectrum belongs to the grb host , and is therefore unlikely to be useful as a random probe of intervening matter , it can instead provide rich information on the sites of active star - formation in the high - redshift universe . at the same time ,",
    "afterglow spectra can still be used as random probes for intervening absorbers at lower redshifts in the same way as qsos .",
    "the largest ly@xmath1 absorption columns in dlas are found in grb afterglows : grb030323 with @xmath15 and more recently @xmath16 in the afterglow of grb050730 .",
    "further data on the birth matrix of grbs are provided by studies of the afterglow s optical extinction and soft x - ray absorption .",
    "the optical studies provide an opportunity to constrain the extinction law for star - forming galaxies at high redshift , though the work may be complicated by the possibility of destruction of dust grains by the grb .",
    "indeed it has been proposed that grb afterglows are subject to a ` flat ' or ` grey ' extinction law due to a change in the grain size distribution caused by the sublimation and breaking of dust grains @xcite , i.e.  where there is evidence for little spectral reddening but where the presence of a significant dust column is inferred .",
    "proposed evidence for this includes large metal column densities observed in afterglows which exhibit little curvature in their optical afterglow spectra .",
    "the metal column densities are derived either from optical absorption lines ( where dust depletion effects have also been observed , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or from the soft x - ray absorption , where the most important contribution comes from oxygen k - shell absorption .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the metal column density and the optical reddening was first observed in a careful and seminal paper by @xcite , using very low quality x - ray spectra from _",
    "bepposax_.    the only alternative to a flat extinction law appears to be a non - universal dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "this would explain a high metal column density with little spectral reddening without reference to non - standard extinction laws , since there is simply less dust .",
    "a low dust - to - metals ratio appears a very natural possibility for grb host galaxies , given their high redshifts and very young stellar populations .",
    "this is because metal enrichment of the interstellar medium depends on supernovae ( sne ) which have short lifetimes , while the overwhelming mass of dust ( at least in the current epoch ) is not produced by sne , but by asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars that have lifetimes of at least one hundredmyr before even the most massive stars begin to produce quantities of dust @xcite .    to distinguish between these possibilities",
    ", we require a direct measure of the hydrogen ly@xmath1 , soft x - ray , and optical metal absorptions in a single grb afterglow , observations that have been elusive because of the conflicting requirements of a relatively low redshift for an accurate determination of the intrinsic soft x - ray absorption , and high redshift to move hydrogen ly@xmath1 to observable wavelengths .",
    "in this paper we present x - ray and optical observations of grb050401 (  [ observations ] ) , the resulting spectra and lightcurves (  [ results ] ) , and the implications of these observations (  [ discussion ] ) .    a cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 is assumed throughout .",
    "error ranges quoted are 68% confidence intervals for one parameter of interest , unless otherwise indicated .",
    ".optical and near - ir imaging observations [ cols=\"<,<,<,^ \" , ]        in the afterglow spectrum of grb050401 .",
    "we also show two more saturated / blended lines ( @xmath211526 and @xmath212344 ) that were not used in the line fitting .",
    "the origin of the velocity scale corresponds to the redshift @xmath22 . ]",
    "we note that there is an intervening absorption system at @xmath23 based on , , and lines .",
    "the metal lines in this system are strong but significantly weaker than those from the grb system",
    ". moreover , the lines from this system are not detected .",
    "it is not possible to estimate the column density from the ly@xmath1 line as there is no flux left from the afterglow around 4255 . assuming a metallicity of a tenth solar we estimate @xmath24hi@xmath25 .",
    "this intervening dla therefore provides a negligible contribution to the uncertainties on the absorbing column in x - rays or the dust extinction .    in the 2 dimensional spectrum",
    "we also identify a ly@xmath1 emitter at @xmath26 at an impact parameter of 10.2  south of the grb position ( 81.3kpc at @xmath26 , see the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly_alpha ] ) .",
    "there is no significant absorption in the afterglow spectrum at this redshift .",
    "there is also no evidence for ly@xmath1 emission from the host galaxy in the 2d spectrum , but as the host galaxy is not detected this does not exclude even a large equivalent width ly@xmath1 emission line from the host .",
    "the photon - weighted mean time of the wt - mode x - ray spectrum was 1075s after the burst .",
    "the flux of the optical spectrum was interpolated to this time , using the @xmath27 optical decay slope and the flux calibration of the spectrum .",
    "the best - fit to the r - band lightcurve is consistent with the flux interpolation of the optical spectrum to this time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the nir data were also corrected to this time , assuming their decay was the same as the r - band decay rate .",
    "the correction in the nir was less than for the optical spectrum since the nir observations occurred between 37 and 76 minutes after the burst .    the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) clearly shows that a break in the optical - to - x - ray spectral index is required even to fit a simple smc extinction - correction to the optical spectrum alone .",
    "larger absorption with less reddening would of course allow the optical spectrum to be fit if we assume an intrinsic optical slope that was a continuation of the x - ray slope .",
    "such an extinction would be consistent with the idea of a flat or ` grey ' extinction as advocated by @xcite , @xcite and among others .",
    "limits on the total extinction ( a@xmath28 ) for grb050401  were derived from the extreme cases of 1 ) a single power - law extrapolated from the x - ray spectrum to the optical ( @xmath29 ) and 2 ) a broken power - law with a @xmath30 ( giving @xmath31 ) , as expected from the fireball model @xcite , with the break set conservatively just inside the observed x - ray band ( 0.4kev ) .",
    "these limits on a@xmath28 are shown in the inset to fig  [ fig : extinction ] .",
    "it is notable that even a very flat extinction curve can not alone reconcile the upper limit to the extinction with the large metal column densities we observe .",
    "we discuss this conflict below .",
    "the optical afterglow of grb050401  is particularly faint  in fact it is the faintest grb afterglow for which an absorption line redshift has been obtained .",
    "the observed optical to x - ray spectral slope is flatter than expected for the fireball model , therefore grb050401  falls into the ` dark burst ' population as defined by @xcite .",
    "the observed reddening in the optical spectrum allow us to conclude that the ` dark ' nature of the burst can be explained by extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "it is interesting that the very high column densities observed in grb hosts , which are probably local to the grbs , means that we do not need to invoke very dusty environments to explain dark bursts  even with a small dust - to - gas ratio these very high column densities are sufficient to darken the afterglows .",
    "since we expect grb progenitors to be short - lived @xcite , the cloud probed by the afterglow is likely to be the matrix out of which the progenitor was born .",
    "for this reason , it may be problematic to try to infer the global properties of the ism at high - redshift from the grb s probable host dla .",
    "but for exactly the same reason grb - dlas are particularly important for determining the nature of the progenitor material of the grb . for instance , the favoured model of long duration grbs ( the  collapsar  , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , predicts that grbs should generally be found in low metallicity environments .",
    "alternative progenitor models exist where there is no such low metallicity preference ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous observations of grb afterglows and grb host galaxies have indeed suggested that grbs reside in low metallicity galaxies , and in fact the two next strongest grb - dlas after grb050401 have rather low metallicities .",
    "the absorbers in grb afterglows usually have high metal column densities , but relatively little reddening  this phenomenon has been attributed to a flat extinction law , often suggested to be due to destruction of dust grains .    here",
    "we have one of the first direct measures in a single grb of the column density and the total metal ( primarily @xmath1-element ) column density .",
    "if we assume that the x - ray and optical absorptions probe the same matter , and there is no evidence to the contrary , this allows us to constrain the metallicity from the x - ray measurement , suggesting [ x / h]@xmath32 , where most of the uncertainty is in the hydrogen column . using the best - fit to the optical absorption lines we find [ zn / h]@xmath33 .",
    "zn is one of the elements least affected by depletion onto dust grains , at least in warm clouds in the galaxy , and is also a good tracer of the fe - group metallicity . by fixing the hydrogen column density at the level of the optically - determined column and the fe - group elements at the level determined from the zn abundance",
    ", we can fit for the @xmath1-element abundance in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we obtain @xmath34 , which translates to [ @xmath1/h]@xmath32 , including the uncertainty .",
    "we can also directly obtain the ratio of @xmath1-chain metallicity ( from the x - ray spectrum ) to fe - group metallicity ( from the optical spectrum ) .",
    "this ratio may hint at a possible overabundance of @xmath1-elements to zn compared to solar : [ @xmath1/zn]@xmath35 ( a factor of about 45 ) .    in an analysis of qso absorption lines systems ,",
    "@xcite invoke an overabundance of @xmath1-chain to fe - group elements of 2.5 .",
    "such an overabundance is consistent with the results obtained here .",
    "indeed , this degree of @xmath1-element overabundance is consistent with the zn metallicity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and would indicate a relatively young ism still dominated by products from core collapse rather than type  ia supernovae @xcite .    from the optical measurements ,",
    "there is no evidence for an overabundance of si , which is also considered an @xmath1-chain element , compared to zn , with [ si / zn]@xmath36 .",
    "since si is depleted onto dust grains as discussed above , this ratio probably reflects differential dust depletion effects .",
    "evidence for dust depletion comes from iron for which we measure [ fe / zn]@xmath37 similar to the highest seen in qso - dlas @xcite .    in cold galactic clouds zn",
    "is depleted by about @xmath38 dex , so it is important to examine if the apparent alpha - element overabundance could be due to a large depletion of zn onto dust grains .",
    "we believe the depletion of zn is not large in this case , as the abundances of si , cr , and fe relative to zn in this system ( [ si / zn]@xmath36 , [ cr / zn]@xmath39 , [ fe / zn]@xmath37 ) are more similar to the element ratios in warm galactic clouds ( [ si / zn]@xmath40 , [ cr / zn]@xmath41 , [ fe / zn]@xmath42 ) than those in cold galactic clouds ( [ si / zn]@xmath43 , [ cr / zn]@xmath44 , [ fe / zn]@xmath44 ) . nevertheless , we can not exclude some depletion of zn onto dust and in this case the total metallicity would be higher if metal ratios were similar to the solar values ( [ x / h]@xmath45 ) .",
    "strictly , the derived @xmath1-element overabundance should hence be considered an upper limit .",
    "the optical spectrum is well fit using an smc extinction curve with a@xmath6 and an intrinsic slope ( before dust extinction ) of @xmath46 . with a slightly flatter slope of @xmath31 ,",
    "as expected from the x - ray slope @xmath47 and a cooling break of @xmath48 between the x - rays and the optical , the required extinction is slightly higher , a@xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : extinction ] ) .",
    "this reddening - derived estimate is somewhat less than might be expected from a simple translation of the optical or columns to extinction .",
    "these would respectively suggest a@xmath50 assuming an smc dust - to - hydrogen ratio , or a@xmath51 , following @xcite .",
    "the similarity of these latter two estimates is not surprising of course since the estimated metallicity in the smc is similar to the [ zn / h ] observed here .",
    "however , these estimates are strongly dependent on the metallicity and if some zn is depleted onto dust , the metallicity - estimated a@xmath52 could be substantially greater .",
    "a more robust , direct comparison can be made between the optical spectrum and the optical - to - x - ray sed , thereby placing bounds on the total and selective extinctions ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : extinction ] ) .",
    "a@xmath53 is excluded : it would require a non - power - law continuum in the optical which was also substantially below the continuum expected from the x - ray spectrum , even with a steep spectral break . on the other hand",
    ", we can also exclude a@xmath54 since it requires not only an extremely flat extinction curve , but also that the optical and x - ray afterglows are driven by different emission components ( e.g. that the x - ray emission is dominated by inverse compton radiation rather than synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "the absolute limits on the extinction ( @xmath55 ) and the extinction estimates based on metallicity and on reddening - fitting examined above , are all much less than the a@xmath52 inferred from the metal column derived from the soft x - ray absorption , which is @xmath56 .",
    "since the x - ray absorption is dominated by metals , the conversion from x - ray absorption to dust column is not sensitive to a gas - to - metals conversion , but to the dust - to - metals conversion . allowing an @xmath1-element overabundance as suggested above",
    "would not make these more compatible since it is the @xmath1-elements that compose most the dust .",
    "we are therefore forced to invoke a dust - to - metals ratio ( as distinct from the dust - to - gas ratio or the metallicity ) which is smaller in this dla than in the galaxy or the magellanic clouds . if the reddening - derived extinction measure is correct , this is more than a factor of ten less than the smc dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "but such a resolution to the low - reddening vs.  high metal column problem clashes with the apparent pattern of dust depletion observed above , as depletion at this level naturally implies the presence of a large dust column along with the gas .",
    "we are left with a paradox : we very clearly observe a large metal column density and insufficient total extinction ( and reddening ) implying a low dust - to - metals ratio , but at the same time we have some evidence of dust depletion effects in the ratios of the optical lines .",
    "this is puzzling .",
    "we can not exclude the hypothesis that there is a large dust column which has very little effect on the transmission of optical light . on the other hand it seems reasonable to say that the evidence for dust depletion ( 45@xmath57 in total ) may not be quite strong enough to support such a far - reaching conclusion .",
    "in that case we invoke a low dust - to - metals ratio as above .",
    "such a low dust content with a moderately high metallicity would indicate either sublimation of most of the dust along the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or more simply , that the dust observed in this dla system has been formed by sne rather than agb stars .",
    "this is because sne contribute metals and dust very quickly to the ism , but while they provide nearly all of the metals , they produce only relatively small amounts of dust ( sne produce at most only a few percent of the dust found in the local universe ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have reported the strongest damped ly@xmath1 line observed to date , in the spectrum of grb050401 .",
    "the metallicity is fairly high even for a grb - dla , with [ zn / h@xmath3=-1.0\\pm0.4 $ ] .",
    "large x - ray absorption is also detected , from which a large @xmath1-element column density is inferred .",
    "the extinction expected based on the x - ray absorbing column density exceeds the total extinction allowed by the sed in grb050401 , and is more than an order of magnitude greater than the extinction inferred from a good fit of the smc extinction curve to the reddening in the optical spectrum .",
    "a grey or flat extinction law can not explain this discrepancy .",
    "we suggest that since the metallicity is high , and the total extinction is low , it implies that there is comparatively little dust along the line of sight to this grb ( however there is puzzling evidence to the contrary in the depletion patterns of the optical absorption lines ) .",
    "this high metal column with little extinction may be evidence of dust destruction , or that the stellar population is very young and that little dust has been formed yet , in spite of the vigorous star - formation activity . based on these results , inferences on dust extinction properties drawn from comparisons of optical reddening and metallicity",
