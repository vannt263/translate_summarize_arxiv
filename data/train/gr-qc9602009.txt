    "the idea of representing physical objects by extended ones such as membranes , can be traced back to the pioneering work of dirac  @xcite . in this model for the electron ,",
    "tension forces tending to collapse the membrane were balanced by repulsive electric forces .",
    "later , canonical  @xcite and semiclassical  @xcite quantization of membranes in a flat background was considered . on the other hand , starting with the works of ",
    "t hooft  @xcite , a series of papers@xcite considered the quantum degrees of freedom of a black hole , localized around its event horizon .",
    "it is also worth noting the classical approach to black holes by the , so called , `` membrane paradigm '' , summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was considered the approach of effectively representing the quantum degrees of freedom of a black hole by a relativistic membrane .",
    "the total lagrangian of the system was composed of the classical curved geometry plus a relativistic bosonic membrane .",
    "the membrane , located at the `` stretched horizon '' , was decomposed into a spherically symmetric term plus small fluctuations around it .",
    "the first order fluctuations have then been quantized and the energy spectrum was obtained . from this , the entropy of the membrane at the temperature of the black hole ( given by the background geometry ) was computed .",
    "it was however left open the question of the existence and stability of the zeroth order solution representing a spherical membrane at rest very close to the black hole event horizon . in the present paper",
    "we address the above question .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we study the dirac membrane in its simplest form .",
    "no coupling to the electromagnetic field is considered , instead the membrane is let to freely move in a curved background .",
    "since our final aim is to study black hole properties , and for the sake of simplicity , we consider spherically symmetric backgrounds .",
    "we derive the condition for the existence of spherical membranes to be in equilibrium at a given radius @xmath4 .",
    "we also find the stability condition and apply it to a membrane in the schwarzschild  de sitter space .",
    "iii deals with a covariant description of small fluctuations around the equilibrium position @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the fluctuations are governed by a klein  gordon  like equation in the 2 + 1 dimensional world ",
    "volume swept by the membrane .",
    "we identify modes with angular momentum label @xmath5 as responsible for the instabilities in the schwarzschild  de sitter background . in sec .",
    "iv we study a more general membrane described by a lagrangian with up to quadratic terms in the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this introduces two more arbitrary constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in addition to the membrane tension @xmath8 .",
    "this freedom allows us , in the plain schwarzschild background , to choose @xmath4 as close to the event horizon as we want ( for instance at the stretched horizon ) .",
    "we study the radial small fluctuation equation ( fourth order differential equation ) and find the equilibrium and stability conditions . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the way of extending the validity of the perturbative approach around a maximum of the potential , instead of a minimum , when we take the comoving system of reference to describe the zeroth order motion . in appendix",
    "a we give the analytic expressions , corresponding to the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for the cosmological and event horizon , and @xmath4 in the schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime .",
    "let us consider the action of a dirac membrane ( with tension @xmath8 bearing dimension of @xmath9 ) in a curved background @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the induced metric on the world - volume @xmath12 the classical equations of motion derived from this action are @xmath13 where @xmath14    we shall consider in this paper static and spherically symmetric backgrounds ; this will simplify the analysis , but in principle one could carry out the study for more general backgrounds also .",
    "we then take @xmath15 the zeroth order solution representing a spherical membrane can be conveniently described by the following spherically symmetric gauge choice @xmath16 so that the induced metric on the world - volume becomes @xmath17 where a dot denotes derivative with respect to tau .",
    "notice that the gauge choice ( [ 1.3 ] ) does not fix completely the gauge for a spherical membrane .",
    "there is still one un - used reparametrization , which we shall return to in a moment .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the system takes the following simple form after integrating over @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 the temporal component of the equations of motion ( [ 1.2 ] ) is given by @xmath21 the corresponding integral , @xmath22 , has dimension of @xmath23  =  energy , when using units where @xmath24 but keeping newton s constant @xmath25 explicitly .",
    "let us define the proper time @xmath26 by @xmath27 this definition fixes the remaining gauge freedom for the spherical membrane .",
    "notice also that in a point - particle picture , the dimensionless constant @xmath28 would correspond to the energy per unit rest  mass ( at least in an asymptotically flat spacetime ) . introducing",
    "similarly the notation @xmath29 the equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) takes the form @xmath30 hence the effective potential can be read off @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that the spatial components of the equations of motion ( [ 1.2 ] ) are consistent with ( [ 1.5 ] ) , and they do not provide any further information .",
    "thus the dynamics of the spherical membrane is fully determined by eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) .",
    "the condition of the existence of a static spherical membrane @xmath31 ( an equilibrium solution ) is given by @xmath32 at @xmath33 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath34 that is to say @xmath35 while the condition for this membrane to be in _ stable _ equilibrium ( stable with respect to radial perturbations ; we shall consider arbitrary perturbations in the next section ) is @xmath36>0~. \\label{1.7}\\ ] ] it is remarkable that both conditions ( [ 1.6 ] ) , ( [ 1.7 ] ) are actually independent of the function @xmath37 at least as long as we stay to the regime where @xmath38 is spacelike ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it can now be easily shown by direct replacement into eq .",
    "( [ 1.6 ] ) that the simple assumption for the background metric given by the minkowski , schwarzschild or reissner  nordstrm metric , does not allow any spherical membrane to be in ( stable or unstable ) equilibrium outside the event horizon .",
    "this is easily understood from the physical point of view : the membrane tension acts in the direction of contracting the spherical membrane , so in the absence of any other internal degrees of freedom ( which is the case for the dirac membrane ) , a repulsive gravitational field would be necessary to support an equilibrium solution .",
    "the simplest physically interesting spacetime that admits solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 1.6 ] ) is de sitter spacetime , which in static coordinates corresponds to @xmath40 the equilibrium solution is given by @xmath41 , and it is unstable according to eq .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) .    however , as discussed in the introduction , we are mostly interested in black hole spacetimes .",
    "in fact , let us take the schwarzschild  de sitter metric in static coordinates .",
    "from now on we use planck units @xmath42 we thus have @xmath43 if ( and only if ) @xmath44 there is a black hole event horizon @xmath45 and a cosmological horizon @xmath46 @xmath47 and there is a unique solution @xmath4 to eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show the effective potential @xmath51 , and observe that the static spherical membrane sits at a local maximum of the potential .",
    "we thus see that the equilibrium membrane solution @xmath4 is unstable to radial perturbations .",
    "this can also be seen by checking that the condition  ( [ 1.7 ] ) is not fulfilled for any of the values of @xmath52",
    "to further understand the behavior of the membrane fluctuations and stability we will now adapt the covariant approach of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) for strings , to the present case .",

    "this essentially represents the fluctuations of the membrane perpendicular to the hypersurface where it lies .",

    "in fact , a similar observation was already made in ref .",
    "@xcite in the study of dynamical spherical membranes in de sitter spacetime .",
    "there , however , modes @xmath5 where not relevant since they represented changes in the energy and linear momentum of the membrane , and these where symmetries of the background geometry .",
    "that is however not the case here , since the black hole breaks lorentz invariance and the instability of the modes @xmath5 is physical .",

    "the discussion in the introduction , since it corresponds to the membrane being relatively close to the black hole event horizon , see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , so eventually we are left with only the zero - mode @xmath1 being unstable .",
    "we have seen that a cosmological constant can provide the necessary amount of repulsive gravitational field to ensure the existence of spherical membranes in equilibrium in a black hole background .",
    "furthermore , by appropriately choosing the dimensionless parameter @xmath81 the static membrane can be at any position outside the black hole event horizon",
    ". in particular , the static membrane can be at the stretched horizon , only a few planck lengths outside the black hole event horizon .",
    "however , in the latter case we must have a very large cosmological constant .",
    "more generally , the fact that @xmath4 rather follows the cosmological horizon and only approaches the black hole event horizon for large values of the cosmological constant , see fig .",

    "we shall consider extrinsic curvature corrections to the membrane action @xcite .",
    "they describe a membrane with finite thickness ( the dirac membrane is infinitely thin ) .",
    "we write the action in curved spacetime as ( where , in principle , @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants ) @xmath82~ , \\label{iv.1}\\ ] ] where the second fundamental form is defined in ( [ 3.3 ] ) and where @xmath6 and @xmath7 have dimensions of @xmath23 . in principle",
    ", we could also add a term proportional to the scalar curvature of the world - volume ; it would be of the same order in derivatives as the two terms involving the second fundamental form  @xcite .",
    "however , the purpose of the following analysis is to show that equilibrium solutions can now be obtained even without the presence of a repulsive gravitational field . that is to say , we will eventually consider membranes in plain schwarzschild spacetime . in that case , because the spacetime is ricci  flat , the scalar curvature of the world ",
    "volume is related to the two second fundamental form terms , via the gau ",

    "for the simple schwarzschild metric ( without cosmological constant ! ) corresponding to @xmath97 one does find @xmath98 solutions where a spherical membrane can be in equilibrium : in this case eq .

    "it remains open the question of the stability of this solution .",
    "a complete and covariant discussion of the stability properties of higher order membranes involves the expansion of the action ( [ iv.1 ] ) up to second order in fluctuations around a particular solution to the equations of motion .",

    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ! ) condition for this , is that both @xmath118 _ and _ @xmath119 however , that condition leads to @xmath120 which can not be fulfilled outside the black hole event horizon .",
    "thus any static higher order membrane in the plain schwarzschild background is unstable with respect to radial fluctuations .",
    "the main result of this section is that the higher order terms in the membrane action can ensure the existence of static spherical solutions in the background of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "thus we do not need the cosmological constant of secs .",
    "iii , or any other kind of repulsive gravitational field , for that matter .",
    "however , the problem of instability ( at least with respect to radial fluctuations ) remained . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss a way of by  passing these instability problems .",
    "in this section we will show that it is possible to avoid the instabilities by considering a dynamical ( contracting ) membrane instead of a static equilibrium membrane .",
    "we will perform the computations for a dirac membrane in the schwarzschild  de sitter background , i.e. the model considered in secs .",
    "however , the results of sec .",
    "iv , concerning the higher order membrane ( especially the existence of unstable static equilibrium solutions ) , strongly indicate that the following arguments can also be carried through for the higher order membrane in the plain schwarzschild background , that is to say , the presence of the cosmological constant does not seem to be essential .",
    "let us return to the potential ( [ 1.5 ] ) in the case of the schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime .",
    "it is apparent from    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that there are the following qualitatively different kinds of `` orbits '' for spherical membranes    if @xmath121 membranes are always `` over '' the potential barrier , and either expand for ever or contract towards the black hole , ending trapped by the singularity at @xmath122 .    if @xmath123 membranes might bounce if they are expanding and are `` inside '' the potential well , or if they are contracting but are `` outside '' the potential well .",
    "we are particularly interested in the intermediate case , i.e. @xmath124 of which we have analyzed the stability properties of the static equilibrium configuration @xmath31 in sec .",
    "however , for @xmath125 there is also a contracting solution as well as an expanding solution . for the static solution we have : @xmath126 @xmath127",
    "now consider a contracting solution with `` energy '' given by ( [ v.1 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in solutions contracting from a finite coordinate distance @xmath128 ( where @xmath129 ) towards @xmath52 the _ proper _ time to reach the summit of the potential barrier ( @xmath31 ) happens to be logarithmically divergent , and can be derived as follows from eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) @xmath130 where @xmath131 and we have taken the dimensionless variables @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "one can thus show that the proper time distance becomes infinite .",
    "in fact , @xmath134 where @xmath135 and the ellipsis stands for finite terms as @xmath136 .    we have stressed that this infinity occurs in the proper time description .",
    "this is clearly different from the infinite `` schwarzschild '' time it takes a particle to reach the event horizon ( while it only takes a finite proper time , even to reach the singularity ) .",
    "in fact , the above logarithmic divergence arises at a coordinate radius @xmath137 .",
    "this is a particular property of the schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime background , that generates a maximum in the effective potential of the membrane , and this does _ not _ occur for the dirac membrane in the plain schwarzschild geometry .",
    "on the other hand , the above discussion applies quite generally to any potential barrier possessing a maximum .",
    "the infinite time to reach the top of the potential is well  known in classical mechanics , for instance , an ordinary pendulum experiences the same process when going towards the vertical ( unstable ) position with precisely the energy corresponding to being in the static , unstable equilibrium position .",
    "the results of sec .",
    "iv show that the dynamics of the higher order membrane in the plain schwarzschild background is also governed by some kind of finite potential barrier , thus also in that case we can expect to find the above mentioned type of solution .",
    "we now consider fluctuations around the contracting dirac membrane in the schwarzschild  de sitter background , using equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) . in general , in the schwarzschild  de sitter spacetime @xmath138 so that for the contracting membrane with @xmath28 given by eq .",

    "the reason is that we now consider @xmath143 for arbitrary @xmath34 not only for @xmath144    we are particularly interested in the case when the membrane approaches a position close to the schwarzschild event horizon .",
    "this is the case when @xmath145 is close to the maximal value @xmath146 c.f .",

    "iii . from the above results follow that for such contracting membranes , _ all _ @xmath147modes are stable everywhere ( that is , for all @xmath38 ) during the contraction . at first sight",
    "it seems , on the other hand , that the zero - mode is always unstable .",
    "however , for a contracting spherical membrane , the zero - mode does not represent a real physical fluctuation .",
    "the zero - mode merely represents a time - translation , and therefore should be eliminated from the spectrum .",
    "we thus conclude that _ all _ physical fluctuations around the contracting membrane are stable .    to actually compute the classical and quantum spectrum of physical fluctuations ( @xmath148 we must solve the equation @xmath149 where @xmath150 is given by ( [ v.9 ] ) , and @xmath151 is obtained by inverting ( [ v.3 ] ) .",

    "<S> . we shall discuss a way of by  passing these instability problems , and we also relate our results to the recent ideas of representing the black hole event horizon as a relativistic bosonic membrane . </S>"
