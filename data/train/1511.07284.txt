    "deterministic spin chaos has been recently detected in laser diodes  @xcite , promising impressive applications in the field of information encoding and transmission , fast random number generation , cryptography , etc .",
    "@xcite today , however , only a low - dimensional chaotic evolution of optical spin is achieved ; also known are externally shaped  @xcite as well as spontaneous @xcite spin patterns . in this work",
    "we address the problem of making spin of light reveal a _",
    "spatiotemporal _ chaos ( @xcite ) , similar to turbulent fluids with high - dimensional chaotic attractors .",
    "we have found that light with such properties can be emitted by the system of cavity polaritons , half - light half - matter excitations in microcavities .",
    "cavity polaritons are composite bosons originating due to the strong coupling of excitons ( electron - hole pairs in semiconductors ) and cavity photons  @xcite .",
    "they are known to form macroscopically coherent states in two ways .",
    "the first is bose - einstein condensation , occurring as a phase transition under nonresonant optical pumping  @xcite .",
    "the other way is direct resonant and coherent driving that immediately governs both density and phase of a _ highly nonequilibrium _ polariton condensate  @xcite . since excitons are strongly coupled to externally driven cavity photons , they share a unified quantum state rather than just constitute a nonlinear medium for propagating light",
    ".    it has long been accepted that chaotic polariton states are feasible only in inhomogeneous systems and appear due to the josephson effect .",
    "josephson oscillations in superconducting junctions occur between coupled coherent modes whose phase difference varies with time  @xcite ; analogous phenomena were observed in bose - einstein condensates of cold atoms  @xcite and cavity polaritons  @xcite .",
    "the josephson effect is , however , hardly possible in spatially homogeneous condensates formed under resonant plane - wave driving .",
    "polaritons have very small lifetime , hence a constant harmonic pump force makes them oscillate at exactly the same frequency , similar to a usual damped pendulum .",
    "since the spin - up and spin - down components have constant phase difference , their interchange  often referred to as intrinsic josephson effect  @xcite  is also prevented .",
    "such a system can only be _",
    "multistable _",
    "@xcite because of the polariton - polariton interaction .",
    "switches between distinct steady - state branches reveal themselves as sharp jumps in the cavity field @xcite .",
    "thus , the very short lifetime of polaritons ( @xmath0s in gaas - based microcavities ) makes them interesting in view of fast optical switches , but on the other hand , it usually forbids long - lived transient or unsteady states in a spatially homogeneous and truly constant environment .",
    "here we report a mechanism lifting the above limitation .",
    "we consider an internally homogeneous spinor polariton system pumped at normal incidence and show that its well - known multistable behavior can be turned into deterministic chaos .",
    "this happens when a spontaneously broken spin symmetry of the condensate ( @xcite ) starts being restored through bogolyubov excitations , which essentially relies on the non - hermitian nature of polaritons and would be impossible in ordinary bose - einstein condensates close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "previously , both oscillatory  @xcite and chaotic  @xcite polariton states were theoretically considered in a double - well geometry resembling a josephson junction .",
    "the josephson oscillations of polaritons were observed under non - resonant excitation  @xcite .",
    "it is also reported that the combination of spatially separated resonant and nonresonant pump sources is capable of producing a chaotic spin state at a certain location  @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are limited to particular excitation geometries and deliver only low - dimensional chaos . in its turn , our mechanism ensures a spatiotemporal spin chaos in arbitrarily sized polariton systems , from pointlike micropillars to uniform planar cavities .",
    "the following section  [ sec : model ] describes the model and the instabilities leading to the chaotic behavior which is then analyzed in the cases of pointlike systems ( sec .  [",
    "sec : pointlike ] ) and large cavities ( sec .",
    "[ sec : space ] ) .",
    "coherent polariton states are described by the spinor gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite , @xmath1 a pair of macroscopic wavefunctions @xmath2 depend on time and spatial coordinates in a two - dimensional active cavity layer . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spin - up and spin - down components connected directly with the right ( @xmath5 ) and left ( @xmath6 ) circular polarizations of the output light .",
    "@xmath7 is the polariton - polariton interaction constant .",
    "polaritons with parallel spins repel each other ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , which results in a blue shift ( @xmath9 ) of their resonance energy .",

    "operator @xmath13 implies the dispersion law common for both spin components ( see appendix  [ app : model ] ) ; @xmath14 is the decay rate .",
    "the eigenstates at @xmath15 are polarized linearly in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions so long as @xmath18 by definition , and @xmath19 is the splitting between them .",
    "the incident light wave ( `` pump '' ) has spinor amplitude @xmath20 , frequency @xmath21 , and a zero in - plane momentum ( @xmath22 ) , so that it falls perpendicular to the cavity .",
    "let us finally assume @xmath23 ; then the pump is @xmath16-polarized and the equations for @xmath3 and @xmath4 become exactly the same .",
    "the plane - wave solutions with @xmath22 have the form @xmath24 for both spin components",
    ". such solutions always exist in a spatially homogeneous system , however , they can be unstable .    the exact spin symmetry ( @xmath25 ) can be spontaneously broken if @xmath26 and @xmath27 exceeds both @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "this is a purely dynamical effect , unlike equilibrium phase transitions described by the landau theory . with increasing field density",
    ", the threshold is reached where both @xmath30 and @xmath31 tend to jump sharply , which is attributed to bistability  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the spin coupling ( @xmath32 ) makes one of the @xmath33 components inhibit or feed the other depending on their phase difference that , in turn , depends on the amplitudes . as a joint effect , it appears that near the threshold an indefinitely small addition to one of @xmath30 or @xmath31 triggers its further growth and the drop of the other component , so that the condensate switches to the state with either right or left circular polarization .    in the previous experiments",
    "@xcite , splitting @xmath34 was comparable to decay rate @xmath14 , and the condensate states with broken spin symmetry were stable under constant excitation conditions .",
    "here we assume that @xmath34 exceeds @xmath14 several times ( e.g. , due to a lateral strain ) , which alters the system behavior drastically .",
    "the spin - asymmetric condensate becomes unstable with respect to the scattering into two modes that are separated from it by finite energy gaps @xmath35 and have the same momentum @xmath22 .",
    "the two scattered modes are in fact two pairs of coupled same - energy yet opposite - spin bogolyubov excitations whose coupling and instability are reachable only at sufficiently large  @xmath34 .",
    "this differs from the known polariton - polariton scattering processes in which `` signal '' and `` idler '' have distinct momenta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more details and mode diagrams are presented in appendix  [ app : stability ] .",
    "thus , both the spin - symmetric ( @xmath36 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath37 ) one - mode condensate states can be unstable .",
    "the two instabilities meet at , roughly , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 being the pump detuning from the unsplit polariton level , @xmath41 . when these conditions are satisfied , no one - mode states are stable in a finite interval of  @xmath12 , irrespective of the dispersion law and mode structure .",
    "this leads , on one hand , to a chaotic behavior of the `` dispersionless '' polariton condensates in cavity micropillars .",

    "hence , the model is @xmath71-invariant , i.e. , rotationally symmetric .",
    "let us note that the anisotropy implied by both the splitting @xmath72 and @xmath16-oriented pump polarization is reflected only in phase difference @xmath49 .",

    ", the system comes to a steady but highly nonuniform state in which the continuous @xmath71 symmetry is broken together with the spin symmetry .",
    "such solutions are established in hundreds of picoseconds and are spontaneous in that a small fluctuation coming at a critical stage would result in a completely different picture .",
    "they are self - organized , i.e. , ordered internally , and always `` preferred '' over rapidly varying homogeneous solutions if it is ever allowed dynamically .",
    "the scale of inhomogeneity is deduced from the wave numbers @xmath75 of the scattered modes . the parametric scattering _ from _ the condensate always precedes and mediates its switches to high - energy states in bi- or multistable polariton systems  @xcite . in accordance with the dispersion law and phase - matching conditions , in our system",
    "@xmath76 may vary from 0 to @xmath77 depending on @xmath2 ( see appendix  [ app : stability ] ) . correspondingly , the cavity field is inhomogeneous on the scale of several microns irrespective of  @xmath78 .",
    "the very intriguing feature of the self - organized cavity field is that it arranges itself into a bunch of wires that have alternating @xmath62 and are separated by low - intensity regions .",
    "this effect originates in the free flow of polaritons combined with their repulsive interaction , which becomes especially pronounced in spatially distributed bistable systems . for instance , if the switch to the `` on '' state in such a system proceeds locally , the polariton flow triggers a chain of analogous switches in neighboring places , and eventually the `` on '' state with a particular spin spreads as far as possible  @xcite . in our system ,",
    "the polariton flow acts to expand and , thus , homogenize both the spin - up and spin - down high - density regions . as a result ,",
    "given that flat and `` rapid '' two - dimensional patterns are ruled out in favor of self - organized steady states , the only possible outcome of the spin expansion is a set of long - ordered quasi - one - dimensional wires .",

    "the spin wires are inevitably destroyed at larger field densities .",
    "they always tend to expand in all directions , and so the chaotic dynamics is restored as soon as sufficiently broad homogeneous patterns return in the field distribution .",
    "such patterns are comparatively narrow in the @xmath79 space and , hence , internally unstable due to the same reason as the one - mode solutions considered above in secs .",
    "[ sec : model ] and [ sec : pointlike ] . figure  [ fig : turbulence ] shows the evolution over a 0.1  ns interval starting at 2.5  ns after the constant pump has been switched on ; it is obtained at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the field structure reveals spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "it is highly sensitive to fluctuations at all times rather than only at a certain critical stage of pattern formation . at every instant ,",
    "an arbitrary small and short - range fluctuation would lead to an exponentially divergent evolution branch . as a result , each given location within the cavity plane shows the chaotic behavior .",
    "thus , beyond a certain critical scale @xmath82 the cavity field can not be at once steady and spatially homogeneous ; furthermore , the inhomogeneous steady states lose stability at higher field densities .",
    "an example of a limit - cycle solution with a spontaneous reduction of the @xmath71 symmetry down to @xmath83 for @xmath84 m is analyzed in appendix  [ app : periodic ] ; it is an intermediate stage between pointlike states and large two - dimensional cavities . with increasing size ,",
    "closed periodical trajectories cease to exist .",
    "it is reasonable that the degree of complexity of such systems infinitely grows with @xmath78 , in analogy to turbulent fluids  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is substantiated , first , by perfectly deterministic character of the model , i.e. , the mere fact that complexity does not come from the outer sources of entropy like thermal reservoirs , random potentials , or stochastic forces . on the other hand ,",
    "enlarging extent does enrich at least a statistical diversity .",
    "numerical estimates show that the first - order spatial correlation function drops rapidly with increasing distance beyond @xmath82 , which suggests statistical independence of remote locations .",
    "nonetheless , the geometry of the high - dimensional chaotic attractors in cavity - polariton systems invites further investigation .",
    "in summary , we have found the mechanism making spin of light behave as a turbulent fluid .",
    "the key point is the spontaneous breakdown of spin symmetry , which brings about an extreme sensitivity to fluctuations in a resonantly excited polariton system .",
    "the scattering into bogolyubov modes acts to close the cycle and triggers an infinite series of spin switches .",
