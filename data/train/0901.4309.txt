    "complex plasmas are gas plasmas consisting of electrons , ions , and neutral atoms that additionally contain microscopic particles with sizes ranging from @xmath0 nm to some @xmath1 m .",
    "this state of matter is ubiquitous in space , e.g. in the interplanetary medium , in interstellar clouds , in comet tails , and in the ring systems of the giant planets as well as in mesospheric noctilucent clouds @xcite . at the same time , in microchip manufacturing , avoiding particle contamination during the many production steps that involve plasmas is a technological challenge @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth , transport , and deposition of nanoparticles is the central goal of many plasma deposition techniques , e.g. in the manufacturing of amorphous solar cells @xcite . since the early 1990s ,",
    "research in complex plasmas is rapidly evolving .",
    "the original name dusty plasmas is nowadays often replaced by `` complex plasmas ''  in analogy to complex fluids , in order to emphasize many fundamentally different properties of this medium that distinguish it from ordinary gas plasmas .",
    "the field of complex plasmas is now maturing and the interested reader can find timely monographs , e.g. on dusty plasmas in space @xcite , technological applications @xcite , or on waves in dusty space plasmas @xcite .",
    "the microparticles in complex plasmas are electrically charged by collection of plasma electrons and ions as well as by photoemission or secondary electron emission @xcite . in laboratory plasmas",
    "usually the collection processes dominate and the particles attain a high negative charge of a few thousand elementary charges . to some extent , complex plasmas behave like negative ion plasmas . in both cases a heavy ,",
    "negatively charged species substitutes part of the electrons and thus affects the mobility and the contribution to shielding by negative charges .",
    "most ordinary plasmas in space and laboratory are weakly coupled , which means that the interaction energy of nearest neighbours is much smaller than their thermal energy .",
    "this situation is completely different in complex plasmas with micrometer sized particles which then become strongly coupled @xcite : the negative charge can be so large that the interaction energy of nearest neighbours exceeds their thermal energy by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a consequence of strong coupling is the formation of liquid or solid phases . in 1934 ,",
    "a liquid to solid phase transition had been predicted by eugene wigner for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron gas in metals at low temperature and low density due to strong coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "this phase transition became known as wigner crystallization , and the solid phase as wigner or coulomb crystals .",
    "this kind of crystallization has been studied for decades in a varity of systems ranging from electrons trapped on top of liquid helium @xcite , electrons trapped in semiconductor quantum wells @xcite and quantum dots @xcite , strongly coupled radio - frequency discharges of dusty plasmas @xcite , hole crystallization in semiconductors @xcite to laser - cooled trapped ions in paul- and penning traps @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that these physically completely different systems exhibit very similar collective behavior which is due to the governing role of the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "what makes the dust systems particularly attractive is that here collective phenomena , such as crystallization , occur at a comparatively large length scale of several millimeters and at room temperature which makes detailed experimental investigations rather simple .",
    "the formation of ordered solid phases in dusty plasmas was predicted by ikezi @xcite and first observed as plasma crystals in the early 1990s @xcite . since then",
    "crystalline structures and dynamical processes have been observed in a variety of confinement geometries ranging from 1d to 3d , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview and additional references .",
    "the present review will focus on the 3-dimensional spherical dust crystals recently observed by arp et al . @xcite .",
    "their crystalline structure was found to be very similar to those observed before in ion crystals in paul traps and the crystals which have been predicted to exist in expanding neutral plasmas @xcite .",
    "compared to the latter , the advantage of these so called yukawa balls is that the individual particle positions and trajectories can be directly visually observed and traced and recorded with video cameras . as a result ,",
    "very detailed comparisons to theory and computer simulations can be performed which go far beyond comparisons in more traditional plasmas .",
    "in particular , the comparison is not limited to average quantities such as distribution functions on long time scales , but also covers correlation effects , fluctuations , and even short - time effects become accessible .    thus , the aim of this review is to show , on the example of yukawa balls , that complex plasmas are an excellent object to study in great detail static and dynamic phenomena in finite systems such as ground and metastable states , transitions between configurations and phase transitions .",
    "these properties have , in the past few years , been studied in a very close connection between experiment , theory and computer simulation . for this purpose",
    "the review is organized as follows : in section [ s : experiment ] we discuss the experimental realization of the yukawa balls .",
    "then , in section [ s : theory ] we give an introduction to the theory and computer simulations and discuss the low - temperature structural properties of yukawa balls .",
    "section [ s : transitions ] is devoted to finite temperature excitations of the crystals , to structural transitions and the melting behavior .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion of the results and an outline of further research directions in sec .  [ s : dis ] .",
    "to realize and investigate spherical @xmath2d dust clouds two ingredients are indispensable : an isotropic confinement to prevent coulomb explosion of the alike charged particles and powerful 3d diagnostics . for a detailed report on the progress in the field of 3d diagnostic tools we refer the reader to @xcite",
    "here , we will limit the discussion to dust confinement , because the shape of the confinement potential is a central input parameter for theory and simulation .    to confine dust particles inside a laboratory plasma reactor ,",
    "the gravitational force has to be balanced .",
    "thus , dust confinement is typically achieved in the plasma sheath region above an electrode where strong electric fields are present @xcite .",
    "the trapping of the dust particles in horizontal direction is established by depressions of the electrode surface @xcite or flat metal rings on the electrode @xcite . however , this results in a very anisotropic confinement potential .",
    "the confinement in vertical direction is much stronger and thus these dust clouds are mostly 2d systems which nevertheless can form highly ordered crystals with a hexagonal lattice structure @xcite .",
    "further , the supersonic ion flow towards the electrode is focused below each particle @xcite . in multilayer systems",
    ", the resulting positive space - charge attracts particles in a lower layer .",
    "this process is responsible for chain formation observed in all dust clouds which are confined in regions of strong electric fields , i.e.  regions with strong ion flows .",
    "this alignment vanishes if small particles and high gas pressure are used @xcite .",
    "however , extended homogeneous 3d plasma crystals can not be generated this way and investigations of dust dynamics are not feasible due to strong damping .",
    "to produce extended 3d dust clouds , various approaches were followed .",
    "merlino and coworkers confined dust in a magnetized anodic plasma @xcite and investigated dust acoustic waves . later , similar experiments on dust dynamics were performed in other discharges @xcite . to produce 3d plasma crystals ,",
    "a number of experiments have been performed under microgravity conditions .",
    "these experiments have provided many interesting observations , e.g.  of localized crystalline structures @xcite , of complex plasma boundaries @xcite , of coalescence of complex plasma fluids @xcite , of transport properties @xcite , and of low - frequency waves and instabilities @xcite . however , the most striking observation was the formation of a dust - free zone ( void ) in the center of the discharge @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that the ion drag force is responsible for the formation of voids @xcite , and a combination of simulations @xcite , experiments @xcite , and recent ion drag models @xcite were able to verify this .",
    "although it was shown very recently that a void closure can be achieved @xcite , the formation of void - free crystalline dust clouds is still an important issue .",
    "such dust clouds in a well defined confinement would allow to extend a large fraction of the successful research on 2d plasma crystals to 3d .",
    "interesting observations were reported by annaratone and coworkers @xcite who observed spherical dust clouds with less than @xmath3 particles in a secondary discharge in front of an adaptive electrode .",
    "unfortunately , these clouds are rather in a liquid state and their confinement is not yet understood .",

    "the vacuum vessel is grounded and kept at room temperature .",

    "the particles basically arrange in a hexagonal lattice . after ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=95.0% ]    a different approach to confine void - free dust clouds is motivated by experiments , simulations and theories on void formation @xcite .",
    "those results showed that a void - free dust confinement at moderate plasma densities is hampered by the inherent ion flows towards the discharge boundaries . as a consequence , arp and coworkers @xcite",
    "have modified the usual setup of an asymmetric capacitively coupled rf - discharge [ fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_exp_setup](a ) ] . to establish a vertical temperature gradient",
    "the rf - electrode was heated to @xmath5c .",
    "the grounded vacuum vessel was kept at room temperature .",
    "the resulting thermophoretic force should balance gravity for particles with a radius @xmath6 m , i.e. allow for dust levitation in the bulk plasma .",
    "in addition to the experimental setup used by rothermel @xcite , arp et al . proposed to place a glass box with square cross section on the electrode that was left open at the top and at the bottom . for low discharge power ( @xmath7w ) , they discovered that dust , which was dropped into the glass box , formed spherical void - free clouds @xcite .",
    "a picture of a laser illuminated dust cloud ( yukawa ball ) consisting of roughly @xmath8 dust particles is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_exp_setup](a ) . already if only the front of such a dust cloud was illuminated with a laser sheet , interesting structural properties",
    "were observed [ fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_exp_setup](b ) ] .",
    "the particle arrangement was static and particles on the surface of yukawa balls seemed to have preferably @xmath9 or @xmath10 nearest neighbors .",
    "moreover , the particles did not form vertical chains , i.e.   first evidence was found that the yukawa balls were in a solid or even crystalline state .        to achieve a quantitative description of the dust confinement , fluid simulations with the siglo-2d code @xcite in combination with additional experiments were performed @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_confinement ] .",
    "it was found that thermophoresis alone was not sufficient to explain the confinement [ fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_confinement](a ) ] . by means of particle imaging velocimetry ( piv )",
    "experiments the thermophoretic force field was measured [ fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_confinement](b ) ] .",
    "it was found that thermophoresis contributed about @xmath11 percent to the vertical confinement and that the radial confinement and the remaining @xmath12 percent in vertical direction were provided by plasma induced forces , namely electrostatic fields due to surface charges on the glass @xcite .",
    "further , the fluid simulations showed that the yukawa balls were confined in a region where the plasma production was negligible .",
    "due to the low plasma density ( @xmath13 ) and the weak electric fields the ion drifts were significantly below the ion sound speed .",
    "the resulting ion drag force was about two orders of magnitude smaller than the electrostatic confinement force and could , therefore , be neglected and chain formation is not expected .",
    "the confinement provided by the combination of gravity , thermophoresis and electric fields is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_confinement](c ) and is in very good agreement with the experimental observations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_confinement](a ) ] .",
    "it yields the correct levitation height , its depth is sufficient to trap particles with a few thousand elementary charges and even its asymmetry was observable for huge clouds in the experiment @xcite .    for further structural analysis and especially for comparison with simulations as well as with other strongly coupled systems , it is important to note that the trapping potential is essentially isotropic and parabolic for dust clouds with a radius of less than @xmath14 mm , i.e.  @xmath15 particles .",
    "furthermore , for the trapping process an interaction of dust and plasma , as proposed by totsuji @xcite , is not required .",
    "the particle trap is provided by external forces only and thus this trap geometry is closely related to those of penning and paul traps @xcite .",
    "this allows for a direct comparison of the structural properties of yukawa balls and e.g. trapped laser - cooled ions .",
    "a theoretical description of complex plasmas is very complicated , due to the large number of different particle species , which include electrons , ions , neutrals and dust particles , and their huge difference in mass .",
    "thus the length and time scales of the motion of the different particles differ by many orders of magnitude , making a selfconsistent modeling unfeasible .",
    "the most advanced computer models use particle in cell ( pic ) simulations with a full account of the time - dependence of the discharge.@xcite .",
    "however , this currently allows to treat only a very small number of dust particles in the plasma environment .",
    "a simplified model which treats the streaming electrons and ions within linear response and computes the dynamically screened potential of the dust particles was developed by joyce and lampe , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "both simulations yield an anisotropic and non - monotonic ( wake ) potential around a dust grain if the ion streaming velocity exceeds the sound speed which is normally the case in the plasma sheath . at the same time",
    ", simulations for the conditions of yukawa balls which are produced in the plasma bulk revealed that there the streaming velocities are much lower and the dust - dust interaction is nearly isotropic and statically screened .",
    "it is , therefore , well approximated by a yukawa potential .",
    "these findings justify the use of a much simpler theoretical model which is discussed in the following sections .",
    "a standard model to describe the yukawa balls and their dynamics is based on the hamiltonian @xmath16 containing kinetic energy , a confinement and the interaction energy .",
    "the isotropic and parabolic confinement is based on the experimental results , cf .",
    "[ s : experiment ] .",
    "@xmath17 is the particle charge and @xmath18 the confinement strength . for both values",
    "the experiment sets rather narrow boundaries @xcite . finally , @xmath19 is the background dielectric constant and @xmath20 is the distance between particles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of the surrounding plasma on the dust is condensed in the static screening parameter @xmath23 which will be treated as a parameter below .",
    "a second important effect of the medium on the dust particles can be described by a friction force .",
    "it is beyond the hamiltonian model but can be included in the equations of motion , see sec .",
    "[ ss : simulations ] . in writing the formula ( [ equation1 ] ) we assumed that all particles have identical mass and charge which is a good approximation of the experimental conditions .",
    "in fact , commercially available dust particles have a diameter which fluctuates by less than one percent , and the remaining charge variations were shown to have a negligable effect on the structure of yukawa balls @xcite .",
    "thus , the present model is expected to be well appropriate to reproduce the experimental conditions .    in eq .",
    "( [ equation1 ] ) we have also included a possibly time - dependent potential @xmath24 which describes external manipulations of the dust particles .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ equation1 ] ) is brought to a simpler dimensionless form suitable for numerical analysis by introducing units of length and energy , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 corresponds to the ground state distance of two particles in the trap in the absence of screening and @xmath28 is the corresponding pair interaction energy . as the third scale parameter",
    "we introduce the unit of time @xmath29 which is the inverse of the trap frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the model ( [ equation1 ] ) is well suited for accurate computer simulations .",
    "since the dust particles consitute a classical system , exact simulation methods are available which include molecular dynamics ( md ) , langevin dynamics ( lmd ) and metropolis monte carlo ( mc ) which have been successfully applied in recent years .",

    "note that in contrast to thermodynamics of macroscopic systems , here the volume is not fixed but its role is taken over by the confinement strength .",
    "the exponent @xmath42 of the probability distribution @xmath43 is the hamiltonian ( [ equation1 ] ) with the momenta put equal to zero [ the momentum and coordinate distributions factorize , and the former is given by a maxwellian and does not influence the particle configurations ] . also , the effect of dissipation is not included in this description .",

    "let us start the analysis of yukawa balls by considering their ground state properties .",
    "they are obtained in the zero - temperature limit where all particles settle in the minima of the total potential energy @xmath42 given by the sum of confinement and pair interactions . while zero temperature seems to contradict the experimental situation ",
    "the experiments are performed at room temperature  this is in fact a very good approximation .",
    "the reason is the very high charge collected on the grain surface leading to a potential energy per particle which exceeds the kinetic energy by a factor of @xmath44 or more .",
    "therefore , kinetic energy has a negligible effect on the stationary properties . in most cases the potential energy has several minima . in this case ,",
    "the deepest minimum corresponds to the classical ground state whereas the others correspond to metastable states . due to the spherical symmetry of the hamiltonian @xmath42 the low temperature stationary states have the same symmetry : they consist of spherically symmetric concentric shells with a very small width which is in excellent agreement with the experiment .",
    "different states differ by the radii and populations @xmath45 of the shells .",
    "the particle arrangement within the shells is highly symmetric with a combination of five - fold and six - fold symmetry ( particles dominantly have five or six nearest neighbors ) @xcite .",

    "this is efficiently done by md simulations by solving eqs .",

    "is the breathing mode ( uniform radial expansion and contraction ) .",
    "recently it could be shown @xcite that yukawa balls do not possess such a mode .",
    "instead they can exhibit simultaneously several monopole oscillations ( periodic increase and reduction of the mean radius ) .",
    "also , first experimental observations of the normal modes of small yukawa balls have been performed @xcite .",
    "the confinement potential in the experiments is certainly never perfectly isotropic , so the analysis of anisotropy effects is of interest .",
    "ground and metastable states in anisotropic parabolic confinements have been analyzed as a function of the anisotropy by apolinario et al .",
    "they also analyzed the normal modes of these systems .",
    "the results are of interest also for experiments where the confinement is made anisotropic on purpose .",
    "another interesting theoretical investigation has been performed by psakhie et al .",
    "they performed md simulations for yukawa balls containing two sorts of particles having different masses @xcite . in their model the confinement forces , the termophoretic force , gravity , electric field force and ion drag have been explicitely included .",
    "increasing the mass difference they found that beyond a critical mass asymmetry the yukawa ball may split in two balls containing different particles which are vertically separated .",
    "recently , first simulations of the short - time dynamics of yukawa balls have been performed by khlert et al .",
    "starting from a random initial state and rapidly turning on the confinement showed a very interesting nonequilibrium behavior with a non - monotonic kinetic energy increase .",
    "this behavior is very different from the ultrafast dynamics of weakly coupled plasmas and is a very interesting subject of further research .",
    "in this review , and overview on the recently discovered spherical crystals in dusty plasmas  yukawa balls  has been given .",
    "the experimental setup and the diagnostic methods have been briefly discussed .",
    "the main attention was then devoted to the theoretical modeling and to computer simulatinos of yukawa balls , when possible , aiming at a detailed comparison to the experimental data .",
    "this close connection between experiment and theory has lead to substantial advances in our understanding of finite yukawa crystals .",
    "it was shown that the yukawa balls produced in the kiel and greifswald labs are well described by an isotropic statically screened pair potential and that wake effects are apparantly not of importance .",
    "this situation may change when larger balls are studied which is an interesting question for further research .",
    "it was shown that screening has a crucial effect on the internal structure of yukawa balls , including the shell populations , the ground and metastable states .",
    "comparisons between measurement and simulations allowed to accurately determine the value of the screening parameter .",
    "besides the shell structure , also the mean distribution of charge throughout the yukawa balls could be explained .",
    "this was achieved by an analytical theory based on a fluid - like description .",
    "it could be shown that , with increased screening , the average density is more and more concentrated in the central region of the cluster and rapidly decays towards the edge .",
    "this is an important difference to coulomb systems , including spherical ion crystals , which exhibit a constant radial density profile .",
    "not only the ground state of the yukawa balls could be observed .",
    "the experiments were able to reliably detect metastable states and to reveal the probability of their occurence .",
    "these measurements could be well explained by theory and simulations where it became clear that the ( in some cases ) dominant role of metastable states  despite relatively low temperature  is due to the large friction experienced by the dust particles in the plasma . besides the static properties also several dynamic aspects are now well understood .",
    "the experiments could demonstrate that spontaneous transitions between various stationary states occur which is well explained by a theoretical analysis of the potential energy landscape , in particular from the energy barriers between local potential minima .",
    "the theory further predicted a rather interesting melting behavior of the yukawa balls upon further temperature increase .",
    "it will be of high interest to verify these predictions in future experiments .    at the same time",
    "many fundamental theoretical questions remain to be answered . in the shell strucutre of the yukawa balls correlation effects play a crucial role .",
    "this became clear by studying greatly simplified shell models .",
    "these effect were also important to explain the density profile of yukawa balls at large screening using a local density approximation . yet no analytical results for the pair correlations are known and no derivation of these effects from statistical mechanics has been given .",
    "the excellent experimental accuracy gives a unique opportunity to advance and verify modern theoretical approaches in strongly coupled plasmas .",
    "finally , questions of further interest in the field of yukawa balls include their normal mode spectrum , and their interaction with external electric and magnetic fields",
    ". this will require to take into account the modification of the pair interaction",
    ". here also wake effects could play a more important role .",
    "last but not least it is becoming possible to advance to an analysis of the short - time behavior yukawa balls . excerting a fast excitation ,",
    "e.g. by laser manipulation , the time - dependent response of these strongly correlated systems can be systematically studied .",
