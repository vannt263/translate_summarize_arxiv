    "our current understanding of cosmology and high energy physics leaves many questions unanswered .",
    "one of the most fundamental of these questions is why our universe has three large dimensions .",
    "this may be tied to the more general question of the overall shape and structure of the universe .",
    "in fact , it is possible that our universe was not always three dimensional or that other places outside of our observable universe have a different dimensionality .",
    "there are surely long - lived vacua where one or more of our three dimensions are compactified , since this does not even rely on the presence of extra - dimensions and indeed happens in the standard model @xcite .",
    "eternal inflation can provide a means to populate these vacua , and naturally leads to a highly inhomogeneous universe on very long length scales .",
    "further , it seems likely that these lower - dimensional vacua are at least as numerous as three dimensional ones since there are generally more ways to compactify a greater number of spatial dimensions .",
    "if we do indeed have a huge landscape of vacua ( e.g.  @xcite ) then it seems all the more reasonable that there should be vacua of all different dimensionalities and transitions between them ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we will ignore the subtle issues of the likelihood of populating those vacua ( the  measure problem \" ) .",
    "instead we will focus on the possibility of observing such regions of lower dimensionality since surely such a discovery would have a tremendous effect on our understanding of cosmology and fundamental physics .",
    "our compact dimensions are generically unstable to decompactification @xcite .",
    "thus it seems possible that the universe began with all the dimensions compact ( the starting point in @xcite for example ) . in this picture",
    "our current universe is one step in the chain towards decompactifying all dimensions .",
    "of course , eternal inflation may lead to a very complicated history of populating different vacua , but in any case , it seems reasonable to consider the possibility that we came from a lower dimensional  ancestor \" vacuum .",
    "we will assume that prior to our last period of slow - roll inflation our patch of the universe was born in a transition from a lower dimensional vacuum .",
    "our universe then underwent the normal period of slow - roll inflation . for our signals to be observable we will assume that there were not too many more than the minimal number of efolds of inflation necessary to explain the cmb sky . this may be reasonable because this is very near a catastrophic boundary : large scale structures such as galaxies would not form if inflation did not last long enough to dilute curvature sufficiently @xcite .",
    "since achieving slow - roll inflation is difficult and the longer it lasts the more tuned the potential often is , there may be a pressure to be close to this lower bound on the length of inflation .",
    "we will actually use the energy density in curvature , @xmath0 , in place of the number of efolds of inflation .",
    "the observational bound requires that @xmath1 today ( this corresponds to @xmath2 efolds for high scale inflation ) .",
    "the existence of galaxies requires @xmath3 today ( corresponding to @xmath4 efolds if we use the bound from @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath0 may be close to the observational bound today .",
    "other , similar arguments have also been made for a relatively large curvature today @xcite .",
    "most signals of the presence of other vacua , e.g.  bubble collisions @xcite , also rely on this assumption .",
    "these signals have also mostly been explored assuming that the other vacua are all 3 + 1 dimensional . while an important first step , this seems like a serious oversimplification .",
    "we find interesting differences in the case that our parent vacuum was lower dimensional .",
    "in particular , our universe can be anisotropic , with different spatial curvatures in the different directions .",
    "this anisotropic curvature dilutes exponentially during inflation , making the universe appear very isotropic at early times .",
    "however , this curvature ( @xmath0 ) grows at late times , leading to several observable effects .",
    "this anisotropic curvature sources an anisotropy in the hubble expansion rate , since the different dimensions expand at different rates .",
    "the most interesting signal is an anisotropy in the normal cmb curvature measurement .",
    "the angular size of a ",
    "standard ruler \" now appears to depend on the orientation of that ruler .",
    "in the cmb this shows up as unexpected correlations between modes of all angular sizes . unlike the normal curvature measurement",
    ", this anisotropic curvature measurement is not degenerate with the scale factor expansion history and is thus easier to measure .",
    "this anistropic curvature also leads to a significant quadrupolar anisotropy in the cmb which constrains the size of @xmath0 .",
    "there are possibly other observables from 21 cm measurements , direct measurements of the hubble expansion ( e.g.  from supernovae ) , or from searches looking for nontrivial topology of the universe .",
    "in this section we will compute the evolution of a universe that began with one or two of our three spatial dimensions compactified .",
    "we will consider the possibility that our universe began in a lower - dimensional vacuum .",
    "in particular we assume that just prior to our recent period of slow - roll inflation , the currently observable part of the universe ( our  pocket universe \" in landscape terminology ) was in a vacuum with only one or two large , uncompactified spatial dimensions .",
    "the other dimensions , including the one or two that will eventually become part of our three large spatial dimensions , are compactified and stable .",
    "the universe then tunnels , nucleating a bubble of our vacuum in which three spatial dimensions are uncompactified and thus free to grow with the cosmological expansion .",
    "we will consider starting from either a 1 + 1 or 2 + 1 dimensional vacuum .",
    "we will not consider the 0 + 1 dimensional case in great detail , as it is significantly different @xcite .",
    "however it is possible that it will have the same type of signatures as we discuss for the other two cases , depending on the details of the compactification manifold .",
    "consider first the case that the universe is initially 2 + 1 dimensional , and in the tunneling event one of the previously compactified spatial dimensions becomes decompactified , losing whatever forces were constraining it and becoming free to grow ( in the tunneling event it may also grow directly ) .",
    "we can think of this as a radion for that dimension which is initially trapped in a local minimum , tunneling to a section of its potential where it is free to roll .",
    "of course , the tunneling event may actually be due to a change in the fluxes wrapping the compact dimension , or in general to a change in whatever is stabilizing that dimension .",
    "the exact nature of this tunneling will not concern us since the further evolution of the universe is relatively insensitive to this . in all cases",
    "a bubble of the new vacuum is formed in the original 2 + 1 dimensional space . the bubble wall ( which is topologically an @xmath5 not an @xmath6 ) expands outward .",
    "the interior of this coleman - de luccia bubble @xcite is an infinite , open universe with negative spatial curvature ( see e.g.  @xcite for this bubble in arbitrary dimensionality space - times ) .",
    "but this negative spatial curvature is only in two dimensions .",
    "the third , previously small , dimension may be topologically an @xmath5 or an interval , but in any case will not have spatial curvature .",
    "thus the metric after the tunneling inside the bubble is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coordinate of the previously compactified dimension and @xmath9 for negative spatial curvature in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "this is known as a bianchi iii spactime .",
    "if instead the universe is initially 1 + 1 dimensional and two spatial dimensions decompactify in the transition then the situation will be reversed . the single originally large dimension ( now labelled with coordinate @xmath8 ) will be flat but the other two dimensions may have curvature ( either positive or negative ) .",
    "for example , if they were compactified into an @xmath6 they would have positive curvature and so would be described by eqn .   with @xmath11 , known as a kantowski - sachs spacetime . or if those two dimensions were a compact hyperbolic manifold , for example , they would be negatively curved with @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , generically compactifications do have curvature in the extra dimensions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "of course it is also possible that the two compact dimensions had zero spatial curvature",
    ". we will not consider this special case in great detail since it does not lead to most of our observable signals .",
    "we will thus assume that our universe begins with anisotropic spatial curvature , with metric as in eqn .  .",
    "immediately after the tunneling event the universe is curvature dominated , though in this case of course the curvature is only in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "we assume the universe then goes through the usual period of slow - roll inflation , with a low number of efolds @xmath12 near the curvature bound .",
    "the equations of motion ( the  frw equations \" ) are : @xmath13 where the dot @xmath14 denotes @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the energy density , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pressures in the @xmath19 and @xmath8 direction , i.e.  the @xmath20 and @xmath21 components of the stress tensor @xmath22 .",
    "these can be rewritten in terms of the two hubble parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25    at least in the case of tunneling from 2 + 1 to 3 + 1 dimensions , immediately after the tunneling event the universe is curvature dominated .",
    "in this case eqn .   can be solved for @xmath26 directly .",
    "since this is just the usual isotropic frw equation , the solution is as usual @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the bubble wall .",
    "actually , since we will assume the universe transitions to a period of slow - roll inflation after curvature dominance , we will assume there is a subdominant vacuum energy during the period of curvature dominance .",
    "this then gives a perturbutive solution accurate up to linear order in the vacuum energy @xmath29 of @xmath30 .",
    "then we can solve eqn .",
    "perturbatively for @xmath31 .",
    "there are several possible solutions but these are reduced because we will assume that immediately after the tunneling event @xmath32 .",
    "if we imagine the transition as a radion field tunneling through a potential barrier then we know that the radion generically starts from rest after the tunneling . with this boundary condition",
    "the solution to linear order in the vacuum energy is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the initial value of @xmath35 .",
    "since the period of curvature dominance ends when @xmath36 , we see that roughly @xmath26 expands linearly while @xmath35 remains fixed during this period .",
    "thus the different expansion rates @xmath37 and @xmath38 remain very different during this period .",
    "@xmath37 is large while @xmath39 .",
    "the flat dimension will not begin growing rapidly until inflation begins . at that point",
    "though , it will be driven rapidly towards the same expansion rate as the other dimensions , @xmath40 , as we will now show .",
    "since our observed universe is approximately isotropic , we will only need to solve these equations in the limit of small @xmath41 .",
    "we will always work to linear order in @xmath42 .",
    ".   - eqn .",
    "gives @xmath43 note that we have taken the pressure to be isotropic , @xmath44 , which is approximately true in all cases of interest to us .",
    "this is clearly true during inflation . during radiation dominance ( rd )",
    "the radiation is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "since the reactions keeping it in equilibrium have rates much higher than the hubble scales during this time , the pressure is kept locally isotropic . during matter dominance ( md )",
    "the pressure is zero to leading order .",
    "the sub - leading order piece due to the photons will also remain isotropic until after decoupling since the photons remain in equilibrium until this time .",
    "after decoupling the energy density in radiation is quite small compared to the matter density .",
    "further , this small pressure only develops anisotropy due to the differential expansion ( and hence redshifting ) between the @xmath19 and @xmath8 directions .",
    "thus the anisotropy in pressure is proportional to both @xmath42 and the small overall size of the pressure and is therefore negligible for us .",
    "the anisotropic spatial curvature in the metric is the only effect breaking isotropy in this universe and thus the only reason for a differential expansion rate @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , as we will see shortly , the differential expansion @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath0 , the curvature energy density , defined to be @xmath45 since @xmath0 grows during rd and md and it is @xmath46 today , it was quite small during the entire history of the universe after the period of curvature dominance ( to which we will return later ) .",
    "so we will treat both @xmath42 and @xmath0 as our small parameters and work to linear order in each .    if we combine eqns .",
    "and we find an equation for @xmath38 which is true in the limit of small @xmath42 @xmath47 notice that this is exactly the same as the equation for @xmath37 ( eqn .  )",
    "but with the sign of the curvature term flipped .",
    "eqn .   for @xmath37",
    "is just the usual isotropic frw equation .",
    "thus @xmath48 behaves exactly as it would in the normal isotropic universe with a subleading curvature component and @xmath31 behaves as if it was the scale factor in a universe with an equal magnitude but opposite sign of curvature .",
    "can be solved easily because we only need the leading order behavior of @xmath26 and @xmath37 which are just the usual isotropic frw solutions as can be seen easily since eqns .   and are just the usual frw equations . solving eqn .   during the eras of interest and keeping only the inhomogeneous solutions yields @xmath49 as we will show later , the homogeneous solutions all die off as faster functions of time and are thus negligible .",
    "interestingly , this implies that @xmath42 is effectively independent of initial conditions . at every transition",
    "some of the homogeneous solution for @xmath42 is sourced , for example to make up the missing @xmath50 when transitioning from inflation to rd .",
    "but this homogeneous piece dies off faster , leaving only the inhomogeneous piece which is independent of the initial value of @xmath42 .    to find the solutions for the scale factors @xmath48 and @xmath31 up to linear ( subleading ) order in the curvature , we solve eqns .",
    ", , and perturbatively in @xmath0 .",
    "the leading order behavior comes from the dominant energy density ( vacuum energy , radiation , or matter in our three eras ) .",
    "we will only need the solution during md so we can assume @xmath51 then .",
    "contains no @xmath35 s so it can be solved directly for @xmath48 .",
    "once we have the solution for @xmath48 up to linear order in @xmath0 we then plug in to eqn .",
    "to find @xmath31 also to linear order .",
    "the solutions during md to linear order in @xmath0 are @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an arbitrary , physically meaningless constant arising from the coordinate rescaling symmetry .",
    "thus this universe always has a differential expansion rate between the @xmath8 direction and the @xmath19-@xmath54 directions which is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the precise constant of proportionality depends only on the era ( inflation , rd , or md ) and not on initial conditions .",
    "further , the @xmath19-@xmath54 plane expands as in the usual isotropic frw universe , while the @xmath8 direction expands as if it was in that same universe except oppositely curved . during an initial period of curvature dominance",
    "the @xmath8 dimension remains constant while the other two dimensions expand , diluting curvature . during this period the expansion rates @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 are maximally different .",
    "then a period of slow - roll inflation takes over . during this period",
    "the expansion rates are driven exponentially close together .",
    "this difference in expansion rates is largest at the beginning of inflation , immediately after curvature dominance , when @xmath0 is still large . during inflation curvature dilutes exponentially as @xmath55 .",
    "so at the end of inflation the differential expansion rate is completely negligible @xmath56 .",
    "then during rd @xmath0 and hence also @xmath42 remain small , though growing as @xmath57 . during md",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath42 continue to grow @xmath58 , finally reaching their maximal value when the universe transitioned to vacuum energy dominance around redshift @xmath59 .",
    "since this final transition was so recent ( and the homogeneous solution for @xmath42 has not even had much time to die off yet ) we will approximate the universe as matter dominated until today .",
    "in this section , we discuss the late time observables of anisotropic curvature .",
    "we begin by computing its effects on standard rulers .",
    "these effects emerge due to the warping of null geodesics in the anisotropic background metric .",
    "null geodesics along different directions are warped differently by the curvature , leading to differences in the observed angular size of standard rulers in the sky . following this discussion ,",
    "we compute the effect of anisotropic curvature on the cmb .",
    "the cmb is also affected by the warping of the null geodesics that propagate from the surface of last scattering to the current epoch .",
    "this warping affects the relation between the angle at which a cmb photon is observed today and the point at which it was emitted during recombination .",
    "in addition to this effect , the anisotropic metric discussed in section [ sec : metric ] also leads to differential hubble expansion .",
    "this leads to an anisotropic red shift in the universe , which causes a late time observer to see additional temperature anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "we conclude the section with a discussion of additional measurements that could be performed in upcoming experiments .      in this section we present a calculation of the effect on standard rulers .",
    "while this is not a directly observable effect itself since we have no exact standard rulers in the sky , it does provide good intuition for the following calculation of the actual cmb observables in section [ subsec : cmb ] .",
    "further , many of the results of this section are used directly in that calculation .",
    "the spacetimes considered in this paper are curved and anisotropic .",
    "a canonical method to observe curvature is through the measurement of the angular sizes of standard rulers .",
    "curvature modifies the euclidean relationship between the measured angle and the linear size of the ruler . in a universe with anisotropic curvature",
    ", we expect this deviation from euclidean geometry to change with the angular position and orientation of the ruler .    motivated by the use of baryon acoustic oscillations as cosmological standard rulers",
    ", we compute the present day angular size of standard rulers located at the surface of last scattering .",
    "this calculation gives intuition for the effects of anisotropic curvature on the cmb ( studied in detail in section [ subsec : cmb ] ) .",
    "to do so , we first determine the null geodesics that connect the surface of last scattering to a present day observer .",
    "the angle subtended between the two null geodesics that reach the end points of the standard ruler is then the angular size of the ruler . for simplicity , we assume that the universe was matter dominated throughout the period between recombination and the present epoch .",
    "we work with the metric @xmath60 which is produced when a @xmath61 dimensional universe is produced by tunneling from a @xmath62 dimensional vacuum .",
    "we restrict our attention to this scenario in order to facilitate concrete computation .",
    "however , our results can be applied to a wide class of scenarios that lead to anisotropic geometries .",
    "the metric describes a universe where two of the spatial dimensions ( parameterized by the coordinates @xmath63 in ) have negative curvature and grow with scale factor @xmath64 .",
    "the other dimension , parameterized by the coordinate @xmath8 in , grows with scale factor @xmath65 .",
    "the space - time geometry of such a universe can also be described using the metric with @xmath66 .",
    "these metrics are related by a coordinate transformation and they yield identical frw equations , and for the scale factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "th is setup also describes anisotropic universes with positive curvature ( equation with @xmath11 ) .",
    "such a universe is described by the metric with the @xmath67 term replaced by @xmath68 . with this metric , the frw ( equations , and ) and null geodesic equations have the same parametric forms .",
    "our calculations also apply to this case , with the difference between the two cases being captured by the sign of the curvature term @xmath0 .",
    "an observer o ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) at the present time receives photons from the surface of last scattering @xmath69 .",
    "this photon follows a null geodesic . in computing this null geodesic ,",
    "we can assume without loss in generality that the point o lies at the origin of the coordinate system . with this choice , we focus on geodesics that lie along a direction of constant @xmath54 .",
    "these geodesics contain all the information required to describe our setup .",
    "the geodesics that connect the point o with the surface of last scattering have zero velocity along the @xmath54 direction .",
    "the @xmath70 symmetry in the @xmath63 plane then implies that @xmath54 remains constant during the subsequent evolution of the geodesic .",
    "using the metric , the null geodesic equations that describe the photon s trajectory @xmath71 are @xmath72 where the dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath73 . with the boundary condition that the null geodesic reaches o at time @xmath74 ,",
    "equation can be solved perturbatively to leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath75 on @xmath69 from which the photon is emitted are @xmath76 in the above expression , @xmath77 is a parameter that governs the direction in the @xmath78 plane from which the photon is received at o and @xmath79 denotes the fractional energy density in curvature at the present time .",
    "the physical angle @xmath80 between the photon s trajectory and the @xmath8 axis , as measured by a local observer , is different from @xmath77 , and is given by @xmath81 for the geodesics computed in , the relation between the parameter @xmath77 and the physical angle @xmath82 observed at o is @xmath83 the @xmath84 corrections in the definition arise because the coordinates @xmath85 used to describe the metric are not locally flat .",
    "local coordinates @xmath86 can be constructed at any point @xmath87 of the space - time .",
    "these two sets of coordinates are related by @xmath88 the coordinate transformations in imply that operators constructed from global coordinates ( _ e.g. _ @xmath89 ) differ from the corresponding operator in the local inertial frame ( _ e.g. _ @xmath90 ) by quantities @xmath91 .",
    "the difference between these operators is suppressed by the ratio of the size of the local experiment over the hubble radius .",
    "these differences are negligible for any local experiment today .",
    "the angle defined by is therefore very close to the physical angle measured by a local experiment and we will use this definition for subsequent calculations .    with the knowledge of the geodesics , we can calculate the angular size of a standard ruler of length @xmath92 at the time of recombination . since @xmath0 is very small during this time",
    ", the physical size of the ruler is independent of its location and orientation .",
    "first , consider a ruler oriented in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "this ruler lies between the co - ordinates @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the time @xmath95 of recombination .",
    "the length of this ruler is @xmath96 using and in , we find that the angular size @xmath97 subtended by a ruler of length @xmath92 at a local experiment o is @xmath98 a similar procedure can also be adopted to describe standard rulers that lie along the @xmath63 plane",
    ". the angular size of these rulers is given by the angle @xmath54 between the null geodesics that connect the ends of the ruler to the origin .",
    "following the above procedure , this angular size @xmath99 is @xmath100 the angular size of a standard ruler thus changes when its location and orientation are changed ( see figure [ fig : rulers ] ) . for a ruler located at @xmath101 (",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath102 ) the warp of the angle ( in equations and ) changes from @xmath103 for a ruler in the @xmath63 plane to @xmath104 for a ruler oriented in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "similarly , as a ruler oriented in the @xmath8 direction is moved from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , the angular warp factor changes from @xmath104 to @xmath107 .",
    "the reason for this change can be traced to the fact that for a ruler oriented in the @xmath8 direction , all of the angular warp occurs due to the effect of the curvature on the scale factor . @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "expand as though they have the same magnitude of the curvature but with opposite sig n. consequently , the angular warps along the two directions also have the same magnitude , but are of opposite sign .",
    "this angular dependence is an inevitable consequence of the anisotropic curvature @xmath0 endemic to this metric .",
    "we note that this measurement of the anisotropic curvature is relatively immune to degeneracies from the cosmological expansion history since the angular size changes depending upon the orientation of the ruler along every line of sight .",
    "we discuss how this measurement can be realized using cmb measurements in section [ subsec : statisticalanisotropy ] .",
    "the cmb offers a unique probe of the space - time geometry between the surface of last scattering and the current epoch .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the cmb photons at the time of last scattering are well determined .",
    "differences between this well determined spectrum and observations of the local flux of cmb photons arise during the propagation of the photons from recombination to the present epoch .",
    "these differences can be used to trace the space - time geometry since these photons travel along null geodesics of the geometry . in this section ,",
    "we use the trajectories of cmb photons computed in sub section [ subsec : rulers ] to derive the spectrum of the cmb flux observed today .",
    "the cmb flux observed at o ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the number of photons with energies between @xmath110 and @xmath111 received at o within a solid angle @xmath112 in an area @xmath113 during a time @xmath114 .",
    "the angle @xmath82 is defined as per since that definition corresponds to the physical angle that a local observer measures between the photon s trajectory and the @xmath8 axis .",
    "the photons that are received at o within this solid angle were emitted from the point p on the surface of last scattering @xmath69 ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) .",
    "since the geometry of the universe ( equation ) is curved , the solid angle @xmath115 is different from the solid angle at o. the energy @xmath116 at which the photon is emitted is also different from the energy @xmath110 at which it is received owing to the expansion of the universe .",
    "furthermore , due to the differential expansion of the @xmath117 plane and the @xmath8 directi on , this energy shift is also a function of the solid angle .",
    "the photons received in the space - time volume @xmath118 are emitted from a volume @xmath119 .",
    "the ratio of these volume elements is proportional to the expansion of the universe .",
    "incorporating these effects , the flux can be expressed as @xmath120 or , in terms of the emission flux @xmath121 , @xmath122    to find the local flux , we have to relate the geometric and energy elements in at p to those at o. we begin with the angle @xmath82 . using the definition of @xmath80 and the solution for the geodesic , we solve for @xmath82 along the null geodesic and find that @xmath123 where @xmath82 and @xmath124 are the angles of the photon s trajectory at the observer s present location o and the point p ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) on the surface of last scattering which is connected to o by the null geodesic .",
    "we have ignored contributions of order @xmath125 , the fractional energy in curvature at the time of recombination , in this solution .",
    "this is justified since @xmath126 .",
    "the angle @xmath54 is unaffected by the anisotropic curvature since there is an @xmath70 symmetry in the @xmath63 plane .",
    "consequently , @xmath127 .",
    "the volume elements are proportional to the expansion of the universe and are given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the scale factors at the points p and o respectively . finally , we need to compute the relationship between the observed energy @xmath110 of the photon and the emission energy @xmath116 .",
    "the energy e observed by a local observer at some point along the photon s trajectory is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is an affine parameter along the photon trajectory .",
    "using the geodesic equations and the above expression , the present day energy @xmath110 is @xmath133 incidentally , this expression can also be arrived at by red shifting the momentum components of the photon along the radial and @xmath8 directions by @xmath134 respectively .",
    "we now have all the ingredients necessary to compute the present day flux @xmath135 given an initial flux @xmath121 at recombination .",
    "since @xmath0 prior to recombination is much smaller than @xmath136 , the cmb spectrum at recombination is identical to that of the usual frw universe .",
    "in particular , the cmb at p is a black - body at a temperature @xmath137 , with its spectrum , independent of angle , given by the planck distribution @xmath138    we define @xmath139 .",
    "this definition is motivated by the fact that cmb temperature should redshift roughly as the ratio of the scale factors of expansion . in this anisotropic universe , where two dimensions expand with scale factor @xmath26 and the other with scale factor @xmath35 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath140 is roughly the mean expansion factor .",
    "using , , and in , we get @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the spherical harmonic with @xmath143 .",
    "it is well known that primordial density fluctuations lead to temperature anisotropies @xmath144 in the cmb .",

    "the temperature @xmath152 is nearly uniform across the sky with an average temperature @xmath153 and primordial temperature fluctuations @xmath144 . substituting for @xmath152 in , we find that the anisotropic curvature leads to a quadrupole @xmath154 ( see equation ) in the cmb temperature .",
    "the source of this quadrupole is the differential expansion rate of the universe between the @xmath117 plane and the @xmath8 direction ( see equation ) , leading to differential red shifts along these directions .",
    "these differential red shifts lead to a quadrupolar warp of the average temperature of the surface of last scattering .",

    "this cancellation requires a tuning between the primordial quadrupolar density perturbation and the anisotropic curvature contribution .",

    "the primordial density fluctuations are @xmath144 and it is difficult for the quadrupolar fluctuations to be much higher than this level .",
    "however , in a universe with a small number of e - foldings of inflation , the quadrupole is the mode that leaves the horizon at the very beginning of inflation and is therefore sensitive to physics in the primordial pre inflationary space - time .",
    "these phenomena are not constrained by inflationary physics and they could lead to additional power in the quadrupolar modes @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible for the power in the primordial quadrupolar mode to be somewhat larger , leading to possible cancellation of the quadrupole from the late time anisotropic curvature .",

    "the small anisotropies prior to recombination do alter this distribution and can give rise to additional observables @xcite .",
    "however , these corrections are proportional to the anisotropic curvature @xmath168 during recombination @xcite .",

    "it is sufficient to assume that the spectrum of density fluctuations at recombination is statistically isotropic and gaussian .",
    "we will therefore make this assumption for the rest of the paper .",
    "our task is to start with this spectrum at recombination and compute the characteristics of the cmb spectrum observed by o.    the anisotropic curvature warps the cmb spectrum at o in three ways .",
    "first , the photons from the surface of last scattering that reach o do not lie on a spherical surface ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) .",
    "this warped surface @xmath69 is described by equation , where the deviations from sphericity are proportional to the late time curvature @xmath79 .",
    "second , the angle @xmath82 at which the photon is received at o is different from the co - ordinate angle @xmath170 on the surface of recombination at which this photon was originally emitted .",
    "third , the photon is red - shifted when it reaches o. this red - shift also depends upon the angle since the anisotropic curvature causes a differential hubble expansion leading to anisotropic red - shifts .",
    "we first determine the spectrum on @xmath69 , the surface from which photons at recombination reach o. @xmath69 can be described using spherical coordinates @xmath171 .",
    "@xmath172 is the physical distance at recombination between @xmath173 and a point @xmath174 on @xmath69 ( see figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) , @xmath170 is the polar angle between the @xmath8 axis and the unit vector at o that lies in the direction of @xmath174 and @xmath54 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "these flat space coordinates appropriately describe the recombination surface since the spatial curvature was very small during this period . in particular , the polar angle @xmath170 is given by @xmath175 while the physical distance @xmath172 ( using equation ) is @xmath176 the spectrum at @xmath69 can be characterized by @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the temperature at the recombination surface .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath179 in is introduced for convenience .",
    "it accounts for the red shift of the mean temperature from the era of recombination to the present time , but does not introduce additional correlations in the power spectrum . with this definition of @xmath180 , the correlation functions of the distributions and can be directly compared .    after determining the correlators @xmath180",
    ", we will incorporate the effects of the angular and energy warps to the spectrum .",

    "the relationship between @xmath170 and @xmath82 can be obtained from their respective definitions and .",
    "this relationship is given by @xmath199 owing to the @xmath200 symmetry in the @xmath63 plane , the angle @xmath54 is the same as the azimuthal angle @xmath201 used by o. we use the above relation to expand @xmath149 to leading order in @xmath79 , obtaining @xmath202 the second term in the above expression arises as a result of the differential red shift caused by the non - isotropic hubble expansion , while the third time arises due to the warp between the angles @xmath82 and @xmath170 ( as in equation ) .",
    "this expansion is valid for angular scales @xmath203 . using the spherical harmonic expansions for @xmath149 and @xmath178 in terms of @xmath167 and @xmath180 respectively , we find    @xmath204    the coefficients @xmath205 in",
    "are obtained by combining the different spherical harmonics in .",
    "these coefficients are computed in the appendix [ appendixspherical ] . using the correlators of the @xmath180 ( see equation )",
    ", we can compute the expectation values @xmath206    other correlation functions are unaffected by the anisotropic curvature @xmath79 .",
    "equation specifies that modes separated by 2 units of angular momentum @xmath198 are mixed while there is no mixing between modes of different @xmath207 .",
    "physically , this implies correlations between modes of different angular scales ( separated by two units of scale ) , but not of different orientation .",
    "the absence of mixing between modes of different orientation is due to the fact that the space - time preserves an @xmath200 symmetry in the @xmath63 plane .",
    "however , even though there is no correlation between modes of different @xmath207 , the power @xmath208 in a mode depends upon @xmath207 through the coefficients @xmath209 and @xmath210 . both these coefficients scale as @xmath211 ( see equations and ) .",
    "hence , we expect different amounts of power in the high @xmath207 mode versus th e low @xmath207 mode for a given @xmath198 .    equipped with the knowledge of the correlators",
    ", we can perform tests of the statistical isotropy of the cmb .",
    "we follow the bipolar power spectrum analysis proposed by @xcite and adopt their notation ( note that the normalization convention adopted by @xcite is different from that used by the wmap team @xcite ) . in this analysis ,",
    "one computes the correlator @xmath212 where the @xmath213 are clebsch gordan coefficients . in a statistically isotropic universe ,",
    "these correlators are all zero except when @xmath214 and @xmath215 . in the present case ,",
    "we use the correlators to compute the above statistic . for large @xmath198 ,",
    "the only non - zero correlators are @xmath216 since the @xmath217 are smooth functions of @xmath198 , @xmath218 .",
    "the above correlators then scale as @xmath219 we note that these correlators are non - zero for all angular scales .",
    "this is precisely because the late time warp caused by the anisotropic curvature affects all the modes in the cmb .",
    "consequently , this is a statistically robust test of anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , this test of anisotropic curvature is immune to degeneracies from the expansion history of the universe that plague the measurement of isotropic curvature .",
    "indeed , in an isotropic universe , irrespective of the cosmological expansion history , this statistic would be zero .",
    "this is similar to the effect discussed in section [ subsec : rulers ] on standard rulers . in both cases ,",
    "the anisotropic curvature affects measurements along every line of sight , breaking degeneracies with the cosmological expansion history .",
    "the similarity between these two effects is not surprising since the statistic captures the effect of the angular warp of the cmb by the anisotropic curvature ( the third term in ) .",
    "minimum variance estimators obtained from the cmb temperature / polarization for a power asymmetry of this type and the observability are calculated in @xcite .",
    "statistical analyses of the sort discussed in this section have been performed with the wmap data @xcite . in a universe with anisotropic curvature",
    ", these statistical tests can lead to quadrupolar dependence of the two point function .",
    "the expected answer for the statistic has power only in the @xmath220 and @xmath221 modes .",
    "furthermore , since these correlators are proportional to @xmath217 , the effect shows a bump around the first acoustic peak .",
    "interestingly , the two point quadrupolar anomaly in the wmap data shows similar characteristics with power only in the @xmath220 and @xmath221 modes , which peaks around the first acoustic peak .",
    "this anomaly could be explained in our scenario if the anisotropic curvature @xmath222 .",
    "however , such a large anisotropic curvature is heavily constrained by the absence of a correspondingly large quadrupole in the cmb ( see section [ subsec : cmbquadrupole ] ) .",
    "while this anomaly may be due to other systematic effects @xcite , similar searches could be performed with upcoming cmb experiments .",
    "it is conceivable that these experiments could discover correlations from anisotropic curvatures @xmath223 , as allowed by the size of the cmb quadrupole .",
    "we have so far considered only signals arising from the geometry of the universe , but observable signals may also arise from the topology .",
    "the normal eternal inflation picture makes it appear that space should be very large or infinite in all directions @xcite .",
    "if our observable universe nucleated as a bubble from ( 3 + 1 dimensional ) false vacuum inflation then it will appear as an infinite , open universe .",
    "however , in our picture it is natural that the observable universe could have one or two compact dimensions , even though it came from an eternally inflating space .",
    "interestingly , the size of these compact dimensions may be close to the hubble scale today because the period of slow - roll inflation was not too long . in the case of a 2 + 1 dimensional parent vacuum ,",
    "the topology of the spatial dimensions of the observable universe would be @xmath224 . since the curvature is all in the @xmath225 and not the @xmath5 ,",
    "the curvature radius of the universe and the topology scale ( in this case the radius of the @xmath5 ) are disconnected .",
    "thus , even though the curvature radius today is restricted to be @xmath226 times longer than the hubble scale , the size of the compact dimension can be smaller than the hubble scale .",
    "in fact , we expect that slow - roll inflation began when the curvature radius was around the hubble scale of inflation .",
    "thus , for the @xmath5 to be around the hubble scale today it would have needed to be about @xmath227 times smaller than the hubble size at the beginning of inflation . for high scale inflation",
    "this is near the gut scale , a very believable initial size for that dimension .",
    "this scenario is interestingly different from the compact topologies often considered , for which an isotropic geometry ( @xmath228 , @xmath229 or @xmath230 ) is usually assumed ( though see @xcite ) .",
    "any compact topology necessarily introduces a global anisotropy , but in our scenario even the local geometry of the universe is anisotropic .",
    "this allows the curvature radius and the topology scale to be different by orders of magnitude .",
    "thus it is reasonable that in our picture we may also have the  circles in the sky \" signal of compact topology @xcite .",
    "current limits from the wmap data require the topology scale to be greater than 24 gpc @xcite .",
    "this limit can be improved by further searching , especially with data from the planck satellite , to close to the @xmath231 gpc diameter of our observable universe .",
    "if discovered in conjunction with anisotropic curvature this would provide a dramatic further piece of evidence that we originated in a lower dimensional vacuum .",
    "further the directions should be correlated .",
    "if the parent vacuum was 2 + 1 dimensional then we expect the circles in the sky to be in the previously compact direction ( the @xmath5 ) while the curvature is in the other two dimensions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the parent vacuum was 1 + 1 dimensional then it seems possible that both the signals of curvature and the compact topology would be in the same two dimensions , with the third dimension appearing flat and infinite .",
    "thus seeing both the anisotropic curvature and signals of the compact topology may provide another handle for determining the dimensionality of our parent vacuum .",
    "the cmb is a precise tool to measure cosmological parameters .",
    "however , it is a two dimensional snapshot of the universe at a given instant in time .",
    "additional information can be obtained through three dimensional probes of the universe .",
    "several experiments that yield three dimensional data are currently being planned .",
    "these include 21 cm tomography experiments and galaxy surveys .",
    "a complete study of the effects of anisotropic curvature in these experiments is beyond the scope of this work . in this section",
    ", we briefly mention some possible tests of this scenario in these upcoming experiments .",
    "a three dimensional map of the universe can be used to distinguish anisotropic curvature from fluctuations in the matter density .",
    "anisotropic curvature does not lead to inhomogeneities in the matter distribution .",
    "consequently , measurements of the large scale matter density can be used to distinguish between these two situations .",
    "such measurements may be possible using upcoming 21 cm experiments and high redshift surveys , for example lsst .",
    "lsst should be sensitive to isotropic curvatures down to @xmath232 with objects identified out to redshift @xmath233 @xcite .",
    "since the dominant effect of anisotropic curvature occurs at late times , lsst should be a good way to probe our signals .",
    "additionally , 21 cm experiments may also be sensitive to isotropic curvatures @xmath223 @xcite , and so may offer a very precise test of anisotropic curvature .",
    "the curvature anisotropy also gives rise to a differential hubble expansion rate @xmath234 ( see section [ sec : metric ] ) , which contributes to the quadrupole in the cmb ( see section [ subsec : cmb ] ) .",
    "this effect will also be visible in direct measurements of the hubble parameter .",
    "current experimental constraints on this effect are at the level of a few percent @xcite and are likely to become better than @xmath161 in future experiments @xcite .",
    "a universe produced as a result of bubble nucleation from an ancestor vacuum which has two large dimensions and one small , compact dimension is endowed with anisotropic curvature @xmath0 .",
    "such an anisotropic universe is also produced in the case when our 3 + 1 dimensional universe emerges from a transition from a 1 + 1 dimensional vacuum . in this case , depending upon the curvature of the compact dimensions , the resulting universe can have either positive or negative curvature along two dimensions , with the other remaining flat .",
    "the geometry of the equal time slices of the daughter universe are such that two of the directions are curved while the other dimension is flat . immediately after the tunneling event ,",
    "the energy density of the universe is dominated by this anisotropic curvature @xmath0 .",
    "this curvature drives the curved directions to expand differently from the flat direction , resulting in differential hubble expansion @xmath42 between them .",
    "the expansion of the universe dilutes @xmath0 until it becomes small enough to allow slow roll inflation . at this time",
    ", the universe undergoes a period of inflation during which the curvature @xmath0 and the differential hubble expansion @xmath42 are exponentially diluted .",
    "however , during the epochs of radiation and matter domination , the curvature red shifts less strongly than either the radiation or the matter density .",
    "consequently , the fractional energy density @xmath0 in curvature grows with time during these epochs .",
    "this late time emergence of an anisotropic curvature @xmath0 also drives a late time differential hubble expansion @xmath42 in the universe .    these late time , anisotropic warps of the space - time geometry",
    "are all proportional to the current fractional energy density in curvature , @xmath79",
    ". they can be observed in the present epoch if inflation does not last much longer than the minimum number of efolds required to achieve a sufficiently flat universe ( @xmath235 efolds for high scale inflation ) .",
    "anisotropic curvature leads to the warping of the angular size of standard rulers .",
    "this warping is a function of both the angle and orientation of the ruler in the sky .",
    "consequently , this effect is immune to degeneracies from the expansion history of the universe since it affects rulers that are along the same line of sight but oriented differently .",
    "the cmb is also warped by the anisotropic curvature .",
    "in addition to the geometric warping , the differential hubble expansion @xmath42 also preferentially red shifts the energies of the cmb photons . this energy shift differentially changes the monopole temperature of the cmb giving rise to a quadrupole in the cmb .",
    "furthermore , since the anisotropic curvature is a late time effect , it affects all the modes that can be seen in the cmb .",
    "consequently , this effect leads to statistical anisotropy on all angular scales .",
    "this effect is different from other signatures of anisotropy considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "previous work has concentrated on the correlations that are produced due to the initial anisotropy in the universe at the beginning of inflation .",
    "since these modes are roughly stretched to the hubble size today , these initial anisotropies only affect the largest modes in the sky and are hence low l effects in the cmb . the late time anisotropy however warps the entire sky and leads to statistically robust correlations on all angular scales .",
    "the anisotropies in the pre - inflationary vacuum can however lead to other interesting signatures , for example in the gravitational wave spectrum @xcite .",
    "these signatures are an independent check of this scenario .",

    "these required violations of rotational invariance during inflation and the anisotropy emerges directly in the primordial density perturbations . in our case ,",
    "the density perturbations are isotropic and the anisotropy observed today is a result of a late time warp of the space - time .",
    "anisotropic curvature is already more stringently constrained than isotropic curvature .",
    "while isotropic curvature is bounded to be @xmath161 , it is difficult for anisotropic curvature to be much larger than @xmath160 without running afoul of current data , in particular , the size of the cmb quadrupole . since the measurement of curvature is ultimately limited by cosmic variance @xmath144 , there is a window between @xmath236 that can be probed by upcoming experiments , including planck .",
    "future cosmological measurements like the 21 cm experiments will significantly improve bounds on the curvature of the universe .",
    "a discovery of isotropic curvature would be evidence suggesting that our ancestor vacuum had at least three large space dimensions .",
    "on the other hand , a discovery of anisotropic curvature would be strong evidence for the lower dimensionality of our parent vacuum .",
    "the anisotropy produced from such a transition has a very specific form due to the symmetries of the transition .",
    "it leads to correlations only amongst certain modes in the cmb ( for example , only @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) .",
    "this distinguishes it from a generic anisotropic @xmath61 dimensional pre - inflationary vacuum which will generically have power in all modes . in these scenarios",
    ", it is also natural for the universe to have non - trivial topology .",
