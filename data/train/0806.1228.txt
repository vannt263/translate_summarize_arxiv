    "over the course of the past year the behavior of graphene in the presence of a strong external coulomb field was analyzed in considerable detail .",
    "@xcite this problem is important , notably , for our understanding of electronic transport in the presence of charged impurities.@xcite in addition , since the effective coupling constant in graphene , @xmath0 , can be rather large ( in vacuum @xmath1 ) , the exploration of features uniquely associated with the strong - field regime @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 stands for the strength of the external coulomb field : @xmath4 ) becomes a realistic prospect . in this context",
    ", it was found that above a critical value @xmath5 characteristic resonances appear in the energy spectrum @xcite and the vacuum polarization density varies as @xmath6 . in the subcritical regime ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "on the other hand , the polarization charge is concentrated around the coulomb center in such a way that one obtains @xmath8 , within the continuum approximation for the electron dynamics .",
    "the physics around the critical point @xmath9 is a peculiar massless realization of the more  conventional \" vacuum charging behavior in massive quantum electrodynamics ( qed),@xcite which also seems possible in graphene under certain conditions.@xcite    the drive to explore unconventional behavior at strong coupling ( @xmath2 ) has been fueled , so far , by theoretical progress only .",
    "experiments in which k@xmath10 ions are deposited in a controlled way onto graphene show the behavior one expects from the theory of scattering of dirac fermions by a coulomb field,@xcite but only in the undercritical regime , perhaps as expected for such low value of @xmath3 .",
    "it is also clear that under current experimental conditions @xmath11 due to dielectric screening by the substrate , and additional screening is provided by the presence of water layers around the samples.@xcite this conspires to significantly increase the effective dielectric constant with a concomitant decrease of @xmath12 , thus making the subcritical regime @xmath13 the relevant one for present - day experiments , and also accounting for the feeble signatures of interaction effects .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how the characteristic features of the undercritical regime manifest themselves in the vacuum polarization and screening properties . in the strict massless limit",
    "the polarization charge density is concentrated at the potential source , @xmath14 , and non - trivial spatial variation can only occur due to additional interaction effects.@xcite these are expected to be small , and we will see that , perturbatively , they read @xmath15 .    in the present work",
    "we explore another source of density variation caused by the presence of a finite `` mass '' @xmath16 or , equivalently , an energy gap @xmath17 in the electronic spectrum .",
    "there are at least three sources of a gap in graphene .",
    "firstly , it has been realized recently @xcite that epitaxially grown graphene exhibits a substantial gap ( @xmath18 ) due to the breaking of the sublattice symmetry by the substrate .",
    "graphene suspended above a graphite substrate also has a small gap @xmath19.@xcite secondly , spin - orbit coupling leads to a gap , albeit of much smaller magnitude : @xmath20.@xcite finally , real mesoscopic samples can have an effective gap generated by their finite size , which scales as @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the polarization density of massive dirac fermions displays characteristic behavior , controlled by the effective `` compton '' wavelength @xmath22 .",
    "our main results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] : for distances @xmath23 , the density variation is logarithmic , crossing over to a power law tail at @xmath24",
    ". it should be possible to explore this behavior with modern experimental techniques for detection of local density variation.@xcite    our starting point is a 2d system of massive dirac electrons in the presence of a coulomb impurity with effective charge @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fermi velocity and @xmath28 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the induced vacuum polarization charge is calculated in linear response according to @xmath29 where @xmath0 and @xmath30 is the static polarization function .",

    "the chemical potential , @xmath36 , is assumed to be in the gap , @xmath37 ( further discussion appears later ) .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we first compute the polarization operator for massive graphene ( section ii ) , which we use in section iii for the calculation of the induced vacuum polarization charge in a weak coulomb field . in section",
    "iv we compare the obtained behavior with results based on exact diagonalization studies on a finite - size lattice .",
    "section v discusses the influence of weak electron - election interactions on the polarization charge , and section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "the polarization function is computed in the standard way as @xmath38 where the trace is over the pauli matrices and @xmath39 accounts for the valley and spin degeneracies .",
    "the green s function at finite mass is given by @xmath40 using a more symmetric 3-vector notation , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc .",

    "leads to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the covariant ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "this procedure therefore requires  regularization \" , i.e. subtraction of the infinite contribution .",
    "the regularization procedure , however , yields the correct result because in a non - relativistic situation , when the energy ( @xmath47 ) integration is performed first in the interval @xmath48 , the resulting momentum integration is ultraviolet convergent ( and cut - off independent ) .    restoring the original notation ,",

    "this follows from the fact that , per eq .",
    ", @xmath82 , meaning that the total polarization charge @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the vacuum charge accumulated within radius @xmath85 : @xmath86 in fact , the rapid decay of @xmath76 beyond @xmath78 means that most of the additional ( positive ) charge , compensating eq .",
    ", is accumulated between the lattice scale ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath78 , in such a way that @xmath88 .",
    "this has peculiar consequences for screening : the impurity potential is best screened at the shortest distances ( @xmath87 ) , screening weakens between @xmath89 , and is essentially absent beyond @xmath78 .",

    "to confirm the applicability of the above results to the real problem on a lattice , and to dismiss possible regularization issues , we have investigated via exact diagonalization the corresponding tight - binding model for graphene , where the lattice appears naturally .",
    "the induced charge density can be straightforwardly obtained with the aid of the exact wave - functions : @xmath96 summation over the two spin components is also assumed ( leading to an additional factor of 2 ) . here @xmath97 are the wave - functions without external field ( @xmath98 ) . rather than address the induced charge itself",
    ", it is more convenient to consider @xmath84 , as defined in eq .  .",
    "this quantity is already averaged over all directions and is thus smoother and more appropriate for a direct numerical comparison .",
    "we have studied two cases : ( a ) tight - binding model on a finite lattice with @xmath99 sites , without explicit mass term , and ( b ) the same system with an explicit mass of @xmath92 , where @xmath100 is the hopping parameter .",
    "these two cases allow us to address the two asymptotic regimes in eqs .   and .",
    "in case ( a ) , although @xmath16 is explicitly zero , there is an effective gap due to the finite size of the system , @xmath101 , and an effective @xmath102.@xcite therefore , there is an appreciable region satisfying @xmath103 .",

    "the smallness of @xmath78 in this case means that the intermediate , logarithmic , regime is inaccessible .",
    "the analytical behavior thus stands in the lattice problem , with qualitative and quantitative agreement , even for the case when the gap is due to the finite lattice size .",
    "electron - election interactions can influence the behavior described above . although questionable on account of the strict zero carrier density , one can perform re - summation of polarization loops within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . for weak interactions rpa",
    "is expected to work quantitatively well , with deviations increasing as the interaction @xmath12 increases.@xcite rpa amounts to the substitution @xmath111    $ ] in eq .  .",

    "[ fig2 ] for different values of the interaction , being clear that the result is a small decrease in the coefficient of the @xmath112 in eq .  .",
    "in addition , a qualitatively important effect arises from self - energy corrections to the polarization .",
    "we evaluate the self - energy at hartree - fock level , which was first done for the massless case in ref .  .",
    "in the massive case we obtain a velocity renormalization of @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the ultraviolet cut - off , and the above expression is valid for @xmath115 .",
    "the mass is also renormalized to a larger value @xmath116 : @xmath117 it is interesting to note that the logarithmic mass renormalization formula in graphene is similar to the well - known expression for the electromagnetic mass ( accounting for radiative corrections ) in 3d relativistic qed.@xcite    from , for @xmath118 , one has @xmath119 $ ] , which leads to the  running \" of the coupling constant : @xmath120 . consequently , expanding @xmath121 in powers of @xmath12 leads , perturbatively , to an additional piece in the polarization charge : @xmath122 this is the perturbative limit of the effect , first discussed in ref .  .",
    "we conclude that electron - electron interactions affect somewhat the above discussed behavior at the scale @xmath78 , but do not change the picture qualitatively .",
    "this can be credited to the mentioned absence of screening , and the fact that interactions do not generate an additional length - scale .",
    "furthermore , it seems that in current experiments @xmath123 , making the interaction corrections parametrically small .",
    "we have found that in the presence of a finite mass gap the polarization charge , induced by a coulomb impurity in graphene , has a non - trivial behavior as a function of distance .",
    "while at zero mass it is concentrated at the impurity site , at finite mass it is distributed mostly up to @xmath124 , with an additional power law tail beyond that .",
    "unlike the massless case , the total vacuum charge is zero since the finite mass _ `` pulls '' _ a compensating charge from infinity to a distance @xmath125 , and the impurity charge remains unscreened beyond this scale .",
    "in relativistic qed @xcite the polarization charge at short distances has anti - screening sign ( enhances the potential ) , while the compensating charge is distributed up to the compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "this behavior arises from the running of the charge @xmath126 in qed . in non - relativistic graphene ( where the charge is not renormalized ) , the situation is reversed as shown by the sign of eqs .   and , .    in the experiment of ref .  ,",
    "where the spectral gap is @xmath127 , we have @xmath128 and the behavior we predict in this work should be observable if an external ion is present and generates the discussed charge re - distribution . in practical terms , in order to detect the density variation the chemical potential might have to be at or above the value of the gap , @xmath129 .",
    "our results will then be strictly valid only for @xmath130 , where the screening length ( determined by the occupation of the conduction band ) remains large and well separated from the scale @xmath78 .",
    "although we strictly have a hyperbolic band , when @xmath131 we can resort to the behavior of a parabolic band in 2d .",
    "screening in this case is somewhat peculiar @xcite due to the finite density of states at the band edge , @xmath132 .",
    "we expect that this could in fact facilitate detection of density variations via stm @xcite compared to the massless case in graphene ."
