    "the astronomical observations indicate that the expansion of our universe accelerates@xcite .",
    "this accelerated expansion is ascribed to a mysterious component with the negative pressure called dark energy that comprises about @xmath6 of the energy density of the universe .",
    "the simplest model for the dark energy is a cosmological constant .",
    "there are many more complex models proposed attempting to explain dark energy either as a dynamic substance(for example quintessence@xcite , phantom@xcite ) or via some forms of modified gravitational theory perhaps related to extra dimensions and string physics@xcite . now",
    "the unified models for dark energy and dark matter have been also discussed@xcite and characteristics of some kinds of models are summarized in alam s works@xcite .",
    "the research team of a. g. riess et al.@xcite have pinpointed the transition epoch from matter domination to dark energy domination when cosmic expansion began to accelerate and also indicated the transition between the two epochs is constrained to be at @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore pressing that an independent model of dark energy can be employed to elaborate the present phenomena and trace back to the past and even forecast the future evolution . to attain this aim ,",
    "in this paper we present the simplest linear equation of state @xmath8 , with @xmath1 , @xmath9 , where the pressure of dark matter @xmath3 has been taken into account .",
    "this model can predict a smooth transition from nonrelativistic matter(including both baryons and dark matter ) domination phase to dark energy domination one in a natural way .",
    "directed by this objective , the paper is organized as follows . the central part of the paper is sec .",
    "2 in which the two constraints in choosing the function @xmath5 are discussed and a suitable function @xmath10 is proposed . from the function some parameters of the universe are derived . in sec .",
    "3 the conclusion is put up that only by choosing a suitable function @xmath5 can the unified equation of state proposed describe the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is known that our universe begins with the big bang .",
    "the radiation should have been the dominant contribution to the total density of the universe when the redshift @xmath11 was more than @xmath12 in the early universe .",
    "the density of radiation decreased and quickly approached @xmath13 with the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , the density of nonrelativistic matter(including both baryons and dark matter ) increased and became the dominant contribution to the universe .",
    "subsequently , the density of nonrelativistic matter decreased and that of dark energy increased and at the same time cosmic expansion transited from deceleration to acceleration , the process of which is discussed in this paper .",
    "we assume dark matter and dark energy satisfy the unified equation of state @xmath14 with @xmath15 , @xmath2 , where the pressure of dark matter and that of dark energy satisfy respectively : @xmath16 , @xmath17(@xmath18 ) .",
    "because of the above equations and the evolution of our universe , there are some constraints for function @xmath5 proposed :    function @xmath5 should maintain negative value forever and vary in the range ( @xmath19 , @xmath13 ) .    for @xmath20 , function @xmath5 should have been approaching @xmath13 but not equaling to @xmath13 for a long time in the high redshift and be smaller and smaller as redshift becomes low .    in terms of the two constraints proposed above , we give a concrete form of function @xmath5 as @xmath21 and we can obtain the solutions of some parameters including fractional components , deceleration - acceleration transition , the equation of state of dark energy , which are coincident with the evolution of the universe and consistent with the present astrophysical observations .    for a spatially flat frw universe , friedmann equation can be written as : @xmath22 also the continuity equation : @xmath23 has to be taken into account , where @xmath24 is the total energy density of our universe @xmath25 , where subscript @xmath26 denotes baryons .",
    "so @xmath27 is the density of baryons and eq .",
    "( [ equ2 ] ) is separated into two parts : @xmath28 @xmath29 if the function @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the positive real constants , substituting @xmath8 to eq .",
    "( [ equ4 ] ) then @xmath33",
    "so the density of dark matter and dark energy evolves with the redshift as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integral constant . using the constraint condition of @xmath36",
    "makes it satisfy : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the present density of dark matter and dark energy and today s evaluated quantities will hereafter denoted by the label @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is how the present critical energy density is defined . replacing eq .",
    "( equ8 ) in eq .",
    "( [ equ7 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath41 the density of baryons and that of dark matter are respectively recognized as : @xmath42 @xmath43 so the total density takes the form : @xmath44 and the density of dark energy can be obtained by eqs .",
    "( [ equ10 ] ) , ( [ equ11 ] ) and ( [ equ12 ] ) as : @xmath45 one can express the fractional energy densities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 as @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 .    assuming @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the fractional energy densities are only the functions of redshift with the prior of @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the assumption is still used in the following calculation .",
    "the results of the three fractional energy densities at the present time are compatible with observations using the priors of @xmath58 , @xmath59 . meanwhile , according to fig .",
    "1a we know that the past evolution of baryons , dark matter and dark energy is consistent with what is recognized .",
    "the cosmology will end up with a big rip in that the universe will be filled with dark energy in future .",
    "the conclusion is shared in many literatures(e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "it follows that the equation of state parameter of dark energy can be obtained as : @xmath60 using eq .",
    "( [ equ17 ] ) we can plot @xmath61 as the function of redshift(see fig .",
    "the equation of state of dark energy is @xmath62 at present .",
    "tracing back to the past , the larger the redshift is , the more the density of nonrelativistic matter(including both baryons and dark matter ) is and the more adjacent to @xmath13 the equation of state of dark energy @xmath61 is , i.e. , we realize an evolving dark energy with the equation of state being below @xmath63 around the present epoch evolved from @xmath64 in the past@xcite .",
    "this is another consistency between our theory and the evolution .",
    "the dominance of the dark energy leads to the acceleration expansion of our universe .",
    "the increasing density of dark energy is the reason why expansion of our universe transited from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "our theory describes the transition .",
    "the deduction is as follows : @xmath65where @xmath66 is the deceleration parameter . using eqs .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) , ( [ equ6 ] ) and ( [ equ9 ] ) , the friedmann equation may be rewritten as @xmath67differentiating eq .",
    "( [ equ19 ] ) with respect to time and changing variable from the cosmic time to the redshift , we finally obtain : @xmath68combining the above two equations , we find that @xmath66 satisfies @xmath69from this expression , we get the present deceleration parameter @xmath70 according to @xmath36 and the transition redshift @xmath71 according to @xmath72 .",
    "the deceleration parameter as the function of redshift is shown in fig.2 .    from above deduction , we know the acceleration of our cosmic expansion will be faster and faster when @xmath4 is chosen . as a result of smaller and smaller @xmath5 , @xmath66 and @xmath19 will also be smaller and smaller and even will approach negative infinity from fig .",
    "3 . it is inevitable that the universe will end up with a big rip . on the condition that choosing another function based on the above two constraints and using another symbol : @xmath73 and ( @xmath74 ) in order to distinguish the two functions , we can still obtain the solutions coincident with the past and the present observational data because of the semblable curves of the two functions in @xmath20 .",
    "but the fate of the universe will be different .",
    "new function @xmath75 is axial symmetry .",
    "smaller @xmath11 will lead to larger @xmath75 in future which also reflects the tendency of the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "both of the densities of baryons , dark matter will approach small quantities , so we think that the total energy density approximately equal to the density of dark energy . because of @xmath76one obtains @xmath77when @xmath78 , @xmath79 , the expansion of the universe will come back to deceleration from acceleration .",
    "we do nt discuss the detailed deduction owing to the difficulty of the integral of gaussian function .",
    "as shown in the above discussion , the results can be obtained which are in agreement with the observational data of the past time and the present time as long as we choose the function @xmath5 in terms of the above two analyzed constraints . at the same time the tendency of b in the range @xmath80 determines the fate of the universe .",
    "so it is possible to find a suitable function to describe the evolution of the universe from the early time to the future .",
    "in summary , this paper considers that the utilization of a unified linear equation of state can describe the history of the universe and its evolution of the future .",
    "it is worth highlighting that we do nt simulate function @xmath5 without foundation but based on some remarkable constraints . analyzing the constraints of the choice of the function @xmath5 in terms of the evolution of our universe and choosing the appropriate function @xmath5 according to the constraints , the evolution of our universe can be obtained in consistence with what is recognized .",
    "both dark matter and dark energy are considered the essential but missing pieces in the cosmic jiasaw puzzle@xcite .",
    "but the nature of either dark matter or dark energy is currently unknown .",
    "we propose this model - independent unified equation of state which can be utilized to forecast the nature of dark matter and dark energy possibly .",
