    "nowadays the family of iron pnictides is a well - established and important prototype system for unconventional high - temperature superconductivity . starting with the first famous compound @xcite in 2008 , today several different sub - families with a wide structural variety",
    "are known .",
    "all different groups of iron pnictides share some common physical properties , such as their interesting and sometimes puzzling magnetic behavior .",
    "most compounds show a phase transition at low temperatures from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic crystal symmetry which is typically accompanied by the formation of long - range antiferromagnetic order.@xcite it is common believe that the suppression of these phase transitions for example by chemical substitution is crucial for the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.@xcite although it is obvious that an understanding of the magnetic fluctuations in the iron pnictides is mandatory to unveil the physics underlying the superconductivity , this task has proven to be more complex than anticipated.@xcite    for example , there was discussion in the literature whether the magnetic moments are better described by an itinerant@xcite or a localized@xcite model and there is up to now no consensus concerning the role of correlation effects@xcite . furthermore , the magnitude of the magnetic moments is difficult to reproduce within density functional theory ( dft ) and it is known to be quite sensitive to computational parameters.@xcite    one of the most important experimental tools to get insight into the electronic structure of the iron pnictides is angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "there are numerous publications on this topic , although it was shown that dft calculations have typically problems to reproduce all features of the arpes spectra correctly.@xcite this is often ascribed to strong correlation effects , although this question is still under discussion.@xcite    another important difficulty which so far is often ignored is the connection between the magnetic phase of the iron pnictides and the resulting consequences for arpes .",
    "this is due to the formation of twinned crystals during the phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic and it results in mixed magnetic domains which are orthogonal to each other .",
    "macroscopic tools like arpes or transport measurements can so only see the averaged information , while information on the anisotropy is lost.@xcite this is a huge drawback considering a comprehensive study of the electronic structure in the iron pnictides , as it is known that the in - plane anisotropy plays a significant role.@xcite in experiment it is possible to effectively detwin the crystals by applying uniaxial stress during the measurement .",
    "this was already done successfully for the 122-prototype in the undoped and in the co - doped case . however , such measurements are connected with several technical difficulties and consequently they are rarely done.@xcite yet , to fully understand the electronic properties of the iron pnictide superconductors in a comprehensive way and to get a deeper insight concerning the influence of the in - plane anisotropy in the magnetic phase such studies are absolutely mandatory .",
    "although there is nowadays experimental data on detwinned crystals showing clearly the anisotropy in the fermi surface there is hardly any theoretical work focusing on this problem of magnetic anisotropy in arpes data .    in this work",
    "this issue is addressed by a comprehensive dft study on the magnetic phase of and on the corresponding arpes spectra .",
    "the computational results can be directly compared to the available experimental arpes data on detwinned crystals.@xcite    in order to deal with this complex situation the korringa - kohn - rostoker - green function ( kkr - gf ) approach is used , which was already shown to be indeed a very useful and accurate tool to deal with the iron pnictides.@xcite the impact of disorder due to substitution is dealt with by means of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , giving results fully compatible to supercell calculations and more reliable than those based on the virtual crystal approximation ( vca).@xcite",
    "all calculations have been performed self - consistently and fully relativistically within the four component dirac formalism , using the munich spr - kkr program package.@xcite    the orthorhombic , antiferromagnetic phase of is investigated in its experimentally observed stripe spin state using a full 4-fe unit cell .",
    "this implies antiferromagnetic chains along the @xmath1- and @xmath2-axes and ferromagnetic chains along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the lattice parameters where chosen according to experimental x - ray data and the experimental as position @xmath4.@xcite to account for the influence of substitution in a linear interpolation for the lattice parameters with respect to the concentration @xmath0 is used based on available experimental data@xcite and vegard s law@xcite .",
    "more details on the procedure can be found in a previous publication.@xcite the treatment of disorder introduced by substitution is dealt with by means of the cpa .",
    "the basis set considered for a @xmath5 including @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals . for the electronic structure calculations the local density approximation ( lda ) exchange - correlation potential with the parameterization given by vosko , wilk and nusair was applied.@xcite    the spectroscopical analysis",
    "is based on the fully relativistic one - step model of photoemission in its spin density matrix formulation . for more technical details on these calculations",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "the geometry of the spectroscopy setup was taken from experiment including a tilt of the sample around either the @xmath1 or @xmath3 axis .",
    "the incident light hit the sample under a constant polar angle @xmath11 and an azimuthal angle @xmath12 of either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "these geometries are referred to as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , meaning the direction of the incident light is either parallel to the antiferromagnetic or the ferromagnetic in - plane directions .",
    "the corresponding electrons were collected with an angle @xmath17 of @xmath18 or @xmath19 and a varying angle @xmath20 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this geometry is in line to the experimental setup .",
    "if not indicated otherwise , an as - terminated surface was chosen .",
    "however , the question of surface termination will be discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "to describe the anisotropy of the iron pnictides in arpes calculations reasonably well one needs first to ensure that the spin - dependent potentials from the self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations are accurate enough .",
    "obviously , the magnetic ordering plays a significant role concerning the anisotropy of the electronic structure and hence the quality of the theoretical description of the arpes spectra is determined by the quality of the spin - dependent potentials .",
    "the most meaningful indication for a proper description of the magnetic state is good agreement with experimental data on the magnetic order . for the iron pnictides this",
    "is known to be a non - trivial task as the magnetic moments are often overestimated by dft.@xcite for the undoped mother compound a total magnetic moment of @xmath23 was obtained .",
    "experiment reports a total magnetic moment of approximately @xmath24 from neutron diffraction@xcite while  mssbauer spectroscopy@xcite and @xmath25sr spectroscopy@xcite coherently give a value of around @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the calculated total magnetic moment is found in good agreement with experiment and captures the proper order of magnitude accurately.@xcite    more importantly , the cpa allows to evaluate the substitution dependent self - consistent evolution of the magnetic moments with increasing co concentration in .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_magnmom ] , where the results for spin and orbital magnetic moments are given in an atom - resolved way .",
    "the total magnetic moment is calculated as substitutionally averaged sum over all contributions .    in agreement with experiment",
    "the total magnetic moments shows a nearly linear decay until the long - range magnetic order disappears.@xcite in the calculations the critical co substitution for the disappearance of antiferromagnetic order occurs for @xmath27 , which is in reasonably good agreement with the experimental value @xmath28.@xcite it should be mentioned that the results in fig .",
    "[ fig_magnmom ] are slightly improved with respect to experiment in comparison with our previous work@xcite due to the higher @xmath29 expansion used here .",
    "however , the trends in the magnetic moments and the resulting conclusions are the same .",
    "as the one - step model of photoemission fully accounts for matrix - elements as well as for surface effects the resulting spectra can be directly compared to experimental arpes data .    as stressed before",
    ", it is extremely difficult to see the magnetic anisotropy correctly in experimental spectra because of the twinning of crystals . here",
    "reference is made especially to the work of yi _",
    "et  al._@xcite , who did remarkable measurements on detwinned single crystals of and by applying uniaxial stress to the crystals .",
    "similar results were obtained for example by kim _ et  al._@xcite . in this context",
    "it is important to note that the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the magnetic 4-fe spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state is only half the size compared to the bz in the nonmagnetic 2-fe state .",
    "for that reason it is most appropriate to use in the following the notation for the 4-fe sdw  bz where the information of @xmath30 and @xmath31 from the nonmagnetic bz is down - folded to one @xmath32 point.@xcite    in fig .",

    "<S> by means of one - step model calculations the strong in - plane anisotropy seen in angle - resolved photoemission of the well - known iron pnictide prototype compounds and in their low - temperature antiferromagnetic phases is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the fully - relativistic calculations are based on the korringa - kohn - rostoker - green function approach combined with the coherent potential approximation alloy theory to account for the disorder induced by co substitution on fe sites in a reliable way . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations can be compared directly to experimental spectra of detwinned single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> one finds very good agreement with experiment and can reveal all features of the electronic structure contributing to the in - plane anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the local density approximation can capture most of the correlation effects for the investigated system without the need for more advanced techniques . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the evolution of the anisotropy for increasing co concentration @xmath0 in can be tracked almost continuously . </S>",
    "<S> the results are also used to discuss surface effects and it is possible to identify clear signatures to conclude about different types of surface termination . </S>"
