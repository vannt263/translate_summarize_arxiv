    "the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies continues to be an outstanding problem in astrophysics ( e.g. meza et al .",
    "2003 , wright et al . 2003 ) . in the current cdm models of hierarchical structure formation , mergers are the common process through which larger objects form from small ones ( frenk et al .",
    "1988 , kauffmann & white 1993 , lacey & cole 1993 ) . in this scenario , ellipticals are a ` natural ' outcome ( toomre 1977 ) and accumulating observational evidence seems to support this ( schweizer 1998 and references therein ) . however , an important challenge to the merger hypothesis is to explain how this seemingly random merging process can lead to the tight correlations found in ellipticals ( white 1997 ) .",
    "one of this correlations found in ellipticals is the so - called fundamental plane ( fp ) ; a linear relation , in the logarithmic space , among their effective radius , @xmath13 , their effective surface brightness , @xmath14 , and their one - dimensional central velocity dispersion , @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 .",
    "the fp exhibits a general trend that follows from the application of the virial theorem to ellipticals : @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the total mass , @xmath19 the 3-dimensional mean square velocity and @xmath20 the gravitational radius of the system ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the total kinetic and potential energy , respectively ) .",
    "assuming that ellipticals are homologous systems in equilibrium ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) with a constant mass - to - light ratio , the virial theorem leads to @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",
    "deviations of an observed fp from the theoretical expectation are attributed to variations of the mass - to - light ratio with luminosity and/or to the breaking of homology in galaxies ( e.g. trujillo , burkert & bell 2004 ) .",
    "the observed fp presents some differences depending on the wave - band spectrum and on the environment where galaxies reside @xcite .",
    "recently , from a sample of about @xmath29 elliptical galaxies taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained a fp relation given by @xmath30 ; where the @xmath5profile was assumed .    on the theoretical side , simulations of spiral mergers",
    "are numerous and have been extensively explored to study : the morphology of merger remnants ( e.g. mihos & hernquist 1996 ) , the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( e.g. bendo & barnes 2000 ) , and the effect of the orientation of the angular momentum of discs ( e.g. naab & burkert 2003 ) .",
    "other works have considered the effect of mergers on the properties of the fp ( e.g. capelato et al .",
    "1995 , levine & aguilar 1996 , bekki 1998 , dantas et al .",
    "2003 , nipoti et al .",
    "2003 , gnzalez - garca & van albada 2003 ) .",
    "a common feature of previous studies is that they have used models with properties chosen rather arbitrary resembling present day spiral galaxies . in particular ,",
    "those works addressing the fp of merger remnants have not considered self - consistent models of disc galaxies .",
    "disc galaxies also define a tight correlation between the maximum of their rotation velocity @xmath31 and their luminosity , termed the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation , that can be written as @xmath32 ; where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the ` slope ' and the zero - point , respectively .",
    "the observed values for @xmath33 lie between @xmath352.5 - 4 , depending on the waveband ( e.g. strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath36-band tf relation is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the absolute magnitude of the disc , and @xmath39 is the 21-cm hydrogen line width resulting in a slope of @xmath40 ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we study whether merger remnants of self - consistent @xmath0-body spirals satisfying the tf relation can lead to the fp of ellipticals .",
    "spirals properties are obtained from the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) in combination with the model of disc galaxy formation of mo , mao & white ( 1998 , hereafter mmw ) and the tf relation under the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "the rest of this work has been structured as follows : in @xmath41[sec : model ] we summarise the model used to set up the theoretical tf relation , the initial conditions and the orbital parameters for our simulations . in @xmath41[sec : results ] the results and a discussion are given .",
    "in this section we summarise the method and properties of our models to study the fp associated to merger remnants .      to construct a theoretical tf we use the press - schechter framework of hierarchical clustering and the model of mmw for the formation of galaxy discs . in this model",
    "five parameters are required to obtain the radial scale - length of a disc formed inside a spherical dark halo .",
    "these are the circular velocity , @xmath42 , the spin parameter , @xmath43 , the concentration of the halo , @xmath44 , the fraction of disc to halo mass , @xmath45 and the fraction of angular momentum in the disc , @xmath46 . to obtain @xmath47",
    "we have proceeded as in shen , mo & shu ( 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath2cdm cosmology was adopted to obtain the particular properties of disc galaxies ( with a mass density parameter of @xmath48=0.3 , a cosmological constant of @xmath49=0.7 , the hubble s constant @xmath50=0.7 , and the perturbation power - spectrum normalization @xmath51=1 ) .",
    "we have used the theoretical tf at @xmath1=1 , an epoch thought to be close to the one where formation of the discs occurred ( peebles 1993 ) , as our fiducial redshift to construct the numerical disc galaxies .",
    "this allowed us to consider remnants resulting from binary encounters and to compare them with ellipticals that might have formed through these encounters .",
    "present day massive ellipticals are probably the result of more than a binary merger , but their study is out of the scope of this work .",
    "we have selected only disc galaxies with a stability criterion @xmath52@xmath53@xmath54 , where @xmath52=@xmath55 , and @xmath31 is the maximum rotation velocity ( efstathiou , lake & negroponte 1982 ; syer , mao & mo 1997 ) .",
    "galaxies were evolved in isolation during 2 gyr , about twice the time needed for the first pericentric passage in the encounter . despite the fact that our galaxy models match the previous criterion some form a well defined bar ( b ) while in other cases they develop a transient bar ( t ) or remain stable ( s ) ( see last column of table  [ tab : glxmodels ] ) .    in figure  [ fig : tfzetas ] the tf relation , at redshift @xmath1=@xmath56 , is shown .",
    "the straight solid line indicates the observed slope of the tf in the @xmath36-band of equation ( 2 ) at the present epoch .",
    "a sample of twenty random points from this tf relation were selected in order to set up the self - consistent @xmath0-body disc galaxies .",
    "the dashed and solid lines correspond to the linear - square fit with a slope of @xmath57 and to the observed relation ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "the properties of discs of galaxies to be merged were selected from this ensemble . as an illustration , progenitors of mergers @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 of table  1 are shown.,width=321 ]      [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,>,>,^,^,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     our @xmath0-body disc galaxy models consist of a disc and a spherical dark halo component . following hernquist ( 1993 ) , disc particle positions are randomly drawn from the axisymmetric density profile : @xmath61 being @xmath62 and @xmath63 the radial and vertical scale length of the disc , respectively ; @xmath63 was chosen randomly in the range @xmath64 . for the halo",
    "we have adopted a modified version of the nfw  profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) with an exponential cut - off given by : @xmath65   \\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath66 being @xmath67 the complementary error function and @xmath68 the exponential integral , @xmath69 and @xmath70 the scale and virial radii of the halo respectively , @xmath71 the halo concentration , and @xmath72 is the halo total mass . finally , velocities are derived from jeans equations .",
    "the parameters characterizing our disc galaxy models are listed in table  [ tab : glxmodels ] ; where @xmath73 .",
    "we have also included the radius @xmath74 at which toomre s @xmath75 parameter is normalized and the number of particles in the halo , @xmath76 , and the disc , @xmath77 .",
    "notice the range of concentrations of haloes and galaxy disc sizes .",
    "our disc galaxy models do not include a central bulge component since , in the framework of mmw s galaxy formation , they tend to produce smaller disc sizes which require a better spatial resolution and smaller timesteps and , hence , more demanding computational resources .",
    "it is not clear how this central component will affect the fp of the remnants ; it will be addressed in a future work .",
    "we have considered only parabolic encounters where the initial separation between galaxy centres is @xmath78 the pericentre for each encounter is randomly selected in the interval @xmath79@xmath80(5,20)@xmath81kpc , consistent with the energies and eccentricities of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) .",
    "the relative orientation between galaxy spins is also taken randomly .    to evolve the numerical simulations we use the parallel version of gadget , an n - body / sph code with individual timesteps ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) . softening parameters of @xmath82=35@xmath81pc and @xmath83=350@xmath81pc",
    "were used for the disc and the halo particles , respectively .",
    "gadget uses a spline kernel for the softening , so that the gravitational interaction between two particles is fully newtonian for separations larger than twice the softening parameter ( power et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the typical time of arrival at pericentre is about @xmath84gyr , and all simulations were run for a total time of about @xmath85gyr ; this corresponds to about the time span from @xmath1=1 to @xmath1=0 in a @xmath2cdm scenario .",
    "remnants are already in a virial state by this time .",
    "all of our runs were performed on a cluster consisting of 32 pentium processors running at 450 mhz ( velzquez & aguilar 2003 ) .",
    "energy conservation was better than @xmath86% in all cases .",
    "to analyse the merger remnants a constant mass - to - light ratio , @xmath87 , is assumed ; hence @xmath88 is proportional to the effective surface luminous - mass density @xmath89 .",
    "we first compute their ` photometric ' properties ( @xmath90 ) and then its central velocity dispersion @xmath91 inside an aperture of radius @xmath92 .",
    "the surface density profiles @xmath93 were fitted using a srsic profile @xcite and the @xmath5 profile , we also fitted the corresponding growth curves of the luminous part of the remnants : @xmath94 .    to check how the photometric properties are affected by the adopted region to be fitted ,",
    "we have considered an aperture with outer radius of @xmath95kpc as in wright et al ( 2003 ) and for the inner radius of the fit , @xmath96 , we use two different values : ( 1 ) the resolution of the luminous component in our simulations , @xmath97pc , and ( 2 ) @xmath96=300@xmath81pc .",
    "this also allows us to test the effects of the boundaries of the fitting region on the values of the exponents @xmath98 of the fp ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "each remnant was ` observed ' from 100 random line - of - sights .",
    "a @xmath100minimisation by levenberg - marquart method @xcite was used to obtain @xmath101 and @xmath89 for each projection .",
    "the exponents @xmath98 of the fp were fitted to the complete set of projected values of the remnants , using both orthogonal and direct fits .",
    "the resulting values for these exponents are plotted in figure  [ fig : fptheor ] ( _ left panel _ ) .",
    "it can be seen how the values of parameters @xmath98 are sensitive to the fitting function ( profile or growth curve ) , to the adopted profile ( srsic or @xmath5 ) , to the fitting method ( direct or orthogonal ) and to the value of the radius @xmath96 .",
    "the observed values in the @xmath102band of the sdss have also been included ( star symbols ) .",
    "in particular , the dotted lines refer to the exponents of the fp of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : @xmath103 .",
    "this last relation is quite well reproduced by the model with @xmath96=100@xmath81pc , a srsic growth curve and an orthogonal fitting method ( hereafter our fiducial model , denoted by fp@xmath104 ) which is expressed by the relation @xmath105 with a standard deviation orthogonal to the plane of @xmath106 .",
    "uncertainties in the exponents were estimated using the bootstrap technique @xcite .",
    "table  2 lists the mean projected values of the quantities used to compute our fp@xmath107 and the mean srsic index .",
    "however , the exponents @xmath98 obtained by fitting the merger remnants with the @xmath5-profile have problems matching the observed ones , and this is independent of the fitting method ( orthogonal or direct ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath108pc and an orthogonal fitting , the r@xmath109-profile leads to a fp described by @xmath110 ( which will be denoted by fp@xmath111 ) , while for @xmath112pc it is given by @xmath113 ; notice that increasing @xmath96 tends to provide a slight better fit .",
    "an edge - view of our fp@xmath104 for the merger remnants ( filled squares ) is shown in figure  [ fig : fptheor ] ( _ right panel _ ) . as a reference",
    ", the long - dashed line indicates the slope , @xmath114 , for virialised homologous systems with a constant mass - to - light ratio while the solid and dotted lines refer to the sdss and to our fp@xmath104 , respectively .",
    "our merger remnants were artificially displaced to coincide with the zero - point of the fp of the sdss ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",

    "note that a direct fitting method shows larger differences between our fitted fp and that of the sdss ( see figure  [ fig : fptheor]-_right panel _ ) . despite that srsic",
    "s profile fitting leads to a better match with observations ; a consistent comparison will require an observational fp determined using this type of profile on the large data base of the sdss .",
    "the above results suggest that , ignoring any contribution from breaking - homology relations , it does not appear feasible to scale the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath133 , as a simple power - law of the luminosity , @xmath134 , ( or equivalently of the mass @xmath18 ) alone ; see also bernardi et al .",
    "perhaps , a more general relation of the form @xmath135 need to be explored . a more extensive study of the scaling relations of merger remnants , their non - homology",
    ", the distribution of luminous and dark matter , and their kinematics is under way and it will be presented in a future work .",
    "our results support the idea that mergers of spirals , with properties obtained from the tully - fisher relation within a @xmath2cdm cosmogony , lead to the tight correlation expressed by the fp .    in dissipational numerical simulations of mergers , it is found that a gas component can yield important differences in the stellar component of the remnants in comparison with their collisionless counterparts ( e. g. , barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "for instance , a gas component deepens the potential well , affecting more the remnant kinematics than its luminous profile .",
    "however , it is not clear from these results how the fp is going to be altered ; in particular , if its slope is going to be changed or just the dispersion of values around it .",
