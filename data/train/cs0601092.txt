    "in the recent years , mimo communications over multiple - antenna channels has attracted the attention of many researchers . in @xcite , a transmission technique called v - blast",
    "is introduced for high - rate communications over point - to - point mimo fading channels .",
    "v - blast sends independent symbols over different transmit antennas .",
    "therefore , it can also be used for mimo multi - access systems .",
    "most of the sub - optimum decoding methods for blast ( such as nulling and cancelling , zero forcing and gdfe - type methods ) can not achieve the maximum receive diversity which is equal to the number of receive antennas . in @xcite ,",
    "a lattice decoder is proposed for the decoding of blast which ( according to the simulation results ) achieves the maximum diversity . however , its complexity is exponential in terms of the number of antennas . in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , an approximation of lattice decoding , using the lll lattice - basis reduction @xcite ,",
    "is introduced which has a polynomial complexity and the simulation results show that it achieves the receive diversity . in this paper , we give a mathematical proof for achieving the receive diversity by the lll - aided zero - forcing decoder , which is one of the simplest forms of the lattice - reduction - aided decoders . also , a similar proof shows that the naive lattice decoding ( which discards the out - of - region decoded points ) achieves the receive diversity .",
    "a real ( or complex ) lattice @xmath0 is a discrete set of @xmath1-dimensional vectors in the real euclidean space @xmath2 ( or the complex euclidean space @xmath3 ) that forms a group under ordinary vector addition .",
    "every lattice @xmath0 is generated by the linear combinations of a set of linearly independent vectors @xmath4 , with integer ( or gaussian integer ) coefficients .",
    "the set of vectors @xmath5 is called a basis of @xmath0 , and the @xmath6 matrix @xmath7   $ ] , which has the basis vectors as its columns , is called the generator matrix of @xmath8 .    the basis of the lattice is not unique . indeed",
    ", we can obtain a new generator matrix by multiplying the old generator matrix by any @xmath9 unimodular matrix , where a unimodular matrix is defined as an integer matrix whose inverse has also integer entries . in many applications ,",
    "a basis consisting of relatively short and nearly orthogonal vectors is desirable .",
    "the procedure of finding such a basis for a lattice is called _ lattice basis reduction_. in @xcite , a basis - reduction algorithm , the so - called lll basis reduction , is introdiced which results in relatively short basis vectors with a polynomial - time computational complexity .",
    "we consider a multiple - antenna system with @xmath10 transmit antennas and @xmath11 receive antennas , where @xmath12 . in a multiple - access system",
    ", we consider different transmit antennas as different users .",
    "we consider vectors @xmath13^{t } $ ] , @xmath14^{t } $ ] , @xmath15^{t } $ ] and the @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 , as the received signal , the transmitted signal , the noise vector and the channel matrix , respectively denotes the hermitian of a matrix and @xmath18 denotes @xmath19 . ] .",
    "the following matrix equation describes the channel model : @xmath20 the channel is assumed to be raleigh and the noise is gaussian , i.e. the elements of @xmath17 are i.i.d with the zero - mean unit - variance complex gaussian distribution .",
    "also , we have the power constraint on the transmitted signal , @xmath21 .",
    "the power of the additive noise is @xmath22 per antenna , i.e. @xmath23 . therefore , the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is defined as @xmath24 .    in a mimo multiple - access system or a mimo point - to - point system with v - blast transmission",
    ", we send the transmitted vector @xmath25 with independent entries from @xmath26 $ ] , the set of complex gaussian integers . at the receiver , as the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimate of @xmath27 , a vector @xmath28 should be found among the possible transmitted vectors , such that @xmath29 is minimized . for large constellations , the exact ml decoding can be very complex and practically infeasible .",
    "therefore , we need to approximate it by a low - complexity scheme .    as a simple approximation of ml decoding , zero - forcing can be used , which selects @xmath28 as the closest integer point to @xmath30 .",
    "although zero forcing is very simple to implement , it has a poor performance .",
    "indeed , in zero forcing , @xmath31 is the effective noise , and when @xmath32 has a small singular value , @xmath33 can have very large row vectors , which result in magnifying the effective noise power . to overcome this shortcoming of the zero - forcing decoder , lattice - basis reduction",
    "is used in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to enhance the performance of zero forcing and reduce its effective noise .",
    "we can perform two slightly different types of lll - aided decoding :    * type i ) * we find @xmath34 as the closest integer point to @xmath35 where the @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 is the reduced version of @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an @xmath9 unimodular matrix ( when @xmath41 , we use the pseudo - inverse instead of the inverse ) .",
    "the transmitted vector is decoded as , @xmath42 in the absence of noise ( when @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 in the presence of the noise , @xmath45 can be seen as the effective noise ( instead of @xmath46 in the traditional zero forcing ) .    *",
    "type ii ) * we find @xmath34 as the closest integer point to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the reduced version of @xmath49 i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "the transmitted vector is decoded as , @xmath51 in the absence of noise ( when @xmath43 ) , @xmath52 in the presence of the noise , @xmath53 is the effective noise .    in the previous works",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite , the lll - aided decoding type ii has been used .",
    "we show that the type i method is more appropriate to reduce the effective noise , and indeed , has a better performance . in the next section ,",
    "we present the details of the proof of our main result for the first method and show that a similar proof is valid for the second method .",
    "for mimo systems , diversity is defined as @xmath54 . when there is no joint processing among the transmit antennas , the maximum achievable diversity is equal to @xmath11 , the number of receive antennas @xcite . to prove that lll - aided decoding achieves a diversity order of @xmath11 , we use a bound on @xmath55 , the orthogonality defect of the lll reduction , which is defined as @xmath56    [ see @xcite ] let @xmath57 be an @xmath58-dimensional complex lattice and",
    "@xmath59    $ ] be the lll reduced basis of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath55 is the orthogonality defect of @xmath60 , then , @xmath61    in the rest of this section , in the lemmas 1 - 3 , we bound the error probability by the probability of an inequality on @xmath62 ( the minimum distance among the points of the lattice generated by @xmath49 ) and the length of the noise vector being valid . in lemma 4 , we bound the probability that @xmath62 is too small .",
    "finally , in theorem 2 , we prove the main result by combining the bounds on the probability that @xmath62 is too small , and the probability that the noise vector is too large .",
    "consider @xmath63 $ ] as an @xmath64 matrix , with the orthogonality defect @xmath65 , and @xmath66 $ ] as the hermitian of its inverse ( or its pseudo - inverse if @xmath67 ) .",
    "then , @xmath68 and @xmath69    consider @xmath70 as an arbitrary column of @xmath71 .",
    "the vector @xmath70 can be written as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is orthogonal to @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "now , @xmath76 $ ] can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a unit - determinant @xmath79 matrix ( a column operation matrix ) : @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82^{\\mathtt{h } } [ \\mathbf{b}_{1} ... \\mathbf{b}_{i-1 } \\mathbf{b}_{i}^{\\prime } \\mathbf{b}_{i+1} ... \\mathbf{b}_{m}]\\right ) .\\ ] ] according to the hadamard theorem : @xmath83^{\\mathtt{h } } [ \\mathbf{b}_{1} ... \\mathbf{b}_{i-1 } \\mathbf{b}_{i}^{\\prime } \\mathbf{b}_{i+1} ... \\mathbf{b}_{m}]\\right )   \\leq\\ ] ] @xmath84 therefore , @xmath85 @xmath86 also , @xmath87 results in @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 now , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , both are orthogonal to the @xmath94-dimensional subspace generated by the vectors @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 the above relation is valid for every @xmath100 , @xmath101 . without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath102 : @xmath103 @xmath104 similarly , by using ( [ eq:15 ] ) , we can also obtain the following inequality : @xmath105    consider @xmath63 $ ] as a reduced basis ( lll ) @xcite for the lattice generated by @xmath38 , @xmath106 $ ] , and @xmath65 as the orthogonality defect of the reduction .",
    "then , if the magnitude of the noise vector is less than @xmath107 , the lll - aided decoding method correctly decodes the transmitted signal .",
    "when we use the lll - aided decoding method , we find the nearest integer point to @xmath108 .",
    "we should show that this point is the same as the transmitted vector ; or in other words , all the elements of @xmath109 are in the interval @xmath110 . to prove this ,",
    "we show that @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to show that ,    @xmath112    now , according to ( [ eq : lemma1 - 1 ] ) ,    @xmath113    therefore ,    @xmath114    by using the assumption of the lemma ,    @xmath115    @xmath116    consider @xmath63 $ ] as a reduced basis ( lll ) @xcite and @xmath117 as the minimum distance of the lattice generated by @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "then , there is a constant number @xmath118 ( independent of @xmath119 ) such that the lll - aided decoding method correctly decodes the transmitted signal , if the magnitude of the noise vector is less than @xmath120 .    for an lll reduction , @xmath121 therefore , if we consider @xmath122 ,    @xmath123    the basis @xmath60 can be written as @xmath124 for some unimodular matrix @xmath125 :    @xmath126    thus , @xmath127 $ ] is another basis for the lattice generated by @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , @xmath128 are vectors from the lattice generated by @xmath17 , and therefore , the length of each of them is at least @xmath129 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath130    thus , according to lemma 2 , lll - aided decoding method correctly decodes the transmitted signal .",
    "[ see @xcite ] assume that the entries of the @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 has independent complex gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance and consider @xmath117 as the minimum distance of the lattice generated by @xmath119 . then , there is a constant @xmath131 such that , @xmath132    for a mimo multi - access system ( or a point - to - point mimo system with the v - blast transmission ) with @xmath58 transmit antennas and @xmath1 receive antennas , when we use the lll lattice - aided - decoding , @xmath133    when @xmath134 , according to lemma 3 , we have no decoding error .",
    "thus , @xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138    @xmath139    the noise vector has complex gaussian distribution with variance @xmath140 per each real dimension .",
    "thus , by using the union bound , we can bound the second part of each product term as , @xmath141 also , for the first part of the product terms , we have , @xmath142 by using ( [ eq:23 ] ) and ( [ eq:24 ] ) , we can bound ( [ eq:22 ] ) .    * case 1 * , @xmath67 : @xmath143    @xmath144    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is a constant . therefore ,    @xmath147    * case 2 * , @xmath148 :    @xmath149    @xmath150    we are interested in the large values of @xmath151 . for @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154    @xmath155    @xmath156    where @xmath157 is a constant .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath158    in the above proof , we have considered the lll - aided decoding type i. in this case , the effective noise vector is equal to @xmath159 , compared to @xmath160 in zero - forcing . in the previous works",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite , the lll - aided decoding type ii has been used . for the type ii method ,",
    "the effective noise vector is equal to @xmath161 and the average energy of its @xmath162th component is proportional to the square norm of the @xmath162th column of @xmath163 . by using inequality ( [ eq : lemma1 - 2 ] ) from lemma 1 ( to bound the square norm of the columns of @xmath163 ) and using a similar proof as lemma 2 , we can show that the results of lemma 2 and theorem 2 are still valid .",
    "therefore , both of these lll - aided decoding methods achieve the receive diversity in v - blast mimo systems ( or multiple access mimo systems ) .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the first method is a more natural approach to reduce the power of the entries of the effective noise vector , and has a better performance ( see figure 1 ) . for the case of real lattices ,",
    "a latice - reduction - aided approach similar to type i is recently studied in @xcite and based on the concept of proximity factor , another justification for its superior performance over type ii is presented .",
    "transmit antennas and @xmath164 receive antennas with the rate @xmath165 bits per channel use . ]",
    "when we have a finite constellation , for each pair of constellation points , the pair - wise error probability can be bounded by chernoff bound ( similar to @xcite ) . by using the union bound",
    ", we can show that the exact ml decoding achieves the diversity order of @xmath11 , the number of receive antennas .",
    "however , when we use lattice decoding for a finite constellation and consider the out - of - region decoded lattice points as errors , achieving the maximum diversity by lattice decoding is not trivial anymore . nonetheless , by using lemma 4",
    ", we can show that this suboptimum method ( called the naive lattice decoding @xcite ) still achieves the maximum diversity .    for a mimo multi - access system ( or a point - to - point mimo system with the v - blast transmission method ) with @xmath58 transmit antennas and @xmath1 receive antennas , when we use the naive lattice decoding ,    @xmath133    when @xmath166 , we have no decoding error .",
    "thus , by using @xmath167 instead of @xmath168 in the proof of theorem 2 , we can bound @xmath169 by bounding @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the same result as theorem 2 .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that for the naive lattice decoding , we can find a family of lattices ( generating a family of space - time codes ) which achieves diversity order of @xmath10 ( @xmath171 is the number of transmit antennas ) .",
    "the current result shows that even if we use the codes generated by the integer lattice , the naive lattice decoding achieves the maximum receive diversity of @xmath11 ( number of receive antennas ) .",
    "we have shown that lll - aided zero - forcing , which is a polynomial - time algorithm , achieves the maximum receive diversity in mimo systems . by using lll reduction before zero - forcing , the complexity of the mimo decoding is equal to the complexity of the zero - forcing method with just an additional polynomial - time preprocessing for the whole fading block . also , it is shown that by using the naive lattice decoding , instead of ml decoding , we do not loose the receive diversity order .",
