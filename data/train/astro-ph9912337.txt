    "are supernovae ( sne ) round ?",
    "this simple question belies a menacing observational challenge , since all extragalactic sne remain unresolvable point sources throughout the crucial early phases of their evolution . since a hot young supernova ( sn )",
    "atmosphere is dominated by electron scattering , which , by its nature , is highly polarizing , a powerful tool for investigating sn geometry is spectropolarimetry of the expanding fireball shortly after the explosion ( fig .",
    "typical polarizations of @xmath0 are expected for moderate ( @xmath1 ) sn asphericity @xcite .",
    "detecting such low polarization requires a very high signal - to - noise ratio , which has limited previous detailed spectropolarimetric studies to only the two brightest recent events , sn 1987a @xcite and sn 1993j @xcite .",
    "we thus began a program to obtain spectropolarimetry of nearby sne using the 10-m keck telescopes .",
    "a complication in the interpretation of all polarization measurements is disentangling the polarization intrinsic to the object from interstellar polarization ( isp ) produced by dust along the line - of - sight .",
    "fortunately , the isp is constant with time and a smoothly varying function of wavelength .",
    "therefore , we consider distinct spectral polarization features , temporal changes in the overall polarization level , or continuum polarization characteristics differing from the known form produced by interstellar dust as evidence for intrinsic sn polarization .",
    "single - epoch polarization data for six sne of various types are shown in fig .",
    "since determining the intrinsic sn polarization level requires knowledge of the ( unknown ) isp , we focus instead on the sharp changes seen in the polarization at the location of strong features in the total flux spectra ; these features remain , regardless of the isp contribution .",
    "since all the objects studied possess spectropolarimetric line features , we conclude that _ all _ types of sne show evidence for intrinsic polarization at early times , suggesting that asphericity may be a ubiquitous sn characteristic .",
    "the fact that the strongest spectropolarimetric features are often seen in the troughs of strong p - cygni lines is not surprising .",
    "a simple explanation may be that p - cygni absorption selectively blocks photons coming from the central , more forward - scattered ( and thus less polarized ) regions , thereby enhancing the relative contribution of the more highly polarized photons from the limb regions ( c.f .",
    "1 ) . unfortunately , since different ( allowable ) choices for the isp can make inferred intrinsic polarization dips become peaks and vice - versa @xcite",
    ", we can not say for certain whether the changes seen here in p - cygni troughs represent increases or decreases in the intrinsic polarization level .",
    "we do note , however , that trough polarization increases are seen in the isp - corrected data of both sn 1987a @xcite and sn 1993j @xcite .    a total flux spectrum dominated by strong line emission without p - cygni absorption",
    "is a distinguishing characteristic of sne iin @xcite , likely resulting from an intense interaction between the sn and a dense circumstellar environment ( csm ) .",
    "sn 1997eg ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows sharp polarization changes across its strong , multi - component emission lines , suggesting distinct scattering origins for the intermediate ( full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath2 2000 km / s ) and broad ( fwhm @xmath2 15000 km / s ) components .",
    "two additional spectropolarimetric epochs ( not shown ) revealed a change in continuum polarization level of @xmath0 over 78 days , further confirming the presence of intrinsic polarization . a detailed analysis combining spectropolarimetry and total flux spectra of another iin event , sn 1998s , also found evidence for a highly aspherical ( @xmath3 ) continuum scattering region , with the csm likely distributed in a disk - like or ring - like morphology , quite similar to what is seen directly in sn 1987a @xcite , except much closer to the progenitor in the case of 1998s @xcite .",
    "the number of sne studied spectropolarimetrically is still very small , but early indications are that all types reveal intrinsic polarization if examined in sufficient detail . in addition to the implications of spectropolarimetry on the core - collapse mechanism , the mass - loss history of evolved stars , and the spatial distribution of sn ejecta , this work has direct consequences on the use of sne as cosmological distance indicators .",
    "although the empirically - based , standard - candle technique used to measure sn ia distances does not rely on spherical symmetry , distances derived to sne ii - p through the `` expanding photosphere method '' @xcite would need to be corrected for directionally - dependent flux if asphericity is found to be common among this sn class .",
    "we note that sn 1999em , a type ii - p event discovered shortly after this conference , showed no evidence for intrinsic polarization when it was observed less than two weeks after the explosion @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see if it remains unpolarized at an age comparable to the ii - p observation ( sn 1997ds , observed @xmath4 days after explosion ) presented here .",
    "we thank aaron barth for useful discussions and assistance with the observations and data reduction .",
