    "solitonic structure is an interesting and common subject in nonlinear science .",
    "it has been extensively studied in nonlinear optics @xcite , fluids @xcite and plasmas @xcite , magnetic films @xcite , nanotubes @xcite , and recently in quantum superfluid of atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in nontechnical terms , the shape of a soliton remains unaltered during propagation due to a balance of the spreading from its dispersion with nonlinear interactions .",
    "this feature has been applied with great success in optical soliton based advanced communications .    as realized in recent years an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec )",
    "provides a new and powerful tool for the study of nonlinear phenomena . at weak interactions , a condensate is successfully modelled by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , or the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite .",
    "feshbach resonance in recent years has provided a practical mechanism for adjusting the atomic s - wave scattering length through which both the sign and the strength of the atomic interactions become adjustable @xcite .",
    "bright matter wave soliton trains were realized in a @xmath1li condensate due to its attractive atom - atom interaction , while gray and dark solitons were realized for repulsively interacting condensates through the phase engineering technique on the condensate wave function @xcite .",
    "solitons with more than one parameter are often referred to as vector solitons .",
    "for instance , vector solitons are created in nonlinear optics if different polarizations or spatial modes of light in an optical fiber are taken as parameters .",
    "this could easily be implemented in a spinor condensate as the atomic internal degrees of freedom become available .",
    "many have suggested creating a manakov soliton in a two - component bec with attractive self - interactions @xcite .",
    "symbiotic solitons have also been investigated in a two - component bec with repulsive self - interactions accompanied by attractive cross - interactions @xcite .",
    "domain wall solitons can be created in a trapped two - component condensate even when both self- and cross - interactions are repulsive @xcite .",
    "more generally , self - consistent collective excitations of an atomic condensate , or higher eigen - states of the gross - pitaevskii equation , are also called solitons loosely because of their reasonable stability and resemblance to other properties of solitonic states @xcite .    with a far off resonant optical trap ,",
    "all hyperfine states of an atom can be confined simultaneously , thus realizing a spinor condensate , as has been reported in many experiments with @xmath2na and @xmath0rb atoms @xcite .",
    "the releasing of the spin degree of freedom has led to many novel properties lacking in a single component or scalar condensate .",
    "for instance , the spin exchange interaction as in a spin-1 condensate , whereby two @xmath3 atoms are converted into one @xmath4 atom , and one @xmath5 atom upon an elastic collision , already well understood @xcite , also helps to support the existence of spinor solitons . in a homogeneous system ,",
    "exact soliton solutions for an attractively interacting spin-1 condensate have been recently obtained analytically @xcite . also theoretical investigations have been carried out on magnetic ( or spinor ) solitons in a ferromagnetically interacting spin-1 condensate @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the more realistic case of spin solitons inside trapped atomic condensates ( of @xmath0rb ) .",
    "first we attempt to numerically find solitonic structures through the propagation in time of the gp equation for a trapped spin-1 condensate .",
    "then we demonstrate that the dynamics of the found spin solitons is stable and is related to the multi - domain structure as studied recently @xcite . finally , we discuss a rotating reference frame wherein the local spin distribution of the spinor condensate becomes stationary like a spatially propagating soliton in a moving reference frame .",

    "previously , kasamatsu and tsubota also noticed these similarities between the domains and the solitons in a system of two - component atomic condensates @xcite .",
    "we note that the oscillation period is about @xmath20 seconds , which is of the order of the experimental lifetime of the condensate @xcite .",
    "thus , it remains challenging to observe the spin soliton structure we study here .",
    "we also observe that the quantum diffusion time of the spin in the ground state condensate is only a few trap cycles , usually shorter than period of the soliton oscillations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our investigation focuses on excited state solitonic structures where the application of the single spatial mode approximation may become questionable @xcite . a more general treatment that potentially addresses these questions seems completely out of reach for the time being . on the other hand , as we reduced to @xmath91 , still a large number of trapped atoms",

    "<S> we numerically investigate a particular type of spin solitons inside a trapped atomic spin-1 bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with ferromagnetic interactions . within the mean field theory approximation </S>",
    "<S> , our study of the solitonic dynamics shows that the solitonic wave function , its center of mass motion , and the local spin evolutions are stable and are intimately related to the domain structures studied recently in spin-1 @xmath0rb condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a rotating reference frame wherein the dynamics of the solitonic local spatial spin distribution become time independent . </S>"
