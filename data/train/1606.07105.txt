    "authors have drawn attention to exciting possibilities related with the existence of the @xmath7 ev ) state and its decay channels . here",
    "one can mention a refinement of some fundamental laws and symmetries of nature , for example , the cp - violation , the variation of the fine structure constant @xcite , the local lorentz invariance and the einstein equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "unusual for traditional nuclear physics decay channels of the isomeric state ",
    "the electron bridge @xcite and nuclear light @xcite  probably imply that the @xmath7 ev ) state can be occupied by laser emission through nuclear photo - excitation process @xcite or inverse electron bridge @xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of such excitations is the detection of the @xmath8decay of the isomeric state @xcite with the possibility of checking the exponentiality of the decay law of an isolated metastable state at long times @xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention two important technological applications  the nuclear clock @xcite , and the gamma - ray laser of the optical range @xcite , both of which can lead to a breakthrough in their fields .    in the present study we have carried out calculations and give numerical estimations for the position of the sublevels of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 ev ) states in the highly charged ions @xmath2th@xmath3 and @xmath2th@xmath4 .",
    "the th@xmath3 ion has one electron which occupies the @xmath11 electron shell , while the th@xmath4 ion has three electrons on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 electron shells , i.e. the @xmath13 electron configuration .",
    "we have taken into account the bohr - weisskopf effect and the mixing of the states , and calculated the probabilities of the transitions between the sublevels .",
    "our calculations can be instrumental in experimental studies of the magnetic hyperfine ( mhf ) interaction in highly ionized atoms investigated in a storage ring of accelerator complex @xcite .",
    "a preliminary ( and as a rule , overestimated ) estimation of the mhf interaction can be obtained by using the fermi contact interaction @xcite .",
    "the electron in the @xmath11 state of the @xmath2th@xmath3 ion or electron in the @xmath12 state of the @xmath2th@xmath4 ion result in a strong magnetic field at the center of the @xmath2th nucleus @xcite .",

    "the interaction of the point magnetic moment of the ground state ( @xmath20 ) or the isomeric state ( @xmath21 ) of the @xmath2th nucleus with the magnetic field ( [ eq : h ] ) leads to a splitting of the nuclear levels .",

( [ eq : h ] ) . the details of the calculations of @xmath19 are given in the next section . for precise determination of @xmath19 the calculations should be self - consistent , relativistic and take into account the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "in the present work , the wave function @xmath29 of the electron in the @xmath30 configuration has been found numerically by solving the dirac equation in the coulomb potential of the nucleus with the radius @xmath31  fm ( where @xmath32 is the atomic number ) .",
    "the nucleus has been considered spherical with the homogeneous positive charge distribution . in this case",

    "the large ( @xmath39 ) and small ( @xmath40 ) radial components of the electron wave function @xmath41 are found from the system @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the electron wave function is normalized by the condition @xmath44 .    in the following we work with the variable @xmath34 instead of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bohr radius , commonly used in atomic physics because for calculations of the bohr - weisskopf effect we need a nuclear scale .",

    "we have assumed that two electrons in the @xmath11 state perfectly screen the nuclear charge + 2 , and @xmath51 .    in the second model",
    "we have used a more sophisticated approach by adding to the nuclear potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) the coulomb contribution from the electron density of two electrons in the @xmath11 state .",
    "the shortcoming of this calculation is that it does not take into account the interaction between electrons in the @xmath11 state and between electrons in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states .",
