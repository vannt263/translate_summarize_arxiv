    "demand for high quality produce e.g.  potatoes from retailers and their customers has resulted in these produce being subjected to rigorous quality control checks . for example , when improperly stored post - harvest without enough oxygen , potatoes exhibit a decay of their centres as their cells asphyxiate , a condition known as black heart .",
    "current methods for detecting black heart in a batch of potatoes are reliant on the statistical sampling and manually processed destruction .",
    "it s estimated that these destructive tests accounts for of the post - harvest wastage volume , with a net value of more than gbp  10  million .    as a means to reduce such wastage ,",
    "technologies for non - destructive testing ( ndt ) and their automation have become important in recent decades @xcite .",
    "possible technologies capable of ndt beneath a potato s surface exist , but they come with either safety issues e.g.  x - rays @xcite , or operational or throughput limitations e.g.  ultrasound @xcite .",
    "an alternative is microwave imaging which thus far has yet to have its ndt capabilities in a food processing setting explored . in this paper",
    "we will present a first evaluation on the use of microwave radiation in the ndt for the detection of black heart cavities in potatoes .",
    "to begin the study , how microwaves propagate through potato with and without black hearts needed to be understood .",
    "this part of the study involved the measurement of a potato s complex permittivity , the values of which were then used in a computer simulations as well as in the creation of a potato `` phantom '' that would be used in further experiments in lieu of a real potato .",
    "the complex permittivity of the melody variety of potato was measured with an aglient 85070-perf coaxial sensor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coax - photo ] ) using a method detailed in @xcite .",
    "a potato from a store bought batch had a patch of skin removed to provide a flat surface for the diameter sensor to contact .",
    "calibration of the coaxial sensors were carried beforehand using the reference liquid procedure from @xcite .",
    "the mean of six measurements is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : potatode ] , with the displayed uncertainties calculated using a monte carlo based procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the data shows that both components of the complex permittivity have high values due to the high water content of the potato .          with the measured values of a potato s complex permittivity in hand ,",
    "the data was used in a 3d electromagnetic finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) computer simulation of microwaves propagating into and through a potato .",
    "the simulation was carried out using commercially available software ( cst microwave studio ) .",
    "the aim of the simulation was to asses what changes the presence of a black heart cavity would have on the propagation of microwave radiation through a potato .",
    "this information would then be used to inform the design of the setup required for the lab - based measurements .",
    "the simulation consists of a potato modelled as a diameter sphere centred on the simulation space s origin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cstsetup ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : probes ] ) .",
    "the black heart cavity was modelled as a sphere with the electrical properties of a vacuum .",
    "microwave radiation , linearly polarised along the @xmath1-axis , was projected along the @xmath2-axis into the potato with an e - band ( ) waveguide .",
    "the waveguide s opening was drawn such that its edges matched that of the spherical potato s surface .",
    "in addition a hemispherical shell was added to the waveguide structure so that the waveguide facing side of the potato was encased .",
    "this was initially done to reduce the effect of surface waves that appeared in earlier simulations that did not have it .",
    "both the waveguide and shell material s were defined as a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) .",
    "two sets of simulation were run .",
    "one without a black heart cavity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cstsetup ] ) and one with ( fig .",
    "[ fig : probes ] ) .",
    "comparison of the results from the simulations was carried out by looking at the electric field strength along the @xmath3- and @xmath4-planes of the simulation space and by calculating the change in measured transmission magnitude from six virtual probes placed on the surface of the potato s exit face i.e.   @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : abs - xz ] shows the simulated electric field strength in the @xmath4- at when a black heart cavity is ( a ) not present and ( b ) is present . with no cavity present ,",
    "the fields are seen to show that the potato behaves in a manner of a lossy convex lens , bringing radiation to focus whilst absorbing it too .",
    "microwave radiation is transmitted out from the potato mainly from the point directly opposite the waveguide in the @xmath4-plane .",
    "the presence of the cavity reduces the amount radiation reaching the surface at points directly behind it as they are cast in the cavity s shadow .",
    "regions surrounding this point receive an increase in radiation due to the cavity ( with its lower permittivity than the surrounding potato ) behaving as a divergent lens , spreading radiation that was nt reflected off its first interface .",
    "measured by the probes in the computer simulations.,width=281 ]    the probe data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cst - void-1 ] as @xmath6 against frequency across the e - band .",
    "as expected from the previous analysis probe  x sees a decrease of across the band due to its location directly behind the cavity from the waveguide .",
    "probes  xz , z and xyz all show increases ranging between across the e - band , again as expected due to the cavity spreading radiation away from the point directly opposite the waveguide .",
    "probe  y sees effectively no change across the band , this may be due to the stronger fields in the @xmath3-plane ( figure not presented ) close to the edges of the shell where probe  y is located .",
    "these simulation data shows that values of @xmath6 as large as may be observed .",
    "the most reliably detected changes come from the probes located in the @xmath4-plane . by comparing which probes measure an increase , decrease or no change ,",
    "a cavity s presence and location may be deduced . using these results ,",
    "a lab - based experiment was designed .",
    "the need for a potato phantom was to allow the repeatable measurement of an object of known shape and size , that also exhibited the dielectric properties of a potato at the observed frequencies .",
    "real potatoes suffer from dehydration over time changing their internal properties , in addition to coming in a variety of sizes and irregular shapes . a solution consisting of , by weight , polysorbate  80 , sodium chloride and deionised water was created to perform as a potato phantom liquid .",
    "measurements with the npl coaxial sensor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coax - photo ] ) , using the procedure of @xcite show that it was successful in reproducing the complex permittivity of the potato between ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ralf - re ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ralf - im ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the real and imaginary components of the potato phantom and the measured potato values is within respectively .              to attain repeatable measurements , the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : labsetup ] was designed , based on the setup used in computer simulation of section  [ sec : simsetup ] . in this",
    "a waveguide transmits microwaves into a hdpe plastic bottle ( external diameter : , internal diameter : ) that is filled with potato phantom liquid from the previous subsection . at the same height as the waveguide , wrapped around the bottle s remaining circumference ,",
    "a flexible printed circuit board ( pcb ) with seven equidistantly separated murata smt antennas mounted on are used to measure the microwaves that were able to transmit through the bottle .",
    "an expanded polystyrene cylinder in height and in diameter was used as a black heart cavity phantom .",
    "several design choices and changes from the simulation setup were incorporated based on the results of the previous section .",
    "firstly , the waveguide was designed to be dielectrically loaded with macor^^ ceramic glass .",
    "this was to reduce the waveguide s dimensions to and to improve impedance matching between it and the potato .",
    "secondly , it was decided to only look for changes in the microwave transmission in the same plane as the waveguide .",
    "thirdly , for practical reasons the potato is represented as a cylinder rather than a sphere .        to obtain a reading ,",
    "a transmission reading is taken at the antennas without the cylinder submerged in the phantom liquid , @xmath8 , and another with it submerged in the bottle s centre to the depth of the waveguide and antennas , @xmath9 .",
    "a single reading of is then @xmath10 .",
    "measurements were taken with an anritsu ms2028c vector network analyser ( vna ) .",
    "the mean readings of @xmath11 from the seven antennas and the standard deviations are given in table  [ tab:11th - sept ] . as expected the antennas located most behind the cylinder , i.e.  , observed a decrease in received transmission when cylinder was present .",
    "however this was at a level much lower than expected based on the simulation results , for antenna 4 compared to for probe  x. the remaining antennas were expected to see a positive @xmath11 due to reflected microwaves .",
    "indeed that is seen in antennas , measuring an increase of and respectively .",
    "antennas see a decrease however .",
    "sss & mean @xmath11 , & s.d .",
    "@xmath11 ,   + 1 & -0.15 & 0.01 + 2 & -0.23 & 0.01 + 3 & -0.03 & 0.04 + 4 & -0.17 & 0.01 + 5 & -0.08 & 0.03 + 6 & 0.13 & 0.02 + 7 & 0.10 & 0.06 +    these first results demonstrate that detection of a phantom black heart cavity is possible by looking at the change in detected transmission levels of microwaves .",
    "the smaller than expected @xmath11 could be placed down to losses in the lab - based setup .",
    "mismatch between the curvatures of the waveguide and bottle limits how well the microwaves are transmitted into the bottle .",
    "the smt antennas are also not efficient in receiving microwave radiation in the same way as the virtual probes in the simulation are .",
    "further reductions may be accounted for from losses in the cables and pin switch .",
    "this asymmetry in the readings of antennas , , and , may be caused by misalignments in the setup .",
    "future work will look into the measurement of the microwave s phase component to detect presence of black heart cavities as well as making improvements to the setup .",
    "in this paper we describe the first attempt of the use of microwaves for the non - destructive testing of black heart cavities in potatoes .",
    "initially the complex permittivity of the melody variety of potato was measured , from which the values were used in an em fdtd simulation of a spherical potato without and with a cavity .",
    "the simulation data showed that changes in the amount of radiation reaching the surface between the two should allow the detection of a cavity .",
    "lab - based measurements using a potato and cavity phantom also saw changes , albeit at a lower level than the simulations .",
