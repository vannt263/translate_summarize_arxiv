    "the question of electronic structure of an atom with large charge number@xmath3 of the nucleus , especially with @xmath3 that is more than the critical value @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the finite structure constant , is of fundamental importance .",
    "the formulation of qed can not be considered really completed until an exhaustive answer to this question is given .",
    "although nuclei with overcritical charges can hardly be synthesized ( at present , the maximum is @xmath6 ) , the existing heavy nuclei can imitate the supercritical coulomb fields at collision .",
    "nuclear forces can hold the colliding nuclei together for @xmath7 or more .",
    "this time is enough to effectively reproduce the experimental situation where the electron experiences the supercritical coulomb field  @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of an atom with @xmath8 can be described by the dirac equation , which gives relativistic electronic spectra in agreement with experiment  @xcite . for such @xmath3 a complete set of solutions of the dirac equation exists",
    "; the corresponding coulomb field does not violate the vacuum stability , therefore , the furry picture in qed can be constructed , and the relativistic quantum mechanics of an electron in such a coulomb field based on the dirac equation is self - consistent .",
    "it was believed that the dirac equation with @xmath2 meets difficulties @xcite .",
    "one of the standard arguments is that the formula for the lower energy level , @xmath9 formally gives imaginary result for @xmath2 .",
    "this difficulty of the imaginary spectrum was attributed to an inadmissible singularity of the supercritical coulomb field at the origin for a relativistic electron , see @xcite .",
    "it was believed that this difficulty can be eliminated if a nucleus of some finite radius @xmath10 is considered .",
    "it was shown that with cutting off the coulomb potential with @xmath11 at a radius @xmath12 , the dirac hamiltonian has physically meaningful spectrum and eigenstates @xcite .",
    "but even in the presence of the cutoff , another difficulty arises at @xmath13 .",
    "namely , the lower bound state energy descends to the upper boundary @xmath14 of the lower continuum , and it is generally agreed that in such a situation , the problem can no longer be considered a one - particle one because of the electron - positron pair production , which , in particular , results in a screening of the coulomb potential of the nucleus .",
    "probabilities of the particle production in the heavy - ion collisions were calculated within the framework of this conception  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental conditions for verifying the corresponding predictions are unavailable at present .",
    "not disputing the fact that taking account of a finite size of the nucleus corresponds to a more realistic setting up the problem , we do not agree with the assertion that the dirac hamiltonian with the coulomb field of overcritical point - like nucleus charge is inconsistent .",
    "the above - mentioned difficulties with the spectrum for @xmath2 do not arise if the dirac hamiltonian is correctly defined as a self - adjoint ( s.a . )",
    "a first heuristic attempt in this direction is due to @xcite . a rigorous mathematical treatment of all the aspects of this problem including a spectral analysis of the hamiltonian based on the theory of s.a . extensions of symmetric operators and the krein method of guiding functionals was presented in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that from a mathematical standpoint , a definition of the dirac hamiltonian as a s.a .",
    "operator presents no problem for arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "a specific feature of the overcritical charges is a nonuniqueness of the s.a .",
    "dirac hamiltonian , but this nonuniqueness is characteristic even for @xmath15 . for each @xmath16 , there exist a family of s.a .",
    "dirac hamiltonians parametrized by a finite number of extra parameters(and specified by additional boundary conditions at the origin ) .",
    "the existence of these parameters is a manifestation of a nontrivial physics inside the nucleus .",
    "a real spectrum and a complete set of eigenstates can be evaluated for each hamiltonian , so that a relativistic quantum mechanics for an electron in such a coulomb field can be constructed .    in the present article",
    ", we briefly summarize all the previously obtained formal results in a form more suitable for physicists with some additional new important details and numerical calculations of the electronic spectra .",
    "the spectrum of each hamiltonian consists of a universalcontinuous part that is a union of two intervals @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 and a specific discrete spectrum located in the interval @xmath19 .",
    "we concentrate on the discrete spectrum",
    "we consider an electron of charge @xmath20 and mass @xmath21  moving in the coulomb field of charge @xmath22 .",
    "we describe this field by a scalar electromagnetic potential of the form @xmath23 , we set @xmath24 in what follows .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of an atom with @xmath0 can be described by the dirac equation with the coulomb field of a point charge @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it was believed that the dirac equation with @xmath2 meets difficulties because the formula for the lower energy level of the dirac hamiltonian formally gives imaginary eigenvalues . but </S>",
    "<S> a strict mathematical consideration shows that difficulties with the electronic spectrum for @xmath2 do not arise if the dirac hamiltonian is correctly defined as a self - adjoint operator . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly summarize the main physical results of that consideration in a form suitable for physicists with some additional new details and numerical calculations of the electronic spectra . </S>"
