    "the prominent emission line spectra of quasars provide valuable information on the physical state and chemical composition of the gas close to the quasars .",
    "if this gas was processed by stars in the surrounding host galaxy then the abundances we measure from the emission lines are a diagnostic of the star formation history in these environments ( see hamann & ferland 1999 for a general review ) . at redshifts",
    "@xmath6 , when the universe was only @xmath11 to 2 gyr old ( depending on cosmological models , see figure 1 in hamann & ferland 1999 ) , the results are especially interesting because they provide information about very early star formation , galaxy evolution , and chemical enrichment ( ostriker & gnedin 1997 ; friaca & terlevich 1998 ) .    ratios of emission lines involving nitrogen , n , are valuable in determining the metallicity , @xmath7 , because of the expected  secondary \" n production via the cno cycle ( shields 1976 ) .",
    "the nitrogen abundance therefore scales as @xmath8 = ( o / h)@xmath9 and n / o scales as @xmath7 = o / h , providing a sensitive metallicity diagnostic even when direct measures of @xmath7 = o / h are not available ( shields 1976 ; ferland et al .",
    "1996 ; hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 , 1999 ) .",
    "observations of regions indicate that secondary nitrogen production dominates for @xmath10 ( van zee et al .",
    "1998 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1993 ) .",
    "when secondary nitrogen production dominates , the n abundance is given by : @xmath11\\ \\approx\\ [ { \\rm o}/{\\rm h } ] - q\\ \\approx\\ \\log(z/{\\hbox{z$_{\\odot}$ } } ) - q\\ ] ] where the square brackets indicate logarithmic ratios relative to solar ( hamann et al .",
    "2001 ) . in environments with high star formation rates and short enrichment times ,",
    "chemical evolution models predict that nitrogen production should be delayed relative to oxygen and carbon . in equation 1 , @xmath12 is the logarithmic offset caused by this delay .",
    "it is believed to range from @xmath10.00.1 for  slow \" chemical evolution , such as in regions , to @xmath10.20.5 for rapid evolution , such as may occur in massive galactic nuclei ( hamann et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "studies of both emission and absorption lines in quasars suggest that their metallicities are near or above the solar value ( dietrich et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; osmer et al . 1994 ; constantin et al . 2001 ; petitjean et al . 1994 ; hamann 1997 ; hamann & ferland 1999 ; hamann et al .",
    "these metallicities are consistent with both observational studies ( pettini 2001 ) and theoretical simulations ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) showing that metal abundances at any time in the universe are dependent on the local density . at every epoch ,",
    "higher density regions , such as the central regions of galaxies , where quasars reside , should have much higher metallicities than lower density regions such as galactic halos or the intergalactic medium .",
    "this dependence of metallicity on density seems to be stronger than any relationship to age ( i.e. old does not necessarily mean metal poor ) .",
    "evidence that density affects metallicity much more than age is found even in our own galaxy , where the central bulge contains many old but metal rich stars ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ; idiart et al . 1996 ) .",
    "much of the previous emission line analysis relied on the line ratios of @xmath13/ @xmath14 and / @xmath15",
    ". ratios of various weak intercombination lines can be used to test that analysis . in this paper",
    ", we measure the emission lines in the rest frame uv spectrum of the high redshift ( @xmath0 ) quasar br2248 - 1242 ( storrie - lombardi et al . 1996 ) , and we examine line ratios involving nitrogen to estimate the metallicity .",
    "we selected br2248 - 1242 from a sample of 44 @xmath16 quasars in constantin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) because it has unusually narrow emission lines with large equivalent widths , making the weak intercombination lines , such as ] @xmath17 , ] @xmath18 , and ] @xmath19 , easier to detect .",
    "this is the most comprehensive emission - line abundance analysis so far for a @xmath20 quasar .",
    "the spectrum of br2248 - 1242 was obtained at the mmt observatory with the red spectrograph on september 11 , 1994 .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) spectral resolution is @xmath110  which yields a difference of only @xmath110% between the observed and actual fwhm of even the most narrow component .",
    "the wavelength range was chosen to span the redshifted  @xmath21 to ] @xmath19 interval .",
    "this corresponds to an observed wavelength range of @xmath15500 to nearly 10,000  .",
    "the observation and data reduction details are discussed in constantin et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed spectrum .",
    "we measured the emission lines using tasks in the iraf software package .",
    "we obtained the galactic column density ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and calculated a reddening of @xmath22 .",
    "we then performed a reddening correction and used the task nfit1d to fit the continuum with a powerlaw of the form @xmath23",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the fit has a spectral index , @xmath26 ( see figure 1 ) and is constrained by the flux in wavelength intervals between the emission lines , namely 69136991  , 87338898  , and 92789777  .",
    "we next used the task specfit ( kriss 1994 ) , which employs a @xmath27 minimization routine , to fit each line with one or more gaussian profiles .",
    "figure 2 shows the fits .",
    "table 1 lists the line fluxes and rest - frame equivalent widths ( rews ) as measured above the fitted continuum .",
    "the fluxes , rews , and fwhms given in table 1 are from the total fitted profiles , which can include several multiplet components and up to 3 gaussian profiles per component ( see below ) .",
    "table 2 lists the rest wavelength , flux , rew , and fwhm of each individual gaussian profile .",
    "we calculate the emission line redshift to be @xmath28 based on the narrow gaussian profiles fit to  and .",
    "we use this redshift to calculate the rest wavelength for each component .",
    "we fit @xmath29 with three gaussian profiles , including a very broad profile ( fwhm @xmath30  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this broad pedestal includes the unidentified @xmath11600   emission feature that has been noted in earlier studies ( laor et al .",
    "1994 ; boyle 1990 ; wilkes 1984 ) .",
    "we ignore the doublet splitting in because it is small compared to the observed line widths . ]",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath14 , and ] @xmath18 are all fit with one gaussian profile .",
    "each component of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 doublets are fit with one gaussian profile .",
    "the fluxes of these components are tied to a 1:1 ratio because this yields a better fit than a 2:1 ratio . in every multiplet fit",
    ", we fix the ratio of the central wavelengths to the known ratio of the rest wavelengths and tie together the fwhms of each component .",
    "the ] @xmath19 and ] @xmath33 multiplets are fit with one gaussian profile for each of their 5 components . the flux component ratios in these cases are tied to the ratio of the statistical weight @xmath34 times the @xmath35 value for each transition , using atomic data obtained from the national institute of standards and technology ( http://aeldata.phy.nist.gov/physrefdata/contents-atomic.html ) and nussbaumer & storey ( 1982 ) .",
    "@xmath36 @xmath21 is fit with three gaussian components , with only the red side used for @xmath27 minimization because of contamination by the  forest on the blue side .",
    "each component of the @xmath13 doublet is fit with two gaussian profiles with fwhms fixed to the values obtained from the narrow and intermediate width profiles of our fit to .",
    "this connection between and can be justified because they are both high ionization lines with similar excitation and emission properties ( dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ) . the relative fluxes of the two components of the doublet are set to 2:1 for each component , again because this yields a better fit than a 1:1 ratio .",
    "we fit the @xmath37 triplet with one gaussian profile for each of the three components .",
    "because the flux of is so much smaller than @xmath36 and , is not well defined by the @xmath27 minimization .",
    "the primary uncertainty in our flux measurements is the continuum location .",
    "many of the lines are blended , which introduces more uncertainty , particularly for in the wing of @xmath38 the broad component in the fit introduces another uncertainty because it includes the @xmath11600   feature .",
    "we do not include this broad component in our calculated of flux ratios (  3  below ) because it is believed to be an unrelated emission feature ( laor et al .",
    "we estimate the one @xmath39 standard deviation of our measurement of the flux of @xmath36 to be @xmath110% based on repeated measurements with the continuum drawn at different levels . by the same method ,",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in , , , and ] to be @xmath11520% and the uncertainty in the remaining lines with rew @xmath40   to be @xmath125% .",
    "table 3 lists various measured flux ratios and the metallicities inferred from comparisons to the theoretical results from hamann et al .",
    "our preferred estimates of the metallicity are obtained from the model in hamann et al . that uses a segmented powerlaw for the photoionizing continuum shape ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this continuum shape is a good approximation to the average observed continuum in quasars ( zheng et al .",
    "1997 ; laor et al .",
    "the metallicity ranges in table 3 represent the range of results obtained by comparisons to all three different continuum shapes calculated by hamann et al . and shown in figure 3 .",
    "these theoretical uncertainties are in addition to any uncertainty in the measured line strengths (  2 ) .",
    "all of the line ratios in table 3 yield a metallicity of @xmath41 13 . from a theoretical viewpoint , ] / ] is the most reliable of the intercombination line ratios ( hamann et al .",
    "/ is also a useful ratio , whereas ] / ] and ] / can be unreliable because they are more sensitive to non - abundance effects and generally yield a wider range of results than ] / ]",
    ". based on which ratios are most accurately measured , and which are most reliable from a theoretical viewpoint ( hamann et al .",
    "2001 ) , we estimate the overall metallicity of br2248 - 1242 to be roughly @xmath41 2 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the actual metallicity of br2248 - 1242 may be 23 times higher than @xmath41 2  because the theoretical models we use assume @xmath42 in equation 1 . for environments with rapid chemical evolution , such as massive galactic nuclei",
    ", @xmath430.5 may be more appropriate ( hamann et al . 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the metallicity of br2248 - 1242 is broadly consistent with previous emission line results of @xmath41 19  derived for other quasars ( hamann et al .",
    "2001 ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ; hamann & ferland 1999 ; korista et al . 1998 ; ferland et al .",
    "1996 ) .    for any appropriate @xmath12 value",
    ", br2248 - 1242 may still yield a lower bound on the metallicity of luminous quasars because it appears to have an unusually low black hole mass ( and so may reside in a lower mass , lower metallicity galaxy ) .",
    "we estimate the black hole mass in br2248 - 1242 to be @xmath44 , based on the measured fwhm of and the formulae given in kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xmath45 ^{0.700 \\pm 0.033 } \\ { \\rm lt - days}\\ ] ] @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the radius of the broad line region for @xmath48 , and @xmath47 ( ) @xmath49 0.5 @xmath50 is the radius of the region ( peterson 2001 ) .",
    "the fwhm of ( 1620 km @xmath51 ) is represented by @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "we derive @xmath54 from the observed flux ( dietrich et al .",
    "2002 in preparation ) and use a powerlaw of the form @xmath23",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 with @xmath55 to approximate the continuum shape and estimate @xmath56 .",
    "we select @xmath55 based on average quasar spectra from vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and dietrich et al .",
    "( 2002 in preparation ) .",
    "the derived black hole mass in br2248 - 1242 is unusually low because of its unusually narrow emission lines .",
    "previous studies suggest a correlation between black hole mass and the overall bulge / spheroidal component mass of the surrounding galaxy ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ; ferrarese & meritt 2000 ; laor 2001 ; wandel 1999 ) . together with the well known relationship between the mass and metallicity of galaxies ( faber 1973 ; zaritsky et al . 1994 ; jablonka et al .",
    "1996 ) , these results predict a relationship between the mass of the black hole and the metallicity surrounding the quasar ( warner et al .",
    "2002 in preparation ) .",
    "br2248 - 1242 appears to have a low black hole mass , and so may be expected to have relatively low metal abundances .",
    "the result for @xmath57 in br2248 - 1242 suggests that an episode of rapid and extensive star formation occurred before the observed @xmath0 epoch .",
    "the spectral similarity of br2248 - 1242 to other @xmath20 quasars ( apart from the narrow line widths , see constantin et al .",
    "2001 ) suggests further that the resulti for @xmath57 should apply generally .",
    "the time available for the chemical enrichment at @xmath0 is only @xmath11.5 gyr ( for h@xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "this star formation episode early in the history of the universe would be consistent with observations showing that the central regions of massive galaxies today contain old , metal rich stars ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ; bruzual et al .",
    "1997 ; worthey et al . 1992 ; idiart et al .",
    ". this high redshift evolution would also be well within the parameters derived in some recent simulations , which show that the densest proto - galactic condensations can form stars and reach solar or higher metallicities at @xmath58 ( ostriker & gnedin 1997 ; haiman & loeb , 2001 ) .",
    "recent observations of the highest redshift quasars suggest that reionization occurred around @xmath59 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "if the reionization is due to stars , this would provide further evidence for substantial star formation beginning at @xmath58 .",
    "quasar abundance studies can provide observational tests of these evolution scenarios .",
    "the next step is clearly to extend the abundance analysis to the highest possible redshifts , and to compare the results across wide ranges in redshift , host galaxy types , and central black hole mass .    _",
