    "over an year ago , we studied an ising model on a cubic lattice @xcite by use of the @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "the study is based upon the high temperature expansion and the resulting series rewritten in the inverse of a mass squared @xmath1 is transformed by the @xmath0-expansion which played a crucial role in the estimation of critical quantities . however the foundamentals of the estimation protocol , which will be explicitly stated in the next section , have not been thoroughly investigated so far .",
    "this paper deals with the issue in enough depth via the study of ising models at one- and two - dimensions where the models are solved and high temperature expansion is available to very large orders .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to improve the estimation protocol of critical quantities employed in ref .",
    "we will give a renewed procedure and confirm it works better in the low dimensional models , where the estimation of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be presented on the square lattice . the new protocol",
    "would be applicable to high dimensional models and even field theoretic models . before the application to these more interesting models , it needs a detailed test on well understood models .",
    "the ising model we consider is a pure one without applied forces , specified by the action@xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the inverse temperature and @xmath7 means the pair of nearest neighbor sites .",
    "it is well known that a one - dimensional model is in the one phase and the square lattice model undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath8 .",
    "one often discusses critical behaviors of thermodynamic quantities in terms of @xmath9 @xcite where @xmath4 stands for the critical temperature . in the high temperature region , in contrast , thermodynamic quantities are expanded in @xmath6 . as the temperature approaches from a hot region to the vicinity of the critical point , the effective parameter changes from @xmath6 to @xmath10 .",
    "we feel that this exchange in the basic descriptive parameter is somewhat strange .",
    "there exists , however , a sole parameter effective in the high - temperature phase .",
    "we note that the second order transition is activated by the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "the physics is controlled by correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "the critical point is specified as the point where @xmath11 is divergent and this means that , irrespective of specific value of @xmath4 which is of non - universal , the critical point is universally specified by the point of @xmath12 or the massless point @xmath13 where @xmath1 should be understood as suitably related to @xmath11 .",
    "if one describes the system in @xmath1 , even the temperature is a function of @xmath1 ( one can obtain @xmath14 by the inversion of @xmath15 ) and the critical temperature is given by the limit @xmath16 the high - temperature expansion corresponds to the @xmath17 expansion . from the large mass side , we access the critical point with the crucial help of the @xmath0-expansion @xcite . by making use of the fact that the critical point is at the massless point , we will explore a new way of handling high - temperature expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , the @xmath0-expansion is reviewed .",
    "we posit a base on which the estimation protocol is constructed . in sec . 3",
    ", a one - dimensional case is taken up to analytically study the @xmath0-expansion to arbitrary orders . in sec .",
    "4 , a two - dimensional model on the square lattice is numerically revisited . the parametric extension proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is re - formulated by the linear differential equation ( lde ) with constant coefficients .",
    "the spectrum of exponents in the series expansion in the vicinity of the critical point is given by the spectrum of roots of the characteristic equation of the lde satisfied by the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the critical temperature and the amplitudes appear as the integration constants . studies to quite large orders tell us that the computational base under the @xmath0-expansion is numerically confirmed .",
    "then , under a new protocol to be proposed , we demonstrate that the estimation becomes more accurate . in the final section ,",
    "we give concluding remarks .",
    "the @xmath0-expansion originates in the dilatation of the scaling region . with the dilatation rate @xmath18 @xmath19 , the change of the parameter from @xmath1 to @xmath20 by @xmath21 in a given thermodynamic quantity @xmath22 induces a dilatation transform as follows : consider the large mass expansion truncated at order @xmath23 , @xmath24",

    "let us explain the effect of @xmath0-expansion .",

    "then , our task is to obtain the critical information of the supposed behavior @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "there are other types of critical behaviors such that @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these are typical in the study of phase transition as these two represent the divergences of thermodynamic functions .",
    "let us explain one of the advantages in the @xmath0-expansion , taking the scaling form ( [ scaling1 ] ) as an example .",
    "the construction via @xmath0-expansion gives @xmath53=\\omega_{0}+c_{1}c_{n,-\\lambda_{1}}t^{-\\lambda_{1}}+c_{2}c_{n,-\\lambda_{2}}t^{-\\lambda_{2}}+\\cdots .",

    "the first term is most important and the rest acts as the corrections to the first one . in the limit @xmath54 ,",
    "respective terms of the corrections tend to vanish since @xmath55 this represents the scaling of the amplitude @xmath56 at large enough order .",
    "thus , as @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the @xmath59th - order correction tends to zero for fixed @xmath34 .",
    "this is quite convenient for the estimation of @xmath60 .",

    "we shall deeply investigate the point in two solvable models in the following sections .",
    "in the one - dimensional ising model , it is well known that the exact correlation length @xmath11 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "then , the mass squared @xmath1 defined by the zero momentum limit of correlation function is obtained by @xmath67 .",

    ", we understand that @xmath2 can be estimated first and then , @xmath338 and @xmath4 in the bias of estimated @xmath2 .",
    "it is logically natural that universal quantities are directly estimated by the large @xmath1 expansion .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 has a special role in our approach because any typical thermodynamic quantity scales as @xmath393 and the first correction has the extra power @xmath224 due to the relation @xmath394 near the critical point .    in the traditional method such as dlog pad @xcite and differential approximants methods",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 is involved in the estimation equations .",
    "many estimation data are supplied in a given order and the statistical processing of those data is employed and the average becomes accurate compared to the raw data themselves . in our method , in contrast , we have essentially a unique estimate .",
    "thus , there is no room for the statistical processing of the data .",
    "the accuracy is not superior to those in the traditional approaches , but the logic is alternative and would be interesting since a direct path to the exponent is opened .",
