    "supernovae of typesii and ib / ic are thought to occur during core collapse in massive stars at the end of their lifetimes .",
    "however the only definite detection of a sn progenitor is that of sn1987a in the lmc @xcite , which was a blue supergiant ( b3i ; ) .",
    "the progenitor of sn1993j in m81 was possibly identified as a k0ia star @xcite .",
    "neither progenitor is consistent with the canonical stellar evolution picture , where core - collapse occurs while the massive star is an m - supergiant .",
    "we still do nt understand the physical mechanisms which underpin the different supernovae types , and how these are related to the evolution of the progenitor star .",
    "there is an understandable lack of observational data to constrain the last moments of stellar evolution .",
    "this conference is dedicated to understanding the basic building blocks of galaxy evolution , and supernova physics is a fundamental input parameter in determining the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies from the first stars in the universe to present day gas - rich galaxies .",
    "linking the observed supernova types to a stars initial mass , metallicity , binarity , environment and its subsequent evolution is not only important for those of us working on massive stellar evolution , it will also impact on galaxy evolution as a whole .",
    "the very well maintained data archives of the hubble space telescope , the canada - france - hawaii telescope , the isaac newton group of telescopes and those of eso contain a vast array of multi - colour images of late - type galaxies within approximately 20mpc . at the spatial resolution of ground - based telescopes , the most luminous individual massive stars can be resolved and their photometry accurately measured in galaxies within @xmath18mpc . at the resolution of wfpc2 on board hst we can extend these measurement of individual massive stars to fainter intrinsic luminosities and distances out to @xmath120mpc ; the cepheid key project is a clear demonstration of this @xcite .",
    "hence when a bright supernova is discovered in a spiral galaxy within @xmath120mpc there is now a reasonable chance that images have been taken of this galaxy either with hst or a ground based facility - allowing the exciting prospect of directly identifying the star which has exploded .    towards the end of 1999 two",
    "bright supernovae were discovered in the spirals ngc1637 ( 7.5mpc ) and ngc3184 ( 8mpc ) . these events ( 1999em and 1999gi ) were both type ii - p , with very similar peak magnitudes ( @xmath2 ) , very similar @xmath1100 day plateaus , and were both very faint x - ray and radio sources . by chance",
    "there are archive images of these galaxies taken several years before explosion by cfht and hst .",
    "similar resolution images taken after explosion have allowed the supernova position to be precisely determined on the pre - explosion frames . however in both cases _ there is no detection of a progenitor star at the sn position_. unfortunately the precursor objects are below the detection limits ( see fig.1 for example of 1999gi ) . by measuring the sensitivity limits of the images , the bolometric luminosity limits of the progenitors ( as a function of stellar effective temperature ) have been determined .",
    "these can be plotted on an hr - diagram with stellar evolutionary tracks , which allows one to estimate the initial mass of the progenitor ( see fig.2 for example ) . in and",
    "upper mass limits of 9m@xmath0and 12m@xmath0for 1999gi and 1999em respectively were derived , with uncertainties of @xmath33m@xmath0 .",
    "these sne are very similar in their observed characteristics and have rather similar mass limits .",
    "in particular the low values of their x - ray and radio fluxes ( and ) suggest that the progenitor star had a relatively low mass - loss rate , which is consistent with the fairly low masses we derive .",
    "this is consistent with the progenitor stars having initial masses between 9 - 12m@xmath0 , and having exploded as red - supergiants which have undergone normal mass - loss in the agb phase .",
    "have speculated that this type of homogeneous plateau event ( which are generally x - ray and radio faint ) could all come from moderate mass 8 - 12m@xmath0  progenitors , and that a salpeter imf would suggest that @xmath150% of all core - collapse events should be similar to 1999gi and 1999em if this is true . to test this hypothesis we require better statistics on the relative numbers of the sn sub - types _ and _ crucially more direct information on progenitors .",
    "the two examples described show how having high - quality archive images of sne sites taken _ prior to explosion _ can allow quite stringent limits to be set on the nature of the progenitor stars .",
    "this will be improved in the future if we do get a real detection , rather than only a limiting mass .",
    "the chances of having suitable pre - explosion images available when a nearby core - collapse supernova is discovered are improving rapidly . by june 2002",
    ", a wfpc2 snap programme will be finished ( 9042 , pi : smartt ) which will enhance the number of late - type galaxies with high - quality archive images . combining these with data available in the ground - based archives",
    "have estimated that on average @xmath4 sne per year will have pre - explosion information and hence a project lasting 3 - 5 years should significantly improve our knowledge .",
    "in particular this project has been greatly aided by the introduction of the astrovirtel initiative which is a first step at creating tools for future and more wide ranging virtual observatories .",
    "it is an example of exciting science that can easily be made possible with the european avo .",
    "this is complemented with two hst go approved proposals in cycle10 and cycle11 ( 9042 and 9353 ) that will provide the accurate astrometry of the supernova for positioning on the pre - explosion images .",
    "already we have one more candidate that has pre - explosion hst data found by astrovirtel ( 2001du ; ) with follow - up hst too images of the sn position just taken at the end of november 2001 ."

    "<S> the masses and the evolutionary states of the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae are not well constrained by direct observations . stellar evolution theory generally predicts that massive stars with initial masses less than about 30m@xmath0  should undergo core - collapse when they are cool m - type supergiants . </S>",
    "<S> however the only two detections of a sn progenitor before explosion are sn1987a and sn1993j , and neither of these was an m - type supergiant . attempting to identify the progenitors of supernovae is a difficult task , as precisely predicting the time of explosion of a massive star is impossible for obvious reasons . </S>",
    "<S> there are several different types of supernovae which have different spectral and photometric evolution , and how exactly these are related to the evolutionary states of the progenitor stars is not currently known . </S>",
    "<S> i will describe a novel project which may allow the direct identification of core - collapse supernovae progenitors on pre - explosion images of resolved , nearby galaxies . </S>",
