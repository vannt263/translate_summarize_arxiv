    "it has been widely recognized that astrophysical large - scale magnetic fields originate due to the mean - field dynamo ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such dynamo can be driven by the joint action of the mean kinetic helicity of turbulence and large - scale differential rotation .",
    "on the other hand , recently performed numerical experiments @xcite have demonstrated existence of a nonhelical large - scale dynamo in a turbulence with a large - scale shear whereby mean @xmath0 effect vanishes .",
    "note that a sheared turbulence is a universal feature in astrophysical @xcite and laboratory @xcite flows .",
    "one of the possible mechanism of the nonhelical large - scale dynamo in a homogeneous sheared turbulence is a shear - current effect that has been extensively studied during recent years ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the deformations of the original nonuniform magnetic field lines are caused by upward and downward turbulent eddies . in a sheared turbulence the inhomogeneity of the original mean magnetic field breaks a symmetry between the influence of the upward and downward turbulent eddies on the mean magnetic field .",
    "this creates the mean electric current along the mean magnetic field and results in the nonhelical shear - current dynamo .",
    "indeed , the large - scale velocity shear creates anisotropy of turbulence that produces a contribution to the electromotive force , @xmath1 , caused by the shear , where @xmath2 is the background large - scale vorticity due to the shear and @xmath3 is the large - scale electric current .",
    "joint effects of the electromotive force @xmath1 and stretching of the mean magnetic field due to the large - scale shear motions cause the mean - field dynamo instability .",
    "note also that the numerical experiment with taylor - green forcing @xcite seems to be another example of a mean - field dynamo produced by a combined effect of a nonhelical turbulence and a complicated large - scale flow .",
    "other effect that might explain the nonhelical large - scale dynamo is related to kinetic helicity fluctuations in a sheared turbulence .",
    "a problem associated with dynamics of large - scale magnetic field in the presence of kinetic helicity fluctuations in a shear - free turbulence has been formulated for the first time by kraichnan @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", he assumed that in small scales @xmath4 ( and @xmath5 there is a small - scale turbulence generated by forcing @xmath6 . on the other hand , in the scales @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 )",
    "there are kinetic helicity fluctuations ( or @xmath9 fluctuations ) with a zero mean generated by forcing @xmath10 .",
    "the mean - field effects occur at large scales @xmath11 ( and times @xmath12 ) , where the large - scale helicity is zero .",
    "the large - scale quantities are determined by double averaging over velocity fluctuations and over kinetic helicity fluctuations .",
    "it was found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that kinetic helicity fluctuations in a shear - free turbulence cause both , a reduction of turbulent magnetic diffusion and a large - scale drift velocity , @xmath13 , of the mean magnetic field .    in recent time",
    "the dynamo problem related to kinetic helicity fluctuations has been extensively studied . in particular ,",
    "various mathematical aspects of this problem has been discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "some numerical experiments which examine effects of kinetic helicity fluctuations have been performed in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "numerical simulations of the magnetic field evolution in accretion discs in @xcite have demonstrated that kinetic helicity fluctuations with a zero mean can result in generation of large - scale magnetic field .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that inhomogeneous kinetic helicity fluctuations in a sheared turbulence can produce a mean - field dynamo . in particular",
    ", a joint action of a large - scale shear and a nonzero mean alpha effect caused by the inhomogeneous kinetic helicity fluctuations can result in generation of a large - scale magnetic field , where the mean alpha effect in a sheared turbulence is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this mean - field dynamo is similar to the @xmath15-dynamo . on the other hand",
    ", it has been suggested in @xcite using phenomenological arguments that homogeneous kinetic helicity fluctuations in a homogeneous turbulence with shear may generate a large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the main goal of this study is to examine a possibility for a nonhelical large - scale dynamo associated with homogeneous kinetic helicity fluctuations with a zero mean in a homogeneous turbulence with a large - scale shear . in a study of a sheared turbulence we use two different approaches",
    ", namely , the spectral tau - approximation @xcite and second order correlation approximation ( soca , sometimes refers in astrophysical literature as first - order smoothing approximation ( fosa ) , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
