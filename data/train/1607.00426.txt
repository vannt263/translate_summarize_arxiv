    "the present paper studies the representation theory of the category of injections between finite sets .",

    "the representation theory of the category of injections between finite sets has been studied in papers @xcite and @xcite by church , ellenberg , farb and ( in the second paper ) nagpal , where the authors exhibit several examples of how modules over this category arise in applications .",
    "the gabriel quiver ( without relations ) of the linearized category @xmath7 was described already by brimacombe @xcite , and later in the much more general setting of rectangular monoids by margolis and steinberg @xcite .",
    "their approach was used by stein in @xcite to describe the gabriel quiver of the category of surjections between finite sets as well as related categories .    originating with papers such as @xcite of priddy and @xcite of beilinson , ginzburg and soergel ,",

    "after publication of the original version of the manuscript on arxiv , it was brought to the author s attention that the main results appear ( somewhat in disguise ) in @xcite , where they are formulated in a different setup and proved by different methods .      for our first main result ,",
    "we show in theorem [ quiverthm ] of section [ s2 ] that the quiver @xmath10 of the linearized category @xmath7 is the young lattice modulo the relations that 2 nodes added to the same column yields 0 . for our second main result ,",
    "we in theorem [ selfdualthm ] of section [ s3 ] show that @xmath11 is quadratic self - dual .",
