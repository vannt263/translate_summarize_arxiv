    "the vast majority of the properties of everyday molecular and solid state systems can be predicted from the solution of the non - relativistic , time - independent electronic schrdinger equation .",
    "static properties , which depend only on the ground state solution , cover important experimental quantities such as ionization potentials or atomization energies , required for heats of formation .",
    "however , the complexity of the fully coupled equations results in its exact solution being out of reach for all but the smallest systems to date .",
    "the full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo ( fciqmc ) method@xcite , is a diagonalization - free , non - perturbative approach which projects a stochastic sampling of the wavefunction towards the exact ground state solution of the schrdinger equation within a given orbital basis ( obs ) .",
    "this is achieved via a stochastic propagation of a population of walkers within the full space of slater determinants .",
    "the dynamics are devised such that the long - time average over the discrete walker population on any determinant approaches that of the fci coefficient . for several",
    "systems@xcite it has been shown that the fciqmc method is capable of providing the exact fci energies within systematically improvable errorbars of @xmath2e_h$ ] , with only a fraction of the computational costs of an equivalent fci calculation .",
    "thus this method can be applied to tackle difficult systems that require an accurate and non - perturbative description of the correlation . in the past ,",
    "the fciqmc method has be employed to calculate the energies of a diverse range of systems , including atoms and molecules@xcite , the hubbard model@xcite , the uniform electron gas@xcite , and solid state systems@xcite . since its first implementation , the efficiency and abilities of the fciqmc method have been steadily improved .",
    "the initiator approximation@xcite , real walkers , and semi - stochastic sampling@xcite have decreased the computational effort of the method considerably , and new functionalities include the calculation of excited states@xcite , the calculation of accurate two - particle reduced density matrices using a replica sampling technique@xcite , and the use of these density matrices within a complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) approach@xcite . while an fciqmc calculation is generally far less computational expensive than a conventional fci calculation , fciqmc calculations are still limited to relatively small orbital basis sets , because the number of slater determinants scales binomially with their size .",
    "this results in basis set incompleteness error ( bsie ) in computed energies and properties , compounded by the fact that this error decreases slowly with respect to increasing basis set size@xcite . the origin of this error is the result of the inability of slater determinants to model the electron - electron cusps in the wavefunction@xcite .",
    "as described by kato s cusp condition@xcite , the cusp regions are defined where the inter - electronic distance @xmath3 goes to zero . away from this point ,",
    "the wavefunction depends linearly on @xmath4 .",
    "such behaviour is very difficult to obtain from a superposition of smooth slater determinants which are built from one - electron functions that are centred at the nuclei .",
    "thus very large basis sets are required to provide the flexibility for an accurate description of these cusp regions .",
    "an alternative to extrapolating this basis set incompleteness through often expensive calculations in large basis sets is given by explicitly correlated methods@xcite , which can reduce the bsie efficiently with often little additional cost compared to the original calculation .",
    "the general aim of these approaches is to augment the ansatz for the wavefunction with explicitly correlated geminals which contain terms that are linear in the inter - electronic distance @xmath4 at the cusp positions .",
    "solutions for a large number of technical challenges from the inclusion of these geminals have been addressed in the literature over the last few decades@xcite .",
    "these most notably include the avoidance of up to four - electron integrals , which have been addressed with efficient resolution of the identity techniques , and an optimized slater - type geminal form , which provides a more efficient description of the wider correlation hole about each cusp position@xcite .",
    "this work has led to modern ` f12 ' methods which are reliable , efficient and robust .    whilst earlier efforts focused on the combination of f12 methodology with single - reference quantum chemical techniques ,",
    "there has been increasing emphasis on adapting the technology for use with multi - reference methods , including multireference configuration interaction@xcite and multireference perturbation theories@xcite , within an consistent , internally contracted framework .",
    "this has been an important advance , since even though multireference methods are required in the presence of stronger , static correlations in low - spin open - shell or transition state systems for example , these correlations are present _ in addition _ to the cusp - dominated dynamic correlation required for quantitative accuracy .",
    "these already challenging systems therefore also inherit all of the same slow basis set convergence problems of single reference systems .",
    "this is further exacerbated by the generally far higher cost with respect to basis set size for these systems , and therefore their combination with explicitly correlated techniques is a significant improvement .",
    "however , a drawback of many of the multireference approaches to date is that they are tailored and embedded within each parent multireference method , and therefore new equations have to be derived and code implemented , for each new multireference method .",
    "this issue is rectified by the introduction two ` universal ' explicitly correlated multireference techniques as the topic of the current study , which can be simply applied to almost all electronic structure methods .",
    "their combination with the fciqmc method provides a powerful approach to multireference quantum chemistry , and their overall accuracy , as well as suitability for use with fciqmc will be assessed .",
    "these approaches are the @xmath0_{r12}$ ] method of torheyden , kong and valeev@xcite , which is briefly described in section  [ sec : r12 ] , and the canonically transcorrelated approach of yanai _",
    "et al._@xcite , described in section  [ sec : ct_theory ] .",
    "these provide contrasting approaches to the challenge of a universal multireference f12 method , with the former providing an internally contracted , perturbative coupling of the geminals to a given multireference wavefunction , while the latter uses an initial guess density in order to transcorrelate the hamiltionian , effectively removing the cusp features from its solution , prior to the multireference treatment .",
    "these approaches differ substantially in the way that the geminals are coupled to the multireference wavefunction , and in whether the multireference wavefunction can relax due to their presence , with the former adhering to a more traditional ` diagonalize - then - perturb ' approach , while the latter is constructed on a ` perturb - then - diagonalize ' philosophy .",
    "whilst the infinite basis limit is exact for both approaches , away from this limit , they are not expected to behave the same .",
    "previous applications of these approaches to fciqmc have been shown to improve the results significantly via the reduction in bsie , however these studies were limited to very few systems and did not allow for a direct comparison between the two different methods@xcite . in this paper , the two explicitly correlated fciqmc approaches are assessed in an in - depth study using the 55 molecules of the g1 standard set@xcite , and by using this large sample size it is possible to draw more general conclusions about the success and efficiency of both methods .",
    "in the full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo ( fciqmc ) method , the wave function @xmath5 is expanded in a basis set of all @xmath6-electron slater determinants @xmath7 , @xmath8 the coefficients @xmath9 are coarse - grained and stochastically sampled using a population of walkers , where each walker is defined by its sign , weight , and the slater determinant it is associated with .",
    "the walkers then evolve according to a set of coupled differential equations derived from the imaginary time schrdinger equation , such that the long - time average of the signed weight of walkers @xmath10 on a slater determinant @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath9 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the matrix elements of the hamiltonian operator , @xmath14 an energy offset , and @xmath15 a small interval in imaginary time .    following equation ( [ fciqmc_walker ] ) ,",

    "the sign of the newly spawned walkers on a determinant @xmath23 is the same as parent determinant if @xmath24 and opposite otherwise , and their weight is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the probability of choosing the determinant @xmath23 .",

    "walkers that are assigned to the same determinant but have an opposite sign annihilate each other , so that all walkers on each occupied determinant have the same sign at the end of each iteration .    a typical fciqmc calculation starts with one walker on the hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) determinant and a fixed energy offset @xmath29 . due to",
    "the fact that the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian must be below @xmath30 , the population of walkers grows exponentially until a specified number of walkers is reached .",
    "then @xmath14 is varied smoothly , so that the walker population becomes approximately constant .",
    "the ground state energy can be determined from the long - time average of the energy offset @xmath14 and from the long - time average of the projected energy : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes an imaginary - time average , and @xmath33 denotes the weight of walkers on the reference wavefunction .",
    "often this is taken to be the largest weighted single slater determinant , but can also be an arbitrary linear combination of slater determinants@xcite . once the wavefunction has converged , and is sampling the desired solution , it is also possible to accumulate the two - body reduced density matrix , which is sampled at the same time as the spawning steps above . as this is a non - linear function of a random variable ( the sampled wavefunction ) , serious systematic errors can result in this sampling .",
    "this issue is remedied via the introduction of a second ` replica ' sampling of the wavefunction , which samples randomly from the same distribution of the ground state wavefunction , but is uncorrelated to the first .",
    "this allows for an unbiased sampling of the reduced density matrices from which many properties of the wavefunction derive .",
    "whilst the sampling of the density matrices is now unbiased , there are computational overheads with its computation .",
    "the sampling of the second replica approximately doubles the computational overhead , both in terms of memory and processor time , while additional ( non - distributed ) memory is required to store the full two - body density matrix ( currently in non - sparse form ) .",

    "along with incompleteness in the description of two - electron part of the wavefunction , there is also a basis set incompleteness in the one - electron description of the wavefunction@xcite , which is excluded from the construction of these universal f12 corrections . while the presence of strong correlations can change the magnitude of this one - electron incompleteness ,",
    "it is generally much smaller than the two - electron incompleteness , and so we assume here that it is well represented by the incompleteness in the uncorrelated hartree  fock energy . to estimate the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit of this one - electron energy , we extrapolated the hf energies to the cbs limit with an exponential dependence@xcite , as @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the cardinal number of the basis set and calculations in aug - cc - pvtz , aug - cc - pvqz , and aug - cc - pv5z basis sets were used .",

    "the molecules of the g1 standard set have a generally single - reference character so that ccsd(t ) calculations are capable of achieving high accuracy results .",
    "it is likely then that these results will be fairer comparison than experimentally derived results for the total energy , due to uncertainties in the experimental procedure for this quantity .",
    "hence , the assumed exact energies in the cbs limit that we used as a benchmark were obtained from ccsd(t)-f12b calculations in aug - cc - pv5z basis sets performed with ` molpro`@xcite , which we then further correct for static correlation effects .",
    "the static correlation corrections for the different molecules were approximated with the individual error of a ccsd(t ) calculation in an aug - cc - pvdz basis set compared to the near - exact fciqmc result in the same basis set .",
    "since the majority of the static component of correlation can be captured in a small orbital space ( hence the success of the casscf - derived approaches to strongly correlated systems ) , it is reasonable to assume that this correction will account for most of the deficiencies in the ccsd(t ) results .",
    "as expected , the static corrections are small for those single - reference systems : the absolute mean error is 0.1  @xmath64 per correlated electron , and the maximum absolute total error of 3.0  @xmath64 ( 0.4  @xmath64 per correlated electron ) was found for the si@xmath65 molecule .    in fig .",

    "it can be seen that both explicitly correlated methods reduce the absolute error per correlated electron significantly for all molecules .",
    "the effect of the correction is stronger for the systems that show a larger bsie , such as so@xmath65 and f@xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , for nearly all molecules , the ct - fciqmc method achieves slightly lower errors than the fciqmc - r12 method . on average ,",

    "thus , the fciqmc - r12 and the fciqmc - ct methods are capable of producing relatively accurate atomization energies in aug - cc - pvdz basis sets ( though not quite chemical accuracy ) , with far greater reliability than without the explicit correlation , indicated by the smaller spread and median in the results .",

    "this has the advantage that the multireference wavefunction capturing the static correlation in the system can relax in the presence of the geminal amplitudes and dynamic correlation contributions .",
    "furthermore , we showed that the transcorrelation reduces the computational effort of the fciqmc calculation as it improves the convergence of the initiator error with respect to the total number of walkers .",
    "the ct method is also in principle a state - universal approach , in that the specifics of the high - energy geminal contributions to the effective hamiltonian should be relatively insensitive to the state or specifics of the choice of geminal .",

    "<S> the full configuration interaction quantum monte carlo ( fciqmc ) method has proved able to provide near - exact solutions to the electronic schrdinger equation within a finite orbital basis set , without relying on an expansion about a reference state . however </S>",
    "<S> , a drawback to the approach is that being based on an expansion of slater determinants , the fciqmc method suffers from a basis set incompleteness error that decays very slowly with the size of the employed single particle basis . </S>",
    "<S> the fciqmc results obtained in a small basis set can be improved significantly with explicitly correlated techniques . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a study that assesses and compares two contrasting ` universal ' explicitly correlated approaches that fit into the fciqmc framework ; the @xmath0_{r12}$ ] method of valeev _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , and the explicitly correlated canonical transcorrelation approach of yanai _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. the former is an _ a posteriori _ internally - contracted perturbative approach , while the latter transforms the hamiltonian prior to the fciqmc simulation . </S>",
    "<S> these comparisons are made across the 55 molecules of the g1 standard set . </S>",
    "<S> we found that both methods consistently reduce the basis set incompleteness , for accurate atomization energies in small basis sets , reducing the error from 28  me@xmath1 to 3 - 4  me@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> while many of the conclusions hold in general for any combination of multireference approaches with these methodologies , we also consider fciqmc - specific advantages of each approach . </S>"
