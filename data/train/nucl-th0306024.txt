    "photon induced reactions on nuclei provide a promising tool for the investigation of in - medium properties of hadrons . however , the interpretation of data is often difficult , because it is hard to disentangle contributions from different resonances and/or different decay channels as e.g. in the case of pion production in the second resonance region . in this respect",
    "the study of the @xmath0 is very interesting because of its strong coupling to @xmath1 . in the energy regime of @xmath2 mev",
    "this channel is strongly dominated by the @xmath0 and therefore @xmath3 photoproduction gives information almost solely about this resonance .    in the past ,",
    "different experiments of @xmath3 photoproduction on several nuclei ( c , al , ca , cu , nb , pb ) were performed .",
    "the taps group covered the energy range from threshold up to photo energies of 800 mev @xcite , whereas measurements at kek @xcite provided data up to 1 gev . other theoretical approaches to the process discussed several in - medium effects . in @xcite a qmd model was applied .",
    "besides the trivial effects of fermi motion and pauli blocking , the authors found a strong influence due to collisional reactions of the @xmath4 .",
    "the authors of @xcite were able to describe the kek data on carbon under the assumption that both scalar and vector potential of the @xmath4 vanish .",
    "however , the calculations were performed in nuclear matter and the @xmath3 final state interactions were modelled by using a constant absorption factor .",
    "hence , the findings of this work have to be checked by a more realistic model .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate @xmath3 photoproduction on different nuclei using a semi - classical buu transport model , which was already successfully applied to the calculation of a variety of reactions ( e.g. heavy - ion reactions @xcite , photon- and electron - induced reactions @xcite ) . within this model ,",
    "@xmath3 photoproduction for energies up to 800 mev was already addressed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we now want to extend our study to higher energies covered by the kek data and to discuss medium modifications of the @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath4 in - medium width is obtained from self - consistent resonance - hole calculations @xcite .",
    "we start with a brief review of the buu model and the implementation of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 dynamics in sec . [",
    "sec : buu_model ] followed by a discussion of in - medium modifications of the @xmath4 width in sec .",
    "[ sec : inmed_width ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we show our results in comparison with experimental data .",
    "for the present studies , we use the buu model reported in @xcite .",
    "the model is based upon a system of coupled buu equations describing the evolution of the spectral distribution function @xmath5 with the phase space density @xmath6 of different particle types @xmath7 : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the spectral function and @xmath10 is a relativistic hamilton function @xmath11 with a scalar potential @xmath12 described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 stand for the collision rates of particle species @xmath14 and describe the gain and the loss of the distribution function at some point @xmath15 due to collisional reactions with particles of the same and other types .",
    "therefore , the buu equations are coupled via their right - hand sides .",
    "the set of equations is solved by a test particle ansatz for each density function @xmath16 . for model details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "besides the nucleon , our model contains 29 nucleon resonances with parameters taken from the analysis of manley and saleski @xcite and all relevant mesonic degrees of freedom ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 couples to the resonances @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with pole - mass branching ratios of 0.43 , 0.03 and 0.94 .",
    "the single - particle energy of a nucleon in the local rest frame ( lrf ) of the surrounding nuclear matter is given by @xmath20 with vector and scalar potentials @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for the nucleon , in the lrf the spatial components of the vector potential vanish in the mean - field approximation . in the non - relativistic limit",
    ", @xmath23 corresponds to the difference of scalar and vector potential .",
    "for @xmath23 we use the density and momentum dependent non - relativistic mean - field parametrization from welke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite @xmath24 in this equation @xmath25 is the local fermi momentum .",
    "we can work with a choice of parameter sets @xmath26 determining the momentum dependence and stiffness of the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : potpar ] ) . here , we use either a momentum independent hard eos ( h ) or a momentum dependent medium eos ( m ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] we show the momentum dependence of the potential @xmath23 for the parameter set ( m ) for different densities .",
    "@xmath23 is transformed in the lrf into a scalar potential @xmath12 using @xmath27    we assume that the potential @xmath23 for the @xmath0 is also given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential2 ] ) , and the scalar resonance potential @xmath28 is obtained in the same way .",
    "the effective resonance mass is then given by @xmath29 since no detailed calculations exist for the @xmath4 , this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "the main source of @xmath3 mesons is the elementary @xmath30 reaction .",
    "it is known that in the threshold region the process @xmath31 is well described by the excitation of the @xmath4 resonance ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution coming from the two other resonances coupling to @xmath1 are neglected , because the @xmath32 branching ratio of the @xmath18 is very small and the @xmath19 is beyond the considered energy range .",
    "therefore , we use the following breit - wigner parametrization : @xmath33 with @xmath34 @xcite and the pole - mass decay width @xmath35 gev . the center of mass ( cm ) momentum @xmath36 of the @xmath37 pair depends on the cm energy @xmath38 ( i.e. mass of the resonance ) , @xmath39 is the cm momentum taken at the pole mass of the @xmath4 .",
    "the other ( mass dependent ) resonance widths @xmath40 and @xmath41 are parametrized as in @xcite . for the photocoupling helicity amplitude",
    "we use @xmath42 gev@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the reaction @xmath44 is obtained from ( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) by @xmath45 as suggested in @xcite , corresponding to @xmath46 gev@xmath43 .",
    "this value results from a resonance fit to eta photoproduction data on the deuteron and is connected to the value for @xmath47 found in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not use the ( smaller ) values found in other analyses ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_nucleon ] we show the cross section for the elementary process @xmath48 in comparison with the data sets from @xcite . for energies up to @xmath49 gev",
    "the agreement with the data is good .",
    "our model also contains other channels for the elementary @xmath30 interaction , namely @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "these processes might also contribute to @xmath3 photoproduction on nuclei via final state interactions ( e.g. the reaction chain @xmath50 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that they are rather small .",
    "the parametrization of these processes via resonance fits to experimental pion photoproduction data is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) and described in ref . @xcite .      the @xmath3 final state interactions ( fsi ) are assumed to be mediated by the re - excitation of resonances . in the energy range under consideration the @xmath0 clearly dominates .",
    "the cross sections for elastic and inelastic @xmath32 reactions therefore are similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) and strongly depend on the energy of the @xmath3 : @xmath56 with the @xmath32 cm momentum @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 contains the decay channels @xmath59 , @xmath1 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . among these ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath1 are the relevant channels ( branching ratio @xmath63 ) . in the medium , the @xmath4 also undergoes fsi via the processes @xmath64 which give rise to a finite collision width .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : inmed_width ] .",
    "of course , the absorption of @xmath4 states in such reactions also contributes to the absorption of @xmath3 mesons .",
    "finally , the coupled - channel treatment of our buu model also allows for contributions from side - feeding reactions such as @xmath65 . as already mentioned , the @xmath3 mesons managing to escape the nucleus stem to a large extent from the elementary reaction chain @xmath66 .",
    "in @xcite the collisional broadening of the resonances @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath0 and @xmath54 was calculated from the collision rates resulting from processes like ( [ eq : s11_fsi ] ) : @xmath68 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is the phase space density of the incoming nucleons , @xmath73 are the pauli blocking factors for the outgoing particles included in the final state @xmath58 .",
    "note that such collision rates also appear in the collision integrals on the right - hand side of the buu equations .",
    "therefore , consistency between the collision widths and the processes explicitly included in the transport model is guaranteed .",
    "the matrix elements appearing in the collision rates are identical to those contained in the cross sections for the processes ( [ eq : s11_fsi ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : collrate ] ) can be rearranged in the following way : @xmath74 where the averaging is performed over the momentum distribution of the incoming nucleon and @xmath75 is the relative velocity of the incoming @xmath70 pair in the cm frame .",
    "we see that this expression is similar to what one obtains from the low density theorem @xmath76 , leading to an increase of the collision rates with momentum @xmath77 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gcoll ] .",
    "this way , for an on - shell resonance a broadening of about @xmath78 mev at @xmath79 was found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known from various calculations @xcite , that the applicability of the low density theorem may be restricted to a regime of rather small densities . in order to overcome this problem",
    "we have developed a coupled channel analysis of the properties of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath3 mesons as well as baryon resonances in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the resonance parameters are taken from the analysis of manley _",
    "the in - medium propagators of the mesons are determined from the excitation of nucleon - hole and resonance - hole loops .",
    "the resonance self energy in nuclear matter @xmath82 is obtained by replacing the vacuum meson propagator with the in - medium one in the meson nucleon loops , see fig .",
    "[ fig : selfen ] . of course ,",
    "also the correction from pauli blocking is included .",
    "the collisional broadening is given by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the pauli - blocked vacuum width . by coupling the meson and resonance properties a self - consistency problem arises , which we solve iteratively .",
    "the physical interpretation is that higher iterations involve reactions on more than one nucleon .",
    "for example , going to the next order effectively takes into account 3-body processes of the resonances .",
    "this is clearly beyond the low density theorem .    concerning the properties of the @xmath4 resonance",
    ", we find a net broadening of @xmath78 mev at @xmath79 for an on - shell resonance .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gcoll ] , in the momentum range of interest between 0.6 and 1 gev this result is in absolute size ( relative to the total width at @xmath79 ) close to that of @xcite .",
    "effects from the dressing of @xmath80 and @xmath3 mesons are of the order of a few mev , the only sizeable contribution to the collisional broadening coming from the @xmath60 sector ( for details we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the calculation of @xcite , where a somewhat larger value for the broadening was predicted . the strong in - medium",
    "correction in the @xmath60 channel is due to the coupling of the @xmath53 state to the @xmath81 meson , which moves spectral strength down to smaller invariant masses @xcite in the @xmath81 mass distribution .",
    "this way , the phase space available for the decay of a @xmath0 is enhanced .",
    "the slightly different momentum behavior of the collision widths ( [ eq : coll - width ] ) compared to the collision rates ( [ eq : collrate ] ) is due to the resummation of particle - hole loops in the meson propagators .",
    "this leads to a decrease of the @xmath1 contribution and an increase of the @xmath60 contribution with increasing @xmath77 , leaving the total width @xmath85 nearly constant .",
    "this behavior , however , can not be extrapolated to very small momenta @xmath86 gev due to effects from pauli blocking in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "we find that the main effect from the inclusion of higher order effects is a slight reduction of the broadening in the @xmath60 channel .",
    "this is due to the strong broadening of the @xmath53 which leads to a moderate reduction of this state in the @xmath81 spectral function .",
    "therefore , some @xmath81 spectral strength is moved up to larger invariant masses , and the decay of a @xmath4 to the @xmath87 channel is somewhat suppressed .",
    "we have also calculated the mass shift corresponding to the broadening of the @xmath4 by means of a dispersion analysis @xcite . as a result",
    "we do not observe any significant shift .",
    "this , of course , supports the hypothesis , that the mass shift as observed in the photo - nucleus data , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_nucleus ] , is due to binding effects , see section [ sec : results ] . in the actual calculation",
    ", we therefore do not include the dispersive mass shift .",
    "the influence of the medium on the @xmath4 enters the calculations in two different ways : the reactions displayed in ( [ eq : s11_fsi ] ) , which are directly connected with a collision rate via eq .",
    "( [ eq : collrate ] ) , are implemented explicitly in the model . due to the fact that the results for the collisional width ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : coll - width ] ) ) are close to the collision rates , the consistency between the widths and these explicit processes is maintained .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath4 final states are not restricted to the vacuum decay channels , the width @xmath40 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) and ( [ eq : eta_fsi ] ) has to be substituted by the full in - medium width .",
    "in fig . [ fig : gamma_nucleus ] we show our results for the reaction @xmath88 for different nuclei in comparison with the taps and kek data .",
    "the latter are obtained by integration over @xmath89 , while the former data as well as our calculations cover the full angular range .",
    "however , the main contribution stems from angles smaller than @xmath90 . imposing this limitation on our calculations ,",
    "deviations smaller than 3% are found .",
    "the dashed and solid curves in each plot correspond to the two potentials ( h ) and ( m ) described in sec .",
    "[ sec : buu_model ] .",
    "the calculations include fermi motion , pauli blocking , nuclear binding effects and fsi , but @xmath4 vacuum widths are used in the cross sections ( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) and ( [ eq : eta_fsi ] ) .",
    "the dotted curves do involve the full @xmath4 in - medium width in the cross sections and therefore show the total influence of collisional broadening .    the curves ( m )",
    "are shifted by about 50 - 70 mev compared to the curves ( h ) .",
    "this can be understood by taking a look at the elementary reaction @xmath91 .",
    "the momentum independent potential ( h ) is identical both for incoming nucleon and outgoing resonance .",
    "the resonance mass is obtained from the cm energy @xmath38 ( i.e. effective resonance mass ) by subtracting the resonance potential : @xmath92 in the case of the momentum dependent potential ( m ) we obtain a different result . for photon energies of about 800 mev",
    "the outgoing resonance has also a momentum of about 800 mev . for such momentum values ,",
    "the potential ( m ) is almost zero , see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .",
    "therefore we get for the resonance mass @xmath93 , which is is smaller compared to @xmath94 : @xmath95 hence the peak maxima in both scenarios are shifted relatively to each other by roughly @xmath96 , which is approximately 50 - 70 mev .",
    "as one can see , the curves ( h ) overestimate the taps data in the threshold region and exhibit a maximum shifted towards lower energies with respect to the peak maximum suggested by the kek data .",
    "in contrast , the curves ( m ) only slightly underestimate the taps data , but are in very good agreement with the kek data , especially the location of the peak maximum is well reproduced .",
    "the influence of the collisional broadening of the @xmath4 has only little influence . as can be seen from the dotted curves , which visualize the effect of the medium modification via the cross sections ( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) and ( [ eq : eta_fsi ] ) . in order to completely analyze the influence of collisional broadening ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : carbon_coll ] four different szenarios : the dashed curve shows the calculation without any fsi .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve includes fsi except for the @xmath4 fsi in ( [ eq : s11_fsi ] ) and therefore shows the influence of the direct @xmath3 absorption via resonance re - excitation .",
    "both calculations use vacuum widths in the cross sections ( [ eq : gamma_proton ] ) and ( [ eq : eta_fsi ] ) .",
    "the solid curves include all fsi and corresponds to the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_nucleus ] .",
    "the dotted curve also includes the full in - medium widths in the cross sections and corresponds to the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_nucleus ] .",
    "it is seen that the main effect comes from the direct @xmath3 absorption via @xmath97 , whereas the influence of in - medium effects concerning the @xmath4 is rather small .",
    "this is not surprising , because the mean free path @xmath98 of a @xmath4 at @xmath79 is about 3 fm  compared to @xmath99 fm for the @xmath3  whereas the rms radius of c is about 2.5 fm .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of yorita _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who find a strong effect from the @xmath4 fsi .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca_fsi ] we show the effect of the fsi in the case of calcium .",
    "the solid line includes fsi .",
    "the dotted curve is the result without fsi divided my a constant factor of 1.9 . in both calculations we used the potential ( m ) and neglected the medium modification of the @xmath4 widths .",
    "it is clearly visible that the absorption depends on energy and therefore the assumption of a constant absorption factor made in @xcite is unrealistic .",
    "this result also holds for other nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the issues raised in @xcite concerning the peak position can be verified .",
    "the claim there was that the peak position can only be described by assuming vanishing scalar and vector potentials for the @xmath0 .",
    "this scenario is close to what we get with the momentum dependent potential ( m ) for the @xmath4 , which  as mentioned above  nearly vanishes in the kinematical regime under investigation .",
    "we have calculated @xmath3 photoproduction on several nuclei in the energy region dominated by the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "starting from a parametrization of the data for the elementary @xmath100 reaction , we applied a buu transport model to account for final state interactions .",
    "the calculations including a momentum dependent potential for the nucleons and the @xmath4 reproduce the available data well . in the threshold region",
    "a slight underestimation of the data is observed .",
    "the calculations involving a momentum independent potential cleary overestimate the data .    the collisional width of the @xmath4 , calculated within a realistic self - consistent resonance - hole model @xcite , was found to be close to the collision rates from @xcite and was included in the transport calculations .",
    "the influence of collisional reactions of the @xmath4 on the cross section were found to be small , in contrast to the qmd calculations of yorita _ et al .",
    "the main difference between the result without fsi and the full calculation can be attributed to the absorption of the @xmath3 in the fsi e.g. via @xmath101 .",
    "finally , we have shown that the absorption reactions can not be mimicked by applying a constant factor to the results without fsi .",
