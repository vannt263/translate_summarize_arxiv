    "although the form was different , the content of his argument is captured by the following statement :     if the perturbative series were to converge to the exact result , the function being expanded would be analytic in @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "but the function ( z for example ) is not analytic in @xmath6 at that value .",
    "therefore , as a function of @xmath6 , the perturbative series is either divergent or converges to the wrong answer . \"",
    "estimations of the large order behavior of the coefficients of the perturbative series showed that the first possibility is the one actually realized @xcite . that z , as a function of @xmath6 , is not analytic at @xmath7 , can be guessed by simply noting that if in its functional integral representation ( eq .  ( [ eq : partfunc ] ) )",
    "we make the real part of @xmath6 negative , the integral diverges .",
    "in fact , there is a branch cut in the first riemann sheet that can be chosen to lie along the negative real axis , extending from @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the above argument is very powerful and extends to the perturbative series of almost all other nontrivial field theories .",
    "it has also motivated a series of very important calculations of the large order behavior of the perturbative coefficients @xcite , general analysis on the structure of field theories @xcite , as well as improvements over perturbative computations of different physical quantities @xcite .    for all its power , it is fair to say that the argument , as almost any other _ reductio ad absurdum _ type of argument , fails to point towards a solution of the problem of divergence .",
    "it is only through the indirect formalism of borel transforms that questions of recovery of the full theory from its perturbative series can be discussed @xcite .    in this paper an alternative way of understanding the divergent nature of the perturbative series is presented .",
    "this way of understanding the problem complements the traditional argument briefly described above , hopefully illuminating aspects that the traditional approach leaves obscure .",
    "in particular , as we will see , the arguments in this paper point directly towards the aspects of the perturbative series that need to be modified to achieve a convergent series .",
    "it is hoped that the way of understanding the problem presented here will help to provide new insights into the urgent problem of extracting non - perturbative information out of quantum field theories .    in section  [ sec : leb ] we develop our analysis of the divergence of perturbation theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : converg ] we point out the ingredients that , according to the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : leb ] , a modification of perturbation theory would need to achieve convergence .",
    "we also present a remarkable formula  ( [ win ] ) that allows us to implement such modifications in terms of gaussian integrals , paving the way to the application of this convergent modified perturbative series to quantum field theories .",
    "the proof of the properties of the function  ( [ win ] ) is done in appendix 1 . in section  [ improvement ] we analyze recent work on the convergence of various optimized expansions  [ 12 - 19 ] in terms of the ideas presented here . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize our results and mention directions of the work currently in preparation .",
    "finally , in appendix 2 , we apply the ideas of this paper in a simple but illuminating example for which we actually develop a convergent series by modifying the aspects of the perturbative series pointed out by our analysis as the source of divergence .",
    "although the notation will not always be explicit , we work in an euclidean space of dimension smaller than 4 and in a finite volume .",
    "let s remember how the perturbative series is generated in the functional integral formalism for a quantity like @xmath5 : @xmath10 e^{- \\int    { \\rm d^d } x   \\left [ { 1 \\over 2 }   \\left ( \\partial_{\\mu } \\phi \\right)^2 + { 1 \\over 2 }   m^2 \\phi^2   \\right ]   -   { \\lambda \\over 4 }   \\int    { \\rm d^d } x \\phi^4 }   \\\\ \\label{eq : first } & = &   \\int   \\left [ { \\rm d }",

    "the functional integrals that give the contribution of every order @xmath12 are calculated using wick s theorem and feynman s diagram techniques with the corresponding renormalization .",
    "we see then that the generation of the perturbative series in the functional integral formalism is a two step process .",
    "first ( [ eq : first ] ) the integrand is expanded in powers of the coupling constant , and then ( [ eq : second ] ) the sum is interchanged with the integral or any functional inside the functional integration symbol .",
    "it would be more precise to preserve this word for @xmath13 in the measure defined by the free field .",
    "the terminology used here is , however , common practice in the quantum field theory literature and also helps to emphasize the similarities with the intuitive finite dimensional case presented below . ]",
    "it will be convenient to have a simpler example in which the arguments of this paper become very transparent .",
    "consider the simple integral @xmath14 and its corresponding perturbative expansion @xmath15 this simple integral has been used many times in the past as a paradigmatic example of the divergence of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is then specially suited for a comparison between the traditional arguments and the ones presented in this paper .",
    "again we see the two step process to generate the perturbative series .",
    "first the integrand is expanded in powers of @xmath6  ( [ eq : pertsimple1 ] ) and then the sum is interchanged with the integral  ( [ eq : pertsimple2 ] ) . in this simple example",
    "the perturbative coefficients can be calculated exactly for arbitrary @xmath12 . in the large @xmath12 limit",
    "they become : @xmath16    with such factorial behavior , the series diverges for all @xmath17 different from zero as is well known . on the other hand the function @xmath18 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pertsimple ] ) , gives a well defined positive real number for every positive real @xmath6 .",
    "therefore one or both of the two steps done to generate the perturbative series must be wrong .    similarly , in the functional integral case",
    "normalized with respect to the free field ( [ eq : partfunc ] ) , @xmath5 is a well defined number while its perturbative series diverges .",
    "one or both of the two steps must be wrong .    the first step , the expansion of the integrand in powers of @xmath17 , is clearly correct . as the integrand ( not the integral ! ) is analytic in @xmath17 for every finite @xmath17 , the expansion merely corresponds to a taylor series .",
    "the second step , the interchange of sum and integral , must therefore be the wrong one .",
    "the next obvious step is then to recall the theorems that govern the interchange between sums and integrals , to understand in detail why this is wrong in our case .",
    "the most powerful theorem in this respect is the well known theorem of dominated convergence of lebesgue . in a simplified version ,",
    "enough for our purposes , it says the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ let @xmath19 be a sequence of integrable functions that converge pointwisely to a function @xmath20 @xmath21 and bounded in absolute value by a positive integrable function @xmath22 ( dominated ) @xmath23 then , it is true that @xmath24 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as a special case , if the convergence  ( [ eq : pointconv ] ) is uniform and the measure of integration is finite , then the interchange is also valid . it should be emphasized that lebesgue s theorem follows from the axioms of abstract measure theory . therefore if the problem under consideration involves a well defined measure , as is the case for the quantum field theories considered here  @xcite , the theorem holds .    in our case we can write formally , @xmath25=   { 1 \\over z_0 } \\sum_{n=0}^{n }    { \\left ( -1 \\right)^n \\over n ! }    \\left ( { \\lambda \\over 4 }    \\int    { \\rm d^d } x \\phi^4    \\right)^n   e^{- \\int    { \\rm d^d } x    \\left [ { 1 \\over 2 }   \\left ( \\partial_{\\mu }   \\phi \\right)^2 + { 1 \\over 2 }   m^2 \\phi^2   \\right ]    } \\ ] ] for the functional integral case , and @xmath26 for the simple integral example .",
    "one important aspect of the dominated convergence theorem approach to analyze the divergence of perturbation theory is that it focuses on the integrands , objects relatively simple to analyze . on the contrary ,",
    "the analyticity approach briefly described in the introduction focuses on the integrals , that are much more difficult to analyze .",
    "so , before we try to understand what aspects of the dominated convergence theorem fail in our case , let s see the  phenomena \" ( the integrand ) for the intuitive simple example .    to    in figure  [ fig1 ] , the exact integrand , together with some perturbative approximations , are displayed .",
    "we can appreciate the way in which the successive approximations behave . for small @xmath27 , and up to some critical value that we call @xmath28 , where the subindex @xmath29 stands for _ critical _ while the subindex @xmath11 indicates that this value changes with the order , the perturbative integrands approximate very well the exact integrand .",
    "even more , @xmath28 grows with @xmath11 .",
    "but for @xmath27 bigger that @xmath28 a `` bump '' begins to emerge .",
    "the height of these bumps , as we will see in detail shortly , grows factorially with the order , while the width remains approximately constant .",
    "so , the larger the order in perturbation theory , the larger the region in which the perturbative integrands approximate very well the exact integrand , but the stronger the upcoming deviation . as we will see shortly , it is precisely this deviation that is responsible for the divergence of the perturbative series and the famous factorial growth .",
    "we will also see that an exactly analogous phenomena happens in the functional integral case and is again the responsible for the divergence of the perturbative series",
    ".    returning to the problem of understanding the aspect of the dominated convergence theorem that fail in the perturbative series we will now show that the sequence of integrands of eq .",

    "to see the failure of the domination hypothesis it is convenient to analyze the  shape \" of every term of @xmath19 .",

    "the maxima of these bumps grows factorially with the order while their width remain approximately constant ( more specifically , the gaussian approximation around the maxima ( eq .  ( [ gaussapp ] ) ) , that becomes exact when the order goes to infinity , has a variance independent of the order ) . for fixed @xmath11 , and for @xmath27 smaller than a certain value ,",
    "the bumps delicately ",

    "however , for @xmath27 larger than that value , the last bump begins to emerge and , being the last , does not have the next one to get cancelled ( in the @xmath45 limit , there is no last bump and the convergence is achieved for every x ) . consequently , after a certain value @xmath28 , the function @xmath19 deviates strongly from @xmath20 and is governed by the uncanceled @xmath46 bump only , of height proportional to @xmath47 and finite variance .",
    "this is so because , since the height of the bump grows factorially with the order , for @xmath11 large enough the last bump is far greater than all the previous ones , so it remains almost completely uncanceled .",
    "since the variance of the bumps is independent of the order , this means that for every finite order , there is a region of _ finite measure _ in which the perturbative integrand is of the order of the height of the last bump . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we can see how the function @xmath48 is left almost completely uncanceled by @xmath34 and dominates the deviation of @xmath49 from @xmath20 .    that @xmath28 ( the value of @xmath50 up to which the perturbative integrand very accurately approximate the exact one ) grows with @xmath11 , going to infinity when @xmath45 , is a simple consequence of taylor s theorem applied to the analytic function @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath216 is a numerical constant .",
    "we are interested in understanding whether the corresponding convergence of the integrands is faster than passive . for our qualitative purposes ,",
    "it is enough to observe , in figure  [ fig4 ] , the convergence towards the exact integrand @xmath217 of both , the perturbative integrand @xmath218 and the optimized delta expansion integrand @xmath219 with @xmath220 , for @xmath221 .    to    we can see how accurate the convergence of @xmath222 is , already at this low order . in particular ,",
    "when the perturbative integrand begins to diverge , @xmath222 continues to approximate remarkably well the exact integrand . in the sub - figure",
    ", we can appreciate the difference between @xmath223 and @xmath222 .",
    "note the difference in the @xmath224 axis scale of graph and sub - graph .",
    "it is then clear that the optimized delta expansion method , with its subtle combination of passive and active components , manages to generate a sequence of integrands that ( uniformly ) converges towards the exact one at a rate that far exceeds the possibilities within a purely passive method .",
    "we stop here the qualitative discussion of the optimized delta expansion method expressing two general lessons :    1 .",
    "any method of improvement of the perturbative series in a given quantum theory , where a functional integral representation of the quantity under study exists , must rely , at the level of the integrands , on an improvement over the pointwise convergence of the taylor series in the coupling constants of @xmath225 .",
    "the problem of finding a convergent series reduces to the problem of finding a dominatedly convergent sequence of integrands towards @xmath225 .    this second simple statement , not only provides a guide to the construction of convergent schemes , but also emphasizes the fact that , in principle , a dominatedly convergent sequence of integrands , do not have to have any relation whatsoever with the corresponding taylor expansion",
    "in order to be able to use the usual techniques of quantum field theory , it is reasonable to restrict the search for a convergent scheme to a sequence of integrands of the general form : @xmath226 where the functional @xmath227 of the quadratic form @xmath228 , should take care of the non - dominated convergence that is bound to appear with only powers of the interacting action . the function @xmath168 of section  [ sec : converg ] , with its possible generalizations ,",
    "is an ideal candidate for this purpose .",
    "but the selection of the coefficients @xmath229 amounts to a pure problem in optimization of the convergence of the integrands @xmath230 no a priori connection with any taylor series is necessary .",
    "in this paper we have exposed the mechanism , at the level of the integrands , that make the perturbative expansion of a functional integral divergent .",
    "we have seen in detail how the sequence of integrands violate the domination hypothesis of the lebesgue s dominated convergent theorem .",
    "that theorem , as is well known , establishes the conditions under which it is allowed to interchange an integration and a limit , in particular the one that takes place in the generation of perturbation series .",
    "it was shown that at any finite order in perturbation theory , the field space divides into two regions .",
    "one , that grows with the order , in which the perturbative integrands very accurately approximate the exact integrand . in the other",
    "however , a strong deviation takes place .",
    "it was shown that the behavior in this second region violates the hypothesis of lebesgue s theorem , and , consequently , generates the divergence of perturbation theory .",
    "the famous factorial growth of the large order coefficients of the perturbative series was shown to be an effect , after integration , of the very mechanism that violates the hypothesis of the theorem .",
    "all of the above was done explicitly without relying in the particular analytic properties of the models studied .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that similar mechanisms of violation of the lebesgue s hypothesis are present in any other quantum field theory , although for just renormalizable theories other mechanisms are responsible for renormalons .",
    "studies in this direction are in progress .",
    "the mechanism of divergence presented here points towards a simple way to achieve a convergent series : integrate only in the  good \" region of field space . since this region grows with the order , becoming in the limit the whole field space , integrating in a correspondingly increasing region we would obtain a convergent series .",
    "a step forward towards a practical implementation of this program was made with the construction of the function @xmath168  ( [ win ] ) .",
    "this function allows us to introduce a gaussian representation of the characteristic function of regions of field space , very much like the imposition of constraints in the functional integral was allowed by a functional representation of the dirac s delta function .",
    "a rigorous proof of the convergence of this practical implementation of the above mentioned strategy is in progress . in appendix 2",
    "it was applied to a simple integral example .",
    "finally , a qualitative analysis of the optimized delta expansion method of improvement of perturbation theory in terms of the ideas of this paper was done .",
    "some general properties of improvement methods , useful to generates new schemes , as well as to understand and improve old ones , have been established .",

    "in this appendix we will prove the two properties of formula  ( [ win ] ) .",
    "because for @xmath203 all the terms of the sum defining @xmath152 are positive , we have trivially @xmath231 . on the other hand , since in the taylor expansion of @xmath232 all the terms are positive , we have @xmath233",

    "therefore @xmath246 in the region @xmath155 and property 1 is proved with an exponentially fast convergence .    in the region @xmath247 ,",
    "we have @xmath248 the first inequality is valid because @xmath249 and the second because + @xmath250 . the exponent is again negative . for @xmath249 ,",
    "both , @xmath251 and @xmath252 are positive , but now @xmath253 .",
    "so property 2 is also valid with an exponentially fast convergence .    for @xmath254 all we know",
    "is that @xmath168 is bounded by eq.([app : bound ] ) .",
    "that is all we need .",
    "numerics suggest @xmath255 when @xmath256 .",
    "this finishes our proof .",
    "in this appendix we apply the strategy discussed in section  [ sec : converg ] to generate a series convergent to the function @xmath178 ( eq .  ( [ eq : pertsimple ] ) ) .",

    "( [ win ] ) and computing _ exclusively _ gaussian integrals , therefore we restrict ourselves to using only those techniques that are also available in quantum field theory .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : converg ] , the simplest possible modification of the perturbative integrand ( [ eq : fnsimpltint ] ) that would transform the corresponding sequence into a dominated one , amounts to keep them as they are for @xmath257 and replacing them by zero for @xmath258 .",
    "that is , @xmath259 in fact , choosing @xmath28 so as to properly avoid the region in which the deviation takes place , the sequence of @xmath260 converges _ uniformly _ towards the exact integrand ( [ eq : exintd ] ) as we will show shortly . consequently , the corresponding sequence of integrals @xmath261 will converge to the desired integral @xmath262 in ( [ exint2 ] ) the change in the limits of integration from @xmath263 to @xmath264 is just due to the definition of @xmath260 in eq.([convseq ] ) .",
    "the interchange between sum and integral in ( [ exint3 ] ) is now allowed because in the region @xmath265 $ ] we have uniform convergence ( this is a stronger condition than dominated convergence ) .",
    "the resulting integrals are not gaussian due to the finite limits of integration .",
    "we will show how they can be calculated using only gaussian integrals .    a trivial way to achieve convergence of the sequence of integrals of the @xmath260 of eq .",
    "( [ convseq ] ) towards  ( [ desint ] ) amounts to keep @xmath28 equal to a finite constant @xmath266 independent of n , while taking the limit @xmath45 . in this limit , eq .",
    "( [ exint3 ] ) becomes identical to @xmath267 , since for finite @xmath268 the taylor series of the integrands converge uniformly .",
    "therefore , as already said , the interchange between sum and integral is legal . finally , taking the limit @xmath269",

    "applying taylor s theorem to the function @xmath279 one can easily show that the condition  ( [ diff ] ) is satisfied if @xmath280^{1/(4(n + 5/4))}.\\ ] ] note that the non - analytic dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath6 arises automatically from the imposition of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) to satisfy the hypothesis of the lebesgue s theorem .",
    "remember that the only condition on @xmath275 to achieve convergence of the sequence of integrals is to go to zero when @xmath45 consistently with @xmath273 in that limit .",
    "choosing for example @xmath281 we obtain asymptotically , @xmath282 this implies ( through eq .",

    "integration over the small field configurations only produces a convergent series . in the last column",
    "the improvement over the perturbative values can be appreciated.[table ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath284 .",
    "+ up to now we have proved that the general strategy of section  [ sec : converg ] does , in fact , generate a convergent sequence towards @xmath178",
    ". however , the resulting integrals in  ( [ exint3 ] ) are not gaussians , making the applicability of the method in quantum field theory dubious , to say the least .",
    "we will show now that the integrals of eq  ( [ exint3 ] ) can be computed , using eq .",
    "( [ win ] ) with @xmath176 , calculating only gaussian integrals .",

    "so it is clear that these two properties are enough to prove the validity of  ( [ calcnongaussint3 ] ) , where only gaussian integrals are present .",
    "but it is a good exercise to find a _",

    "we do this next .",

    "( [ calcnongaussint3 ] ) depends on the validity of the equation @xmath296 that this identity holds for every integer @xmath288 and @xmath295 can be seen by considering the following analytic function of the complex variable @xmath297 : @xmath298 if the identities ( [ identity ] ) hold , this function must be identically 1 , since for @xmath299 with @xmath169 integer it reduces to them , and for ever increasing @xmath169 , we obtain a sequence accumulating at @xmath300 on which the function should be 1 .",
    "conversely we will prove that @xmath301 is indeed identically 1 as an analytic function of @xmath297 , proving in consequence the identities ( [ identity ] ) for arbitrary @xmath288 and @xmath295 .",
    "consider the sequence @xmath302 for @xmath169 integer .",

    "this finishes the direct proof of eq .",
    "( [ calcnongaussint3 ] ) .    as was mentioned before , eq .",
    "( [ xcnasfunctn ] ) , that was derived independently of any analyticity consideration , and only with the purpose of satisfying the hypothesis of lebesgue s theorem , introduces a non - analyticity in the sequence of integrals of @xmath305 even for finite @xmath11 .",
    "but even for the case where @xmath28 is fixed to a constant @xmath268 , discussed before , in which the limit @xmath45 is taken first , and then @xmath268 is sent to infinity , and therefore the sequence is made out of truly analytic functions , the convergence towards @xmath178 is perfectly compatible with analyticity considerations .",
    "the functions @xmath267 ( the result of the @xmath45 limit ) , are clearly analytic in @xmath6 .",
    "but they converge to ( in fact they define ! ) the nonanalytic function @xmath178 when @xmath269 .",
    "the limit of an infinite sequence of analytic functions does not have to be analytic .",
    "another important issue is that the same method works also for the  negative mass case \" , where the borel resummation method fails .",
