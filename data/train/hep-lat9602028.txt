    "lattice field theory has an important role to play in the study of @xmath3-physics . through this approach it is possible not only to perform a first principles calculation of experimentally important quantities , but also to test heavy quark symmetry predictions of heavy quark effective theory  ( hqet ) and extract the nonperturbative coefficients of the heavy quark expansions which are required to extract numerical results from hqet .",
    "furthermore , comparison with the predictions of various models for these coefficients provides a test of the underlying assumptions of the models .",
    "the first stage of a lattice study of @xmath3 mesons is the calculation of the spectrum . as the simplest quantity to extract , it is the foundation for more complicated calculations of @xmath3 decay processes .",
    "a correct reproduction of the spectrum gives confidence in the calculational procedure , as well as providing predictions for states not yet measured experimentally . in the spectrum , several physical scales are important .",
    "the gross structure of the @xmath3 spectrum is due to excitations of the light quark and hence mass splittings related to these , such as @xmath5 and @xmath0 are of @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , the heavy quark is approximately a static colour source and its spin affects the spectrum at the scale of the hyperfine splitting , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , to reproduce the spectrum , the systematic errors arising from both the heavy and light quarks must be rigorously controlled .",
    "previously , simulating the @xmath2 quark ( as opposed to a static quark ) on the lattice presented a major problem since the @xmath8 discretisation errors of the standard relativistic fermionic action were @xmath9 for a @xmath2 quark on a typical lattice , @xmath10  gev .",
    "however , the success of the non - relativistic qcd  ( nrqcd ) approach in calculations of @xmath11 spectroscopy  @xcite shows that the @xmath2 quark can be simulated directly on lattices currently available . in nrqcd",
    "the heavy quark mass scale is removed and the action becomes an expansion in the typical  ( non - relativistic ) heavy quark velocity , which is a small parameter .",
    "the precision of the calculation is controlled simply by the order at which the expansion is truncated . for heavy - light mesons , the terms included in the action at each order in the heavy quark velocity",
    "is determined by the order of the terms in @xmath12 ; this is discussed in more detail in reference  @xcite .",
    "considering the almost spectator role of the heavy quark in the heavy - light meson , we include only first order i.e. @xmath13 terms in the nrqcd action in this study .    for light quarks ,",
    "recent studies have shown  @xcite that the @xmath14 discretisation errors of the wilson action are significant for a high statistics calculation on typical lattices even for small bare masses  ( i.e. the constituent mass seems to be the important scale for @xmath14 effects ) .",
    "improved light fermion actions , for example the tadpole - improved clover action with errors of roughly @xmath15 , are needed . however , in this initial calculation we have employed the wilson action and expect this to give rise to the dominant systematic error .    another uncertainty in connecting lattice calculations to the physical world is the quenched approximation . in this study",
    "we have partially included the effects of dynamical quarks .",
    "in addition , these computations are performed in conjunction with a simulation using @xmath16 quenched configurations  @xcite and in the future we expect to be able to isolate and remove the full effects of quenching .    the organisation of this paper is as follows .",
    "the details of the simulation are given in section  [ simdet ] followed by a discussion of the expected systematic errors .",
    "particular attention has been paid in our analysis to the fitting procedure and extraction of ground and excited state energies .",
    "our methods are outlined in section  [ fitanal ] and illustrated with a subset of the data .",
    "we use the results over a range of heavy quark masses to investigate heavy quark symmetry in the meson binding energy in section  [ hqsym ] .",
    "the lowest order coefficients of the heavy quark expansion @xmath17 and @xmath18 are extracted .",
    "the heavy - light meson mass is calculated in section  [ mesonmass ] ; three methods are compared and their range of validity investigated . in section  [ massplit ]",
    "we turn to the mass splittings , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and compare the simulation results with experiment and the expectations of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "the conclusions and a summary of the spectrum are given in section  [ conc ] .",
    "the simulations were performed using 100 @xmath22 gauge configurations at @xmath23 with two flavours of staggered dynamical sea quarks with a bare quark mass of @xmath24 .",
    "these configurations were generously made available by the collaboration ; more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we fixed the configurations to the coulomb gauge .",
    "the light quark propagators were generated using the wilson fermion action , without an @xmath25 improvement term , at two values of the hopping parameter , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the former corresponds to a quark mass close to strange , where @xmath28 from @xmath29 , while @xmath27 is somewhat lighter , with @xmath30 .    in this simulation",
    "we truncate the nrqcd series at @xmath31 and the action takes the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 tadpole improvement of the gauge links is used throughout , where @xmath34 measured from the plaquette , and the hyperfine coefficient is given the tree - level value @xmath35 .",
    "we use the standard clover - leaf operator for the @xmath3 field .",
    "a constant mass term has been omitted from the action for simplicity of the calculation .",
    "it has no effect on mass splittings and amplitudes and a suitable energy shift for all masses can be added post - simulation .",
    "this will be discussed in further detail in section  [ mesonmass ] .",
    "the heavy quark propagators were computed using the evolution equation : @xmath36 in the static limit this reduces to @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 is introduced to stabilise unphysical higher momentum modes as @xmath39 is decreased and from perturbation theory one estimates @xmath40 .",
    "this is only a rough guide and for a high statistics simulation a more conservative lower limit on @xmath38 may be needed to ensure a smooth transition between regions of different @xmath38 as @xmath39 decreases .",
    "this point will be illustrated in section  [ esim ] .",
    "the heavy quark propagators were computed over a range of values of @xmath39 to probe both the lower limit of nrqcd where the perturbative couplings diverge and the theory breaks down , around @xmath41  @xcite , and the @xmath42 limit where @xmath43 becomes poor as nrqcd tends to the static limit .",
    "note that for heavy - light mesons there is no upper limit imposed on @xmath39 by discretisation errors in the heavy quark motion , @xmath44 independent of @xmath39  ( where we take @xmath45 for these configurations ) .",
    "this is in contrast to heavy - heavy mesons where the kinetic energy , not the momentum , of the heavy quark is approximately @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus , discretisation errors naively become large when @xmath48 i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "we generated heavy quark propagators at 11 values of ( @xmath50,@xmath38 ) corresponding to ( 0.8,5 ) , ( 1.0,4 ) , ( 1.2,3 ) , ( 1.7,2 ) , ( 2.0,2 ) , ( 2.5,2 ) , ( 3.0,2 ) , ( 3.5,1 ) , ( 4.0,1 ) , ( 7.0,1 ) and ( 10.0,1 ) , and the static limit .",
    "this roughly corresponds to a range of meson masses from @xmath51 to @xmath52 and is sufficient for a reasonable investigation of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "however , it is not possible to simulate the @xmath53 meson on this lattice using nrqcd ; a larger lattice spacing is required , @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "a nrqcd heavy quark propagator describes the forward propagation of a quark . to increase statistics we applied the time reversal transformation to both the gauge fields and the light quark propagators and repeated the heavy quark evolution ;",
    "this is equivalent to calculating the propagation of the backwardly moving anti - particle .    following the methods of  @xcite meson correlation functions corresponding to both @xmath56 and @xmath57 states",
    "were constructed from the quark propagators using interpolating operators at the source of the form : @xmath58 and @xmath59 at the sink , where @xmath60 specifies the quantum numbers  ( @xmath61 ) of the state , detailed in table  [ ops ] , and the smearing  ( @xmath62 ) applied to the heavy quark .",
    "smearing functions motivated by the hydrogen model were chosen to project out the ground and first excited state ; for s - states @xmath63 where @xmath64 . similarly for p - states @xmath65 it is sufficient to use the same radius , @xmath66 , for all @xmath39 since the heavy quark is almost a spectator in the heavy - light system and the meson wavefunction is not expected to change significantly with @xmath39 .",
    "a delta function was also used for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 states .",
    ".the lattice operators , @xmath61 , and associated quantum numbers used in the simulation .",
    "@xmath61 is a @xmath67 matrix in spin space .",
    "note that since charge conjugation is not a good quantum number for the heavy - light system there is mixing between the @xmath68 and @xmath69 states.[ops ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      another quantity of interest is the @xmath70 splitting , which is expected to be very weakly dependent on the heavy quark mass at the @xmath71 level .",
    "in addition , as the splitting is the difference of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 binding energies it is expected to be @xmath74  mev .",
    "experimentally , @xmath75  mev . in order to extract the splitting we chirally extrapolated @xmath76 using the energies from the data at @xmath77 which are extracted using the @xmath78 fits to @xmath79 correlators with the fitting range @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ sdmassdiff ] presents our results for the splitting , which are consistent with no heavy quark mass dependence . converting to physical units we obtain @xmath81  mev ; consistent with experiment within the large systematic uncertainties arising from both @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we presented a lattice study of the heavy - light spectrum in the region of the @xmath3 meson , the first to partially include the effects of dynamical quarks .",
    "a multi - smearing , multi - state fitting analysis was performed and the ground @xmath56 and @xmath57 states as well as the excited @xmath56 states were extracted .",
    "figure  [ spect ] summarizes the results for the @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "this is a high statistics calculation and the systematic errors arising from the wilson light quarks , indicated in the figure , are the dominant uncertainty . within these errors",
    "the results obtained are in agreement with experiment .",
    "we are in the process of repeating the calculation using tadpole - improved clover light fermions .",
    "this will allow a comparison with our quenched results , in progress , which use the same light fermions .",
    "we performed a comprehensive calculation of the heavy - light meson mass , investigating three methods and their range of validity .",
    "the agreement found between these methods confirms that lorentz invariance can be restored at this order in nrqcd by a constant shift to all masses .",
    "we calculated the spectrum over a wide range of heavy quark masses enabling a detailed investigation of heavy quark symmetry . for the binding energy and mass splittings",
    "the corrections to the heavy quark limit were found to be in agreement with naive expectations based on a hydrogen - like picture of the heavy - light meson .",
    "however , there is an indication from the mass dependence of the ground @xmath56-state energy that for quark masses around @xmath84 the next order in the nrqcd expansion is required .",
    "using our tadpole - improved approach the nonperturbative coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 were extracted .",
    "we showed that previous lattice calculations have large tadpole contributions and when we correct for this using mean field theory we find agreement with our results .",
    "the major error remaining is a perturbative one .",
