    "our understanding of electroweak processes on the deuteron is reaching a critical juncture .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory is taking data , and a thorough understanding of neutrino - deuteron scattering is an important part of the analysis in that experiment  @xcite . of further note , there is a proposal for a high - precision measurement of the reaction @xmath0 in the orland experiment  @xcite .",
    "theorists have made a tremendous effort to understand @xmath1-@xmath2 scattering in a potential model framework  @xcite , with the most recent independent efforts agreeing within a few percent at low - energy   @xcite . given the ongoing experimental interest in these processes ,",
    "efforts began to study @xmath3-@xmath2 scattering in the language of effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite for neutrino energies below 20  mev .",
    "the eft work employed the power - counting scheme of kaplan , savage , and wise@xcite and included pions . in working to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , it was found in ref .  @xcite that theoretical uncertainties in the reactions @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 were dominated by an unknown axial two - body counterterm @xmath7 .",
    "it was possible to find different values of @xmath8 which provided excellent fits to the potential model calculations of refs .",
    "further , we found that the ratio of charged - current to neutral current ( cc / nc ) cross - sections was insensitive to this counterterm .",
    "this confirmed the insensitivity to short - distance physics first discussed by ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it is not clear whether a power - counting scheme exists which would allow us to extend the theory with pions to higher - order @xcite , as would be required to constrain our theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in this work , we employ the theory without pions  @xcite ( also see earlier works  @xcite ) which has proven so successful in providing for high - precision calculations for other processes like @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to consider next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) corrections , and to incorporate coulomb effects cleanly , following the prescription of kong and ravndal  @xcite with some generalization . as a result",
    ", we present a complete set of calculations for all four reaction channels including the most - important @xmath10 channel .",
    "no new parameters are introduced at this order , so it becomes a stringent test of the convergence of the calculation and thus on the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "further , new potential model calculations exist   @xcite and a further comparison with those is worthwhile , given that these new calculations yield different results at threshold to those in ref .",
    "we continue to emphasize the importance of fixing the axial counterterm through a direct experimental measurement .",
