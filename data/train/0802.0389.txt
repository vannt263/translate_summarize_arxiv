    "quantum spin chains have received much attention during the last more than 70 years for several reasons .",
    "first , they provide an excellent ground for studying rigorously quantum many - particle phenomena .",
    "second , owing to the tremendous progress in material sciences ( as well as the recent availability of optical lattices for trapping atoms in artificial crystals ) many real - life systems , which can be modeled as quantum spin chains invented by theoreticians , have become available . that opens the possibility to compare the results of accurate theoretical calculations with experimental data .",
    "dynamic quantities for quantum spin chains are of special interest and importance . on the one hand , their study , as a rule , is a harder problem in comparison with similar studies of static quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "dynamic quantities are related to experimental data obtained in scattering and resonance experiments which yield valuable information about the magnetic structure of materials provided one has a reliable theory for their interpretation .",
    "therefore , the theoretical analysis of the dynamic quantities for quantum spin chains is significant both from theoretical / academic and experimental / practical points of view .    since the early 1930s",
    "the bethe ansatz has been known as a powerful method of exploring quantum spin chains .",
    "however , only recently it has become possible to calculate quantities such as norms of and matrix elements between bethe ansatz states which are necessary to calculate dynamic quantities . for recent bethe ansatz results on the ground - state dynamic structure factors of the spin-1/2 @xmath1 heisenberg chain",
    "see refs . .",
    "we also mention here the field - theoretical approaches for evaluation of the dynamic quantities @xcite which , however , are restricted to low - energy physics only and therefore can only give the dynamic quantities in a small part of the plane wave - vector @xmath2 - frequency @xmath3 ( hereinafter the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane ) .",
    "traditionally , those calculations were performed for the tomonaga - luttinger model , which describes one - dimensional spinless fermions moving in a continuum , with linear dispersion relation .",
    "recently , however , the curvature of the dispersion relation has been taken into account in calculating the properties of quantum wires @xcite .",
    "the spin-1/2 @xmath1 chain is a lattice system closely related to these continuum models .",
    "the low - energy and long - wavelength limit of its ground - state @xmath4 dynamic structure factor was recently studied by combining several analytic and numeric techniques @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite an extension of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method was proposed which allows for the calculation of real - time correlation functions of @xmath1 chains at arbitrary finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , numerical limitations presently restrict the time range over which results are reliable to values comparable to those reached in complete diagonalization studies @xcite",
    ".    another exactly solvable class of quantum spin chains are spin-1/2 @xmath5 chains . rigorous analysis of these systems is based on exploiting the jordan - wigner transformation to spinless fermions @xcite .",
    "( for a relation between the bethe ansatz method and the jordan - wigner approach for the spin-1/2 @xmath6 ( i.e. isotropic @xmath5 ) chain see ref . .",
    ") although after applying the jordan - wigner transformation to the spin-1/2 @xmath5 chains one faces a system of noninteracting spinless fermions the calculation of the spin correlation functions is not a trivial problem because of the nonlocal character of the transformation .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 spin correlations are related to the two - fermion ( density - density ) correlations , whereas , e.g. , the @xmath7 spin correlations are related to many - fermion correlations . accordingly , the @xmath4 dynamics is well studied @xcite , whereas closed - form expressions , e.g. , for the @xmath7 dynamic quantities are rather scarce @xcite ( see also references in ref . ) .    in the present paper",
    "we consider several quantum spin chains with regular alternation or random disorder in the nearest - neighbor interactions and follow the effect of such modifications on the dynamic structure factors .",
    "the inhomogeneity introduced refers mainly to the sign of interactions and may mimic the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic types of nearest - neighbor exchange coupling .",
    "the interest in models of such a kind is not purely theoretical .",
    "recently some organic and inorganic magnets have been recognized as alternating sign @xcite , random bond @xcite and alternating random bond @xcite antiferromagnetic spin chains . the dynamic study of the quantum spin chain material with bond randomness bacu@xmath8(si@xmath9ge@xmath10)@xmath8o@xmath11 , @xmath12 using inelastic neutron scattering revealed that its dynamic structure factor can be fitted by the mller ansatz @xcite surprisingly well @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the dynamic properties of the random - bond heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin chain and the bacu@xmath8(si@xmath9ge@xmath10)@xmath8o@xmath11 compound has been confirmed numerically by the quantum monte - carlo method @xcite .    in our calculation of dynamic quantities",
    "we use appropriate transformations to eliminate the inhomogeneity from the spin hamiltonian arriving at the homogenous model the dynamic properties of which are well known .",
    "thus we reduce the complex behavior of dynamic quantities for periodic / random quantum spin chains to the known dynamic properties of the homogenous model . in what follows we deal with spin-1/2 isotropic @xmath5 (",
    "@xmath0 or @xmath6 ) chains since the dynamic quantities for the more general case of the @xmath1 heisenberg exchange interaction are less known .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . to the end of this section",
    "we introduce the spin model , the quantities of interest and recall some results for the dynamic quantities obtained within the jordan - wigner fermionization approach which are used in the following sections . in sec .",

    "earlier we have to put @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and therefore @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 and we reproduce eqs .",
    "( [ 3.08 ] ) , ( [ 3.09 ] ) with the expressions for @xmath199 and @xmath229 given just before eq .",
    "( [ 3.08 ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we have considered a number of inhomogeneous ( periodic or random ) spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains , to examine their dynamic properties .",
    "the models considered are distinguished by the possibility to eliminate the inhomogeneity from the spin hamiltonian by a suitable unitary transformation ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 2.01 ] ) , ( [ 3.01 ] ) ) and therefore to reduce the problem to the well known one for the uniform model .",
    "we use exact analytical and precise numerical data to analyze the dynamic structure factors of the periodic / random spin-1/2 @xmath0 chains .",
    "the models considered show rather complex behavior which , however , can be explained by the corresponding properties of the basic uniform model .",
    "thus , for the periodic chains only the correspondingly modified characteristic curves eqs .",
    "( [ 1.04 ] ) , ( [ 1.06 ] ) are seen in the complex pattern displayed by the dynamic structure factor at low temperatures . in the high - temperature limit only eq .",
    "( [ 1.07 ] ) is relevant . in the cases",
    "considered the observed complexity has a simple origin .",
    "we also stress here that we have reported rigorous analytical results for dynamic structure factors of some periodic / random quantum spin chains . in comparison , direct numerical treatment of random quantum spin chains",
    "would imply many calculations of dynamic quantities for different realizations of the random couplings and a subsequent average over these realizations , which altogether would require an enormous amount of computer time .",
    "it is interesting to note that the effects of temperature and of random couplings on the @xmath7/@xmath58 dynamic structure factors are different ( compare eq .",
    "( [ 1.07 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ 2.08 ] ) , ( [ 2.11 ] ) ) .",
    "although in both cases only the autocorrelation function determines the dynamic structure factor ( for sufficiently high temperature or sufficiently strong randomness ) , at high temperatures the dynamic structure factor is @xmath2-independent and shows gaussian ridges ( see eq .",
    "( [ 1.07 ] ) ) . that is due to the gaussian time decay of the autocorrelation function",
    "@xcite which should be contrasted to the slow long - time decay of the autocorrelation function at low temperatures .",
    "the spin chain models discussed in our study are obviously of a rather special kind , and it would be highly desirable to obtain reliable results also for more general types of inhomogeneity in the interspin couplings , where not only the signs but also the absolute values of the couplings vary . for those more general models ,",
    "however , the present methods are not applicable , and different methods or approximations have to be employed , such as in refs .",
    ", for example .",
    "the special models treated in our present study will then be useful in providing a testing ground for the more general ( but possibly less reliable ) methods capable of dealing with a broader class of systems .",
    "finally , the dynamic structure factors provide benchmarks for determining interspin interactions . in our paper",
    "we have demonstrated by some examples how periodic modulations or random variations in the signs of nearest - neighbor interactions manifest themselves in the dynamic structure factor .",
    "we note that the techniques used here for @xmath0 chains may also be applied to study dynamic structure factors of more general @xmath1 chains with periodic or random sign changes in the @xmath5 part of the interactions , provided that sufficiently precise data for the corresponding uniform systems become available .",
