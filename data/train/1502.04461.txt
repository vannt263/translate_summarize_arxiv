    "x - ray binary pulsars ( xbps ) are systems consisting of magnetized neutron stars and mass - donating stellar companions .",
    "since the neutron stars are strongly magnetized , the matter flows from the companion are dominated by the magnetic pressure inside the alfven radius , and then funneled onto the magnetic poles along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the accretion matter also transfers its angular momentum at the alfven radius .",
    "therefore , the pulsar spin - up rate and the mass accretion rate , i.e. the x - ray luminosity , are thought to be closely correlated ( e.g. ghosh & lamb 1979 , hereafter gl79",
    "the issue is relevant to the fundamental parameters of the neutron stars such as mass , radius , and magnetic field , as well as the xbp evolution scenarios .",
    "be xbps , which include be stars extending circumstellar disk around the equator , are one of the major xbp subgroups @xcite .",
    "they often exhibit large outbursts lasting for about a few weeks to a few months mostly at around the orbital phase of the neutron - star periastron passage . during these outbursts ,",
    "simultaneous spin - up episodes are often observed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is naturally explained by an increase in the accretion rate induced by the interaction with be - star disk , and the associated transfer of the angular momentum to the neutron star via disc - magnetosphare coupling .",
    "these events give us an opportunity to study the relation between the luminosity and the spin - up rate quantitatively .    in this paper",
    ", we present the study on the relation using the long - term light curve obtained by the maxi / gsc all - sky survey and the period change obtained from the archived results of fermi / gbm pulsar project .",
    "these data , taken by the continuous monitor for over four years , enable us to investigate their time variations over the entire outburst activities in be xbps . we describe the observation in @xmath2 [ sec : obs_data ] , the analysis procedure in @xmath2 [ sec : analysis ] , and then discuss about the obtained results in @xmath2 [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "since the maxi ( monitor of all - sky x - ray image ; @xcite ) experiment onboard the international space station started in 2009 august , the gsc ( gas slit camera ; @xcite ) , one of the two maxi detectors , has been scanning almost the whole sky every 92-minute orbital cycle in the 230 kev band . to obtain the long - term luminosity variation of",
    "be xbps covering the outbursts as well as the intermission / quiescence , we use archived gsc light - curve data in 220 kev band , which are processed with a standard procedure @xcite by the maxi team and archived at maxi web site@xcite .",
    "the gbm ( gamma - ray burst monitor ; @xcite ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , is an all - sky instrument sensitive to x - rays and gamma - rays with energies between 8 kev and 40 mev .",
    "the fermi gbm pulsar project @xcite provides results of timing analysis of a number of positively detected x - ray pulsars , including their pulsation periods and pulsed fluxes via the web site @xcite since the in - orbit operation started in 2008 july .",
    "we utilized the archived pulse period data of be xbps .",
    "we selected five be xbps , gx 304@xmath01 , a 0535@xmath126 , gro j1008@xmath057 , ks 1947@xmath1300 and 2s 1417@xmath0624 from targets listed in the maxi / gsc and the fermi / gbm archive for this study , because they exhibited large outburst activities in the last four years and their surface magnetic fields are well determined by the cycloton resonance feature in the x - ray spectrum ( execpt for 2s 1417@xmath0624 ) . table [ tab : beparam ] summarized characteristic parameters of these be xbps and figure [ fig : lx_period_fit ] shows the time variation of the bolometric luminosity calculated from maxi / gsc 220 kev light curve data and that of the pulse period obtained from the fermi / gbm pulsar data during outbursts for each source .",
    "observed pulse - period variations of xbps include two distinct effects , the intrinsic pulsar spin - period change and the orbital doppler effect . in be xbps ,",
    "both of them are supposed to correlate with the orbital phase .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to resolve each component from the observed data . although the pulse period data of xbps in the fermi / gbm archive are corrected for the orbital doppler effect if their orbital elements are determined , the orbital elements have not been known in all of the be xbps with our interests .",
    "hence , we construct a semi - empirical model implementing both these effects and then fit it to the data , in an attempt to simultaneously determine the intrinsic pulse period change and the orbital elements .",
    "we here employ the simple theoretical model of the pulsar spin - up by the mass accretion via disk , proposed by gl79 @xcite .",
    "the model has been examined with x - ray data , and its validity and limits are well studied ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this model , the pulsar spin - up rate @xmath3 ( s yr@xmath4 ) is given by @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star in units of @xmath13 g @xmath14 , radius in @xmath15 cm , mass in @xmath16 , moment of inertia in @xmath17 g @xmath18 , spin perid in s , luminosity in @xmath19 erg s@xmath4 , @xmath20 is a dimensionless torque that depends on the fastness parameter @xmath21 and approximately constant at @xmath22 in slow rotating pulsars satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "the equation [ equ : pdot ] implies that the spin - up rate @xmath3 follows the luminosity @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "the power - law index @xmath26 in a model of @xmath27 obtained from the fit to the observed data sometimes disagreed with the theoretical value of @xmath28 and favor the rather higher value of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "besides this , the comparison of absolute spin - up rate with equation [ equ : pdot ] has been hampered by a large uncertainty in the bolometric luminosity correction , which is in turn due to beaming effects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we hence employ the spin - up model expressed by @xmath30 in which the power - law index @xmath31 and a correlation factor , @xmath32 s d@xmath4 ( @xmath33 ) reduced from the equation [ equ : pdot ] and typical neutron - star parameters of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are treated as free parameters .",
    "xbps are also known to spin down during the quiescence due to the propeller effects .",
    "the rate is much smaller than the spin - up during the outburst bright phases , but may not be negligible .",
    "we accounted its effect with a constant spin - down parameter , @xmath37 , added to @xmath38 as an offset .",
    "by combining the spin - up and spin - down models above , the intrinsic pulsar - spin period @xmath39 is expressed by @xmath40 where we set the time basis @xmath41 at the first periastron passage in the period under analysis and define the pulsation period at the time @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "the model equation [ equ : pspinmod ] includes four free parameters , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath37 , @xmath26 and requires the luminosity data @xmath45 as a function of time .",
    "we calculated the luminosity from data of the maxi / gsc 220 kev light curve in 1-d time bin assuming the source distance , the typical energy spectrum of a cutoff power law from the past results , and the source emission to be isotopic .",
    "the period modulation due to the binary orbital motion is calculated by using the binary elements , which consists of orbital period @xmath46 , eccentricity @xmath47 , projected semi - major axis @xmath48 , epoch @xmath41 and argument @xmath49 of the periastron .",
    "the pulsar orbital velocity @xmath50 along the line of sight is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a parameter called true anomaly describing the motion on the elliptical orbit and calculated from the kepler s equation . the observed pulse period , @xmath53 ,",
    "is then expressed by @xmath54    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath55 : the surface magnetic field @xmath56 has not been measured .",
    "it is assumed to be @xmath57 g.      we applied the spin - period - change model , @xmath39 in equation [ equ : pspinmod ] , to the fermi / gbm archived period data for a 0535@xmath126 , ks 1947@xmath1300 , and 2s 1417@xmath0624 , in which the binary orbital effects were corrected with the known orbital elements . about gro j1008@xmath057",
    ", the orbital effects are not corrected in the archived data , but the orbital elements have been estimated by @xcite .",
    "we thus fit the data to the period model , @xmath53 in equation [ equ : pobsmod ] , which includes the orbital effect , employing the orbital elements given in @xcite . about gx 304@xmath01 , its orbital elements have not been measured .",
    "we fit the period data with the model @xmath53 in which the orbital elements are floated .    as results of many model - fit attempts",
    ", we found that the model is able to reproduce the data approximately with @xmath58 in all of the five targets .",
    "we thus fix the parameter @xmath26 at @xmath28 , predicted by gl79 @xcite , in order to concentrate on the correlation factor @xmath44 , hereafter . in figure",
    "[ fig : lx_period_fit ] bottom panels , the obtained best - fit models with @xmath31 are superposed on the period data . the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : beparam ] , where the values of @xmath44 are given by the ratio to that ( @xmath33 ) predicted by gl79 @xcite .",
    "we fitted pulse period variation of five be xbps observed with fermi / gbm to the model implementing the spin - up due to the mass accretion via disk , expressed by @xmath59 based on gl79 @xcite and the luminosity estimated from the maxi / gsc light curve .",
    "the results show that the model successfully reproduce the data in all of the five samples .",
    "the obtained best - fit parameters imply that the correlation factor @xmath44 from the luminosity @xmath60 to the spin - up rate @xmath61 largely agree with @xmath62 predicted by gl79 @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the ratio , @xmath63 to @xmath64 , is naturally expected from the uncertainty in the bolometric luminosity correction due to the beaming effect",
    ".    however , the values of @xmath65 seems to have some tendency against the pulse period , the orbital period , and the eccentricity , which are suggested to have a relation with be - xbp subgroups @xcite .",
    "this will become clearer with increasing data in the near future ."
