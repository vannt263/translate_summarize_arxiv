    "the existence of li - rich ( a(li ) @xmath5 ) giant stars implies an additional mechanism that produces and/or preserves surface li",
    ". this process may be internal or external . in the right conditions stars",
    "can produce li internally through the cameron - fowler mechanism @xcite : @xmath6 .",
    "the temperature must be hot enough for @xmath7be to be produced , but @xmath7be must be quickly transported towards cooler regions so that fresh @xmath7li can be created without being immediately destroyed by proton capture .",
    "the cameron - fowler mechanism can operate in red giants in two different stages . during hot bottom burning ( hbb ) ,",
    "the bottom of the convective envelope is hot enough for @xmath7be production .",
    "the convection carries @xmath7be to cooler regions where it can capture an electron to produce @xmath7li . in the absence of hbb , a radiative zone exists between the shell and the convective envelope . a mechanism is then required to mix material down to the outer part of the shell  where temperatures are high enough to produce @xmath7be  and then fresh @xmath7be must be mixed across the radiative zone to the convective envelope .",
    "the mechanism for mixing through the radiative zone is under debate , but various mechanisms are collectively referred to as ` deep - mixing ' or ` extra - mixing ' .",
    "moreover , because the conditions required to produce @xmath7li are also sufficient to destroy it ( e.g. , by mixing fresh @xmath7li back to hotter regions ) , the level of subsequent li - enhancement due to extra mixing is critically sensitive to the mixing speed , geometry , and episodicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to reconcile the existence of li - rich giant stars , including ones that aim to minimise the amount of partial burning ( i.e. , preserve existing li ) .",
    "however using _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite and stellar tracks to precisely estimate stellar masses and evolutionary states , @xcite highlight fifteen li - rich giants where li preservation is insufficient : a li-_production _ mechanism is required to match the data . while precise , li abundance measurements can be limited by the stellar tracks employed ( e.g. , including the horizontal or asymptotic branch for low - mass stars ) , emphasising the need for accurate knowledge of the evolutionary status .",
    "@xcite propose two distinct episodes of li production that depend on the stellar mass .",
    "for low - mass rgb stars at the bump in the luminosity function , the outward - moving hydrogen shell burns through the mean molecular weight discontinuity produced during first dredge up , enabling extra mixing and facilitating the cameron - fowler mechanism .",
    "however in intermediate - mass stars , the composition discontinuity is not destroyed until after the star begins core he burning .",
    "for this reason extra mixing can only be induced in intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars when the convective envelope deepens at the base of the agb .",
    "while these scenarios explain the necessary internal conditions required to produce and transport li to the photosphere , they do not speculate on the actual mechanism that drives the mixing ( however see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have shown that rotation alone is insufficient to produce the observed li abundances , implying that an additional mechanism is required to induce the extra mixing .",
    "thermohaline mixing has been proposed as a mechanism to drive extra mixing at the bump in the giant branch luminosity function .",
    "in addition to removing any existing molecular weight gradient , an inversion in the molecular weight gradient is produced , which drives thermohaline mixing @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite incorporate diffusion and shear - driven mixing to facilitate extra - mixing in low - mass rgb stars .",
    "their prescription relies on main - sequence stars ( as the precursors of upper rgb stars ) to possess rapidly rotating radiative cores . instead of encouraging interactions between different mass shells ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite require the specific angular momentum to be conserved in each shell during the star s evolution .",
    "this situation would therefore permit a reservoir of angular momentum which could later induce deep mixing .",
    "@xcite proposed that internal instabilities occurring near the luminosity bump were sufficient to produce additional li .",
    "specifically , internally - produced @xmath7be could be transported to a nearby convective region where @xmath7li is produced , but immediately destroyed by proton capture . in effect , a thin burning layer of li is created , where @xmath8 becomes the dominant reaction , increasing the local temperature and the level of meridional circulation .",
    "the molecular weight gradient is eventually destroyed , allowing for deep mixing to occur .",
    "while promising , this scenario requires an arbitrary and substantially large change in diffusion rates .",
    "a significant amount of mass - loss is expected as a consequence of this scenario , as well as an excess in infrared colours .",
    "given extensive investigations into the ( lack of ) association between far infrared excesses and li - rich giants , it would appear this scenario may be unlikely , unless the infrared excess phase is short @xcite .",
    "the extra mixing required may be induced by external phenomena .",
    "the ingestion of a massive planet or brown dwarf would contribute significant angular momentum to the system , producing additional li before it is destroyed by convection @xcite .",
    "in this scenario the planet is assumed to be dissipated at the base of the convective envelope of a giant star , causing the star to substantially expand in size .",
    "if the accretion rate is high , hbb can be triggered .",
    "the predicted observational signatures vary depending on the accretion rate and the ingestion angle of the planet / dwarf .",
    "however , the predicted observables include increased mass loss and/or the ejection of a shell ( and therefore a subsequent phase of infrared emission ) , an increase in the @xmath7li surface abundance , potential stellar metallicity enrichment , possibly increased rotational velocity due to the transfer of angular momentum , and less discernible effects such as the generation of magnetic fields ( however see * ? ? ? * ) or changes to the morphology of the horizontal branch .",
    "@xcite argue that the planet / dwarf star accretion scenario is not limited to a single evolutionary stage , allowing for li - rich giants to exist on the red giant and the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "it can also advantageously explain stars with either high or low rotational velocities , depending on the extent that magnetic braking has influenced spin - down .",
    "however , there has been no discussion in the literature on how this scenario alone relates to why li - rich giants tend to appear more frequently just below the rgb bump ( e.g. , see figure [ fig : literature ] ) .",
    "similarly , there has been no discussion of links between li - rich giant stars and the properties or occurrence rates of exoplanet host stars .",
    "@xcite propose a novel external mechanism to reconcile observations of li - rich giant stars .",
    "high li abundances detected in the secondaries of a stellar - mass black hole @xcite and neutron star @xcite candidates led to the postulation that li could be produced during a supernova explosion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through @xmath9-@xmath9 reactions during strong outbursts from a transient x - ray binary system .",
    "these conditions could be sufficiently energetic to induce cosmic - ray spallation and produce li @xcite .",
    "li would presumably be accreted to the edge of the convective envelope of the secondary thereby producing a li - rich giant star , potentially at any stage across the rgb , with low rotational velocities .",
    "a consequence of li spallation is that beryllium and boron would also be created . to date",
    ", no li - rich giant star has been found to have be enhancement @xcite .",
    "finally , although no long - term radial velocity studies have been conducted , the non - detection of a white dwarf companion in the vicinity of a present - day li - rich giant star weakens this idea .",
    "observations have been key to guiding models that can explain li - rich giant stars .",
    "unfortunately most li - rich giant stars are not distinguishable by their photometric colours , therefore they can not be efficiently selected solely on the basis of photometry .",
    "early observations of far - infrared colours showed that many li - rich stars show far - infrared excesses @xcite , suggesting that the li - rich phase was associated with a mass - loss event .",
    "however later k - giant selections based on far - infrared colour excesses did not reveal any new li - rich stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied this phenomenon extensively and revealed that the largest infrared excesses do indeed appear in li - rich k giants ( typically with fast rotation , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although very few li - rich k giants show any infrared excess .",
    "@xcite came to the same conclusion from a study of @xmath10 k giants . therefore , if mass - loss or dust shell production is a regular consequence of the li - enrichment mechanism , the infrared excess phase must be short @xcite",
    ".    discoveries of li - rich giant stars have been slow relative to advances in modelling .",
    "their sparsity is partly to blame : only 1% of slow",
    "rotating k giant stars are li - rich ( although @xmath050% of rapid rotating k giants are li - rich , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , despite large observational programs dedicated to obtaining high - quality spectra in clusters , fewer than ten li - rich giants have been discovered in globular clusters ( 2 in ngc  362 , m3-iv101 , m5-v42 , m68-a96 , etc ; * ? ? ?",

    "there are multiple analysis nodes .",
    "a node consists of a sufficiently distinct pipeline , and expert spectroscopists that are familiar with the pipeline employed .",

    "this is important to note , as not all stars targeted by wg12 are later found to be pre - main - sequence stars ; some stars targeted by wg12 are actually standard fgk - type stars .",
    "half ( 10 ) of our li - rich giant stars were analysed by wg10 or wg11 .",

    "reports individual chemical abundances for up to 45 species in idr4 : 34 elements at different ionisation stages .",
    "these range from @xmath19@xmath20 ( li to eu ) and include odd - z , @xmath9- , fe - peak , as well as neutron - capture ( @xmath21- and @xmath22-process ) elements .",
    "the resolution , wavelength coverage , and s / n of the giraffe sample is inferior to uves , therefore only a maximum of 15 species are available from giraffe spectra .",
    "given the s / n and spectral type of our li - rich giant sample , for some stars we report abundances for only a few ( or no ) elements .",
    "tables [ tab : abundances - giraffe]-[tab : lithium ] contain the detailed abundances for all li - rich giants in our sample .",
    "we find no obvious anomalous pattern in the detailed chemical abundances of our li - rich stars ( figure [ fig : uves - abundances ] ) .",

    "these measurements are listed in table [ tab : lithium ] , but throughout this text all abundances refer to those calculated in lte .",
    "there is little doubt that these stars are indeed li - rich . in figure",
    "[ fig : uves - spectra ] we show the spectra surrounding the li resonance doublet at 6707    and the subordinate line at 6103    for the li - rich stars observed with uves .",
    "a comparison giant star of similar stellar parameters is shown in each panel , highlighting the difference in li .",
    "the 6707    line is strong in all four stars and saturates in the bulge star 180337853009201 .",
    "the 6103    line is also visible .",
    "similarly , we show the 6707    line for all li - rich stars observed with giraffe in figure [ fig : giraffe - spectra ] , confirming their high li abundances .",
    "the 6103    line is not covered by the giraffe setups employed .",
    "we find only one li - rich giant star in our sample to be a fast rotator ( @xmath23  km s@xmath24 ) : 11000515 - 7623259 , the star towards chameleon 1 .",
    "we find no evidence of binarity in our sample : no significant secondary peak is seen in the cross - correlation function , and no spectral lines are repeated .",
    "however this does not preclude the possibility of a faint binary companion .",
    "repeat radial velocity measurements over a long baseline may be required to infer the presence of any companion .",
    "we searched for indications of significant mass - loss in our sample of li - rich stars .",
    "we cross - matched our sample with the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( hereafter wise , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) catalogues to search for infrared excesses that may be attributable to ejected shells or dust - loss .",
    "all stars had entries in 2mass and wise .",
    "we investigated all possible combinations of near- and mid - infrared colours and found no significant difference in the colours ( or magnitudes ) of our li - rich stars .",
    "two stars exhibited mild excesses in wise colours , but there are indications that the reported excess is due to source confusion and high background levels . if the li - rich stars in our sample are experiencing significant mass - loss as dust , that signature may only be observable in the far infrared .",
    "because these stars are ( relatively ) faint ( see table [ tab : stellar - parameters ] ) , they may not be visible in the far infrared even if a substantial relative excess exists due to the presence of a shell .",
    "giant stars experiencing significant mass - loss as gas often show blue - ward asymmetry in their h-@xmath9 profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : halpha - spectra ] shows spectra for all li - rich giant stars around the h-@xmath9 line .",
    "no obvious asymmetry is present for the uves sample .",
    "there is some suggestion of asymmetry in some of the giraffe li - rich giants , most notably 08102116 - 4740125 and 11000515 - 7623259 .",
    "however for most li - rich stars in our sample , there is weak evidence for any recent and significant mass loss , either in the form of gas , dust , or shells .",
    "the key to understanding the nature of the li production and preservation mechanisms in giant stars is to accurately know their evolutionary stage and the surrounding environment .",
    "although some of our li - rich stars have evolved past the rgb bump , the majority of our li - rich giants lie just below the rgb bump .",
    "this is consistent with other studies of li - rich giants of solar - metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure [ fig : literature ] ) , whereas most metal - poor li - rich giants have been found at more evolved stages : either slightly past the rgb bump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , towards the rgb tip , red clump , or on the agb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that many of our stars lie before the rgb bump is a genuine problem , because this is before the discontinuity in mean molecular weight can be destroyed , irrespective of mass .",
    "an alternative scenario is that these stars have simply been mis - classified as pre - bump stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they are more likely past the luminosity bump or are red clump stars .    below we discuss the observational signatures , the evolutionary stage , environment and membership thereof for all li - rich giant stars in our sample , before commenting on the plausibility of the proposed scenarios .",
    "half of our li - rich stars are in the direction of open clusters .",
    "this is due to an observational bias : the giraffe instrument setups used for the _ gaia - eso survey _  milky way fields do not include the li line .",
    "additional setups are used for clusters and special fields ( e.g. , the _ corot _  fields ) , which include li . the clusters surrounding each li - rich star are shown in table [ tab : stellar - parameters ] .",
    "below we discuss why these li - rich giant stars are unlikely to be bonafide cluster members .",
    "however , we stress that our conclusions are not conditional on ( non-)membership for any of the li - rich giant stars . while cluster membership clearly has an influence on the frequency of li - rich giant stars in the field and clusters ( section [ sec : frequency - discussion ] ) , these inferences are similarly complicated by the absence of quantifiable selection functions for other li - rich giant studies .",
    "we find two li - rich giants towards the young open cluster gamma2 velorum , neither of which are likely members .",

    "more crucially , any giants towards _ any young cluster _",
    "like gamma2 velorum ( 5 - 10  myr ) are extremely unlikely to be cluster members given the cluster age .",
    "this reasoning extends to 08395152 - 5315159 towards ic  2391 ( 53  myr ) , the li - rich giants towards ngc  2547 ( 35  myr ) and chamaeleon  1 ( 2  myr ) , and the four li - rich giant stars towards ic  2602 ( 32  myr ) .",
    "this argument does not extend to ngc  6802 , which is substantially older ( 1  gyr ) .",

    "the radial velocity is mildly ( @xmath25 ) inconsistent with the distribution of cluster velocities .",
    "finally , the metallicity places 19304281 + 2016107 a full 0.2  dex lower than the cluster mean , significantly away from the otherwise small dispersion in metallicity seen for this cluster .",

    "however , at least two , perhaps three , stars are consistent with being more evolved .",
    "193018830004175 is the coolest and most metal - poor li - rich star in our sample ( @xmath30  k , @xmath11 } = -0.52 $ ] ) .",
    "in contrast to observations where most li - rich giant stars are found below the rgb bump , 193018830004175 adds to the small sample of li - rich stars at more evolved stages .",
    "li - rich giant stars past the rgb bump are preferentially more metal - poor , consistent with 193018830004175 .    given the stellar parameters , 19230935 + 0123293 is consistent with being a red clump star .",
    "the uncertainties in stellar parameters for 19253819 + 0031094 are relatively large , therefore its exact evolutionary stage is uncertain . given the uncertainties in stellar parameters and the tendency of solar - metallicity li - rich giants to occur more frequently around the rgb bump , it is perhaps likely that 19230935 + 0123293 is indeed located near the rgb bump , as indicated by the reported stellar parameters . the ambiguity in evolutionary stage for these stars would be easily resolved if astereoseismic oscillations were detectable for these objects . however , at this stage , it would appear these stars are slightly too faint for the evolutionary stage to be derived from _ corot",
    "_  light curves .      here",
    "we discuss the plausibility of internal and external mechanisms proposed to reconcile observed properties of li - rich giants .",
    "we note that our data are inadequate to comment on external mechanisms involving supernovae or transient x - ray binaries , therefore we do not consider this hypothesis further .",
    "the internal scenarios that we have previously outlined describe the deep mixing conditions required to produce an increased surface li - abundance .",
    "however  other than thermohaline mixing ",
    "these models lack any description for why a given star begins to experience deep mixing , or why the frequency of stars undergoing deep mixing is so low . therefore , while the li production mechanism and the conditions required for it to occur are well - understood , there still exists a _ missing link _ in exactly what causes the extra mixing .",
    "the increasing number of stars known to host close - in giant planets ( `` hot jupiters '' ) provides a potential solution to the li - rich giant problem . in this framework",
    "two factors actually contribute towards the increase in surface li abundance : ( 1 ) the injection of a large planet provides a reservoir of primordial ( unburnt ) levels of lithium , and ( 2 ) deep mixing that is induced as the planet is dissipated throughout the convective envelope , bringing freshly produced li to the surface .",
    "@xcite first explored this scenario theoretically and showed that while the results are sensitive to the accretion rate and structure of the star , the accretion of a planet or brown dwarf star can produce the requisite surface li abundance and explain their frequency .",
    "however , this mechanism was invoked to reconcile the existence of li - rich giants across the rgb and the agb , which is not commensurate with the properties of close - in hot jupiters or their occurrence rates .",
    "exoplanet occurrence rates are correlated with the host star .",
    "for example , close - in giant planets form preferentially around metal - rich stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . indeed ,",
    "the frequency of metal - rich giant planets is well - represented as a log - linear function of the host star metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for fgk stars with near - solar metallicity ,",
    "the fraction of stars hosting close - in giant planets is approximately 8% , and decreases to 0.6% for stars of @xmath11 } = -0.5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the occurrence rate of close - in giant planets also appears to be a function of the evolutionary state of the host star .",
    "it is well - established that sub - giant stars have systematically higher giant planet occurrence rates when all orbital periods are considered .",
    "however , sub - giant stars are also found to have fewer close - in hot jupiters than main - sequence stars of the same metallicity @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable debate to explain the differing occurrence rates of close - in hot jupiters , including suggestions that stellar mass differences between the two populations is sufficient to explain the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "if the sub - giant stellar masses were considerably larger than those of main - sequence stars at the same metallicity , then one could imagine changes in the proto - planetary disk or dissipation timescales ( due to increased radiative pressure ) that could hamper the formation of close - in giant planets and reconcile the observations @xcite .",
    "the alternative scenario is that close - in giant planets become tidally destroyed as stars leave the main - sequence and the convective envelope increases",
    ". it would be difficult to unambiguously resolve these two possibilities ( difference in stellar masses or tidal destruction of hot jupiters ) using models of stellar evolution and planet formation , given the number of unknown variables .",
    "@xcite employed a novel approach to untangle this mystery using precise galactic space motions .",
    "their sample comprised main - sequence and sub - giant f- and g - type stars in the thin disk .",
    "thin disk stars form with a very cold velocity distribution because they grow from dense , turbulent gas in a highly dissipative process . over time",
    "the velocity distribution for a thin disk stellar population increases due to interactions between stars , molecular clouds and spiral waves . because massive stars spend very little time on the main - sequence ,",
    "there is only a short period for interactions to kinematically heat a population of massive stars .",
    "in contrast , solar - mass stars spend a long time on the main - sequence , allowing for plenty of interactions to kinematically heat the population . for these reasons",
    "one would expect the space velocity dispersion of thin disk stars to decrease with increasing stellar mass .",
    "this logic extends to evolved stars , since they only spend a small fraction as a sub - giant or giant relative to their main - sequence lifetime .    using precise parallaxes and proper motions from _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , @xcite find that the distribution of galactic space motions of planet - hosting sub - giant stars are on average equal to those of planet - hosting main - sequence stars .",
    "for this reason , the distribution of planet - hosting sub - giant and main - sequence stars can only differ in age ( or radius , as expected from the increasing stellar envelope ) , but not mass .",
    "moreover the orbital eccentricities of jupiters around sub - giants are systematically lower than those of main - sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that some level of angular momentum transfer and orbital circularisation has occurred .",
    "because the main - sequence and sub - giant planet - host stars are likely to only differ in age , they provide insight on what happens to close - in giant planets when a star s convective envelope deepens at the base of the giant branch . therefore the lack of close - in giant planets orbiting sub - giant stars provides clear evidence for their destruction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given this empirical evidence for tidal destruction of close - in hot jupiters as a star begins its ascent on the giant branch , it is intriguing to consider what impact the planet accretion would have on the host star .",
    "@xcite show that while the extent of observable signatures are sensitive to the mass of the planet and the accretion rate , the engulfment of a close - in giant planet can significantly increase the photospheric li abundance .",
    "recall that two factors contribute to this signature .",
    "firstly , the accreted mass of the giant planet  where no li burning has occurred  can produce a net increase in photospheric li .",
    "the second effect allows for li _ production _ within the star : the spiralling infall of a giant planet and the associated angular momentum transfer is sufficient to induce deep mixing , bringing freshly produced @xmath7li to the surface before it is destroyed .",
    "if the additional li reservoir were the only effect contributing to the net increase in photospheric li , then an order - of - magnitude estimate of the requisite planetary mass suggests a brown dwarf is required .",
    "however a brown dwarf will have a fully convective envelope , and will therefore have depleted some of its primordial li abundance .",
    "moreover , the lack of brown dwarfs found within 3 - 5  au around solar - mass stars ( @xmath311% ; the _  brown dwarf desert  _ , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that brown dwarfs are not frequent enough to later produce the higher frequency of li - rich giant stars . for these reasons li - rich giant stars are unlikely to be primarily produced from the ingestion of a brown dwarf , implying that the deep mixing induced by angular momentum transfer is crucial to produce high photospheric li abundances .",
    "moreover , without any additional mixing ( and just a reservoir of unburnt li ) we would expect a similar increase in be , which has not been detected in li - rich giant stars to date @xcite .    indeed , if we simply take the models of @xcite at face value and assume that _ some _ conditions of accretion rate can produce a net increase in photospheric li ( either through a fresh reservoir of li and induced deep mixing ) , then the observed occurrence rates of close - in giant planets _ predicts a population of li - rich giant stars before the rgb bump_. the occurrence rates of close - in giant planets at solar metallicity ( @xmath138% , or more conservatively @xmath131% , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is commensurate with the idea that some accretion conditions could produce a population of li - rich giant stars with a frequency of @xmath131% .",
    "if this scenario were true , the correlation between the occurrence rate of close - in giant planets and the host stellar metallicity suggests that we should expect to see more li - rich giant stars before the rgb bump with higher metallicities .",
    "although the lack of reproducible selection functions for studies of li - rich giant stars prevents us from commenting on the fraction of li - rich giants at a given metallicity , the observations are consistent with our expectations . indeed , like @xcite , we find that most of our li - rich giant stars have near - solar metallicities .",
    "however this observation may be complicated by the _ gaia - eso survey _  selection function , as the metallicity distribution function of _ gaia - eso survey _  stars peaks near solar metallicity for the uves sample in idr4 .",
    "contrary to the original motivation in @xcite , the planet engulfment model is actually less likely to produce li - rich stars all across the rgb and agb , because close - in giants are likely to be destroyed as soon as the convective envelope increases .",
    "although planets are found more frequently around sub - giant stars , those planets are preferentially found on long orbital periods .",
    "moreover , the timescale of li - depletion suggests that our proposed scenario is unlikely to account for highly evolved stars with increased li .",
    "as the planet is destroyed the subsequent li enhancement will be depleted over the next @xmath00.21  myr . because low - mass stars spend such a short time from the main - sequence to the sub - giant phase",
    ", we should expect any li enhancement to be depleted by the time they have ascended even moderately up the giant branch .",
    "alternatively , if a giant planet is formed sufficiently far from the host star it may be unaffected by the initial expansion of the convective envelope . in this scenario",
    "it may be accreted at a subsequent time , ultimately being destroyed when the star is more evolved .",
    "however the circularisation and long orbital periods of giant planets around sub - giant stars suggests that the long - timescale engulfment scenario is somewhat improbable @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one could imagine a somewhat unusual scenario where the planet is not fully dissolved , and orbits within the stellar photosphere without any large transfer of angular momentum . in principle",
    ", this kind of scenario may explain li - rich giant stars at more evolved stages .",
    "our assertion linking the majority of li - rich stars as a consequence of tidal destruction of close - in giant planets is unlikely to fully explain the existence of very metal - poor li - rich giants .",
    "the occurrence rates of close - in giant planets for stars with low metallicity ( @xmath11 } = -0.5 $ ] ) is a mere @xmath01% , and decreases with total metallicity .",
    "therefore , a very metal - poor star ( e.g. , @xmath11 } < -2 $ ] ) is quite unlikely to host any planet ( including a close - in giant planet ) , and therefore planet accretion is an improbable explanation for the increased surface li .",
    "however , of the li - rich stars that are also metal - poor , these are almost ubiquitously found to also be highly evolved ( e.g. , agb , rgb tip , red clump ) , which are thus explainable through a host of internal mechanisms .",
    "dynamical interactions would suggest that our proposed link between close - in giant planets and li - rich giants implies a lower fraction of li - rich giant stars should be found in dense stellar environments .",
    "three body interactions in a dense cluster can sufficiently perturb a close - in hot jupiter before a star leaves the main - sequence @xcite . while the evidence is weak , this appears to be consistent with the observations of li - rich giants",
    "( see section [ sec : frequency - discussion ] ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that spectroscopic studies of li - rich giants are systematically biased in their determination of surface gravities . indeed ,",
    "if the majority of li - rich giant stars are actually red clump stars that have been misclassified as stars below the bump , there may be little or no requirement for an external mechanism to induce additional mixing .    in their low - resolution study of @xmath32 low - mass giant stars , @xcite identified fifteen new li - rich stars and noted a concentration of them at the red clump , or on the rgb .",
    "either evolutionary state was plausible , as it is difficult to unambiguously determine the precise evolutionary state directly from spectroscopy . because the lifetime for clump stars is much longer than those at the bump , it is reasonable to expect that many field stars identified to be near the luminosity bump are indeed clump stars .",
    "moreover , stellar evolution models suggest that li can be synthesised during the he - core flash @xcite , suggesting that most li - rich giants may actually be red clump stars , and have been mis - identified as being near the luminosity bump .",
    "@xcite used asteroseismic data from the _ kepler _  space telescope and came to this conclusion for their metal - poor ( @xmath11 } = -0.29 $ ] ) li - rich star .",
    "although stellar parameters derived from spectroscopy alone were unable to confidently place their star on the rgb or at the clump , the internal oscillations for a star with or without a he - burning core show small differences @xcite .",
    "however @xcite showed that solar - like oscillations in kic 9821622 ( another li - rich giant star ) demonstrated that it does not have a he - burning core , and firmly places the evolutionary stage of kic 9821622 below the luminosity bump on the giant branch .",
    "our sample constitutes the largest number of li - rich giant stars identified in a field observed by a space telescope capable of detecting asteroseimic oscillations .",
    "although our stellar parameters are more consistent with the majority of these stars being on the rgb at or below the luminosity bump , they are each _ individually _ consistent with being red clump stars : the red clump position ( in @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) is 1-@xmath33 to 2-@xmath33 of the quoted uncertainty for each _ individual _ star .",
    "however as a coherent sample , the _ population _ significance depends on how correlated these measurements are . for these reasons , employing asteroseismic data from _ corot _  may reveal whether these stars are indeed red clump stars , or associated with the bump in the luminosity .",
    "if indeed it is the former , an external planet ingestion scenario becomes unlikely , which would provide strong direction on where to focus modelling efforts .",
    "we encourage follow - up work to distinguish these possibilities .      the selection function and observing strategy employed for the _ gaia - eso survey _  preclude us from robustly commenting on the frequency of li - rich giants for the milky way field population .",
    "all uves spectra include the 6707    li line , but the standard giraffe settings used for milky way _ survey _ fields ( hr10 and hr21 ) do not span this region .",
    "_ corot _",
    "observations within the _ gaia - eso survey _",
    "are a unique subset of high scientific interest , which is why the hr15n setup ( covering li ) was employed for these stars .",
    "therefore we can only comment on the frequency of li - enhanced ( a(li ) @xmath5 ) k - giant stars identified in the _ corot _  field , or the fraction observed in the larger uves sample .    at first glance",
    "the discovery of 9 li - rich giant stars in the _ corot _  field may appear as a statistically high number , suggesting there may be something special about the location of the _ corot _  field , or the distribution of stellar masses within it . the _ gaia - eso survey _",
    "idr4 contains 1,175 giant stars that match our selection criteria ( @xmath34 and @xmath35  k ) where the abundance of li is reported .",
    "we identify 9 li - rich giants , resulting in an observed frequency of slow rotating li - rich k giants of @xmath01% , consistent with previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the frequency in the total uves sample from the _ gaia - eso survey _",
    "idr4 is even smaller .",
    "the sample contains 992 giants that match our selection criteria , of which 845 have li abundance measurements or upper limits .",
    "four of these are li - rich , implying a frequency of just 0.4% .",
    "these are small - number statistics that may be strongly impacted by the _ survey _ selection function .",
    "for example , the uves sample contains a considerable fraction ( 27% ) of cluster stars . only about 50% of the sample are milky way fields , with the remainder comprised of bulge fields , benchmark stars , and radial velocity standards . the uves cluster sample ( open and globular ) contains 256 stars ,",
    "of which two are li - rich .",
    "it is of interest to speculate whether the occurrence rate of slow - rotating li - rich k giants differs between clusters and the field . while it is difficult for us to make robust inferences on the field frequency based on the literature or the idr4",
    "_ survey _ data set , it is important to note that the vast majority ( @xmath36% ) of li - rich giant stars _ have _ been discovered in the field . after accounting for the fact that star clusters have been extensively observed with multi - object spectroscopic instruments for over a decade , it seems curious that less than ten li - rich giant stars have been detected in globular clusters to date",
    ". however , we stress that standard instrumental setups do not always include the li line , so this line of argument is further complicated by observational ( or scientific ) biases .",
    "we have presented one of the largest samples of li - rich k - giant stars .",
    "our sample of li - rich giant stars includes the most li - rich giant known towards the bulge , and the first sample of li - rich giants towards the _ corot _  fields .",
    "most stars have stellar parameters and abundances that are consistent with being just below the luminosity bump on the red giant branch . given that about half of our sample is towards the _ corot _  fields , accurately knowing the evolutionary stage of this sample could confirm their position below the luminosity bump .",
    "the ensemble properties of li - rich giant stars in the literature suggest two sub - classes , which may point towards their formation mechanism(s ) .",
    "the first is comprised of near - solar ( @xmath11 } \\gtrsim -0.5 $ ] ) metallicity stars , which are preferentially found slightly before or near the luminosity bump . the second class of li - rich giants are found in later evolutionary stages and are usually more metal - poor .",
    "we argue that li - rich giant stars before or near the luminosity bump are a consequence of planet / brown dwarf engulfment when the stellar photosphere expands at the sub - giant stage .",
    "our assertion is supported by recent evidence on the occurrence rates of close - in giant planets , which demonstrate that hot jupiters are accreted onto the host star as they begin to ascend the giant branch .",
    "if we take planet accretion models at face value and trust that _ some _ conditions of accretion rate can produce a net positive abundance of li by amassing unburnt li _ and _ inducing deep mixing by angular momentum transfer , then these two lines of evidence actually _ predict the existence of li - rich giant stars_.    this scenario would predict an increasing frequency of li - rich giant stars with increasing metallicity , and the li - depletion timescales would suggest that these stars should be preferentially found below the rgb bump . moreover , it would imply a lower fraction of li - rich giant stars in dense stellar environments ( e.g. , clusters ) due to three body interactions .",
    "the majority of li - rich giant stars are consistent with these predictions .",
    "the remainder are mostly li - rich giant stars at late evolutionary stages , a fact that is reconcilable with internal mixing prescriptions , late - time engulfment , or mass - transfer from a binary companion .",
