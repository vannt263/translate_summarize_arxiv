    "one of the basic premises in the polymer physics is that the bonds connecting neighboring monomer units are uncorrelated beyond the persistent length along the chain @xcite .",
    "this property allows us to consider only a flexible chain as long as we are interested in large scale properties of a polymer chain that is much longer than its persistent length . in this sense , it was a little embarrassing to realize that there is actually a long range correlation in the bond orientation of a polymer chain , and that the bond - bond correlation function decays not exponentially but as the power law @xcite .",
    "the traditional picture for the bond - bond correlation is based on a simple calculation for the polymer with a fixed bond angle around freely rotating bonds . in this case",
    ", one can calculate the bond - bond correlation function explicitly to show the exponential decay with a persistent length @xcite .",
    "the existence of the long range correlation , however , has been pointed out @xcite , and it was demonstrated recently that the power law behavior is induced in the bond - bond correlation through the interaction between monomers separated by a long distance in the curvilinear coordinate along the chain @xcite .",
    "the power law in the bond - bond correlation holds not only for an excluded volume chain , but also for a chain in a melt and in a theta solvent , where a polymer chain is supposed to behave as an ideal chain @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed both by numerical simulations and by theoretical analyses .",
    "this deviation from the ideality of a chain in a melt has been seen also in the intramolecular structure factor .",
    "for the ideal chain , the structure factor decays as @xmath3 in the intermediate range , @xmath4 , where @xmath2 and @xmath5 are the gyration radius and the bond length , respectively .",
    "this @xmath3 decay comes from the fractal dimension of the ideal chain configuration .",
    "the intramolecular structure factor of the polymer chain in a melt has been studied numerically and theoretically , and it has been found that there exists a substantial deviation from the ideal chain behavior @xcite .    in this paper , we study the structure factor of a single polymer molecule in a theta solvent , that is another situation where a polymer chain is supposed to become ideal effectively . in a melt , the interaction between monomers is screened by the existence of other polymer chains , and the excluded volume effect is canceled exactly by the induced attraction due to the incompressibility of the system @xcite while the interaction in a theta solvent is being adjusted by some fine tuned external parameter , such as temperature , so that the excluded volume effect is compensated by the attractive part of the interaction . we study how this fine tuning of the parameter may affect on the virtual ideality of the structure factor .",
    "this paper is organized as follow .",
    "after quickly reviewing how the long range correlation comes into the bond - bond correlation in sec.2 , the model and the method of our simulations are described in sec.3 , and the simulations results are given in sec.4 .",
