    "@xmath178 is the number of convective elements , which we estimate to be of order 10 ( fig .",

    "the behaviour of the @xmath154 component shows a peculiarity inherent to an expansion in non - orthogonal modes : the approximation is not monotonous .",
    "another illustration is the fact that mode 6 and 7 have a large amplitude , see fig .  [",

    ", these models may be treated kinematically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the mode analysis presented in this study is applicable .",
    "however , a generalisation of our approach to models beyond the kinamatically stable regime would require to place velocity modes and magnetic field modes on equal footing @xcite and is therefore not easily feasible .",

    "this has been demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenmodeapp ] for modes 6 and 7 and is the reason for the non - monotonous series approximation ( [ eq : expb ] ) .",
    "the ambiguity of mode coefficients is a general problem inherent to most of the attempts to model dynamo action by amplitude equations .",

    ", we have applied the mode analysis developed by @xcite to a geodynamo model in the low rossby number regime .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations .",
    "the expansion of @xmath26 in dynamo modes may serve as a useful analytical tool to interpret numerical dynamo models .",
    "besides direct numerical simulations , low - order models have been successful in illustrating the possible interaction of large - scale modes of different symmetries in planetary cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the work presented here connects both approaches and allows for the possibility to compare predictions from low - order models with direct numerical simulations .",
    "ms is grateful for financial support from the anr magnet project .",
    "the computations have been carried out at the french national computing center cines .",
    "first of all , we note that relation ( [ eq : bior ] ) does not fix the normalisation of the dynamo modes : given a biorthogonal set @xmath181 we may construct others , viz . :",
    "@xmath182 , where the factor @xmath18 may depend on the mode number @xmath144 .",
    "these new sets also obey relation ( [ eq : bior ] ) .",
    "we choose to remove the remaining ambiguity , up to an overall phase factor @xmath183 , by imposing that @xmath184 ( no summation over @xmath144 ) .",
    "the middle relation follows as usual by integrating by parts .",
    "an immediate consequence of this normalisation is that @xmath185 ( no summation over @xmath144 ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath186 are all unity . to see this insert relation ( [ eq : expbi ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : normal ] ) and use the orthogonality of the decay modes .",
    "the normalisation ( [ eq : normal ] ) makes sense for two reasons .",
    "the first is that in the special case of self - adjoint modes we may choose @xmath187 , and then relation ( [ eq : normal ] ) follows automatically from ( [ eq : bior ] ) .",
    "the second reason is that , loosely speaking , dynamo modes with the same amplitude @xmath102 but excited alone , contain the same total magnetic energy .",
    "we shall now make this statement precise .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field may be written as @xmath188 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : expb ] ) .",
    "next , we insert twice relation ( [ eq : expbi ] ) , integrate over all space , and use the orthogonality of the decay modes .",
    "finally we apply relation ( [ eq : eedag ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath189 & &   \\label{eq : spectr1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression shows that if only one mode is excited at unit amplitude , @xmath190 and all other @xmath102 zero , then the total magnetic energy @xmath191 is also unity , independent of the mode number @xmath192 .",
    "now if the dynamo modes were self - adjoint , then eq .  ( [ eq : bior ] ) becomes @xmath193 . upon inserting again relation ( [ eq : expbi ] )",
    "we get @xmath194 , i.e. the matrix @xmath195 is now unitary . in that case",
    "the second term in ( [ eq : spectr1 ] ) drops out , and we are left with @xmath196 . and that leads straight away to a spectral interpretation of fig .",
    "[ fig : exlev ] , because the mode number scale on the horizontal axis can be converted into a wave number scale .",
    "but in general we are stuck with eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectr1 ] ) as a whole , and contributions to the magnetic energy remain stored in the nonzero mode overlaps @xmath197 .",
