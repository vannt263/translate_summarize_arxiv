    "the recent experimental realization of synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in ultracold gases of neutral atoms has stimulated much interest in these systems @xcite .",
    "as soc breaks the inversion symmetry and qualitatively changes the dispersion spectra , a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas can exhibit many intriguing properties .",
    "for example , in a non - interacting fermi gas with soc , the system may undergo lifshitz transition as the fermi surface is tuned @xcite . on the other hand , in an attractively interacting fermi gas with soc , either the topological superfluid state or the exotic nodal superfluid states related to similar phases in non - centrosymmetric superconducting materials can be stabilized , depending on the specific type of soc and the dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "so far , only an equal rashba and dresselhaus ( erd ) soc has been realized experimentally in a three - dimensional fermi gas @xcite , in which case there can be no topological superfluid states supporting majorana zero modes in the excitations @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out recently that in the presence of an effective transverse zeeman field , which can be implemented by tuning the parameters of the raman lasers generating the synthetic soc , exotic pairing states with finite center - of - mass ( com ) momentum are always more stable than a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing state with zero com momentum @xcite .",
    "the presence of these finite com momentum pairing states , known as fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states , is a direct consequence of pairing under soc and fermi surface asymmetry , which , in this case , is induced by the effective transverse zeeman field .",
    "apparently , the pairing mechanism of these states is quite general , and is _ different _ from that of the conventional fflo state , where the pairing takes place between particles on different fermi surfaces . indeed ,",
    "similar fflo states have been reported in many other related systems with various types of soc and in different dimensions @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the exotic fflo states in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi gas under erd soc and cross zeeman fields , thus extending our previous work @xcite . in particular , we identify novel nodal fflo states with topologically distinct gapless contours in momentum space .",
    "similar nodal fflo states in systems with different types of soc and dimensions have been reported recently , which further implies the generality of the pairing mechanism .",
    "we examine in detail the dispersion spectra , as well as the stability region of these nodal fflo states on the phase diagram .",
    "while the unique dispersion spectra could be measured via momentum - resolved radio - frequency spectroscopy , the phase transition between these nodal fflo states could be identified by measuring the thermodynamic properties , since the difference in the topology of the gapless contours should lead to different behaviors of low - energy excitations .",
    "we then calculate the phase structure and the number density distribution in a typical harmonic trapping potential under the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we show that under lda , the first - order phase transitions on the phase diagram show up as discontinuities in the density distribution .",
    "these discontinuities would become smooth in a realistic experimental setting , but signatures of the phase boundaries should still be observable experimentally , similar to those in a polarized fermi gas . the presence of these first - order phase boundaries on the phase diagram and in a trapping potential suggests the existence of phase - separated states in a uniform gas with a fixed total particle number . although soc mitigates the competition between polarization and pairing by mixing the spin components , for moderate soc strengths which roughly correspond to the experimental parameters , first - order phase transitions may still be observed experimentally .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "in this section , we analyze the properties of the thermodynamic potential for a two - dimensional ferm gas under erd soc and effective zeeman fields . while the zero - temperature thermodynamic potential has been derived in the previous section in terms of the quasi - particle dispersions on the mean - field level , it needs to be evaluated numerically , as , in general , the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) can not be diagonalized analytically . in fig .",

    "on the other hand , in the presence of a transverse field @xmath13 , it has been reported that the resulting fermi surface asymmetry , combined with the soc - induced single - band pairing , should lead to the stabilization of fflo pairing states with com antiparallel to the direction of the effective transverse field . to see this point",

    ". therefore , as @xmath13 is switched on , a pairing state with zero com momentum would be shifted onto the finite @xmath42 plane , and the bcs pairing state can no longer be the ground state of the system for finite @xmath13 .    as a conclusion of the analysis in this section",
    ", we see that the ground state is in general the result of the competition between various fflo states .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ td2 ] , where we show the contour of the thermodynamical potential in the plane of @xmath19@xmath37 .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that we have only analyzed above the possibility of an fflo state with the com momentum lying along the @xmath54-axis . as we will show later , an fflo state with com momentum in the @xmath55-axis",
    "can also be stabilized .",
    "with the understanding of the thermodynamic potential , we can now study the phase diagram of the system . as the first step , we fix the chemical potential @xmath9 and look for the global minimum of the thermodynamic potential in order to get the ground state of the system . with a given chemical potential , except for the first - order phase boundaries ,",
    "there is only one global minimum , hence the complication of phase separation can be avoided .",
    "we map out the typical phase diagrams in the @xmath8@xmath9 plane for @xmath24 [ fig .",
    "[ aerfa - miu](a ) ] and @xmath56 [ fig .",
    "[ aerfa - miu](b ) ] , where the traverse field is chosen as @xmath25 . under the local density approximation ( lda ) , the chemical potential decreases from the trap center to its edge .",
    "therefore , the typical phase structure in a trapping potential under lda can be directly identified from our phase diagram .",
    "consistent with our previous analysis , all pairing states on the phase diagram with zero com momentum are replaced by fflo states with finite com momentum .",
    "there are three qualitatively different classes of fflo states on the phase diagram : the fflo@xmath57 state , the fully gapped fflo state ( gfflo@xmath40 ) , and the various nodal fflo states ( nfflo@xmath40 ) .",
    "the fflo@xmath57 state is basically the conventional fflo state in two dimensions dressed by the erd soc .",
    "in fact , in the absence of soc , fflo states can be stabilized in a 2d polarized fermi gas over certain parameter regions . there , the rotational symmetry does not single out any particular direction for the pair com momentum . in the presence of the erd soc and",
    "cross zeeman fields , however , we find numerically that the anisotropy of the system favors a pairing state with com momentum perpendicular to the direction of soc .",
    "indeed , in these parameter regions , we note that the fflo state with com momentum along the direction of soc is metastable .    on the other hand , both the gfflo@xmath40 and",
    "the nodal fflo@xmath40 states can be understood as a shift of the local minima of the thermodynamic potential onto the finite @xmath42 plane induced by the transverse field . when this shift in phase space is not too large , most of the properties of the final fflo@xmath40 state are similar to those of the original pairing state with zero com momentum .",
    "for example , the phase boundary between the gfflo@xmath40 state and the nodal fflo@xmath40 states ( the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ aerfa - miu ] ) is similar to the phase boundary between the fully gapped superfluid state and the nodal superfluid state on the @xmath53 phase diagram ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the nodal fflo@xmath40 states along this continuous phase boundary either have two ( np1 ) or four ( np2 ) separate gapless points in momentum space , which are the counterparts to the two different nodal superfluid states in the absence of the transverse field .",
    "when the shift in phase space becomes larger , novel nodal fflo@xmath40 states with topologically different nodal structure in momentum space appear , resulting in a rich phase structure in the middle of the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ aerfa - miu ] .    to characterize these new nodal fflo@xmath40 states , we calculate their corresponding gapless contours in momentum space",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ tp](a - c ) ] . typically , we can have nodal fflo@xmath40 states with two ( ns1 ) or four ( ns2 ) separate gapless contours in momentum space .",
    "in addition , between the np2 and ns2 states , we also have a mixed region , where two disconnected gapless contours co - exist with two separate gapless points .",
    "we have also shown in fig . [",
    "tp](d - f ) the quasi - particle ( hole ) dispersion spectra of the ns1 , ns2 and the mixed states , respectively , which are consistent with the corresponding gapless contours in fig .",
    "[ tp](a - c ) . in principle",
    ", one may probe these dispersion spectra experimentally using momentum resolved radio - frequency spectroscopy , from which the topology of the momentum space gapless contours of the various nodal fflo@xmath40 states can be probed .",
    "finally , we note that as the system approaches the bcs limit , i.e. , as @xmath18 decreases , the stability region of the nodal fflo states , fflo@xmath57 included , increases dramatically ( see fig . [ aerfa - miu ] ) .",
    "@xmath58 plane for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "solid curves represent first order phase boundaries , dash - dotted curves represent continuous phase boundary between the fully gapped fflo state ( gfflo@xmath40 ) and various nodal fflo@xmath40 states , and dashed curves represent continuous phase boundaries between different nodal fflo@xmath40 states or the normal state .",

    "[ sec : thermo ] , the first - order phase boundaries originate from the existence of multiple local minima in the thermodynamic potential landscape .",
    "thus , by tuning through these boundaries , the number density of the ground state exhibits a discontinuous variation as jumping from one local minimum to another . as a consequence , for a uniform system with a fixed total particle density",
