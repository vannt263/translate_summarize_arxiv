    "elliptic flow is one of the key observables in understanding the early stages and the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "large elliptic flow signals have been observed at the top rhic energies in both au+au and cu+cu collisions  @xcite .",
    "these results have been understood in terms of the initial anisotropy in the collision region , best described by the participant eccentricity  @xcite , being preserved via an early thermalisation after the collision and the hydrodynamic expansion of the system with very little viscosity  @xcite .",
    "initial measurement of @xmath0 fluctuations appear to confirm this picture where the event - by - event fluctuations in the initial shape anisotropy , quantified by the participant eccentricity are translated to event - by - event fluctuations in the @xmath0 signal  @xcite .",
    "particle correlations other than flow  ( non - flow correlations ) such as hbt , resonance decays and jets can resemble correlations due to elliptic flow and can have various effects on different flow measurements . in particular , non - flow correlations can broaden the observed event - by - event @xmath0 distribution and could be mistaken for @xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "quantitative understanding of the effect of non - flow correlations on the observed @xmath0 fluctuations requires a measurement where the flow and non - flow correlations are completely disentangled . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new method of measuring the non - flow correlations which crucially relies on the large pseudo - rapidity coverage of the phobos octagon multiplicity detector .",
    "we present results on non - flow correlation strength and elliptic flow fluctuations corrected for non - flow correlations in au+au collisions at @xmath1  200  gev .",
    "we aim to measure the second fourier coefficient of two - particle angular correlations and separate contributions from flow and non - flow in this signal .",
    "flow and non - flow contributions can be separated with a detailed study of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath4 correlation function . to this end",
    "we define the two particle correlation function between particles from two @xmath2 windows centered at @xmath5 and @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the foreground distribution determined by taking hit pairs from the same event and @xmath9 is the background distribution constructed by randomly selecting particles from two different events with similar vertex position and centrality . in practice , the correlation function is calculated using the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , correcting for the effect of the particles produced due to the interactions with the detector .",
    "it can be shown that if the only correlations between particles are due to elliptic flow , the correlation function will take the form : @xmath10 . in general , both flow and non - flow effects",
    "are present and so we denote the second fourier coefficient of @xmath11 as @xmath12 . the seperate flow and non - flow contributions",
    "are denoted @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , such that : @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2sqr ] , @xmath16 is shown for a selected centrality range in au+au collisions at @xmath1  200  gev .",
    "the contribution of two different sources can be observed : a flow plateau , @xmath17 , which is seperable in @xmath5 and @xmath6 and a non - flow ridge along the diagonal @xmath18 .    at large pseudo - rapidity separations , i.e.@xmath19",
    ", we expect the non - flow component @xmath14 to be small and estimate it by a comparison of the fourier expansion of the @xmath4 correlations between data and hijing . from these studies",
    "we estimate roughly that the non - flow in data in this region is in the range 0 to 3.2 times the non - flow magnitude in hijing .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath14 for @xmath20 is the dominant source of error in the final magnitude of non - flow correlations .",
    "further studies are planned to improve the understanding of the non - flow magnitude in this region .    performing a separable fit of @xmath21 to @xmath22 in the region @xmath20 , where @xmath16 is measured in data and @xmath14",
    "is taken as @xmath23 times the magnitude in hijing , we can measure @xmath13 .",
    "the fit in the selected @xmath3 region can be used to extract the correlation magnitude due to flow , @xmath21 , in the whole pseudorapidity accceptance @xmath24 and @xmath25 . subtracting the correlations due",
    "to flow from @xmath16 we can calculate @xmath14 in all regions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if there are no true flow fluctuations , the measurement of event - by - event @xmath0 fluctuations will yield an rms width of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the average @xmath28 due to non - flow correlations over all particle pairs  @xcite .",
    "since the second fourier coefficient of @xmath11 is equal to @xmath29 , the @xmath30 defined above equals @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we can calculate @xmath27 by averaging @xmath14 , the non - flow component of @xmath30 for particles in the two windows centered at @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "averaging over all particle pairs gives : @xmath32 the expected relative fluctuations due to non - flow , @xmath33 is shown in comparison to the the total measured relative @xmath0 fluctuations in fig .",

[ eq : empir ] , we extract the corrected elliptic flow fluctuations , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : flowecc ] are @xmath38 at fixed values of @xmath39 obtained in mc glauber  @xcite and color glass condensate(cgc )  @xcite calculations .",
    "the 90% confidence level systematic errors for mc glauber calculations ( shown as a band in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowecc ] ) are estimated by varying glauber parameters as discussed in ref .",
    "the relative flow fluctuations are in agreement with participant eccentricity predictions calculated both with mc glauber and cgc type initial conditions over the full centrality range under study .",
    "the observed agreement suggests that the fluctuations of elliptic flow primarily reflect fluctuations in the initial state geometry and are not affected strongly by the latter stages of the collision .",
    "these results are therefore qualitatively consistent with a picture of the collision process in which the shape of the initial stage geometry follows the predictions of the participant eccentricity model and where the initial geometry is translated into the final state azimuthal particle distribution in a hydrodynamic expansion , leading to an event - by - event proportionality between the observed elliptic flow and the initial eccentricity .",
    "the results , however , do not allow us to distinguish between glauber and color glass condensate type initial conditions .",
    "in summary , we have presented the first measurement of elliptic flow fluctuations corrected for non - flow effects extracted independently from data in au+au collisions at @xmath1  200  gev . a significant non - flow correlation strength is observed .",
    "however , even after correcting for these correlations , the elliptic flow fluctuation signal is seen to be large with a relative magnitude of  25 - 50% .",
    "we show that the magnitude and centrality dependence of these fluctuations are in agreement with predictions for fluctuations of the initial shape of the collision region quantified by the participant eccentricity calculated with either glauber or color glass condensate type initial conditions .",
    "these results support conclusions from previous studies on the importance of geometric fluctuations of the initial collision region postulated to relate elliptic flow measurements in the cu+cu and au+au systems  @xcite .",
    "the initial geometry seems to drive the hydrodynamic evolution of the system , not only on average , but event - by - event .",
