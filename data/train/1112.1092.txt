    "the last decade has seen substantial progress in understanding how galaxies assemble their stars and central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "recent results almost all point to the same conclusion ; that the bulk of galaxy assembly occurred at @xmath4 , and that a significant fraction of it took place in obscured ` bursts ' of intense star formation and smbh accretion .",
    "indirect evidence for this comes from , for example , the stellar ages of low - redshift galaxies @xcite , the existence of evolved elliptical galaxies at high redshifts @xcite , and studies of stellar mass assembly over wide redshift ranges @xcite .",
    "direct evidence mostly comes from extragalactic infrared and millimetre imaging surveys , which find that the number density of ir - luminous galaxies increases dramatically with increasing redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that much of the growth period of smbhs was shrouded in dust @xcite .",
    "the importance of obscured starburst and agn activity in assembling galaxies suggests that the two phenomena may affect each other . a link between them",
    "is implied by , for example , the tight correlation between the mass of the smbh and both stellar bulge mass @xcite and dark matter halo mass @xcite , and the coeval presence of both starburst and agn activity in many ir - luminous systems at all redshifts ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "is an idea termed ` agn feedback ' .",
    "agn feedback is the exertion of influence of an smbh on kpc to mpc scales to curtail star formation in the host galaxy , and/or further accretion onto the smbh itself .",
    "this can occur in four ways .",
    "radiation from regions immediately local to the smbh can ( 1 ) heat gas in the ism so it can not collapse to form stars , and/or ( 2 ) radiatively drive gas out of the galaxy ( or , equivalently , stop it falling in from the igm ) , thus emptying the galaxy of fuel for further star formation .",
    "additionally , matter expelled from regions immediately local to the smbh can ( 3 ) heat gas in the ism , and/or ( 4 ) drive gas out of the galaxy via kinetic pressure .",
    "most discussions of agn feedback condense the four feedback mechanisms described above into two simplified paradigms ; ` quasar ' mode feedback and ` radio ' mode feedback .",
    "quasar mode feedback assumes that radiation from an accretion disk terminates star formation in the host galaxy , usually by coupling some fraction of the qso luminosity to kinetic energy injected into the ism .",
    "quasar mode feedback is thought to be short - term , acting for only the @xmath185 years over which the quasar is accreting rapidly .",
    "radio mode feedback on the other hand is assumed to occur via a relativistic jet that transfers momentum to the ism .",
    "radio mode feedback can occur over longer timescales ( @xmath186 years ) than quasar mode as it requires only a low accretion rate to produce jets sufficiently powerful to affect the ism .",
    "nevertheless , radio mode and quasar mode feedback are not mutually exclusive .",
    "+     +          +     +          +     +          +     +          +     +        .",
    "details are the same as for figure [ figexamplefits1].,width=294 ]    for individual galaxies , agn feedback is predicted to have a significant impact , both from analytic @xcite and numerical studies @xcite . for galaxy mergers ,",
    "quasar mode feedback is predicted to have a profound influence @xcite .",
    "models for the cosmological evolution of galaxies and clusters have incorporated one or both of these feedback paradigms , often with noticeable improvements in reproducing observations .",
    "these include semi - analytic models using quasar mode @xcite , radio mode @xcite , or both @xcite , and numerical models with quasar mode @xcite , or both forms of feedback @xcite .",
    "observationally , evidence for agn feedback is mounting .",
    "studies of early type galaxies suggest that some form of feedback may have terminated their star formation ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "far - ir observations have also found powerful , plausibly agn driven outflows in oh@xmath187 and co 1 - 0 @xcite in local ulirgs and qsos that could exhaust the fuel supply for star formation within @xmath18810@xmath189 years , while x - ray observations have found mildly relativistic outflows in radio - quiet and radio - loud agn , with an origin close to the smbh @xcite .",
    "further observations have provided indirect evidence for ` quasar mode ' feedback in some galaxies @xcite , and for radio - mode feedback in galaxies and clusters @xcite .",
    "controversies do , however , remain .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that there is no need for agn feedback to explain the bulge - smbh mass relation , @xcite suggest that only a small fraction of intermediate luminosity agn at @xmath190 can be undergoing galaxy - wide agn feedback , and @xcite find that there is no simple inverse relation between star formation rate and agn luminosity in x - ray selected agn .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the effectiveness of agn feedback may depend on the mode of star formation , since spatially compact , ` bulge ' star formation is likely easier to turn off than spatially extended , ` disk ' star formation .",
    "our group has been examining the role of agn feedback by looking at systems in which such feedback may be ongoing .",
    "to do so , we have been studying the ` felobal ' class of qsos @xcite , which comprise part of the broad absorption line ( bal ) qso population1549 , nv @xmath1911240 , siiv @xmath1911394  & ly@xmath192 . low ionization bal qsos ( lobals ) additionally show absorption in mgii @xmath1912799  and other lower ionization species .",
    "finally , the felobal qsos , in addition to showing all the absorption lines seen in lobals , also show weak absorption from any _ excited _ term of feii ( e.g. feii * @xmath1912400,2600 ) , & also feii @xmath1912750 , feiii @xmath1911895,1914,1926 .",
    "see e.g. @xcite . ] .",
    "we selected this population for three reasons .",
    "first , the uv absorption troughs are unambiguous signatures of radiatively driven outflows powered by an agn .",
    "they have velocities of up to 0.2@xmath193 , widths of at least a few thousand km s@xmath194 ) , and are usually very deep or black , implying high column densities moving at high velocities , which plausibly implies high mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "therefore , they can not be driven by even the most extreme starbursts .",
    "furthermore , in at least some felobal qsos the outflows may extend up to several kpc into the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "second , they are invariably reddened objects with high ir luminosities @xcite , and sometimes harbour intense starbursts @xcite , suggesting they may be a transition phase in the lifetime of an agn ( felobal features are also occasionally seen in ulirgs , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "third , recent results have shown that felobal qsos are much more common at @xmath195 than was originally thought , by up to a factor of ten @xcite .    in this paper , we compare the strengths of the agn - driven outflows to the luminosities of obscured star formation in a sample of 31 felobal qsos , selected purely on the basis of their rest - frame uv spectral properties .",
    "we combine data from the spitzer space telescope @xcite with data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , @xcite ) , and from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , @xcite ) in order to measure the luminosities of both obscured agn activity and star formation .",
    "we measure the strengths of the agn - driven outflows from the uv absorption troughs in the sdss spectra .",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology , with h@xmath196 = 70 km s@xmath194 mpc@xmath194 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 .",
    "we use the term `` ir luminosity '' to refer to the luminosity integrated over 1 - 1000@xmath199 m in the rest - frame .",
    "we quote luminosities in units of bolometric solar luminosities , where l@xmath200 watts .",
    "we aimed to select a sample of felobal qsos purely on the basis of their rest - frame uv spectral features .",
    "furthermore , since measuring bal properties is not straightforward ( see  [ discusssboutflow ] and @xcite ) we required the sample to have optical spectra from the same source , and bal measurements already in the literature .",
    "accordingly , we chose our sample from the sdss .",
    "we started with the six sdss objects in @xcite ( hereafter f07 ) , excluding iso j005645.1 - 273816 and lbqs 0059 - 2735 as neither lie within the sdss survey .",
    "these six objects were originally selected with the only constraint being that their redshifts satisfied @xmath201 .",
    "we then selected a further 25 felobal qsos from @xcite .",
    "we imposed the same upper redshift cut of @xmath202 to ensure that observed - frame 160@xmath199 m remains close to the peak of the far - ir emission for the ( monolithic ) dust temperatures of @xmath203k expected within @xmath204pc of an agn .",
    "we slightly reduced the lower redshift cut from the f07 sample to @xmath205 to ensure that the sdss spectra always contain the mg ii bal ( see  [ discstrengths ] ) .",
    "hence , the final sample comprises 31 objects .",
    "this sample should be a random subset of the felobal qso population between @xmath206 , with no selection on ir luminosity .",
    "the sample is listed in table [ tablesample ] .",

    "sdss j033810 is discussed in detail by @xcite ; in summary , it is not certain whether the bals in this object are real , or a phantom of a peculiarly shaped continuum .",
    "sdss j233646 on the other hand is clearly an felobal qso , but is in a binary system with a separation of @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the ir emission comes solely from the felobal qso ( object b in gregg et al ) , but it is probable , particularly at 24@xmath199 m , that there is contamination from the companion .",
    "two further objects are worth mentioning ; sdss j081312 & sdss j105748 .",
    "these two objects show absorption from feii but not feii * ; the feature originally identified as feii*@xmath1912600  was subsequently shown to be a blend of feii@xmath208 mnii@xmath209 and narrow mgii@xmath210  with an uncertain relation to the qso absorption .",
    "since the original definition of an felobal qso requires the detection of feii * @xcite , these two objects would not be formally classified as felobal qsos if extreme strictness was imposed .",
    "they do however both show feii absorption , so we treat them as felobal qsos .",
    "a description of the observations of the six objects from f07 can be found in that paper .",

    "m we used a shallower total exposure time of two 10 second cycles per source , sufficient to detect , at @xmath211 , a 0.5mjy source , since all the objects in f07 were strongly detected at 24@xmath199 m .",
    "we reduced the data using the mopex software provided by the spitzer science centre , which performs standard tasks such as image co - addition , sky and dark subtraction , and bias removal .",
    "we used the default mopex parameters for mips small field observations . to check the quality of our reduction we compared it to that from the automated pipeline and found them to be consistent to within a few percent .",
    "we measured fluxes in all three channels using two methods .",
    "for the observations in which the source was clearly detected - all the 24@xmath199 m data and about half of the 70@xmath199 m data - we used the apex package within mopex with the default parameters and prfs for point - source photometry . for the observations in which the source was weakly or not detected we found that prf fitting photometry was not suitable , so we used the sextractor package @xcite in aperture photometry mode , with point - source aperture corrections provided by the spitzer science center . for undetected sources we measured the flux within the aperture , and then subtracted the average background flux .",
    "we compared the results from apex prf fitting photometry and sextractor aperture photometry for the brighter sources , and found that they agreed to within a few percent , with no obvious systematic differences .",

    "we measure total ir luminosities , and the contributions to the total ir luminosities from star formation and agn activity , by fitting the optical through mips photometry for each object with radiative transfer models for agn and starbursts , following the methods in @xcite and f07 .",
    "we describe the models and the fitting methods in  [ subsmodels ] &  [ sectfitting ] .      for the agn models , we follow @xcite and use a tapered disk dust distribution , in which the disk thickness increases linearly with distance from the central source in the inner part of the disk but tapers off to a constant height in the outer part .",
    "the tapered disc models include a distribution of grain species and sizes , multiple scattering and a density distribution that follows @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the distance from the central source .",

    "these models have been successful in fitting the seds of several classes of agn , and ulirgs @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a grid of models with four discrete values for the equatorial 1000   optical depth ( 500 , 750 , 1000 , 1250 ) , three values for the ratio of outer to inner disc radii ( 20 , 60 , 100 ) and three values for the opening angle of the disc ( 30@xmath215 , 45@xmath215 and 60@xmath215 ) .",

    "for the starburst models , we combine the @xcite stellar population synthesis model with a radiative transfer code that includes the effect of small grains and pahs , the updated dust model of @xcite , and a simple evolutionary scheme for the molecular clouds that constitute the starburst .",
    "the model predicts the spectral energy distributions of starburst galaxies from the ultraviolet to the millimetre as a function of the age of the starburst and the initial optical depth of the molecular clouds .",
    "these models have been successfully used to fit the seds of several classes of star - forming galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as the ` fork ' diagram of @xcite @xcite . for comparison",
    ", other starburst models have been developed by @xcite .",
    "we fit all possible combinations of starburst plus agn models to the sdss through mips photometry of each object in order to extract starburst and agn luminosities .",
    "the models do not include a prescription for the broad absorption features in the rest - frame uv that arise from radiatively driven outflows , so we do not include the sdss spectra in the fits .",
    "we do not include photometry shortward of @xmath1880.35@xmath199 m in the rest - frame for the same reason ; this means that we do not use the @xmath217 photometry for any object , and in some cases do not use the @xmath218 band data either .",
    "we do however use photometry at rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath219m)@xmath220 ; while we are interested in starburst and agn luminosities at rest - frame 1 - 1000@xmath199 m , including these data limits which models are acceptable fits in the optical , and thus limits which models can be used to fit the ir data . for the mips data we fit to the measurements in all cases even if they are of low significance , or negative .",
    "we allowed the contribution from each component to vary from 0@xmath2 to @xmath221 to see if the ir emission was consistent with arising from a single origin .",
    "the model libraries span several free parameters (  [ subsmodels ] ) , but our data are not comprehensive enough to constrain all of them .",
    "therefore , we use the complete model libraries to determine only the range in total , starburst and agn luminosities that are consistent with the data .    the best - fit seds are presented in figures 1 - 6 . in most cases",
    "the models provide an excellent fit to the data .",
    "we obtain @xmath222 in 12/31 objects , and @xmath223 in 15/31 objects .",
    "the remaining four objects have @xmath224 .",
    "the most difficult points to fit are usually the near - ir and/or the two shorter wavelength wise bands , which are somewhat underpredicted in many cases . this could be due to the still preliminary wise photometric calibration , and/or the lack of a host galaxy contribution in our models , so we defer exploration of this until more comprehensive near - ir data are available , and the wise calibration is refined . in nearly all cases",
    "the @xmath225 m photometry is well fitted by the models , though in a few objects the fit is relatively poor at these wavelengths .",
    "this effect is most noticeable in objects 3 , 11 , and 24 , in which the 70@xmath199 m flux is significantly underpredicted .",
    "this could be due to an additional ` hot ' dust component or an extremely strong spectral feature that is not reproduced in the models .",
    "since the models still reproduce the slope and approximate normalization of the far - ir seds even for these objects , we consider the results to still be usable .    to extract the most probable total , agn and starburst luminosities for each object , and their confidence intervals , we first construct a discrete probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the total , agn and starburst luminosities of each source .",
    "we weight each fits contribution to the pdf by its @xmath226 value . from these pdfs",
    ", we then construct cumulative distribution functions , from which the most probable luminosities , and their confidence intervals , can be derived straightforwardly .",
    "ideally , we would show the pdfs for all objects .",
    "this would however be unwieldy , so , as an example of the method , we show the distribution of @xmath226 values and the total , starburst and agn pdfs for one object in figure [ figexamplepdf ] .",
    "in most cases the pdfs have a single peak and an approximately gaussian shape . in a few cases though there are minor secondary maxima , and/or the shape is non - gaussian .",
    "we therefore quote as the positive and negative errors the 90% confidence intervals .",
    "the luminosities , their confidence ranges and the @xmath226 values of the best fits are presented in table [ tableasandlirs ] .",
    "we find that felobal qsos are luminous in the ir .",
    "all of our sample have ( best - fit ) total ir luminosities ( l@xmath227 ) in excess of @xmath0l@xmath1 , with nine objects , or 29@xmath2 , exceeding @xmath228l@xmath1 .",
    "there is no other sample to which we can directly compare ours , since no sample matched to ours in optical continuum luminosity and redshift has been observed in the mid / far - ir .",
    "we do however find that felobal qsos are more ir - luminous than the palomar - green ( pg ) qsos in @xcite .",
    "instead , they appear to have comparable ir luminosities to the wider population of bal qsos @xcite , reddened qsos @xcite , the most ir - luminous members of the general qso population @xcite , and to ulirgs @xcite .",
    "the dominant power source behind the ir emission is , in most cases , agn activity .",
    "a pure agn is either the most likely power source , or consistent within the 90% confidence interval , for @xmath229 of the sample ( 11/31 objects ) .",
    "a starburst component is required ( at @xmath230 confidence ) for the remaining objects , but in only twelve of these objects is the starburst more luminous than @xmath0l@xmath1 , and in only three objects is the starburst more luminous than the agn . the mean agn contribution to the total ir luminosity",
    "is @xmath231 , comparable to that seen in local ulirgs with ` warm ' ir coloursm to iras 60@xmath199 m flux ratio is greater than 0.2 - this is usually interpreted as an agn supplying at least a plurality of the ir emission . ] , but lower than that seen in pg qsos @xcite .",
    "the spread in agn contribution to l@xmath227 is however wide , spanning 0.2 to 1.0 .",
    "we find a strong correlation between l@xmath227 and the agn ir luminosity ( l@xmath232 ) , with a spearman rank correlation cofficient of @xmath233 and a significance of deviation from zero of @xmath234 .",
    "we also find a correlation between l@xmath227 and starburst ir luminosity ( l@xmath235 ) , with @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",

    "finally , we find a weak anticorrelation between l@xmath232 and @xmath238 ( @xmath241 , @xmath242 , figure [ agnconttolir ] right ) .",

    "we now examine the ir emission from agn and starbursts in felobal qsos using a different approach .",
    "we use all the solutions from all the individual fits to construct a single pdf for the whole sample ( figure [ figmergedpdf ] ) . from this , we reach similar conclusions to those described above .",

    "starburst activity on the other hand is significantly less luminous ; we find that the starburst is fainter than @xmath0l@xmath1 in just over half ( @xmath244 ) of cases , and almost never exceeds @xmath228l@xmath1 ( table [ probabilities1 ] , first row ) .",
    "overall , we find compelling evidence from the ir properties of felobal qsos that they are , as a class , distinct from the general qso population .",
    "felobal qsos have higher ir luminosities and a smaller average agn fraction . instead , the ir properties of felobal qsos are consistent with those of the reddened & lobal qso populations .",
    "the relationship between felobal qsos and ulirgs is harder to discern .",
    "it has been suggested ( f07 ) that felobal qsos are , as a class , a ulirg - to - qso transition phase .",
    "there is one result from our study that supports this , namely that the mean agn fractional ir luminosity of felobal qsos is similar to that of ` warm ' ulirgs .",
    "conversely , if felobal qsos were such a transition phase then we may have expected a higher fraction of them to host luminous starbursts , up to @xmath18850@xmath2 if they represented the entirety of the starburst to agn transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "now , this fraction is an upper limit to what we might see , and such a high fraction with luminous starbursts is ( just ) consistent with the pdf in figure [ figmergedpdf ] .",
    "other evidence for this comes from the unusual mid - ir spectral shapes of felobal qsos in comparison to other ir - luminous qsos @xcite . from the results in this paper",
    "however , the scenarios that felobal qsos are ( a ) randomly drawn from the reddened qso population , and ( b ) a ulirg to qso transition phase , are both plausible . since the former scenario is simpler , we conclude that , while some fraction of reddened / ir - luminous qsos are almost certainly the endpoint of a ulirg - qso transition , we see no evidence in this paper that demands that felobal qsos are _ more _ likely to be such a transition stage than the ( presumably ) parent reddened qso population .",

    "the sdss optical spectra used here are however of low resolution , and usually contain bals only for one or two species .",
    "so , even attempting such calculations for our sample is futile .",
    "it is however plausible that the depth , width , and velocity offset of bals in a single species , as quantified in measures such as balnicity index and absorption index @xcite do scale with increasing outflow strength .",
    "so , we here use the properties of the mg ii bal features solely as an estimate of relative outflow strength within the sample .",

    "e.g. if a high @xmath238 meant that the mg ii troughs were _ observed _ to be weaker than they really are .",
    "the fourth is a selection bias , e.g. if qsos with strong bals _ and _ strong starbursts drop out of the initial sdss qso selection and were thus not included in @xcite .",

    "the second alternative has traditionally been considered unlikely , the argument being that for it to happen then the starburst would have to act near the origin of the outflow , but agn broad - line regions are around five orders of magnitude smaller than starburst regions .",
    "nevertheless , it is not completely implausible .",
    "one possible scenario is as follows .",
    "if the ism was initially dense and the smbh was initially small , then the smbh may not be at first capable of powering outflows that extend @xmath188kpc into the host galaxy , but as the density of the ism was reduced by the ongoing starburst ( which thus waned due to the reduction in fuel supply ) and the smbh grows , then large - scale outflows would subsequently appear .",
    "this is not a scenario we can test , but it would likely require a serendipitous conjunction of ism and smbh parameters , so we do not consider it further .",
    "the third possibility is one that we again can not test , so we can not formally discount the possibility of a very large population of ob stars acting to suppress the observed depth of the uv absorption troughs .",
    "conversely , the rest - frame uv spectra of starbursts in ulirgs reveal continua that are at least an order of magnitude too weak to provide this effect , and sometimes show absorption in the same species @xcite .",
    "the fourth possibility is also not testable , but the sdss is now turning up felobal qsos in large numbers , and the initial qso followup colour selections are fairly relaxed , so we do not consider this possibility likely either .",
    "the first alternative is however one that we can test , from which we propose that it is unlikely as well .",
    "the test is as follows .",
    "if it is the case that outflow strength is a proxy for agn luminosity , then we should see a bigger difference between the starburst contribution pdfs for subsamples divided by agn luminosity than between subsamples divided by absorption strength . in figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfracbylagn ]",
    "we show the starburst contribution pdfs for two subsamples divided by agn luminosity , one for objects with l@xmath279l@xmath1 and one for objects with l@xmath273l@xmath1 .",
    "qualitatively , the difference between the pdfs in figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfracbylagn ] is _ weaker _ than the difference between the pdfs divided by absorption strength in figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfrac ] . if we extract probabilities of obtaining the same starburst & agn luminosities , and starburst contributions as we did for the absorption strength subsets ( 4th & 5th rows of tables [ probabilities1 ] & [ probabilities2 ] ) then we see three interesting results .",
    "first , lower luminosity star formation is now more likely ( at @xmath317 ) to be seen in the _ lower _ luminosity agn subsample ( e.g. for p(l@xmath318l@xmath319 : the l@xmath273l@xmath1 subsample is @xmath275% while the l@xmath279l@xmath1 subsample is @xmath281% ) .",
    "second , we are more likely ( albeit only at just over 2@xmath5 ) to obtain a smaller starburst contribution by selecting high absorption strength systems than we are by selecting high agn luminosity systems ( e.g. for p(@xmath300 ) : the as@xmath267 km s@xmath194 subsample is @xmath307% while the l@xmath279l@xmath1 subsample is @xmath311% ) . in other words , we are more successful in finding systems with a large starburst contribution to the total ir emission by selecting on weak outflows than we are by selecting on low agn luminosity .",
    "third , the probabilities of a starburst contribution in excess of 25% ( or 50@xmath2 ) are statistically indistinguishable between the high and low agn luminosity subsamples , but are different at @xmath314 between the high and low absorption strength subsamples ( table [ probabilities2 ] ) .    overall therefore , we find that radiatively driven outflows from an agn with absorption strengths @xmath320 km s@xmath194 act to curtail star formation in their host galaxies .",
    "we also find that this effect is ( at least largely ) relative ; such outflows reduce the contribution from star formation to the total ir luminosity to less than @xmath321 .",
    "we also propose that the _ infrared _ luminosity of the agn is not a good proxy for the degree of agn feedback that is taking place . finally ,",
    "since the ir properties of our sample are consistent with being drawn randomly from the reddened qso population , we conclude that this is true generally for reddened qsos .",
    "these results are consistent with the idea that starburst and agn activity crudely correlate with each other in active galaxies - a more luminous starburst means we are more likely to see a luminous agn & previous work on ulirgs , see e.g. the luminosities in @xcite ] - but where we add that a radiatively driven outflow can curtail the relative luminosity of the starburst on much shorter timescales than the typical lifetimes of a starburst or agn .",
    "we conclude on a cautionary note .",
    "our results appear solid , but they are based on a small sample , which makes the errors difficult to estimate .",
    "we have used what we believe to be a robust error estimation method ( jack - knife resampling , tables [ probabilities1 ] & [ probabilities2 ] ) , but with only 31 objects we can not reliably measure the error function , since comprehensive resampling methods are not possible . moreover",
    ", we can not test the robustness of the adopted boundary for dividing the pdfs of as@xmath322 km s@xmath194 .",
    "this boundary was motivated by the analysis in  [ discoutirs ] , but we would ideally like to explore the consequences of varying this boundary by up to a few thousand km s@xmath194 in either direction .",
    "we did perform a basic test of this in the appendix , by adopting instead a boundary of as@xmath323 km s@xmath194 , but we do not consider this to be a robust assessment of how sensitive our results are to the choice of boundary",
    ". given the distribution of as@xmath247 values of our sample however , we can not perform more comprehensive tests .",
    "a similar argument applies to the choice of luminosity cut for dividing the agn pdfs in figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfracbylagn ] , and to the choice of template library used to model the luminosities ( since several alternatives are available , see  [ subsmodels ] ) . to explore these issues properly",
    "would require a sample at least a factor of two larger than that used here . aside from sample size",
    ", we would also like photometry longward of 200@xmath199 m so as to measure the emission from cold dust heated mainly by star formation , and higher quality optical spectra to resolve mgii kinematics and look at the absorption strengths of at least one other species .",
    "we have presented a sample of 31 felobal qsos from the sdss at @xmath206 .",
    "these qsos have broad , deep absorption troughs in their rest - frame uv spectra that are unambiguous signatures of radiatively driven outflows powered by an agn .",
    "previous work has suggested that felobal qsos are ir - luminous , and sometimes harbor star formation rates of up to a few thousand solar masses per year .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the agn - driven outflows can extend up to several kiloparsecs into the host galaxies .",
    "felobal qsos are thus ideal laboratories for studying the effects of radiatively - driven outflows from an agn on obscured star formation .",
    "we selected our sample purely on the basis of their rest - frame uv spectral properties , and assembled for them optical through far - ir photometry from the sdss , 2mass , ukidss , wise and spitzer .",
    "we then fit these data with radiative transfer models for the ir emission from agn and starbursts to extract best - fit agn and starburst ir luminosities .",
    "we then compared these luminosities to the strength of their outflows as inferred from the absorption properties of the mgii@xmath1912799  line in their sdss spectra .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 - felobal qsos are luminous in the ir .",
    "all of our sample have total ir luminosities in excess of @xmath0l@xmath1 .",
    "nearly one - third of the sample exceed @xmath228l@xmath1 .",
    "the dominant power source behind the ir emission is , in most cases , agn activity .",
    "a pure agn is either the most likely power source , or consistent within the 90% confidence interval , for eleven of the sample .",
    "a starburst component is required for the remaining objects , but in only twelve of these objects is the starburst more luminous than @xmath0l@xmath1 , and in only three objects is the starburst more luminous than the agn . the mean agn contribution to the total ir luminosity",
    "is @xmath231 .",
    "the spread in agn contribution to the total ir luminosity is however wide , spanning 0.2 to 1.0 .",
    "overall , the ir properties of felobal qsos appear consistent with those of the general red / dusty qso population .",
    "we do not however find convincing evidence that felobal qsos are more likely to be a ulirg to qso transition phase than the general red qso population .    2 - we find no convincing relationship between the strength of the outflows and the total ir luminosity , or between the strength of the outflows and either the starburst or agn luminosities .",
    "conversely , we find a clear relationship between the strength of the outflows and the contribution from star formation to the total ir luminosity .",
    "if we divide our sample in two at an outflow strength boundary of as@xmath322 km s@xmath194 and construct probability distribution functions for the starburst contribution for the two subsamples , then the low absorption strength subsample shows a higher chance of a higher starburst contribution than the sample as a whole , and a much higher chance of a higher starburst contribution than the high absorption strength subsample ( figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfrac ] ) .",
    "we quantify this by extracting the probabilities of obtaining starburst contributions to the total ir luminosity in excess of 25% ( table [ probabilities2 ] , rows 1 - 3 ) .",
    "we find , at @xmath314 significance , a higher chance of obtaining a starburst contribution in excess of @xmath295 in the low absorption strength sample compared to the high absorption strength sample .    3 - this anticorrelation between outflow strength and the contribution from star formation to the total ir luminosity",
    "is straightforwardly interpreted as the outflow from the agn curtailing star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "there are however several other ways that it could arise .",
    "the most obvious alternative is that stronger outflows reflect an increase in the ir emission from the agn , but have no effect on the starburst ; if this is the case then the starburst contribution would decline with stronger outflows , but without there being a direct relationship behind the decline . to test this possibility we divided our sample into two at an agn ir",
    "luminosity boundary of l@xmath273l@xmath1 and constructed probability distribution functions for the starburst contribution for these two subsamples ( figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfracbylagn ] ) .",
    "if it is the case that outflow strength is a proxy for agn luminosity , then we should see a bigger difference between these two pdfs than that seen between the pdfs in figure [ figmergedpdf_agnfrac ] .",
    "instead , the pdfs show a smaller difference . furthermore , we find that ( a ) we are ( marginally ) more successful in finding systems with a large starburst contribution to the total ir emission by selecting on weak outflows than we are by selecting on low agn luminosity , and ( b ) the probabilities of a starburst contribution in excess of 25% are statistically indistinguishable between the high and low agn luminosity subsamples , but are different at @xmath314 between the high and low absorption strength subsamples ( table [ probabilities2 ] ) .",
    "we considered several further alternative possibilities (  [ discinterp ] ) but did not find any of them convincing .",
    "4 - we therefore conclude that strong , radiatively driven outflows in felobal qsos can have a dramatic , negative effect on obscured star formation in their host galaxies .",
    "this is the most direct evidence yet obtained for quasar mode feedback in the qso population at high redshifts .",
    "we find that outflows with an absorption strength in mgii@xmath1912799  of greater than @xmath324 km s@xmath194 ( table [ absmeasures ] ) act to curtail luminous star formation in their host galaxies .",
    "we also find that this effect is at least largely relative ; the starburst luminosity is reduced to less than about 25% of the total luminosity .",
    "finally , we propose that the magnitude of this effect is not deducible from the ir luminosity of the agn .",

    "as described in  [ discstrengths ] , measuring the properties of bals is not straightforward .",
    "so , we here summarize the checks we performed to see if our results are robust against the choice and method of bal measurement .",
    "first , we check our measures by comparing them to the three independent measurements already in the literature ( @xcite , though we note that the different absorption strength measures used by these authors together with the evolving reduction of the sdss spectra means the samples in them are not identical ) .",
    "we obtain generally reasonable agreement ( figure [ figascomparisons ] ) .",
    "we conclude that our measurements of absorption strength are acceptable .",
    "we note though that the scatter in this figure is larger than the formal errors on the fits , by a factor of two or more in some cases .",
    "this likely reflects systematic uncertainties arising from continuum placement .",
    "we do not attempt to account for these systematics , or quote them , as they are difficult to estimate robustly .",
    "instead , we use our absorption strength measurements only to make comparisons to each other , where they should be reliable . as a consequence ,",
    "we do not quote individual errors on the fits ( which are usually of order @xmath325 km s@xmath194 ) as we feel these numbers are misleadingly small .",
    "next , we check whether the results in figure [ figabsvslir ] depend on the adopted parametrization of absorption strength . in figures",
    "[ figconschecka ] & [ figconscheckb ] we replot these figures with both a stricter and more relaxed definition of absorption strength ( as@xmath196 & as@xmath249 , see table [ absmeasures ] ) . in all cases",
    "we recover comparable results .",
    "it is interesting that the relation is slightly offset from zero in the bottom right panel of figure [ figconscheckb ] , perhaps suggesting that the anticorrelation is not driven by troughs much narrower than 2000 km s@xmath194 .",
    "we conclude that our results are reasonably robust to the choice of parametrization of absorption strength .",
    "lccccccc as@xmath291 km s@xmath194 & @xmath326% & @xmath327% & @xmath328% & @xmath329% & @xmath330% & @xmath331% & @xmath332% + as@xmath333 km s@xmath194 & @xmath334% & @xmath335% & @xmath336% & @xmath271% & @xmath337% & @xmath338% & @xmath339% + all @xcite & @xmath340% & @xmath341% & @xmath342% & @xmath339% & @xmath343% & @xmath344% & @xmath345% + as@xmath346 km s@xmath194 & @xmath347% & @xmath348% & @xmath349% & @xmath350% & @xmath351% & @xmath352% & @xmath353% + as@xmath354 km s@xmath194 & @xmath355% & @xmath356% & @xmath357% & @xmath271% & @xmath358% & @xmath359% & @xmath360%    finally , we check whether the results in  [ discoutirs ] depend on the method used to measure the absorption strengths . as our sample is small , we can not robustly test the effects of different techniques to measure absorption strength .",
    "we can however do two basic checks .",
    "first , we keep our as@xmath247 measurements , but change the boundary for the low vs high absorption strength samples from 3500 km s@xmath194 to 5000 km s@xmath194 .",
    "second , we substitute our as@xmath247 measurements with the as@xmath196 measurements for the same objects in @xcite , adjusting the boundary to as@xmath361 km s@xmath194 .",
    "since @xcite are more stringent about what constitutes a bal qso in comparison to @xcite ( from where we chose our sample ) , this is also a test on a smaller , ` golden ' sample .",
    "we plot the resulting pdfs for agn fractions in figure [ figpdfconscheck ] and present the confidences on luminosity ranges and agn fractions in table [ probabilitiesgib ] for both tests .",
    "we obtain the same results - an anticorrelation between absorption strength and fractional agn luminosity - at a similar degree of significance .",
    "we conclude that our result is robust against the method used to measure absorption strengths ."
