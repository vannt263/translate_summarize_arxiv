    "atomistic nucleation theory was developed in the sixties and seventies in response to the realization that critical nuclei of atomic dimensions are common in far from equilibrium thin film growth @xcite . during the past decade",
    "the subject has experienced a vigorous renaissance , driven by the invention of atomic scale imaging techniques as well as by the availability of realistic large scale simulations @xcite .",
    "while this has resulted in a wide range of new theoretical developments , the classical theory has stood the test of time remarkably well .",
    "this is surprising because classical nucleation theory relies , in the jargon of statistical mechanics , on an approximation of _ mean field _",
    "type , in the sense that it considers only the evolution of spatially averaged concentrations of the different surface species  adatoms and clusters  and thereby neglects effects of spatial correlations and fluctuations .",
    "it was recently pointed out that the classical theory manifestly fails in describing nucleation events on top of islands bounded by strong step edge barriers @xcite .",
    "the onset of _ second layer nucleation _ on top of the first layer islands is an important factor determining the growth mode and morphology of multilayer films .",
    "tersoff and coworkers @xcite developed a theory of second layer nucleation based on the classical mean field estimate @xmath4 for the rate @xmath5 of nucleation events on the island , in terms of the in - layer hopping rate @xmath6 , the island area @xmath7 , the adatom density @xmath8 and the size @xmath3 of the critical (= largest unstable ) cluster .",
    "in refs.@xcite it was shown that for @xmath9 , 2 the mean field estimate disagrees with microscopic considerations @xcite and computer simulations .",
    "the failure of mean field theory was qualitatively attributed to the small number of atoms typically present on the island , and the associated large fluctuations in the occupancy of the island .",
    "the question then arises whether mean field behavior may be recovered at larger values of the critical nucleus size , where nucleation necessarily involves a greater number of atoms , and thus fluctuation effects should be reduced .",
    "a partial answer to this question was provided in recent work by heinrichs , rottler and maass ( hrm ) @xcite .",
    "they distinguish between two different nucleation modes : in the _ fluctuation - dominated _ mode the mean number of adatoms on the island ( in the quasi - stationary state prior to nucleation ) is much smaller than the number @xmath0 required for nucleation , and therefore nucleation is a rare , large fluctuation , while in the _ mean field _ regime , which corresponds to the classical approach of @xcite , the mean number of adatoms exceeds @xmath0 .",
    "consistency considerations then show that second layer nucleation on top of first layer islands is fluctuation - dominated for @xmath10 and mean - field - like for @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper i elaborate on the observations of hrm , with the goal of further clarifying the role of fluctuations in second layer nucleation .",
    "i begin by rederiving the main results of hrm within the approach of @xcite , which relies on expressing the nucleation rate in terms of the basic time scales of the process . while less quantitative than the treatment of @xcite , this provides , perhaps , a somewhat more transparent and unified view .",
    "a simple , universal criterion for fluctuation - dominated second layer nucleation is found which involves the first layer island density exponent and the critical nucleus size ( eq.([genbound ] ) ) .",
    "i then extend the analysis to @xmath12-dimensional nucleation , finding the same general structure as in the two - dimensional case , but with a decreasing influence of fluctuations with increasing @xmath12 ; as a byproduct , i recover the expression for the one - dimensional first layer island density exponent recently derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , i generalize the theory of nucleation on top of multilayer mounds developed in @xcite to @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to the case of nucleation on first layer islands , here fluctuation - dominated and mean field like nucleation regimes are found to coexist for arbitrary values of @xmath3 .",
    "this illustrates that the importance of fluctuations depends crucially on the growth situation .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional island of fixed linear extension @xmath14 .",
    "atoms are deposited onto the island at rate @xmath15 , they migrate on the island with an in - layer hopping rate @xmath6 and descend from the island at the inter - layer hopping rate @xmath16 .",
    "the mean time interval between subsequent arrivals of atoms on the island is then @xmath17 and the mean residence time of an atom on the island in steady state is of the form @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are geometry - dependent constants .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of ( [ tau ] ) is of the order of the traversal time @xmath21 required for the atom to migrate across the island , while the second term describes the increase in the residence time due to the step edge barriers .",
    "the second term dominates if @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ehrlich - schwoebel length @xcite .    the stationary mean number of atoms on the island is given by @xmath24 @xcite , and hence the condition for the fluctuation - dominated mode of hrm reads @xmath25 it will turn out to be useful to write this in the form @xmath26 , where the flux scale @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 for given @xmath14 , @xmath6 and @xmath16 , eq.([fluct ] )",
    "can always be satisfied by making the flux sufficiently small .",
    "nucleation with a critical nucleus size @xmath3 is treated within the `` noninteracting particle model '' @xcite , in which the lifetimes of all unstable clusters are assumed comparable to the inverse hopping rate @xmath29 .",
    "then the third relevant time scale in the problem , in addition to ( [ deltat ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) , is given by the _ encounter time _",
    "@xmath30 required for the @xmath0 atoms to find each other on the island . in order of magnitude we have @xcite @xmath31 a simple derivation is given below in section [ dimension ] .    under the condition ( [ fluct ] ) , each nucleation event is uniquely associated with the deposition of the @xmath0th atom .",
    "the number of nucleation events per unit time can then be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the probability for a freshly deposited atom to participate in a nucleation event .",
    "the latter is generally of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the probability that @xmath3 atoms were present on the island prior to the arrival of the @xmath0th , and @xmath36 is the probability that the @xmath0 atoms encounter each other before one of them leaves the island again .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 is given by @xcite @xmath37 the encounter probability can be estimated as @xcite @xmath38 where for simplicity we have equated the residence time of the @xmath0 atoms with that of a single atom ( in fact the two differ by a factor @xmath0 ) . thus @xmath36 is of order unity for @xmath39 and of the order @xmath40 when @xmath41 .",
    "in the case @xmath9 the encounter time ( [ tauenc ] ) is of the same order as the traversal time @xmath42 , whereas the residence time ( [ tau ] ) is of the order of @xmath43 or larger .",
    "thus one always has @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath13 it is possible to have a transition from @xmath46 to @xmath47 with increasing island size .",
    "this obviously requires that @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 for small islands , and occurs at the characteristic length scale @xmath50 we note that this is small compared to the ehrlich - schwoebel length , and therefore the transition to _ encounter - limited _ nucleation occurs before the step edge barriers become irrelevant , in the sense that @xmath51 becomes of the same order as @xmath43 .    in the encounter - limited regime the expression ( [ omegadef ] ) agrees in order of magnitude with the mean field estimate ( [ mfnuc ] ) . to see this , note that the adatom density on the island is of order @xmath52 , and hence @xmath53 in this sense the mean field approach remains applicable also outside of its strict range of validity @xcite .",
    "we summarize the preceding considerations in the following three expressions for the fluctuation - dominated nucleation rate , which apply with increasing island size @xmath14 : @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 regime iii does not exist for @xmath9 . for @xmath13 , the encounter - limited regimes iii and iv extend also into the mean field realm , while regime ii occurs only in the fluctuation - dominated nucleation mode .",
    "note that eqs.([omega1 ] ) and ( [ omega2 ] ) correspond to the regimes ii and i identified in @xcite for @xmath57 .",
    "here we prefer to enumerate the regimes in accordance with hrm @xcite .",
    "their regime i will be dealt with below in section [ nonstat ] .",
    "while eqs.([omega1],[omega2],[omega3 ] ) provide , in the specified ranges of parameters , valid expressions for the nucleation rate on top of an island of given size , in their application to a specific growth situation additional consistency requirements arise @xcite : when a given expression for @xmath5 is used to compute the island size at which nucleation occurs , it has to be checked that this island size does indeed lie in the appropriate range .    in this section",
    "we derive the resulting scaling regimes for second layer nucleation in two dimensions . following earlier work @xcite",
    "we assume a population of equal sized first layer islands of density @xmath58 .",
    "the island size increases with time @xmath59 or coverage @xmath60 according to the growth law @xmath61 for a nucleation rate of the form @xmath62 the critical island size at which a second layer nucleus forms is then given by @xcite @xmath63 we further introduce the notation @xcite @xmath64 where usually @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the first layer island density is then of the order of @xmath67 which defines the island density exponent @xmath1 . in standard nucleation theory",
    "@xcite it is given by the expression @xmath68 at the moment we will however leave @xmath1 unspecified to allow for the possibility of different first layer nucleation mechanisms . generalizations of ( [ chiconv ] ) will be derived in section [ dimension ] .      inserting eqs.([omega1],[omega2],[omega3 ] ) into ( [ lc ] ) one obtains expressions for the critical island size of the general form @xcite @xmath69 where the exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74    consider first regime ii .",
    "consistency requires the inequalities @xmath75 and @xmath76 to be satisfied simultaneously , which implies @xmath77 since @xmath66 and @xmath65 , these inequalities can be satisfied only if the exponent of @xmath78 on the left hand side is smaller than the one on the right hand side . inserting the expressions ( [ exp1 ] )",
    "this is found to lead to the condition @xmath79 the analysis of regime iii , based on the requirement @xmath80 , yields the same condition ( [ genbound ] ) , while in regime iv the relevant inequalities @xmath81 translate into @xmath82    using the expression ( [ chiconv ] ) for @xmath1 , we see that the fluctuation - dominated regimes ii and iii become inconsistent at @xmath83 . for larger @xmath3",
    "regime iii survives in its mean field version , while regime ii disappears . in regime",
    "iv the transition from fluctuation - dominated to mean - field behavior occurs at @xmath84 ; in this regime the critical island size is of the order of the first layer island distance , @xmath85 , and hence the problem really reduces to that of first layer nucleation .",
    "the general form of the conditions ( [ genbound],[weakbound ] ) illustrates that the upper critical nucleus size , at which the mean - field nucleation mode sets it , is intimately linked to the expression for the first layer island density exponent .",
    "scenarios different from the standard case ( [ chiconv ] ) can arise if , due to e.g. metastable clusters @xcite or surface reconstruction @xcite , the critical nucleus on the substrate is smaller or larger than that on the island .",
    "another example of nonstandard behavior is kinetically limited first layer nucleation , where eq.([chiconv ] ) is replaced by @xcite @xmath86 and the upper critical nucleus sizes shift to @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in addition the growth law ( [ growth ] ) plays an important role , as will be discussed below .      for very strong step edge barriers",
    "the residence time @xmath51 becomes the largest time scale in the problem , and may effectively be set to infinity @xcite .",
    "in this situation all atoms deposited on the island remain there , and a stationary state where deposition and loss of adatoms compensate each other is never reached .",
    "a distinction between fluctuation - dominated and mean - field nucleation scenarios is nevertheless possible @xcite : in the first case nucleation occurs as soon as the @xmath0-th atom arrives on the island , while in the second case many more atoms have to be deposited .    using the growth law ( [ growth ] ) it is easy to show that the time required to deposit a few ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) atoms on the island is @xmath89 at this point the island size is of the order @xmath90 , corresponding to exponents @xmath91 for the fluctuation - dominated part of regime i. to see whether nucleation is actually fluctuation dominated , the time scale ( [ deptime ] ) is to be compared to the encounter time ( [ tauenc ] ) , evaluated at the island size @xmath90 ; fluctuation - dominated nucleation occurs if @xmath92 .",
    "once more this yields the condition ( [ genbound ] ) , which can therefore be regarded as a universal criterion for fluctuation - dominated second layer nucleation . for @xmath93 mean field theory can be used to compute the nucleation rate , and one arrives at the scaling exponents @xcite @xmath94 a graphical representation of the sequence of scaling regimes as a function of @xmath3 is provided in figure [ reg2d ] .",
    "while in the stationary nucleation regimes of section [ stat ] the criterion ( [ genbound ] ) appears in a rather indirect way , in the nonstationary case it has a straightforward interpretation in terms of a comparison of the time scales @xmath95 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is easily generalized to first layer island growth laws of the form @xmath96 which lead to @xmath97 instead of ( [ genbound ] ) .",
    "in statistical physics fluctuation effects are typically more prominent in low spatial dimensionalities . it is therefore of some interest to repeat the above considerations for growth of @xmath12-dimensional islands on a @xmath12-dimensional substrate .",
    "the residence time is then still given by an expression of the form ( [ tau ] ) , while the interarrival time becomes @xmath98 to estimate the encounter time , it is useful to visualize the trajectories of the @xmath0 diffusing adatoms in a configuration space of dimensionality @xmath99 , where the motion is restricted to a region of linear extent @xmath14 .",
    "nucleation occurs on a @xmath12-dimensional submanifold , the codimension of which is @xmath100 .",
    "we are thus dealing with a first passage problem in @xmath100 dimensions , where the encounter time plays the role of the mean first passage time .",
    "this implies that @xmath101 since the residence time is always at least equal to the traversal time @xmath42 , it follows that encounter - limited nucleation in the sense of @xmath102 is possible only for dimensionalities @xmath103 .",
    "this recovers the upper critical dimension @xmath104 for diffusion - limited reactions of @xmath0 particles @xcite .      as a warm - up excercise",
    "we derive here a formula for the exponent @xmath1 of the first layer island density valid for general @xmath12 .",
    "the appropriate expression for the nucleation rate is ( [ omega3 ] ) , which is now to be interpreted as the rate of nucleation in a region of size @xmath14 .",
    "the distance @xmath105 between first layer nuclei is determined by the condition that there should be one nucleation event per area @xmath106 during the monolayer deposition time @xmath107 , i.e. @xmath108 for @xmath109 this yields @xmath110 which agrees with ( [ chiconv ] ) for @xmath111 and with the expression @xmath112 derived by kallabis , krapivsky and wolf for @xmath113 , @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath115 we obtain instead @xmath116 this case is physically realized only for @xmath117 , where ( [ chi2 ] ) reduces to the well - known value @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "these results are easily generalized to the growth of islands of ( fractal or integer ) dimensionality @xmath119 on a @xmath12-dimensional substrate . in that case",
    "the time of interest is not the monolayer growth time @xmath107 , but rather the time required to cover a fraction of the substrate which is of order unity .",
    "while the true coverage is related to island density and island size through @xmath120 , the covered fraction of the @xmath12-dimensional substrate is @xmath121 . setting the inverse nucleation rate equal to the time in which @xmath122 is reached then yields the condition @xmath123 which for @xmath109 implies the island density exponent @xmath124 for @xmath125 , 2 this agrees with the general expression given in @xcite .      for compact @xmath12-dimensional first layer islands the growth law ( [ growth ] ) generalizes to @xmath126 and",
    "the critical island size for a nucleation rate of the form ( [ omega ] ) becomes @xmath127 using the expressions ( [ omega1],[omega2],[omega3 ] ) for the nucleation rates together with ( [ deltatd],[tencd ] ) and ( [ growthd ] ) it is then straightforward to repeat the considerations of section [ consistent ] . rather than developing in detail the general case",
    ", we focus here on the transition between fluctuation - dominated and mean field nucleation regimes .",
    "the analysis is most transparent in the nonstationary case .",
    "one finds that the deposition time is given by ( [ deptime ] ) for all @xmath12 , and the critical island size for second layer nucleation is @xmath128 using this to evaluate the encounter time ( [ tauenc ] ) , it turns out that nucleation is always fluctuation - dominated for @xmath115 , while for @xmath109 the condition for the fluctuation - dominated regime is again given by the universal relation ( [ genbound ] ) .",
    "the same relation also governs the disappearance of the fluctuation - dominated regime ii for general @xmath12 .    setting the island density exponent ( [ chi1 ] ) equal to @xmath129 then yields the expression @xmath130 for the upper critical nucleus size at which the fluctuation - dominated regimes i / fl , ii and iii / fl disappear .",
    "this is a decreasing function of @xmath12 which approaches @xmath131 for @xmath132 .",
    "as expected , the fluctuation - dominated regime becomes smaller in higher dimensions .    to analyse the transition to mean field nucleation in regime iv we use the fact that the critical island size for second layer nucleation is of the order of the first layer island spacing , i.e. @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the condition for fluctuation - dominated nucleation therefore simply reads @xmath135 , or @xmath136 .",
    "this clearly always holds for the expression ( [ chi2 ] ) , while for ( [ chi1 ] ) it is true provided @xmath137 with @xmath138 again @xmath139 for @xmath132 , and @xmath140 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the expressions for the scaling exponents @xmath71 and @xmath70 in the remaining regimes read @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 the scaling regimes for the one - dimensional case are shown in figure [ reg1d ] .",
    "the upper critical nucleus sizes are @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "in multilayer growth , the suppression of interlayer transport leads to the formation of pyramidal mounds @xcite . for strong step edge barriers , in the sense that @xmath146 exceeds the distance @xmath147 between first layer islands , the mound separation is set by @xmath147 and remains constant during growth @xcite . in this growth regime",
    "the mounds are wedding - cake - like stacks of islands upon islands , with a characteristic up - down - asymmetry : while the valleys between mounds are deep crevices , at the hilltops flat terraces of a characteristic size @xmath148 are found @xcite .",
    "@xmath149 is determined by the nucleation rate on the top terrace through the requirement that on average one nucleation event should occur during the growth of a monolayer , so that @xcite @xmath150 for a nucleation rate of the general form ( [ omega ] ) this implies @xmath151 a more precise calculation the factor of proportionality can be found in @xcite .    as in the case of second layer nucleation ,",
    "application of the expressions ( [ omega1 ] , [ omega2 ] , [ omega3 ] ) for the nucleation rate yields estimates for the top terrace size of the form @xmath152 where the scaling exponents @xmath153 and @xmath154 depend on @xmath3 and on the scaling regime in question .",
    "inspection shows that the equivalent of the nonstationary regime i discussed above in section [ nonstat ] is trivial in the case of mound growth : when @xmath155 , the top terrace size becomes comparable to the lattice constant , @xmath156 , corresponding to pure statistical poisson growth @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - dominated regime ii with scaling exponents @xmath157 covers the parameter range @xmath158 , where @xmath159 for all @xmath3 . in marked contrast to second layer nucleation , here regime ii exists for all @xmath3 .    for @xmath160 nucleation",
    "is governed by the exponents of regime iii , @xmath161 this regime is fluctuation - dominated for @xmath162 , while for @xmath114 it splits up into fluctuation - dominated and mean field - like subregimes with identical scaling exponents .",
    "both subregimes exist for all @xmath114 , though the fluctuation - dominated part becomes very small for large @xmath3 . for",
    "@xmath163 one enters the regime of weak step edge barriers , where @xmath164 and the shape and evolution of the mound morphology are qualitatively different from the wedding - cake regime discussed here @xcite .",
    "a pictorial representation of the scaling regimes is given in figure [ moundreg ] .",
    "the goal of this paper has been to extend the analysis of @xcite to arbitrary critical nucleus sizes , as well as to clarify the relationship between the recent stochastic approaches to second layer nucleation @xcite and the earlier mean field theory of ref.@xcite . the essential new ingredient that enters",
    "the problem for @xmath13 is the encounter time @xmath30 , which may become larger than the residence time @xmath51 .",
    "the mean field approach is valid , at least as far as the values of scaling exponents are concerned , when @xmath165 , but it fails when @xmath166 .",
    "apart from recovering the results of @xcite , the analysis has revealed a remarkably simple and universal criterion for fluctuation - dominated second layer nucleation , eq.([genbound ] ) , which may be useful in situations where nucleation is governed by different mechanisms in the first and second layer .",
    "furthermore i have verified the expectation that fluctuation - dominated nucleation should be more prominent in low dimensionalities , and i have shown that no upper critical nucleus size ( beyond which fluctuations can be neglected ) exists for nucleation on the top terrace of a mound .",
