    "much of the increasingly vast amount of data available in the modern day exhibits nontrivial underlying structure that does not fit within classical notions of signal processing .",
    "the theory of graph signal processing has been proposed for treating data with relationships and interactions best described by complex networks . within this framework , signals manifest as functions on the nodes of a network .",
    "the shift operator used to analyze these signals is provided by a matrix related to the network structure , such as the adjacency matrix , laplacian matrix , or normalized versions thereof @xcite@xcite .",
    "decomposition of a signal according to a basis of eigenvectors of the shift operator serves a role similar to that of the fourier transform in classical signal processing @xcite . in this context ,",
    "multiplication by polynomial functions of the chosen shift operator matrix performs shift invariant filtering @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the shift operator matrix play the role of graph frequencies and are important in the design and analysis of graph signals and graph filters . if @xmath1 is a diagonalizable graph shift operator matrix with eigenvalue @xmath2 for eigenvector @xmath3 such that @xmath4 and , for example , if a filter is implemented on the network as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a polynomial , then @xmath5 has corresponding eigenvalue @xmath7 for @xmath3 by simultaneous diagonalizability of powers of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the framework of graph signal processing regards @xmath7 as the frequency response of the filter @xcite .",
    "hence , knowledge of the eigenvalues of @xmath1 informs the design of the filter @xmath6 when the eigenvalues of @xmath5 should satisfy desired properties .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvalues relate to a notion of signal complexity known as the signal total variation , which has several slightly different definitions depending on context @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . for purposes of motivation , taking the shift operator to be the row - normalized adjacency matrix @xmath8 , define the @xmath9 total variation of the signal @xmath10 as @xmath11 which sums over all network nodes the @xmath12th power of the absolute difference between the value of the signal @xmath10 at each node and the average of the value of @xmath10 at neighboring nodes @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath3 is a normalized eigenvector of the row - normalized laplacian @xmath13 with eigenvalue @xmath2 , @xmath3 has total variation @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenvectors that have higher total variation can be viewed as more complex signal components in much the same way that classical signal processing views higher frequency complex exponentials .    as an application ,",
    "consider a connected , undirected network on @xmath15 nodes with normalized laplacian @xmath13 with the goal of achieving distributed average consensus via a graph filter .",
    "for such a network , there is a simple laplacian eigenvalue @xmath16 corresponding to the averaging eigenvector @xmath17 and other eigenvalues @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "any filter @xmath6 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath19 will asymptotically transform an initial signal @xmath22 with average @xmath23 to the average consensus signal @xmath24 upon iterative application @xcite . if the eigenvalues @xmath25 for @xmath19 are known , consensus can be achieved in finite time by selecting @xmath6 to be the unique polynomial of degree @xmath26 with @xmath20 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "note that the averaging eigenvector has total variation @xmath28 by the above definition and that all other , more complex eigenvectors are completely removed by the filter .",
    "thus , a finite time consensus filter represents the most extreme version of a non - trivial lowpass filter . with polynomial filters of smaller fixed degree @xmath29 , knowledge of the eigenvalues",
    "can be used to design filters of a given length for optimal consensus convergence rate , which is given by @xmath30 as studied in @xcite .",
    "this can also be attempted in situations in which the graph is a random variable , leading to uncertainty in the eigenvalues .",
    "for example , @xcite also proposes two methods to accomplish this for certain random switching network models .",
    "one relies on the eigenvalues of the expected iteration matrix .",
    "the other attempts to filter over a wide range of possible eigenvalues without taking the model into account .",
    "neither takes into account any information about how the eigenvalue distribution spreads .",
    "this type of information could be relevant to graph filter design , especially when the network does not switch too often relative to the filter length , rendering static random analysis applicable .",

    "the empirical spectral distributions are , themselves , function - valued random variables . often , it is not possible to know the joint distribution of the eigenvalues , but the behavior of the empirical spectral distribution can be described asymptotically .",
    "for instance , the empirical spectral distributions of wigner matrices converge to the integral of a semicircle asymptotically in the matrix size as described by wigner s semicircle law @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "a limiting distribution may or may not exist , but a sequence of deterministic functions can still approximate the empirical spectral distribution @xcite . the stochastic canonical equation techniques of girko detailed in @xcite , which allow analysis of matrices with independent but non - identically distributed elements as necessary when studying the adjacency matrices of many random graph models , provide a method to obtain such deterministic equivalents .     with some node tuples labeled .",
