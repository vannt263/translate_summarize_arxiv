    "am her systems ( polars ) are semidetached binaries that consist of strongly magnetic white dwarf ( wd ) primaries and red dwarf ( rd ) secondaries .",
    "polars were first recognized in 1976 with the discovery of circular polarization in am her ( tapia 1976 , 1977 ) .",
    "magnetic fields play a crucial role in determining the system s parameters .",
    "the field strength of the primary is so high that the material flowing from the companion does not form an accretion disk around the wd , but is guided along the field lines to an accretion column that forms near the magnetic pole of the primary .",
    "the flux distribution from the column consists of hard x - ray bremsstrahlung , an approximately blackbody spectrum in the uv and soft x - ray and cyclotron emission , which is the primary source of optical radiation .    the brightest polar am herculis ( rx j1816.2 + 4952 @xmath4 euve j1816 + 49.8 @xmath4",
    "3u 1809 + 50 @xmath4 h 1816 + 49 ) was classified as a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) by berg & duthie ( 1977 ) .",
    "it is not an eclipsing binary despite the observed large - amplitude minima in the light curves .",
    "the system has been studied for different wavelengths .",
    "each study revealed different characteristics of the polar .",
    "the system shows long - term , non - periodic variations where the brightness of the system varies by about 2 mag ( see , hessman , 2000 ) , known as high and low states .",
    "high and low states of polars are thought to be due to the variation in the mass transfer rate from the rd to the wd . in a recent study on the high and low states of the system by wu &",
    "kiss ( 2008 ) it was found that the magnetic field of the primary is a crucial parameter in regulating these states .",
    "previously , livio & pringle ( 1994 ) explained the observed low state of the system with the starspots migrating under the inner lagrangian point ( l1 ) .        .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)[f1 ]        observational properties of polars generally depend on the observed state and wavelength .",
    "for instance , short - term , low - amplitude variations in the x - ray / optical bands , known as flickering , are detected when the system is in high and intermediate states ( king , 1989 ; bonnet - bidaud et al . 1991 ) .",
    "different mechanisms have been suggested to explain these variations .",
    "szkody & margon ( 1980 ) , using the cross - correlation functions of high state observations of am her , reported the strong correlation in johnson u , v , and @xmath54686 features and discussed the ionizing radiation as a responsible mechanism for the observed small - amplitude brightness variations .",
    "another mechanism is the oscillation of the magnetic flux tubes ( tuohy et al .",
    "larsson ( 1988 ) , on the other hand , proposed an oscillatory shock height model to explain optical variations with periods , of a few seconds .",
    "king ( 1989 ) discussed that x - ray irradiation of the accretion flow below the l1 point produces oscillating ionization fronts .",
    "these ionization fronts modulate the accretion rate through l1 .",
    "the timescale of these oscillations is the dynamical timescale near the l1 , point which is about 8 minutes for am her . besides the high state",
    ", the low state of the system has also been the subject of interest because of its physical properties and the poorly defined characteristics that can change over time .",
    "complex and unpredictable observational properties of polars prompted us to obtain long - term optical variation of am her . studying the light variations obtained over a long period of time",
    "is necessary to see the complex structure .",
    "the study of am her was carried out with the 1.5 m rtt150 and rotse iiid ( robotic optical transient search experiment - iiid ) telescopes of the tbitak national observatory ( tug ) .",
    "the results are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we analyze the observations and discuss them in section 4 .",
    "optical photometry of the system was obtained using the russian ",
    "turkish 1.5 m telescope ( rtt150 ) over 19 nights between the period 2003 - 2007 ( table  [ amhertab1 ] ) .",
    "all the images were obtained using the andor ccd .",
    "the andor ccd camera is equipped with a set of cousins ( r@xmath6 , i@xmath6 ) and johnson ( @xmath7 ) filters . during the data reduction",
    "a few comparison and check stars were chosen in the same ccd frame including gsc  3533  1026 and gsc  3533  1021 .",
    "all ccd reductions were done with the iraf package . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the times of rtt150 and rotse iiid observations are indicated by vertical lines with the optical light curve of am her from the data of the american association of var , able star observers ( aavso ) .",
    "light variations of am her , obtained with rtt150 , over long periods of time show that the light - variation amplitude changes over time .",
    "the light curves , in fig .  [ f2 ] , are plotted as a function of the julian date ( jd ) to make clear any possible variation between successive orbital phases ( see , kalomeni et al .",
