    "the hypothesis that elliptical galaxies may be formed from the merging of two disk galaxies was first proposed by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) .",
    "it is now known to be an essential part of galaxy formation , but there are few merging systems close enough to be studied in depth .",
    "the merger - remnant systems ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 are the proto - typical products of major disk - disk merging , at the end of the merger evolutionary sequence ( read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "their nuclei have already coalesced , and their optical surface brightness profiles are close to the r@xmath8 de vaucouleurs law seen in typical elliptical galaxies ( schweizer 1996 ; 1982 )",
    ". however , they are not yet fully relaxed , and still display the disturbed morphology of post - merger objects , with tails and loops , which are the classic signature of equal - mass mergers ( figure [ opt ] ) .",
    "these two objects are nearby , and have been well - studied across a range of wavelengths .",
    "however it is only with the recent advent of _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  that it has become possible to study their x - ray emission in any detail .",
    "our _ xmm - newton _  observations , and in the case of ngc 7252 , archival _ chandra _  data , in addition to the existing multi - wavelength observations , therefore provide a new opportunity to study the x - ray emission - from both extended and point - like sources - arising in post - merger , proto - elliptical galaxies .",
    "ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 have different physical properties ( see table [ props ] ) , most likely as a result of their different post - merger ages , which are @xmath00.7 and @xmath01.0 gyr respectively ( schweizer 1996 ; hibbard & mihos 1995 ) and differences in their parent galaxies .",
    "ngc 3921 is believed to be the product of a gas - poor@xmath9gas - rich , sa@xmath9sc ( or s0@xmath9sc ) merger ( hibbard & van gorkom , 1996 ) , whereas ngc 7252 is the product of gas - rich@xmath9gas - rich , sc@xmath9sc merger ( hibbard et al .",
    "1994 ) . as ngc 7252",
    "is more evolved than ngc 3921 , its optical emission is more relaxed and symmetrical .",
    "the gas - rich nature of its progenitor galaxies has induced a vehement starburst , with more luminous young globular clusters arising from this starburst than are seen in the gas - poor@xmath9gas - rich merger remnant ngc 3921 ( see table [ props ] ) . these galaxies offer us an ideal laboratory to investigate how the different merger histories and merger ages of these galaxies are reflected in their x - ray emission .",
    "hence , we investigate both the extended hot diffuse gas components and x - ray point source ( xrp ) populations in these galaxies .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      read and ponman ( 1998 ) , in a study of the x - ray evolution of on - going mergers using rosat data , find that the late stages of mergers are under - luminous in x - rays compared with typical ellipticals .",
    "although when the two nuclei coalesce , massive extensions of hot gas are observed ( up to 10@xmath10 , e.g. in the antennae , arp 220 , ngc 2623 ) , after this peak , the x - ray luminosity decreases .",
    "in fact , in post - merger remnants , l@xmath5  / l@xmath11 is @xmath0 5 times less than that of a typical elliptical ( e.g. fabbiano et al .",
    "if major mergers are indeed the progenitors of normal elliptical galaxies , the x - ray halo must be in some way regenerated following the merging incident .",
    "in this section , we use our _ xmm - newton _  observations to investigate possible mechanisms for the regeneration of x - ray haloes in ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 .",
    "as we have outlined in the introduction , there are three hypotheses proposed for rebuilding the hot halo : the infall of tidally stripped cold gas , mass loss from strong stellar winds , and the return of hot gas expelled earlier in the merging process .      the hi gas in the two merger remnants is clearly associated with the debris from their gas - rich parent - galaxies , i.e. the tails and western loop in ngc 7252 and the southern tail in ngc 3921 .",
    "hi gas is not , however , seen to the north of ngc 3921 ( m@xmath12/l@xmath13 0.02 / , hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .    in ngc 7252 ,",
    "the hi gas is not obviously associated with x - ray emission . in ngc 3921 ,",
    "the picture is somewhat different .",
    "the extremely luminous source to the south of the nucleus ( 3921-x2 ) is clearly associated with the hi tail , h@xmath14 emission and a large group of star clusters , suggesting that it is related to recent star formation .",
    "the spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _  is not sufficient to determine whether this source is point - like , and the possibility that this source is not an x - ray binary but a local region of shock - heated diffuse gas can not be dismissed on the basis of the spatial data .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the region is being shock - heated via winds from close - by stellar clusters ; although these can reach temperatures @xmath7 2 kev ( the temperature of the best fitting mekal model to 3921-x2 ) , their x - ray luminosities are several orders of magnitude lower ( @xmath15 10@xmath16 ergs@xmath2 ) than in 3921-x2 ( e.g. stevens & hartwell 2003 ) .",
    "the possibility that 3921-x2 is a shock region due to the infall of cold gas still remains .",
    "however , we can estimate the upper limit to the post - shock temperature , and compare this with the temperature of the best - fitting mekal model of this source . from cavaliere et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : @xmath17 where kt@xmath18 is the pre - shock temperature , kt@xmath19 is the post - shock temperature , m@xmath20 is the proton mass , and @xmath21 is the pre - shock velocity of the infalling cold gas . the upper limit of the gas velocity is the velocity it would gain from falling into the galaxy from rest at infinity .",
    "we take the dynamical mass of the galaxy to be 1.06x10@xmath22  ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) , and assume the pre - shock cold gas temperature is negligible .",
    "putting these assumptions into equation 2 , we estimate the upper limit of the post - shock temperature to be @xmath00.96 kev ( @xmath010@xmath23k ) .",
    "this is well below the lower limit of the best - fitting mekal model ( 1.94 kev ) , and suggests that shocked gas is not the origin of 3921-x2 .",
    "however , it should be noted that freshly shocked gas may not be in either thermal or ionization equilibrium , and this can alter the observed properties of the post - shock gas .",
    "takizawa ( 1999 ) discusses the thermal equilibrium timescale , noting that the ion temperature is initially much higher than the electron temperature in the post - shock region ( since most of the incoming kinetic energy is in the ions ) , and that the two temperatures equilibrate on an electron - ion interaction timescale .",
    "however , this effect would lead to a _ low _ observed electron bremsstrahlung temperature , whereas we see a best fitting mekal temperature _ higher _ than the upper limit to the post - shock temperature .",
    "moreover , the equilibration timescale at the temperature and gas density in the region of 3921-x2 ( @xmath00.4 myr ) is much shorter than the post - shock timescale , inferred from the time elapsed since star formation ( several hundred myr ) .",
    "calculations of the thermal and dynamical evolution of a fast adiabatically expanding gas ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1999 ) show that a delay in recombination can lead to departures from ionization equilibrium .",
    "a full set of dynamically and thermally self - consistent equations is needed to calculate the timescale for recombination , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , breitschwerdt & schmutzler suggest that the dynamical timescale for a hot plasma ( t@xmath24k ) is much shorter than the intrinsic timescales ( e.g. for recombination , ionization etc . ) .",
    "the ionization non - equilibrium gives rise to the appearance of emission lines representative of higher temperatures than the actual gas temperature , and the over - estimation of the temperature if the spectrum is fitted with collisional ionization equilibrium models .",
    "however , for 3921-x2 , the upper limit to the post - shock temperature is @xmath00.96 kev , and it is difficult to see how a temperature as high as the best fitting mekal temperature , 2.18 kev , could be mimicked by this process . in addition , we do not see any emission lines in the spectra ( figure [ 3921-blob - spec ] ) which we would expect from this scenario .",
    "this lack of emission lines is consistent with the very low abundance of the best fitting mekal model .",
    "hence , we conclude that the high temperature of the best fitting mekal model is inconsistent with a shock - heated gas model .    in ngc 7252",
    ", we do not see an x - ray emission region analogous to that of 3921-x2 , i.e. with associated clusters , hi and h@xmath14 emission .",
    "however , in figure [ 7252hregs ] , we see a ` cavity ' in the 0.5@xmath92.0 kev x - ray emission to the north , which appears to correspond to the north - western hi tail where it crosses the hot gas . since the tail comes across the _ front _ of the remnant body ( schweizer 1982 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) , the increased hi surface density in the cavity region ( 15@xmath920 x10@xmath25 @xmath26 , figs . 5c and 5d in hibbard et al .",
    "1994 ) strongly suggests that the ` cavity ' is due to x - ray absorption by the neutral gas of the tidal tail in the foreground .",
    "this effect may of course be enhanced by the positions of 7252-x1 and 7252-x7 .    if x - ray halos are indeed regenerated by infall along tidal tails , then maybe insufficient time since peri - galacticon has passed for substantial regeneration to have occurred ( e.g. hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "considerable hi is evident out at least as far as the optical tails in ngc 7252 and beyond the optical loops to the south of ngc 3921 .",
    "hibbard & mihos ( 1995 ) model the kinematics of the hi gas in ngc 7252 using n - body simulations .",
    "they calculate that , of the hi originally residing in the spiral progenitors of this object , at least 3x10@xmath27  has already fallen inwards . however , the central regions of ngc 7252 are hi - poor , so atomic gas falling into the remnant body from the tails must be converted to other forms , at a rate of 1@xmath92  yr@xmath2 .",
    "the process of infall is a natural explanation for the conversion of hi to hot gas , stars and cold molecular gas .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by observations of both ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 which show the presence of all these three phases in the remnant bodies ( e.g. whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ; hibbard et al . 1994",
    "; hibbard & van gorkum 1996 ; schweizer 1996 ; schweizer et al .",
    "1996 ; yun & hibbard 2001 ) .    using the results of the hibbard & mihos simulations",
    ", we can estimate if there is sufficient hi still to fall back into the remnant body of ngc 7252 from the tidal tails , to increase the hot gas mass ( and hence luminosity ) to that seen in a typical elliptical galaxy .",
    "the simulations indicate that @xmath06x10@xmath28  of hi will return to within 5r@xmath29 over the next 3@xmath30 gyr , i.e. one fifth as much again as has already fallen into the central regions .",
    "we estimate the mass of hot gas already present in the remnant body from the parameters of the mekal components fitted to the nuclear region , and assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the mass is @xmath03x10@xmath31 , within the spectral extraction region .",
    "` typical ' x - ray bright elliptical galaxies ( not including brightest group and massive cluster ellipticals , which may be considered a different class ) have hot gas masses of 10@xmath3210@xmath10  ( e.g. forman et al . 1985 ) . even if _ all _ the hi gas still to return to the remnant body is converted to hot gas , with none involved in star formation or conversion to molecular gas , the total hot gas mass would be just below 10@xmath33 , and it is unlikely that the conversion to hot gas is anywhere near this efficient . for comparison , @xmath03x10@xmath33  of hi has already fallen back into the body of the galaxy , but we see only @xmath03x10@xmath31  of hot gas , which , assuming all the hot gas has been converted from hi , with no contributions from stellar mass loss , represents an efficiency of only 10% .",
    "it is hard to see that hi infall in this galaxy would create sufficient hot gas to reach the mass seen in typical elliptical galaxies .    we know that the northern tail of ngc 3291 is hi - poor , but the southern tail contains @xmath0 2x10@xmath27  of hi , with the tail becoming more gas - rich along its length ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 )",
    "however , there are no simulations of the kinematics of the atomic gas in ngc 3921 in the literature , so we do not know what proportion of this gas will return to the remnant body .",
    "in addition , the irregular x - ray structure of ngc 3921 invalidates the assumption of spherical symmetry used to calculate the hot gas mass in ngc 7252 , so we can not make the same calculation .",
    "however , assuming its similar x - ray luminosity to ngc 7252 indicates a similar gas mass , this galaxy would require an additional mass of hot gas @xmath345x10@xmath31  to take it to typical values .",
    "this only seems possible if the hi kinematics and/or conversion to hot gas in ngc 3921 are quite different from those in ngc 7252 .",
    "given the differences between the predicted hot gas masses of typical ellipticals and those predicted from our calculations involving hi masses , it is difficult to believe that hi infall can be solely responsible for the regeneration of the x - ray halo to luminosities typical of elliptical galaxies .",
    "additional support for the existence of another mechanism for halo regeneration comes from the work of osullivan et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "they see a long - term trend of increasing x - ray luminosity with mean stellar age , extending over 15 gyr , long after the hi tails seen in mergers have been completely assimilated into the body of the galaxy .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity continues to rise after the completion of hi infall , then , even if hi conversion is responsible for the presence of some of the hot gas , there must be an additional source , which contributes to the hot gas mass after virialisation , for example , stellar mass loss , as discussed below .",
    "the models of ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) investigate whether mass loss from stars could regenerate the x - ray halo .",
    "they predict a super - sonic wind - driven flow in the early stages of post - merger elliptical evolution , arising from two sources : mass - loss from evolving stars , and secularly declining heating from type i supernovae . during this stage ,",
    "a galaxy is x - ray faint , and the amount of hot x - ray gas , and hence the x - ray luminosity , decreases .",
    "this stage can persist for @xmath0 2 gyr , and is followed by a sub - sonic outflow . as the flow velocity decreases , this flow allows the build - up of hot gas , and results in rising x - ray luminosity over timescales @xmath3410 gyr . in this model ,",
    "ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 would be in the first , wind - driven stage , and indeed , they are x - ray faint .",
    "the gas density and temperature are expected to fall off smoothly with radius , without the presence of shocks .",
    "we see no evidence that this is not the case ( if we are correct in assuming that 3921-x2 is a ulx ) .",
    "however , in order to model the behaviour of gas density and temperature with radius in detail , we would need both better spatial resolution than _ xmm - newton _  can offer , and more counts .",
    "the sub - sonic outflow stage of this model , where x - ray luminosity increases gradually with time , is consistent with the observations of elliptical galaxies discussed by osullivan et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the third possible mechanism for the regeneration of the x - ray halo is the return of the hot gas which was expelled from the main body of the galaxy during the nuclear merging stage .",
    "this expelled gas can reach large radii before stalling .",
    "it then falls back into the galaxy , and shocks are expected as it collides with the existing halo gas .",
    "these outflows are typically asymmetrical ( e.g. read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "we see little evidence for the regeneration of the x - ray halo via this mechanism in ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 .",
    "we see little x - ray emission at large radii in either galaxy .",
    "this does not mean that we can reject the possibility that there is significant hot gas outside the main remnant bodies which is as yet too diffuse to have been detected in these observations .",
    "however , although the infall of hot gas may be delayed with respect to the cold gas , as the hot gas reaches larger radii than the cold , it will still occur on a galaxy dynamical time - scale ( osullivan et al .",
    "2001b ) . as with the infall of cold gas",
    ", it is hard to reconcile this with the long - term ( @xmath3410gyr ) trend of increasing x - ray luminosity with mean stellar age observed by osullivan et al .",
    "( 2001a ; 2001b ) .",
    "we summarise our conclusions as follows :      in both ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 , we observe ultra - luminous non - nuclear x - ray point sources .",
    "where spectral fitting has been possible , the spectra are well - fitted by either power - law models ( 3921-x3 , 7252-x1 , 7252-x3 , 7252-x7 ) or a disk blackbody accretion disk model ( 3921-x2 , 7252-x4@xmath35 ) .",
    "these energy distributions are typical of xrbs , and we suggest that these sources are hmxbs , associated with the recent star formation in these two galaxies . however , the possibility that the three off - nuclear sources in ngc 3921 are not point - like can not be ruled out at present .",
    "the point - like nature of the four _ xmm - newton _  sources in ngc 7252 is confirmed by _",
    "chandra _  observations , which also reveal a further two xpss , so that the total number of confirmed x - ray point sources observed in ngc 7252 ( assuming all are associated with the remnant ) is six .",
    "7252-x8 has no corresponding _",
    "chandra _  detection , and hence can not be confirmed as a point source .",
    "the differences in the evolutionary stages and progenitor galaxies of ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 do not appear to be reflected in their ulx populations .",
    "the numbers and luminosities of the candidate ulxs observed in ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 are compatible with the conclusion of swartz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , that more luminous ulxs are found in interacting and merging galaxies than in other morphological types .      in ngc 7252 , the more evolved merger remnant ,",
    "the diffuse x - ray gas is more relaxed : it is centred on the optical centre , is more symmetrical in the central regions and is cooler than the hot diffuse gas in ngc 3921 .",
    "this is most likely a result of its greater dynamical age .",
    "hot gas in ngc 7252 has a more compact core than that in ngc 3921 , reflecting differences between the progenitors of these two galaxies and their merger dynamics .",
    "when compared to ngc 3921 , the more violent star formation in ngc 7252 is not reflected in a higher x - ray luminosity for the hot diffuse gas .",
    "although substantial masses of hi are available to fall into the remnant bodies over the next several gyr , it seems unlikely that this is sufficient to increase the mass of hot gas in either ngc 3921 or ngc 7252 to the masses ( and hence luminosities ) seen in typical ellipticals .",
    "we see no compelling evidence that massive x - ray halo regeneration is occurring , even in these late - stage merger remnants .",
    "it is likely that regeneration occurs over much longer timescales , of up to 15 gyr , predominantly via mass loss from evolving stars , in a sub - sonic outflow stage commencing @xmath0 2 gyr after the merging event ( ciotti et al .",

    "<S> using the high sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _ , we have studied the x - ray emission of the two proto - typical late - stage merger remnants , ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 . in the case of ngc 7252 , this is complemented by archival _ </S>",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of the discrete x - ray point source populations and the hot diffuse gas components in these two galaxies , and compare them in the light of their different merger ages and histories .    </S>",
    "<S> we detect 3 candidate ultra - luminous x - ray point sources in ngc 3921 and at least 6 in ngc 7252 , for which we have high spatial resolution _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _  data . these have luminosities ranging from @xmath01.4x10@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ( for h@xmath3 75 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect these ulxs to be high mass x - ray binaries , associated with the recent star formation in these two galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> extended hot gas is observed in both galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we have sufficient counts in the _ xmm - newton _  data to fit two - component hot plasma models to their x - ray spectra and estimate the x - ray luminosities of the hot diffuse gas components to be 2.75x10@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 and 2.09x10@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 in ngc 3921 and ngc 7252 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these luminosities are low compared with the luminosities observed in typical mature elliptical galaxies ( l@xmath5@xmath010@xmath6 erg s@xmath2 ) , into which these merger remnants are expected to evolve . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see evidence that the x - ray halos of these galaxies are currently being regenerated to the masses and luminosities seen in typical elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of atomic gas available to fall back into the main bodies of these galaxies and shock - heat to x - ray temperatures is insufficient for this to be the sole halo regeneration mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that halo regeneration is most likely a long - term ( @xmath710 gyr ) process , occurring predominantly via mass loss from evolving stars , in a sub - sonic outflow stage commencing @xmath0 2 gyr after the merging event .    </S>",
