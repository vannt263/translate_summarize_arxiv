    "one of the main tasks of the lhc was and will be the search for supersymmetric ( susy ) particles .",
    "the largest production cross sections are expected for gluinos ( @xmath3 ) and squarks ( @xmath4 ) of the first generation .",
    "after the first run of the lhc at a center of mass ( c.m . ) energy of mostly 8  tev , no significant excesses have been observed in corresponding search channels @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "the absence of excess events can be interpreted in terms of lower bounds on gluino and squark masses , once assumptions on their decay cascades are made .",
    "these depend on the masses and couplings of many other susy particles , at least on the mass of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) . within simplified models",
    "( assuming simple 1-step decay cascades ) or the minimal susy extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , lower bounds on gluino and squark masses are typically in the 1.2 - 2  tev range , and @xmath5 1.7  tev if gluino and squark masses are assumed to be similar @xcite .",
    "although these constraints do not rule out the mssm , they eliminate a significant part of its `` natural '' parameter space @xcite .    however , the mssm is not the only susy extension of the standard model ( sm ) which alleviates the hierarchy problem , provides an acceptable dark matter candidate and leads to grand unification of the running gauge couplings . in the present paper",
    "we consider the next - to - minimal susy extension of the standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , where the coupling of the two higgs doublets of the mssm to an additional gauge singlet field @xmath6 renders more natural a value of @xmath7  gev of the sm - like higgs boson @xcite , while preserving the attractive features of the mssm .",
    "besides the higgs sector , the nmssm differs from the mssm through the presence of an additional neutralino ( the singlino , the fermionic component of the singlet superfield ) .",
    "the singlino can be the lsp , which can modify considerably the susy particle decay cascades @xcite .",
    "the strongest constraints from searches for gluinos and squarks of the first generation originate from channels where one looks for events with jets with large transverse momentum @xmath8 and missing transverse energy @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 is due to having all susy decay cascades ending in a stable lsp ( under the assumption of r - parity conservation ) , which escapes detection ( if neutral , as required for dark matter ) .    in the present paper",
    "we point out that a singlino - like lsp in the nmssm can reduce significantly the missing transverse energy at the end of susy particle decay cascades .",
    "this is due to the kinematics of the last process in a susy particle decay chain , nlsp @xmath10 lsp + @xmath11 , where nlsp denotes the next - to - lsp , and @xmath11 a particle ( e.g. a higgs boson ) decaying into visible components of the sm . for a light lsp ,",
    "if the mass of @xmath11 is close to the mass of the nlsp , little energy and momentum are transferred from the nlsp to the lsp ; most of the energy is transferred to @xmath11 . correspondingly , the lsp in the final state leads to little @xmath9 , whereas large @xmath9 is one of the relevant search criteria for susy particles in general .    the possibility to discover squarks and gluinos without relying on @xmath9 ,",
    "but on leptons , has been studied earlier in @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss decays of an nlsp into a scalar ( decaying visibly into sm particles ) and the lsp , referring to the nmssm without , however , considering the particular kinematic configurations analysed below .",
    "a scenario similar to the one discussed here has been named `` stealth supersymmetry '' @xcite . there , however , a complete `` stealth sector '' is added to the mssm in order to obtain the above kinematic configuration of the nlsp decay .",
    "an extensive survey of present constraints on gluinos from searches , including several without relying on @xmath9 , is given in @xcite . among the scenarios analysed in @xcite",
    "are so - called `` minimal hidden valley '' models .",
    "these are similar to the ones considered here after replacing the extra singlet scalar and its fermionic superpartner @xcite by the corresponding states of the nmssm ( and the nlsp higgsino by a bino - like nlsp ) .",
    "it was already found in @xcite that the kinematic configuration discussed above leads to the weakest constraints .",
    "the present scenario is opposite to the one of `` compressed supersymmetry '' @xcite where the masses of the nlsp and the lsp are assumed to be similar , and little energy is transferred to @xmath11 .",
    "then jets ( or leptons ) with large @xmath8 would be rare .",
    "moreover , unless a hard jet is emitted from the initial state ( `` monojet '' ) , the @xmath9 due to two lsps emitted from two susy particles back - to - back in the transverse plane tend to cancel .    in the mssm , the kinematic configuration considered here can not play a major rle : a light lsp ( with a mass of a few gev ) can only be bino - like , since winos or higgsinos would have charged partners with similar masses , already ruled out by lep .",
    "all squarks  appearing also in gluino decays  have hypercharge and hence couple to the bino . if the lsp is a very light bino , squarks will in general decay directly into the bino , and hardly pass through an nlsp ( e.g. a heavier neutralino or chargino ) and a state @xmath11 ( a higgs , @xmath12 or @xmath13 boson ) .",
    "thus only a fraction of cascade decays leads to a reduction of @xmath9 , so that the interpretation of the absence of signal events in terms of lower bounds on susy particle masses remains practically unchanged .    on the other hand",
    ", in the nmssm the bino can be the nlsp , the singlino a light lsp , and @xmath11 a priori a higgs , a @xmath12 or even a @xmath13 boson ( if the nlsp is a chargino ) .",
    "then the decays of @xmath11 can still give rise to missing energy in the form of neutrinos ; this is the case for the decays of the @xmath13 and @xmath12 bosons , and also for the sm - like higgs ( when it decays via @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , in the nmssm additional higgs bosons exist , which can be lighter than the @xmath12 boson and are not excluded by lep due to small couplings to @xmath16 .",
    "a lighter cp - even higgs boson @xmath17 with a mass below @xmath18 would have very small decay rates into @xmath14 , but decay dominantly into @xmath19 and , to some extent , into @xmath20 .",
    "although the latter decays can also give rise to some @xmath9 , the scenario nlsp @xmath10 lsp + @xmath17 with @xmath21 would be the most difficult one with respect to signatures based on  @xmath9 .",
    "( subsequently we denote scenarios with as little @xmath9 as possible as `` worst case '' . )    in the case of squark / gluino pair production , some @xmath9 can also originate from @xmath13 , @xmath12 and/or higgs decays which appear during decay cascades involving charginos and/or heavier neutralinos .",
    "again , a `` worst case '' scenario would be one where this does not happen if , for instance , the chargino and heavier neutralino masses are close to ( or above ) the squark masses .    in the present paper we concentrate on such `` worst case '' scenarios : first , we present the properties of points in the nmssm which are not excluded by present susy searches although all sparticle masses are below @xmath0  tev .",
    "second , we propose search strategies for these difficult scenarios , putting forward an analysis of events at the lhc near 14  tev c.m .",
    "energy , based on the decay products of two @xmath17 bosons in the @xmath22 + jets final state .",
    "our simulations indicate that , for not excessively heavy squarks and gluinos ( i.e. a not too small production cross section ) , a signal can be visible above standard model backgrounds .    in the next section",
    "we discuss in detail scenarios within the general nmssm , in which @xmath9 is reduced for kinematic reasons .",
    "results of event simulations of such a benchmark point are discussed , which explain the reduced sensitivity of present susy searches to such a scenario .",
    "we also discuss simplified models with varying lsp and @xmath17 masses , and the corresponding reduction of signal events . in section  3",
    "we attempt to extract signals for @xmath17 pair production at the lhc with 14  tev c.m .",
    "energy , with dedicated cuts which do not rely on @xmath9 . instead , we attempt to identify @xmath23-jets and @xmath24-leptons from boosted @xmath17 bosons with the help of a jet reconstruction with a small jet cone radius @xmath25 .",
    "section  4 contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "given a possible last step in a susy particle decay chain nlsp @xmath10 lsp + @xmath11 in the limit of a narrow phase space , @xmath26 , the energy ( momentum ) transferred from the nlsp to the lsp in the laboratory frame is proportional to the ratio of masses : [ eq:2.1 ] .",
    "hence , if the lsp is light , little ( missing transverse ) energy is transferred to the lsp ; the transverse energy is carried away by @xmath11 .",
    "the effect is the more important the narrower the phase space is .",
    "as explained in the introduction , such a scenario is difficult to realise in the mssm where such a light lsp must be bino - like .",
    "the particle content of the nmssm differs from that of the mssm by an additional singlino - like neutralino @xmath27 , and additional singlet - like cp - even and cp - odd higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "notably the nmssm spectrum contains three cp - even higgs bosons @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( ordered in mass ) .",
    "the singlino - like neutralino can be the lsp with a bino - like nlsp ( as occurs for the regions of parameter space considered below ) .",
    "then the above scenario of little @xmath9 being transferred to the lsp can be realised with a singlet - like cp - even higgs boson @xmath17 playing the rle of @xmath11 , whose subsequent decays give rise to little invisible transverse energy in the form of neutrinos .",
    "typical values for the masses would be a few gev for the singlino - like neutralino @xmath27 , a bino - like nlsp with a mass @xmath30 just below @xmath18 , and @xmath31 just below @xmath32 .",
    "note that , due to its reduced coupling to the @xmath12 boson , such a light @xmath17 can still be compatible with constraints from higgs searches at lep @xcite .    in the simplest @xmath33 invariant realisation of the nmssm ,",
    "the diagonal elements of the mass matrices for the ( pure ) singlet - like states @xmath27 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfy @xcite [ eq:2.2 ] m_^2 ~m_h_s^2 + m_a_s^2 , which forbids @xmath36 and hence @xmath37 unless soft susy breaking trilinear couplings are in the multi - tev range , in which case there can be strong deviations from the equality of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.2 ] ) for the mass eigenstates ( after diagonalization of the mass matrices ) .    however , @xmath36 is possible in the presence of @xmath33 violating terms like a soft susy breaking tadpole term @xmath38 , and/or a holomorphic soft susy breaking mass term @xmath39 .",
    "such terms are generated automatically in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , if the singlet superfield has couplings to the messenger fields @xcite .",
    "hence we consider in the following a general nmssm , still with a @xmath33 invariant superpotential [ eq:2.3 ] w _ =",
    "s h_uh_d + s^3 +  . in the above hatted letters",
    "denote superfields , and the ellipses denote the mssm - like yukawa couplings of @xmath40 and @xmath41 to the quark and lepton superfields .",
    "we allow for the following nmssm specific soft susy breaking terms [ eq:2.4 ] -l_^ = m_s^2 |s|^2 + ( a_h_u h_d s + _ s s + ^2 s^2 + a_s^3 ) + . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.3 ] ) , a vacuum expectation value @xmath42 generates an effective @xmath43 term @xmath44 , which has to be larger than @xmath45  gev for the charged higgsinos to satisfy bounds from lep .",
    "given the diagonal singlino mass term @xmath46 , a singlino mass of a few gev is obtained for @xmath47 about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath48 .",
    "for completeness we comment on the possibilities to obtain consistent properties of dark matter in such a scenario . within gmsb ,",
    "a gravitino can be lighter than @xmath27 which would thus not be the `` true '' lsp , but decay radiatively into a gravitino and a photon ( through a small photino component from a non - vanishing mixing with the bino / wino ) .",
    "however , the singlino life time would be so large that this decay would occur outside the detectors and have no impact on our subsequent analyses .",
    "( on the other hand , the singlino life time should not exceed @xmath45  s in order not to spoil nucleosynthesis unless the nlsp density is diluted through entropy production . ) alternatively , the singlino relic density can be reduced to comply with the observed dark matter relic density through the exchange of a cp - odd higgs state @xmath35 in the s - channel , provided @xmath49 .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed possible , and the benchmark point given below has this property .",
    "returning to the issue of @xmath9 , its suppression is maximised if no neutrinos from @xmath50 decays are emitted during squark / gluino decay cascades . in a",
    "truly `` worst case scenario '' winos , higgsinos , sleptons , stops and sbottoms are not produced neither in squark nor in gluino decays .",
    "bino @xmath51 singlino decays are impossible , if the bino mass is below @xmath18 . in table",
    "1 we give the parameters and particle masses of a benchmark point with these properties , for which physical masses and decay branching fractions have been obtained with the public code nmssmtools_4.2.1 @xcite .",
    ".parameters ( left and middle column ) and particle masses ( right column ) of a nmssm benchmark point . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the result displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , which is based on the simulation of @xmath52 events , shows that @xmath53 peaks indeed near the mass of @xmath17 , 83  gev for the benchmark point considered here .",
    "the event rates are normalised to an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath54 ; for the total squark - gluino production cross section at 14  tev we have 5232  fb at nlo+nnlo .",
    "the impact of the above cuts is shown in table  3 ; within the signal region 40  gev@xmath55  gev the cross section is about 23  fb .",
    "given the @xmath56 branching fraction of about 8% and the tagging efficiencies , the dominant reduction of signal events results from the requested @xmath57 @xmath23-jets and @xmath58 leptons .",
    "a priori , the following standard model backgrounds contribute to the final states defined above : @xmath59 from qcd and electroweak production , @xmath60 possibly with additional mistagged @xmath24 leptons , and @xmath61 with two mistagged @xmath24 leptons .",
    "we have estimated these backgrounds using the same simulation methods applied for the signal . however , in order to make our cut analysis sufficiently efficient , we also applied cuts at the parton level in madgraph on jets ( quarks and gluons ) and @xmath23-quarks : for @xmath23-quarks we required @xmath62  gev and @xmath63 , and for the four leading jets ( including @xmath23-quarks ) @xmath64  gev , respectively .",
    "we checked that these cuts do not generate a bias in the @xmath53 spectrum after applying the additional cuts described above and in table  3 .",
    "after the cuts , the background from @xmath59 from qcd and electroweak production turned out to be negligibly small , with a cross section in the signal region of about @xmath65  fb .",
    "after all cuts , the background from @xmath60 is also small , with a cross section in the signal region of about @xmath66  fb .",
    "however , the background from @xmath61 with two mistagged @xmath24 leptons is relatively large due to the fact that we tag for @xmath23-jets and @xmath24-leptons using jet reconstruction with a small jet cone radius @xmath25 .",
    "many of such `` slim '' jets are mistagged as @xmath24-leptons , often as pairs with a relatively low invariant mass . a priori , about 5% of all @xmath61 events after cuts contain such a fake @xmath24 pair .",
    "this fake rate can be reduced by a factor @xmath67 after a cut @xmath68  gev , which reduces the signal by only about 12%",
    ". then this background results in a cross section in the signal region of about @xmath69  fb .",
    "its contribution to @xmath53 , based on the simulation of 300000 events , is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , and it seems that the signal can be distinguished clearly from this background .    in practise",
    "the background is often obtained from data - driven control regions .",
    "once it is measured , modifications of the cuts given above and/or additional cuts ( for example on the absence of isolated leptons ) are likely to improve the signal / background ratio even further .    of course",
    ", the mass @xmath31 can differ from the value @xmath70  83  gev assumed for the benchmark point . in order to see the impact of a lighter @xmath17 we have repeated the simulation for a point with the same sparticle spectrum but @xmath71  gev , @xmath72  gev and @xmath73  gev . the resulting @xmath53 spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig:6 ] and again we see that the sequence of cuts allows , in principle , to identify @xmath31 from the @xmath53 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath74 final state , characteristic of squark / gluino production in the present scenario , resembles actually higgs pair production in the standard model up to the unknown @xmath17 mass but , provided that squarks and gluinos are not excessively heavy , with an associated larger cross section ( see @xcite for some recent studies in the standard model ) .",
    "corresponding techniques like more refined subjet - based analyses applied to the @xmath75 final state in @xcite can probably be useful here as well .",
    "the squark / gluino production cross sections would decrease , of course , for squarks and/or gluinos heavier than their benchmark value ( 860/890  gev , respectively ) , and the kinematics will change .",
    "first we investigate the impact of heavier squarks and gluinos on the shape of @xmath9 .",
    "we illustrate this with simplified models where , as in the case of the previous benchmark point , squarks decay with a 100% branching ratio into the bino - like nlsp ( still with a mass of 89  gev ) which can only decay ( with 100% br ) into @xmath17 and the singlino - like lsp ( both still with masses of 83  gev and 5  gev , respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath9 distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] for squark / gluino masses of 1000  gev or 1400  gev .",
    "( the gluinos are taken 5  gev heavier than squarks to allow , for simplicity , for flavour democratic gluino 3-body decays into quarks + squarks of the first two generations . )",
    "one finds that @xmath9 still strongly peakes at low values ; hard cuts on @xmath9 would remove again most of the signal events .",
    "the transverse momenta of the the leading and next - to - leading @xmath17 for squarks / gluinos with masses of 1000  gev and 1400  gev , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .    as visible from fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , the average transverse momenta of the @xmath17 states are considerably larger for heavier squarks / gluinos .",
    "finally we ask whether the shape of the @xmath53 spectrum changes for heavier squarks / gluinos . using the same analysis and cuts as before , the resulting @xmath53 spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig:9 ] for squark / gluino masses of 1000  gev , 1200  gev and 1400  gev .",
    "we see that the shape of the @xmath53 spectrum remains unchanged ; only the signal rate decreases as expected ( slightly less , in fact ) as does the production cross section which is now about 2226  fb , 693  fb and 242  fb for squark / gluino masses of 1000  gev , 1200  gev and 1400  gev , respectively .",
    "however , for squark / gluino masses above 1400  gev , the signal obtained with the present cuts ( and jet analysis ) starts to fall below the background from @xmath61 with two mistagged @xmath24 leptons ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "since the production of heavier squarks and gluinos generates both @xmath17 states and jets with larger transverse momenta , cuts can be optimised .",
    "search channels with significantly harder cuts on the transverse momenta of at least the candidate @xmath76-jets ( assumed to contain the remnants of the leading @xmath17 ) can be employed .",
    "corresponding analyses will be the subject of future publications .",
    "the most important result of the present paper is the existence of scenarios in the general nmssm in which a light singlino at the end of sparticle decay cascades reduces strongly the missing transverse energy , one of the essential criteria in standard search channels for supersymmetry . in such `` worst case scenarios ''",
    "hardly any missing transverse energy is produced along each step of sparticle decay cascades .",
    "we present a realistic benchmark point , consistent with the properties of the standard model - like higgs boson at @xmath7  gev and the dark matter relic density , satisfying present constraints from susy search channels with all sparticle masses below @xmath0  tev .",
    "the two nmssm - like higgs bosons @xmath17 , produced in each event of squark , squark - gluino or gluino pair production in this scenario , allow for new search channels which do not rely on large missing transverse energy , but on the @xmath17 decay products .",
    "we have presented an analysis which shows that , for not too heavy squarks / gluinos , a @xmath17 signal can be visible above the standard model background in the @xmath22 + jets final state . this analysis can certainly be improved in various aspects , but already indicates the lines along which a signal can be obtained .    among the possible improvements are analyses based on jet substructure as is the case of higgs pair production into the same final state in @xcite ( replacing the step of our analysis based on a jet cone radius of 0.15 ) , which may also help to reduce the background from mistagged tau pairs . also searches for a @xmath77 final state as in @xcite might be feasible .",
    "finally , in order to get some direct information on the masses of the originally produced squark / gluino pairs ( beyond the production cross section ) , analyses based on jet substructure may be combined with analyses based on @xmath78 as , for example , in @xcite .",
    "variants of the benchmark scenarios discussed here could also be realised in principle : first , winos and/or higgsinos could be lighter and appear in squark decay cascades .",
    "then standard susy search channels relying on @xmath9 and jets , isolated leptons etc . , start to become sensitive to squark / gluino production but it remains to be studied when , in the presence of a light singlino and for the kinematical situation discussed here , such search channels become more sensitive than the type of analysis presented here .",
    "second , the final state @xmath79 in the final step nlsp @xmath80 + lsp of sparticle decay cascades does not necessarily have to be a light nmssm - specific higgs boson @xmath17 . again ,",
    "if @xmath11 is for instance a @xmath12 boson or a combination of @xmath12 and @xmath81 bosons ( depending on the branching fractions of the nlsp ) , standard susy search channels can become relevant since more @xmath9 is expected from @xmath11 decays .",
    "however , if the number of events with @xmath9 is still reduced due the particular kinematical situation discussed here , channels which depend less on @xmath9 but more on @xmath11 decay products would again be more promising .",
    "such cases merit also to be studied in the future .",
