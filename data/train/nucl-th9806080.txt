    "the leading contribution to two nucleons scattering in an s - wave comes from local four - nucleon operators .",
    "contributions from pion exchanges and from higher derivative operators are suppressed by additional powers of the external nucleon momentum and by powers of the light quark masses .",
    "the technique successfully describes the @xmath4 scattering phase shifts up to center - of - mass momenta of @xmath5 per nucleon@xcite in all partial waves .    to accommodate the unnaturally large scattering lengths in s - wave nucleon - nucleon scattering , fine - tuning",
    "is required , which in turn can complicate power counting in the effective field theory .",
    "dimensional regularization with power divergence subtraction ( pds ) , described in @xcite , provides a consistent power counting scheme .",
    "since the deuteron is the lightest nucleus and does not have irreducible forces between three or more nucleons , it provides a unique laboratory for studying the strong interactions .",
    "being bound by only @xmath6 , the characteristic momentum of the nucleons in the deuteron is @xmath7 and should be well described by the effective field theory which is valid below the scale @xmath8@xcite .",

    "the charge radius and form factor receive contributions from leading and next - to - leading ( nlo ) orders in the expansion with the theoretical result reproducing the measured values within the uncertainty coming from the omission of higher order terms . the magnetic moment and form factor",
    "receive contributions at leading order from only the nucleon magnetic moments . at next - to - leading order",
    "the deuteron magnetic moment determines a combination of counterterms that appear in the lagrange density at this order .",
    "the quadrupole moment first appears from the exchange of a single potential pion .",
    "pion - pole contributions , multiple potential pion exchange , and higher dimension operators contribute only at higher orders in the expansion .    unlike the electromagnetic form factors , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of an object are a direct measure of its `` deformation '' due to the presence of external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "extensive experimental and theoretical progress has been made in understanding the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon ( for an overview see @xcite ) .",
    "chiral perturbation theory provides a systematic theoretical analysis in the single nucleon sector , with one - loop pion graphs dominating the electric polarizability , e.g. @xcite .",
