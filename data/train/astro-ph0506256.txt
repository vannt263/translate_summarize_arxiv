    "the relation between strong magnetic fields and dense matter is a subject that have attracted so much attention recently , especially after the observations of peculiar x - ray emission from anomalous x - pulsars ( axps ) and low energy @xmath1-ray radiation from soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) . the central engine of these radiations",
    "is believed to be a neutron star or quark star endowed with a magnetic field larger than @xmath2 g. the x - ray binaries dubbed as galactic black hole candidates have also been recently suggested as possessing a strange star as its primary ref .",
    "the existence of quark stars was proposed in 1969 , about five years after than the gell - man prediction of quarks .",
    "bodmer ref .   also advanced the idea of strange quark matter in 1971 . by quark matter",
    "is meant here a fermi gas of 3a quarks which together constitute a single color - singlet baryon with baryon number a. it is known two types of quark matter : the first one is called non - strange matter , which consists only of two flavor @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( the 2sc model ) , while the second one , dubbed strange matter , is made - up of 3 flavors @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "strange matter has the particularity that it guarantees the equilibrium with weak interactions . in 1984",
    "witten ref .",
    ", and later farhi and jaffe ref .  , showed that for strange matter , the binding energy could be lower than for fe over a rather wide range of qcd parameters .",
    "witten ref .   has pointed out two possible pathways to form strange matter : the quark hadron phase transition in the early universe and the conversion of neutron stars into strange ones at extremely high densities . in this way",
    "the most stable compact star might be a strange star rather than a neutron star .",
    "neutrons and protons are both constituted of quarks , hence as a highly dense system of nucleons , a neutron star , especially its core , might have been deconfined to a quark ( plus gluons ) system under the extraordinary conditions imposed by a a very dense nuclear matter and supercritical magnetic field .",
    "because of its extremely high density ( @xmath6 g/@xmath7 ) , a neutron star might actually be a pure quark star , or alternatively a neutron star might contain a quark core.    the equation of state ( eos ) of both strange and non - strange matter , and the structure and stability of stars constituted of each of these types of matter have been studied using simplified models such as the mit bag model ref .",
    "( see also lugones & horvath 2003 , and the important set of actualized references therein ) .",
    "the mit bag model is the most important hypothesis introduced to study the properties of quark matter for quark stars . as such",
    ", it considers the balance quarks as a relativistic free - particle system confined in an impenetrable bag whose equilibrium rests on the bag constant @xmath0 , i.e. ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 defines the quark field . in other words , the balance pressure on the bag surface stems from the outward fermi gas pressure counterbalanced by the inward ( vacuum ) bag pressure , which mimics the strong interaction that hold the quarks together .    on the other hand , the matter in this condition , extremely dense , exhibits novel properties which are worthwhile to study .",
    "several authors have studied equations of state and thermodynamical properties of these systems and all have concluded that the physical behavior change ref .",
    "- : thermodynamical properties , dynamics , etc . in particular , in the paper ref .",
    "we study the neutron gas in presence of a strong magnetic field with the aim to describe neutron stars .",
    "we unveiled the anisotropic behavior of the pressures perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field direction .",
    "this result implies that the shape of some astrophysical object endowed with extremely high magnetic fields may become prolate once quantum effects are taken into account .",
    "other important conclusions of this paper suggest that we can determine the physical conditions for which the pressure perpendicular to the ( dipole ) magnetic field could vanish , and thus for the system to be unstable to collapse pulled down by its own gravity .",
    "it is then timely to emphasize that when these systems are described within a classical approach the conclusions are quite opposite , in the sense that the pressure parallel to the @xmath10-field turns out to be smaller than that perpendicular to it ref .  .",
    "the star then takes an oblate shape and the collapse may take place in the parallel direction to the field . the shape the astrophysical object would adopt",
    "would be flat or toroidal , i.e. , similar to a disk or torus perpendicular to the @xmath10-field ref .  .",
    "strong magnetic fields are known to exist in the interior of compact stars .",
    "notwithstanding , only a few attempts to study the behavior of quark matter permeated by a magnetic field have been performed so far ref .  .",
    "the scope of this paper is to show that for quark matter acted upon by a strong magnetic field the same anisotropic behavior obtained earlier in ref",
    ".  - holds . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we focus here on the case of non - strange quark matter , as a degenerate fermi gas of quarks .",
    "nonetheless , our treatment and conclusions prove to be independent of the specific model being used .",
    "as could be seen later , it is possible ( self - consistently ) to use the mit bag model in presence of a magnetic field and the result leads to obtain an anisotropic bag - pressure that depends on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the equation ( 1 ) is modified because spinors interact with the magnetic field .    to study the degenerate quark gas in presence of a magnetic field we follow two approaches : in the first one , one considers the quark field interacting with magnetic field via its charge .",
    "in the second one , it is considered that quarks have anomalous magnetic moment . at the end , we obtain little differences between both approaches which are related to the stability of the system .",
    "when we study a model which takes into account the anomalous magnetic moment , then the system becomes more stable ; in the sense that for a fixed density it is necessary to have a more stronger magnetic field in order to bring the system into instability .    chakrabarty et al .",
    "ref .   analyzed the conditions for stability of nucleonic bags , e.g. , neutrons and protons , and obtained the instability condition for these particles inasmuch the same way as we do here for a quark gas .",
    "although we agree with their statement that nucleons immerse in a huge magnetic field become unstable , we have some criticisms to their approach to the issue .",
    "the first one is related to the use of our thermodynamical arguments for nucleons since these are 3 particle systems ( it is not completely satisfactory to use quantum statistical physics to study a few body system ) .",
    "the second one is that in the extremely degenerate case the anisotropic behavior of pressures obtained in this paper eq.(5)-(6 ) is such that the transverse pressure goes to zero when the magnetic field grows while the parallel pressure grows with the field strength .",
    "counter to this view , those authors claimed just the opposite ( such a behavior only occurs in the classical case ) .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    "we describe shortly the general conditions of two - flavor , non - strange quark matter of the mit model in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we also rewrite the energy - momentum tensor and state its relation to the eos of the system . in section 3",
    "we study the system of a degenerate quark gas by firstly including the anomalous magnetic moment , and after by ignoring it .",
    "we also include a comparison of our results here with the model of the neutron gas with anomalous magnetic moment as a toy model of neutron stars ref .  .",
    "section 4 gives the conclusions .",
    "to study quark matter we have to use qcd .",
    "however , for our purpose here is enough to use the mit - bag model ref .  , which in a phenomenologically way mimics the strong interaction .",
    "we start by introducing a couple of basic parameters : @xmath11 the coupling constant , and @xmath0 as the vacuum pressure in the mit bag model .",
    "nevetheless , in this paper it is enough for us to work with a two - flavor quark matter despite it is not in equilibrium with the weak interaction . we essentially want to show that the presence of a magnetic field in a quark matter ensemble forces the appearance of an instability which is of similar nature to that we have previously found for both the electron and the neutron gas ref .  - .",
    "the lagrangian density including the mit @xmath0 model in presence of a magnetic field should be written as    @xmath12\\theta_{\\nu}(x)-\\frac{1}{2}\\overline{\\psi}\\psi\\delta_{s}\\label{lagrangeana}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the wave function of quarks @xmath13 represents the current quark masses and @xmath14 corresponds to the quark charges . @xmath0 is the bag constant , and the parameter @xmath15 taking the values : @xmath16 inside the bag , while outside it takes on @xmath17 .",

    "more detailed calculations will appear in ref .  .",
    "if we take @xmath36 then @xmath0 takes the form    @xmath37    and therefore @xmath0 in the presence of a magnetic field has an anisotropic form which depends on the @xmath10-direction in space , here related to the @xmath38 direction .",
    "this section is devoted to obtain the equation of state of magnetized quark matter which starting point is the statistical average of energy - momentum tensor , eq.([tensor ] ) . to do that we use standard methods of finite temperature quantum field theory ref .  .",
    "the calculation of @xmath39 formally means to replace the lagrangian by the thermodynamical potential @xmath40 , which then is given by the expression    @xmath41    where the four - components of @xmath42 have the form @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , with @xmath45 the boltzman constant and t is the temperature .",
    "let us note that in the context of the modified mit bag model to describe magnetized quark matter , only what happens inside the bag is interesting , so we will put @xmath46 in both the lagrangian and thermodynamical potential .",
    "the calculation of the thermodynamical potential is presented in next section .",
    "starting from it we can calculate the energy momentum tensor . as we see below",
    ", the structure of @xmath47 remains model independent .",
    "similar structure was obtained in ref .",
    ", , where the energy - momentum tensor was derived from qed and electroweak theory .",
    "the thermodynamical potential contains information about the matter and electromagnetic interactions , and the electromagnetic tensor also appears in the structure .",
    "let us note that these steps have been followed in details in ref .  -",
    "for degenerate gases of electrons and neutrons . for that reason in this note we do not devote time in deriving the energy momentum tensor , which can be deduced doing a careful extrapolation of the previous papers in ref .  - .",
    "the expression of @xmath48 has the form    @xmath49    where for the sake of simplicity we assume    @xmath50    and @xmath51 is the thermodynamical potential of the magnetized degenerate quark gas , ( obviously independent of the @xmath0 constant ) , and @xmath52 denotes the species of quarks .",
    "let us recall that the expression of @xmath48 is general and would be used to take into account the electric and magnetic interactions .",
    "the scope of this paper is to analyze only magnetic effects , so in what follow we consider the magnetic field pointing in the direction @xmath53 .",
    "all off - diagonal components of this tensor vanish .",
    "the diagonal components of the tensor @xmath54 corresponds to the energy density and the pressures , albeit the last ones are anisotropic due to the magnetic field .",
    "the tensor can be written as follows    @xmath55    equations ( [ presiones ] ) show that @xmath56 if the magnetization is a positive quantity , and thus the behavior of the gas is paramagnetic . in the next section",
    "we calculate explicitly the magnetization and the pressures .",
    "we can prove that the magnetization is a positive quantity .",
    "the condition of quantum - magnetically - induced transverse collapse : @xmath57 , discussed in ref .",
    "- , implies for the magnetically modified mit bag model , the relation    @xmath58    however , this condition would be enforced also for the bag collapse , together with    @xmath59    this would mean an anisotropic bag pressure ( which is otherwise expected from ( [ bag ] ) since the nucleon is deformed by the magnetic field ) , and in place of ( [ omega ] ) we would have @xmath60 .",
    "notice , nonetheless , that in the absence of the magnetic field the pressure becomes isotropic and we recover the condition of stability ( or instability ) of the bag model given by @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we conclude that a magnetic field brings in an instability to the system , but it is compatible with the bag model if we consider that the bag is not isotropic and the nucleons are deformed in a prolate - shape .",
    "our aim in this section is to discuss the collapse described in the previous section .",
    "we derive the thermodynamical quantities of the degenerate quark gas in presence of an ultra strong magnetic field .",
    "in particular we calculate the thermodynamical potential and magnetization to evaluate the anisotropic pressures eq .",
    "( [ presiones ] ) .    in general , the quark spectrum in the external field @xmath10 has the form    @xmath62    where @xmath14 is the quark s charge , @xmath13 represents the quark masses , @xmath63 are the eigenvalues corresponding to two orientations of magnetic moment ( parallel and antiparallel ) , and @xmath64 anomalous magnetic moment of quarks .",

    "the critical @xmath10-field at which the coupling energy of its magnetic moment equals the rest - energy is for @xmath3-quarks @xmath74  g and for @xmath4 @xmath75  g.    thus , for the quarks thermodynamical potential eq .",
