    "solution @xmath8 of this rh problem satisfies the following matrix differential equation with meromorphic coefficients : = _ n=1^m , where a_n= g_n t_n g_n^-1 .",
    "suppose now that all monodromy matrices do nt depend on positions of singularities @xmath69 and that for any @xmath70 none of the numbers @xmath71 differ by integer .",

    "once a solution of the schlesinger system is given , one can define the locally holomorphic tau - function @xcite by the system of equations = h_n|_ = _n(_^-1)^2 ; 0.8 cm = 0 .",
    "the tau - function does not depend on normalization point @xmath56 .",

    "namely , the new set of monodromies corresponds to function @xmath81 , whose logarithmic derivative with respect to @xmath6 coincides with the logarithmic derivative of @xmath72 .    according to malgrange @xcite , the isomonodromic tau - function can be interpreted as determinant of certain tplitz operator .",
    "the important role in the theory of rh problems is played by the divisor of zeros of the tau - function in the universal covering of the space @xmath82 .",
    "in analogy to the theta - divisor @xmath24 on a jacobi variety , malgrange denoted this divisor by @xmath0 .",

    "[ sectau ] .      in this paper we shall consider two special kinds of @xmath3 monodromy representations .",
    "representation @xmath52 is called the permutations representation if matrix @xmath85 is a permutation matrix for each @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "remind that a matrix is called matrix of permutation if each raw and each column of this matrix contain exactly one non - vanishing entry and this entry equals to 1 .",
    "permutation matrices are in natural one - to - one correspondence with elements of permutation group @xmath86 .",
    "the definition ( [ permut ] ) is self - consistent since the product of any two permutation matrices is again a permutation matrix .",
    "let us introduce now the notion of quasi - permutation monodromy representation :    representation @xmath52 is called the quasi - permutations representation if @xmath57 is a quasi - permutation matrix for any @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "again , this definition is natural since all quasi - permutation matrices form a subgroup in @xmath87 .",
    "we repeat once more that a matrix is called the quasi - permutation matrix if each raw and each column of this matrix contain only one non - vanishing entry .    we shall call two quasi - permutation representations @xmath52 and @xmath88 equivalent if there exists some diagonal matrix @xmath80 such that _ = d _",

    "since @xmath90 cancels out in ( [ equiv ] ) , the action of matrix @xmath80 in ( [ equiv ] ) depends on @xmath91 constants .",
    "therefore , taking ( [ moninf ] ) into account , we conclude that the @xmath51 quasi - permutation representations of @xmath53 $ ] form a @xmath92 - parametric family .",
    "let us now discuss the correspondence between the quasi - permutation representations of @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath4-sheeted coverings of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath52 be a quasi - permutation representation of @xmath53 $ ] . to every such representation we can naturally assign a permutation representation @xmath93 substituting @xmath26 instead of all non - vanishing entries of all monodromy matrices .",
    "notice that if some monodromy matrix @xmath94 is diagonal , the corresponding element @xmath95 of the permutation group is identical .",
    "there exists a one - to - one correspondence between permutation representations of @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath4-sheeted compact riemann surfaces realized as ramified coverings of @xmath11 with projections of branch points on @xmath11 equal to @xmath7 .",
    "given a ramified covering @xmath5 with projections @xmath7 of branch points on @xmath11 , we construct the corresponding permutation representation as follows .",
    "denote the projection of @xmath5 on @xmath11 by @xmath96 .",
    "generators @xmath97 of permutation monodromy group are given by the following construction .",
    "consider the pre - image @xmath98 of the generator @xmath64 .",
    "this pre - image is a union of @xmath4 ( not necessary closed ) disjoint contours on @xmath5 which start and end at some of the points @xmath99 ( by @xmath9 we denote the point of@xmath10th sheet of @xmath5 which has projection @xmath6 on @xmath11 ) .",
    "denote by @xmath100 the component of @xmath101 which starts at the point @xmath99 ; the endpoint of this contour is @xmath102 for some @xmath103 $ ] .",

    "on the other hand , starting from some permutation monodromy representation we obviously can glue the sheets of the riemann surface at the branch points @xmath69 in such a way that it corresponds to the permutation monodromies ( [ mperm ] ) .",
    "moreover , this riemann surface is obviously compact .",
    "it is also clear that the branched covering @xmath5 is connected iff the associated permutation representation @xmath93 is irreducible .",
    "we notice that if some quasi - permutation monodromy matrix @xmath94 is diagonal , then corresponding matrix @xmath97 is equal to @xmath107 , and @xmath60 is in fact not a projection of any branch point on @xmath11 .",
    "however , in the sequel we shall treat such points in the same fashion as all other @xmath35 s . our formulas below explicitly contain multiplicities of all branch points ; the formulas are written in such form that this does not lead to any inconveniences or inconsistencies .",
    "in this paper we shall make two non - essential simplifying assumptions :    * first , we assume that different branch points @xmath108 have different projections @xmath109 on @xmath6-plane , i.e. @xmath110 for @xmath111 . *",

    "an arbitrary rh problem with quasi - permutation representation , corresponding to non - singular curves , may be easily solved by degeneration of the construction presented below to a submanifold in the space of branch points where some of @xmath35 s coincide .",
