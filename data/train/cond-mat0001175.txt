    ", they provide useful tools to study equilibrium and nonequilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "when applying the bethe ansatz method to the heisenberg @xmath0 spin chain , one may doubt whether the bethe ansatz produces the complete set of eigenstates .",
    "the completeness of the bethe ansatz is proved for an inhomogeneous generalization of the @xmath0 chain threaded by the aharonov - bohm flux  @xcite .",
    "it implies that the bethe ansatz for the @xmath0 hamiltonian is also complete in a general sense .",

    "takahashi  @xcite showed that the number of the states constructed from the bethe ansatz using the string conjecture is equal to the total number of the spin states .",

    "in fact the state @xmath8 , which is an eigenstate of the @xmath0 hamiltonian , is not produced from the _ regular _  ( non - singular ) solutions of the bethe ansatz  ( see below for the definition of the state @xmath9 ) .",
    "quasi - particle momenta corresponding to the state are divergent  @xcite and the bethe ansatz wave function is ill - defined .",

    "however it should be examined whether the singular states are relevant to the involved physical quantities of the heisenberg @xmath0 spin chain since , if so , one must first consider the generalized model and take the suitable limit  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is helpful to answer the question why there appear the singular states and how many there are in general down - spin number sectors . in this paper , we investigate the symmetry properties of the @xmath0 hamiltonian and the bethe ansatz wave functions to show that the regular solution of the bethe ansatz with well - defined wave functions does not contain a certain class of eigenstates .",

    "the state counting discussed in the previous section is not exact .",
    "states from different @xmath114 sets may be degenerate at @xmath41 . in that case perturbation calculations",
    "should be carried out in an enlarged space and it is not guaranteed that each @xmath114 set generates at least one singular state .",

    "then the bethe ansatz may produce the linear superpositions of them .",
    "we believe that those effects do not affect the leading order of magnitude of the total number of the singular states .",
    "we checked this by diagonalizing the @xmath0 hamiltonian exactly with @xmath165 .",

    "many singular states become degenerate with non - singular states and they are not counted as the singular states . in table 1 , we show the total number of the singular states at @xmath170 , and @xmath171 . due to the accidental degeneracy",
    "the number varies with @xmath45 .",
    "it is confirmed that the number increases approximately as @xmath144 at the three values of @xmath45 .",
    "the singular behaviors of some bethe ansatz solutions have been noticed for the heisenberg @xmath0 model  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . so the generalizations to the inhomogeneous @xmath0 model with aharonov - bohm flux were considered and their bethe ansatz solutions were shown to be complete  @xcite . in those cases the hamiltonian does not possess the lattice inversion symmetry and the present analysis is not applicable .",
    "the singular states include low - lying states in the half - filling case , @xmath172 .",

    "they are not the eigenstates of the inversion operator @xmath2 .",
    "for nonzero @xmath45 the degeneracy is removed , and the states evolve into the eigenstates of @xmath2 with @xmath173",

    "those states are important in identifying the operator content of the @xmath0 model in the context of the conformal field theory  ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they have the scaling dimension @xmath175 with @xmath176 and @xmath177 . to recover the whole operator content from the bethe ansatz",
    ", one should introduce the aharonov - bohm flux and take the limit where the flux vanishes as done in  @xcite .",
    "so far we have assumed @xmath10 is even . for odd @xmath10",

    "we have performed the same numerical analysis for odd @xmath179 and found that the nondegenerate states with @xmath5 do not exist .",
