    "the computation of quark masses is one of the most successfull application of lattice qcd . within this framework",
    "an interesting role is played by the determination of the @xmath2quark mass . despite the fact that one can not accomodate the @xmath2quark on a lattice ,",
    "its mass is computed to a very good accuracy . as it is known , the key of the success is the use of some form of effective theory .",
    "many approaches have been used , whose results are consistent within errors in the quenched approximation @xcite .",
    "a popular determination comes from heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "it shares with other approaches the need of dealing with the mass counterterm we will be concerned with . within hqet , the most direct relation between the mass of a physical hadron ( @xmath3 ) and the mass of the heavy quark is @xmath4 in which @xmath5 is the hqet expansion mass parameter and @xmath6 is the ( linearly divergent ) binding energy .",
    "however , @xmath5 is not yet properly defined at this stage .",
    "a procedure for actually making use of the previous formula is implemented in @xcite .",
    "first of all , one matches the qcd propagator to its lattice hqet counterpart to obtain a relation involving the pole mass @xmath7 this relation contains the quantity whose perturbative computation we are reporting on , _",
    "i.e. _ the so called residual mass @xmath8 , a linearly divergent additive mass counterterm which is peculiar to a hard cut - off regularization scheme like the lattice .",
    "the pole mass can in turn be related to the @xmath9 mass @xmath10 @xmath11 \\;,\\ ] ] the @xmath12 coefficients with @xmath13 being known from @xcite .",
    "if we are now able to compute ( @xmath14 is the lattice coupling ) @xmath15 one can put everything together to get @xmath16 \\times \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\left [ 1 + \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } ( \\frac{\\as}{\\pi})^{n+1 } d_n \\right ] \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this relation @xmath17 is @xmath18 ( and the @xmath19 get thus translated into @xmath20 ) .",
    "@xmath6 can be computed as the decay constant of the correlation function of two axial currents .",
    "knowing @xmath8 is crucial since it cancels both the divergence of @xmath6 and the renormalon ambiguities which come from the matching between @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "since both cancelations take place in perturbation theory , one has to carefully assess to which accuracy one can control the procedure .",
    "while @xmath23 has been known for a long time , @xmath24 was computed in @xcite , while @xmath25 was computed in @xcite and then also in @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath25 greatly improved the accuracy of the quenched determination of the @xmath2quark mass .",
    "@xmath26 was computed using the same strategy used for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we computed the wilson loops @xmath27 for all the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 up to @xmath30 .",
    "this was done on a @xmath31 lattice using numerical stochastic perturbation theory .",
    "the computation was done for wilson gauge and wilson quarks action and the sea quarks masses were put to zero ( _ i.e. _ the appropriate counterterms for the perturbative critical mass were plugged in ) . from wilson loops and creutz s ratios",
    "one can compute @xmath32 which in turn can yield the static potential via @xmath33 the static potential is just the sum of the coulomb potential ( which can be described in terms of a potential coupling in whose definition the logarithmic divergencies are absorbed ) and the ( linearly divergent ) mass counterterm we are interested in @xcite @xmath34 this means that the perturbative computation of the static potential can be read as the computation of the matching between the lattice and the potential couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ in the previous formula @xmath35 the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 being dictated by @xmath38parameters and @xmath39functions coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 since the matchings between both the potential and the @xmath9 couplings @xcite and the @xmath9 and the lattice couplings @xcite are known , the only unknown quantity in eq .",
    "( [ matching ] ) is @xmath8 .",
    "our procedure was to fit the coefficients @xmath42 by matching our perturbative computation of the static potential to eq .",
    "( [ matching ] ) .",
    "an example of the fitting procedure can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the intervals in which fits were performed were such that : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the mean value of @xmath28 in the fitting interval ; the fitting intervals themselves were from @xmath47 up to @xmath48 points long ) .",
    "we then choose in terms of @xmath49 : the errors we quote refer to the interval embraced by letting @xmath49 vary within a given interval .",
    "on top of that we could also inspect that the impact of lattice artifacts was under control ( an handle is the value of known parameters entering the matching relations ) .",
    "we got @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( to be compared with the analytical values @xmath52 and @xcite @xmath53 ) and finally @xmath54 using the last result the authors of @xcite were able to repeat the analysis of their @xmath1 unquenched data . the result for the @xmath2quark mass is @xcite @xmath55 at least three considerations are in order .",
    "first of all , by taking into account the value of @xmath26 the central value moved from @xmath56 to @xmath57 and ( what is more important ) the last error , which is the one taking into account the indeterminations in the perturbative matching , got roughly halved .",
    "a second observation is that the new analysis yields different values for the quenched and unquenched results .",
    "still , they are compatible within errors and in the end further investigation is needed .",
    "the third point is the assessment of sistematic errors involved in the procedure . in this approach one sticks to finite values of the lattice spacing .",
    "the finite lattice spacing dependence is not dramatic and it gets decreased by including the new term in the matching . on the other hand ,",
    "the control on renormalon ambiguities seems firm .",
    "+ after the conference the analysis was refined and completed .",
    "the final version of the computation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we thanks v. gimenez which on behalf of the authors of @xcite shared with us the results of their new analysis of the @xmath2quark mass , with our new result taken into account .    9",
