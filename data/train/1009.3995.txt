    ", young cygob2 association is of special interest .",
    "many unevolved o / of  stars have been identified there as well as an lbv candidate  the variable star no.12 .",

    "optical spectra of cygob2 no.12 were taken using the chelle spectrographs of the 6-meter telescope of the special astrophysical observatory .",
    "on june 12 , 2001 , we used the pfes spectrograph ( ( * ? ? ? * panchuk et al .",
    "1998 ) ) with a 1040@xmath41170-pixel ccd at the prime focus and got a spectrum with a resolution of @xmath5 15000 ( 20 kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "later we used the nes spectrograph  ( ( * ? ? ? * panchuk et al .",
    "2009 ) ) equipped with a 2048@xmath42048-pixel ccd and an image slicer and obtained spectra with @xmath760000 ( 5kms@xmath6 ) on april 12 , 2003 and on december  8 ,  2006 .",
    "the spectral types we derived for three dates were the same within the errors : b5.0@xmath00.5 , b4.8@xmath00.5 and b4.0@xmath00.5 .",
    "the luminosity type is ia@xmath1 .",
    "the high luminosity is supported by the strong oi7773  ir  triplet whose equivalent width of 1.14corresponds to an absolute visual magnitude of m@xmath88mag .",
    "the radial velocities ( v@xmath9 ) measured from the absorption line cores vary with time and with the line intensity .",
    "the weakest lines give v@xmath9 lower than v@xmath10=@xmath1111kms@xmath6 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* klochkova & chentsov 2004 ) ) by 5 , 14 and 15kms@xmath6 in 2001 , 2003 , 2006 , respectively , suggesting a variable expansion rate of the layers where they form .",
    "the left panel of fig.[s4 - 11_fig1 ] shows that the h@xmath2 profile varies with time , but its principal features are preserved : a strong bell - shaped emission , with a dip at the short - wavelength slope , a sheared peak , and extended thompson wings .",
    "the blue - shifted absorption is barely visible in june  2001 and is more pronounced in april  2003 , but can be traced at least to v@xmath9=@xmath11160kms@xmath6 in both cases ; i.e. , to the same limit that is reached by the blue wings of the absorption lines of siii and hei ( the latter shown in the right panel of fig.[s4 - 11_fig1 ] ) .",
    "the wind terminal velocity is @xmath12 150kms@xmath6 .",
    "the intensity inversions in the upper part of the h@xmath2 profile indicate that the wind is not uniform .",
    "in addition to the high velocity material mentioned above , it contains a fair amount of material that is nearly stationary relative to the star or is even falling onto the stellar surface .",
    "coexistence of lines with direct and inverse pcygni profiles in the same spectrum , and even combinations of such features in the profile of the same line leads us to reject a spherical symmetry wind .",
    "it is possible that the slow part of the wind also contributes to the absorption profiles .",
    "so far , this possibility is supported by the coincident velocities for the central dips of the h@xmath2 line and the well - formed cores of strong absorption lines ( hei5876  in 2001 and siii6347  in 2003 ) , as well as by the fact that the blue shift of all the absorption lines in the 2003 spectrum relative to their positions in 2001 was accompanied by a similar shift of the central dip in h@xmath2 . at any rate ,",
    "both the hydrogen lines and the strongest absorption lines in the visual spectrum cygob2  no.12 are partially formed in the wind ."
