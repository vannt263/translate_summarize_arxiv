    "a traditional belief is that an adequate description of quantum gravity is necessarily complicated , and that we are very far from a satisfying explanation of its true physical content .",
    "this might be correct , however progress on the problems in quantum gravity are being made , and gravitational interactions are today better understood than previously .",
    "the fate of gravity in the limit of planckian scale energies is still unknown . at the physical transition to such energies @xmath1 gev",
    ", fundamental issues are believed to arise .",
    "they concern the validity of the conceptual picture of space and time geometry",
    ". a completely new understanding of physics might be the consequence .",
    "string theory or the so called @xmath5-theory are candidates for such theories in high energy physics .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity on the other hand presents us with an excellent classical model for the interactions of matter and space - time in the low energy regime of physics .",
    "astronomical observations support the theoretical predictions , and there are no experimental reasons for a disbelief in the physical foundations of general relativity . the fact that general relativity is not a quantum theory is however intriguing",
    ". a fundamental description of nature should either be completely classical or quantum mechanical from a theoretical point of view , and so far experiments support quantum mechanics as the correct basis for interpreting physical measurements .",
    "it would be nice to unify einstein s theory in the classical low energy limit with a full quantum field theoretic description in the high energy limit .",
    "this seems not to be immediately possible , attempts of making a quantum field theoretic description of general relativity have normally proven to be incomplete in regard to the question of renormalizability of the fundamental action for the theory .",
    "the basic four - dimensional einstein - hilbert action : @xmath6 is not renormalizable in the sense that the counter - terms which appear in the renormalized action , _",
    "e.g. _ , ( @xmath7 ) , ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 can not be absorbed in the original action  @xcite . in the above equation ( @xmath10 )",
    "is defined as ( @xmath11 ) , where ( @xmath12 ) is the @xmath0-dimensional newton constant .",
    "the disappointing conclusion is usually that a field theoretical treatment of gravity is not possible , and that one should avoid attempting such a description .",
    "effective field theory presents a solution to the renormalization problem of gravity .",
    "it initially originates from an idea put forward by weinberg  @xcite . including all possible invariants into the action , _",
    "i.e. _ , replacing the basic @xmath0-dimensional einstein - hilbert action with : @xmath13 solves the issue of renormalizability .",
    "no counter terms can be generated in a covariant renormalization scheme , which are not already present in the action .",
    "the effective field theory approach will always lead to consistent renormalizable theories in any dimension , _",
    "e.g. _ , for ( @xmath14 ) , ( @xmath15 ) or even ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is important to note that in regard to its renormalizability , an effective field theory in the large-@xmath0 limit of gravity is just as well defined as the planar diagram large-@xmath17 limit , in e.g. , a @xmath18 yang - mills theory . a yang - mills theory , at ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "will also need to be treated by means of effective field theory in order to be renormalizable .",
    "what we give up in the effective field treatment of gravity or in any other theory , is the finite number of terms in the action .",
    "the einstein action is replaced with an action which has an infinite number of coupling constants .",
    "these have to be renormalized at each loop order .",
    "the coupling constants of the effective expansion of the action , _",
    "i.e. _ , ( @xmath20 ) , will have to be determined by experiment and are running , _",
    "i.e. _ , they will depend on the energy scale .",
    "however , the advantage of the effective approach is quite clear .",
    "quantum gravity is an effectively renormalizable theory up to the energies at the planck scale !",
    "the effective field theory description of general relativity has directly shown its worth by explicit calculations of quantum corrections to the metric and to the newtonian potential of large masses .",
    "this work was pioneered by donoghue , refs .",
    "@xcite , and as an effective field theory combined with qed , refs .  @xcite .",
    "the conceptual picture of einstein gravity is not affected by the effective field theory treatment of the gravitational interactions .",
    "the equations of motion will of course be slightly changed by the presence of higher derivative terms in the action , however the contributions coming from such terms can at normal energies be shown to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "effective field theory thus provides us with a very solid framework in the study of gravitational interactions and quantum effects at normal energies , and solves some of the essential problems in building field theoretical quantum gravity models .    an intriguing paper by strominger  @xcite deals with the perspectives of basic einstein gravity at an infinite number of dimensions .",
    "the basic idea is to let the spatial dimension be a parameter in which one is allowed to expand the theory .",
    "each graph of the theory is then associated with a dimensional factor .",
    "formally one can expand every greens function of the theory as a series in @xmath2 and the gravitational coupling constant ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 the contributions with highest dimensional dependence will be the leading ones in the large-@xmath0 limit . concentrating on these graphs",
    "only simplifies the theory and makes explicit calculations easier . in the effective field theory",
    "we expect an expansion of the theory of the type : @xmath23 where ( @xmath24 ) represents a parameter for the effective expansion of the theory in terms of the energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , each derivative acting on a massless field will correspond to a factor of ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the basic einstein - hilbert scale will correspond to the ( @xmath25 ) contribution , while higher order effective contributions will be of order ( @xmath26 ) , ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 etc .",
    "the idea of making a large-@xmath0 expansion in gravity is somewhat similar to the large-@xmath17 yang - mills planar diagram limit considered by t hooft  @xcite . in large-@xmath17 gauge theories ,",
    "one expands in the internal symmetry index ( @xmath17 ) of the gauge group , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "the physical interpretations of the two expansions are of course completely dissimilar , _",
    "e.g. _ , the number of dimensions in a theory can not really be compared to the internal symmetry index of a gauge theory . a comparison of the yang mills large-@xmath17 limit ( the planar diagram limit ) , and the large-@xmath0 expansion in gravity is however still interesting to perform , and as an example of a similarity between the two expansions the leading graphs in the large-@xmath0 limit in gravity consists of a subset of planar diagrams .",
    "higher dimensional models for gravity are well known from string and supergravity theories .",
    "the mysterious @xmath5-theory has to exist in an 11-dimensional space - time .",
    "so there are many good reasons to believe that on fundamental scales , we might experience additional space - time dimensions .",
    "additional dimensions could be treated as free or as compactified below the planck scale , as in the case of a kaluza - klein mechanism .",
    "one application of the large-@xmath0 expansion in gravity could be to approximate greens functions at finite dimension , _ e.g. _ , ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the successful and various uses of the planar diagram limit in yang - mills theory might suggest other possible scenarios for the applicability of the large-@xmath0 expansion in gravity .",
    "for example , is effective quantum gravity renormalizable in its leading large-@xmath0 limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , is it renormalizable in the same way as some non - renormalizable theories are renormalizable in their planar diagram limit ?",
    "it could also be , that quantum gravity at large-@xmath0 is a completely different theory , than einstein gravity .",
    "a planar diagram limit is essentially a string theory at large distances , _",
    "i.e. _ , could gravity at large-@xmath0 be interpreted as a large distance truncated string limit ?",
    "we will here combine the successful effective field theory approach which holds in any dimension , with the expansion of gravity in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    ". the treatment will be mostly conceptual , but we will also address some of the phenomenological issues of this theory .",
    "the structure of the paper will be as follows .",
    "first we will discuss the basic quantization of the einstein - hilbert action , and then we will go on with the large-@xmath0 behavior of gravity , _ i.e. _ , we will show how to derive a consistent limit for the leading graphs .",
    "the effective extension of the theory will be taken up in the large-@xmath0 framework , and we will especially focus on the implications of the effective extension of the theory in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional space - time integrals will then be briefly looked upon , and we will make a conceptual comparison of the large-@xmath0 in gravity and the large-@xmath17 limit in gauge theory . here we will point out some similarities and some dissimilarities of the two theories .",
    "we will also discuss some issues in the original paper by strominger , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will work in units : @xmath31 , and metric : @xmath32 , _ i.e. _ , with @xmath33 minus signs .",
    "in this section we will review the main idea . to begin we",
    "will formally describe how to quantize a gravitational theory .",
    "as is well known the @xmath0-dimensional einstein - hilbert lagrangian has the form : @xmath34 if we neglect the renormalization problems of this action , it is possible to make a formal quantization using the path integral approach .",
    "introducing a gauge breaking term in the action will fix the gauge , and because gravity is a non - abelian theory we have to introduce a proper faddeev - popov ghost action as well .",
    "the action for the quantized theory will consequently be : @xmath35 where ( @xmath36 ) is the gauge fixing term , and ( @xmath37 ) is the ghost contribution . in order to generate vertex rules for this theory an expansion of the action has to be carried out , and vertex rules have to be extracted from the gauge fixed action .",
    "the vertices will depend on the gauge choice and on how we define the gravitational field .",
    "it is conventional to define : @xmath38 and work in harmonic gauge : ( @xmath39 ) . for this gauge choice",
    "the vertex rules for the 3- and 4-point einstein vertices can be found in  @xcite .",
    "yet another possibility is to use the background field method , here we define : @xmath40 and expand the quantum fluctuation : ( @xmath41 ) around an external source , the background field : ( @xmath42 ) . in the background field approach",
    "we have to differ between vertices with internal lines ( quantum lines : @xmath43 ) and external lines ( external sources : @xmath44 ) .",
    "there are no real problems in using either method ; it is mostly a matter of notation and conventions . here",
    "we will concentrate our efforts on the conventional approach .",
    "in many loop calculations the background field method is the easiest to employ .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for additional details about , _",
    "e.g. _ , the vertex rules in the background field method .",
    "another possibility is to define : @xmath45 this field definition makes a transformation of the einstein - hilbert action into the following form : @xmath46 in , ( @xmath14 ) , this form of the einstein - hilbert action is known as the goldberg action  @xcite . in this description of the einstein - hilbert action its dimensional dependence is more obvious .",
    "it is however more cumbersome to work with in the course of practical large-@xmath0 considerations .    in the standard expansion of the action",
    "the propagator for gravitons take the form : @xmath47}{k^2-i\\epsilon}.\\ ] ] the 3- and 4-point vertices for the standard expansion of the einstein - hilbert action can be found in  @xcite and has the following form : @xmath48 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] in the above two expressions , @xmath50 , means that each pair of indices : ( @xmath51 ) , ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath28 will have to be symmetrized .",
    "the momenta factors : ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath28 ) are associated with the index pairs : ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath28 ) correspondingly . the symbol : ( @xmath55 ) means that a @xmath56-permutation of indices and corresponding momenta has to carried out for this particular term . as seen",
    "the algebraic structures of the 3- and 4-point vertices are already rather involved and complicated .",
    "5-point vertices will not be considered explicitly in this paper .",
    "the explicit prefactors of the terms in the vertices will not be essential in this treatment .",
    "the various algebraic structures which constitutes the vertices will be more important .",
    "different algebraic terms in the vertex factors will generate dissimilar traces in the final diagrams .",
    "it is useful to adapt an index line notation for the vertex structure similar to that used in large-@xmath17 gauge theory .    in this notation",
    "we can represent the different algebraic terms of the 3-point vertex ( see figure [ 3vert ] ) .    [ cols= \" < , <",
    ", < , < \" , ]     using the same procedure , we can find expression for non - leading effective contributions , however this will have no implications for the loop contributions .",
    "we have only calculated 3-point effective vertex index structures in this appendix , 4-point index structures are tractable too by the same methods , but the algebra gets much more complicated in this case .",
    "in the large-@xmath0 limit only certain graphs will give leading contributions to the @xmath4-point functions .",
    "the diagrams favored in the large-@xmath0 will have a simpler structure than the full @xmath4-point graphs .",
    "calculations which would be too complicated to do in a full graph limit , might be tractable in the large-@xmath0 regime .",
    "the @xmath4-point contributions in the large-@xmath0 limit are possible to employ in approximations of @xmath4-point functions at any finite dimension , exactly as the @xmath4-point planar diagrams in gauge theories can be used , _",
    "e.g. _ , at ( @xmath57 ) , to approximate @xmath4-point functions . knowing the full @xmath4-point limit is hence very useful in the course of practical approximations of generic @xmath4-point functions at finite ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this appendix will be devoted to the study of what is needed in order calculate @xmath4-point functions in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "-point diagram , the index structure for the external lines is not decided , they can have the momentum structure , ( i.e. , as in ( 3c ) ) , or they can be of the contracted type , ( i.e. , as in ( 3b ) ) .",
    "external lines can of course also originate from 4-point vertex or a higher vertex index structure such as , e.g. , the index structures ( 4d ) or ( 4e ) .",
    "this possibility will however not affect the arguments in this appendix , so we will leave this as a technical issue to be dealt with in explicit calculations of @xmath4-point functions.[n - point],height=45 ]        more generically the large-@xmath0 , @xmath17-loop corrections to the @xmath4-point function will consist of combinations of leading bubble and vertex - loop contributions , such as shown in figure [ larged ] .    for the bubble contributions it is seen that all loops are completely separated .",
    "therefore everything is known once the 1-loop contributions are calculated .",
    "that is , in order to derive the full @xmath4-point sole bubble contribution it is seen that if we know all @xmath58-point tree graphs , as well as all @xmath59-point 1-loop graphs ( where , @xmath60 ) are known , the derivation the full bubble contribution is a matter of contractions of diagrams and combinatorics .    for the vertex - loop combinations the structure of the contributions",
    "are a bit more complicated to analyze .",
    "the loops will in this case be connected through the vertices , not via propagators , and the integrals can therefore be joined together by contractions of the their loop momenta .",
    "however , this does in fact not matter ; we can still do the diagrams if we know all integrals which occurs in the generic 1-loop @xmath4-point function .",
    "the integrals in the vertex - loop diagrams will namely be of completely the same type as the bubble diagram integrals .",
    "there will be no shared propagator lines which will combine the denominators of the integrals .",
    "the algebraic contractions of indices will however be more complicated to do for vertex - loop diagrams than for sole bubble loop diagrams .",
    "multiple index contractions from products of various integrals will have to be carried out in order to do these types of diagrams .",
    "computer algebraic manipulations can be employed to do the algebra in the diagrams , so we will not focus on that here .",
    "the real problem lays in the mathematical problem calculating generic @xmath4-point integrals .    in the einstein - hilbert case , where each vertex can add only two powers of momentum",
    ", we see that problem of this diagram is about doing integrals such as : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 because the graviton is a massless particle such integrals will be rather badly defined .",
    "the denominators in the integrals are close to zero , and this makes the integrals divergent .",
    "one way to deal with these integrals is to use the following parametrization of the propagator : @xmath65 and define the momentum integral over a complex @xmath66-dimensional euclidian space - time .",
    "thus , what is left to do is gaussian integrals in a @xmath66-dimensional complex space - time .",
    "methods to do such types of integrals are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the results for : ( @xmath67 ) , ( @xmath68 ) , ( @xmath69 ) and ( @xmath70 ) are in fact explicitly stated there .",
    "it is outside our scope to actually delve into technicalities about explicit mathematical manipulations of integrals , but it should be clear that mathematical methods to deal with the 1-loop @xmath4-point integral types exist and that this could an working area for further research .",
    "effective field theory will add more derivatives to the loops , thus the nominator will carry additional momentum contributions .",
    "additional integrals will hence have to be carried out in order to do explicit diagrams in an effective field theory framework .",
