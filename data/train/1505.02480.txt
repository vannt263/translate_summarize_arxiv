    "two - dimensional simulations on protoplanetary discs have shown that anti - cyclonic vortices are long - lived ( godon & livio 1999 ) , and that such vortices can concentrate dust particles significantly ( barge & sommeria 1995 ; adams & watkins 1995 ; tanga et al .  1996 ; godon & livio 2000 ) , perhaps thereby facilitating planetesimal formation .    however , as dust concentrates in the vortex , it becomes more and more critical to consider the dust feedback .",

    "the gas disc was simulated with athena ( stone et al .",

    "dust particles were simulated with the particle integrator in athena ( bai & stone 2010 ) .",
    "dust particles were implemented as lagrangian particles with the dust - gas coupling drag term , following @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the velocity vectors for particle @xmath8 and the gas , @xmath9 is the gravitational force experienced by particle @xmath8 , and @xmath10 is the stopping time for this particle due to gas drag .",
    "the dimensionless stopping time @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 . in this work , we chose the triangular - shaped cloud ( tsc ) interpolation scheme to interpolate the gas properties and dust feedback force at the particle position .",
    "we use the semi - implicit scheme to integrate particle orbits .",
    "+ the simulations were conducted using the shearing box approximation .",
    "the box extends from -0.5 h to 0.5 h with 256 cells in the x - direction ( r - direction ) and -h to h with 512 cells in the y - direction ( @xmath13-direction ) , where h is the disc scale height ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we tested this choice of resolution by running diagnostic tests at double the resolution ( 512 by 1024 ) and observed no significant change , leading us to believe that our current resolution was sufficient .",
    "we applied periodic boundary conditions in the y - direction . to avoid wave reflection from x boundaries , densities and velocities of ghost zones at x boundaries",
    "were fixed at the initial values ( as in zhu et al .",
    "we set up the kida vortex by initializing the disc structure as @xmath15 for the region within the ellipse described by @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the semi - minor and semi - major axes . in the kida solution , @xmath18 ( chavanis 2000 ) . beyond this region",
    ", we assumed that the difference between the speed given by ( [ eq : vortex2 ] ) and the keplerian speed decreases exponentially as exp(-@xmath19 ) where @xmath20 is the distance between the vortex centre and the vortex streamline in the @xmath21 direction . in this study",
    "we choose @xmath22 h and @xmath23=4 .",
    "lyra & lin ( 2013 ) has a good discussion of the difference between the kida solution and the goodmannarayangoldreich solution .",
    "we note that for our choice of @xmath23 , the solutions are quite similar .",
    "we initially applied a small viscosity ( @xmath24 ) to stabilize the vortex by damping any oscillations or sound waves generated by discretizing the incompressible kida solution for use in our compressible grid .",
    "after 10 orbits when the vortex is stable , the viscosity was set to be 0 .",
    "all runs were conducted to 100 orbits .",
    "the main set of simulations were conducted to explore the parameter phase space given by varying the ratio of solid mass to gas mass , @xmath25 , in the disc and the stopping time of the particles .",
    "we chose seven @xmath25 from 0.01 to 1 ( @xmath260.01 , 0.0215 , 0.0464 , 0.1 , 0.215 , 0.464 , and 1 ) , representative of regions of the protoplanetary disc that had already been subject to some solid concentration , either by vertical or radial transport .",
    "the lower limit @xmath27 is the ism dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "the upper limit @xmath28 represents a vortex in a region that has already undergone significant solid concentration or even streaming instability .",
    "+ we also explored the parameter phase space along the stopping time dimension .",
    "barge and sommeria ( 1995 ) showed that the stopping time is the single parameter that characterizes particle concentration in the vortex .",
    "the stopping time is dependent on the ratio of mass and the size of the particle .",
    "our exploration of stopping time was centered on @xmath11 = 1 .",
    "we extended this dimension of the phase space @xmath29 over 3 simulations in each direction from 0.0316 to 31.6 , which captured the limiting behavior in either direction .",
    "+ thus , we have conducted 7@xmath307 ( 49 ) simulations to explore our phase space , varying the mass ratio and stopping time respectively .",
    "the long - term stability of vortices for each set of parameters is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the left panel shows the vorticity of all runs at 100 orbits . since all vortices with @xmath31",
    "are destroyed after 100 orbits , we do not show those cases in this plot . throughout the paper ,",
    "the vorticity is defined as @xmath32 , so that the vorticity due to the keplerian shear has been removed . when the dust to gas mass ratio increases , there is a change in the stability of vortices near @xmath33 . at high @xmath25 ,",
    "only vortices with very large or small @xmath34 are stable . at very low stopping times the dust and gas",
    "are totally coupled , while for very large stopping times the dust and gas are uncoupled .",
    "both extremes engender stability .",
    "however , particles with @xmath35 sink to the vortex centre fastest ( chavanis 2000 ) and these vortices are the least stable , requiring @xmath36 for stability .",
    "this indicates that for vortices in accretion discs with higher solid mass density , stability is heavily constrained .    even in cases in which the vortex is destroyed by the dust feedback",
    ", there is a region of high dust concentration .",
    "this high dust concentration is produced by the vortex before it is destroyed by feedback .",
    "thus , even if the vortex is a transient phenomenon , it can still lead to very high dust concentration . with a small initial dust to gas mass ratio",
    ", the vortex can survive over 100 orbits independent on the size of the particle in the disc . however",
    ", the structure of the vortex does depend on the size of the particle within the vortex . with small particles ( @xmath37 ) in the vortex , the vortex centre has a minimum vorticity . with big particles ( @xmath38 ) in the vortex ,",
    "the vorticity starts to increase towards the vortex centre .",
    "this difference has important applications on dust distribution in vortices , which will be discussed in  4 .    for the smallest particles ( @xmath39 ) in a stable vortex ( the uppermost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , we have seen `` fingers '' at the vortex edge , indicating some instability for well - coupled particles . we notice that in a recent paper by fu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , a similar phenomenon has been observed .",
    "this instability may be due to the `` heavy core instability '' suggested by chang & oishi ( 2010 ) or parametric instability for dust - laden vortices suggested by railton & papaloizou ( 2014 ) .",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the vorticity of an unstable vortex to understand how decay proceeds . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stablevsunstable ] the vortex quickly starts to stretch in the y direction until it is strongly deformed .",
    "this stretch is a consequence of the vortex s own rotational motion becoming slow compared to the shear flow , which is constant through the life of the vortex .",
    "once its own vorticity is no longer large compared to the shear flow , the vortex is simply pulled apart by the shear flow , whereas a stable vortex eventually develops a hole as it fills its core with dust but keeps spinning relative to the shear flow . for dust with @xmath38 , the regions of largest spin are at mid - radial distances , as the vortex slows down around its dust core .",
    "thus , we conclude that even initially stable vortices can not continue to increase the amount of dust they accumulate indefinitely , or they will approach the critical value of dust to gas ratio identified in  3.3 and destroy themselves .          as particles concentrate within the vortex , the dust feedback weakens and eventually destroys the vortex . to quantify the weakening of the vortex , fig .",
    "[ fig : denvort1d ] shows the minimum vorticity ( left panels ) and the averaged dust - to - gas mass ratio ( right panels ) within the vortex region .",
    "the averaged dust - to - gas mass ratio within the vortex is calculated by summing all the dust mass within the vortex region and dividing this total dust mass by the total gas mass in the same region .",
    "the vortex region is defined to be an ellipse with a semi - major axis of 0.4 h and a semi - minor axis of 0.1 h around the vortex centre . in each panel ,",
    "darker curves represent cases with smaller initial dust - to - gas mass ratios .",
    "the solid curves represent the cases where the vortices are still present at 100 orbits while the dotted curves represent the cases where vortices are destroyed within 100 orbits .",
    "clearly , when the vortex is destroyed , the vorticity reaches zero quickly .",
    "again , we have observed that the feedback from small dust ( e.g. , @xmath11=0.0316 ) leads to a smaller vorticity at the vortex centre while the feedback from large dust ( e.g. , @xmath11=31.6 ) leads to a bigger vorticity .",
    "[ fig : denvort1d ] also suggests that the survival of the vortex seems to depend only on the averaged dust - to - gas mass ratio within the vortex , independent of the dust stopping time .",
    "for all three @xmath11 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : denvort1d ] , the vortex survives over 100 orbits when the averaged dust - to - gas mass ratio within the vortex ( right panels ) is smaller than 10@xmath400.3 , while larger dust - to - gas mass ratios lead to vortex destruction .",
    "we have identified important differences in the feedback caused by small and large dust particles . in a real protoplanetary disc ,",
    "small and large dust coexist in the disc .",
    "however , the gas will be primarily affected by certain sizes of dust .",
    "the feedback force from a certain sized dust to the gas is the product of the dust abundance and the drag force of each dust particle .",
    "generally , a dust species with a higher abundance will have a bigger effect on the gas .",
    "on the other hand , dust with large stopping time will not affect gas significantly .",
    "overall , when the gas structure has been altered by the feedback from the most important dust species , the modified gas structure will affect the distribution of dust at other sizes .    assuming ism dust distribution @xmath41 in protoplanetary disks , we know that large dust normally dominates most of the dust mass .",
    "if this large dust has @xmath38 , it can make the vorticity increase towards the vortex centre ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . with a vorticity close to zero",
    ", the vortex centre becomes quiescent and small particles can not concentrate to the vortex centre .",
    "instead , they will pile up around the vortex centre to form a ring structure .",
    "such anti - correlation between small and big dust may be able to explain the discrepancy of azimuthal structure between submm and near - ir scattered light observations for oph ir 48 ( follette et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in order to explore this interesting possibility ,",
    "we have carried out a simulation with particles having a large range of sizes from @xmath11=0.01 to 31.6 with a size distribution of @xmath42 .",
    "the total dust - to - gas mass ratio is 0.03 . in this case , most of the dust mass is in big particles .",
    "the gas vorticity and dust distribution at 50 orbits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multipargen ] .",
    "as expected , since large dust concentrates in the vortex centre , the dust feedback makes the vorticity approach 0 at the vortex centre .",
    "this prevents small dust from concentrating in the vortex centre . instead , the small particles form a ring around the vortex centre .",
    "the vortex is gradually weakened by the feedback , and as it becomes more elongated , the ring structure of the small particles also elongates .",
    "the implications of these particle distributions are discussed in  4.2 .          by comparing alma synthetic images based on simulations with alma observations towards oph irs 48 ( van der marel et al .",
    "2014 ) and hd 142527 ( casassus et al . 2013 ) , zhu & stone ( 2014 ) point out that the vortex centre in these observations may be optically thick . since in regions that are optically thick , the intensity is no longer proportional to the total dust mass , it is important to know the fraction of the vortex region that is optically thick .",
    "thus , we show the dust surface density in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] .",
    "the figure indicates that the maximum dust density within a stable vortex can reach @xmath43100 , even though this only occurs in a small region around the vortex centre .",
    "as expected , particles with @xmath441 reach the largest concentration at the vortex centre . by assigning an opacity to the particles , we know the @xmath45 beyond which the vortex becomes optically thick . then with fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] , we can estimate how much is hidden in the optically thick region .",
    "we also note that such high concentration at the vortex centre can lead to gravitational instability to form planetesimals or even planets ( barge and sommeria 1995 ) .     for stable vortices with @xmath11=0.0316 , 1 , and 31.6 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in our main set of simulations , we initialized the vortex with a semi - minor axis of 0.06 h. in order to explore how the vortex size affects our results , we carried out a similar set of simulations with a vortex 5 times bigger ( @xmath46x=0.3 h ) .",
    "the whole simulation domain was thus adjusted to [ -2.5h , 2.5h]@xmath30[-5h , 5h ] . to save the computational cost , we only set the mass ratio ( @xmath25 ) to be @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the dust stopping time ( @xmath11 ) to be @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 , all other parameters , including grid numbers and simulation time , are the same as our main set of simulations .",
    "we again found that vortices with @xmath54 are unstable .",
    "similar to fig .",

    "[ fig : denvort1dbig ] shows that the vortex is destroyed when the averaged dust - to - gas mass ratio within the vortex is larger than @xmath550.3 .",

    "this concentration is produced by the vortex before it is destroyed by feedback .",
    "thus , even if the vortex is a transient phenomenon , it can still lead to very high dust concentrations .",

    "such anticorrelation between small and large dust within vortices may explain the discrepancy between alma and near - ir scattered light observations in the asymmetric region of transitional discs .",
    "* we find that the dust density can be more than 100 times larger than the gas density at the vortex centre , potentially facilitating planetesimal and planet formation .",
    "however , we caution that our 2-d simulations have not considered the 3-d structure of the vortex and how vertical transport affects particle distributions",
    ". these questions of 3-d structure deserve future study .",
    "additionally , we have ignored the radial drift of the particles in our simulations .",
    "we note that the vortices we study tend to appear at density bumps , due to their formation by the rossby wave instability for example .",
