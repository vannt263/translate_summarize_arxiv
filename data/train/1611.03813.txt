    "more recently an eit - like phenomenon was observed in the emission spectrum of a system of two resonant meta - atoms in a cavity as a response to an incident microwave  @xcite .",

    "we should also mention the class of material media , commonly reported as _ smart glasses _ , whose optical properties can continuously run from opacity to transparency and back according with an externally controllable field imposed to the medium @xcite .    the aim of this work",
    "is to provide , for a given class of dielectric media and restricted to the limit of applicability of geometrical optics , a theoretical description of the electromagnetically tunable optical opacity - to - transparency phase transition , while still relying upon the basic phenomenological properties of the medium .",

    "the next section presents the derivation of the fresnel equation for light propagation in a non dispersive nonlinear medium by using the hadamard method for field discontinuities . from the requirement of the existence of non - trivial solutions for the fresnel equation , sec .",
    "[ suff - opac ] deals with the geometric properties ( speed and polarization ) of the light rays , and establishes sufficient conditions for the occurrence of opacity in a non - magnetic medium . furthermore , in this section we present and briefly discuss the effective metric that corresponds to the class of optical systems here considered . in sec .  [ models ] , simple models for the permittivity of the medium are investigated , and the way to control the opacity by means of an externally applied electric field is given . a very similar effect can also be obtained in cases for which the medium reacts nonlinearly to the presence of an external magnetic field , as it is shown in sec .",

    "in fact , the chosen values for the electric and magnetic fields are such that the medium satisfies a sort of non - birefringence condition @xcite .    in order to study a specific case ,",
    "let us set @xmath205 .",
    "in this case we obtain that @xmath206\\big[\\cos^2\\theta \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 3\\gamma\\,\\sin^2\\theta -\\frac{\\sqrt3}{2}(1+\\gamma)\\sin\\,(2\\theta)\\cos\\varphi\\big]^{-1 } , \\label{veb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that the system presents opacity for small values of the angle @xmath105 for a range of the angle @xmath125 , if @xmath207 .",
    "this solution is depicted for @xmath208 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for some illustrative values of @xmath106 .",
    "the relevance of the two cases with the magnetic field lies in the fact that the propagation ( with reference to the phase velocity only ) can be switched on and off with no change whatsoever in the magnitude of the fields , but varying only their orientation in space .",
    "therefore , the physical device being modeled in these cases can be adjusted to be either transparent or opaque by simply implementing spatial rotations on the system .",
    "we studied some models for nonlinear electromagnetic material media which , in the regime of geometrical optics , do present phase transitions between optical transparency and opacity , and vice - versa .",
    "these models were chosen to be mathematically simple , and were mostly motivated by the present day technological capability of designing and producing metamaterials whose properties can be set to meet pre - stablished requirements .    we do not present a complete analysis of this phenomenon in nonlinear media . instead , we just present the method by which such phenomenon can be investigated . in this way , the theoretical description we present here could be a valuable tool in searching for new optical devices and effects . depending on",
    "the external applied electric and magnetic fields , which couple to the dielectric properties of the medium by means its optical susceptibilities , opacity and transparency may occur in each studied model for certain directions of propagation of a probe electromagnetic wave .",
    "the models can be adapted to different situations , in order to yield the effect around specific directions of the wave propagation .",
    "another possible application of the present method would be the production of models presenting low values for light velocity around certain directions of propagation .",
    "a simple example is the model for electromagnetic switchable media investigated in sec .",
    "[ electromag ] , with a specific example depicted in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "propagation with directions near @xmath190 present quite low speed .",
    "slow light phenomena is an interesting tool to investigate some aspects of classical and quantum optics , including analog models of general relativity .",
    "in fact , in the context of analog models , slow light systems have been used to simulate black holes in several optical systems .",
    "the main idea is to measure the occurrence of the tiny hawking radiation @xcite , long ago predicted to occur in astrophysical black holes , but its small magnitude renders its direct observation unlikely to occur in the realm of astrophysics .",
    "thus , measuring this curious effect in terrestrial laboratories @xcite by means of analog models seems to be an important starting point to test semiclassical gravity predictions and , perhaps even quantum gravity phenomena .",
    "finally it should be noticed that in all models here examined , but the one studied in sec .",
    "[ electromag ] , birefringence phenomena occur , i.e. , the solutions exhibit two distinct phase velocities along the same direction of the wave vector .",
    "the distinct solutions are associated with different polarization vectors . in all cases where the effect occurs",
    "its magnitude is larger at the center of the transparency windows and falls to zero at the borders .",
    "the branch of material media we are interested in here corresponds to the ones which admit only real elements for the dielectric coefficients .",
    "consequently , the auxiliary matrices @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath209 $ ] possess only real entries , does yielding the existence of at least one real eigenvalue , for each of them .",
    "however , their jordan canonical form can be non - diagonal if the other eigenvalues are complex . recall that it is enough to study the eigenvalues of @xmath99 $ ] in order to know the properties of the generalized fresnel matrix in the case of electric - switchable media with an opacity - to - transparency transition . for simplicity",
    ", we shall analyze here @xmath99 $ ] solely .",
    "the decomposition in terms of the eigenvalues can also be applied to the magnetic - switchable media .",
    "let us denote @xmath210 the eigenvalues of the dimensionless version of @xmath99 $ ] and a basis @xmath211 of real vectors , where @xmath64 labels the vectors and @xmath212 labels the components , with @xmath213 .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the real canonical forms of @xmath99 $ ] , we have to consider two cases in separate : either @xmath214 @xmath215 and @xmath216 , or @xmath217 @xmath218 .    in case @xmath214 : @xmath219 with @xmath220 and the canonical form is @xmath221\\big|_a=\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } x&-y&0\\\\[1ex ] y&x&0\\\\[1ex ] 0&0&\\lambda_3 \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] and for case @xmath217 : we obtain @xmath222\\big|_{b}=\\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } \\lambda_1&0&0\\\\[1ex ] \\delta_1&\\lambda_2&0\\\\[1ex ] 0&\\delta_2&\\lambda_3 \\end{array}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath223 depending on the eigenvalues degeneracy and the number of associated eigenvectors .",
