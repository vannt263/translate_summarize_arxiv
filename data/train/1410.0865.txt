    "we apply  @xcite the full - scale bayesian inference code borg ( bayesian origin reconstruction from galaxies ,  @xcite ) to the galaxies of the ` sample dr72 ` of the new york university value added catalogue ( nyu - vagc  ) , based on the final data release ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the physical model for gravitational dynamics is second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) , linking initial density fields ( @xmath0 ) to the presently observed large - scale structure , in the linear and mildly non - linear regime .",
    "the algorithm explores numerically the posterior distribution by sampling the joint distribution of all parameters involved , via efficient hamiltonian markov chain monte carlo ( hmc ) dynamics .    each sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] , upper panel ) is a `` possible version of the truth '' in the form of a full physical realization of dark matter particles , tracing both the density and the velocity fields .",
    "the variation between samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slices ] , lower panel ) quantifies joint and correlated uncertainties ( survey geometry , selection effects , biases , noise ) inherent to any cosmological observation .",
    "we generate  @xcite a set of data - constrained realizations of the present large - scale structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slices_filter ] ) : some samples of inferred primordial conditions are evolved with 2lpt to @xmath2 , then with a fully non - linear cosmological simulation ( using gadget-2 ,  @xcite ) from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "a dynamic , non - linear physical model naturally introduces some correlations between the constrained and unconstrained parts , which yields reliable extrapolations for certain aspects of the model that have not yet been constrained by the data ( e.g. near the survey boundaries or at high redshift ) .",
    "we apply  @xcite vide ( the void identification and examination toolkit ,   @xcite  ) to the constrained parts of these realizations .",
    "the void finder is a modified version of zobov  @xcite that uses voronoi tessellations of the tracer particles to estimate the density field and a watershed algorithm to group voronoi cells into voids .",
    "we find physical cosmic voids in the field traced by the dark matter particles , probing a level deeper in the mass distribution hierarchy than galaxies , and greatly alleviating the bias problem for cosmological interpretation of final results . due to the high density of tracers , we find about an order of magnitude more voids at all scales than the voids directly traced by the sdss galaxies ( fig . [",
    "fig : voids ] , left panel ) , which sample the underlying mass distribution only sparsely  @xcite .",
    "our inference framework therefore yields a drastic reduction of statistical uncertainty in voids catalogs . for usual voids statistics such as radial density profiles of stacked voids ( observed in simulations to be of universal character ,",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , the results we obtain are consistent with @xmath4-body simulations prepared with the same setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : voids ] , right panel ) .",
