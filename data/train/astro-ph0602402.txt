    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are persistent , pulsed x - ray sources that sporadically enter burst active episodes , or outbursts , lasting anywhere from a few weeks to several months .",
    "these outbursts in sgrs are composed of ordinary , repetitive bursts and , in rare cases , flares .",
    "the common bursts typically last @xmath40.1 s and reach peak luminosities up to @xmath410@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 , while the flares have longer durations ( up to @xmath45 minutes ) and generally higher peak luminosities reaching @xmath410@xmath7 ergs s@xmath6 . from the relatively dim persistent x - ray emission ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ergs s@xmath6 ) to the brightest flares ,",

    "it is generally believed that sgrs and axps are magnetars ( thompson & duncan 1995 , 1996 ) , neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields of order @xmath10 g ( kouveliotou et al .  1998 ) , whose bright x - ray emission is powered by the decay of the strong field . the persistent x - ray emission from magnetars",
    "is believed to be due to magnetospheric currents driven by twists in the evolving magnetic field ( thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni 2002 ) and thermal emission from the stellar surface ( zel 2003 ; ho & lai 2003 ; zane et al.2001 ) heated by the decay of the strong field ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",
    "x - ray pulsations arise from anisotropic emission from a stellar surface of presumably non - uniform temperature in combination with strong gradients in the photon opacity versus magnetic latitude ( thompson et al .",

    "2005 ) show that the energy output is dominated by the non - thermal ( magnetospheric ) component .",
    "their burst emission results from either a build up of magnetic stress and eventual release of this energy through fracturing of the crust ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) or by magnetic reconnection within the stellar magnetosphere ( lyutikov 2003 ) . in both burst trigger schemes , the result is a trapped pair - photon fireball which cools and radiates giving rise to the burst .    burst active episodes in sgr  1900@xmath114 , in particular outbursts containing flares , have shown a measureable impact on the spectral and temporal properties of the underlying persistent x - ray source .",
    "for example , sgr  1900@xmath114  entered a phase of intense burst activity in 1998 may that included a giant flare recorded on 1998 august 27 ( hurley et al .  1999 ; feroci et al .",
    "early in this outburst ( may @xmath0 june ) , the pulsed flux from the sgr was enhanced by a factor @xmath42 above its nominal pre - outburst level ( woods et al .",
    "unfortunately , there was a three month gap in pointed x - ray observations of the source prior to the giant flare , so very little is known about the pre - flare flux evolution . during and following the flare , there was a sudden rise in the soft x - ray persistent / pulsed flux from the sgr and a dramatic change in pulse shape ( woods et al .",
    "2001 ) . the flux increase , or x - ray afterglow , decayed rapidly as a power - law in time over the next @xmath440 days and has been attributed to the heating of the outer crust of a neutron star with a 10@xmath11 g surface field ( lyubarsky , eichler & thompson 2002 ) .",
    "the pulse profile change , however , has persisted for at least three years following the flare , likely indicative of a sustained rearrangement of the external field geometry ( woods et al .",

    "there are a handful of exceptions to this rule caused ordinarily by rapid response to too triggers and the inability to change data modes on a very short timescale . for the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) instrument ,",
    "the data used here were acquired in either e_8us_256_dx1f or e_8us_256_dx0f mode , ordinarily without rocking the hexte clusters ( i.e.  staring mode ) .",

    "we will include an independent analysis of this data set here for completeness . in each of these observations , the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) was used as the focal - plane detector .",

    "the acis chips were operated in continuous clocking ( cc ) mode which sacrifices one dimension of spatial resolution for improved time resolution of 2.85 ms .",

    "the improved agreement between the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  results for the simultaneous fit with a linked column density suggests that the instrumental `` discrepancy '' we noted originally is likely due to strong coupling of the spectral parameters in combination with slight differences in the instrumental response functions of the two instruments .",

    "the increased spectral hardness was evidenced in both the thermal and non - thermal components of the spectrum .",
    "interestingly , each began to show changes in early 2003  more than one year prior to the giant flare ( vertical dotted line ) .",
    "as with the torque on the star , the peaks ( valley ) in these three spectral parameters appear to precede the flare itself .",
    "we fitted the blackbody temperature and photon index measurements between mjd 52700 and 53700 to a quadradic and measured centroids of 53280@xmath1840 and 53160@xmath1860 , respectively .",
    "the x - ray flux was more peaked , so we limited our fit range to mjd 53000 to 53500 and measured a centroid of 53296@xmath188 .",

    "the far more numerous pca pulsed fluxes provide a more comprehensive picture of the flux evolution of the sgr over the last decade .",

    "bepposax_. assuming that the pulsed fraction of sgr  1806@xmath020  remains constant ( and perfect x - ray detector intercalibration ) , the pca pulsed fluxes on this scale would exactly match all other phase - averaged fluxes . with the exception of the months leading up to and following the giant flare , there is generally good agreement between the two .",
    "the post - flare disparity is clearly due to the sudden drop in pulsed fraction ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the pre - flare mismatch could be due to a change in the energy dependence of the pulsed fraction during the flux rise .",
    "low - level changes in the pulsed flux of sgr  1806@xmath020  are evident between 1999 and 2003 , although the largest magnitude changes in flux occurred during the time leading up to and following the giant flare .",
    "a close - up of the flux evolution during this epoch ( figure  [ fig : flux_hist_flare ] ) shows that the flux rose on a timescale of months in the build - up to the flare . as with the torque , spectral hardness and phase - averaged flux , the pulsed flux peaks well before the flare itself on 2004 december 27 . fitting the pulsed flux data between mjd 53000 and 53500 to a quadratic",
    ", we find the centroid at mjd 53227@xmath188 , nearly 5 months prior to the flare .",
    "similar to outbursts in other magnetar candidates , the intense burst activity of sgr  1806@xmath020  in 2004 was accompanied by changes in the persistent and pulsed emission properties of the source .",
    "specifically , we observed a hardening of the x - ray spectrum , large amplitude increases in the pulsed and phase - averaged flux , strong variability in the spin - down rate , and significant changes in the pulse morphology .",
    "the connection between burst activity and the persistent emission of magnetar candidates has allowed us to place constraints on the magnetar model , and at times motivate refinements to the model .",
    "below , we discuss how the changes we observed in the persistent x - ray emission of sgr  1806@xmath020during the 2004 outburst fit within the magnetar model .",
    "mereghetti et al .  (",
    "2005a ) reported a correlation between spectral hardness and spin - down rate ( i.e.  torque ) of sgr  1806@xmath020  for x - ray observations preceding the giant flare .",
    "they report a monotonic increase in spectral hardness from 1993 to 2004 .",
    "our analysis of the data is consistent with their conclusion that the energy spectrum hardens over the last decade , however , we find significant differences in the temporal evolution and consequently the hardness - torque correlation . with regard to the spectral evolution , our universal simultaneous fit shows that the x - ray spectrum does not begin to harden until at least 1999 .",
    "in fact , the data do not show a clear hardening trend until 2003 . from this period through mid-2005",
    ", the photon index steadily flattens with time and the blackbody temperature increases .",
    "our _ rxte _  monitoring observations of sgr  1806@xmath020show that the torque change , on the other hand , was relatively sudden in 2000 taking @xmath41 year to transition to a new equilibrium state where the spin - down rate remained roughly constant until 2004 . only during this @xmath44 year interval of steady",
    ", enhanced torque did the energy spectrum become harder .",
    "if , in fact , the two effects are correlated in sgr  1806@xmath020 , the torque change in year 2000 preceded the gradual hardening of the spectrum as opposed to a monotonic evolution of each parameter in lock - step with the other as suggested by mereghetti et al ..    early in 2004 , the torque on sgr  1806@xmath020  began to increase again reaching a maximum @xmath42 months after the peak in burst rate , but still several months before the flare epoch .",
    "similarly , the energy spectrum peaked in hardness after the burst rate peak and before the flare epoch .",
    "the spectral hardness peak appears to be delayed relative to the torque maximum . as the torque underwent a rapid decline , the energy spectrum followed with a gradual softening .",
    "these trends continued through the flare epoch without deviating .",
    "approximately three months after the flare , the torque reached a local minimum and has since recovered to the pre - flare level of 2001@xmath02004 .",
    "the spectral hardness , on the other hand , has continued to drop and is steadily approaching the pre-2000 spectral shape .    in summary ,",
    "the correlation between torque and spectral hardness is not straightforward .",
    "there is evidence in favor of the torque change in year 2000 preceding , perhaps triggering a gradual hardening of the energy spectrum .",
    "however , the pre - flare drop in torque and its subsequent post - flare recovery resulted in a spectral softening , but no recovery ( as of yet ) in the spectral hardness .",
    "this may indicate some level of histeresis in the system .",
    "a correlation between spectral hardness and torque is expected in the model of thompson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a magnetar with a twisted magnetosphere .",
    "it is hypothesized that a twist is imparted on the magnetosphere from below as residual magnetic field complexities within the interior of the star work their way to the surface and deform the crust in energetically favorable rotational motions .",
    "the subsequent twisting of external field lines caused by this motion amplifies the current along these field lines giving rise to enhanced magnetospheric scattering of x - rays from below , and in the case of open field lines , increased torque on the star . within the context of this model",
    ", the delayed spectral response would indicate that the open field lines near the magnetic poles were first affected by the twist causing the sudden increase in torque .",
    "if only a small bundle of field lines were initially involved , the phase - averaged energy spectrum would not be significantly altered .",
    "assuming the current along closed field lines gradually increased over the next several years , so would the isotropic scattering of x - rays , and , consequently , the spectral hardness .",
    "the pulsed flux of sgr  1806@xmath020  correlates with the torque in the months surrounding the giant flare . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux_torque ] , we show the frequency derivative ( i.e.  torque ) versus pulsed flux between mjd 53050 and 53610 .",
    "the spearman rank order correlation coefficient for this data set is 0.66 which would be expected assuming the null - hypothesis ( i.e.  no correlation ) with a probability of 6 @xmath12 10@xmath19 .",
    "the measurements leading up to the peak in torque on mjd 53209 are indicated by open diamonds and the post - peak measurements are indicated by filled circles .",
    "there is some evidence that the decline in torque is more rapid than the pulsed flux decline since the filled circles reside systematically higher than the open diamonds over the same range in frequency derivative . within the model of thompson",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) , the current flowing along open field lines determines the spin - down rate of the neutron star .",
    "this correlation suggests that the pulsed emission of the sgr is shaped by these currents in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "we note that no such correlation was seen in the epoch surrounding the sudden torque change in 2000 .",
    "it is not clear why this correlation exists only over certain time intervals .",
    "another consequence of crustal twisting would be an increase in burst activity since the bursts are believed to be triggered by crustal fractures and/or magnetospheric reconnection events .",
    "we find that the burst frequency reached a maximum shortly before the peak in spin - down rate in 2004 .",
    "this delay of @xmath42 months could reflect the time scale at which the twist propogates from the stellar surface , presumably where the bursts originate , out to the light cylinder where the torque on the star is influenced . curiously , there is no sudden rise in burst activity at the time of the torque change in 2000 .",
    "magnetospheric currents strongly influence the pulsed intensity and morphology of the persistent x - ray emission from magnetars ( thompson et al .",
    "similar to the giant flare from sgr  1900@xmath114 , the december 27@xmath20 flare from sgr  1806@xmath020  had a lasting impact upon the pulse morphology of the x - ray emission which has persisted for several months following the flare .",
    "the fact that the pulse profile of sgr  1806@xmath020  became more complex following the flare while the sgr  1900@xmath114  pulse profile simplified suggests that these current distributions can become more complex or simplify as a consequence of the flare .",
    "this observation in combination with the sustained phase - averaged flux following both flares supports the assertion made from flare energetics ( e.g.  hurley et al .",
    "2005 ) that the ultimate energy source for these flares is likely internal to the star as opposed to relaxation of external currents .",
    "the spin frequency evolution of sgr  1806@xmath020  leading up to and following the giant flare was significantly different than the spin behavior seen in sgr  1900@xmath114  at the time of its flare .",
    "there was good circumstantial evidence to suggest that sgr  1900@xmath114  underwent a sudden change in frequency of @xmath21 at the time of the 1998 august 27 giant flare ( woods et al.2001 ) .",
    "extrapolation of the pre - flare and post - flare spin ephemerides showed a clear mismatch in frequency at the time of the flare ( woods et al .",
    "1999 ) and the pulse phase during the flare did not agree with a backward extrapolation of the post - flare pulse ephemeris ( palmer 2002 ) . however , this conclusion was not definitive due to uncertainty in the pre - flare pulse frequency of sgr  1900@xmath114  and energy dependence of the pulse profile during the flare . assuming the frequency change was genuine , thompson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) hypothesized that the drop in spin frequency of at the time of the giant flare could have been caused by a particle outflow during the flare .",
    "in fact , the transient radio nebula detected in sgr  1900@xmath114  ( frail , kulkarni & bloom 1999 ) supports the assertion of a particle outflow . assuming the outflow",
    "is restricted to a fraction @xmath22 of the surface , and accounting for the dependence of the outflows angular momentum on the latitude @xmath23 , we find      where @xmath25 is the total kinetic energy of the particles blown off the surface during the flare , @xmath26 is the time scale of the outflow , @xmath27 is the surface field strength , and @xmath28 is the velocity of the outflowing particles .",
    "thompson et al .  approximated the particle outflow parameters and assumed isotropic emission to match the inferred frequency change .",
    "the sgr  1806@xmath020  flare was @xmath42 orders of magnitude more luminous in @xmath29-ray / x - ray emission ( palmer et al .",
    "2005 ) and radio emission ( gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ) . moreover , extensive observations of the radio nebula provided measurements of the ejected mass ( @xmath30 g [ gelfand et al .  2005 ] ) , the total particle energy ( @xmath25 @xmath31 3 @xmath12 @xmath32 ergs [ gelfand et al .",
    "2005 ] ) , and the initial outflow velocity ( @xmath33 [ taylor et al .  2005 ] ) . for",
    "a surface dipole magnetic field strength of @xmath410@xmath11 g inferred from the pulse timing parameters , the expected @xmath34 for sgr  1806@xmath020  was      an ejection of this much mass from the surface of the star without producing a change in @xmath36 would require that the particle outflow proceeded rapidly ( @xmath41 s ) and/or the mass was expelled along the spin axis of the star .",
    "the non - spherical outflow of the material ( taylor et al .",
    "2005 ; fender et al .",
    "2006 ; granot et al .  2006 ) suggests that one or both of these requirements were met .",
    "one of the most obvious differences between the effects of the giant flares of sgr  1806@xmath020  and sgr  1900@xmath114  on the persistent x - ray emission is the relative timing of the observed changes . in sgr  1900@xmath114 ,",
    "the giant flare preceded and almost certainly triggered a flux enhancement and pulse profile change .",
    "for sgr  1806@xmath020 , the spectrum , flux and pulse profile were already changing several months before the flare , although the most significant pulse morphology transition occurred during / after the flare . in sgr",
    "1900@xmath114 , there was no detected change in torque preceding the flare whereas sgr  1806@xmath020  showed dramatic changes months before the flare epoch .",
    "the one pre - flare phenomenon common to both sgrs was the onset of intense burst activity in the months preceding their respective flares .",
    "it appears that the presence of intense burst activity is a necessary , but not sufficient condition to predict giant flares .",
    "there are some counter - examples where intense burst activity did not result in a giant flare ( e.g.  sgr  1806@xmath020  in 1984 and 1996 ) , although there could be a burst - intensity threshold that must be met in order to trigger a flare .",
    "the burst rate from sgr  1806@xmath020  in the months preceding the giant flare was higher and more energy was released than in previously recorded outbursts . with only two well - studied examples ,",
    "it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on magnetar behavior that is predictive of a giant flare .",
    "however , since all persistent emission parameters behaved differently in the years leading up to the flares produced by these two sgrs , it appears that the burst activity is the most promising metric to use .",
