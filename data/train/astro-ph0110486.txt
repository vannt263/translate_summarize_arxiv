    "an important way to unveil the nature of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) progenitors is to investigate the properties of the ambient medium surrounding them .",
    "the most popular models for grb formation involve either the collapse of a single massive star or the coalescence of two compact objects such as two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; narayan et al . 1992",
    "; woosley 1993 ) these models could be constrained by knowing the grb environment .",
    "massive stars have very short lives , thus they will explode in star - forming regions , which are typically characterized by very dense environments . on the other hand , most merging neutron stars would be very old and would have typically traveled far from their birthplace . the scenario of compact merger progenitors could thus be suggested by medium to low density environments .",
    "recent observations ( see e.g. kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ) for the subclass of long bursts seem to suggest their association with star - forming regions .    within the context of grb progenitors involving the collapse of a massive star ,",
    "several proposals have been made : the so - called `` hypernova '' scenario ( paczyski 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1998 ) predicts a simultaneous explosion of the burst with a type ic supernova , while the `` supranova '' model by vietri & stella ( 1998 ) predicts a two - step explosion , in which the burst onset follows a supernova explosion by several months . while the rebrightening of the optical afterglows detected in several bursts @xmath0 days after the burst explosion ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ; reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "2000 ) is suggestive of the first scenario , the detection of iron emission and absorption features in the x - ray emission of the bursts and afterglows ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ; piro et al .",
    "2000 ) can be better explained with a two - step explosion ( lazzati et al .",
    ". independent tests of these different scenarios are therefore needed .",
    "a study of the density distribution in the close environment of the bursts can be a powerful diagnostic of the type of progenitors .",
    "in fact , if the burst explodes simultaneously with the supernova , the photons propagate through the pre - explosion stellar wind [ @xmath1 , while in the two - step scenario a high density metal enriched supernova remnant is expected to surround the burst explosion site ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "various methods have been proposed to investigate the properties of the grb environment .",
    "it has been shown that the effect of the surrounding material on the propagation of photons can be a probe of the material itself through the detection of absorption features and their time evolution ( perna & loeb 1998 ; meszaros & rees 1998 ; bttcher et al .",
    "1999 ; ghisellini et al . 1999 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2001abc ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2001a ) . in x - rays",
    ", it is particularly interesting the possibility to detect iron @xmath2 absorption edges ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1999 ; bttcher et al . 1999 ,",
    "weth et al .",
    "2000 ) and their time evolution ( lazzati et al . 2001c ; bttcher et al . 2001 ) . in the optical ,",
    "the evolution of the equivalent width of absorption features has been investigated by perna & loeb ( 1998 ) . on the other hand , modelling the afterglow spectral and intensity evolution in the framework of the external shock synchrotron model can also constrain the type of environment ( wijers & galama 1999 ; berger et al .",
    "2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 , ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2001b ) . in the first case",
    ", however , the search for the signatures of the material is made difficult by the low signal - to - noise ratio of the lines , while the second procedure heavily relies on a particular model , and hence depends on its assumptions .    in this paper , rather than considering the feature produced by a particular transition",
    ", we consider the continuum soft x - ray absorption caused by the photoionization of low - intermediate atomic number ( @xmath3 ) atoms along the line of sight to the burst ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) . this absorption is usually quantified by means of the quantity @xmath4 , the column density of neutral material with solar metallicity that would cause the observed absorption ( in the simulations we use abundances from anders & ebihara 1982 ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath4 is generally much easier to detect with respect to a fe @xmath2 absorption edge .",
    "in fact , the opacity of iron at @xmath5  kev is less than one hundredth of the opacity at 1  kev of a material with solar iron abundance ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the precise measurement of the absolute @xmath4 value can be model dependent .",
    "in fact , the @xmath4 measurement is performed by computing the difference of the observed soft x - ray flux with respect to an assumed model in the same band .",
    "a spectral break at @xmath6  kev may for this reason induce a high spurious @xmath4 measurement .    in the following sections we present the results of numerical simulations for the evolution of the measured @xmath4 as a function of the time elapsed after the onset of a source of ionizing photons in its centre .",
    "we consider in particular the possibility of detecting a variation of the column density during the @xmath7 seconds of duration of a typical grb . by imposing that the @xmath4 should remain above the detection threshold for a reasonable time ( 1 s ) but vary in less that the grb duration",
    ", we can strongly constrain the geometrical properties of the material surrounding the grb .",
    "we then compare our results with the @xmath4 measurements performed in the early emission of grb  980329 ( frontera et al . 2000 ) and grb  780506 ( connors & hueter 1998 ) .",
    "in the case of a single atomic transition it is possible to derive analytical equations to describe the time evolution of its opacity in the optically thin regime ( lazzati et al .",
    "2001c ) . in the case of continuum absorption",
    "the calculation is complicated by the need of keeping track of all the ionization states of the various elements and relative cross sections . for this reason the problem can be faced only with the use of numerical simulations .",
    "we have used the time - dependent photoionization code described in lazzati et al .",
    "( 2001c ) , which is based on routines developed by raymond ( 1979 ) and specialized to the case of grbs and their remnants by perna , raymond & loeb ( 2000 ) and perna & raymond ( 2000 ) . as described by perna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , this code computes in a fully time - dependent fashion the ionization state of the 12 most abundant astrophysical elements , while updating , at each time step , the temperature of the plasma .",
    "the ionizing continuum is simulated in the range [ 0.01 - 10 ]  kev with a spectrum relevant to grb emission .",
    "we adopted a photon index @xmath8 and constant luminosity @xmath9  erg  s@xmath10 in the [ 210 ] kev band for @xmath11 .",
    "we considered three different radial distributions of the density of absorbers : a uniform cloud with @xmath12  cm , a shell with @xmath12  cm and @xmath13 and a wind with @xmath14 for @xmath15  cm and @xmath16 for smaller radii .",
    "for the uniform and shell geometries , we performed simulations with initial column densities ranging from @xmath17  @xmath18 to @xmath19  @xmath18 , logarithmically spaced by a factor @xmath20 . in the case of the wind geometry , we considered only high values of the initial column density because of its very rapid decrease with time , and we performed simulations for the initial values @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xmath18 .    even though the simulations for the uniform and shell geometries are performed for a single value of the outer radius of the absorber distribution ( see above ) , these can be applied to rescaled matter distributions .",
    "in fact , given a distribution of absorbers @xmath24 and the ionizing luminosity @xmath25 , the results of the simulations can be extended to any distribution @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is a scale parameter ) and any luminosity @xmath28 .",
    "the time of photoionization of an ion is proportional to the flux , which scales as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the distance of the ion from the photon source and @xmath31 the luminosity of the ionizing photons .",
    "for this reason @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the column density as a function of time from the simulation and @xmath34 is the column density as a function of time for the ionizing luminosity @xmath28 and the distribution of absorbers @xmath26 .",
    "the above described numerical code produces frequency and time - dependent opacities @xmath35 by fully accounting for the spectral variation with time of the opacity as the gas makes the transition from neutral to fully ionized ; as such , however , the output of the code contains much more information than the observational data .",
    "this is particularly true for the grb prompt x - ray emission , usually detected with proportional counter detectors , such as the _ beppo_sax wide field cameras ( wfc ) .",
    "in particular , what is usually measured from the observed spectra is the amount of soft x - ray absorption , parameterized with the hydrogen column density in the assumption that all the material is cold , i.e. neutral ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "we hence applied an analogous procedure to our synthetic dataset , averaging the opacity in the observed band in order to reduce the information contained in the simulated spectrum to a column density to be compared with the observations .",
    "this is equivalent to assume that the time and frequency - dependent opacity can be decomposed as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the average cross section at frequency @xmath38 , independent of time , weighted with the abundance of each element .",
    "our procedure is also justified by the fact that the most widely used software for x - ray data analysis ( xspec ; arnaud 1996 ) neglects the change of @xmath37 with ionization to compute the column density ( model wabs ) when the single ion features can not be resolved elements ( see , e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "1994 for a more refined treatment of warm absorbers ) . in our case ,",
    "however , the situation is made more difficult by the fact that the absorber is not in the same ionization state at a given time @xmath39 .",
    "the inner regions will be completely ionized at a time in which the outer regions are still cold , while gas at intermediate distance is warm . ] .",
    "the consequence of this assumption is that the column density at a given time has a small dependence on the band in which it is measured . in the present paper",
    "we consider the energy range [ 210 ]  kev , since our aim is to compare our results with the measurements performed with the _",
    "beppo_sax wfc .    in the above approximation",
    ", we compute the column density as : @xmath40}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath41}$ ] represents the average over the frequency range [ 210 ]  kev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nht ] we show the results of a simulation for a uniform cloud with @xmath42  @xmath18 and @xmath12  cm .",
    "the opacities as a function of frequency are plotted for several times after the burst onset , while the inset shows the evolution of the column density in the first 100 s of the simulation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] we show the results of two simulations with identical initial conditions , but for different geometries of the absorbing material .",
    "the evolution of the absorbing column density in a uniform cloud and a shell are shown with a solid and a dashed line , respectively .",
    "the column density of a shell environment has a roughly linear decay , slower than that of the uniform cloud .",
    "this is due to the fact that in a shell geometry all the material is located at a large distance from the source of ionizing photons , and hence the ionization time is longer . with a good dataset",
    ", this difference can be succesfully used to investigate the radial structure of the absorbing medium .",
    "in several bursts , detection of variable low - energy x - ray absorption has been claimed ( grb  780506 , connors & hueter 1998 ; grb  980329 , frontera et al .",
    "2000 ; grb  990705 , amati et al .",
    "2000 ; grb  010222 , int zand et al . 2001 ) . in this section",
    "we examine under which conditions such an evolution of the measured column density can be detected during the prompt emission of the bursts .    in order to detect an @xmath4 variation it is sufficient ( but also necessary ) that the following two constraints be satisfied .",
    "first , the spectrum of the grb must be integrated in order to perform a measurement of column density .",
    "the minimum integration time ( see e.g. frontera et al .",
    "2000 ) is of the order of several seconds .",
    "variations of the column density can then be detected only if @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the measured @xmath4 one second after the burst onset , and @xmath45 is the galactic column density . with this condition",
    "we ensure that the column density in the surroundings of the grb gives a detectable signal in the first integration bin .    on the other hand , in order to detect a variation ,",
    "the column density must sensibly decrease during the grb emission time .",
    "our second condition is then that the observed column density decrease by a factor of two in less than 100 seconds , the average burst duration that we use in eq .",
    "[ eq : c2 ] has been chosen since a sizable decrease of the absorbing column is needed in order to have a significant measurement of its variation ( see below ) .",
    "we tested different values ( namely 1.1 and 10 ) finding that the allowed region changes slightly , but the conclusions are not significantly affected . ] : @xmath46 we must also consider that the burst itself has to be detected . since the soft @xmath47-rays , in which grbs are usually detected , are not attenuated by photoabsorption , we consider thomson scattering as the most effective attenuation process .",
    "we then have @xmath48  @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath49  @xmath18 , the [ 210 ] kev flux is completely absorbed and only a lower limit to the column density can be measured . in the extreme case of a large and dense cloud ( line - shaded region in fig  [ fig : uni ] , [ fig : she ] and [ fig : ger ] ) the opacity in the [ 210 ]  kev range is larger than unity for the whole duration of the bursts , and no flux can be detected in this band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : uni ] , [ fig : she ] and [ fig : wind ] we show that conditions ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) can be satisfied only in a limited range of cloud radii , geometries and initial column densities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uni ] we show the column density at time @xmath50  s and @xmath51  s as a function of the cloud radius and initial column density with solid and dashed contours , respectively .",
    "the shaded area underlines the region in which both conditions are satisfied .",
    "this shows that , in order to detect @xmath4 variations during the prompt emission of the burst , the absorbing region surrounding the grb must be compact , with a radius @xmath52  pc and initial column density @xmath53  @xmath18 .",
    "this translates to volume densities @xmath54  @xmath55 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : she ] shows the same results but for a shell with @xmath56 .",
    "the possible contribution of a wind environment to the column density evolution is considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind ] . in the figure we plot the measured @xmath4 as a function of time for three different initial column densities : from a thin @xmath21  @xmath18 wind to a maximum value of @xmath57  @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wind ] shows how , no matter the initial value of the column density , it drops to an undetectable level in less then a fraction of a second .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the case of a wind geometry , the column density is dominated by the region very close to @xmath58 , for which the ionization time is very short .    in order to compare the inferred cloud properties with the properties of galactic molecular clouds , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ger ] we compare the gray region in the parameter space with the properties of galactic molecular clouds and their denser regions .",
    "we assume that the burst explodes in the centre of these regions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ger ] , the circles show the properties of a sample of cloud radii and masses presented in leisawitz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , from which we derived average column densities .",
    "there are no circles that fall in the allowed region shaded in grey . inside molecular clouds , however , there are overdense regions , where star formation is supposed to take place .",
    "the triangles show the position in the diagram of a sample of dense molecular cloud cores , selected for their presence of h@xmath59o masers and in which massive star formation is taking place ( plume et al .",
    "their radii and column densities are consistent with the shaded region . in some cases",
    "the column density is even too high . a sample of bok globules ( launhardt et al . 1998 ) , thought to be directely related to star formation ,",
    "is shown with asterisks .",
    "their properties are fully consistent with the shaded region . finally , we plot with diamonds the properties of dense cores in the taurus molecular clouds , where low - mass star formation is though to happen ( zhou et al .",
    "these are too compact with respect to the shaded regions .",
    "it is however worth mentioning that the properties of these overdense regions at the time of the burst explosion may be somewhat different , due to the radiation pressure exerted by the luminosity of the massive star progenitor to the burst .",
    "should these @xmath4 variations be confirmed , they indicate that the burst progenitors ( or at least some of them ) are located inside overdense regions of molecular clouds .",
    "the properties of these regions are consistent with those of the places in which massive star formation takes place .      to date ,",
    "three grbs detected by the wfc on board _",

    "the timescale has been reported to the beginning of the flaring activity of the burst , which starts @xmath60  s after the trigger ( see fig . 1 of frontera et al .",
    "2000 )    we fitted our uniform - cloud and shell models for the evolution of the column density to the data . for the uniform model we obtained the best values @xmath61  @xmath18 and @xmath62  pc ( @xmath63  @xmath55 ) , while in the shell case we obtain @xmath61  @xmath18 and @xmath64  pc . in fig .",
    "[ fig:980 ] , the best fit models are shown with a solid line ( uniform ) and dashed line ( shell ) . the shell model has a better @xmath65 value , but due to the large uncertainties in the measurement , the two geometries can not be significantly disentangled .",
    "the upper right inset shows the @xmath66 , 90 per cent and 99 per cent confidence contours for the two parameters in both cases .",
    "since the statistical significance of the variation of the column density is not compelling , the 99 per cent confidence contour is not closed .",
    "the different evolution of the two models shows , however , that with good quality data it is in principle possible to understand what is the geometry of the medium surrounding grbs .    a problem in the fit of grb  980329 data is the lack of a redshift measurement of the burst .",
    "in fact all our simulations are performed in the rest frame .",
    "the model should be however modified in two ways if the source of absorption lies at redshift @xmath67 .",
    "first , the timescale is stretched by a factor @xmath68 .",
    "most importantly , if a column density @xmath69 surrounds a source at redshift @xmath70 , the soft x - ray absorption measurement will yield a measured value @xmath71 , where the exponent @xmath72 holds in the redshift range @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that for a source at redshift @xmath74 the measured column density is underestimated by a factor @xmath75 .",
    "the modelling of the data with a known redshift may hence give a best fit which is an even more compact and dense cloud .      besides the three bursts detected by the _",
    "beppo_sax wfc , a measurement of column density was possible in a burst serendipitously detected in 1987 by the heao-1 satellite with the a-4 and a-2 instruments ( grb  780506 , connors & hueter 1998 ) .",
    "the burst spectrum was fitted with a three component model : a power - law , a thermal component and an absorption component , with the column density free to vary .",
    "the lightcurve was integrated in time bins of 10.24 s each and the six spectra were fitted indipendently .",

    "[ fig:780 ] . in the first time bin",
    "a very significant ( @xmath76 ) soft x - ray absorption was detected , while the fits in the remaining 5 time intervals yielded only upper limits .",
    "fitting our uniform cloud model to the data , again without the possibility to correct for the redshift of the burster , we find a best fit cloud with @xmath77  cm and @xmath78  @xmath18 . since only one positive measurement was possible , as shown by the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:780 ] , the radius and initial column density of the cloud can not be precisely determined simultaneously .",
    "we can safely conclude , however , that the density of the cloud was @xmath79  @xmath55 .",
    "since for this burst only one positive measurement was obtained , it is not possible to distinguish between a uniform and a shell geometry .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to compute the evolution of the soft x - ray absorption of a cloud under the ionization flux of a gamma - ray burst exploded at its centre .",
    "we have considered a uniform cloud , a shell and a wind geometry , and we have shown that variations of the column density during the duration of a grb can be detected only under well - defined geometrical conditions of the absorbing material .",
    "the column density of a wind , in which the bulk of the material responsible for the absorption is close to the grb , can not survive the first milliseconds of the illumination and is undetectable with the present instrumentation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the material is spread uniformly over a region with size @xmath80  pc , the soft x - ray absorption can be observed to evolve in time .",
    "present data do not allow to firmly detect the evolution of the column density , nor to tell if the material is uniformly spread around the source or rather concentrated in a shell at distance @xmath81 from the burster . by comparing the allowed properties of molecular clouds with the results presented here , we conclude that the weak evidence of @xmath4 variation during the prompt x - ray emission of some grbs can be accounted for if they are associated to compact overdense regions similar to the cocoon of star formation within molecular clouds or to bok globules .",
    "a number of approximations have been applied to this analysis and are worth a discussion .",
    "first , we consider an ionizing flux with fixed spectrum and luminosity .",
    "both these assumptions are coarse approximations of a grb lightcurve and spectral evolution .",
    "even though grb are frantically variable , the results of our simulations are exact if the time @xmath39 is substituted with the quantity @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the total burst duration . since in this work the detailed time variability of the @xmath4 lightcurve is not addressed , the approximation of constant luminosity is reasonable .",
    "a more important issue is the variation of the spectral slope with time .",
    "more complete simulations of time - dependent column densities will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( perna et al . in preparation ) , in which the dependence of the observed column density on the ionizing spectrum will be discussed in detail .",
    "however , @xmath8 is a good value for the average time integrated low - energy slope of grbs ( preece et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we have assumed that the medium is at rest during the photoionization process . while lazzati et al .",
    "( 2001c ) showed that the fireball interaction is not important , radiation pressure may accelerate the medium .",
    "the ratio of the timescale of photoionization @xmath84 over the timescale of acceleration @xmath85 is given , for a @xmath8 spectrum , by : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the break energy of the grb spectrum and @xmath88 is the average photoionization cross section at the threshold energy @xmath89 weighted with the element solar abundance ( anders & ebihara 1982 ) . even for iron , the relevant element with the highest threshold energy ,",
    "the acceleration timescale is several orders of magnitude longer than the photoionization one .    finally , as discussed in  4.1 , the redshift of the burst introduces time dilation and decreases the observed column density at a given time .",
    "all these factors have not been taken into account in fig .",
    "[ fig : uni ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : she ] , so that the gray shaded regions should be considered indicative , with uncertainties up to a factor of order unity .",

    "[ fig : uni ] or inside a shell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : she ] ) .",

    "<S> we investigate through dedicated numerical simulations the evolution of the soft x - ray absorption properties of a cloud surrounding a gamma - ray burst source . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the absorption properties of the material are strongly modified by the ionization induced by the intense burst flux . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the temporal evolution of the measured column density as a function of the density and size of the absorbing medium . </S>",
    "<S> even if their statistical significance is not extremely compelling , we find that the detection in several bursts of variable absorption during the gamma - ray phase can be accounted for if these bursts are associated to overdense regions in molecular clouds with properties similar to those of star formation globules . </S>",
    "<S> we fit our model variable column density to the data of grb  980329 and grb  780506 , showing that with this method the size , density and density distribution of the material surrounding a burst can be measured .    </S>",
