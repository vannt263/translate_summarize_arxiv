    "while the majoranas can now be exchanged , non - abelian statistics is not obvious in this context .",

    "ultimately , this can be deduced by considering two vortices which bind majorana fermions @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "since the spinless fermion operators effectively change sign upon advancing the superconducting phase by @xmath82 , one introduces branch cuts emanating from the vortices ; crucially , a majorana fermion changes sign whenever crossing such a cut . upon exchanging the vortices ,",
    "@xmath81 ( say ) crosses the branch cut emanating from the other vortex , leading to the transformation rule @xmath83 and @xmath84 which is generated by the unitary operator @xmath85 . with many vortices , the analogous unitary operators @xmath86",

    "( [ hkitaev ] ) can be smoothly connected , let us consider the case where each wire in the t - junction is described by the latter .",
    "more importantly , we further deform kitaev s hamiltonian to be _ purely real _ as we exchange @xmath94 .",
    "the states @xmath24 and @xmath93 can then also be chosen real , leading to an enormous simplification : while these states still evolve nontrivially _ the berry phase accumulated during this evolution vanishes_.    for concreteness , we deform the hamiltonian such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the non - topological regions of fig .",

    "with this simple rule in mind , we see in fig .",
    "[ tjunction ] that although we can successfully swap the majoranas while keeping the hamiltonian real , we inevitably end up reversing the arrows along the topological region . in other words ,",
    "the sign of the pairing has flipped relative to our initial hamiltonian .    to complete the exchange",
    "then , we must perform a gauge transformation which restores the hamiltonian to its original form .",
    "this can be accomplished by multiplying all fermion creation operators by @xmath100 ; in particular , @xmath101 .",
    "it follows that @xmath83 and @xmath102 , which the unitary transformation @xmath85 generates as in the 2d @xmath0 case .",
    "we stress that this result applies also in the physically relevant case where gates transport the majoranas while the superconducting phases remain fixed ; we have merely used our freedom to deform the hamiltonian to expose the answer with minimal formalism . additionally , since figs .",
    "[ tjunction](e)-(h ) also represent a counterclockwise exchange , it is natural to expect the same result for this case .",
    "the supplementary material analyzes both types of exchanges from a complementary perspective ( and when the superconducting phases are held fixed ) , confirming their equivalence .",
    "there we also establish rigorously that in networks supporting arbitrarily many majoranas exchange is implemented by a set of unitary operators @xmath86 analogous to those in a 2d @xmath0 superconductor .",

    "second , while a specific overall phase has been calculated in eqs .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , this phase is certainly non - universal .",

    "for instance , had we rotated the superconducting phase from @xmath76 back to 0 before moving @xmath80 all the way to the right in fig .",
    "[ tjunction](d ) , a different overall phase would emerge .",
    "( as we found earlier , the average number of particles encoded in the wavefunctions when the rotation takes place affects the berry phase and would be different in this case . ) furthermore , as we demonstrate below the overall phases depend on the specific form of the hamiltonian even when the superconducting phases remain fixed ; see eqs .",
    "( [ 01b ] ) and ( [ 4majoranastates ] ) .",
    "this result is perhaps not too surprising  the overall phases follow from many - body wavefunctions that encode not only topological information , but also non - universal , high - energy physics .",
    "third , to obtain the result in eq .",
    "( [ u12 ] ) we chose in eq .",
    "( [ hlambda ] ) to rotate the superconducting phase counterclockwise from @xmath76 to 0 in the final step of the exchange . had we alternatively chosen to rotate the phase in a clockwise fashion , the ground state @xmath93 would pick up a relative phase of @xmath402 instead of @xmath403 under the exchange compared to @xmath24 .",
    "interesting physics underlies the ambiguity . to understand this",
    ", first note that the cases where one rotates the superconducting phase from @xmath76 to 0 counterclockwise versus clockwise differ by an overall rotation by @xmath82 . in any superconductor , rotation of the superconducting phase by @xmath82 effectively changes the sign of all fermion operators ; in particular , here such a @xmath82 rotation sends @xmath404 .",
    "remarkably , exchanging @xmath80 and @xmath81 twice ( with the same orientation ) while keeping the superconducting phases fixed also sends @xmath405 .",

    "<S> although braiding of majoranas alone does not permit universal quantum computation@xcite , implementation of the ideas introduced here would constitute a critical step towards this ultimate goal . </S>"
