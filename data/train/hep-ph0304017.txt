    "the investigation of long - lived heavy quarkonium @xmath0 composed of quarks with different flavors can produce a significant progress in the study of heavy quark dynamics , since the variation of bound state conditions for the heavy quarks in various systems such as the heavy - light hadrons or doubly heavy mesons and baryons provides us with the different conditions in both the binding of quarks by the strong interactions and the electroweak decays .",
    "in addition to the rich fields of study such as the spectroscopy , production mechanism and lifetime there is a possibility to get the model - independent information on the cp - violating parameters in the heavy quark sector in the unitary triangle derived from the charged current mixing in the heavy quark sector can be obtained from the decays of doubly heavy baryons , too , in the same manner @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite .    the first experimental observation of the @xmath0 meson by the cdf collaboration @xcite confirmed the theoretical predictions on its mass , production rate and lifetime @xcite .",
    "so , we could expect , that an essential increase of statistics in the nearest future will provide us with a new battle field in the study of long - lived doubly heavy hadrons at tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite .",
    "the special role of heavy quarks in qcd is caused by the small ratio of two physical scales : the heavy quark mass @xmath1 is much greater than the energetic scale of the quark confinement @xmath2",
    ". this fact opens a way to develop two powerful tools in the description of strong interactions with the heavy quarks .",
    "the first tool is the perturbative calculations of wilson coefficients determined by the hard corrections with the use of renormalization group improvements .",
    "the second instrument is the operator product expansion ( ope ) related with the small virtuality of heavy quark in the bound state , which reveals itself in many faces such as the general expansion of operators in inverse powers of heavy quark mass and the qcd sum rules .",
    "a specific form of ope is the application for the heavy quark lagrangian itself , which results in the effective theories of heavy quarks .",
    "the effective theory is constructed under the choice of its leading term appropriate for the system under study .",
    "so , the kinetic energy can be neglected in the heavy - light hadrons to the leading order .",
    "the corresponding effective theory is called hqet @xcite . in the doubly heavy mesons",
    "the kinetic energy is of the same order as the potential one , while the velocity of the heavy quark motion is small , and we deal with the nonrelativistic qcd @xcite and its developments by taking into account the static energy in the potential nrqcd in a general form ( pnrqcd ) @xcite or under the correlation of quarkonium size and the time for the formation of bound system with the improved scheme of expansion in the heavy quark velocity ( vnrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "the perturbative qcd remains actual in the effective theories , since it is necessary for the calculation of wilson coefficients determined by hard corrections . more definitely , the perturbative calculations determine both the matching of wilson coefficients in the effective theory with the full qcd and the anomalous dimensions resulting in the evolution of the coefficients with the variation of normalization point . in this respect",
    "we have to mention that the pnrqcd results on the static potential and the mass - dependent terms in the heavy quark - antiquark energy were confirmed by vnrqcd after appropriate limits and some calculational corrections in vnrqcd .",
    "in addition , the pnrqcd is a powerful tool in the studies of both the spectroscopy and the heavy quarkonium decays @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the wilson coefficients , the hadronic matrix elements of operators composed by the effective fields of nonrelativistic heavy quarks can not be evaluated in the perturbative manner . in this paper",
    "we use the potential model for such the calculations in the case of leptonic constant for the mixed - flavor heavy quarkonium @xmath0 .",
    "the matching procedure is performed with the two - loop accuracy available to the moment .",
    "in the nrqcd approximation for the heavy quarks , the calculation of leptonic constant for the heavy quarkonium with the two - loop accuracy requires the matching of nrqcd currents with the currents in full qcd , @xmath4 where we have introduced the following notations : @xmath5 are the relativistic quark fields , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the nonrelativistic spinors of anti - quark and quark , @xmath8 is the four - velocity of heavy quarkonium , so that @xmath9 where the scale @xmath10 gives the normalization point for the matching of nrqcd with full qcd , while @xmath11 denotes the normalization point for the calculations in the perturbation theory of nrqcd .    for the pseudoscalar heavy quarkonium composed of heavy quarks with the different flavors ,",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath12 is calculated with the two - loop accuracy @xmath13 and @xmath14 are explicitly given in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the anomalous dimension of factor @xmath15 in nrqcd is defined by @xmath16 } \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s^{\\overline{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle}ms}}(\\mu)}{4\\pi}\\right)^k , \\label{anom}\\ ] ] whereas the two - loop calculations representations : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a number of `` active '' light quark flavors . ] give @xmath21 } & = & 0,\\\\ \\gamma_{[2 ] } & = & -8 \\pi^2 c_f",
    "\\left[\\left(2-\\frac{(1-r)^2}{(1+r)^2}\\right ) c_f + c_a\\right ] , \\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the ratio of heavy quark masses .",
    "the initial condition for the evolution of factor @xmath23 is given by the matching of nrqcd current with full qcd at @xmath24 .",
    "the leptonic constant is defined in the following way : @xmath25 in full qcd the axial vector current of quarks has zero anomalous dimension , while in nrqcd the current @xmath26 has the nonzero anomalous dimension , so that in accordance with ( [ match])([g2 ] ) , we find @xmath27 where , in terms of nonrelativistic quarks , the leptonic constant for the heavy quarkonium is given by the well - known relation with the wave function at the origin @xmath28 , while the leptonic constant @xmath29 is evaluated at a fixed normalization point @xmath30 , which will be attributed below .",
    "it is evident that @xmath31 and the anomalous dimension of @xmath32 should compensate the anomalous dimension of factor @xmath33 , so that in two loops we have got @xmath34 } \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s^{\\overline{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle}ms}}(\\mu)}{4\\pi}\\right)^2 .",
    "\\label{anoma}\\ ] ] the physical meaning of @xmath35 is clearly determined by the relations of ( [ a ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) : this factor gives the normalization of matrix element for the current of nonrelativistic quarks expressed in terms of wave function for the two - particle quark state ( in the leading order of inverse heavy quark mass in nrqcd ) .",
    "certainly , in this approach the current of nonrelativistic quarks is factorized from the quark - gluon sea , which is a necessary attribute of hadronic state , so that , in general , this physical state can be only approximately represented as the two - quark bound state . in the consideration of leptonic constants in the framework of nrqcd , this approximation requires to introduce the normalization factor @xmath35 depending on the scale .",
    "the renormalization group equation of ( [ anoma ] ) is simply integrated out , so that @xmath36^{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\gamma_{[2]}}{2\\beta_1 } } , \\label{rg2}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "a constant of integration could be defined so that at a scale @xmath39 we would get @xmath40 .",
    "thus , in the framework of nrqcd we have got the parametric dependence of leptonic constant estimates on the scale @xmath39 , which has the following simple interpretation : the normalization of matrix element for the current of nonrelativistic quarks at @xmath39 is completely given by the wave function of two - quark bound state . at other",
    "@xmath41 we have to introduce the factor @xmath42 , so that the approximation of hadronic state by the two - quark wavefunction becomes inexact .",
    "following the method described in @xcite , we estimate the wave function of @xmath43 quarkonium in the nonrelativistic model with the static potential given by @xcite , so that @xmath44 in a wide region of distances between the quarks @xmath45 , the static potential of @xcite free of infrared singularity can be matched with the two - loop perturbative potential @xmath46 calculated in @xcite . in this way",
    "the difference between the potentials @xmath47 depends on the normalization point @xmath48 in the perturbative qcd of static sources .",
    "it can be numerically approximated by the expression @xmath49 reflecting the infrared uncertainties in the perturbative calculations .",
    "( 100,110 ) ( -5,5)=100 ( 90,0)@xmath11 , gev ( -20,102)@xmath50 , gev    the masses of heavy quarks used in the potential model of @xcite @xmath51 are consistent with the values of running masses as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the cancellation of renormalon in the sum of the perturbative static potential and pole masses of heavy quarks takes place , so that @xmath52 in what follows we put the normalization point of perturbative potential @xmath53 .",
    "the result of calculation for the leptonic constant of @xmath0 in the potential approach is shown in fig .",
    "we chose the values of @xmath10 in a range , so that the stable value of leptonic constant would be posed at the scale @xmath54 , which is the condition of consistency for the nrqcd approach",
    ". then one can observe the position of @xmath55 gev , where the estimate of @xmath50 is independent of the choice of @xmath10 and @xmath39 , and the maximal values at the different choices of @xmath10 are also close to each other .",
    "( 100,85 ) ( -5,5)=100 ( 83,1)@xmath10 , gev ( -2,77)@xmath50 , gev    we have found that in order to reach the minimal dependence of leptonic constant on the hard scale , the normalization point @xmath39 should correlate with @xmath10 at fixed @xmath11 .",
    "for illustration we show the result at @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fb_chard ] .",
    "( 115,95 ) ( -5,8)=120 ( 97,20)@xmath11 , gev ( 5,13)@xmath10 , gev ( -5,87)@xmath50 , gev    the full dependence on the scales is presented in fig .",
    "[ fb_c3d ] .",
    "we can see that there is a saddle stable point for the leptonic constant depending on two scales : the normalization point of perturbative calculation for the wilson coefficient in nrqcd and the matching point of nrqcd with the full qcd .",
    "this stability implies that in the vicinity of saddle point the contribution of higher corrections in @xmath58 is not significant , while at other values of scales these corrections should be taken into account .",
    "the final result of two - loop calculations is @xmath59 it should be compared with the estimate of potential model itself without the matching @xmath60 which indicates the magnitude of the correction about 20% .",
    "furthermore , the calculations in the same potential model with the one - loop matching @xcite gave @xmath61 where the uncertainty is significantly greater than in the two - loop procedure , since at the one - loop level we have no stable point in the scale dependence of the result .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the discussion given in @xcite we see that the correction is not crucially large , but it is under control in the system of @xmath0 .",
    "the reason for such the claim on the reliability of result is caused by two circumstances .",
    "first , the one - loop anomalous dimension of nrqcd current is equal to zero .",
    "therefore , we start the summation of large logs in the framework of renormalization group ( rg ) with the expressions in ( [ anoma ] ) and ( [ rg2 ] ) .",
    "second , after such the summation of large logs the three - loop corrections could be considered as small beyond the leading rg logs .",
    "the result on @xmath50 is in agreement with the scaling relation derived from the quasi - local qcd sum rules @xcite , which use the regularity in the heavy quarkonium mass spectra , i.e. the fact that the splitting between the quarkonium levels after the averaging over the spins of heavy quarks weakly depends on the quark flavors .",
    "so , the scaling law for the s - wave quarkonia has the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial quantum number , @xmath64 are the masses of heavy quarks composing the quarkonium , @xmath65 is the reduced mass of quarks , and @xmath66 is a dimensional constant independent of both the quark flavors and the level number @xmath63 .",
    "the value of @xmath66 is determined by the splitting between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 levels , or the average kinetic energy of heavy quarks , which is independent of the quark flavors and @xmath63 with the accuracy accepted .",
    "the accuracy depends on the heavy quark masses , and it is discussed in @xcite in detail .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 can be extracted from the known leptonic constants of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , so that the scaling relation gives @xmath71 for the vector state .",
    "the difference between the leptonic constants for the pseudoscalar and vector @xmath68-states is caused by the spin - dependent corrections , which are small .",
    "numerically , we get @xmath72 , hence , the estimates obtained from the potential model and the scaling relation is in a good agreement with each other .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the leptonic constant for the ground state of @xmath43 system in the framework of the qcd - motivated potential model used for the estimate of nonperturbative hadronic matrix element for the effective fields of nonrelativistic quarks .",
    "the wilson coefficient calculated with the two - loop accuracy @xcite has been implemented to relate the currents of heavy quarks in the full qcd and nrqcd .",
    "it depends on two scales : the matching point and the normalization scale in nrqcd .",
    "the stable point in the scale parameter space has been observed , which makes the estimate to be reliable .",
    "we have found that the two - loop corrections are under control in the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath50 is in agreement with the estimates obtained in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite , potential models @xcite and from the scaling relation @xcite .",
    "the expected systematic error coming from the usage of potential model is reduced due to the qcd motivation consistent with the measurements of qcd coupling constant at large virtualities , the asymptotic freedom up to three loops and the fitting the mass spectra of charmonia and bottominia , so that the systematic accuracy is of the same order as the uncertainty related with the variation of parametric scales shown in ( [ fin ] ) .",
    "the author thanks a.onishchenko for a possibility to get fresh results on the two - loop wilson coefficient in the language of mathematica package and for valuable remarks .",
