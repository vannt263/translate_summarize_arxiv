    "with the advent of the lhc , the electroweak scale is being probed at last .",
    "however , the startlingly good agreement of the standard model ( sm ) with precision flavor and electroweak measurements begs the question : does tev - scale physics substantially modify the sm story of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) ?",
    "hints from low - energy data suggest that physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) , if it has to do with flavor , ewsb , or leptons , may be heavy , while new physics at the tev scale may more comfortably be hadrophilic , and not obviously related to the mysteries of ewsb .",
    "such a situation poses theoretical puzzles .",
    "however , the possibility is one which should be seriously considered : nature has a track record of handing us particles for which we have no obvious need .",
    "there are many open possibilities for interesting bsm physics at the tev scale , many of which present large signals for the early lhc .",
    "one such possibility is a new non - abelian gauge interaction @xmath0 which confines at scales @xmath1 tev . to access this sector",
    ", some new particles must couple to both the @xmath0 sector and the sm ; the simplest possibility is a fermion species @xmath2 which transforms under both @xmath0 and the sm gauge groups . if @xmath2 is in a vector representation ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same quantum numbers ) of the sm gauge group and does not have large mixings with sm fermions , sm precision observables are unaffected . for @xmath2 charged under qcd , after the group @xmath0 confines , the spectrum of @xmath0-hadrons will include several new colored states  @xcite .",
    "this simple scenario naturally gives rise to signals which are particularly well - suited to study at the lhc : new colored states with masses at the tev scale or below .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 sector will typically contain a relatively light color - octet vector meson @xmath5 with @xmath6 tev , and colored pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb s ) @xmath7 with masses @xmath8 parametrically lighter than @xmath9 .",
    "these states are particularly important for the lhc phenomenology of a new confining interaction , as the @xmath5 can be resonantly produced through its mixing with the gluon , while the @xmath0-pions @xmath7 , as the lightest colored particles in the @xmath0 sector , have the largest production cross sections .. one can introduce a peccei - quinn symmetry to forbid the bare fermion masses  @xcite .",
    "the opposite situation , @xmath10 , leads to quirks , with very different phenomenologies  @xcite . ]",
    "while the production cross sections for these light composite states are large , the dominant decays of the @xmath7 and the @xmath11 yield all - hadronic final states , and large qcd backgrounds can make discovery challenging @xcite .",
    "this is especially true of the vector resonance , @xmath5 , which naturally has large branching fractions to other new states , rather than back to dijets , thus leading to multijet final states which can be challenging to separate from qcd backgrounds .",
    "recent advances in jet substructure have extended lhc sensitivity to both sm @xcite and bsm @xcite signals in otherwise challenging multi - jet final states . here , we will demonstrate the power of simple jet substructure techniques to improve lhc discovery sensitivity to colored resonances .",
    "the hierarchy of mass scales @xmath12 means that the @xmath0-pions produced in the decay of a @xmath13 are boosted .",
    "the subsequent decay @xmath14 can be extracted from the large qcd background using a simple and flexible @xmath0-pion tagger , which distinguishes the perturbative @xmath0-pion decay from the shower structure of a qcd jet .",
    "our main motivation is a confining gauge group , as this scenario naturally generates the hierarchy of mass scales which necessitates a substructure analysis , but the techniques presented here are useful for any theory with a colored vector resonance ( `` coloron '' @xcite ) or colored axial vector resonance ( `` axigluon '' @xcite ) with new colored daughters .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce a simplified model capturing the dynamics of interest and discuss the parameter space of the theory . in section  [ sec : discovery ]",
    "we introduce two simple jet substructure searches and show the discovery reach of the 7 tev lhc for both .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions , and in appendix  [ sec : vectorconfinement ] we provide a more extended discussion of how our simplified model fits into the lagrangian of a generic confining sector .",
    "one generic possibility for physics above the electroweak scale is a new gauge interaction @xmath15 which confines at a scale @xmath9 above the electroweak scale",
    ". new fermion species @xmath2 which transform under @xmath0 then are not observed in isolation at colliders , but rather in bound states which are singlets of @xmath0 , which we call @xmath0-hadrons .",
    "this idea is hardly new : technicolor is one example of such a model . unlike technicolor",
    ", however , we do not necessarily imagine here that the chiral condensation of @xmath15-fermions is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in general the new confining gauge group will result in a rich spectrum of @xmath0-hadrons with a range of sm quantum numbers . in the spirit of simplified models  @xcite",
    ", we introduce a simplified model which succinctly captures the most relevant dynamics for discovery at hadron colliders , especially in dijet or multi - jet final states .",
    "a discussion of how this simplified model maps onto such well - motivated extensions of the standard model as a new confining interaction is provided in appendix  [ sec : vectorconfinement ] .",
    "the most relevant degrees of freedom for hadron colliders are first , the lightest colored particles , which will enjoy the largest production cross sections , and second , vector octets , which can be resonantly produced through mixing with the gluon . matter which is charged under both qcd and the new confining group @xmath0 will typically lead to a multiplet of colored pngb s which will be among the lightest @xmath0-hadrons .",
    "we will study here a pseudo - scalar octet of @xmath0-pions , @xmath16 , which we will take to be electroweak singlets .",
    "pseudo - scalar octets will always have a minimal pair - production cross - section at hadron colliders through their qcd interactions .",
    "however , if a heavier spin - one @xmath0-hadron like a @xmath0-vector meson @xmath5 is also present , the @xmath16 pair - production cross section can easily be enhanced by the potentially large resonant production of the @xmath5 together with a large coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce here a phenomenological lagrangian capturing the dynamics of the pseudo - scalars @xmath16 together with an octet vector @xmath13 .",
    "we will work with the effective lagrangian @xmath17 together with two dimension - five operators allowing the @xmath7 to decay , which will be discussed later .",
    "this lagrangian consists of mass and kinetic terms for the @xmath13 and @xmath16 , kinetic mixing between the @xmath5 and qcd gluons @xmath18 , and a @xmath13-@xmath16-@xmath16 vertex analogous to the familiar @xmath19-@xmath20-@xmath21 vertex in qcd . here",

    "the coupling @xmath30 governs the resonant @xmath13 production cross section , while @xmath27 controls the relative branching fraction of the @xmath24 into @xmath0-pions or back into @xmath32 .",
    "although @xmath27 and @xmath30 are independent parameters , for simplicity we take them to be related according to [ eq : grhovstanth ] g_= .",
    "this choice of relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath30 is convenient for comparison to a weakly coupled renormalizable coloron model  @xcite , which realizes similar phenomenology . for strong interaction models",
    ", one can estimate @xmath33 , which corresponds to a small value of @xmath34 .",

    "( [ eq : grhovstanth ] ) yields a smaller value for @xmath35 mixing than would be obtained from scaling the observed @xmath36 mixing in qcd @xcite .",
    "the only importance of this for our present purposes is in reducing the resonant @xmath24 cross - section relative to the qcd - like expectation , and our analysis is in this sense conservative . ]",
    "once we have chosen a relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath27 , the production times branching ratio @xmath37 is fixed for a given @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "results for other choices of @xmath27 at a given @xmath30 can be obtained by scaling the branching ratio as desired , provided the total @xmath24 width remains narrow .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath12 is important for determining the model s signatures at the lhc .",
    "previous lhc studies @xcite have focused on the region of parameter space where the _ a priori _ unknown ratio @xmath12 is chosen by scaling from qcd , yielding  @xcite = 3 ( ) , where the observed electromagnetic contribution to the pion mass splitting is @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this model for the unknown @xmath0 dynamics yields @xmath41 .",
    "however , this scaling relies critically on specific features of the qcd spectral functions , whose genericity is unclear . on general grounds , and avoiding the usual qcd - like @xmath42 scaling , we may expect the @xmath0-pion mass to scale like m^2__g",
    "~ _ g^2 , where @xmath9 is the scale where the @xmath0 interactions become strong . for @xmath24 with mass of order the cutoff",
    ", we can estimate ~0.1 .",
    "our main interest will be to establish the discovery reach in the region of parameter space where @xmath8 is sufficiently small compared to @xmath43 that a flexible treatment of jets allows for better separation of signal from background . as we will see in section  [ sec : discovery ] , our range of interest is therefore from @xmath44 up to the qcd - like value @xmath45 , while for larger mass ratios traditional multi - jet searches become more efficient .",
    "gauge invariance allows for additional renormalizable interactions beyond those in the simplified model of eq .   which we will neglect , and which are further discussed in the appendix  [ sec : vectorconfinement ] .",
    "note that the leading interactions of the new colored degrees of freedom with the sm proceed only through qcd gauge interactions .",
    "this ensures agreement with precision electroweak and flavor constraints .",
    "the renormalizable interactions of eq .   have a @xmath46 symmetry @xmath47 and do not yet allow the @xmath7 to decay . at dimension five ,",

    "the operator @xmath54 is analogous to the operator mediating @xmath55 in the sm , and is naturally generated in many theories through triangular anomaly diagrams , as we discuss further in the appendix  [ sec : vectorconfinement ] .",

    "the kinematics of the boosted @xmath7 allow for easier separation of signal from background than do the non - boosted @xmath88 coming from nonresonant qcd pair production .",
    "simple jet substructure analyses then suffice to give excellent discovery reach over much of the simplified model parameter space .",
    "the main task is to distinguish a collimated perturbative two - body decay @xmath89 from a qcd jet .",
    "when the pions are sufficiently boosted that both their daughter jets have a moderate probability to be contained in a standard ( @xmath90 anti-@xmath91  @xcite ) jet , the jet mass alone can provide significant improvements over a standard dijet search , as we will discuss below .",
    "for slightly less boosted @xmath0-pions , a more involved analysis improves the prospects .",
    "we employ a fat jet analysis based on the mass drop procedure pioneered by @xcite .",
    "specifically , we cluster the events on a large angular scale ( @xmath92 ) using the cambridge / aachen ( @xmath93 ) algorithm and require two fat jets with @xmath94 .",

    "if both conditions are satisfied , one identifies @xmath95 as the fat jet and @xmath102 as the subjets and exits the loop . otherwise , one replaces @xmath95 by @xmath103 and repeats the previous procedure .",
    "in addition to vetoing qcd , the mass drop analysis  @xcite helps clean up the jets and improves mass resolution .    another observable which can distinguish a perturbative decay from a qcd branching",
    "is the jet shape _ @xmath104-subjettiness _",
    "@xcite . given a jet found with initial radius @xmath105 and a set of @xmath104 subjet centers @xmath106 found ( with some algorithm ) inside the jet ,",

    "jets with smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath110 have radiation more ( less ) concentrated around the subjet axes , and are therefore more ( less ) amenable to a description in terms of @xmath104 subjets .",

    "results for @xmath126 anti-@xmath91 jets indicate that while overall agreement is good , pythia tends to underpredict qcd jet masses by 15 - 20% in the mass range @xmath127  @xcite .",
