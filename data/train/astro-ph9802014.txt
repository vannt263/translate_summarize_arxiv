    "the jodrell - bank vla astrometric survey ( jvas ) is a survey of flat - spectrum radio sources one of whose purposes is to search for gravitational lens systems .",
    "jvas contains the @xmath02400 strongest flat spectrum sources in the northern sky ( patnaik et al .",
    "1992a ; patnaik 1993a ; browne et al .",
    "1998 , wilkinson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "all sources were observed with the vla at 8.4  ghz giving a resolution of 200  mas .",
    "those that were found to possess multiple components or very complex structure have been followed - up either with the vla or with merlin and the vlba to give high resolution images ( king et al . , 1998 ) . by this process the lens systems b0218 + 257 ( patnaik et al .",
    "1993b ) , b1422 + 231 ( patnaik et al .",
    "1992b ) and b1938 + 666 ( king et al .",
    "1997 ) were discovered .",
    "also in the survey is the known system mg0414 + 0534 ( hewitt et al .",
    "1989 ; hewitt et al . 1992 ) and the probable lens b2114 + 022 ( augusto et al . 1998 ) . the advantage of jvas compared to the mit - green bank ( mg ) lens survey ( bennett et al .",
    "1986 ) is that by observing only flat spectrum , hence core - dominated , sources , it is relatively straightforward to recognize lens systems , even those which consist of just two images .",
    "we report here the discovery of such a double system , b1030 + 074 .",
    "we present vla , merlin and vlba radio images and evn information , together with hst wfpc2 results at 555  nm and 814  nm . in section 2",
    "we present the radio data and the optical data obtained for b1030 + 074 .",
    "a discussion of b1030 + 074 as a lens system follows in section 3 .",
    "in this section we present all the radio maps and information obtained since the discovery of b1030 + 074 . in table 1 we present the radio data . columns 1 - 4 show the telescope used for various observations , the date , the frequency and the resolution , respectively . the flux density in mjy of the a and b components as well as",
    "the flux density ratio a / b are shown in columns 5 - 7 . in table 2",
    "we present the optical data .",
    "columns 1 - 4 correspond to the same information as in table 1 while in columns 5 - 7 we quote the johnson v and cousins i system magnitudes for the two components and their flux density ratio respectively .",
    "all the data were analysed using a combination of the nrao aips software package and the caltech difmap software package ( pearson et al . 1994 ; shepherd 1997 ) .",
    "the discovery map of b1030 + 074 , made from vla a - configuration 8.4 ghz data giving 0.2 arcsec resolution , is shown in fig .",
    "1 . it shows two distinct compact components with a separation of 1.56 arcsec , with the fainter image , b , at a pa of 142@xmath1 relative to image a. the flux ratio at 8.4 ghz is 12.6 .",
    "vla data for b1030 + 074 were also obtained at two more epochs , in 1994 february 22 at 8.4 , 15 and 22 ghz , and 1995 december 20 and 19 at 15 and 22 ghz respectively . though both components are detected ,",
    "each is unresolved in the maps .",
    "the 15 and 22 ghz maps from 1995 december 20 and 19 are shown in fig .",
    "the integrated flux densities were determined using the tasks imean or jmfit / imfit within aips and are also shown in table 1 .",
    "merlin data were obtained at 1.7 and 5 ghz in 1993 september 27 and 1996 december 27 respectively with resolutions of 150 milliarcsec and 50 milliarcsec respectively .",
    "the two components of the lens system are again unresolved and a model fit to the data yields a flux ratio of 18.8 at the 1.7 ghz and 12.0 at the 5 ghz data . the merlin 5 ghz map is shown in fig . 1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "tom muxlow for reducing the 1.7 ghz merlin map of b1030 + 074 and dr .",
    "sunita nair for constructive comments on the paper .",
    "this research used observations with the hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by associated universities for research in astronomy inc . under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "the very large array is operated by associated universities for research in astronomy inc . on behalf of the national science foundation .",
    "merlin is operated as a national facility by nral , university of manchester , on behalf of the uk particle physics & astronomy research council .",
