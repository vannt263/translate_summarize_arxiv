    "in 1947 , goos and hnchen @xcite experimentally demonstrated that a totally reflected light beam at a plane dielectric interface is laterally displaced in the incidence plane from the position predicted by geometrical reflection .",
    "artmann @xcite in the next year advanced a formula for this displacement on the basis of a stationary - phase argument .",
    "this phenomenon is now referred to as goos - hnchen ( gh ) effect . in 1955 ,",
    "fedorov @xcite expected a transverse displacement of a totally reflected beam from the fact that an elliptical polarization of the incident beam entails a non - vanishing transverse energy flux inside the evanescent wave .",
    "imbert @xcite calculated this displacement using an energy flux argument developed by renard @xcite for the gh effect and experimentally measured it .",
    "this phenomenon is usually called imbert - fedorov ( if ) effect .",
    "the investigation of the gh effect has been extended to the cases of partial reflection and transmission in transmitting configurations @xcite and to other areas of physics , such as acoustics @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , and quantum mechanics @xcite . and",
    "the if effect has been connected with the angular momentum conservation and the hall effect of light @xcite .",
    "but the comment of beauregard and imbert @xcite is still valid up to now that there are , strictly speaking , no completely rigorous calculations of the gh or if displacement .",
    "though the argument of stationary phase was used to explain @xcite the gh displacement and to calculate the if displacement @xcite , it was on the basis of the formal properties of the poynting vector inside the evanescent wave @xcite that the quantization characteristics were acquired for both the gh and if displacements in total reflection .",
    "on the other hand , it has been found that the gh displacement in transmitting configurations has nothing to do with the evanescent wave @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to advance a unified theory for the gh and if effects through representing the vector angular spectrum of a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) light beam in terms of a 2-form angular spectrum , consisting of its 2 orthogonal polarizations . from this theory , the quantization characteristics of the gh and if displacements are obtained , and the artmann formula @xcite for the gh displacement is derived .",
    "the amplitude of the 2-form angular spectrum describes the polarization state of a beam in such a way that the eigenstates of the gh displacement are the 2 orthogonal linear polarizations and the eigenstates of the if displacement are the 2 orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "consider a monochromatic 3d light beam in a homogenous and isotropic medium of refractive index @xmath0 that intersects the plane @xmath1 . in order to have a beam representation that can describe the propagation parallel to the @xmath2-axis , the vector electric field of the beam",
    "is expressed in terms of its vector angular spectrum as follows @xcite , @xmath3 where time dependence @xmath4 is assumed and suppressed , @xmath5 is the vector amplitude of the angular spectrum , @xmath6 is the wave vector satisfying @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the vacuum wavelength , superscript @xmath10 means transpose , and the beam is supposed to be well collimated so that its angular distribution function is sharply peaked around the principal axis @xmath11 and that the integration limits have been extended to @xmath12 for both variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite . when this beam intersects the plane @xmath1 , the electric field distribution on this plane is thus @xmath15 hereafter the integration limits will be omitted as such .",
    "the position coordinates of the centroid of the beam ( [ field - distribution ] ) on the plane @xmath1 are defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 means partial derivative with respect to @xmath13 with @xmath14 fixed , @xmath19 means partial derivative with respect to @xmath14 with @xmath13 fixed , and superscript @xmath20 stands for transpose conjugate .",
    "since the fresnel formula for the amplitude reflection coefficient at a dielectric interface depends on whether the incident plane wave is in @xmath21 or @xmath22 polarization , it is profitable to represent the vector amplitude of the angular spectrum in terms of its @xmath21 and @xmath22 polarized components . to this end , let us first consider one plane - wave element of the angular spectrum whose wave vector is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is its incidence angle .",
    "its vector amplitude is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the complex amplitudes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , @xmath30 is the unit vector of @xmath28 and is perpendicular to the plane @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the unit vector of @xmath29 and is parallel to the plane @xmath31 .",
    "this means that @xmath33 can be represented as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is what we introduce in this paper and is referred to as the 2-form amplitude of the angular spectrum , @xmath36 represents the normalized state of s polarization , and @xmath37 represents the normalized state of p polarization . @xmath38 and @xmath39 form the orthogonal complete set of linear polarizations .     schematic diagram for the rotation of the vector amplitude @xmath40 of an arbitrarily polarized light beam . ]    after this element is rotated by angle @xmath41 around the @xmath2-axis as is displayed in fig .",
    "[ angular spectrum description ] , its wave vector becomes @xmath42 and its vector amplitude becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rotation matrix , @xmath45 is the unit vector of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the unit vector of @xmath48 .",
    "this shows that the vector amplitude ( [ vector form of angular spectrum ] ) can be represented as @xmath49 where matrix @xmath50 represents the projection of 2-form amplitude @xmath51 onto vector amplitude @xmath40 and is thus referred to as projection matrix , and @xmath52    now we have successfully represented , through the projection matrix , the vector amplitude @xmath40 in terms of the 2-form amplitude @xmath51 , that is to say , in terms of the 2 orthogonal linear polarizations @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it should be pointed out that in this representation , @xmath55 is not necessarily perpendicular to the plane @xmath31 , and @xmath56 is not necessarily parallel to this plane . denoting @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the unit vectors in @xmath62 and @xmath63 directions , respectively , and @xmath64 is the unit vector in the radial direction , we find that @xmath55 is in fact the unit vector in the azimuthal direction , @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , letting @xmath66 , it is apparent that @xmath67 . in other words",
    ", @xmath68 is in the radial direction .",
    "the directions of @xmath55 and @xmath68 are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ polarization in wavevector space ] .     and",
    "@xmath68 are in the azimuthal and radial directions , respectively . ]",
    "unit vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the wave vector @xmath69 are orthogonal to each other and thus satisfy the following relations , @xmath70 the first 3 equations guarantee @xmath71 from expression ( [ angular spectrum in 2-form ] ) for the vector amplitude and with the help of eq .

    ", we obtain @xmath72 eqs .",
    "( [ y - expectation ] ) , ( [ z - expectation ] ) , ( [ inner product of angular spectrum ] ) , ( [ key expression1 ] ) , and ( [ key expression2 ] ) are the central results of this paper , from which the gh and if displacements are derived below .",
    "without loss of generality , we consider an arbitrarily polarized _ incident _ beam of the following 2-form amplitude , @xmath73 where @xmath74 describes the polarization state of the beam and is assumed to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath75 angular distribution function @xmath76 is assumed to be a positively - definite sharply - peaked symmetric function around the principal axis @xmath77 and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath78 and @xmath79 stands for the incidence angle of the beam .",
    "( [ normalization1 ] ) and ( [ normalization2 ] ) guarantee the following normalization condition for the 2-form amplitude ( [ incident 2-form amplitude ] ) , @xmath80 one example of such a distribution function that satisfies normalization condition ( [ normalization2 ] ) is the following gaussian function @xcite , @xmath81      \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{w^2_z}{2 } k^2_z \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 is half the width of the beam at waist .",
    "@xmath85 is half the divergence angle of the beam .    according to eq .",
    "( [ angular spectrum in 2-form ] ) , the vector amplitude of the incident beam is given by @xmath86 .",
    "for a uniformly polarized beam that was obtained from a linearly polarized beam in experiments @xcite , the @xmath21 components of all its plane - wave elements are in the same direction , and the same to the @xmath22 components .",
    "but in our representation advanced here , the @xmath21 polarizations of different plane - wave elements are generally in different directions ; so are the @xmath22 polarizations . considering eqs .",
    "( [ angular spectrum in 2-form ] ) , ( [ incident 2-form amplitude ] ) and ( [ gaussian distribution ] ) together , one concludes that in order to describe a uniformly polarized beam mentioned above , it is essential that the incidence angle @xmath79 be much larger than @xmath87 .",
    "so we will only consider the case of large @xmath79 below .",
    "fortunately , this is just what we have in the case of total reflection",

    ", we have @xcite @xmath141 at large incidence angle , @xmath142 .",
    "the non - vanishing transverse displacement of the incident beam from the plane @xmath143 is in fact an evidence of the so - called translational inertial spin effect of light that was once discussed by beauregard @xcite .",
    "beauregard found that although the transverse wave vector of a 2-dimensional beam is identically zero , the 2 circular polarizations have non - vanishing transverse poynting vector , and called this phenomenon the translational inertial spin effect .",
    "the problem is that the electromagnetic field of so defined 2-dimensional beam is uniform in transverse direction , @xmath144 . in order to observe this effect ,",
    "it is necessary to have a bound beam that is not transversely uniform , provided that the expectation of transverse wave vector is zero .",
