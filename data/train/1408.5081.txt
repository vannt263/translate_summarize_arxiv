    "flexoelectricity , the linear coupling between electric polarization @xmath4 and inhomogeneous deformation , is always allowed by symmetry in all insulators since strain gradients break inversion symmetry .",
    "this effect , found 50 years ago  @xcite , has traditionally received little attention owing to its relatively weak effect in macroscopic samples . at the nanoscale ,",
    "however , strain gradients are typically much larger than at macroscopic scales , as reduced dimensions imply larger gradients .",
    "the impressive progress in the design and control of nanoscale structures has motivated a revival interest in flexoelectricity , which has become an attractive topic in material science in the past few years  @xcite . in the context of perovskite thin films , recent experimental breakthroughs  @xcite have revealed that the effect of strain gradients can be enormous in thin films , large enough to rotate or even switch ferroelectric domains .",
    "for instance , a recent experimental work  @xcite , which in part motivated ours , shows that an inhomogeneous deformation caused by pressing the tip of an atomic force microscope over the surface of batio@xmath0 films is able to switch the electric @xmath4 .",
    "to model in a more realistic manner the flexoelectric switching in ultrathin ferroelectrics , it is important to include the domain morphology , which is expected to depend strongly on the mechanical and electrical boundary conditions  @xcite . in the absence of electrodes or other sources of free charges that compensate the depolarizing field ,",
    "it is well known that ferroelectrics respond by forming periodic arrays of @xmath3 domains , whose character might be described using the traditional models of kittel ( open @xmath4 flow ) or landau - lifshitz ( closed @xmath4 flow ) . for instance , ordered @xmath3 stripe domains of the kittel type have been observed in pbtio@xmath0 ( pto ) films as thin as 3 unit cells deposited on srtio@xmath0 substrates , using x - ray photoelectron diffraction  @xcite .    from the theoretical side , to understand and predict properties of nanoscale films at the atomistic level , there have been numerous studies using @xmath5 methods as well as simpler models constructed from them , such as model hamiltonians and atomistic core - shell models . in particular , in pto ultrathin films the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive distortions in the ( 001 ) surface have been described  @xcite , indicating also a decrease of tetragonality with stabilization of in - plane @xmath4 and antiferrodistortive reconstruction in the region near the surface .",
    "studies of domain morphology reported vortex - like structures in films of a few unit cells thick  @xcite .",
    "the changes in @xmath4 and lattice deformation across the @xmath2 and @xmath3 domain walls ( dws ) hace also been investigated , with calculations performed in the material bulk  @xcite and in films of 3-unit - cell thickness  @xcite . however , none of these works describe the local properties of pto ultrathin films and their correlation with the domain morphology as the thickness varies . concerning this kind of simulations treating flexoelectricity , we can cite recent simulations involving a modified model hamiltonian technique for ( ba@xmath6sr@xmath7)tio@xmath0  @xcite which has been used to calculate flexoelectric coefficients as a function of the film thickness and temperature , but without making any reference to the domain presence .    then , although the flexoelectricity effect on nanoscale is attracting much attention , its exact role in the poling process of ultrathin films with a nanodomain configuration has not been completely characterized from the atomistic level . in this work ,",
    "we address some particular questions , such as how does a local strain gradient affect the domain pattern in free - standing ultrathin films ? and how does this depend on the film thickness and the strain gradient strength ? to answer these , using a first - principles - based atomistic model we study the flexoelectric switching in ultrathin films of the stereotypical ferroelectric pto , when a longitudinal strain gradient is applied locally over the center of one domain .",
    "our simulations indicate that for the explored films , thinner than 10  nm , the domain patterns in the unstrained films are thickness dependent and responsible for the film being locally deformed . in agreement with this ,",
    "the film response to a local and longitudinal strain gradient varies according to the nature of the domain pattern and as a function of the gradient intensity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the computational details for modelling the film and the conditions for mimicking a strain gradient .",
    "section iii presents the results in two parts .",
    "first , the local properties of strain - free films are reported for two thicknesses in order to understand later the gradient - induced changes .",
    "second , the domain pattern evolution for each of these films is investigated as the strain gradient strength is enhanced .",
    "finally , the paper concludes with a summary in sec.iv .",
    "prototype ferroelectric pto is modeled using an atomistic core - shell model fitted completely to first - principles calculations ( i.e. , no explicit experimental data were used as input ) as described in detail in ref .  .",
    "the model contains fourth - order core - shell couplings , long - range coulombic interactions , and short - range interactions .",
    "it has shown to correctly reproduce the cubic - tetragonal phase transition in bulk  @xcite and also was able to describe the surface properties and interface effects of ultrathin films  @xcite .    here",
    "we study free - standing ultrathin films of pto under ideal open - circuit electric boundary conditions performing classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations using the dl@xmath8poly package  @xcite at a constant temperature of 50  k , where pto presents a tetragonal ferroelectric phase .",
    "our films have two pbo - terminated surfaces and are modeled using supercells of @xmath9 unit cells .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied along the in - plane pseudocubic [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions ( axes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) but not along the [ 001 ] one ( axis @xmath12 ) defined as the growth direction . the long - ranged electrostatic energy and forces",
    "are calculated by a direct sum method  @xcite which is a computationally efficient alternative to the ewald summation . in the @xmath13 plane ,",

    "the film thicknesses range from 4.0  nm ( 10@xmath17 ) to 9.2  nm ( 23@xmath17 ) , where @xmath17 is the lattice parameter in the growth direction .",
    "atoms are free to relax along all directions , except when mentioned , as long as they remain inside the simulation box .",
    "local polarization is defined here as the dipole moment per unit volume of a perovskite unit cell centered on the ti ion and delimited by the eight pb nearest neighbors at the corners of the box .",
    "we consider contributions from all atoms in the conventional cell and atomic positions with respect to that center : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume of the cell , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the charge and the position of the @xmath22 particle , respectively , and @xmath23 is a weight factor equal to the number of cells to which the particle belongs .",

    "[ fig : kittel ] .",
    "the simulation supercell , indicated by dashed lines , holds only two domains .",
    "based on previous results  @xcite and also ours  @xcite , which indicate that the 180@xmath1 dws centered at the pb - o lattice planes are more stable than those at the ti - o@xmath30 ones , we use the former in our starting configuration .",
    "note that letting the structure relax will allow this domain configuration to change and the optimized one will depend on the film thickness as described below .",
    "_ strain gradient description . _",
    "as we are interested in the effect of switching the out - of - plane polarization , we apply strain gradients in the direction normal to the surface , that is , a gradient of the out - of - plane strain component @xmath31 along the [ 001 ] direction denoted as @xmath32 .",
    "we impose a linear gradient localized on an in - plane square region of @xmath33 unit cells that penetrates until the central plane , which compresses the upper plane by a given strain @xmath34 and then decreases linearly in the intermediate planes until vanishing at the central cells .",
    "one advantage of using the present atomistic model to treat flexoelectric effects  @xcite is that the interatomic potential does not need to be modified ; it is sufficient to place the system under appropriate mechanical - boundary conditions that mimic the required gradient . to do that",
    ", one first has to establish the strain gradient in the film , noting that its presence implies a stress gradient which produces net forces acting on the atoms inside each unit cell . during md simulations",
    ", the atoms will try to relax in order to vanish these net forces .",
    "thus , in order to preserve the gradient a force pattern must be applied to the atoms in the unit cell ; i.e. , certain atoms must be fixed along the full simulation . specifically , to set up the gradient , we start from the relaxed free film ( which already presents a domain structure ) and displace rigidly the atomic planes of the chosen unit cells until the average distance between consecutive pb - o lattice planes equals the required local strains @xmath35 in order to have @xmath32 .",
    "we choose to freeze out the @xmath12 components of the pb - core positions , allowing all other internal degrees of freedom ( the pb shell and other atoms , cores plus shells ) to relax along all directions .",
    "other choices are possible , for instance , the force pattern could be distributed between all atoms in the unit cell in different proportions  @xcite .",
    "finally , note that the local strain gradient induces an internal electric field which can compensate the depolarization field allowing that part of the free - standing film is poled .",
    "we focus first on strain - free films under ideal open circuit boundary conditions and revisit their local features . to begin with , the optimum lateral size of the simulation supercell ( i.e. , the number of cells @xmath36 ) is determined . for each considered thickness",
    ", we build up supercells of different lateral sizes , relax their structures , compare their total energies , and choose the lowest - energy one .",
    "the optimized structures are described below ; here we just present the optimum width @xmath37 of one domain period as a function of the film thickness @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kittel ] displays the linear relation between @xmath37 and the root square of @xmath26 , showing the fulfillment of the kittel law .",
    "we found that the optimum lateral sizes of the supercells are 26@xmath16 , 30@xmath16 , 34@xmath16 , and 36@xmath16 for thickness of 10@xmath17 , 16@xmath17 , 20@xmath17 , and 23@xmath17 , respectively .",
    "hereafter we present results only for films of two thicknesses  4.0  nm and 9.2  nm  because of their representative domain structures .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol_free ] shows a side view of cell - by - cell polarization map for the two thicknesses , where colors indicate the @xmath12-component values in the left panels and the @xmath38 cell tetragonality in the right ones .",
    "starting with the left panels , the 10@xmath17 ultrathin film ( top panel ) shows a flux - closure arrangement around central cores or _",
    "vortices_. this vortex state , where the local @xmath4 orientation rotates continuously around one geometrical core , can also be described as a 90@xmath1-domain loop .",
    "indeed , we can demarcate upward and downward @xmath4 domains ( hereafter up and down , respectively ) with a rhombus shape surrounded by triangular caps ( where @xmath4 is almost parallel to the surface ) that complete an overall closed loop .",
    "our simulations show that this domain morphology holds for thicker films until thicknesses of @xmath39  20 unit cells . above that critical value ,",
    "the central vortices enlarge in the normal direction , giving rise to 180@xmath1 dws that grow together with the film thickness .",
    "consequently , the shape of the up and down domains changes to hexagonal and a domain structure as envisioned by landau - lifshitz is formed , as shown in the bottom panels for a 23@xmath17-thickness film . in this structure ,",
    "in particular , we see that the 180@xmath1 dws end up in _ vertices _ or confluences of three dws as predicted by srolovitz and scott  @xcite and recently confirmed with high - resolution transmission electron microscopy images of pb(zr@xmath7ti@xmath6)o@xmath0  @xcite .    as regards the thicknesses of the dws , they vary depending on the type and location inside the film , the difference being more evident in the thicker films . in the inner region ,",
    "the orientation of the @xmath4 changes abruptly from up to down over a distance of two lattice constants , creating very narrow 180@xmath1 dws , in agreement with previous theoretical results for defect - free walls  @xcite .",
    "the 90@xmath1 dws instead differ according to their position with respect to the out - of - plane @xmath4 orientation , as indicated schematically in the bottom - right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_free ] for the up domain as an example , but the same behavior is repeated in the down domain . in the top part , the @xmath4 rotates 90@xmath1 in only three unit cells , leading to narrow 90@xmath1 dws . in the bottom part , instead",
    ", the @xmath4 rotates more continuously , requiring a few unit cells to change from the in - plane @xmath4 at the surface until pointing perpendicular , making these 90@xmath1 dws much broader .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the head - to - head  @xcite in - plane @xmath4s that confront each other at the junction of two triangular domains .",
    "the cell - by - cell tetragonal @xmath38 ratio is indicated by colors in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_free ] , where @xmath17 and @xmath16 were obtained by taking the distances between pairs of nearest - neighbor pb atoms along @xmath12 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the cells inside the triangular domains with @xmath4 parallel to the surfaces are almost cubic , whereas those at the cores of the domains with @xmath4 perpendicular are tetragonal and their values are thickness dependent .",
    "further , and in agreement with the high strain-@xmath4 interaction in pto , these tetragonality maps demonstrate the difference between the 90@xmath1 dws .",
    "the narrow upper ones are well defined , presenting an abrupt change in the @xmath38 ratio as the tetragonal axis rotates from perpendicular to parallel to the surface ; however , the broader ones at the bottom are characterized by a large tetragonality ( reaching , for instance , @xmath398% in the 23@xmath17 film ) which attenuates gradually in a few unit cells towards both sides . concerning the 180@xmath1 dws in the thicker films , the tetragonality does not change notably ,",
    "rather the wall is defined by an abrupt relative displacement or _ offset _ of the pb atoms along @xmath12 . finally , we emphasize the significant lattice deformation observed at the surfaces ( shown by different colors in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pol_free ] ) as well as across the film thickness specially in the 90@xmath1 dws .     and @xmath17 and modulus of the polarization @xmath12-component across the thickness for the 10@xmath17 and 23@xmath17 films .",
    "local parameters are averaged at the central cells of each domain up [ filled ( blue ) diamonds ] and down [ filled ( red ) triangles]and over the complete @xmath13 planes [ open ( green ) circles].,width=283 ]    to obtain further insights , we monitor those properties in detail through the film thickness .",
    "figure  [ fig : latt_free ] shows the in - plane @xmath16 and out - of - plane @xmath17 lattice parameters across the thickness for both films . averaging these values over complete planes parallel to the surface [ open ( green ) circles ] , we find that the average local @xmath16 s remain constant across the film due to the mechanical boundary conditions imposed on the simulation supercell .",
    "the average @xmath17 values show the typical symmetric profile determined by the two free surfaces : they are compressed at both surfaces and gradually increase towards the inner film , consistent with previous results  @xcite .",
    "however , examining closely at the central region of each domain , the local @xmath17 s present an asymmetric distribution : they are highly compressed in the two unit cells of the top surface ( with respect to the @xmath4 orientation ) and slightly enlarged at the bottom ones .",
    "the strain change along [ 001 ] is compensated in the plane only by the local lattice parameters @xmath16 , which behave oppositely to @xmath17 , but not by the @xmath40 parameters , which remain almost constants ( not shown here ) , corroborating that the unit cells at the surface neighborhood are highly distorted .",
    "this particular asymmetry through the thickness was also predicted in superlattices of pto / srtio@xmath0 from first - principles calculations  @xcite and even in the limit case of pto films of 1@xmath17 thickness whose unit cell is distorted  @xcite .",
    "thus , this information together with the above @xmath38 description shows that the free surfaces induce spontaneous strain gradients that break the inversion symmetry in the film , in agreement with previous works  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , knowledge of the local strain maps is essential to predict and understand the effect of an imposed strain gradient .",
    "+ moving to the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : latt_free ] , the profiles of the local @xmath41 modulus show that the averaged values per lattice plane are symmetric .",
    "remarkably , inside each domain , opposite to the highly asymmetric profiles of local @xmath17 , the @xmath41 profiles are almost symmetric ( in thinner films , actually they are slightly enhanced towards the top part ) .",
    "then we note that the modulus of @xmath4 and not @xmath41 follows the @xmath17 behavior across the film .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to end up this section , we analyze the local distribution of the antiferrodistortive distortion which has been shown  @xcite to coexist with the polar distortion at the surface , eventhough it essentially vanishes in bulk .",
    "it involves the oxygen octahedron rotation around the central ti ion , where the rotation axis is the @xmath12 axis ( @xmath42 ) with out - of - phase movements between neighbor cells on the ( 001 ) plane but successive in - phase movements along the [ 001 ] .",
    "its strength is described by the rotation angle of tio@xmath44 in the normal layer at each unit cell .",
    "table  [ table : afd ] lists the @xmath42 rotation angle dependence of the atomic layers starting at the top surface , for the two films of interest and in different regions of the film by entering perpendicular to the surface : in the central cells of the up and down domain , and crossing the center of one triangular domain ( reaching the central vortex of the 90@xmath1 dw loop or the 180@xmath1 dws , depending on the film thickness ) .",
    "the last column reports the values averaged for each complete tio@xmath30 atomic layer parallel to the surface .",
    "moving along [ 001 ] in the center of one domain , it is found that the rotation angle of @xmath45 in the superficial cells decays towards the internal atomic layers : although it almost vanishes in the second layer , recovers in the third one , and then keeps decreasing slowly .",
    "it reaches the bulk value of @xmath39 1@xmath46 just at the eleventh layer of the 23@xmath17  film , while in the thinner film , the superficial effects predominate .",
    "furthermore , we note that cells in opposite surfaces differ in @xmath47 , which is also related to the different natures of the junction of the 90@xmath1 dws as explained before .",
    "on the other hand , when entering the film through the triangular domains , the @xmath42 distortions from the second layer towards the inner ones are a bit larger than those in the center of the up and down domains .",
    "specifically , in the 180@xmath1 dws the @xmath42 distortion is about @xmath48 ( the octahedra rotate to allow the abrupt @xmath4 change , in addition to the offset ) , versus the @xmath47 in the domain cores , where the cells are tetragonal with ferroelectric distortions mostly along @xmath12 .",
    "the averaged values show a behavior similar to that in the cores of the out - of - plane @xmath4 domain but with values @xmath39 1@xmath46 larger than in the inner cells due to the values in the dws .",
    "finally , note that our results for the first three atomic layers can be compared , and indeed fully agree with previous calculations reported using the present model  @xcite as well as first - principles methods  @xcite .",
    "although those calculations have provided evidence of @xmath42 variation in the near - surface region , they were performed using smaller supercells than here and without any reference to the effect of the domain pattern .",
    "hence , our inspection of the @xmath42 local distribution gives insights into the dependence of the domain morphology , especially in the dw neighborhood .",
    "now we investigate how the pto film responds to a compressive strain gradient applied locally as its intensity increases .",
    "we are particularly interested in following the evolution of the domain configuration until eventually the polarization switches in the strain - gradient zone . as the first step",
    ", we have to choose where to apply the strain gradient .",
    "based on the observed local strain distribution in the central region of each domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : latt_free ] ) , we suppose that a compressive strain gradient on the top surface of the film would only accentuate the already existent inhomogeneous compression in the up domain ; on the contrary , it would alter the almost - constant @xmath17 distribution in the down domain .",

    "[ fig:10c - grad](d , iii ) ] shows that most cells , including those in the gradient region , are poled upward .",
    "the asymmetric distribution indicates that the switching process has started in the vortices that were brought close to the gradient region and now have disappeared , while the other vortices remain on the right side .",
    "+ note that due to the supercell in - plane periodicity , it is equally likely that in ( ii ) the vortices had shifted in @xmath62 towards the gradient region and therefore the switching process would have started at the other side .",

    "specifically , the maxima ( minima ) of @xmath65 extend along @xmath11 , coinciding with the positions of the central cores of the up ( down ) domain , while @xmath65 vanishes when rotation around the perpendicular @xmath11 axis exists , certainly where the vortex centers sit .",
    "then as the strain - gradient intensity increases and following the @xmath4 distributions , the @xmath65 response also presents three behaviors separated by the gradient values @xmath77 and @xmath67 .",
    "+ ( i ) for @xmath54 , the sinusoidal shape remains almost unchanged .",
    "+ ( ii ) for @xmath55 , when @xmath56 , in agreement with the @xmath4 distribution , the @xmath65 surface shifts in @xmath57 as shows by its projection on a transverse cut that crosses the central gradient region [ see the central curve in fig .",

    "[ fig : h_3d](c ) has changed dramatically , indicating that the 90@xmath1-domain loop configuration has been modified .",
    "two global extrema are observed , one maximum and one minimum , revealing that the periodicity of the domain structure and thus the extended cores of the each domain have vanished . from the @xmath70 definition ,",
    "we interpret that the @xmath65 minimum represents the part of the down domain farthest away from the gradient region and therefore the less affected one , whereas the @xmath65 maximum is located in the region of the up domain farthest away from the distribution of @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig : h_3d](b ) shows that the @xmath65 profile in this particular direction has slightly gained height in the positive branch , versus an important reduction in the negative one , reflecting the size enhancement of the up domain at expenses of the down domain .",

    "[ fig : grad_proy](b ) ] the affected region is already poled upward and the asymmetric distribution shows that one of the 180@xmath1 dws is still immobile .",
    "remarkably , as the gradient is increased further , the switched zone moves forward , generating vortices at the bottom as it continues growing laterally .",
    "thus , unlike the dw movements observed in thinner films , we find that the @xmath3 dws never move forward to the gradient region .",
    "this fact can be attributed to the relatively high energy barrier for the coherent motion of one entire @xmath3 dw compared to the @xmath2 dw case.@xcite      in summary , we investigate from an atomistic point of view flexoelectricity - induced domain evolution . in free - standing pbtio@xmath0 ultrathin films with thickness - dependent domain patters ,",

    "we first review the properties of strain - free films and confirm that the inhomogeneity of polarization , strain ( strain gradient ) , and antiferrodistortive rotational angles appears not only among the surface cells but also in the neighborhood of the dws . for the explored thicknesses ( 10 to 23 unit cells ) ,",
    "we find flux - closure domain structures whose morphology is thickness dependent .",
    "a critical value of 20 unit cells is found : thinner films show structures with 90@xmath1 domain loops , whereas thicker ones develop , in addition , @xmath3 dws giving rise to structures of the landau - lifshitz type .",
    "when a compressive strain gradient normal to the surface acts locally at the top surface of the film , we find that it is able to reverse the normal polarization in down domains but not in up domains , which is understood based on the knowledge of the local strain distribution before imposition of the gradient .",
    "the evolution of the domain pattern as a function of the strain gradient strength depends , accordingly , on the film thickness . in thinner films , first one of the center of the @xmath2 dw loops moves towards the gradient region and",
    "then the affected region is gradually switched . in thicker films , instead , no @xmath3 dw movement",
    "is observed and the local polarizations in the gradient region are progressively reversed as the gradient strength is enhanced .",
    "this work contributes from an atomistic point of view to the understanding of the mechanical flexoelectricity in tuning domains in ultrathin films .",
    "two comments on the arbitrary size of the affected region : ( i ) that its deep depends on the film thickness indicates that , for the same compressive strain on the superficial unit cell , the gradient is weaker in thicker films ; ( ii ) that the lateral size is kept constant means that the affected region is farther away from the 180@xmath1 dw as the domain size increases together with the film thickness ."
