    "one of the main goals of the present and next generation ultra - pure liquid scintillator detectors , such as borexino  @xcite , sno+  @xcite and lena  @xcite , is the determination of the neutrino fluxes produced by the cno cycle in the sun .",
    "the evaluation of cno cycle efficiency is , in fact , connected with various important problems , like e.g. the determination of globular clusters age @xcite from which we extract a lower limit to the age of the universe .",
    "moreover , it can provide clues to solve the so - called  solar composition problem \" , i.e. the fact that standard solar models ( ssm ) implementing the latest photospheric heavy element abundances  @xcite are not able to reproduce the helioseismic results , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the present experimental efforts in this direction are devoted to the observation of neutrinos originating from the @xmath4 decay of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the so - called _ cno neutrinos _",
    ", that represent about @xmath5 of the total solar neutrino budget .",
    "their detection is , however , a difficult task .",
    "the cno neutrinos have continuous energy spectra with endpoints at about 1.5  mev and do not produce specific spectral features that permit to extract the signal unambiguously from the background in high purity liquid scintillators ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion ) .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a different source of neutrinos in the cno cycle that is generally neglected .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite that neutrinos can be also produced in the sun by electron capture reactions on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting fluxes , to which we refer as _ eccno neutrino _ fluxes , are extremely small , at the level of @xmath6 with respect to the  conventional \" cno neutrino fluxes . however , eccno neutrinos are monochromatic and have larger energies equal to @xmath7 .",
    "we suggest that these characteristics , together with the development of gigantic ( i.e. with masses @xmath8 or more ) ultra - pure liquid scintillator detectors , such as lena @xcite , could make their detection possible . clearly , the determination of this sub - dominant component of the solar neutrino flux is extremely difficult but could be rewarding in terms of physical implications .",
    "in fact , besides testing the efficiency of the cno cycle , eccno neutrinos could permit to determine the metallic content of the solar core and also probe the electron neutrino survival probability in an energy region that is otherwise inaccessible , with important implications for the final confirmation of the lma - msw flavour oscillation paradigm .",
    "is thus useful to investigate the potential of future gigantic liquid scintillator experiments for eccno neutrino detection . with this spirit , in sect .",
    "[ eccno ] we review and update the predictions of eccno neutrinos fluxes by @xcite in light of the recent ssm calculations and we calculate the event spectrum expected in liquid scintillator experiments . in sect .  [ background ] , we compare our results with the expected background rates . in sect .",
    "[ summary ] , we give our conclusions .    ._. the neutrino fluxes ( @xmath9 ) produced by @xmath4 decay and electron capture processes on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 nuclei in the sun . in the last line , we also give the predictions for the @xmath10 neutrino flux .",

    "in this work , we analyzed the potential of gigantic ultra - pure liquid scintillator detectors for the detection of eccno neutrinos .",
    "the obtained results are encouraging as indicated by the fact that the sensitivity parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) ) that give the statistical significance of a measure with an exposure of @xmath13 in pyhsalmi and snolab , are @xmath14 .",
    "few comments are necessary to further elaborate on our results : + _ i ) _ below @xmath15 , eccno neutrinos provide a contribution to the total signal that is comparable to the statistical fluctuations for a detector with an exposure @xmath16 or larger .",
    "this means that they can not be neglected in statistical analysis that aim at the reconstruction of the low energy upturn of the electron neutrino survival probability predicted by the lma - msw solution of the solar neutrino problem ; + _ ii ) _ according to our estimate , the detection of eccno neutrinos in the proposed 50  kton lena detector can not be excluded . in a recent study @xcite , it was shown that the external background in lena can be reduced to a negligible level in a fiducial mass of 19  kton , thus allowing to measure the @xmath10 solar neutrinos event spectrum down to @xmath17 and to explore the energy region where the contribution of eccno neutrinos is not negligible .",
    "our background estimates are derived along the same lines of @xcite and agree with this analysis . however , that it would advisable that the lena experimental collaboration investigates the actual possibility of observing eccno neutrinos with a complete detector simulation and optimized cuts .",
    "+ _ iii ) _ in order to go beyond detection and to use eccno neutrinos as a probe for the solar composition and/or to observe the low energy upturn of @xmath18 , an accuracy at the level of @xmath19 or better is required .",
    "indeed , the predictions for the eccno neutrino fluxes disagree by @xmath20 when different surface compositions are considered .",
    "incidentally , the electron neutrino survival probability at eccno neutrino energies is also @xmath20 larger than the high energy value .",
    "in an ideal detector , with the characteristic described in our analysis and placed so deep that the cosmogenic background is negligible , the @xmath21 accuracy goal corresponds to an exposure @xmath22 .",
    "+ _ iv ) _ finally , our results are based on a simplified description of the detector properties .",
    "being the signal extremely small , the results may critically depend on the assumed detector characteristics , e.g. the assumed purification levels ; the parametrization of the energy resolution function ; the description of the detector response ( i.e. the @xmath23 parameter ) .",
    "as an example , the parameter @xmath24 ( calculated for @xmath25 ) is reduced from @xmath26 to @xmath27 if the detector energy resolution at 1  mev is increased from @xmath28 to @xmath29 and from @xmath26 to @xmath30 if the parameter @xmath23 is increased from 0.89 to 0.95 .",
    "we look forward for a complete analysis by the experimental collaborations working in the field .     for a liquid scintillator detector located at pyhsalmi ( left ) and snolab ( right)._,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   for a liquid scintillator detector located at pyhsalmi ( left ) and snolab ( right)._,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    [ fig2 ]",
