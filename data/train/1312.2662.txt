    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are short / brief intense flashes of soft @xmath0-rays , which have fascinated astronomers and astrophysicists since their unexpected discovery in the 1960s @xcite . their physical origin has been debated for a long time mainly due to the lack of an exact position and a reliable estimate of the distance to us . in 1997 , quite a few grbs were accurately localized by the bepposax satellite , leading to the discovery of their x - ray , optical and radio counterparts , and their redshifts @xcite .",
    "the cosmological origin of grbs was thus directly confirmed . in the standard fireball model ,",
    "the fit of the optical / radio / x - ray afterglow emission plays a key role in constraining the physical parameters including the forward shock parameters , the density profile of the circum - burst medium , the initial lorentz factor , and sometimes even the structure , of the outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the launch of the fermi satellite in 2008 , more than 30 grbs have been detected above 100 mev by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the satellite @xcite , confirming the long - lived mev ",
    "gev emission ( i.e. , longer than the prompt soft ) of grbs first revealed by egret  @xcite .    one of the most surprising findings in the fermi - era may be that the long - lived mev - gev emission is likely dominated by the synchrotron radiation ( see fig.3 of @xcite for a pioneering prediction and see e.g. , @xcite for modeling the fermi - lat data in such a way ) rather than the widely believed inverse compton radiation of the forward shock electrons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review on various inverse compton processes ) .",
    "in contrast , the first clear evidence of an inverse compton component of a grb was found only recently  @xcite . within the synchrotron radiation model ,",
    "the long - lived mev - gev emission alone can impose tight constraint on some physical parameters .",
    "this is very important since for some bursts only the fermi gbm / lat - data are available .",
    "as demonstrated in this work , grb 130821a is such an example .",
    "this work is structured as the follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly introduce grb 130821a . in section 3",
    "we present our data analysis results of the fermi gbm and lat data . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implications of the data .",
    "at 16:10:28.011 ut ( @xmath1 ) on august 21 2013 , the fermi gamma - ray monitor triggered on grb  130821a  ( trigger 398794231 ; * ? ? ? * ) , which resulted in an autonomous repoint request ( arr ) and the lat slewed to the gbm position .",
    "the best lat on - ground location was reported to be r.a .",
    "@xmath2 , dec .",
    "@xmath3 ( j2000 ) with an error radius of 0@xmath41 ( 68% containment , statistical error only ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gbm light curve showed a multiple - peaked structure with a duration ( @xmath5 ) of about 84s ( 50 - 300 kev ) .",
    "the angle of the grb position was about 37@xmath6 from the lat boresight at @xmath1 and the arr brought the source within the lat field of view for the next 2400 seconds , so the lat observed the grb position with good sensitivity over the entire prompt phase .",
    "multi - peaked emission lasting roughly 40 seconds can be seen using the non - standard lat low energy ( lle ) photons , which are dominated by 30100  mev , with a significance of  13 @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "konus - wind also triggered on grb  130821a  @xcite .",
    "the konus - wind team reported that the 20  kev to 18  mev time - averaged spectrum from 0  s to 78.08  s after the konus - wind trigger time is best fitted by the band function with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10  kev ; emission was seen up to @xmath119  mev .",
    "the burst fluence is @xmath12  erg  @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "rhessi , integral spi - acs , and mars odyssey - hend also triggered on this grb  @xcite .",
    "upper limits in the optical and x - ray bands were drawn because no source was found  @xcite within the lat error circle reported in  @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the grb location is likely outside of this reported error circle and therefore such limits do not apply to grb  130821a .",
    "we extracted both lat and gbm data from the fermi science support center .",
    "joint spectral fits of both lat and gbm data were performed over the whole prompt phase and for the four time intervals listed in table  [ fitresult ] , using the software package rmfit ( version 4.32 ) . due to the small number of photons detected by the lat , we used c - statistic rather than chi - squared statistic to fit the data .",
    "time tagged event ( tte ) data from the nai detectors n6,n7 and bgo detector b1 were used to make spectral fits for gbm , and the lat data contains transient class photons from 100  mev to 300  gev within 10@xmath6 around the localization of ( 314@xmath427 , @xmath14 ) , while lle data were also included .",
    "all spectra are well fitted by the band function  @xcite , and we report the best fit model parameters in table  [ fitresult ] . we found that adding a blackbody component did not improve the fits .    to better understand how spectral parameters evolve with time , the best - fit values of spectral parameters derived from gbm data in different intervals are shown in fig .",
    "[ batchfit ] . from the figure",
    ", there is a trend that @xmath15 increases as the flux of the burst , while change in @xmath16 is marginal . the @xmath17 value gradually becomes smaller with time , which is consistent with a hard - to - soft pattern  @xcite .      the fermi science tools v9r31p1 package was used to analyze the data . to filter out the earth s limb emission , we excluded events with zenith angles greater than 100 degrees in our analysis .",
    "we also used _",
    "gtfindsrc _ to find the best - fit position of this burst . when doing this , `` p7source '' data in time interval from @xmath18  s to @xmath19  s of energies between 100  mev and 300  gev from a region of interest ( roi ) of a 10@xmath6-radius circular region centered on ra = 314@xmath41 , dec = @xmath2012@xmath40 ( j2000)@xcite were selected .",
    "the derived best location is ra = 314@xmath427 , dec = @xmath2011@xmath470 ( j2000 ) with an error radius of 0@xmath4085 .",
    "following  @xcite , we produced a _ test - statistic _ ( ts ) map ( here we choose 0@xmath405 grid ) and the maximum in the ts map is located at ra = 314@xmath424 , dec = @xmath2011@xmath468 ( j2000 ) with an error radius of 0@xmath41 , consistent with the result obtained by _",
    "gtfindsrc_. we found that our derived grb position is well consistent with the interplanetary network ( ipn ) annulus @xcite , suggesting this position is more accurate than the one reported in  @xcite . a count map , using the 100  mev to 20  gev `` p7transient '' data in the time interval from @xmath21  s to @xmath22  s , is shown in figure  [ lat_cmap ] .",
    "the map illustrates that the lat data that we see are indeed positionally consistent with the ipn annulus and that the lat photons are associated with grb  130821a .",
    "therefore , we will use ( 314@xmath427 , @xmath2011@xmath470 ) as the burst location in the following analysis .",
    "we performed unbinned maximum - likelihood analyses to construct a light curve of grb  130821a in the energy range in 100  mev to 100  gev during the time range of @xmath23 to @xmath24  s. events that are classified as p7source in a 10@xmath6-radius circular region centered on ra = 314@xmath427 , dec = @xmath2011@xmath470 ( j2000 ) were used . to subtract the background contribution",
    ", we add the `` galactic '' ( gal_2yearp7v6_v0 ) and the `` extragalactic '' ( iso_p7v6source ) diffuse components and all point sources within the roi into our model file ( generated using _",
    "_ make2fglxml _ _ ) .",
    "since photon number in these short timescales is small , only parameters of 2 point sources within 5@xmath6 from the roi center were allowed to vary , while parameters of other point sources were fixed .",
    "our result is shown in fig .",
    "[ likelc ] and table  [ likeresult ] .",
    "some features can be found in this light curve : ( i ) during the first 60 seconds of the prompt emission , the ts value is consistent with zero , indicating that no emission was detected , ( ii ) from 60  s to @xmath112500  s after the grb onset , the flux decays as a simple power law , as has been observed for most other fermi lat grbs , ( iii ) in the time interval 6200s8200s , the spectrum is softer than earlier ones , but they are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we fit the light curve with a simple power law for the time bins with ts@xmath259 , and found the slope of the best - fit line to be @xmath200.82@xmath260.11 , which is shown as the solid line in fig.[likelc ] .",
    "if the last flux point ( i.e. , 6200s8200s ) is not included , the decay index is @xmath27 , whicis is consistent with the above value .",
    "an interesting point we note from fig.[likelc ] is that there is no significant @xmath25100 mev emission up to @xmath11@xmath2860s . to verify this ,",
    "we calculate probabilities of each photon being associated to grb 130821a by using the fermi sciencetool _ gtsrcprob _ , assuming a photon index of @xmath292.1 , and plot the probabilities v.s .",
    "photons arrival times in fig.[prob ] .",
    "all those transient class events in a 30@xmath6-radius circular region centered on ( 314@xmath427 , @xmath14 ) were considered , but only events with a probability being associated to grb  130821a greater than 0.1 are plotted . only 2 photons with probabilities larger than 0.5 arrived in the first 60 seconds of the prompt emission , energies of both of which are less than 300  mev .",
    "the fact that there is no significant detection at @xmath25100  mev by the lat during the first 60s after the grb onset , during which most of the prompt mev emission was seen , and @xmath17 was the highest , suggests that ( i ) the @xmath25100  mev emission is not an extrapolation to the band function during the prompt phase , and ( ii ) the lat and the gbm emission evolve independently . in turn",
    ", grb  130821a may be the first - ever grb where most or all @xmath25100  mev emission is unrelated to the prompt emission .",
    "the @xmath25100  mev emission must have a different origin than the prompt emission .",
    "as shown in fig.[batchfit ] , most of the prompt emission concentrated in the first 40 seconds after the burst onset .",
    "however , one can see from figs .",
    "[ likelc ] and [ prob ] that very rare @xmath30  mev photons have been detected in such an interval ( see also table  [ tab : like_fit ] ) and the most energetic @xmath0-ray at an energy @xmath116  gev arrived at 219  s after the trigger .",
    "the fermi - lat data likely peaked at @xmath31s , thus lagging behind the soft @xmath32ray peak emission significantly .",
    "after the high energy peak emission , the count rate drops with time as @xmath33 .",
    "all these behaviors are consistent with the forward shock synchrotron radiation model .",
    "below we take such a model and show that some interesting results can be achieved .",
    "the rising behavior of the forward shock synchrotron radiation light - curve sheds valuable light on the density profile of the circum - burst medium ( see table 1 in * ? ? ? * for a summary ) . for grb 130821a ,",
    "the high energy emission occurred significantly after the strongest soft gamma - ray emission phase had ended , hence the grb outflow should be in the thin shell regime for which @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the time when reverse shock crosses the ejecta ) , as defined in @xcite . for @xmath36 and the number density of the medium @xmath37 ( @xmath38 for interstellar medium and @xmath39 for free stellar wind ) , we have the typical synchrotron radiation ( cooling ) frequency @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and the maximal specific flux @xmath42 . for typical forward shock parameters ,",
    "the observer s frequency @xmath43 mev is well above both , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are estimated with eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of yost et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for @xmath36",
    ", we have @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then it is straightforward to show that with typical parameters @xmath48 erg , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 for @xmath53 s. [ footnote-1 ] ] @xmath45 and @xmath44 and we have @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , where @xmath56 is the power - law index of shocked electrons , as suggested by the simultaneous fermi - lat spectrum .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the quick rise ( quicker than @xmath57 , see fig.[likelc ] ) of the high energy emission for @xmath58 s , the particle density of the circum - burst medium should be a constant",
    ". the stellar wind medium model might be able to marginally match the data if the typical synchrotron radiation frequency of the forward shock @xmath59 mev at @xmath60 s ( see table  1 of xue et al . 2009 ; for current discussion , one should replace @xmath61 therein by @xmath62 ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned in the footnote [ footnote-1 ] , in the standard fireball model , for reasonable parameters , @xmath44 is expected to be @xmath63 mev , so is @xmath45 . for @xmath64 , the forward shock synchrotron radiation at energies above 100 mev drops with time as @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in agreement with the detected decline , where @xmath68 is the power - law index of the shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the high energy emission is thus @xmath69 , consistent with the data , too ( see the right panel of fig.[likelc ] ) .    in the thin shell case",
    ", the afterglow peak time traces the deceleration of the forward shock and in turn can be used to constrain the initial lorentz factor of the grb outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath70^{1/8},\\ ] ] + where @xmath71 represents the proton mass , @xmath72 the speed of light , and @xmath73 the peak time of the @xmath25100  mev emission , respectively .",
    "we assume the ambient density @xmath74 . the isotropic energy of the outflow @xmath75 can be estimated based on the total energy of prompt gamma - ray emission @xmath76 assuming a certain radiation efficiency @xmath77 . for grb 130821a",
    ", the redshift is unknown and we take the typical redshift of current grbs , i.e. , @xmath78 . using the energy fluence given by the konus - wind , we have @xmath79  erg . we take @xmath80 in the calculation according to  @xcite . as a result , we get @xmath81 .",
    "the initial bulk lorentz factor can be estimated in an alternative way . in the forward shock synchrotron model",
    ", it is widely known that the maximal radiation frequency can be estimated as ( e.g. , cheng & wei 1996 ) @xmath82 therefore the fact that the highest energy lat photon at an energy of @xmath83  gev arrived 219  s after the grb trigger suggests an initial lorentz factor @xmath84 $ ] , where the temporal decay of the lorentz factor @xmath85 has been taken into account .",
    "interestingly , the result , i.e. , @xmath86 ) , is consistent with the independent constraint using the forward shock deceleration argument .    in view of these facts",
    ", we conclude that : ( i ) the high energy emission of grb 130821a may indeed have a forward shock synchrotron radiation origin ; ( ii ) the circum - burst medium likely has a constant density profile ; ( iii ) the outflow is jetted and ultra - relativistic with an initial lorentz factor of a few hundred .",
    "our results demonstrate that the long - lived mev - gev emission alone can impose tight constraints on some physical parameters .",
