    "climate archives from the north atlantic region show repeated shifts in glacial climate , the dansgaard - oeschger ( do ) events @xcite . during marine isotope stages 2 and 3 the intervals between the events exhibit a tendency to coincide approximately with multiples of 1470 years @xcite , as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the statistical significance of this pattern and the responsible mechanism , however , is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "several hypotheses were proposed to explain the timing of do events .",
    "one of these relates the events to two century - scale solar cycles with periods close to 1470/7 ( = 210 ) and 1470/17 ( @xmath087 ) years @xcite , the so - called de vries / suess @xcite and gleissberg @xcite cycles .",
    "support for a leading solar role comes from deep - sea sediments , which indicate that during the holocene century - scale solar variability was a main driver of multi - centennial scale climate changes in the north atlantic region @xcite .",
    "recently the phase relation between solar variability ( deduced from @xmath1be ) and 14 do events was analyzed @xcite .",
    "a relation far from fixed was found and was interpreted as being in contradiction to braun et al.s hypothesis @xcite . while in linear systems a constant phase relation between the forcing and the response is expected , such a relation does not necessarily exist in non - linear systems .",
    "but climate records and ocean - atmosphere models @xcite , which are not yet suitable for statistical analyses on do events because of their large computational cost , suggest that the events represent switches between two climate states , consequently implying an intrinsically non - linear dynamical scenario . thus , to interpret the reported lack of a fixed phase relation between",
    "the do events and solar proxies , it is crucial to analyze their phase relation in simple models .",
    "here we investigate this phase relationship in a very simple model of do events .",
    "a comprehensive description of this model has already been published before , including a detailed discussion of its geophysical motivation and its applicability , as well as a comparison with a much more detailed ocean - atmosphere model @xcite . in the simple model , which was derived from the dynamics of the events in that ocean - atmosphere model ,",
    "do events represent repeated switches between two possible states of operation of a bistable , excitable system with a threshold ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these states correspond to cold and warm periods of the north atlantic region during do cycles .",
    "the switches are assumed to occur each time the forcing function ( f ) , which mimics the solar role in driving do events , crosses the threshold ( t ) .",
    "transitions between the two states are accompanied by an overshooting of the threshold , after which the system relaxes back to its respective equilibrium following a millennial - scale relaxation .",
    "the rules for the transitions between both states are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "it is assumed that the threshold function @xmath2 is positive in the interstadial ( `` warm '' ) state and negative in the stadial ( `` cold '' ) state . a switch from the stadial state to the interstadial one",
    "is triggered when the forcing @xmath3 is smaller than the threshold function , i.e. when @xmath4 .",
    "the opposite switch occurs when @xmath5 . during the switches a discontinuity in the threshold function",
    "is assumed , i.e. t overshoots and takes a non - equilibrium value ( @xmath6 during the shift into the stadial state , @xmath7 during the opposite shift ) .",
    "afterwards , t approaches its new equilibrium value ( @xmath8 in the stadial state , @xmath9 in the interstadial state ) following a millennial scale relaxation process : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the relaxation time in the stadial state ( s=0 ) and in the interstadial state ( s=1 ) , respectively .",
    "both the overshooting relaxation assumption and the transition rules in our simple model are a first order approximation of the dynamics of do events in a coupled ocean - atmosphere model @xcite . in that model",
    "the events also represent threshold - like switches in a system with two possible states of operation ( corresponding to two fundamentally different modes of deep water formation in the north atlantic ) and with an overshooting in the stability of the system during these shifts @xcite .",
    "analogous to the simple model , switches from the stadial mode into the interstadial one are triggered by sufficiently large negative forcing anomalies ( i.e. by a reduction in the surface freshwater flux to the north atlantic that exceeds a certain threshold value ) , whereas the opposite shifts are triggered by sufficiently large positive forcing anomalies ( i.e. by an increase in the freshwater flux that exceeds a certain threshold value ) .",
    "it has further been demonstrated that the simple model is able to reproduce the timing of do events as simulated with the ocean - atmosphere model , as well as the occurrence of non - linear resonance phenomena such as stochastic resonance and ghost resonance , which were shown to be properties exhibited by that model @xcite .",
    "an obvious advantage of the conceptual model compared with the ocean - atmosphere model is its low computational cost , which allows for extensive statistical analyses on the timing of do events .",
    "all model - parameter values chosen here are the same as in two earlier publications ( a@xmath13 msv , a@xmath14 msv , b@xmath15 msv , b@xmath16 msv , @xmath17 years , @xmath18 years ; 1 msv = 1 milli - sverdrup = @xmath19 m@xmath20/s ) @xcite .    : `` warm '' state ) .",
    "a switch from the cold to the warm state is triggered when @xmath21 , which happens in this example at time @xmath22 . during the transition , interpreted as the start of a do event , @xmath2 overshoots and relaxes back towards its new equilibrium @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) following a millennial time scale .",
    "the events are terminated by a switch back to the cold state , which is triggered when @xmath25 ( at time @xmath26 in the figure ) .",
    "again , t overshoots and approaches its new equilibrium @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . ]",
    "to test the assumption of a fixed phase relationship between solar - forced do events and solar variability , we here drive our model by a simple input consisting of noise @xmath29 and of two sinusoidal cycles with equal amplitudes a : @xmath30 + \\cos[\\frac{2 \\pi t}{t_2 } ] ) +    \\sigma \\cdot n(t).}\\ ] ] @xmath31 is the standard deviation of the noise and @xmath32 the standard unit variance white noise , with a cutoff frequency of 1/50 years ( figure 3 ) .",
    "following @xcite the cutoff is used to account for the fact that the model shows an unrealistically large sensitivity to decadal - scale or faster forcing . in analogy to @xcite the periods of the two cycles are chosen to be @xmath33 = 1470/7 ( = 210 ) years and @xmath34 = 1470/17 ( @xmath086.5 ) years , i.e. close to the leading spectral components of the solar de vries and gleissberg cycles .    in the simulations shown in figure 4 we use three different signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) : a = 8 msv and @xmath31 = 5.5 msv ( @xmath35 ) , a = 5 msv and @xmath31 = 8 msv ( @xmath36 ) , a = 3 msv and @xmath31 = 9 msv ( @xmath37 ) . for all of these",
    ", the waiting time distribution of the simulated events is centered around a value of 1470 years , with several peaks of only decadal - scale width ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the relative position of these peaks is well understood in the context of the ghost resonance theory @xcite .",
    "the peaks result from constructive interference between the two sinusoidal forcing cycles which produces particularly large magnitude variations in the bi - sinusoidal forcing and  when noise is added  leads to favored transitions at the corresponding waiting times .",
    "depending on the relative amplitude values of the noise and the periodic forcing this synchronization is more or less efficient , as is seen for the different signal - to - noise ratios in figure 4 . even for the lowest ratio , however , the synchronization is still notable .",
    "the waiting time distributions shown in figure 4 are thus almost symmetrically centered around a preferred value of 1470 years because the sinusoidal cycles enter in phase every 1470 years , creating forcing peaks of particularly large magnitude .",
    "this 1470-year repeated coincidence of the bi - sinusoidal forcing , however , does not show up as a corresponding forcing frequency , since no sinusoidal cycle with that period is present .",
    "thus , when linear spectral analysis is performed on the forcing , only the two century - scale sinusoidal cycles are detected as outstanding components .",
    "msv ) and white noise ( @xmath38 msv ) .",
    "( a ) total forcing f ( grey ) and threshold function t ( black ) .",
    "( b ) forcing components ( grey ) ; from top to bottom : 210-year cycle , 86.5-year cycle , noise .",
    "dashed lines indicate the onset of the simulated do events . despite the tendency of the three events to recur approximately every 1470 years",
    ", only the first two events coincide with minima of the 210-year cycle .",
    "the third event , in contrast , occurs closely after a maximum of that cycle . ]        despite the robustness of the synchronization effect , none of the two sinusoidal cycles in our forcing shows a fixed phase relationship with _ all _ of the simulated do events , due to the presence of noise and the existence of a threshold . in our model , a fixed phase relation can only be present in the low noise limit ( i.e. either for @xmath39 [ with a supra - threshold bi - sinusoidal forcing ] or for the lowest noise level that still enables repeated threshold crossings [ with a sub - threshold bi - sinusoidal forcing ] , thus corresponding to do events with extremely long waiting times ) , compare third column in figure 4 . even for the largest of the three signal - to - noise ratios in our simulations , the events thus only show a tendency to cluster around a preferred phase of the two sinusoidal cycles .",
    "outliers , however , can still occur in almost opposite phase , at least once over a sufficiently large number of events in the simulation .",
    "for the highest signal - to - noise ratio , for example , there is still a probability of about 35 percent to find at least one out of 14 events in opposite phase ( i.e. outside of the interval @xmath40 $ ] ) . and for the other two signal - to - noise ratios , the corresponding probability is even much higher ( i.e. 92 percent and 99.5 percent , respectively ) .",
    "since a fixed phase relationship between the simulated events and the forcing cycles does not even exist in our very simple model system , it appears unrealistic to us to assume the existence of such a relationship in the climate system .",
    "thus , the reported lack of a fixed phase relationship between do events and solar variability ( deduced from @xmath1be ) would also be expected with the proposed ghost resonance solar forcing .",
    "we note that superimposed epoch analyses of 14 simulated events can produce forcing - response relations similar to the one reported by @xcite : the onset of the superimposed events ( at @xmath41 in the fourth column in figure 4 ) typically coincides with a minimum in the averaged bi - sinusoidal forcing which , however , is not more pronounced than other minima and is highly damped as compared with the unaveraged forcing .",
    "a considerable statistical spread exists in the magnitude of this damping because the small number ( 14 ) of events is not yet sufficient to infer reliable information concerning the average phase fluctuation between the input and the output .",
    "this lack of phase correlation between forcing and response is explained by the threshold character of do events : the simulated events are triggered when the total forcing ( the sum of the two sinusoidal cycles and the noise ) crosses the threshold function .",
    "some of the threshold - crossings are in the first place caused by constructive interference of both cycles .",
    "these events coincide with near - minima of the two forcing cycles .",
    "other threshold - crossings are , however , in the first place caused by constructive interference of just one cycle and noise .",
    "these events thus coincide with a near - minimum of only that cycle ( compare figure 3 ) , whereas a fixed phase - relation with the second cycle does not necessarily exist . and at least for low signal - to - noise ratios , some of the threshold crossings are in the first place caused by the noise alone .",
    "these events thus do not show a fixed phase relation with any of the two forcing cycles .",
    "the inherently nonlinear noisy synchronization mechanism exhibited by our model is not unique to do events .",
    "in fact , it has originally been proposed to explain the perception of the pitch of complex sounds @xcite and , as a general concept , has already been used to describe theoretically and experimentally similar dynamics in other excitable @xcite or multi - stable systems with thresholds , e.g. in lasers @xcite . because of the fact that the leading output frequency is absent in the input , this type of resonance is called ghost stochastic resonance .",
    "we here used a simple model of do events , driven by a bi - sinusoidal forcing plus noise , to show that a fixed phase relation between the forcing cycles and _ all _ simulated events does not exist , apart from the unrealistic low noise limit .",
    "as argued above , in this model the fluctuations in the phases between the forcing and the response are related to the process giving rise to the transition itself .",
    "each event is generated by a threshold crossing resulting from a cooperative process between the two periodic driving forces ( i.e. , the centennial - scale input cycles ) and the stochastic fluctuations . in this nonlinear scenario , as we showed explicitly in our simulations , millennial - scale events with fixed input - output phase relations are impossible for any nonzero noise amplitude .    while one could disagree on the interpretation and the statistical significance of the pattern described in figure 1 ,",
    "our results show that the reported lack of a fixed phase relationship between 14 do events and solar proxies is consistent with the suggested solar role in synchronizing do events . at the same time our results have further implications for a second so - far unexplained oscillation during pleistocene climate , i.e. the glacial - interglacial cycles , which also show strong indications for the existence of threshold - like dynamics during glacial terminations @xcite : since the existence of a causal relation between threshold - crossing events and their quasi - periodic forcing does not necessarily imply the existence of a clear phase relation over _ all _ events , the lack of such a relation between glacial terminations on one hand and the orbital eccentricity and precession cycles on the other hand is not sufficient to reject a leading role of these cycles during terminations , in contrast to the interpretation proposed by @xcite .",
    "more insight in the cause of pleistocene climate cycles might thus be gained from more adequate statistical approaches , based e.g. on monte - carlo simulations @xcite with simple models @xcite that mimic the nonlinear dynamics which seems to be relevant during these oscillations .",
