    "ngc  6604 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) is a fairly compact open cluster belonging to class i3p ( ruprecht 1966 ) and lies at the core of the hii region s54 ( georgelin et al . 1973 ) .",
    "the fairly large extinction to the cluster ( @xmath9 ) is surely linked to the partnership with an hii region .",
    "the cluster contains several ob type stars ( stephenson and sanduleak 1971 ) , which suggest the cluster to be fairly young ( forbes and dupuy 1978 ) .",
    "its distance is rather uncertain , with estimates ranging from 0.7 to 4.4 kpc ( alter et al . 1970 ) .",
    "moffat and vogt ( 1975 , hereafter mv ) presented photoelectric photometry for a dozen stars in the cluster field , deriving a 1.6 kpc distance and a @xmath2=1.01 reddening .",
    "forbes and dupuy ( 1978 , hereafter fd ) performed photoelectric and photographic photometry , which yielded a 2.1 kpc distance , a @xmath2=0.96 reddening and a 4x10@xmath10 years age .",
    "they pointed out the possible presence of pre - zams members which demanded confirmation .",
    "in this paper we report about our ccd @xmath0 photometry of the cluster central area , medium resolution spectroscopy of a field larger than the cluster and high resolution echelle spectroscopy of the brightest cluster members .",
    "observations of ngc 6604 have been carried out with the ccd camera mounted on the 1.0 m telescope of the south africa astronomical observatory ( saao ) at sutherland on july 2 , 1992 .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  1 and a finding chart is presented in figure  1 .",
    "the surveyed area corresponds to @xmath11arcmin centered on the of star hd 167971 .",
    "the reader is referred to munari and carraro ( 1995 ) for the observing technique employed . as usual",
    ", we observed several e - regions standard stars to determine the extinction coefficients ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and the color equations :    @xmath15    the resulting @xmath16 magnitudes are listed in table  2 together with their internal errors .",
    "these ones average at @xmath17 0.0015 mag and increase only for stars fainter than @xmath18 mag for which photon statistics becomes the dominant source of noise .",
    "comparison between our ccd profile photometry ( daophot ) and the photoelectric observations of mv yields for the seven stars in common : @xmath19    .journal of observations .",
    "the last column is the fwhm of stellar images as measured on the ccd frames . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the _ v,(b  v ) _ and _ v,(v  i ) _ diagrams for the stars in table  2 are shown in figure  3 .",
    "stars # 10 and 27 , which have very red _ v  i _ colors laying well outside the diagram borders are not plotted .",
    "the situation for these two stars looks confuse ( and need additional observations to be settled ) , because # 10 has a _ b  v _ color that places it exactly on the zams , and # 27 ( which is too faint for a reliable measure on the @xmath20 frames ) appears too bright in @xmath21 to be a pre - zams cluster member .",
    "we started with a fit of the observed @xmath22 diagram to the zero age main sequence ( schmidt - kaler 1982 ) obtaining an apparent distance modulus @xmath23 and a mean reddening @xmath2 = 1.02 .",
    "then , the age was determined through trial fits to the observed main sequence with theoretical isochrones of the padova group ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) characterized by a standard @xmath24he / h@xmath25 $ ] ratio and solar metallicity and scaled to the distance modulus and reddening found before .",
    "the best fit , shown in figure  3 , is obtained for the isochrone corresponding to the age of 5@xmath26  years , slightly older than the value reported by fd .",
    "the resulting age is sensitive to the position in the color - magnitude diagram of star # 26 ( the brightest one ) and to a lesser extent of # 23 .",
    "both stars lie very close to the cluster center , their spectro - photometric parallax and reddening agree with the cluster distance and extinction , and furthermore the wide field spectroscopy of figure  2 and table  3 shows a marked drop of o - b stars outside the region covered by figure  1 .",
    "thus , it is quite safe to assume both stars as validated members of the cluster .",
    "the radial velocity of # 26 is @xmath27 off the mean of the other three cluster members in table  5 , which could suggest a binary nature .",
    "the contribution to the # 26 brightness by the possible companion can not be directly determined by the data at hand ; however it is worth noticing that ( @xmath28 ) the companion is not severly affecting the star colour , and ( @xmath29 ) its spectral features does not show up in our echelle spectra .",
    "thus the position of star # 26 in figure  3 should not be affected by a possible companion by more than a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "dimming star # 26 by 0.25 mag would change by no more than 1 million year the age estimate , for which we can therefore assume a safe 5(@xmath30)@xmath26  years .",
    "it may be of interest to note that feinstein et al .",
    "( 1986 ) have suggested that open clusters having stars with of characteristics like star #  26 should not be older than @xmath31 years ,    the distance to ngc 6604 is d = 1.7   kpc , for a r@xmath32=3.1 standard reddening law .",
    "such a distance is 25% smaller than found by fd , which is mainly based on photographic photometry , but quite in agreement to the value derived by mv and places the cluster at a galactocentric distance 6.9 kpc , on the outer boundary of the carina - sagittarius arm . adopting the zams in the _ ( b - v),(v - i ) _ as tabulated by munari and carraro ( 1996 )",
    ", a ratio @xmath33 is found for the reddening affecting ngc  6604 , in agreement with the value for the r@xmath32=3.1 standard reddening law .",
    "the fitting to isochrones in the _",
    "v , v@xmath34i _ plane is shown in figure  3 , with @xmath35 = 14.28 mag and @xmath36=1.32 as scaling factors , in agreement with the values from the _ v , b@xmath34v _ diagram . in view of the larger uncertainities affecting the transformations from the theoretical plane ( _ log _ l , _ log _ t ) to the observational one",
    "when red photometric bands are involved , the resulting isochrone fitting to the observational data seems satisfactory .    the spectroscopic data of table  3 for the four stars with detailed spectral classification ( #  2 , 21 , 23 , 24 ) give a mean reddening of @xmath37 , the same determined from photometry ( the star # 26 has not been considered because of its emission line nature ) .",
    "the mean reddening from interstellar lines from table  4 is @xmath38 .",
    "it seems noteworthy that three independent methods converge within 0.01 mag to the same @xmath39 value for the reddening affecting ngc  6604 .",
    "the mean spectroscopic apparent modulus @xmath40 mag for the cluster members in table  3 is in good agreement with the @xmath41 derived from zams fitting .",
    "finally , the data listed in table  5 give a cluster heliocentric radial velocity @xmath42 km  sec@xmath43 , in agreement with the @xmath44 km  sec@xmath43 of liu et al .",
    "the hron s ( 1987 ) rotation curve gives a heliocentric radial velocity of + 8.2@xmath45 km  sec@xmath43 at the galactic location of ngc 6604 .",
    "bearing in mind that the effect of the galactic rotation , as seen from the sun , nearly vanishes toward the galaxy center direction ( close to which ngc  6604 lies ) the resulting difference between model and observational velocities ( 12 km  sec@xmath43 ) is within the dispersion of the galactocentric radial velocities for extreme pop i objects ( 12.5 km  sec@xmath43 , binney and merrified 1998 )",
    ". therefore the cluster distance and position , its radial velocity and the hron s model for the galaxy disk rotation appear in good mutual agreement .",
    "our determination for the cluster distance and reddening confirm earlier studies . from the small dispersion around the cluster main sequence in figure  3",
    "we may conclude that most of the stars in figure  1 and table  2 are physical members of ngc  6604 . from the spatial concentration of early spectral types in table  3 , the diameter of ngc6604 is of the order of @xmath4610 arcmin .",
    "the @xmath39 reddening follows the standard r@xmath32=3.1 reddening law , with no evidence for a marked differential reddening over this cluster .",
    "the cluster age is estimated as @xmath31 years .",
    "our observations do not go faint enough to address the reality of the pre - zams objects suspected by fd . extrapolating from the turn - on tracks by stauffer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , pre - zams objects in ngc 6604 should have @xmath47 16 , corresponding to a zams spectral type somewhat later than a0 . thus , star # 14 ( which is @xmath462 mag off the zams ) looks too bright both for a pre - zams object and for an equal - mass binary , and therefore it should be a field star .    alter g. , ruprecht j. , vanysek j. 1970 , catalogue of star clusters and associations , budapest bertelli g. , bressan a. , chiosi c. , fagotto f. , nasi e. , 1994 , a&as , 106 , 275 binney j. , merrifield m. , 1998 , galactic astronomy , princeton university press feinstein a. , vazques r. a. , benvenuto o. g. , a&a , 159 , 223 fitzgerald m. p. , luiken m. , maitzen h. m. , moffat a. f. j. , 1979 , a&as 37 , 345 forbes d. , dupuy d. , 1978 , aj , 83 266 georgelin y. m. , georgelin y.p . , roux s. , 1973 , a&a 25 , 337 hron j. , 1987 , a&a 176 , 34 liu t. , janes k. a. , bania t. m. , 1991 , aj , 102 , 1103 moffat a. f. j. , vogt n. , 1975 , a&as , 20 , 155 munari u. , carraro g. , 1995 , mnras , 277 , 1269 munari u. , carraro g. , 1996 , a&a , 314 , 108 munari u. , zwitter t. , 1997 , a&a , 318 , 269 munari u. , tomasella l. , 1999 , a&a , 343 , 806 schmidt - kaler , th .",
