    "recent observations provide increasingly strong evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) exist and that they are the sources that power active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars ( see , e.g. , rees 1998 , for a summary and references ) .",
    "for example , the 1.3 cm maser - emission line of h@xmath5o allows for an extremely accurate mapping of gas motions in a disk at the core of the galaxy ngc 4258 .",
    "the inner edge of the disk has a radius of @xmath6 pc , and the inferred velocity profile is consistent with keplerian motion around a central object of @xmath7 ( claussen & lo 1986 ; watson & wallin 1994 ; miyoshi et .",
    "al . 1995 ) .",
    "the most conservative candidate for so massive an object in so small a volume is a black hole .",
    "however , the scenario by which smbhs form with masses in the range of @xmath8@xmath9 is still uncertain ( see rees 1984 for an overview ) .",
    "viable stellar dynamical and a hydrodynamical routes leading to the formation of smbhs have both been proposed .",
    "in one stellar dynamical scenario , the primordial gas first fragments into stars , which form a dense stellar cluster or galaxy core . repeated collisions and mergers of the stars in the cluster lead to the build - up of massive stars , and the subsequent collapse of the massive stars result in the formation of stellar - mass black holes . as these holes continue to swallow stars and grow , they settle toward the galaxy center , merge and trigger the build - up of one or more smbhs ( see , e.g. , quinlan & shapiro 1990 and references therein ) . in another dynamical scenario , the gravothermal catastrophe ( secular core collapse ) in a dense cluster composed of neutron stars or stellar - mass black holes",
    "may drive the cluster core to a relativistic state .",
    "sufficiently relativistic clusters are dynamically unstable to catastrophic collapse and may give birth to smbhs ( zeldovich & podurets 1965 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1985a , 1985b ; quinlan & shapiro 1987 )",
    ". it may be more likely that the contracting primordial gas builds up sufficient radiation pressure to inhibit further fragmentation and hence prevent the formation of a stellar cluster .",
    "alternatively , a supermassive gas cloud may build up from the fragmentation of stars in collisions in stellar clusters ( sanders 1970 ; begelman & rees 1978 ) .",
    "in such hydrodynamical scenarios , a massive black hole may form directly from gas , perhaps after a phase in which the gas evolves in a quasistationary manner as a supermassive star ( sms ) .",
    "such a phase can only be transient , since ultimately general relativity will drive such stars dynamically unstable ( iben 1963 ; chandrasekhar 1964a , b ; feynman , unpublished , as quoted in fowler 1964 ) .",
    "the structure and evolution of supermassive stars up to the onset of instability has been explored previously by many authors , including hoyle & fowler ( 1963a , b ) , fowler ( 1964 , 1966 ) , bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov ( 1967 ) , appenzeller & fricke ( 1972 ) and fuller , woosley and weaver ( 1986 ) ( see zeldovich & novikov , 1971 , and shapiro and teukolsky , 1983 , for reviews and further references ) .",
    "in addition to their importance for a fundamental understanding of agns and quasars , supermassive objects and the formation of smbhs have recently attracted new interest because they are likely candidates for detection by currently proposed space - based gravitational wave detectors like the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "because of its long arm length , this detector would be very sensitive to long wavelength and low frequency radiation , and therefore supermassive objects are among the most promising sources ( see , e.g. , thorne & braginsky 1976 ; thorne 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , lisa may be able to detect the collapse of a sms to a smbh .",
    "even more promising is the possible detection of the coalescence of two smbhs ( lisa pre - phase a report 1995 ) .",
    "the likelihood of such an event , however , largely depends on how smbhs form and is therefore still uncertain .    in a series of papers we revisit the formation of smbhs via the collapse of smss , focussing on the influence of rotation and general relativity . we analyze the secular contraction of a uniformly rotating equilibrium configuration via thermal emission and mass loss .",
    "we concentrate on a configuration rotating at the mass - shedding limit . in baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ,",
    "hereafter paper i ) , we have shown that the luminosity from such a star is considerably reduced below the value of a nonrotating spherical star of the same mass .    in this paper , we analyze the structure and stability against collapse of fully relativistic , rotating @xmath10 polytropes in stationary equilibrium .",
    "smss to which these calculations apply are radiation - dominated , isentropic configurations of sufficient mass that neither nuclear burning nor electron - positron pairs are important before the stars reaches the onset of relativistic gravitational instability . stars with @xmath11 fall in this category ( zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; fuller , woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "moreover , the evolutionary timescale due to cooling has to be longer than the hydrodynamic timescale for the star to evolve in a quasistationary fashion . according to equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) below",
    ", we find that this constraint is satisfied for all masses @xmath12 .",
    "we track the quasistationary evolution of such stars to the point of onset of radial instability .",
    "we first identify this critical configuration analytically by means of a post - newtonian energy variational method .",
    "as pointed out by bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov ( 1967 ) , determining the onset of relativistic collapse in a rapidly rotating sms requires a _ second - order _ post - newtonian analysis , not a first - order , as in the case of a nonrotating star .",
    "we provide an approximate , post - newtonian analytic analysis ( rigorizing and completing the qualitative argument of bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov ( 1967 ) and zeldovich & novikov ( 1971 ) , who only provide a dimensional estimate of the second post - newtonian term ) .",
    "then , to establish the result rigorously , we use a recent numerical code ( cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1992 , 1994 ) to construct rotating equilibrium models in full general relativity .",
    "we show that the mass of the critical configuration is a unique function of the specific entropy .",
    "the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the onset of collapse are universal numbers , independent of the mass or prior evolution . here",
    "@xmath13 is the mass , @xmath14 the ( polar ) radius , @xmath15 the angular momentum , @xmath3 the rotational and @xmath4 the gravitational potential energy of the star .",
    "we also speculate on the likely outcome of collapse for stars which do not disrupt due to thermonuclear explosions during collapse ; it is found that stars with @xmath16 and initial metallicities @xmath17 do not explode ( fuller , woosley & weaver 1986 ) . since these stars start collapsing from a universal critical configuration , the subsequent collapse is also uniquely determined and should produce a unique gravitational waveform .",
    "we postpone a detailed discussion of this phase for a future paper in which we follow the dynamical collapse numerically in general relativity ( baumgarte , shapiro & shibata 1999 ) .",
    "the key goals of our study are to decide whether a smbh can really emerge from the collapse of a sms and to determine the hole parameters if indeed it can be formed this way . alternatively",
    ", a rotating supermassive cloud or star could collapse to a weakly relativistic disk ( e.g.  wagoner 1969 ; loeb & rasio 1994 ) .",
    "if the collapsing innermost region enters the strong - field domain , the angular momentum of this matter must be below the maximum value of a kerr hole ( @xmath18 ) for black hole formation to occur eventually . what happens if the angular momentum exceeds this limit ?",
    "does angular momentum dissipation by outflowing gas allow for black hole formation of the core ? or ,",
    "does gravitational radiation , following the formation of bars or axial currents carry away enough angular momentum to permit collapse ?",
    "finally , if a smbh can form by the collapse of a sms , what is its mass and spin given the mass and spin of the sms at the onset of collapse ?    in this paper we deal primarily with the structure , stability and early secular evolution phases of the sms scenario .",
    "our calculation , in effect , sets up the initial data at the onset of collapse .",
    "tracking the subsequent dynamical evolution of these initial data will resolve the key questions posed above , and in this paper we will only speculate briefly on the outcome of the dynamical collapse .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we provide a qualitative overview of the problem and present our basic assumptions . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the equilibrium and stability of rotating , relativistic smss .",
    "in particular ,",
    "we determine the critical configuration at which an evolving sms becomes dynamically unstable to radial perturbations .",
    "we compare results from an approximate analytical treatment ( section  [ anal ] ) with those from a numerical , fully relativistic calculation ( section  [ numerics ] ) .",
    "having identified the onset of instability , we then solve analytically for the evolution of smss during the secular contraction phase up to this critical configuration in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "in section  [ coll ] we provide some qualitative arguments which suggest that the direct formation of smbhs from the collapse of smss indeed may be possible . we summarize and discuss our results in section  [ summary ] . except where noted otherwise",
    ", we adopt geometrized units with @xmath19 throughout this paper .",
    "smss may form if collapsing primordial gas builds up enough entropy so that the radiation pressure can slow down the collapse ( see begelman & rees , 1978 , for an alternative scenario ) .",
    "further contraction will then spin up the newly formed sms to the mass - shedding limit , provided that the gas had some initial angular momentum and that viscosity maintains uniform rotation .",
    "the sms will then evolve secularly along the mass - shedding limit , simultaneously emitting radiation , matter and angular momentum ( see , e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1967 ; zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) .",
    "once it reaches the onset of radial instability , the star collapses on a dynamical timescale , and may ultimately form a smbh .    for sufficiently massive objects ( @xmath11 ) , the equation of state",
    "is dominated by thermal radiation pressure .",
    "it can also be shown that smss are convective ( see loeb & rasio 1994 , for a simple proof ) with constant entropy per baryon , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the baryon density and @xmath22 is the radiation density constant .",
    "these conditions imply that the structure of a sms is that of an @xmath10 polytrope @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( see eq .  17.2.6 in shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . here",
    ", @xmath25 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath26 has been evaluated for a composition of pure ionized hydrogen . in newtonian theory , the mass of a static , equilibrium @xmath10 polytrope is _ uniquely _ determined by the polytropic constant @xmath26 alone @xmath27 ( the numerical coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 , derived from lane - emden functions , are given in table  1 below ) .",
    "inverting this relation , we can write @xmath26 in terms of @xmath13 as @xmath30 since @xmath10 polytropes are extremely centrally condensed , the self - gravity of the outermost envelope of a uniformly rotating configuration can be neglected and the roche approximation ( see section  [ roche ] ) can be applied .    in newtonian gravitation ,",
    "@xmath10 polytropes are marginally stable to radial collapse .",
    "however , even very small general relativistic corrections make these polytropes unstable , and some mechanism has to be invoked to prevent collapse . in this paper",
    ", we focus on rotation , which up to a critical configuration along the mass - shedding sequence can stabilize smss . in section  [ sec3 ] we will identify this critical configuration ( which we will call `` configuration @xmath31 '' ) .",
    "alternatively , gas pressure may stabilize smss in the absence of angular momentum ( see zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) , but even a small degree of rotation will dominate gas pressure ( cf .  section  [ anal ] ) .",
    "a dark matter background also tends to have a stabilizing effect ( fuller , woosley & weaver , 1986 ) , but it is also much less important than rotation ( bisnovatyi - kogan 1998 ) . since the ratio between the rotational kinetic and the potential energy , @xmath1 , is always very small for a uniformly rotating star during secular evolution along the mass - shedding sequence ( see eq .",
    "[ [ t_ms ] ] and figure  [ fig4 ] ) , it is unlikely that nonradial modes of instability are important during this phase . once the star has become unstable and collapses , however , @xmath1 can become very large , and it is likely that such nonradial modes develop ( see section  [ coll ] )",
    ".    massive enough stars ( @xmath11 ) do not reach sufficiently high temperatures for nuclear burning to become important before reaching the onset of instability ( see  section  [ sec3.4 ] ) . also , electron - positron pairs play a negligible role in this regime ( zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) .",
    "the evolution of the sms along the mass - shedding sequence is then determined solely by cooling via thermal photon emission and loss of mass and angular momentum . as we have shown in paper i",
    ", the luminosity of a rotating supermassive star at mass - shedding is @xmath32 where the eddington luminosity is @xmath33 the opacity @xmath34 is dominated by thomson scattering off free electrons @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hydrogen mass fraction . for @xmath37",
    ", temperatures are low enough that klein - nishina corrections can be neglected ( see , e.g. , fuller , woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "as we will find in section  [ sec4 ] , the evolutionary timescale for secular evolution along the mass - shedding sequence is given by @xmath38 where the coefficient has been evaluated near the critical configuration ( see eq .",
    "( [ tcrit_value ] ) ) .",
    "the dynamical timescale is @xmath39 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ rho_value ] ) below to evaluate @xmath40 in terms of the non - dimensional density @xmath41 .",
    "given the critical values for @xmath41 and @xmath0 that we find in section  [ sec3 ] , the evolutionary timescale is longer than the dynamical timescale for @xmath42 .",
    "this mass is larger than the value derived in shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) , where a similar estimate has been made for nonrotating smss stabilized by gas pressure .    also important",
    "is the viscous timescale , which is very uncertain .",
    "not surprisingly , the microscopic viscosity due either to collisions between ions or to radiation yields timescales which are larger than the evolutionary timescale by many orders of magnitude ( see kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",
    "the effect of turbulent viscosity can be estimated by assuming that the velocity of the turbulent motion @xmath43 is an appreciable fraction of the velocity of sound , @xmath44 where we take the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath45 to lie in the range @xmath46 ( see shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; also zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "assuming the characteristic scale of nonuniformity to be some fraction of the stellar radius @xmath14 , we can then estimate the turbulent viscosity to be @xmath47 the corresponding timescale is then @xmath48 it has been argued that both convection and magnetic fields serve to generate such a turbulent viscosity in smss ( bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1967 ; wagoner 1969 ) .    for smss with masses",
    "@xmath49 , we therefore find the hierarchy @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ time_hier ] ) justifies our assumption that the star evolves in a quasistationary manner along the mass - shedding sequence .",
    "the last inequality implies that turbulent viscosity , if present , will keep the sms in uniform rotation .",
    "we will assume this result in treating the secular evolution up to the onset of instability .",
    "once the star becomes unstable and starts collapsing , however , the evolution will proceed on the dynamical timescale , and it is unlikely that the viscosity will be efficient enough to maintain uniform rotation .",
    "it is more likely that cylindrical mass shells will conserve their angular momentum , which we assume for our qualitative arguments in section  [ coll ] .",
    "in this section we analyze the equilibrium and stability of rotating smss and identify the critical configuration at which radial instability sets in .",
    "we briefly review the predictions of the roche approximation in section  [ roche ] . in section",
    "[ anal ] we present an analytic , post - newtonian model calculation , which provides qualitative insight into the scaling behavior and approximate numerical parameters for the critical configuration . in section  [ numerics ] ,",
    "we present numerical results from a fully relativistic calculation , which allows us to identify the critical configuration and its characteristic parameters ( including @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) independently of the approximations used in the analytical treatment ( including the post - newtonian and roche approximation ) .",
    "we find remarkable agreement between the two calculations .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec3.4 ] , we restore cgs units and provide expressions for the physical parameters in smss .",
    "the roche approximation for rotating @xmath10 polytropes has been derived and discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the key elements for application below ( see also paper i ) .",
    "stars with soft equations of state are extremely centrally condensed : they have an extended , low density envelope , with the bulk of the mass concentrated in the core . for an @xmath10 polytrope , for example",
    ", the ratio between central density to average density is @xmath51",
    ". the gravitational forces in the envelope are therefore dominated by the massive core , and it is appropriate to neglect the self - gravity of the envelope . in this case , it is easy to show that matter at the equator of a rotating star orbits with the kepler frequency when the ratio between the equatorial radius @xmath52 and the polar radius @xmath53 reaches @xmath54 at this point , the angular velocity of the star assumes its maximum value before mass - shedding from the equator sets in : @xmath55 the polar radius hardly changes from the value of the radius of the nonrotating , spherical star , a result which has been verified numerically ( papaloizou & whelan 1973 ) . since the bulk of the matter",
    "is concentrated at the core and hardly affected by the rotation , the moment of inertia of inertia of the star barely changes with rotation and is well approximated by the nonrotating value @xmath56 where the brackets denote a mass weighted average over the star , and where the last equality holds for @xmath57 ( this approximation turns out to be less accurate ; cf .  section  [ numerics ] ) .",
    "the ratio between the kinetic and potential energy at mass - shedding then becomes @xmath58 this result predicts that @xmath1 of a maximally rotating , @xmath57 polytrope ( or any star for which the roche approximation applies ) is a universal constant , independent of mass , radius , or orbital velocity . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we will see that precise numerical models predict a somewhat larger value of @xmath1 , which nevertheless also remains approximately constant along a mass - shedding trajectory ( see figure  [ fig4 ] below ) .      to determine the equilibrium and stability of a rotating sms , we write its total energy as the sum of the internal energy @xmath59 , the potential energy @xmath4 , the rotational energy @xmath3 , a post - newtonian correction @xmath60 and a post - post - newtonian correction @xmath61 . for a @xmath10 polytrope",
    ", these terms can be written @xmath62      & & k_3 j^2 m^{7/3 } \\rho_c^{2/3 }       - k_4 m^{7/3 } \\rho_c^{2/3 } - k_5 m^3 \\rho_c , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath63 and have neglected corrections due to deviations from sphericity .",
    "this neglect is justified , since these corrections scale with @xmath1 , which according to  ( [ t_ms ] ) is always very small . even though the value of the post - post - newtonian correction @xmath61 is very small , this term is crucial for determining the critical , marginally stable configuration , as emphasized by zeldovich and novikov ( 1971 ) .",
    "the values of the nondimensional coefficients @xmath64 are listed in table  1 ; they are constructed from lane - emden functions .",

    "we can therefore introduce nondimensional coordinates by setting @xmath66 ( see also cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1992 ) .",
    "we will denote values of nondimensional variables in these coordinates with a bar ( for example @xmath67 ) .",
    "values of these quantities for any other value of @xmath26 can be recovered easily by rescaling with an appropriate power of @xmath68 ; for example @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "taking the first derivative of  ( [ energy ] ) with respect to the central density yields a condition for equilibrium @xmath71      & & 2 k_4 \\bar m^{7/3 } x - 3 k_5 \\bar m^3 x^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 . for stable equilibrium , the second derivative of eq .",

    "smss with angular momenta less than @xmath80 can also be stabilized by the nonvanishing contribution of the plasma , which effectively decreases the polytropic index @xmath81 to a value slightly smaller than 3 ( see shapiro & teukolsky 1983 , chapt .",

    "the sequences are monotonically increasing , while below they are monotonically decreasing .",
    "the thick solid line in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] connects the turning points , and therefore separates a region of stable equilibrium ( above the line ) , from a region of unstable equilibrium ( below the line ) .",
    "as it cools , a supermassive star evolves toward higher density along the mass - shedding sequence and is therefore stabilized by rotation until it reaches point @xmath31 .",
    "at this point , the star becomes unstable to radial perturbations and will collapse .",
    "we summarize the numerical parameters characterizing point @xmath31 in table  2 , where they are compared with the findings of the analytical model calculation of section  [ anal ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the density profile at the critical point @xmath31 in a plane containing the axis of rotation .",
    "note that the numerical accuracy of an individual stellar model is fairly high . from the agreement of the limiting value @xmath86 ( solid dot in figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) with the theoretical value ( open circle )",
    ", we estimate the numerical errors to be much less than 1 % . identifying the critical point @xmath31",
    ", however , requires locating the turning points along fairly flat curves , which therefore introduces a larger error .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that we can identify the characteristical parameters of point @xmath31 to , typically , within less than 5% .",
    "some of these parameters , however , change only very little along the mass - shedding sequence and can therefore by determined to much higher accuracy ( for example @xmath1 ) .",
    "the number of digits in table  2 reflects the uncertainty in each parameter .",
    "having constructed self - consistent models of rotating @xmath10 polytropes , we can now evaluate the quality of the predictions of the roche approximation ( see section  [ roche ] ) .",
    "we find that the predictions concerning the envelope alone , namely the ratio between equatorial and polar radius and the orbital frequency at mass shedding , are very accurate ( table 2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] also shows that , at mass - shedding , only the envelope is distorted , while the core of the star remains nearly spherical . to predict @xmath1 at mass - shedding ,",
    "the roche approximation assumes the moment of inertia as well as the potential energy of the distorted star to be that of the corresponding spherical star , which yields @xmath122 , independent of @xmath41 . in reality , the moment of inertia will be larger for the rotating star ( by about 15% for configuration @xmath31 , see the last column in table  2 ) , and the magnitude of the potential energy slightly smaller .",
    "accordingly , we find that the roche approximation underestimates @xmath1 by about 20% .",
    "we also find that @xmath1 is not independent of @xmath41 ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , over our region of interest , @xmath1 changes by much less than 1% , so that it can very well be approximated by and @xmath4 numerically are given in cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1992 ) , eq .",
    "( 56 ) and  ( 65 ) ] @xmath123 ( cf .",

    "the temperature can now be found , for example , from eq .",
    "( 17.2.9 ) in shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) @xmath129 for smss with masses @xmath11 , the central temperature is always less than @xmath130 . according to fowler ( 1966 ) ,",
    "this is the minimum temperature required for generating the sms s luminosity via the cno cycle .",
    "this justifies our assumption that nuclear reactions can be neglected .",
    "in this section we discuss the evolution of a rotating sms up to the onset of instability .",
    "in particular , we derive analytic expressions for the evolution of the mass , radius and angular momentum as a function of time .    the evolution of the three quantities is not independent . instead",
    ", they are coupled by two relations , namely the requirement that the star evolves along mass - shedding ( so that @xmath1 remains approximately constant ) , and that the angular momentum loss can be computed from the mass that leaves that star from the equator with the critical angular velocity .",
    "this means that we can express , for instance , the angular momentum loss @xmath131 and the change of radius @xmath132 in terms of the mass loss @xmath133 .",
    "the only relation that is yet to be determined fixes @xmath133 and hence the overall timescale for the evolution of the three quantities .    in a similar calculation , bisnovatyi - kogan ,",
    "zeldovich & novikov ( 1967 ) estimated @xmath133 by constructing an approximate stellar wind model , which they joined onto the outer envelope of the star .",
    "their model depends on several unknown nondimensional parameters dealing with the wind solution . here",
    ", we take a much more naive approach , determining the mass loss rate from the requirement that the star remain in equilibrium as it cools in a quasistationary manner .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ m_newton_k ] ) , the mass loss rate is related to the change of @xmath26 ( or the entropy ) , and is thus governed by the star s luminosity ( see eq .",
    "( [ mdot2 ] ) below ) .    as we have seen in section  [ anal ] , the post - newtonian corrections and rotational contributions to the energy functional  ( [ energy ] ) are important for determining the stability of smss , but they have a very small effect on the equilibrium structure and can therefore be neglected for the purposes of this section .",
    "accordingly , the mass @xmath13 of the star is well approximated by the newtonian expression  ( [ m_newton_k ] ) , which only depends on the polytropic constant @xmath26 .",
    "the time derivative of the mass is given by @xmath134 the change of the total entropy @xmath135 of the star is related the luminosity by @xmath136 using the first law of thermodynamics , the right hand side can be rewritten @xmath137 where @xmath59 is the internal energy ( see baumgarte & shapiro 1998 , eq .

    "for @xmath10 polytropes in equilibrium , the internal energy is equal to the negative of the gravitational potential energy @xmath138 ( see eq .",

    "similar expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be found by inserting  ( [ mdot5 ] ) into  ( [ rdot3 ] ) and  ( [ jdot3 ] ) : @xmath166 using the identity @xmath167 , we find that the dimensionless quantities @xmath2 and @xmath0 evolve according to @xmath168 we plot @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 as a function of time in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "note that @xmath2 and @xmath0 evolve on the timescale @xmath164 , which is why we adopt this value for our estimates in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the mass @xmath13 and similarly @xmath26 , however , effectively evolve on a much longer timescale , which is a consequence of the small numerical value of the exponent @xmath169 .",
    "once the supermassive star becomes unstable , it will start to collapse on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the outcome of this collapse depends on many factors , and can be determined only with a numerical , three - dimensional hydrodynamics simulation in general relativity .",
    "such a calculation is only now underway ( baumgarte , shapiro & shibata 1999 ) .",
    "the only dynamical , fully relativistic simulations of the collapse of smss have been performed for nonrotating configurations in spherical symmetry ( see , for example , shapiro & teukolsky , 1979 ) , for which black hole formation is well established .",
    "these calculations , however , do not shed much light on the problem at hand , since rotation may play a crucial role in the dynamical evolution .",
    "the issue of the final fate of a collapsing , rapidly rotating sms can therefore only be resolved by nonspherical , relativistic numerical simulations .    in the meantime , however , we can attempt to assess crudely whether this collapse can actually lead to the formation of a supermassive black hole . to do so",
    ", we assume that each mass shell conserves its angular momentum during the collapse ( cf .  the discussion at the end of section  [ sec2 ] ) , and consider two criteria .",
    "first , a particle can only be captured by a black hole if it is not be repelled by the angular momentum barrier . for simplicity , we take the newly formed black hole to be a schwarzschild black hole , in which case a particle is in a capture orbit if @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the particle s specific angular momentum , and @xmath172 the mass of the black hole . here",
    "we ignore the effects of pressure , assuming that in relativistic collapse the matter approaches the nascent black hole supersonically by the time it enters the strong field domain .",
    "second , for any portion of the star to form a kerr black hole , the angular momentum @xmath15 of that portion can not be larger than the square of its mass @xmath172 @xmath173 we crudely evaluate these two criteria neglecting post - newtonian corrections and nonspherical distortions due to rotation .",
    "the specific angular momentum of a particle at radius @xmath174 in the equatorial plane , at the onset of instability , is @xmath175 where the critical orbital velocity @xmath176 can be written @xmath177 here , @xmath178 is the uniquely determined value at the onset of instability ( see table  2 ) . inserting the last two equations into  ( [ crit1 ] ) , we find @xmath179 where we have assumed that the mass of the black hole , @xmath172 , is the mass enclosed by a sphere of radius @xmath174 .",

    "the values of @xmath181 and @xmath186 at the surface of the star are @xmath187 and @xmath188 . using  ( [ le_var ] ) and  ( [ le_mass ] )",
    ", we find that  ( [ crit1_1 ] ) reduces to a criterion on @xmath189 alone : @xmath190 where we have adopted @xmath178 for the critical configuration .",
    "we plot @xmath191 as a function of @xmath181 in the top panel of figure  6 , and mark the threshold value @xmath192 by the horizontal line .",
    "a particle at a radius for which @xmath191 is greater than this value can be captured , if the regions interior to this radius have collapsed to a black hole . for @xmath193",
    ", @xmath191 is less than the capture threshold , and therefore the angular momentum barrier would prevent these regions from being caught by a newly formed , interior black hole . for the outermost regions ,",
    "this is not surprising , since the configuration is critically rotating .",
    "therefore , the outer region may remain in orbit , perhaps in a circumstellar disk , even if the rest of the star has collapsed .",
    "however , from the middle panel in figure  6 we find that this outer region only contains @xmath194 of the mass , while about 95% of the mass could form a black hole .",
    "this , again , is a consequence of @xmath10 polytropes being extremely centrally condensed .",
    "according to figure  6 , the angular momentum barrier would also prevent particles at very small radii , @xmath195 , from being captured by a black hole interior to that radius .",
    "however , for this to be relevant , the initial black hole would have to be restricted to a very small fractional size , and as we will see below , the second criterion  ( [ crit2 ] ) does not allow such small black holes to form .    we may reverse the above argument and view eq .",
    "( [ crit1_2 ] ) as a condition on @xmath0 .",
    "since the left hand side , @xmath191 , has a maximum of about 6.6 , @xmath0 has to be smaller than about 2350 for black hole formation to be possible .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath0 of the critical configuration @xmath31 is only about five times smaller than this threshold compaction , just barely allowing the supermassive star to form a supermassive black hole .",
    "this argument suggests that primordial gas may have to pass through a phase as a sms where it can lose angular momentum before it can possibly collapse to a smbh .",
    "we can similarly evaluate the second criterion , eq .",
    "( [ crit2 ] ) , in terms of lane - emden functions .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath196 of the matter enclosed within radius @xmath174 , rotating with the critical angular velocity , can be written @xmath197       & = & \\big ( \\frac{2}{3 } \\big)^{3/2 }       \\big ( \\frac{r}{m } \\big)_{\\rm crit}^{1/2 } \\frac{m}{r^2 }      \\frac{8 \\pi}{3 } \\int_0^r \\rho r^4 d r \\\\[1 mm ]      & = &   \\big ( \\frac{2}{3 } \\big)^{5/2 }       \\big ( \\frac{r}{m } \\big)^{1/2}_{\\rm crit }      ( 4 \\pi)^2 a^6 \\rho_c^2 |\\theta'(\\xi_1)|       \\int_0^{\\xi } \\theta^n \\xi^4 d\\xi . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] dividing this by the square of the mass , eq .",
    "( [ le_mass ] ) , then yields the condition @xmath198 in the bottom panel of figure  6 we show the right hand side of this equation for a @xmath10 polytrope and for @xmath199 . the dotted , horizontal line is the critical value of unity .",
    "a region inside a radius @xmath181 can form a kerr black hole only if @xmath200 is less than unity .",
    "this condition is satisfied everywhere except for the innermost regions @xmath201 . at the surface ,",
    "@xmath202 , we recover the value @xmath203 found in eq .",
    "( [ crit_values ] ) .",
    "note that for any polytrope , @xmath172 is proportional to @xmath204 for small radii @xmath174 and @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , @xmath206 scales like @xmath207 close to the center , which prevents the formation of arbitrarily small black holes from rotating polytropes . in our case , the region inside @xmath208 , containing about 4% of the total mass , defines the minimum mass which can collapse to form an initial black hole .",
    "since @xmath191 exceeds the threshold for @xmath209 , such a `` minimal '' seed black hole could accrete further material from the star .",
    "finally , we note that a bar instability may form during the collapse of the star .",
    "the criterion for the formation of a bar on a dynamical timescale is @xmath210 ( see , e.g. , chandrasekhar 1969 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "since @xmath13 and @xmath15 are approximately conserved during the collapse , @xmath1 scales with @xmath211 , so a bar will start to form when @xmath212 the value of @xmath0 at bar formation is then @xmath213 eg .  ( [ r_bar ] ) suggests that the collapsing star may form a nonaxisymmetric bar before it forms a black hole .",
    "this is an important result , since such a bar may result in a quasiperiodic emission of gravitational waves ( cf .",
    "smith , houser & centrella 1996 ) .",
    "the frequency of these waves can be estimated from the expected bar rotation rate @xmath214 for a sms of @xmath215 this yields a frequency of @xmath216 hz , which is in the range in which lisa is expected to be most sensitive ( see , e.g. , thorne 1995 ) .",
    "the frequency increases at later stages of the collapse , when @xmath217 becomes larger .",
    "the strength of the gravitational wave signal can be crudely estimated to be @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the star s quadrupole moment , and @xmath220 is the distance , which we scale to 1 gpc ( the hubble distance is @xmath221 gpc ) .",
    "the signal strength increases with @xmath217 at late stages of the collapse . apart from any bar",
    ", the implosion itself will be nonspherical , due to rotation , and will result in a gravitational wave burst .",
    "the collapse of a supermassive star may therefore be a very promising candidate for detection by space based gravitational wave detectors ( lisa pre - phase a report 1995 ) .    obviously",
    ", the arguments presented in this section are very crude and do not replace a fully self - consistent relativistic hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "our arguments nevertheless suggest that , upon reaching the onset of instability , supermassive stars may form a supermassive black hole , containing a large part of the mass , and leaving only a few percent of the initial mass outside of the black hole , most likely in the form of a disk .",
    "we furthermore anticipate that a bar may form during the collapse , which may lead to the emission of quasiperiodic gravitational waves .",
    "we have launched a fully relativistic study of the formation of smbhs via the collapse of smss . in this paper",
    "we study the quasistationary , secular evolution of smss up to the critical configuration at which radial instability sets in and focus on the effects of rotation and general relativity .",
    "we identify the critical configuration and its characteristic parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these parameters are independent of the mass of the sms , and are therefore universal constants .",
    "the subsequent implosion , starting from this universal critical configuration , is therefore also uniquely determined and should produce a unique gravitational waveform .",
    "we compare results from an analytic , approximate treatment and a fully relativistic , numerical calculation , and find good agreement .",
    "we furthermore solve analytically for the time evolution of these parameters up to the onset of instability .",
    "identifying the critical configuration at the onset of instability is interesting for its own sake .",
    "more importantly , however , this configuration will be adopted as initial data for future numerical simulations of sms collapse ( baumgarte , shapiro & shibata 1999 ) . in this paper",
    "we assemble qualitative arguments to anticipate the outcome of the collapse and find that the formation of a smbh containing an appreciable fraction of the mass is not ruled out .",
    "our arguments suggest that a transient phase as a sms may be an efficient way for primordial gas to lose sufficient angular momentum in order to overcome the kerr angular momentum barrier to forming a smbh .",
    "loeb & rasio ( 1994 ) have emphasized that smbhs appear to have a minimum `` observed '' mass of @xmath222 .",
    "our crude arguments may help to explain this minimum in the context of the sms formation scenario .",
    "smss with masses less than this value will not evolve in a quasistationary manner up to our critical configuration @xmath31 , because some of our assumptions break down .",
    "for example , nuclear burning may cause the star to explode ( appenzeller & fricke 1972 , fuller , woosley & weaver , 1986 ) .",
    "electron - positron pairs may also be important for small masses , and may destabilize the star ( see zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) before it reaches a small enough value of @xmath0 to overcome the angular momentum barrier . on the other hand ,",
    "all smss with @xmath11 will evolve in a quasistationary manner until reaching the critical configuration @xmath31",
