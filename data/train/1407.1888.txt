    "the study of equilibration in many - particle quantum systems has moved into the focus of recent research interest .",
    "@xcite this interest has been partially driven by the impressive experimental progress in realizing and manipulating many - particle quantum systems .",
    "one remarkable example is the recent cold atom realization of the tonks girardeau gas , which allowed to study the suppression of relaxation in an integrable many - body system .",
    "@xcite    clean mesoscopic quantum wires provide another example of systems in which equilibration is strongly suppressed .",
    "@xcite specifically , in clean single channel quantum wires equilibration is due to backscattering of excitations which occur at energies of the order of their bandwidth @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , the equilibration rate displays activated temperature dependence , @xmath1 and , when exposed to a finite voltage bias , a fully equilibrated steady state only occurs in wires exceeding an _ exponentially large _ length scale @xmath2 .",
    "in shorter wires , @xmath3 , effects of equilibration on electrons at the fermi level can be neglected and signatures of relaxation are due to backscattering of particles close to the band bottom .",
    "@xcite the key process for relaxation in this case is one in which a thermally activated hole overcomes , as it scatters from excitations at the fermi level , a barrier of energetically unfavorable states at the band bottom via random small steps in momentum space .",
    "this picture of a brownian particle applies regardless of the interaction strength and thus opens the possibility to study equilibration of one - dimensional fermions beyond the weak interaction regime .",
    "strongly interacting electrons are commonly described within the luttinger liquid framework and previous work has studied scattering of a brownian particle in a homogeneous luttinger liquid .",
    "@xcite the focus of the present paper is on the equilibration in voltage biased quantum wires . here",
    ", the nature of the specific boundary conditions requires to address a space - dependent , i.e. _ inhomogeneous _ problem .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : backscatt ] introduces the backscattering rate of holes and reviews how a finite rate affects the conductance of the wire . in section  [ sec : fokpla ] we discuss the relevant kinetic equation .",
    "solutions of the latter , the resulting backscattering rate and interaction - induced correction to the conductance of the wire are discussed in sections  [ sec : idr ] and  [ sec : longwires ] . details of the calculations are relegated to the appendices .",
    "consider interacting electrons in a clean one - dimensional quantum wire adiabatically connected to two - dimensional reservoirs via fully transparent contacts .",
    "a non - equilibrium situation arises when reservoirs at left and right contacts are biased by a finite voltage @xmath4 .",
    "then , right- and left - moving electrons injected into the wire from the left and right reservoir , respectively , are at different equilibria , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the absence of interactions",
    "the conductance of the wire reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the quantum of conductance , and @xmath7 is the chemical potential .",
    "accounting for interactions within the luttinger liquid framework , the conductance of a finite wire remains @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite while electrons inside a realistic voltage biased wire relax towards a new steady state , excitations within the luttinger liquid model have an infinite life time . to study effects of equilibration on finite temperature transport coefficients ,",
    "one thus has to go beyond the luttinger liquid model . as we discuss below , this",
    "can be accomplished even if interactions are strong .    taking into account relaxation into a new steady state",
    ", the latter can be characterized in terms of a local backscattering rate @xmath9 of fermions . in the limit of weak interactions , @xmath10 is the density of right - moving electrons .",
    "the dot here and in the following refers to the total time derivative , @xmath11 is the fermi distribution of ( weakly interacting ) electrons and the factor @xmath12 is due to spin - degeneracy .",
    "the total backscattering rate of electrons is then @xmath13 and a finite rate results from backscattering of highly excited holes close to the band bottom , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the above picture readily generalizes to strong interactions .",
    "indeed , one can extend the concept of a hole excitation to arbitrary interaction strengths by noting that for a system with concave spectrum the lowest energy excitation at a given momentum @xmath14 is a hole .",
    "@xcite even though interactions renormalize its spectrum @xmath15 , the hole remains a spin-@xmath16 excitation with a two - fold degeneracy of the energy levels protected by spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "the energy spectrum is periodic , @xmath17 , and quasi - momenta of hole excitations may thus be restricted to the first brillouin zone @xmath18 . building on this observation , a backscattering event corresponds to an umklapp process in which the highly excited hole crosses the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "notice here that the edge of the brillouin zone corresponds to the band bottom of the spectrum of the non - interacting fermions , and both terms will be used synonymously below , see also fig .",
    "in particular , in both pictures the relaxation is due to processes taking place at the bottom of the band , i.e. involving highly excited holes .",
    "to simplify notation , in the subsequent discussion instead of the momentum of the hole @xmath14 measured from the nearest fermi point we will use the momentum of the missing electron near the bottom of the band , @xmath19 .",
    "regardless of the interaction strength the total backscattering rate of holes is calculated in terms of the hole distribution @xmath20 , @xmath21 in the short wires considered in this paper the backscattering rate ( [ bsr ] ) is controlled by momenta close to the band bottom @xmath22 .",
    "we will discuss the hole occupation numbers @xmath20 in the following sections .",
    "the factor of 2 in eq .",
    "again results from spin - degeneracy , and the minus sign from expressing the backscattering rate in terms of the hole distribution .",
    "a finite backscattering rate manifests in a reduced steady state current,@xcite @xmath23 corresponding to a conductance which differs from that of a non - interacting system , @xmath24    the backscattering rate recently has been studied in the limit of relatively short  @xcite ( @xmath25 ) and relatively long ( @xmath26 ) wires.@xcite while the characteristic scales @xmath27 and @xmath28 are discussed in detail below , we mention here that the condition @xmath29 defines a quasi - ballistic regime , in which a hole at the bottom of the band typically scatters at most once from excitations at the fermi level during its passage through the wire . on the other hand , the condition @xmath26 defines a homogeneous diffusive regime where the hole suffers from many collisions granting fully diffusive dynamics in momentum space on a scale set by temperature . in both cases",
    "the distribution function of the holes at the bottom of the band is space - independent .",
    "that is , one effectively deals with a homogeneous problem and consequently linear dependences @xmath30 are found .",
    "slopes , however , are parametrically different in the quasi - ballistic and homogenous diffusive regimes .",
    "one should therefore expect a nontrivial length dependence @xmath31 in the intermediate regime which at low temperatures of interest defines a wide region of length scales @xmath32 specified below . as we discuss next",
    ", this condition defines an _ inhomogeneous _ diffusive regime , in which the typical range of diffusive dynamics in momentum space is set by the length of the wire .",
    "this latter is addressed within an inhomogeneous fokker - planck equation .",
    "the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) describes the paradigmatic situation in which a heavy ` brownian ' particle propagates in a dilute gas of light particles .",
    "collisions between heavy and light particles then lead to a diffusive motion of the former . in our context , the typical momentum @xmath33 transferred in a collision between a hole at the band bottom and thermally excited electron - hole excitations ( plasmons ) is restricted due to fermi blocking to be of the order of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the velocity of excitations at the fermi level . below we consider the case in which the dispersion of a hole at the bottom of the band is quadratic , @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the effective mass of the hole .",
    "we then encounter the above situation at low enough temperatures where the typical momentum of the hole @xmath38 , see also fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    formally , we start out from the boltzmann equation @xmath39   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the hole distribution @xmath40 in a steady state @xmath41 . employing the small parameter @xmath42",
    "one may perform a kramers - moyal expansion and approximate the collision integral by the fokker - planck form @xmath43 \\simeq    - \\partial_p \\left (   a(p ) g_{p , x }   -   { 1\\over 2 } \\partial_p   [ b(p ) g_{p , x } ]   \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fokker - planck operator describes an interplay of drift and diffusion which sends the system into the new steady state .",
    "coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eq .   are model specific functions . in all cases of interest ,",
    "variation of the coefficient @xmath45 occurs on a momentum scale much larger than @xmath46 , and it may thus be approximated by a constant @xmath47 .",
    "employing common statistical mechanics arguments , we further know that in a homogeneous equilibrium situation , @xmath48 , the dilute hole at the band bottom is described by a boltzmann distribution .",
    "this fixes @xmath49 , and the ( dilute ) hole distribution thus follows the space - dependent fpe , also known as kramers equation  @xcite @xmath50 all microscopic details are stored in the single constant @xmath51 , which physically speaking has the meaning of a diffusion constant in momentum space .",
    "it can be explicitly calculated in the special cases of either weak or strong interactions .",
    "@xcite interestingly , one can also obtain a phenomenological expression for @xmath51 in terms of the spectrum of the mobile impurity ( hole ) in the luttinger liquid .",
    "@xcite inhomogeneity in eq .",
    "is induced by the boundary conditions taking into account the finite voltage bias . for a dilute hole at the band bottom",
    "the latter can be approximated by a classical boltzmann form    [ bc ] @xmath52    where @xmath0 is the bandwidth of the hole excitations , see eq .",
    "[ disp ] .",
    "while the above expressions and are obvious in the limit of weak interactions , let us notice that independent of the interaction strength the occupation of ( dilute ) high - energy excitations in a fluid at rest is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath53 , where @xmath15 the excitation spectrum .",
    "a finite voltage bias sets the fluid in motion and changes the excitation spectrum of the galilean invariant system in the stationary frame according to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fluid velocity expressed in terms of the electric current @xmath56 and the particle density @xmath57 . restricting then @xmath58 to the first brillouin zone and measuring momenta from the zone boundary we substitute @xmath59 , where for our purposes @xmath60 . substituting further particle density @xmath61 and current @xmath62 ,",
    "one arrives at the above boundary conditions .    using eq .",
    "one finds the backscattering rate in the fokker - planck approximation @xmath63 here @xmath64 affords the interpretation of the current of the holes in momentum space through the band bottom , resulting in the interaction - induced correction @xmath31 to the conductance of non - interacting electrons , see eq .  .",
    "before we start a detailed analysis of the kramers equation , it is instructive to obtain the characteristic scales of distance @xmath28 and momentum @xmath46 inherent to it . assuming that the expression in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fpeq ] ) is of the same order of magnitude as each of the terms in the right - hand side , we obtain @xmath65 the above conditions are satisfied for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the two scales can be understood as follows .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) for the hole distribution function are discontinuous at @xmath68 . in the presence of scattering in the wire , @xmath69 , the discontinuity smears .",
    "such smearing is weak in short wires , such that @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the typical momentum scale of the smeared distribution is small compared to @xmath46 , and grows with the length of the wire . in wires",
    "longer than @xmath28 the smearing reaches its final value @xmath46 dictated by the temperature of the system and mass of the holes , but not the scattering rate , see also fig .",
    "we start the detailed analysis of the kramers equation with boundary conditions with the study of the inhomogeneous diffusive regime @xmath70 .",
    "to quantify the above qualitative considerations let us return to kramers equation and restrict to short wires @xmath32 in the diffusive regime and small momenta , specified momentarily .",
    "we then observe that in this inhomogeneous diffusive regime the fokker - planck operator is dominated by the second derivative ` smearing'-operator , and thus a simplified analysis applies where drift is neglected , @xmath71 indeed , if the discontinuity of the hole distribution occurs on a scale @xmath72 in momentum space one may estimate @xmath73 . neglecting drift",
    "then amounts to dropping contributions @xmath74 much smaller than unity for small momenta @xmath75 of interest .",
    "@xcite    it is convenient to define the length scale @xmath76 and to introduce the dimensionless variables , @xmath77 in terms of which eq .   takes the form @xmath78 let us now insert the separation ansatz @xmath79 where the functions @xmath80 satisfy the differential equation @xmath81 then solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dimensionless_form ] ) in the linear response regime assume the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 the airy function . in obtaining eq .",
    "we took advantage of the fact that in the linear response regime the distribution in the center of the wire @xmath85 is antisymmetric in @xmath86 .",
    "finally , coefficients @xmath87 are fixed by imposing the boundary conditions , @xmath88 for a detailed discussion on this procedure we refer to appendix  [ app : ballistic ] and move on to the physical implications of our solution .",
    "our result for the backscattering rate at @xmath32 has the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a numerical coefficient defined through an integral equation and numerically found to be @xmath91 , as discussed in appendix  [ app : ballistic ] .",
    "the resulting power - law dependence @xmath92 in the wire length @xmath93 is a consequence of the scaling form of the kramers equation and can be understood as follows .",
    "@xcite    in combination with eq .",
    "the power - law scaling @xmath94 implies that the discontinuity at @xmath68 in the distribution of right - moving excitations broadens with the distance @xmath95 from the left lead as @xmath96 .",
    "this scaling ( and correspondingly for distribution of left - moving excitations with distance from the right lead ) reflects the diffusive nature of the backscattering processes .",
    "excitations entering e.g.  from the right lead with momentum @xmath97 , move to the left , gradually decrease their velocity in collisions , and eventually return to the right lead . in order to lose momentum of order @xmath97",
    "an excitation has to experience sufficiently many collisions in the wire , which requires a time @xmath98 determined from the standard diffusion condition @xmath99 . propagating through the wire at a typical velocity @xmath100 until the turning point",
    ", the excitation thus moves a distance @xmath101 from the lead . combining these two observations ,",
    "one obtains @xmath102 , and thus @xmath103 .",
    "finally , let us address the crossover from the inhomogeneous diffusive to the quasi - ballistic regime .",
    "the latter is characterized by a length of the wire shorter than the average length scale on which a hole at the bottom of the band scatters off low - energy excitations .",
    "this regime recently has been studied by lunde _",
    "et al._@xcite for weakly interacting electrons within a perturbative treatment of the boltzmann equation .",
    "this approach builds on the observation that , as the typical highly excited hole participates in at most one collision , backscattering occurs via a single collision and smearing of the hole distribution near @xmath104 can be neglected .",
    "of course , in this regime the picture of diffusive dynamics in momentum space underlying the fokker planck approximation does not apply .    to elaborate this point",
    "let us recall that the fokker - planck approximation relies on a gradient expansion of the collision integral .",
    "the latter applies if the typical momentum exchange @xmath105 in a collision is small compared to the momentum scale @xmath106 on which the distribution varies . applying this criterion",
    ", we find that the inhomogeneous diffusive regime is limited to length scales larger than @xmath107 .",
    "notice that @xmath108 and at low temperatures @xmath109 the result for the inhomogeneous diffusive regime thus applies within a broad region . at the crossover @xmath110 the characteristic scale @xmath111 , and",
    "the backscattering rate @xmath112 is thus independent of @xmath51 .    for weak interactions",
    "@xmath28 has been calculated from a microscopic theory .",
    "it was shown to be related to the typical time scale for a three - particle collision @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite building on this result we find that at weak interactions the limit of the inhomogeneous diffusive regime is set by @xmath115 .",
    "notice that @xmath116 is the velocity of a hole which can backscatter in a single three - particle collision with typical momentum exchange @xmath117 .",
    "we thus observe that in wires of length @xmath29 such hole will typically suffer at most one collision when traversing the wire , i.e. @xmath110 also defines the limit below which the quasi - ballistic regime of lunde _",
    "et al._@xcite applies .",
    "we thus expect that for @xmath29 the perturbative calculation of lunde _ et al .",
    "indeed , their result @xmath118 at @xmath110 matches eq .  .",
    "the linear scaling @xmath30 here simply reflects the fact that in the quasi - ballistic regime the probability of backscattering linearly increases with the time spent in the wire . as this linear dependence",
    "does not rely on the assumption of weak interactions , one can use eq .  ( [ nrtrans ] ) to extend the result by lunde _",
    "_ to arbitrary interaction strength , @xmath119 precise determination of the numerical prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ genlunde ] ) would require a more careful treatment .",
    "we next discuss how the result for the inhomogeneous diffusive regime @xmath120 crosses over into the homogeneous diffusive regime @xmath121 . to this end",
    "we need to address the full inhomogeneous fokker - planck equation subject to the boundary conditions .    following the procedure of the previous section we decompose the hole - distribution @xmath20 into a",
    "spatially homogeneous and an inhomogeneous part @xmath122 where the homogeneous part is readily found as  @xcite @xmath123e^{-\\delta / t}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the homogeneous distribution gives a contribution to the backscattering rate that scales linearly with the length of the wire and dominates at @xmath124 .",
    "to find the inhomogeneous solution we return to the dimensionless variables @xmath86 and @xmath125 in eq .   and start out from the ansatz @xmath126 this leads us to the differential equation for @xmath127 @xmath128 which for the special values of the parameter , @xmath129 and @xmath130 is solved by hermite polynomials with shifted arguments @xmath131 . using again that in the linear response regime @xmath132 is antisymmetric in @xmath86 and noting that @xmath133 , the general solution to reads @xmath134 where @xmath135 and we introduced the normalization constant @xmath136 .",
    "expansion coefficients @xmath137 are found from matching ansatz to the boundary conditions , @xmath138 and details of this calculation can be found in appendix  [ app : crossover ] .",
    "accounting then for homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the distribution function the backscattering rate reads @xmath139 where we introduced vector @xmath56 and matrices @xmath140 , @xmath141 , respectively , with coefficients @xmath142 and @xmath143 .    in the inhomogeneous diffusive regime @xmath144",
    "main contributions to eq .",
    "originate from coefficients with large index @xmath145 .",
    "this allows to approximate hermite polynomials in the eigenfunctions by airy functions according to  @xcite @xmath146 .",
    "reassuringly , upon this substitution one recovers eq .  .",
    "in the opposite limit @xmath147 one may approximate @xmath148 and thus finds the backscattering rate @xmath149 with an universal offset numerically calculated as @xmath150 .    to address the crossover regime at arbitrary ratios @xmath151 we numerically evaluated .",
    "the resulting backscattering rate leads to a finite temperature correction to the conductance shown in fig .",
    "we observe that the characteristic power - law @xmath94 of the inhomogeneous diffusive regime extends up to lengths of the wire @xmath152 .",
    "once the wire length exceeds @xmath153 , the correction follows the linear length dependence of the homogeneous diffusive regime with the universal off - set @xmath150 .",
    "these features hold for weak as well as strong interaction , and the peculiar power law dependence of @xmath154 on the wire length is , therefore , characteristic to short clean quantum wires @xmath155 .",
    "we have studied the interaction - induced backscattering rate @xmath156 in a voltage - biased clean quantum wire , in which conservation laws suppress relaxation .",
    "our calculations apply for wires in a broad range of lengths @xmath157 , which are short in the sense that equilibration has not fully established , but long enough to guarantee diffusive motion in momentum space due to interaction - induced collisions . in these wires ,",
    "a finite rate @xmath156 arises due to the backscattering of mobile holes at the band bottom performing the random motion of a brownian particle in momentum space while scattering from excitations at the fermi level .",
    "reminiscent to the first passage problem the dynamics of the hole is described by an inhomogeneous fokker - planck equation .    from solutions of the latter we have derived the wire length dependence of the interaction - induced correction to the conductance , and found a power law scaling @xmath158 as a characteristic feature of these wires .",
    "we have identified the length scale @xmath27 which separates the diffusive from the quasi - ballistic regime .",
    "the latter has previously been studied by lunde _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the limit of weak interactions .",
    "we confirmed that for weakly interacting electrons backscattering rates in both regimes match at the crossover scale @xmath159 , and were able to generalize the results by lunde _",
    "_ to arbitrary interaction strengths .",
    "our results hold for weakly as well as strongly interacting electrons .",
    "they depend on the interaction strength via the bandwidth of excitations @xmath0 , which sets the activation energy @xmath160 , and effective mass @xmath37 and diffusion constant @xmath51 , which both define the relevant length scale of the problem , @xmath28 .",
    "the activation behavior @xmath160 dominates the temperature dependence of the backscattering rate and corresponding correction to the conductance .",

    "the strongly interacting limit of a wigner crystal has been addressed recently .",
    "@xcite there , a scaling @xmath162 was found , and a similar result holds at arbitrary interaction strength .",
