    "dwarf galaxies are the most abundant galactic objects in the universe and play a key role in galaxy formation . because of their shallow gravitational potentials ,",
    "feedback from star formation is most efficient in these galaxies and is believed to successfully eject a large amount of their gas and metals ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) . as a consequence",
    ", dwarf galaxies may have a fundamental role in polluting the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm , hereafter ) with the products of stellar nucleosynthesis ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of galaxies and their gas content in the local universe indicate that feedback in the form of galactic winds plays an important role in regulating star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the impact of feedback is believed to be strongest in dwarfs .",
    "it is however important to note that feedback can be equally effective in temporarily reheating the interstellar medium and quenching star formation in more massive galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of observational data suggests that , for each unit of gas mass that is converted into stars , an equal or larger amount of interstellar gas can be reheated and ejected from the disk of a galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the ejected mass may be lost to the galaxy and deposited into the igm , this has a dramatic effect on the total amount of stars that can be formed in a galaxy during its lifetime .    by regulating star formation",
    ", feedback also alters the properties of the entire galaxy population .",
    "the shape of the luminosity function ( i.e. the space density of galaxies as a function of their luminosity ) is believed to reflect the effects of different feedback mechanisms .",
    "different studies have demonstrated that feedback by galactic winds is responsible for shaping the faint end of the luminosity function ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recent work has focused on feedback from accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn feedback , hereafter ) as an important physical mechanism to suppress the cooling flows in relatively massive haloes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while some of the gas ( and metals ) ejected by winds may fall back onto the galaxy at a later time via galactic fountains or gravitational accretion , a fraction of the ejected material may be deposited permanently into the igm .",
    "metals have been detected in the lowest density regions of the universe probed by the ly@xmath4  forest in the spectra of high  redshift quasars , and the igm metallicity has been estimated to be in the range @xmath5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although most of the intergalactic metals appear to be associated with galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a significant fraction does not show such a correlation @xcite .",
    "galaxies remain the best candidates to explain the enrichment of regions at larger overdensities , such as filaments , groups and clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as for the enrichment of the lowest density regions ,",
    "it is still not clear which is the contribution from the first populations of stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we implement a dynamical treatment of galactic winds in a galaxy formation model in order to test if this leads to any improvement on previous empirically  motivated feedback schemes used in semi",
    " analytic models .",
    "such a scheme introduces a further level of sophistication in the treatment of feedback . to this end , we use an updated version of the wind model of @xcite and the munich galaxy formation model used in @xcite ( dlb07 hereafter ) .",
    "our wind model entirely replaces the supernovae feedback scheme used in the semi - analytic model but it does not affect the agn feedback , which does not depend on star formation @xcite .",
    "we apply our model to the millennium simulation @xcite and we compare our model results to those from the latest millennium galaxy catalogue of dlb07 .    this paper is organised as follows . in section [ model ]",

    "finally , in section [ enrich ] we investigate the role of winds in recycling gas and metals , and in enriching the igm through the cosmic time .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section [ summary ] .",
    "in this work we use the millennium simulation to trace the evolution of dark matter haloes in a cubic box of 500 @xmath1mpc on a side @xcite . the underlying cosmological model is a @xmath6cdm cosmology consistent with a combined analysis of the 2dfgrs and first year wmap data @xcite .",

    "our wind scheme also contains free parameters , which we discuss in the following and summarise in table  [ params ] .",
    "the feedback model used here is based on the work by @xcite .",
    "galactic winds are treated as spherical blastwaves , powered by supernova explosions and stellar winds , which expand in a cosmological context .",
    "the physics of galactic winds is described by the equation of motion that governs their dynamical evolution .",
    "the main difference between this analysis and that of @xcite resides in the fully self - consistent treatment of feedback . while in @xcite winds",
    "are added `` on top '' of the semi ",
    "analytic prescriptions for galaxy formation , here we integrate the dynamic treatment of winds together with the existing prescriptions for star formation , chemical evolution and gas cooling .",
    "this results in a scheme",
    "in which the ejection and recycling of gas and metals is dictated by the dynamic evolution of the winds , rather than by phenomenological recipes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "motivated approach to feedback in semi ",
    "analytic models has recently been presented by @xcite .",
    "we describe the dynamical evolution of a wind as a two - stage process : a pressure  driven , adiabatic expansion , followed by a momentum  driven snowplough . during the first stage ,",
    "a spherical bubble of hot gas blows out the disk of a galaxy and a wind is formed .",
    "the expansion of the bubble is driven by the pressure of the outflowing gas and the equation of motion is expressed by the conservation of the bubble energy @xmath22 : @xmath23 \\left (      v_{\\textrm{s } } - v_{\\textrm{o } } \\right ) - v_{\\textrm{o } } p_{\\textrm{o } }      \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radius and the velocity of the shock , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the mass outflow rate and the outflow velocity of the wind at the shock radius ( see subsec .",
    "[ masses ] ) .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the density , the pressure , the internal energy and the outward velocity of the surrounding medium and @xmath32 the total mass internal to the shock radius .",
    "the term @xmath33 indicates the rate at which gravitational energy is transferred from the swept  up gas to the other components @xcite .",
    "the expansion of a wind is determined by the balance between the forces acting on the wind : the injection of energy and momentum from sn accelerates the expansion , while the combined effect of gravity , thermal pressure , and ram pressure slows it down and might eventually make the wind collapse .",
    "when radiative losses become dominant and most of the energy transferred to the swept  up gas is radiated away , the adiabatic stage is terminated and a thin shell of cooled gas forms near the outer edge of the bubble .",
    "this typically happens when the cooling time of the bubble becomes shorter than the age of the wind .",
    "when the snowplough stage sets in , the expansion of the shell is described by the conservation of the wind momentum : @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the mass of the shell .",
    "the only formal difference between these equations and those used in @xcite consists in the removal of the free parameter @xmath36 .",
    "this means that a wind expanding into a halo sweeps up all the hot gas it encounters on its path , instead of just a fraction of it .",
    "it is therefore equivalent to assuming @xmath37 . in our model winds",
    "are powered by all galaxies in a halo and effectively blow `` from haloes '' , receiving energy , momentum and mass from all the galaxies in the halo ( see sec .  [ ic ] ) . when haloes merge and a former central galaxy becomes a satellite , its wind is transferred to the central galaxy of the merged halo .",
    "if the central galaxy is already blowing a wind , the two are combined under the assumption that mass , energy and momentum are conserved .",
    "the mass and the metals ejected into the igm by the merged galaxies are added to the ejected component of the new central galaxy .",
    "if the momentum of the outflowing material is not able to balance the momentum losses by gravity and pressure forces , the wind can collapse and create a galactic fountain .",
    "the dynamics of the collapsing wind can be traced by eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) until the shell falls back onto the central galaxy .",
    "we assume that all the mass in the collapsed wind is instantaneously reincorporated into the hot component of the halo .",
    "in previous schemes @xcite the ejected material is reincorporated into the hot component , thereafter being again available for cooling , on a time ",
    "scale that is proportional to the dynamical time ",
    "scale of the halo .",
    "@xcite argue that various observational results can be reproduced only by models in which the ejected material is re - incorporated on a time - scale comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "if a large amount of energy and momentum is injected in a bubble , a wind can overcome gravity and pressure forces and expand to a large radius .",
    "when the wind reaches the hubble flow , it escapes from the halo and its mass and metals are lost for ever from the galaxy .",
    "we define the transition between the halo environment and the hubble flow as the point where the velocity of the surrounding medium , defined as @xmath38 , is dominated by the hubble flow term and becomes positive .",
    "here , @xmath39 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the escape velocity of the halo at radius @xmath24 , calculated assuming a nfw profile @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this assumption is that the maximum radius to which winds can travel is proportional to the virial mass of the halo .",
    "winds outflowing from small haloes escape at smaller radii than winds expanding out of larger haloes . in the following , we will call `` mass in igm '' the wind mass that reaches the hubble flow",
    ". this material can not be re - incorporated and therefore does not partecipate again in the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the evolution and exchange of metals between the different galactic components follows the same scheme proposed in @xcite , modified to integrate self - consistently the removal of gas and metals from the cold gas .",
    "when stars form , metals are produced and instantaneously returned to the interstellar medium .",
    "subsequently , they can be deposited into the hot gas and ejected component by feedback processes .    during the adiabatic stage",
    ", the outflowing mass creates the over - pressurized bubble of hot gas .",
    "the mass of the bubble @xmath42 is determined by the conservation of mass law : @xmath43 where the first term on the right hand side represents the mass of cold gas reheated by sn explosions and stellar winds and the second term defines the amount of hot gas swept up by the wind and accreted during the expansion in the halo . in a snowplough ,",
    "most of the mass accumulates in a thin shell of mass @xmath35 : @xmath44 a fraction @xmath45 of the outflowing ism does not reach the shell and remains in the cavity behind the shock . assuming that the amount of metals exchanged is proportional to the corresponding amount of mass ( i.e. neglecting any metal - loading effect ) , the corresponding equations for metals are : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the metallicity of the cold gas and @xmath48 the metallicity of the hot gas , and : @xmath49 a fraction @xmath50 of the outflowing metals remains in the cavity behind the shell .",
    "[ mass_e][mass_zshell ] imply that the amount of mass and metals ejected from the cold gas are @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively . in our model , we assume that supernova ejecta efficiently mix with the ism before leaving the disk of the galaxy , as done in @xcite .",
    "the amount of mass and metals removed from the halo hot gas and swept up on to a wind are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the removal of hot gas from the halo is in principle similar to the implementation of the `` ejected mass '' in the @xcite model , but here it is justified on the basis of the dynamical evolution of the winds and their sweeping up the gas on the path of the expansion .",
    "observations of galaxies in the local and high redshift universe suggest that the mass loss rate of winds is roughly proportional to the star formation rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is predicted by the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "only a weak dependence of the mass loss rate on the virial velocity of haloes is instead observed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our model , we parametrise the mass loss rate @xmath26 as a function of the star formation rate @xmath55 and of the virial velocity of the halo @xmath56 : @xmath57 in the above equation , @xmath26 represents the sum of the star formation rates of all the galaxies in a halo .",
    "the power law index @xmath58 and the constant wind mass loss rate @xmath59 are free parameters . according to this choice , all galaxies in a halo contribute to power the corresponding wind and to eject mass and metals .",
    "the dependence of the wind mass loss rate on the halo virial velocity @xmath60 implies that the ratio @xmath61 is highest in the smallest haloes .",

    "since winds are multiphase phenomena , the detection of the outflowing gas in different wavebands gives information about wind gas components at different temperatures .",
    "these may yield very diverse values for the wind velocity .",
    "the x  ray emitting gas is believed to represent the most energetic phase of the wind , containing most of the metal  rich supernova ejecta .",
    "simulations by @xcite demonstrate that this gas is outflowing with the highest velocities , but it is not representative of the bulk of the mass in winds .",

    "most winds start blowing with such a little initial energy , compared to the energy required to overcome the gravitational and pressure forces of the halo , that they collapse within a few time  steps .",
    "the role of these winds is important in regulating the star formation history of the central galaxies , because they determine the removal of the material reheated by supernovae explosions and its deposition into the hot halo gas .",
    "we assume that winds escape haloes when they reach the hubble flow .",

    "[ cumwinds ] also suggests that , while at @xmath3 most of the metals in the igm are not gravitationally bound to haloes , at @xmath126 most metals are still in the process of being ejected by winds and have not yet reached the hubble flow .",

    "[ gasout ] and [ metalsout ] , haloes with @xmath124 @xmath1m@xmath2 can transfer up to 25% of their mass into a wind , before this is incorporated into the hot gas .",
    "this is an artifact of our feedback scheme .",
    "when a wind attempts to blow out of a massive halo , its initial velocity and the halo central gas density are high ; this means that a much larger mass is accreted onto the wind from the halo gas than from the material outflowing from the star  forming galaxies .",
    "this effect becomes stronger with increasing halo mass , hence the trend of increasing ejection efficiency for @xmath124 @xmath1m@xmath2 .",
    "since winds in massive haloes always collapse after a few timesteps , this feature simply describes the deposition of mass and metals into the hot cluster gas .",
    "the mass and metals ejected by haloes with @xmath124 @xmath1m@xmath2 are therefore not relevant for the global mass and metal budget .",
    "this demonstrates to what extent our feedback scheme is different from that of dlb07 .",
    "this mass transfer does not require an intermediate stage in the dlb07 model ( see @xcite for details ) . in dlb07 ,",
    "the hot gas is ejected only if the energy transferred to the hot gas by supernova explosions is larger than the increase of the thermal energy of the halo due to the deposition of the reheated mass .",
    "since this never happens in haloes with @xmath88 @xmath1m@xmath2 , the hot gas is never removed from the halo .",
    "hence the difference in the amount of gas being recycled in these haloes in the two models .",
    "the different treatment of feedback in haloes with @xmath124 @xmath1m@xmath2 also explains why the model of dlb07 produces only red galaxies at the highest stellar masses , while our model still predicts a few blue , late type galaxies ( fig . [ fracs ] ) .",
    "the continuous recycling of gas in groups with @xmath130 @xmath1m@xmath2 may favour the cooling of gas onto the central galaxies , which may accrete a sufficient amount of gas to form a disk .    to verify that our findings are genuine and",
    "do not critically depend on the speficic values of the model parameters , we modify the power law index @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ massloss ] ) and ( [ windspeed ] ) and we consider models with @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( for consistency , the value of the wind initial velocity @xmath68 is also adjusted to keep the total wind energy roughly constant ) .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath58 , the less mass is lost by smaller galaxies and the larger the mass injected in winds by larger galaxies . however , we find that no matter the value of @xmath58 , haloes with @xmath0 @xmath1m@xmath2 are always the most efficient to deposit metals into the igm , while larger haloes do not lose more than a few percent of their metals .",
    "this confirms that the dynamical feedback scheme we present here describes the evolution of galactic winds and their effects on galaxies , independently of the actual values of the model parameters .",
    "in this work , we have presented a new feedback scheme which is based on a dynamical treatment of the evolution of galactic winds in a cosmological context .",
    "the scheme has been incorporated in the munich semi  analytic model for galaxy formation described in @xcite and @xcite and replaces previous implementations of supernova feedback , but does not alter the agn feedback model . in our scheme , the ejection and recycling of gas and metals are treated self ",
    "consistently and are governed by the dynamical evolution of winds , rather than by empirical prescriptions .",
    "our model contains a number of assumptions , as we have discussed above .",
    "these are : i ) winds are described as spherically symmetric blastwaves , as in @xcite .",
    "ii ) the dynamics of winds is described as a two - stage process , e.g. a pressure  driven , adiabatic stage , followed by a momentum  driven snowplough .",
    "an intermediate pressure  driven snowplough stage is not included in our treatment of winds .",
    "iii ) winds sweep up all the gas they encounter along their path .",
    "this situation corresponds to an entrainment fraction parameter @xmath133 in the model of @xcite .",
    "iv ) winds are linearly added together when haloes merge , without being destroyed in the process .",
    "v ) when winds collapse , the wind mass is instantaneously reincorporated into the hot halo gas .",
    "vi ) we do not track the injection of energy into the hot halo gas when winds collapse and their mass is reincorporated into the halo hot gas .",
    "vii ) when winds reach the hubble flow , their mass is permanently deposited into the igm .",
    "viii ) winds are powered by the star formation taking place in all galaxies in the halo , including satellites .",
    "ix ) the wind mass loss rate @xmath26 and the wind initial velocity @xmath65 are described by eqs .",
    "[ massloss ] and [ windspeed ] , respectively .",
    "our results demonstrate that our dynamical scheme is a good alternative to empirical recipes for feedback and in particular it is able to reproduce the observed properties of dwarf galaxies with higher accuracy than previous models .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the predictions for the the k  band and @xmath84band luminosity functions and for the stellar mass function are in good agreement with observations .",
    "in particular , the number density of dwarfs is reproduced with greater accuracy than in the model presented in dlb07 .",
    "2 .   the stellar mass  stellar metallicity and the luminosity  gas metallicity relationships are in good agreement with observations and",
    "significantly improve previous results .",
    "again , the improvement is significant for dwarf galaxies .",
    "these results demonstrate that in our model the treatment of feedback in dwarf galaxies is significantly improved with respect to previous implementations .",
    "we argue that the main reason for this improvement is the possibility of estimating the amount of mass and metals that a halo can permanently lose and deposit into the igm .",
    "this feature determines a stronger quenching of star formation in small haloes and therefore the suppression of the faint end of the stellar mass and luminosity functions of galaxies , and the shape of the mass  stellar metallicity and of the luminosity  gas metallicity relationships .",
    "our model , however , also exhibits some weaknesses .",
    "firstly , there is a tendency to overestimate the number of bright galaxies in the lfs , because of the continuous recycling of gas when winds recollapse in massive haloes .",
    "a possible solution could be an increase in the efficiency of agn feedback ( about 2030 per cent more intense than suggested by @xcite ) , but this would negatively affect the abundance of galaxies at the knee of the lfs . our model does not solve the problem of the abundance of @xmath90 galaxies at @xmath3 , which continues to be underestimated ( see also @xcite ) . finally , perhaps the most severe shortcoming of the model is that it does not correctly reproduce the colour distribution of galaxies . in particular , our model results do not exhibit the sharp colour bimodality observed for galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this feature does not depend on the specific values of the model parameters and it can be alleviated only by assuming very inefficient feedback .",
    "however , models with inefficient feedback do not correctly reproduce the abundance of dwarf galaxies , nor their metallicities .",
    "in the second part of our paper , we have investigated the efficiency of the mass and metal injection in winds and their deposition into the igm .",
    "we have shown that in our model , galaxies in haloes with @xmath134 @xmath1m@xmath2 are responsible for most of the metal enrichment of the igm , being the only objects that can blow winds out of their gravitational potentials .",
    "larger haloes like groups and clusters lose only a small fraction of their mass and metals , and this occurs before most of the halo mass is accreted .",
    "our feedback model contains the same number of free parameters ( i.e. 3 ) as the supernova feedback scheme of @xcite , once the dependence of the ejected mass on the halo virial velocity in @xcite , which corresponds to our parameter @xmath58 , is taken into account .",
    "the numerical calculation of the evolution of winds is only slightly more time ",
    "consuming than previous feedback schemes .",
