    "in order to facilitate comparison with previous results , we employ the same model and computational method as in ref .",
    "specifically , we perform kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations of a two - dimensional periodic square lattice of ising spins @xmath14 , which can take only the values @xmath15 the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ferromagnetic exchange interaction , @xmath18 runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs , @xmath19 runs over all @xmath20 lattice sites , and @xmath21 is an oscillating , spatially uniform applied magnetic field .",

    "other symmetric field shapes , such as sinusoidal @xcite and sawtooth @xcite , yield essentially the same results , but with a larger critical period and with stronger finite - size effects .",

    "all simulations were performed at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the equilibrium critical temperature of the square - lattice ising ferromagnet in zero applied field @xcite .",
    "the system responds to the oscillating field via the time - dependent magnetization per site , @xmath29 the dynamic order parameter is defined as the average of @xmath30 over a given field cycle @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath32 we define the bias field , so named because it measures the shift ( or ` bias ' ) of the periodic field toward either negative or positive field values , as the period - averaged magnetic field , @xmath33 this definition applies generally to any periodic magnetic field @xmath21 . in this paper ,",
    "the applied field consists of a square wave with period @xmath23 superposed with a constant magnetic field . applying ( [ bias.def ] ) ,",
    "since the period - average of the square - wave field is zero , the bias field @xmath1 in this case is simply equal to the superposed constant magnetic field .",
    "in the two - dimensional equilibrium ising model , the critical isotherm is given ( in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , as @xmath34 as @xmath35 where the critical exponent @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for finite systems , this relationship breaks down when the infinite - system correlation length , @xmath37 , which diverges as @xmath38 , becomes comparable to the linear system size @xmath11 .",
    "the relationship also naturally breaks down at larger fields away from the critical region .",
    "therefore , a plot of @xmath39 vs @xmath40 for a given system size @xmath11 will follow the power law ( [ equ.powerlaw ] ) for a range of @xmath40 near the critical value @xmath41 , with this range extending to smaller @xmath40 as @xmath11 is increased @xcite .",

    "was found to greatly reduce the statistical significance of the fit , the value @xmath53 serves as a boundary of the scaling region at @xmath44 .",
    "this result is consistent with an exponent @xmath54 , suggesting that the bias field @xmath1 , for these parameters and the square waveform , is the dominant component of a conjugate field which exhibits the same scaling exponent in the dpt as does the applied magnetic field in the equilibrium ising transition .",
    "to provide more complete evidence that @xmath1 is the dominant component of the field conjugate to @xmath43 , in the next several sections we will demonstrate data collapse onto a two - parameter finite - size scaling function for the system - size dependent quantity @xmath55 at points @xmath56 , for lattice sizes @xmath11 = 90 , 128 , 180 , and ( in several cases ) @xmath50 , using the critical exponents for the equilibrium ising system . in this section ,",
    "we briefly review the theory of finite - size scaling as it applies to this system .",
    "we then determine the expected asymptotic forms of the scaling functions , which are compared in later sections of the paper to our computational data .",

    "further differentiation yields the susceptibility , @xmath68 where the exponent for @xmath11 in the prefactor is obtained by using the exponent equality @xmath69 .",
    "it has previously been shown analytically that the dpt for a sinusoidal applied field , which is symmetric under @xmath70 and so which can safely be assumed to have @xmath71 , has an effective ginzburg - landau free - energy density in the same universality class as the equilibrium ising model @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears reasonable to write corresponding scaling functions for the dynamic order parameter @xmath43 and its associated susceptibility @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the ( as yet unknown ) field conjugate to @xmath43 . in this paper",

    "[ eq : qscale ] and [ eq : chihatscale ] is dimensionless .",
    "the specific form , @xmath78 , with which @xmath76 is assumed to enter the second scaling parameter needs more theoretical investigation , and could conceivably change as the theory of the dpt is further developed .",
    "however , this should not affect our conclusions @xcite .",
    "computational results for sinusoidal and square - wave fields , which both are symmetric under @xmath70 and so presumably have @xmath79 , have previously confirmed the scaling behavior with respect to @xmath80 .",
