    "the experiment ( depicted in fig . [ expsetup ] ) was performed with a source of hyperentangled photons and a detection module ( alice ) located at the institute for quantum optics and quantum information ( iqoqi ) and a receiver station ( bob ) at the university of natural resources and life sciences ( boku ) in vienna .",
    "the source of hyperentangled photons was based on type-0 spdc in a periodically poled ktiopo@xmath0 ( ppktp ) crystal .",
    "the ppktp crystal was bi - directionally pumped inside a polarization sagnac interferometer @xcite and generated polarization - entangled signal and idler photons with center wavelengths @xmath1{nm}$ ] and @xmath2{nm}$ ] .",
    "the signal and idler photons were separated using a dichroic mirror and coupled into optical single - mode fibers .",
    "the quasi - phase matching condition in the 20-mm - long ppktp crystal @xcite resulted in a spectral bandwidth of @xmath3{nm}$ ] , which corresponds to a two - photon coherence time of @xmath4{ps}$ ] .",
    "the emission time of a signal and idler pair is uncertain within the significantly longer coherence time of the 405-nm pump laser ( @xmath5{ns}$ ] ) , such that the bi - photon state is in a superposition of possible pair - emission times , i.e. entangled in the energy - time dof @xcite .",
    "the signal and idler photons were thus in a hyperentangled state in polarization and energy - time :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent horizontally and vertically polarized photon states , @xmath9 denotes photon - pair emission times , and the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 label the respective single - mode fiber for alice and bob . for the sake of brevity",
    "we have assumed a cw pump laser with infinite coherence time and perfectly correlated photon pair emissions . for a detailed discussion of the energy - time state in spdc , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "photon @xmath10 was guided to a local measurement module and photon @xmath11 was guided to a transmitter telescope on the roof of the institute via a 15-m - long single - mode fiber .",
    "the photons emanating from the transmitter telescope were overlapped with an additional beacon laser ( @xmath12{nm}$ ] ) for pointing , acquisition , and tracking ( pat ) and sent to a receiver telescope at boku via a 1.2-km - long optical free - space link .",
    "the receiver telescope consisted of a telephoto objective ( nikkor @xmath13{mm}$ ] f/2.8 ) and an additional collimation lens .",
    "note that the same telephoto objective is currently installed in the iss cupola module , and was recently proposed as a receiver in a quantum uplink scenario @xcite .",
    "the beacon laser was transmitted through a dichroic mirror and focused at a ccd while the collimated single - photon beam was guided to bob s measurement module .",
    "the measurement modules for alice and bob each featured a polarization analyzer and an optional transfer setup that coupled the energy - time dof to the polarization dof .",
    "alice s polarization analyzer consisted of a half - wave plate , a variable phase shifter , and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) with multi - mode fiber - coupled single - photon avalanche diodes ( spad ) in each of its two output ports .",
    "a variable phase shift @xmath14 could be introduced between the computational basis states @xmath15 by tilting a birefringent yvo@xmath0 crystal by an angle @xmath16 about its optical axis using a stepper motor . with the half - wave plate set to",
    "this configuration corresponds to a polarization measurement in a superposition basis @xmath17 / -@xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "bob s polarization analyzer module used a motorized half - wave plate and a pbs with a spad ( active area of @xmath20{\\mu m}$ ] ) in each of its two output ports . in order to reduce background counts from the city ,",
    "long pass filters and interference filters were added and the optical system was engineered such that the detectors had a small field of view ( @xmath21{\\mu rad}$ ] ) .",
    "bob s analysis setup allowed for measurements in any linear polarization basis , in particular the basis + 45/-45 , where @xmath22 .    for the analysis of energy - time entanglement we employed a variant of the original franson interferometer @xcite , that uses polarization - dependent delays to map an energy - time subspace spanned by early @xmath23 and late @xmath24 pair emissions to the polarization state space @xcite .",
    "this variant has the advantage that the polarization entanglement acts as a pair of synchronized switches , such that there is no need for detection post selection @xcite .",
    "these unbalanced polarization interferometers at alice and bob were implemented with 3-mm - long calcite crystals , which could be inserted before the polarization analyzers .",
    "the calcite crystal introduced a birefringent delay of @xmath25{ps}$ ] , which exceeded the coherence time of the spdc photons but was significantly shorter than the coherence time of the pump laser .",
    "hence , after the polarization - dependent delay , polarization measurements in a superposition basis correspond to measurements of energy - time entangled states of the form @xmath26 .",
    "note that the particular choice of delay introduced in the unbalanced polarization interferometer restricts our considerations to a two - dimensional subspace of the intrinsically continuous - variable energy - time space , which could be fully exploited , e.g. , in experimental implementations with a variable delay line @xcite .",
    "the arrival times of single - photon detection events at alice and bob were recorded relative to local 10 mhz gps - disciplined clocks and stored on local hard drives for post - processing of two - photon detection events .",
    "bob s measurement data was also streamed to alice via an rf link where all combinations of two - photon detection events within a coincidence window of were monitored on - the - fly , while compensating for relative clock drifts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : link - rate ] ) @xcite .",
    "directly after the source s single - mode fibers we measured a total coincidence rate of @xmath27{kcps}$ ] and singles rates of @xmath28{kcps}$ ] , and @xmath29{kcps}$ ] ( pump power @xmath30{\\mu w}$ ] ) .",
    "of the single photons sent via the free - space link we measured an average of @xmath31{kcps}$ ] in bob s two detector channels , and an average rate of @xmath32{kcps}$ ] two - photon detection events per second . due to atmospheric turbulence",
    "the link transmission varied on the time - scale of ms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : link - rate ] ) .",
    "the time - averaged link transmission was determined to be approximately 18% .",
    "besides being used for pat , the ccd also monitored angle of arrival fluctuations caused by atmospheric turbulence @xcite .",
    "the full width half maximum of the angular variation at the telescope was estimated with a series of short exposure images and was in the order of @xmath33{\\mu rad}$ ] .",
    "this corresponds to an atmospheric fried parameter of approximately @xmath25{cm}$ ] which is similar to that experienced in an free - space link over 144 km on the canary islands @xcite and represents a worst case scenario in a satellite communication experiment though the atmosphere .",
    "note that the angle of arrival fluctuations were significantly smaller than the detector s field of view ; the fluctuation of detected count rates visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : link - rate ] stem from beam wander at the aperture of the receiver telescope .    for night - time operation",
    "the background counts were approximately @xmath34{cps}$ ] and @xmath35{cps}$ ] for bob s two detector channels , whereby @xmath36{cps}$ ] and @xmath37{cps}$ ] were due to intrinsic detector dark counts .",
    "in order to verify the integrity of the atmospheric quantum communication channel for hyperentangled photons , we first assessed experimental polarization correlations , while scanning the phase of alice s measurement basis @xmath17/@xmath38 and keeping bob s measurement setup in the linear + 45/-45polarization basis .",
    "the experimental two - photon correlation functions were calculated as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 denotes the number of recorded coincidence detections between alice and bob s spad detectors ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the fringe visibility @xmath8 was extracted from a least - mean - square fit to the expected two - photon correlation in presence of experimental imperfections :    @xmath42    where @xmath14 is the phase shift as a function of the phase plate s tilt angle @xmath16 and @xmath43 is an additional phase offset introduced by the calcite crystals . the experimental polarization correlation function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - scan ] ) exhibited interference fringes with a visibility of @xmath44 .",
    "the correlation in the linear @xmath45 measurement basis remained at a constant value of @xmath46 , irrespective of @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , with the transfer setup inserted in both measurement modules , we observed franson interference with a fringe visibility of @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - scan ] ) . in order to verify that the interference in the energy - time dof was indeed due to two - photon coherence , and not single - photon energy - time coherence of the signal and idler photons independently , we removed the transfer setup in bob s detection module . in this case",
    "the measurement outcomes were completely uncorrelated , irrespective of @xmath14 , since the polarization - dependent delay exceeded the coherence time of the spdc photons .",
    "this is indicated by the straight line in fig .",

    "a. ) average single - photon ( blue line ) and two - photon ( red line ) detection rate ( 100ms integration time ) after 1.2-km - long free - space transmission .",
    "the short - term signal fluctuated due to atmospheric turbulence , whereas the time - averaged rate of approximately 20 kcps remained almost constant over several hours .",
    "b. ) relative clock drift between alice and bob .",
    "the inset depicts the normalized histogram of two - photon detection events in time bins centered around the flight - time offset of @xmath48{\\mu s}$ ] .",

    "almost no interference was observed when the energy - time to polarization transfer setup was introduced in alice s detection module only ( yellow line , @xmath50 ) . ]",
    "we have distributed hyperentangled photon pairs via an intra - city free - space link under conditions of strong atmospheric turbulence . in a series of experiments we independently observed two - photon interference with visibilities of @xmath51 in the @xmath52-dimensional polarization state space and @xmath53 in a @xmath52-dimensional energy - time subspace .",
    "the observation of high - visibility interference for both dof is a clear sign for the presence of hyperentanglement and implies a violation of corresponding bell inequalities .",
    "while the transmission of polarization - entangled photons has been studied in a number of previous field trials , our results demonstrate the feasibility of also exploiting time - energy / polarization hyperentanglement in real - world link conditions with strong atmospheric turbulence . despite the severe wave front distortions we achieved a high two - photon detection rate of @xmath32{kcps}$ ] over a link distance of .",
    "our analysis of interference in the energy - time dof relies on a polarization interferometer that coherently couples the polarization space with a 2-dimensional energy - time subspace , which is also required for the implementation of single - photon two - qubit operations .",
    "critically , this can be exploited in e.g. hyperentanglement - assisted bell state measurements and more efficient entanglement purification schemes @xcite .",
    "however , in order to fully benefit from hyperentanglement for such applications will require resolving the delay of photons in free - space compatible time - bin analyzers , as recently demonstrated in refs.@xcite .",
    "the coherent transmission of quantum information embedded in a genuine high - dimensional state space under real - world link conditions represents an important step towards long - distance quantum communications with more complex quantum systems and could play a key role in the implementation of advanced quantum information processing protocols in the future . a large quantum state space not only allows for larger information capacity in quantum communication links , as well as devising quantum communication schemes with more resilience against noise and improved security against eavesdroppers , but also allows for more diverse types of non - classical correlations which could prove vital in addressing technological challenges on the path towards global - scale quantum networks , as well as fundamental physics experiments .",
    "since polarization - entangled photon sources based on spdc quite naturally exhibit energy - time entanglement when pumped with a continuous wave pump laser , the approach can readily be implemented with existing sources and proposals for satellite - link experiments with polarization - entangled photons without need for additional critical hardware @xcite .",
    "the additional possibility of analyzing energy - time entanglement could provide a platform for entirely new fundamental physics experiments with long - distance satellite links , such as the evaluation of models for gravity - induced wave function collapse or quantum information processing in a relativistic framework .",
    "high - dimensional energy - time entangled states can also be considered as a natural candidate for applications in quantum - enhanced clock synchronization protocols @xcite , and could allow for significant gains in performance by employing other quantum features , such as non - local cancellation of dispersion @xcite .",
    "we also believe that our results will motivate both further theoretical research into energy - time entanglement experiments conceivable at relativistic scenarios with satellite links , as well as experimental research into the exploitation of hyperentanglement in long - distance quantum communications .",
