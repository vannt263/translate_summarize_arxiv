    "one of the great hopes for current and future particle colliders is that they will be able to produce dark matter . in this study , we determine the prospects for finding dark matter through the production of exotic 4th generation quarks @xmath0 that decay through @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is dark matter .",
    "current direct and indirect bounds on such exotic quarks restrict their mass range to @xmath10 .",
    "our analysis is valid for all dark matter masses up to @xmath11 , although there are special reasons to be interested in very light @xmath2 particles , with @xmath12 .    there are both general and specific dark matter motivations for this signal .",
    "starting with the general motivation , one of the few things that is absolutely certain about dark matter is that it must be long - lived on cosmological time scales .",
    "this is typically achieved by giving dark matter a charge under an unbroken discrete or continuous symmetry , which makes it absolutely stable .",
    "none of the unbroken symmetries of the standard model ( sm ) will do for this purpose , so the dark matter particle must be charged under a new unbroken symmetry .",
    "there are then two options .",
    "the dark matter , with its stabilizing `` dark charge , '' may have only gravitational interactions with the sm . in this case",
    ", dark matter may have interesting astrophysical signals  @xcite , but it can not be discovered at colliders .    alternatively , the dark matter may be coupled to sm particles @xmath13 through connector particles @xmath14 that have both dark and sm charges to make @xmath15 couplings possible .",
    "@xmath2 may or may not have sm weak interactions . however , @xmath14 necessarily has sm charge .",
    "it can therefore be produced at colliders , and so dark matter can be discovered through @xmath14 production followed by @xmath16 .",
    "since the energy frontier is dominated by hadron colliders for the foreseeable future , the most promising case is where @xmath14 is strongly interacting .",
    "supersymmetric ( universal extra dimension ) models provide a concrete example of this , where the dark matter is neutralinos  @xcite ( kaluza - klein ( kk ) gauge bosons  @xcite ) , the connector particles are squarks ( kk quarks ) , and the stabilizing symmetry is @xmath17-parity ( kk - parity ) . here",
    "we consider the case where the dark matter has no sm gauge interactions , the connector particles are exotic quarks , and the stabilizing symmetry may be either discrete or continuous  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that with minor modifications , our analysis applies much more generally , both to the supersymmetric and extra dimensional scenarios just mentioned , as well as to many other dark matter scenarios motivated by the general chain of reasoning given above .",
    "these scenarios also have a more speculative , but at the same time more specific and tantalizing , dark matter motivation .",
    "the dama experiment sees an 8.9@xmath6 signal in the annual modulation of scattering rates that can potentially be explained by dark matter  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties from both astrophysics  @xcite and detector response  @xcite open the possibility that dama can be explained without conflicting with other experiments by a light dark matter particle with mass @xmath18 elastically scattering off nucleons with spin - independent cross section @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this explanation is supported by unexplained events recently reported by the cogent collaboration  @xcite , which , if interpreted as a dark matter signal , are best fit by dark matter with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the low mass and high cross sections preferred by dama and cogent are consistent with the recent bounds and results from cdms  @xcite .",
    "such large cross sections are several orders of magnitude larger than those of typical weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "as we review below , however , they are easily obtained if the dark matter particle scatters through @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an exotic 4th generation quark .",
    "furthermore , this scenario naturally emerges in wimpless dark matter models , where dark matter not only can have the correct @xmath24 and @xmath25 for dama and cogent , but also naturally has the correct thermal relic density  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is a special case of the general framework described above , and , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , particularly motivates the case where dark matter couples to third generation quarks and the @xmath2 particles are light .",
    "given all of these motivations , we explore here the detection prospects for exotic 4th generation quarks decaying directly to dark matter .",
    "this signal differs from most supersymmetry searches , which typically assume that decays to dark matter are dominated by cascade decays .",
    "the 4th generation quarks examined here also differ from the 4th generation quarks that are typically studied , because they are charged under a new symmetry under which sm particles are neutral .",
    "this forbids decays to sm quarks , such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are the basis for most standard 4th generation quark searches .",
    "instead , all @xmath23 decays must necessarily produce hidden sector particles charged under the new symmetry , with the lightest such particle being @xmath2 , the dark matter .",
    "this leads to the signal of @xmath28 , which has previously not been considered in searches for 4th generation quarks .",
    "in addition , as emphasized earlier , this type of signals appear in a general set of dark matter motivated models , as well as other new physics scenarios , such as little higgs models with @xmath29-parity conservation  @xcite and models in which baryon and lepton number are gauge symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the results of our analyses can be easily applied to these other models .",
    "we will find that @xmath0 pair production followed by @xmath30 leads to @xmath31 signals that may be discovered at the tevatron with @xmath32 of integrated luminosity , or at the lhc with integrated luminosities of as little as @xmath33 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we detail the dark matter motivations and define the model we explore . in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] we summarize the current theoretical and experimental constraints on exotic 4th generation quarks .",
    "we then describe the details of our signal and background simulations and cut analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discovery ] we present the prospects for discovering or excluding these exotic 4th generation quark scenarios with tevatron and early lhc data .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of future prospects in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as discussed above , in this work we consider the case where dark matter has a charge under some new symmetry , but no sm gauge interactions .",
    "this dark matter is therefore not a typical wimp , but it may nevertheless naturally appear in theories motivated by the gauge hierarchy problem and have the correct thermal relic density .",
    "this is the case for wimpless dark matter models  @xcite , supersymmetric models where the effects of a supersymmetry - breaking sector are transmitted to both the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) sector and a hidden sector through gauge - mediation .",
    "the hidden sector superpartner mass scale is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hidden sector gauge coupling , @xmath36 is the supersymmetry - breaking scale squared , and @xmath37 is the mass scale of the messenger particles . because the mssm superpartner masses are also generated by gauge - mediation from the same susy - breaking sector , we find @xmath38 the ratio @xmath39 sets the annihilation cross section of a particle through gauge interactions , which in turn determines the thermal relic density of a stable particle  @xcite .",
    "the `` wimp miracle '' is the remarkable coincidence that , for a stable wimp with mass @xmath40 and coupling @xmath41 , this thermal relic density is roughly that required by astrophysical observations .",
    "equation  ( [ thermalsigmascaling ] ) shows that our hidden sector candidate automatically has approximately the same annihilation cross section , and thus the same relic density .",
    "if there are connectors @xmath14 with both dark and sm charge , wimpless dark matter may have observable interactions through couplings @xmath15 , where @xmath13 are sm particles .",
    "in this case , wimpless dark matter has many of the virtues and implications commonly associated with wimps .",
    "in contrast to wimps , however , the wimpless dark matter s mass need not be at the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "it may be treated as a free parameter , which in turn determines the gauge coupling strength of the hidden sector .",
    "this freedom opens new possibilities for dark matter model parameters and new experimental search windows .",
    "the dama dark matter signal of annual modulation in direct detection has motivated a variety of explanations  @xcite .",
    "the canonical possibility , where wimp dark matter with mass @xmath42 elastically scatters , is excluded , as the required scattering cross section is in conflict with other experiments .",
    "inelastic scattering  @xcite , in which dark matter is assumed to scatter to another state that is @xmath43 heavier , has also been explored .",
    "such scattering alleviates the conflict between different direct detection experiments , but is tightly constrained by neutrino bounds on dark matter annihilation in the sun  @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is elastic scattering of a light dark matter particle with @xmath44 and large spin - independent nucleon scattering cross section @xmath19  @xcite , a region also supported by recent results from cogent  @xcite .",
    "such explanations are possible if the dama signal is enhanced by populations of dark matter in tidal streams  @xcite or detection thresholds are lowered by channeling  @xcite , and may also require an unusual background spectrum for consistency  @xcite . in typical wimp models ,",
    "the required small masses and large cross sections are possible  @xcite , but not at all generic .",
    "in contrast , wimpless dark matter provides a natural setting for the low mass explanation . in the example presented in refs .",

    "the @xmath23 have hidden parity and are in the sm su(3)@xmath52su(2)@xmath52u(1)@xmath53 representations @xmath54 the subscripts @xmath55 and @xmath17 refer to su(2 ) doublets and singlets , respectively , not chirality ; the chirality of the @xmath56 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 fields is opposite to their sm counterparts , and they are therefore mirror quarks .",
    "finally , the @xmath23 receive mass through electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the couplings of eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) imply scattering through @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "this induces a coupling to the gluons of the nucleon at one - loop  @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath12 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , the coupling to @xmath61 quarks produces a cross section @xmath25 in the right range to explain dama and cogent . for example , the best fit point for the cogent data can be obtained with @xmath20 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the large cross section can be understood as follows : spin - independent scattering requires a chirality flip on the fermion line , which is typically suppressed by a small yukawa coupling .",
    "but if the dark matter is a scalar , than a mass insertion on the @xmath23 propagator provides the necessary chirality flip without suppressing @xmath25 , since the @xmath23 are heavy and their yukawa couplings are large .",
    "the explanation therefore requires that @xmath2 is a scalar and the connectors are chiral fermions .",
    "in fact , this mechanism is overly efficient . if the 3rd generation quarks are replaced by 1st generation quarks in eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) , the dark matter couples to nucleons at tree - level , and the desired @xmath25 is achieved for couplings @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "this is also perfectly acceptable and worth studying  @xcite , but the required coupling for @xmath61 quarks appears to be somewhat more natural and , in the general case where there are couplings to more than one generation , less constrained by flavor - changing neutral currents . in this study",
    ", we assume negligible couplings to 1st and 2nd generation quarks and focus on the collider phenomenology of the case where the @xmath23 decay directly to 3rd generation quarks .",
    "if the dark matter is stabilized not by a discrete symmetry , but by a continuous symmetry , @xmath56 and @xmath65 must have opposite dark charges to allow them to get a mass .",
    "the yukawa couplings of eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) must therefore be generalized to @xmath66 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are two complex scalars with opposite dark charges . in general , @xmath67 and @xmath69 will mix to form mass eigenstates @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the lighter state is the dark matter particle and can couple to both @xmath56 and @xmath65 .",
    "despite slight additional complications , we therefore recover the discrete symmetry case , although there may now be additional decays @xmath72 . for simplicity , we focus in the rest of this study on the discrete symmetry case with couplings given in eq .",
    "( [ couplings ] ) .",
    "as with sm quarks , the 4th generation quarks receive their mass through electroweak symmetry breaking , and so @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "perturbativity places an upper bound on @xmath75 ; requiring @xmath76 implies @xmath77 .",
    "4th generation quark masses are also constrained by precision electroweak data .",
    "these constraints are not modified by the exotic and mirror features of the quarks we consider , and they imply @xmath78 , where some non - degeneracy is required  @xcite .",
    "4th generation quarks may also have many beneficial effects , for example , raising the higgs boson mass in supersymmetric theories through their loop corrections , and enhancing higgs boson production rates  @xcite .",
    "direct searches place lower bounds on @xmath75 .",
    "these searches are rather independent of the details of the couplings to the hidden sector . @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath79 production is dominated by qcd processes .",
    "in addition , the coupling @xmath80 only affects the @xmath0 and @xmath79 lifetimes . for all but extremely small @xmath80 , the @xmath0 and @xmath79 decay promptly .    with the model framework and assumptions given in sec .  [",

    "@xmath79 pair production followed by @xmath82 leads to a signature of @xmath89 , which is identical to the final state of bottom squark pair production followed by @xmath90 .",

    "taking into account the difference in @xmath96 and @xmath97 cross sections , the dresults imply @xmath98 .",

    "it is hard , however , to apply their results to the @xmath109 signal , since no @xmath61-tagging is used in that analysis .    in our analysis",
    ", we will focus on @xmath0 pair production , @xmath110 , with the distinctive , but more complicated , final state of a top quark pair plus missing energy from the @xmath2 particles .",
    "the cdf collaboration has reported a search for the analogous supersymmetric process of top squark pair production based on an integrated luminosity of @xmath111 , using the purely leptonic final states from @xmath112 , followed by @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "the data are consistent with the sm , leading to the constraint @xmath114 , where the exact limit depends on @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "similar signals also appear in other new physics scenarios such as little higgs models with @xmath29-parity  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath118 signature at the lhc in the semi - leptonic channel has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , that study focused on higher masses with larger integrated luminosity",
    ". the hadronic mode has been analyzed at the parton level in ref .",
    "@xcite , focusing on the prospects for spin determination and mass measurements .",
    "in contrast , our study is performed at the detector level and is focused on the exclusion and discovery potential of both the tevatron and early lhc data .",
    "to investigate the discovery and exclusion prospects , we have simulated production and decay of the new particles at the tevatron and at the lhc with @xmath119 , as well as the main backgrounds .",
    "all simulations have been done using madgraph / madevent - pythia 6.4.20 - pgs4  @xcite with the @xmath120-ordered pythia showers and the cdf or atlas detector cards for pgs4 .",
    "matrix element / parton shower matching has been applied both for signal and backgrounds , and its validity has been double - checked by comparing different maximum multiplicity samples .",
    "the parton distribution function set used is cteq6l1 , and factorization and renormalization scales are set to @xmath121 for the centrally - produced particle pair .",
    "we do not apply @xmath122-factors for higher order qcd effects to either signal or background .",
    "these @xmath122-factors are expected to enhance these cross sections and be similar for the signal and top pair production ( the dominant background after cuts ) , and hence the effect of including them would only be to increase the signal significance . in addition",
    ", there are uncertainties in the cross sections of both signal and backgrounds due to parton distribution functions @xcite .    for @xmath123 , the @xmath0 can not decay to an on - shell @xmath124 .",
    "these parameter points have therefore been simulated in madgraph / madevent using off - shell top decay , @xmath125 .",

    "the signatures of @xmath127 are determined by the decays of the top quark pair and can therefore be divided into hadronic , semi - leptonic and purely leptonic channels . since the @xmath0 decays will always generate missing transverse momentum from the invisible @xmath2 particles in the final state , the most relevant backgrounds are those with significant missing energy from @xmath128 or @xmath129 boson decays into neutrinos .",
    "we will focus on the semi - leptonic and hadronic channels .",
    "the dilepton channel has suppressed cross section because of the small leptonic decay branching ratios .",
    "the semi - leptonic decay has the advantage that the presence of an isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) makes it easier to suppress qcd backgrounds , while for the fully hadronic channel this requires additional @xmath126 cuts .",
    "this is particularly important for early running of the lhc , where the missing energy resolution might not yet be fully under control . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadronic decay mode has larger branching ratio .",
    "moreover , the main backgrounds , @xmath130 and @xmath131 production , only have substantial @xmath31 in association with leptons ; in fact , the only truly irreducible background to the fully hadronic decay mode is @xmath132 + jets ( and the negligible @xmath133 background ) .      to distinguish signal from background in the semi - leptonic case , we look for large @xmath31 and large transverse mass of the leptonic @xmath128 candidate , defined to be @xmath134 for the background is mainly from @xmath128 decay , we expect @xmath135 for most of the background , while much of the signal extends beyond this limit . for the background surviving the @xmath31 and transverse mass cuts , we expect a significant fraction to be due to decays of the second top into hadronic @xmath136 leptons and missing energy .",
    "we therefore expect fewer jets for the background than for the signal . to further suppress the background , we also require the presence of a second , hadronically - decaying @xmath128 .    to implement this strategy ,",
    "we employ the following precuts ( differences between the tevatron and the lhc are noted where they apply ) :    * one isolated electron or muon with @xmath137 . * no additional isolated leptons with @xmath138 . *",

    "we have focused on the up - type 4th generation quark @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 pair production leads to @xmath198 , and we have then analyzed the semi - leptonic and fully hadronic channels .",
    "the fully hadronic channel ( vetoing events with leptons ) seems to be the most efficient , because of the large branching fraction and the reduction in sm background with large @xmath31 .",
    "existing constraints require @xmath199 , where the lower bound comes from direct searches , and the upper bound is from perturbativity .",
    "we have found that there are bright prospects for probing exotic 4th generation quarks in this mass window at the tevatron and in early data from the lhc . for models with @xmath200 ,",
    "the discovery of new physics is possible at the tevatron with @xmath201 of luminosity , while for @xmath195 the discovery of new physics may be possible at the lhc with @xmath202 . in particular , with @xmath203 of data , the lhc should be able to discover almost all of the relevant parameter space with @xmath204 , where wimpless models can explain the dama and cogent results .",
    "conversely , if no signal is seen in @xmath9 , the entire mass range consistent with current bounds and perturbativity will be excluded .    of course , although an exclusion definitively excludes the model , a discovery will only be a discovery of a multi - jet ( + lepton ) + @xmath31 signal .",
    "considerably larger integrated luminosity would be needed to identify the signal as @xmath118 , and it is an even harder problem to determine if the new physics really is @xmath205 production , with decay to top quarks and dark matter . such a discovery analysis would require a good identification of the decaying top quarks as well as spin and mass determinations of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles , and would require significant amounts of data from the lhc ( and be beyond the capabilities of the tevatron ) .",
    "exotic 4th generation quark decays are not the only processes that give a signal of top quark pairs plus missing transverse energy . in particular , this is a typical signature for supersymmetry , for example , from stop pair production followed by the decay @xmath206 .",
    "however , it should be possible to distinguish these possibilities with more lhc data . since the 4th generation quark is a fermion",
    ", it has a higher production cross - section than squarks with a similar mass .",
    "moreover , squarks could also have more complicated decay chains that would be absent in @xmath0 decay",
    ". there have already been studies on how to distinguish supersymmetric signals from other new physics with similar signals  @xcite , and it would be worthwhile to perform a more detailed analysis of how one would distinguish exotic 4th generation quarks from squarks .",
    "it is also worth noting that the process @xmath207 + jets would be well suited for analysis using the @xmath208 kinematic variable  @xcite .",
    "this analysis has focused on pair production of the up - type 4th generation quarks @xmath0 .",
    "precision electroweak constraints imply that the down - type 4th generation quark @xmath79 must be fairly degenerate with the @xmath0 , and so @xmath209 should also be accessible .",
    "this will likely be a more difficult signal to extract from early data , since it requires a good understanding of @xmath61-tagging , and we would expect large qcd backgrounds .",
    "but in the event of a discovery , such an analysis will be immensely useful in understanding the underlying physics .",
    "there is also an interesting complementarity between the collider studies of dark matter considered here , and direct or indirect detection strategies .",
    "for example , one may consider wimpless dark matter models in the limit of small @xmath80 .",
    "in this limit the cross - sections for dark matter - nucleon scattering and for dark matter annihilation are small , and direct or indirect dark matter searches will be unsuccessful . but the production cross section for @xmath210 pairs is controlled by qcd , independent of the yukawa coupling @xmath80 .",
    "so for models in this limit of parameter space , hadron colliders may provide the only direct evidence for the nature of dark matter .",
    "interestingly , at small @xmath80 , the 4th generation quarks are long - lived .",
    "this may result in displaced decay vertices , and a sufficiently long - lived 4th generation quark may even hadronize and reach the detector",
    ". there has already been significant study of detection strategies for long - lived exotic hadrons  @xcite , and these results should be directly applicable to the case when the @xmath0 travels a macroscopic distance in the detector",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate further how to determine the nature of such semi - stable color triplet particles .",
    "our results for a 10 tev lhc run can be approximately translated to the alternative of an extended 7 tev run . in this case",
    ", a coverage corresponding to the @xmath9 quoted in this study should be attainable for less than about @xmath211",
    ".    finally , and of particular interest , the annual modulation signal of dama  @xcite has been recently supported by unexplained events from cogent  @xcite , which , if interpreted as dark matter , also favor the same low mass @xmath212 and high cross section @xmath213 region of dark matter parameter space .",
    "these results are consistent with recent bounds and results from cdms  @xcite .",
    "the consistency of several direct detection experiments is , of course , important to establish a dark matter signal .",
    "improved statistics will be essential , but given the difficulty of making definitive background determinations , independent confirmation by completely different means is also highly desirable . as discussed above ,",
    "the direct detection data may naturally be explained by scalar dark matter interacting with exotic 4th generation quarks .",
    "data already taken by the super - kamiokande experiment provide a promising probe of these interpretations of dama , cdms , and cogent through indirect detection  @xcite .",
    "the results derived here show that these explanations , including wimpless models , can also be tested very directly with data already taken at the tevatron and have extraordinarily promising implications for early runs of the lhc .",

    "<S> we determine the prospects for finding dark matter at the tevatron and lhc through the production of exotic 4th generation quarks @xmath0 that decay through @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting signal of @xmath3 has not previously been considered in searches for 4th generation quarks , but there are both general and specific dark matter motivations for this signal , and with slight modifications , this analysis applies to any scenario where invisible particles are produced in association with top quarks . </S>",
    "<S> current direct and indirect bounds on such exotic quarks restrict their masses to be between 300 and 600 gev , and the dark matter s mass may be anywhere below @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the signal and main backgrounds with madgraph / madevent - pythia - pgs4 . for the tevatron , we find that an integrated luminosity of @xmath5 will allow 3@xmath6 discovery up to @xmath7 and 95% exclusion up to @xmath8 . for the 10 tev lhc with @xmath9 , the discovery and exclusion sensitivities rise to 490 gev and 600 gev . </S>",
    "<S> these scenarios are therefore among the most promising for dark matter at colliders . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps most interestingly , we find that dark matter models that can explain results from the dama , cdms and cogent collaborations can be tested with high statistical significance using data already collected at the tevatron and have extraordinarily promising implications for early runs of the lhc . </S>"
