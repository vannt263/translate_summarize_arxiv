    "the theoretical expression for the angular two - point correlation function @xmath3 can be derived from its spatial counterpart @xmath4 by projection via the relativistic limber equation ( peebles 1980 ) :   @xmath5 ^ 2 } , \\label{eq : limber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the comoving radial coordinate , @xmath7 ( for a flat universe and in the small angle approximation ) , and @xmath8 is the number of objects within the shell ( @xmath9 ) . + the mass - mass correlation function @xmath10 to be inserted in eq.([eq : limber ] ) has been obtained following the work by @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , which provides an analytical way to derive the trend of @xmath10 both in the linear and non - linear regime . note that @xmath10 _ only _ depends on the underlying cosmology , which we fix by adopting @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a cobe - normalized value of @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant properties of scuba galaxies are included in the redshift distribution of sources @xmath8 , and in the bias factor @xmath15 .",
    "the effective bias factor @xmath16 of all the dark matter haloes with masses greater than some threshold @xmath17 is then obtained by integrating the quantity @xmath18 ( whose expression has been taken from @xcite ) - representing the bias of individual haloes of mass @xmath19 - opportunely weighted by the number density @xmath20 of scuba sources : @xmath21 note that , as @xmath22 can be thought as the fraction of haloes hosting a galaxy in the process of forming stars , its expression can also be written as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass spectrum of haloes with masses between @xmath19 and @xmath25 ( @xcite ) , @xmath26 is the duration of the star - formation burst and @xmath27 is the life - time of the haloes in which these objects reside ( see @xcite ) .    according to @xcite , sources showing up in the scuba counts can be broadly divided into three categories : low - mass ( masses in the range @xmath28 , duration of the star formation burst @xmath29  gyr , and typical fluxes @xmath30  mjy ) , intermediate - mass ( @xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath33  gyr ) and high - mass ( @xmath34 , @xmath35  gyr , dominating the counts at fluxes @xmath36  mjy ) .",
    "note that by @xmath37 we denote the mass in stars at completion of the star formation process .",
    "+ in order to evaluate the bias factor in eq.([eq : bias ] ) we then consider two extreme cases for the ratio between the mass in stars and the mass of the host dark halo : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . @xmath40 roughly corresponds to the ratio @xmath41 between total and baryon density , where we adopted for the latter quantity the standard value from primordial nucleosynthesis ; this corresponds to having assumed all the baryons to be locked into stars and , as a consequence , has to be considered as a conservative lower limit .",
    "@xmath38 is instead related to @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the present mass density in visible stars : the likely value is expected to be @xmath44  % .",
    "armed with the above results we can then evaluate the two - point correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : limber ] ) for different @xmath45 ratios and different flux cuts .",
    "figure 1 presents our predictions for @xmath3 , respectively for a flux cut of 50 ( solid line ) , 10 ( dashed line ) and 1 ( dotted line ) mjy . higher curves of each kind correspond to the case @xmath38 , while lower curves refer to @xmath40 . +",
    "the highest clustering amplitude is found for the brightest sources ( @xmath46  mjy ) .",
    "this is because they are associated to the most massive dark halos and are therefore highly biased tracers of the dark matter distribution .",
    "in addition , according to @xcite , they have a rather narrow redshift distribution so that the dilution of the clustering signal is minimum .",
    "the very sharp drop of all the curves at @xmath47 is due to the absence of nearby objects .",
    "this reflects the notion that the actively star - forming phase in spheroids is completed at @xmath48 .",
    "+ note that , since the clustering amplitude strongly depends on the quantity @xmath45 , measurements of the angular correlation function @xmath3 are in principle able to discriminate amongst different models of scuba galaxies and in particular to determine both their star - formation rate , via the amount of baryonic mass actively partaking the process of star formation , and the duration of the star - formation burst .    a first attempt to measure the angular correlation function of @xmath49  mjy scuba sources has been recently presented by @xcite .",
    "although such measurements are dominated by noise due to small - number statistics , it is nevertheless interesting to note that  as illustrated by the left - hand panel of figure 2  our model ( with a preference for the @xmath38 case ) shows full consistency with the data ( kindly provided by s. scott ) .    another possible way to obtain some information on the nature of scuba sources via their clustering properties",
    "is provided by the predictions of @xcite for lyman - break galaxies to be the low- to intermediate - mass tail of primeval spheroidal galaxies , with @xmath50  gyr and a star - formation rate ranging from a few to a hundred @xmath51 . in figure 2",
    "( right - hand panel ) we then plotted the predicted @xmath3 for those sources with @xmath52  mjy ( corresponding to @xmath53 ) , expected to be found within the redshift range @xmath54 , covered by the original ( steidel et al . , 1996 ) sample . as in the former case ,",
    "the higher curve is for @xmath38 , the lower one for @xmath40 .",
    "the data points show the @xcite measurements . even though large errors once again affect the observational findings",
    ", it is nevertheless clear that the predicted trend for @xmath3 can correctly reproduce the data for high ( @xmath55 ) values of the @xmath2 ratio .",
    "this result is consistent with the predictions by @xcite and implies a well defined relationship between scuba galaxies and lbgs .",
    "furthermore , it also confirms the expectations for a small fraction ( on the order of a few percent ) of the total mass to be confined into stars .",
    "finally , it is also worth noticing that our predictions are in agreement with the strong clustering of eros recently detected by @xcite , since we expect ( @xcite ) these objects to be the direct descendants of scuba galaxies , and therefore to exhibit the same clustering properties .",
    "an issue intimately connected with the analysis of galaxy clustering is the study of the contribution of unresolved sources ( i.e. sources with fluxes fainter than some detection limit @xmath56 ) to the background intensity .",
    "its general expression is given by : @xmath57 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath58 denotes the differential number counts , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively the maximum and minimum local luminosity of the sources , @xmath61 is the k - correction , @xmath62 is the redshift when the sources begin to shine , @xmath63 is the redshift at which a source of luminosity @xmath64 is seen with a flux equal to the detection limit @xmath56 , @xmath65 is the luminosity function ( i.e. the comoving number density of sources per unit @xmath66 ) , and @xmath6 is the comoving radial coordinate .",
    "the intensity fluctuation @xmath67 due to inhomogeneities in the space distribution of unresolved sources is then given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) , with the quantity @xmath65 replaced by @xmath68 .",
    "it is easily shown that the angular correlation of such intensity fluctuations @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 define two positions on the sky separated by an angle @xmath72 , can be expressed as the sum of two terms @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the first one due to poisson noise ( i.e. fluctuations given by randomly distributed objects ) , and the second one owing to source clustering .",
    "it is possible to show ( @xcite ) that , in the case of highly clustered sources , the poissonian term @xmath73 is negligible with respect to the one due to clustering . in the following we therefore only concentrate on temperature fluctuations caused by the @xmath74 term ( hereafter simply called @xmath75 ) .    by making use of the quantities",
    "previously defined and of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i ] ) , the clustering term @xmath75 takes the form : @xmath76 where the effective volume emissivity @xmath77 is expressed as : @xmath78}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",
    "\\phi(l , z)\\ ; k(l , z)\\ ; l\\;d{\\rm log}l \\label{eq : jeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] .",
    "@xmath79 in eq.([eq : cth ] ) has been evaluated separately for the three cases of low- , intermediate- and high - mass objects , by plugging in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeff ] ) the appropriate expressions for the luminosity function . the total contribution of clustering to intensity fluctuations",
    "has then been derived by adding up all the values of @xmath79 obtained for the different mass intervals and by also taking into account the cross - correlation terms between objects of different masses , according to the expression @xmath80 where the indexes @xmath81,@xmath82 stand for high , intermediate and low masses .",
    "+ note that , the quantity @xmath83 in eq.([eq : cth ] ) should indeed be read as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the maximum halo mass corresponding to the maximum visible bulge mass ( i.e. upper limit for the mass locked into stars ) , which corresponds in eq.([eq : bias ] ) to a replacement in the upper limit of the integrals of @xmath86 with @xmath85 .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations can then be obtained via ( see @xcite ) : @xmath87 ^ 2{\\rm exp}\\left(- \\frac{h\\nu}{k_b t}\\right)/\\left(\\frac{h\\nu}{k_b t } \\right)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which relates intensity and temperature fluctuations .",
    "figure [ fig : dt ] shows the predicted values for the quantity @xmath88 ( in units of k ) at respectively 353 ghz ( @xmath89 m  left - hand panel ) and 545 ghz ( @xmath90 m  right - hand panel )  the central frequencies of two of the channels of the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) of the esa s planck mission  as a function of the multipole @xmath91 up to @xmath92 .",
    "results are plotted for two different values of the source detection limit ( @xmath93 and 10  mjy for the 353 ghz case and @xmath94 and 45  mjy for the 545 ghz case ) and the usual two values of @xmath2 .",
    "also shown , for comparison , is the power spectrum of primary ( cmb ) anisotropies ( solid line ) predicted for the cosmology specified in the caption , computed with the cmbfast code developed by @xcite .    at @xmath89",
    "m , our model predicts fluctuations of amplitude due to clustering comparable to ( and possibly even larger than ) those obtained for primary cmb anisotropies at @xmath95 .",
    "this is because most of the clustering signal comes from massive galaxies with fluxes @xmath96  mjy , which lie at substantial redshifts and are therefore highly biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "also the strongly negative k - correction increases their contribution to the effective volume emissivity [ eq .  ( [ eq : jeff ] ) ] and therefore to the fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath90 m case is even more striking , since the contribution from clustering is expected to be more than an order of magnitude greater than the one originating from primordial fluctuations , regardless of the flux detection limit .",
    "+ this implies that important information on the clustering properties of faint sub - mm galaxies ( and hence on physical properties such as their mass and/or the amount of baryons involved in the star - formation process ) will reside in the planck maps at frequencies greater than 353 ghz where , however , the dominant signal is expected to come from interstellar dust emission . in order to show this effect , in figure 3",
    "we have also plotted the expected contribution from galactic dust emission averaged all over the sky ( upper dashed - dotted curves ) .",
    "this was derived from the iras maps at @xmath97 m , rescaled at the frequencies under exam by assuming a grey - body spectrum with @xmath98  k. as already anticipated , this signal appears to be the dominant one in both the 353 and 545 ghz planck channels . nevertheless , it is still possible to extract information on the nature of sub - mm galaxies if one restricts the analysis to high galactic latitude regions ( i.e. @xmath99 , lower dashed - dotted curves in figure 3 ) , which are the least affected by galactic dust emission . in fact , as it can be seen from figure 3 , the dust contribution in this region becomes less important than the one due to the clustering of unresolved sources for @xmath100 .",
