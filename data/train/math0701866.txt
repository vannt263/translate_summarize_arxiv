    "then for any choice of @xmath568 such that @xmath569 for each @xmath31 and @xmath551 we get a formula for the integral the @xmath570-th power of a linear form over @xmath19 @xmath571    notice that although each term in the sum has poles , the poles cancel and the sum is an analytic function of @xmath572 . since the @xmath570th - powers of linear forms generate the whole vector spaces of polynomials one obtains , from theorem [ main ] , a formula of integration for the polynomial functions over @xmath2 ( or for that matter , for any integral polytope for which we understand their cone decomposition ) .    the next application to the computation of ehrhart polynomials of faces of @xmath2 .",
    "one can easily obtain from theorem [ main ] similar formulas for the nonnegative integral semi - magic squares with structural zeros or forbidden entries ( i.e. fixed entries are equal zero ) . note that any face @xmath573 of @xmath2 , being the intersection of finitely many facets , is determine uniquely by the set of entries forced to take the value zero . to obtain a generating function for the dilations of a face @xmath573 of @xmath2 , @xmath574 , we start from our formula for @xmath575 in theorem [ main ] .",
    "for those variables @xmath576 mandated to be zero , we select a vector @xmath258 with entries @xmath577 so that the substitution @xmath578 does not create a singularity ( this @xmath258 exists e.g. , by taking random values from the positive orthant ) . call @xmath579 the result of doing this substitution on @xmath512",
    ". we will eventually set @xmath580 , but first , let us check that will not give any singularities . on the numerator @xmath459 can only appear with a nonnegative exponent .",
    "it can potentially create a singularity if it appears in a factor of the denominator with negative exponent .",
    "but , if this occurs , @xmath459 can be factored out and put with a positive exponent in the numerator .",
    "thus , we can safely resolve the singularity .",
    "now , we set @xmath580 in @xmath579 , those terms that had a power of @xmath459 in the numerator disappear .",
    "we obtain a multivariate sum of rational functions that gives us only the desired lattice points inside @xmath581 .",
    "we have now two examples of this method",
    ". first we apply it to obtain a table with the ehrhart polynomials for a ( any ) facet of @xmath582 .",
    "@xmath583    with the same method we have also computed , for the first time , the ehrhart polynomials for the chan - robbins - yen polytope @xmath584,@xmath585,@xmath586,@xmath587 , and @xmath588 ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath589    we conclude with some remarks .",
    "first , it is natural to ask whether one can derive our volume formula from a perturbation of the birkhoff polytope and then applying lawrence s formula for simple polytopes @xcite .",
    "we found such a proof using a perturbation suggested by b. sturmfels , but the proof presented here yields more results , for example , corollaries [ twoells ] and [ eqsigma ] can only be obtained this way .",
    "second , it is well known that brion s and lawrence s formulas can be proved from the properties of characteristic functions of polyhedra under polarity ( see e.g. corollary 2.8 in @xcite or theorem 3.2 @xcite ) . on the other hand p. filliman",
    "@xcite expressed the characteristic function any convex polytope @xmath19 containing the origin as an alternating sum of simplices that share supporting hyperplanes with @xmath19 .",
    "the terms in the alternating sum are given by a triangulation of the polar polytope of @xmath19 .",
    "filliman s machinery yields in a limiting case lawrence s volume formulas .",
    "different choices of triangulation of the polar of @xmath19 yield different volume formulas for @xmath19 .",
    "using filliman s duality g. kuperberg found ( unpublished ) other special volume formulas that follow from pulling triangulations of the dual of @xmath2 .",
    "we are truly grateful to richard p. stanley for his encouragement and support .",
    "in fact it is because prof .",
    "stanley that this project started , after he alerted us that there was a really nice pattern in the data presented in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "we are also grateful to bernd sturmfels and gnter ziegler for useful conversations that eventually led us to discover the combinatorial statement proved in theorem [ main ] .",
