    "this configuration is unstable in a type ii superconductor , and a minimal separation between vortices would result in a repulsive force .",
    "an interaction force decreasing and going to zero for very small vortex separation is in agreement with previous variational calculations of the interaction energy between vortices obtained by jacobs and rebbi in ref . .",
    "as we can see in fig .",

    "[ forcvsx0 ] , we fix the distance @xmath156 between two vortices and calculate the variation of the interaction force between them as a function of the distance @xmath134 to the surface . in this case , the contribution of the image vortices becomes more important as the pair approaches the surface .",
    "we show the interaction force parallel to the surface ( along the line that connects both vortices ) as a function of @xmath134 for @xmath2 in fig . [ forcvsx0](a ) and for @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ forcvsx0](b ) . in fig .",
    "[ forcvsx0](a ) , the open squares are for @xmath170 and the closed squares are for @xmath171 ; in both cases , we observe a steady decrease in the force between vortices when the distance to the surface decreases .",
    "there is only a small difference between the forces obtained at different values of the applied magnetic field due to the differences between the meissner currents induced in each case .",
    "the overall qualitative behavior is independent of the value of the distance between vortices @xmath156 , as we see in fig .",
    "[ forcvsx0](a ) by comparing the results for @xmath172 and @xmath173 . in fig .",
    "[ forcvsx0](b ) , the same qualitative behavior is observed for @xmath157 . from fig .",
    "[ forcvsx0 ] , we can conclude that there is a steady decrease in the interaction force between vortices when the distance to the surface decreases and that the force goes to zero when the pair is close to the boundary .",
    "this result can be understood by considering that the repulsive interaction force between two vortices is screened by the contribution of the attractive interaction force between each vortex with the image of the other vortex .",
    "in particular , when @xmath174 , a vortex and its image are located at approximately the same position for the other vortex and the interaction force goes to zero .",
    "our results suggest that the vortex lattice is softer in the direction parallel to the surface in finite samples",
    ". it should be interesting to devise experiments that can explore these properties .",
    "even when we have calculated the case of a semi - infinite sample , the same qualitative behavior is expected to appear in a thin film with vortices parallel to the surface . in a thin film ,",
    "vortices are confined by two surfaces and the image vortices corresponding to both surfaces contribute to the screening of the vortex interaction forces .     as a function of their distance to the surface @xmath134 . in ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", we compare results obtained at different values of @xmath0 , @xmath156 , and applied magnetic field @xmath93 . ]",
    "we have shown that clem s variational ansatz for a free vortex can be extended to the description of vortex penetration .",
    "the results show quite good agreement with the full numerical results both for the energy barrier and for the description of the vortex near the surface .",
    "the flux carried by a vortex as a function of its distance to the surface can be shown to be easily calculated and to coincide with known results .",
    "we extended the model to calculate the force between two vortices .",
    "when the vortices are far from the surface , the variational results show good agreement with the london and long - range gl results for large intervortex distances ; whereas for small distances , the variational model gives vanishing forces corresponding to the merging of the two vortices in a double quantized vortex @xcite .",
    "we also found a steady decrease in the interaction force between vortices when the distance to the surface decreases ; the interaction force goes to zero when the pair is close to the boundary .",
    "our variational approach gives manageable expressions that can be used to obtain approximations for all physically relevant quantities .",
    "another advantage of this method is the lower computational time that it requires , allowing one to obtain fast and reliable solutions for a vortex near a surface .",
    "the agreement between the variational solution and numerical calculations shows the usefulness of the former for intermediate @xmath0 when computations become heavy . for large @xmath0",
    ", numerical calculations can be based on the london model for the magnetic contribution .",
    "this description is not accurate at lower @xmath0 values where a numerical approach to the gl description is more appropriate .",
    "a particular problem arises at intermediate @xmath0 , at which the computation within the gl model becomes very demanding because of the difficulty to describe both spatial scales with the same discretization .",
    "it is in this range that the variational approach is most welcome .",
    "the method used in this paper can be generalized for mesoscopic superconductors . however , consideration of more than one surface in some cases could give rise to infinite images .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by truncating the infinite series as was done in ref . for vortex penetration in a thin film using the london model . in this paper",
    ", we have assumed a semi - infinite medium with no demagnetizing effects . in this case",
    ", the boundary condition for the magnetic field @xmath26 applies at the sample surface .",
    "a similar condition applies for a thin film with the externally applied magnetic field parallel to the surface .",
    "a thin film is an example of a mesoscopic system wherein our results can be generalized in a straightforward manner .",
    "however , in general , demagnetization effects are important in mesoscopic superconductors of finite thickness where the boundary condition @xmath26 applies at infinity and not at the sample boundary",
    ". vortices in mesoscopic superconductors are confined by the sample surface and their interaction with the meissner currents is very important , a situation with similarities to the case analyzed in this work .",
    "this opens up interesting questions about the behavior of the effective interaction force between two vortex cores as a function of the distance to the surface in mesoscopic superconductors .",
