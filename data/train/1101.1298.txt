    "the simulation follows the progression of the sn material as it expands and releases the energy deposited by the shock .",
    "figure [ f : bol ] shows our fits to sn1987a and sn2000cb . for both sne",
    "we reproduce the time scales and approximate maximum in the light curves . included in the simulation",
    "is a calculation of the deposition of energy from the decay of radioactive @xmath3ni .",
    "one of the model parameters used to fit the light curve is the mixing of the radioactive material within the ejecta . the more extensive the ni mixing , the sooner the effects of the heating will be observed . for sn2000cb",
    ", we find it necessary to mix the @xmath3ni uniformly out to @xmath94 of the ejecta .",
    "this allows an early heating of the material and subsequent earlier peak in the light curve .",
    "in addition , since the code does not take into account nonthermal opacity sources , an opacity floor is used to simulate continued opacity due to nonthermal ionization . the effect on the opacity of the large mass of @xmath3ni and its substantial mixing is emulated by a higher opacity floor . in our model for sn1987a , more substantial mixing would help smooth the sharp peak in the luminosity .",
    "fitting the velocity of the fe lines in sn2000cb requires an explosion energy of almost twice that of sn1987a . as a consequence of the fast expansion ,",
    "the debris becomes thinner faster , so a larger ejected mass of @xmath95 is necessary to harness the radioactive heating .",
    "this is 10% higher than our fit to sn1987a .",
    "the radii and temperatures we obtain are qualitatively consistent with the blackbody fits to the photometry except at early times , where the temperature from the model is significantly too high  similar to sn1999em but unlike what we measure for these very red sne .",
    "the basic input parameters for sn1987a are @xmath96b , @xmath97 cm , and @xmath98 . for",
    "we find @xmath99b , @xmath100 cm , and @xmath101 . here",
    "again we find that  had a relatively small initial radius consistent with a bsg , a significant explosion energy ( although not as high as derived from the scaling above ) , and a substantial amount of @xmath64 . it seems plausible that the relatively high @xmath64  yield of sn2000cb is related to its higher explosion energy , consistent with the correlation proposed by @xcite .    while there is typically some degeneracy between the energy and envelope mass derived for sne ( as we can often constrain only their ratio )",
    ", we find for  that both the mass and energy were substantial .",
    "the massive ejecta are required in order to trap the gamma rays emitted by the decaying @xmath64 .",
    "a smaller envelope would entail more escape , pushing our @xmath64  mass estimates even higher .",
    "a possibility which we have not taken into consideration is that asymmetry in the explosion and ejecta may have played a significant role for this object .",
    "this would require extensive modeling and is beyond the scope of this paper ; moreover , we would also need to explain why most sneii do not have such bizarre properties or any sign of significant asphericity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while a few possible identifications have been made ( e.g. , @xcite ; see a list in @xcite ) , the only published secure analog to sn1987a is sn1998a . here ,",
    "in addition to sn2000cb , we report that sn2005ci @xcite may be of the same ilk .",
    "the peculiarity of this object was already noted by the caltech core - collapse project @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we have only partial coverage of the unfiltered light curve from kait ( see table [ phot05ci_table ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the resemblance to sn2000cb is striking .",
    "while sn2005ci is fainter by @xmath102mag ( to some extent this could be due to extinction , which we can not constrain ) , the rise times are nearly identical , as can be seen in the top panel of figure [ f:05ci ] .",
    "the bottom panel shows a spectrum of sn2005ci at @xmath103d after explosion compared to that of  at a similar phase .",
    "the two spectra are qualitatively similar , although the features of sn05ci are much weaker .",
    "the velocities of the hydrogen absorption minima are measured to be @xmath104 15,000 kms@xmath0 and @xmath104 13,000 kms@xmath0 for h@xmath1 and h@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "these match well the velocities of  at a comparable phase ( fig .",
    "[ velocities ] ) , and they are significantly higher than those measured for sne1999em and 1987a .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    this additional identification raises the number of such sne discovered by the lick observatory sn search to two out of 52 sneii - p discovered over the period studied by @xcite , in a volume - limited sample .",
    "the corresponding rate is @xmath105% that of normal sneii - p , where the dominant error is derived from poisson statistics .",
    "since sneii - p are the most abundant sne in the universe , this is not an insignificant fraction , on the order of 2% of all core - collapse sne .",
    "the rate we derive is consistent with the one determined by @xcite  less than @xmath104 3%  by counting all sne within about 28mpc and assuming the sample is reasonably complete and representative .",
    "it would be of interest to study the metallicities of the locations of these sne , given the possibility that massive stars are more likely to explode as bsgs than as rsgs at low metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the location of  in the outskirts of its host spiral galaxy suggests a relatively low metallicity , in fact .",
    "recently , @xcite have measured the metallicity of h  ii regions near the positions of cc  sne , including one in the general vicinity of sn2000cb , for which they find an oxygen abundance ( @xmath106 from the o3n2 method ) that is close to typical for sneii and ii - p . however , that h  ii region was more than 3  kpc away from the supernova , so it may not give an accurate estimate of the metallicity in the progenitor s immediate environment .",
    "we have presented data and analysis of , a peculiar type ii sn , with an atypical light curve and extreme photospheric velocities .  strongly resists our attempts to cast it into the standard snii - p category while also avoiding identity with sn1987a .",
    "photometrically it is intrinsically redder than sn1999em and fainter by about 0.5mag on the plateau .",
    "it rises to maximum brightness much more slowly than a normal snii - p , yet this rise is faster than that of sn1987a and proceeds with a distinctively different colour and luminosity evolution .",
    "the main spectroscopic peculiarity lies in the exceptionally high velocities of its features at all times , most notably for the hydrogen absorption .",
    "our modeling , as well as extensive comparisons to other sne , favour a high - energy explosion of a relatively small - radius star , most probably a bsg .",
    "we derive a rate for bsg explosions that is on the order of 2% of the rate of all core - collapse sne .",
    "sneii - p are the most abundant sne in the universe and originate from the explosion of rsgs , the most abundant evolved massive stars .",
    "sn1987a is the keystone of modern type ii sn theory , despite being the explosion of a bsg .",
    "linking peculiar sne such as sn1987a and  to regular sneii is critical for elucidating the processes that bring a star from formation to obliteration .",
