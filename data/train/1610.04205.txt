    "the theoretical investigation of the ground state properties of strongly correlated systems is one of the hardest problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "many relevant models lack an analytical solution , and the exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the hamiltonian matrix , while it can certainly offer useful insights , remains restricted to system sizes in general too small to provide a reliable description of the physical scenarios in the thermodynamic limit . in order to overcome this limitation a variety of numerical techniques have been developed , each of which has an optimal realm of applicability .",
    "for example , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches@xcite provide essentially exact results for unfrustrated bosonic problems in any spatial dimension .",
    "however , qmc is hardly applicable without approximations to frustrated bosonic or fermionic systems , where the so called  sign problem \" results in an exponential loss of accuracy of the results when decreasing temperature or increasing the number of particles .",
    "@xcite conversely , variational approaches based on the optimization of a trial wave function ( wf ) are sign - problem free ; however , their accuracy ultimately depends on the choice and flexibility of the adopted ansatz for the wf .",
    "recently , an impressive effort has been devoted to the development of tensor - network wf s able to describe strongly correlated systems in two spatial dimensions@xcite ( 2d ) i.e. , where the applicability of matrix product states@xcite and density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) methods , extremely accurate in 1d , appears problematic .",
    "one of the fundamental models used to characterize the behavior of strongly correlated electrons in 2d is the @xmath0 model,@xcite which is thought to provide an effective hamiltonian description of the basic features of superconducting copper oxides .",
    "key properties of the insulating copper - oxide planes at half - filling are reproduced by the spin-@xmath7 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model i.e. , the limiting case of the @xmath0 hamiltonian in the absence of holes.@xcite the presence of mobile holes that may change the nature of the copper - oxide planes from insulating to superconducting is described in the @xmath0 model via an additional nearest - neighbor hopping term .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath8 where the brackets restrict the sum to nearest neighbor sites of a square lattice comprising @xmath9 sites .",
    "here , @xmath10 creates an electron with spin projection ( e.g. along the @xmath11 axis ) @xmath12 on site @xmath13 excluding double occupancy , @xmath14 is the standard fermionic creation operator , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number and spin-@xmath17 operator , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) @xmath18 is the antiferromagnetic coupling , and @xmath19 the hopping amplitude , taken in the following as energy unit .    aside from its physical interest related to its possible direct relevance to high - temperature superconductivity , the model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) constitutes one of the most challenging benchmarks to assess the accuracy of a given variational approach / wf . for this problem  exact \" qmc techniques are applicable at half - filling,@xcite where the @xmath0 model does not have fermionic character , as well as to the static single - hole scenario .",
    "accurate qmc strategies are also possible in the case of a single mobile hole .",
    "@xcite the addition of a second hole , however , introduces a severe sign problem that calls , in the qmc framework , for various , hardly controllable approximations and workarounds . a valid option to tackle the two - hole problem in ( quasi- ) 1d ladder geometries is dmrg,@xcite while in 2d the optimization of a suitable wf that allows for the investigation of system sizes larger than those treatable with ed likely represents a preferable choice . in this framework the estimated ground state energy , as a strict upper bound of the actual value , constitutes a natural figure of merit to evaluate the accuracy of different ansatze .",
    "+ in this paper we study the ground state of two holes in the @xmath0 model by using an entangled - plaquette wf.@xcite such a tensor - network - based wf , founded on the variational family of the entangled - plaquette states ( eps ) , has been successfully employed to investigate different unfrustrated and frustrated models providing results of comparable or better accuracy than those obtainable with alternative wf s or techniques.@xcite in the case of a single mobile hole,@xcite for example , it provides estimates of ground state energy and hole spectral weight in excellent agreement with the most accurate results available in literature , based on qmc.@xcite here , we show that an eps wf including both square and linear plaquettes of limited sizes is able to faithfully describe the ground state of two holes in the @xmath0 model .",
    "the error on our estimates of the ground state energies for eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) relative to the exact ones available for the @xmath20 lattice is of the order or less than @xmath21 for all values of @xmath5 explored in this work . by considering square lattices of much larger size ( i.e. , up to @xmath1 )",
    "we show that binding of the two holes occurs for all of the analyzed values of @xmath5 ; specifically , we find an exponential decay of the probability of finding two holes at distance @xmath4 in the large-@xmath4 limit and that the two - hole binding energy , although with an absolute value considerably smaller than the one of the system with @xmath3 , stays negative in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we estimate @xmath22 as the critical value below which the existence of a bound state characterized by the @xmath23 symmetry , predicted by previous studies in our chosen parameter range , is excluded .",
    "the accuracy of our findings for the two - hole @xmath0 model is a fundamental step towards the design of an eps wf for the finite hole concentration scenario where the physics is still not completely understood .",
    "it is worth mentioning that relevant states proposed for the many - hole problem have a straightforward representation in terms of eps@xcite and essentially every wf may systematically be improved by taking advantage of the peculiar characteristics of the eps ansatz ( see below ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss the eps ansatz adopted in this work , also recalling the main properties of the general eps wf .",
    "then we present our results , and compare them with those obtained via alternative approaches .",
    "finally we outline our conclusions pointing out possible extensions of the present work .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of @xmath24 spin-1/2 particles on a lattice comprising @xmath25 no doubly occupied sites .",
    "the wf for such a system can be written as a weighted superposition of all possible configurations in the form : @xmath26 .  here ,",
    "@xmath27 , with @xmath28 , ( @xmath29 ) , or @xmath30 if site @xmath13 is occupied by a particle with  up \" (  down \" ) spin projection along an arbitrarily chosen axis , or empty .",
    "the general idea of the eps ansatz is to express the weight @xmath31 of a generic global configuration @xmath32 in terms of variational coefficients in biunivocal correspondence with the configuration of different groups of sites i.e. , plaquettes .",
    "the simplest ( non entangled ) plaquette ansatz consists of choosing @xmath33 where @xmath34 are variational coefficients associated with the configuration of the single site [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:0](a ) ] , labeled by @xmath35 , of the @xmath36 plaquette . this choice results in a mean - field - like wf where correlations are neglected .",
    "however , they can be promptly incorporated in the ansatz by increasing the plaquette size .",
    "while in the case of non overlapping plaquettes [ fig .",
    "[ fig:0](b ) ] correlations are well described for distances of the order of the plaquette size , a reliable description of long range correlations is obtainable , even with relatively small plaquettes , when the latter overlap ( i.e. , are entangled ) . clearly , any eps ansatz is a legitimate variational choice regardless of the size of the plaquette used . in other words",
    "one can adopt a given plaquette size and provide variational estimates with an accuracy related to the given dimension of the plaquettes .",
    "this is exactly as in any variational calculation based on different wf?s , where the accuracy is related to the chosen variational ansatz .",
    "furthermore , the eps wf is systematically improvable by enlarging the size of the plaquettes and/or by including plaquettes of various shapes correlating specific groups of sites , being exact in the limit of a single plaquette as large as the system .",
    "our adopted eps wf for the study of the ground state properties of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) on an @xmath25-site square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , in the presence of two mobile holes , is @xmath37    where @xmath38 refers to a configuration with @xmath39 comprising @xmath40 electrons and @xmath41 holes at sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 ) .",
    "the above ansatz includes two classes of plaquettes characterized by index @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . specifically , we consider @xmath25 square plaquettes comprising @xmath47 sites , where their configuration , for a given plaquette , is labeled via @xmath48 and linear string - like plaquettes joining sites @xmath43 and @xmath42 comprising @xmath49 sites so that @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a nearest neighbor of @xmath42 . examples of plaquettes belonging to both classes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:0](c ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the number of down spins in one of the two sublattices of the square lattices and @xmath54 the hole - number operator at site @xmath13 ; similarly @xmath55 where the first term on the right - hand side counts the number of down spins comprised in the @xmath56 string - like plaquette and @xmath57 @xmath58 if the distance between @xmath42 and @xmath51 is @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting phase factor @xmath61 , reduces at half - filling to the exact marshall sign rule,@xcite and , for the present study , is found , in our explored parameter range , to improve the optimization of the wave function favoring the emergence of the ground state properties of the system + in our calculations we set @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath63 plaquettes and consider string plaquettes comprising up to @xmath64 sites .",
    "a null weight has been assigned to system configurations in which holes are connected by longer strings .",
    "we carry out independent optimizations of the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) for each lattice size and value of @xmath5 considered here via the variational monte carlo algorithm described in ref .  [ ] and use the same numerical approach to estimate the observables of our interest . in particular , for @xmath65 we compute ( i ) the two - hole ground state energy defined as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are the ground state energies of model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) with two holes ( at half filling ) , ( ii ) the probability distribution @xmath69 of finding the two holes at distance @xmath4 , as well as ( iii ) the two - hole binding energy @xmath70 where the one - hole ground state energy @xmath71 has been estimated by means of the eps ansatz based on @xmath63 plaquettes proposed by one of us in ref .  [ ] .",
    "it has to be stressed that with our chosen dimension of the plaquettes we obtain remarkable agreement with ed calculations@xcite for both the single- and the two - hole problems ; similarly , on large lattices our estimates of both the single- and the two - holes ground state energies are in extremely good agreement with the most accurate results available in literature@xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "this is an important point since a consistent increase of the plaquette size e.g. , by considering square plaquettes of 16 sites , if doable , would be extremely expensive from a computational point of view due to the dimension ( i.e. ,  3 ) of the local hilbert space of the @xmath0 model . our findings for @xmath72 obtained for",
    "lattices of up to @xmath1 sites , that is , much larger than those treatable with exact methods , demonstrate the existence of a two - hole bound state for any value of @xmath5 considered here .",
    "estimates of the two - hole binding energy extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit and for values of @xmath5 lower than @xmath73 suggest that a two - hole bound state does not exist with the same symmetry characteristic of the range of @xmath5 values explored in this work for @xmath74 .",
    "while for small system sizes ( i.e. , up to @xmath75 ) it is possible to describe the ground state properties of model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) essentially exactly by means of an eps wf based on a single plaquette that correlates all the lattice sites , such a choice is not a viable option for larger lattices .",
    "our variational state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) , where plaquettes comprising a limited number of sites are used , provides accurate energy upper bounds for the lattice with @xmath3 and is applicable to considerably larger lattice sizes using standard computational resources .",
    "for example , on the @xmath76 square lattice we find , at @xmath77 , @xmath78 which compares extremely well with the exact result@xcite @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting eps two - hole ground state energy is @xmath80 , which has to be compared with @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to contrast our results with those obtained by means of a green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) approach based on the extrapolation of transient energy estimates generated by the gfmc algorithm starting from a suitable initial state .",
    "for the two - hole @xmath0 model , the gfmc technique is affected by the fermionic sign problem and the mentioned extrapolation can be performed by using just a few transient estimates before the occurrence of an uncontrolled growth of the statistical uncertainty ultimately due to sign instability .",
    "consequently , the choice of the initial state is crucial in the case of gfmc as it has to produce reliable estimates in a limited number of algorithm iterations .",
    "although for @xmath77 this procedure gives an extrapolated value @xmath82 , in agreement with our eps result , we note that the gfmc zero - th , variational , iteration based on the initial wf provides a two - hole ground state energy more than @xmath83 times larger .",
    "this demonstrates that our eps ansatz is much more accurate than the initial variational state adopted in ref .",
    "[ ] and , more importantly , suggests our wf as a nearly optimal one to start a gfmc numerical scheme consisting of few iterations .",
    "the latter , aside from the above mentioned possibility of adding variational flexibility to a general eps wf by including larger plaquettes , constitutes a further opportunity to improve numerical estimates .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows eps results for the two - hole ground state energy @xmath84 as a function of the system size @xmath25 and various values of @xmath5 .",
    "the relative error of our numerical estimates with respect to the exact results obtainable for the @xmath3 lattice ( i.e. , the smallest considered here ) is of the order of @xmath85 or less regardless of the @xmath5 value . on larger lattices",
    "our two - hole ground state energies compare extremely well with gfmc ones ; at @xmath77 , for example , our estimated value for the @xmath86 system is @xmath87 in numerical agreement , taking into account the quoted error bars , with the gfmc result i.e. , @xmath88.@xcite by means of a simple extrapolation of our data to the thermodynamic limit based on a polynomial expansion in powers of @xmath89 ( dashed lines in figures ) we find that the two - hole ground state energy monotonically decreases with decreasing @xmath5 being e.g. , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "our extrapolated results are in substantial agreement with the estimates for the largest lattice size studied in this work ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) pointing out how the eps ansatz allows , for the model of our interest , to investigate lattices large enough to provide a good approximation of the physics emerging in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the probability @xmath72 of finding the two holes at distance @xmath4 on the @xmath76 lattice for chosen values of @xmath92 and @xmath73 is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "this quantity displays an oscillating behavior with a global maximum at @xmath93 for @xmath92 . for lower @xmath5",
    "the position of such a maximum shifts to @xmath94 and @xmath72 at larger @xmath4 increases , signaling an enhanced propensity of the two holes to reside on distant lattice sites . this may possibly result for larger system sizes in an  unbound \" two - hole ground state .",
    "conversely , if the two holes form a bound state @xmath72 is expected to feature an exponential decay at large distances.@xcite    figure [ fig:2 ] shows estimates of @xmath72 on a lattice of @xmath95 sites .",
    "although the qualitative behavior of the two - hole distribution function is similar to that found for @xmath3 here , as expected , holes are more separated on average .",
    "the smaller is the value of @xmath5 , the larger is their tendency to increase their relative distance .",
    "however , for large @xmath4 our data are well described by the simple functional form @xmath96 where , for @xmath97 ( see inset ) , we estimate @xmath98 . by increasing the lattice size to @xmath1 the value of @xmath99 stays essentially unchanged . on the basis of this analysis",
    "we can conclude that the two holes form a bound state for all the values @xmath65 examined in our study .",
    "quantitative information about the two - hole bound state are obtainable by computing the binding energy @xmath100 defined in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "a negative value of this quantity signals the existence of the bound state . in order to estimate @xmath100 , both the two- and",

    "the binding energy resulting from the combination of data in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] displays a marked dependence on the system size as well as on the values of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , for @xmath1 we find @xmath101 , a value in agreement with the gfmc estimate of @xmath102 , approximately @xmath83 times higher than that for the @xmath76 lattice . on the other hand , on a @xmath103 lattice when @xmath5 increases from @xmath73 to @xmath104 ,",
    "the two - hole binding energy decreases down to @xmath105 .",
    "values of the binding energy extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "specifically , for each value of @xmath5 , @xmath106 is computed via the corresponding extrapolations of the two- and single - hole ground state energies ( see dashed lines in figs .",

    "[ ] , the functional dependence @xmath107 $ ] , we estimate the critical value @xmath108 at which the two - hole binding energy extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit reaches zero .",
    "this estimate , in agreement with that obtained in the case of the @xmath109 lattice , indicates that for @xmath110 a bound state of two holes , if present , is characterized by a symmetry different from that ( i.e. , d - wave ) predicted by several studies in the parameter range of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "indeed , a change in the symmetry of the bound state should occur for @xmath111@xcite ( or  @xmath112).@xcite +",
    "we have shown that the entangled - plaquette variational ansatz can be applied to study the ground state properties of two mobile holes in a two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet for lattice sizes considerably larger than those treatable with exact approaches . obtained energy estimates are in remarkable agreement with exact results on a @xmath3 lattice .",
    "we have extended our analysis to a maximum system size of @xmath1 , demonstrating the existence of a two - hole bound state for all the values of @xmath5 explored here .",
    "an extrapolation of our estimated two - hole binding energy in the large @xmath25 limit to low values of @xmath5 results in a critical @xmath113 below which a bound state with d - wave symmetry is not expected . including e.g. , the p - wave symmetry in the eps ansatz to investigate the existence of a different two - hole bound state in the ground state for @xmath74 as well as studying the dependence of the physical properties discussed here on the presence of a next - nearest - neighbor hopping term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) are possible interesting extensions of the present work .",
    "furthermore , although specific qmc approaches can still be adopted for the two - hole @xmath0 model at the price of a large error bar on the resulting estimates , in the finite hole density scenario , where the physical picture remains under debate,@xcite their applicability is unfeasible due to an even heavier sign problem .",
    "in such a case the eps ansatz , in the framework of a simple , by definition sign - problem free , variational approach ( e.g. , that employed here ) may constitute a viable option either as a generalization of eq .",
