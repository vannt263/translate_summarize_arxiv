    "the determination of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and the search for signals of the hadron - quark phase transition are challenges both in theory and experiment .",
    "intensive studies on these fields have been developed in the last decades @xcite .",
    "most phase diagrams have been derived from monte carlo calculations of lattice qcd  @xcite or effective chiral models  @xcite with quark degree of freedom . in the chiral effective model",
    ", one can describe well the line of chiral phase transition and the complicated phase diagram of color superconductivity  @xcite , while the confinement phase transition for the gluon part can be investigated with the extended njl model coupled to the polyakov loop  @xcite ) in the temperature and chemical potential plane .",
    "however a large uncertainty remains about the derivation of baryon density and energy density of the onset of the hadron - quark phase transition  @xcite .",
    "although there are attempts to describe nuclear and quark matter in unified effective models  @xcite , further investigations are needed to give more satisfying results , in particular at high baryon and isospin densities , of interest for the expected phase transition in heavy ion collisions and compact stars .    an alternative approach to describe the hadron - quark phase transition is based on a two - eos model with the gibbs criteria , which has been widely used to make predictions on the phase transition in the interior of neutron stars  ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we remark that , even in the two - eos approach , only a few papers have studied the phase diagram of hadron - quark transitions at high baryon density in connection to the phenomenology of heavy - ion collision ten a gev range ( intermediate energies )  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the phase transition from hadron to quark matter has been firstly analyzed for isospin asymmetric matter .",
    "it should be noticed that recently increasing attention is paid to this aspect , and some observable effects are suggested to be seen in charged meson yield ratio and in the onset of quark number scaling of the meson / baryon elliptic flows @xcite .",
    "this provides us a new orientation to investigate the hadron - quark phase transition , and can stimulate some new relevant research in the field .",
    "later , hyperons have been included in @xcite , but the calculated results show that strange baryons are not important due to the exiguous final population in the short time scale of a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "furthermore , the cooper pair effect of @xmath2 quarks ( two flavor superconductor , 2sc ) has been considered in the quark phase  @xcite , which reduces the symmetry energy difference between hadronic and quark phases .",
    "the most important conclusion emerging from these works is that the onset density of hadron - quark phase transition is smaller in asymmetric matter than that in symmetric matter , which is possibly reached through heavy - ion reactions at new planned facilities , such as fair at gsi - darmstadt and nica at jinr - dubna , where heavy ion beams  ( even unstable , with large isospin asymmetry ) will be available with good intensities in the 1 - 30 a gev energy region .",
    "one drawback in all these calculations is that current mass ( or massless ) @xmath2 quarks are taken for the quark phase , where the mit - bag like models are used .",
    "the obtained results are possibly reliable at high density , after the restoration of chiral symmetry due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , but the chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature and low densities is not accounted for . from @xmath3 to smaller densities , the dynamical masses of @xmath2",
    "quarks become larger and larger , and they almost reach @xmath4mev at @xmath5 for some parameter sets .",
    "this means that non - perturbative effects become more and more important with the decreasing baryon density .",
    "therefore , calculations of properties of the phase diagram at low density and finite temperature are not fully consistent . as a matter of fact when the mit - bag model is taken for the quark part",
    ", we see that the t-@xmath6 , t-@xmath7 phase diagrams highly depend on the values of the bag constant @xmath8 , which can not be determined accurately  @xcite .    in order to obtain more reliable theoretical results and predict possible observables in the planned experiments , we take the nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model to describe the quark phase with the interaction between quarks , where the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration are well described .",
    "it was also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that in high energy heavy - ion collisions strange and antistrange quarks can be produced by thermal excitation ( with net strangeness being zero required by the conservation law of strangeness in strong interaction ) and strangeness would be much more abundant in the quark component .",
    "therefore we will also consider the thermal excitation of strange and antistrange quark , but we need to keep the chemical potential of strange quark to be zero , @xmath9 , before the beginning of hadronization in the expanding process to make sure of the net strangeness being zero .",
    "one mechanism of hadron production is quark recombination  @xcite , which is out of the range of the discussion in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe briefly the used effective lagrangians and give the relevant formulas for the relativistic mean field ( @xmath10 ) theory adopted for the hadron sector . in section iii , we present the calculated phase diagrams and compare them with those obtained in the mit - bag model . besides , we present some discussions and conclusions .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section iv .",
    "for the hadron phase , the non - linear relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach is used , which provides an excellent description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "one can calibrate the hadronic equation of state at zero temperature and normal nuclear densities , and then extrapolate into the regime of finite density and temperature .",
    "our parametrizations are also tuned to reproduce collective flows and particle production at higher energies , where some hot and dense matter is probed , see  @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "the exchanged mesons include the isoscalar - scalar meson(@xmath11 ) , isoscalar - vector meson(@xmath12 ) , isovector - vector meson(@xmath6 ) and isovector - scalar meson(@xmath13 ) .",

    "the difference is that now @xmath70 depends on the interaction between different quarks as well as on density and temperature .",

    "so we must keep @xmath74 in the calculation according to eq .  , but the strange quarks in loop diagrams do contribute to the @xmath2 self energies via a six - point interaction , and then they can affect the dynamical mass of @xmath2 quark according to eq .  .",

    "since there are two conserved quantity , baryon number and isospin , during the phase transition , the gibbs criteria ( thermal , chemical and mechanical equilibrium ) should be implemented for the mixed phase .",
    "general discussion of phase transitions in multicomponent systems can be found in ref.@xcite .",

    "similar properties are present in the liquid - gas transition for dilute asymmetric nuclear matter , which is behind the multifragmentation processes at the fermi energies @xcite .    before closing the discussion of mit - bag results we would like to add a few comments about the interpretation of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 phase diagrams of figs .",

    "the same is happening for the large bag constant , although less evident .",

    "we have a simple interpretation :    * the `` opening '' at low baryon density and high temperature . + here the transition @xmath96 is below the nucleon effective mass ( not much reduced at low densities ) and the effective chemical potential @xmath105 even smaller .",

    "however the isospin effects discussed before are still present .",

    "if we compare mit - bag ( with fixed current quark masses ) and njl ( with chiral restoration mechanism ) results for the mixed phase we remark only one main difference . as shown in figs .",

    "the difference in the quark masses , with @xmath142 , is larger at the onset of the mixed phase , where the isospin distillation effects induces a larger difference in the two quark - antiquark condensates .",
    "*   actually we clearly see that in the same @xmath143 region we do not have solutions of the gibbs conditions .",
    "this is due to the second qualitative new feature of the @xmath94 approach , the density and temperature dependence of the `` effective bag constant '' , eq .",
    "[ beff ] , also related to the dynamical quark mass variation . as a consequence at low densities and high temperatures , for small values of the bag constant",
    "we can not get mixed phase solutions since the hadron pressure ( mostly thermal ) can not equilibrate the quark pressure in the coexistence zone . in figs .",
    "[ fig : beff - t=60 ] ,  [ fig : beff - t=75 ] we show the density dependence of @xmath138 at @xmath144 and @xmath137 ( the solid circles give the mixed phase limits ) . for the @xmath137 case",
    "we see a sudden drop around the onset of the mixed phase , good indication of a lack of solution for larger temperatures .    in conclusion",
    "the chiral dynamics seems to lead to a @xmath135 ( @xmath145 ) of the first order hadron - quark transition , around @xmath146 and @xmath147 or @xmath103 . beyond this point ,",
    "i.e. at higher temperatures and smaller baryon densities , we have to follow an approach with just one effective @xmath92 able to describe both phases in order to check if we get a continous transition .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath145 appears when the @xmath94 quark masses have reached the constituent quark values .",
    "however we are aware that the njl approach , with only chiral dynamics , is not good at low densities and finite temperatures since confinement is not accounted for ( in fact our @xmath70 goes to zero ) , just where we can expect that hadron degrees of freedom will start to play a role @xcite . a further investigation including a confinement mechanism is certainly required in order to confirm the end - point evaluation and to understand the related physics .",
    "finally correlation effects , beyond the mean field approximation , would be also more important .",
    "in any case the fact that in the @xmath148 plane around the end point we definitely get a derivative @xmath149 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : t - mu ] ) could be an indication that we are actually reaching a continous transition for chemical potentials and entropies , as suggested by the clausius - clapeyron equation @xcite .",
    "finally two more remarks :    *   from figs .",
    "[ fig : nlnjl - trhosym ] ,  [ fig : nlrhonjl - trhoasym ] ,  [ fig : nlrhodeltanjl - trhoasym ] and  [ fig : t - mu ] , we see that the end - point of the mixed phase is not depending on the global asymmetry of the system and on the symmetry term of the used hadron interaction .",
    "this is consistent with the reduced effect of the symmetry energy at high temperatures and low densities , fig .",
    "[ fig : esym - t=0 - 80 ] .",
    "*   isospin effects appear still relevant in the region just below the end - point , t@xmath0mev and @xmath1 , accessible in the transient compression stage of heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "the latter point is interesting even because in that phase diagram zone the njl and mit - bag results are very similar , for similar bag constants @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "this makes more reliable the observed isospin effects .",
    "in this work , we investigate the hadron - quark phase transition in isospin asymmetric matter .",
    "we use a two - eos approach as in all previous calculations .",
    "the novelty of this study is to insert chiral restoration effects on the quark masses using the 3-flavor njl model for interacting quark instead of the mit bag model .",
    "we obtain the binodal surface of a first order hadron - quark phase transition in the region of @xmath151 and temperature @xmath152 less than about 80mev , available in heavy - ion experiments in the near future .",
    "the calculated results show that the onset density of the phase transition is lowered with the increasing asymmetry parameter @xmath83 , property possible to be probed in the new planned facilities , for example , fair at gsi - darmstadt and nica at jinr - dubna , with realistic asymmetries for stable beams , see  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams at high density are like the ones given by the mit bag , model with appropriate bag constant , since the chiral symmetry is restored and the quark masses approach the current values . but the dynamical quark mass becomes more and more important with the reduction of baryon number density and the increase of temperature , causing a reduction of the effective bag constant .",
    "the resulting effect is more relevant just in the region t@xmath0mev and @xmath1 , available with the new planed facilities , where some suggested important observables may be found as the signals of hadron - quark phase transition in the future .",
    "the most interesting effect of the use of a consistent chiral quark mass dynamics is the appearance of a kind of critical - end point for the first order transition , around @xmath146 and @xmath147 or @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore the obtained phase diagram exhibits a region with confinement but chiral restored symmetry , as expected for the @xmath153 matter @xcite .    at variance with the results with the mit - bag quark @xmath92 , the phase diagram at lower density and higher temperature",
    "can not be derived from the gibbs conditions in a two - eos model , which means that chiral symmetry is very important in the phase transition .",
    "this conclusion stimulates new efforts in the search of an unique @xmath92 , with chiral dynamics and confinement mechanism , able to describe both phases in the region just above the suggested critical - end - point .",
