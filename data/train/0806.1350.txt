    "generically , one has @xmath14 instead of the non - linear term , with @xmath15 the speed of growth as a function of the slope @xmath16 , having the property @xmath17 .",
    "the long time evolution has a deterministic macroscopic behavior , i.e. , the limit shape @xmath18 is non - random . to see a non - trivial fluctuation behavior one has to focus on an appropriate mesoscopic scale .    for the kpz class in @xmath0 dimensions , the _ correlation exponent _ is @xmath5 and",
    "the _ fluctuation exponent _ is @xmath19  @xcite , that is , the rescaled height function at time @xmath2 @xmath20 will converge to a non - trivial process as @xmath21 .",
    "the rescaling ( [ eqrescaledheight ] ) makes sense as soon as the macroscopic shape is smooth in a neighborhood of @xmath22 .",
    "however , depending on the initial conditions , ( [ eqkpzequation ] ) can produce spikes in the macroscopic shape .",
    "if one looks at the surface gradient @xmath13 , the spikes of @xmath23 corresponds to shocks in @xmath16 , and it is known that the shock position fluctuates on a scale @xmath24 . for particular models ,",
    "properties of the shocks have been analyzed , but mostly for stationary growth ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss spike - free regions of the surface , where the limit shape @xmath25 is smooth .",
    "recent results obtained by analyzing solvable models in the kpz class , show that the limit processes are not as universal as the scaling exponent , but one has to divide into a _",
    "few _ subclasses .",
    "one of the most studied model is the polynuclear growth ( png ) model , which we shortly introduce . at time @xmath2 , the surface is described by an integer - valued height function @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with steps of size one .",
    "it thus consists of up - steps ( @xmath28 ) and down - steps ( @xmath29 ) , see figure  [ figpng ] .",
    "the dynamics has a deterministic and a stochastic part :    * up- ( down- ) steps move to the left ( right ) with unit speed and disappear upon colliding , * pairs of up- and down- steps ( nucleations ) are randomly added on the surface with some given intensity .",
    "the up- and down - steps of the nucleations then spread out with unit speed according to ( i ) .",
    "analytic results have been obtained in the following cases starting with a flat initial substrate @xmath30 , @xmath31 . + _ ( a ) png droplet : _ the nucleations form a poisson point process in space - time with intensity @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 otherwise .",

    "recently , we proved ( [ eqconvairy1 ] ) for the png model with flat growth too  @xcite .",
    "all these convergence are in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions .    for a precise a definition of the airy@xmath45 and airy@xmath39 processes",
    ", we refer to the original papers  @xcite and the review  @xcite , in which also known properties are summarized , e.g. , the one - point distribution given by the tracy - widom distributions of random matrix  @xcite .",
    "it can also happen that curved part of the surface becomes straight ( smoothly ) .",
    "then , the surface will be described by the transition process studied in  @xcite .",
    "the last typical case is stationary growth , see  @xcite , to which we come back at the end of the paper .",
    "the above results concern the description of the interface at a given large time @xmath2 .",
    "however , they do not say anything about the correlations of the surface height at _ different times_. first in  @xcite for the png droplet and more recently in  @xcite for flat png , results along _ space - like _ paths have been obtained .",
    "let us remind what it is meant with space - like paths .",
    "a path @xmath48 in space - time is then called space - like if @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "suppose that we want to analyze the surface of the png droplet in a neighborhood of the space - time position @xmath51 , for some @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose @xmath54 and set @xmath55 borodin and olshanski prove  @xcite that for space - like paths @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in particular , the correlations between @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 are identical to the correlations between @xmath59 and @xmath62 if .",

    "@xcite we prove that for space - like paths @xmath66 , @xmath67          at first sight surprisingly , the scaling coefficients in ( [ eqspacelikeairy1 ] ) _ do not depend on the slope of the space - like path_. similarly , in ( [ eqspacelikeairy2 ] ) the correlations are the same if we follow lines with constant angle .",
    "the reason is that the space - time is fibred in a non - trivial way : along certain directions the decorrelation is much more slow , on a @xmath69 scale for some scaling exponent @xmath70 .",
    "* main result .",
    "* by considering the png model we show that @xmath68 .    for the flat png , the particular curves are parallel to the time axis , while for the png droplet are the one keeping a constant angle . in general , these curves are such that the gradient of the surface is constant : the _ characteristics curves _ of the following pde .",
    "let @xmath13 be the slope of the surface .",
    "then , on a macroscopic scale , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the effective speed including the noise effect in ( [ eqkpzequation ] ) . then , taking the spatial derivative , we get @xmath73 the characteristics of this equation are the trajectories satisfying @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    for the polynuclear growth model , one has @xmath76",
    "@xcite , from which one verifies that the slow directions of figure  [ figfibration ] are indeed the characteristics . why are precisely the characteristics curves to have slow decorrelations ? because the information flows along them , so on a macroscopic scale , the fluctuations of the height is influenced by the randomness occurring around the characteristics .    in general",
    ", since characteristics can cross  @xcite and one has the phenomena of shock formation . in that case",
    ", the derivative of the limit shape has a discontinuity . as said in the introduction , in this paper we focus away from this situation . in terms of the slope",
    "@xmath16 , we consider cases without shocks , i.e. , either with constant @xmath16 or in the rarefaction regions .",
    "we believe that the same phenomena occurs in higher dimensions too . in a recent work with a.",
    "borodin  @xcite on a model in the anisotropic kpz class in @xmath77 dimensions a similar phenomena of slow curves seems to occur .",
    "a first consequence is that , as soon as we do not follow the characteristics , ( [ eqspacelikeairy1 ] ) and ( [ eqspacelikeairy2 ] ) hold _ without the space - like constraint_. to illustrate it , let us state the precise result for joint distributions in the png droplet , which is proven in section  [ sectproofdroplet ] .",
    "[ thmpngdroplet ] consider the parametrization ( [ eqdropletparam ] ) but this time @xmath66 is any space - time path with @xmath54 and @xmath78 , i.e. , we exclude the case of the path @xmath66 following the characteristics .",
    "then , in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions , @xmath79 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the analogue for the flat png is that ( [ eqspacelikeairy1 ] ) holds for any finite @xmath80 , since in that case the characteristics corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , to get a different behavior from the airy processes for the height - height correlation , one has to rescale the component of the space - time path along characteristics with the scaling exponent @xmath68 and the other component using the scaling exponent @xmath5 .",
    "for example , for the flat png , one has consider the scaling @xmath82 then , the observable to be analyzed is the two - parameter limit process of the height function rescaled as @xmath83 the description of this limit process remains an open problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we give a heuristic argument for @xmath84 can not be strictly less than one .",
    "then we prove it for the png droplet ( theorem  [ thmdroplet ] ) .",
    "this needs also a technical control of the maximum ( corollary  [ corollary ] ) for which tightness is needed .",
    "for the flat png geometry a similar result will hold ( claim  [ propflat ] ) .",
    "in these two cases , one actually sees that the heuristic argument is the right interpretation .",
    "finally , in proposition  [ propstatpng ] , we show the same result for stationary growth , which turns out to be much simpler , but in the proof there is no trace of the mechanism .      the first time i though about this problem was after a short discussion with h.  spohn and b.  virg at the random matrix conference during the hausdorff research institute for mathematics , bonn ( 2008 ) .",
    "i m grateful to h.  spohn and a.  borodin for helpful discussions .",
    "in this section we prove that for the png model , for any @xmath85 , if we take two points along the special directions at time @xmath86 and time @xmath87 , then they are trivially correlated on the fluctuation scale @xmath88 . but first let us present a heuristic argument , which then it is transformed into a proof for the png model .",

    "consider two positions on one of such curves , say @xmath91 at time @xmath86 and @xmath92 at time @xmath87 ( the white and black dots in figure  [ figheuristics ] ) .",
    "we have the following facts :    * the correlation exponent is @xmath5 , therefore the fluctuations of the heights at @xmath91 and @xmath92 are correlated with the randomness occurring in a strip of order @xmath89 around the characteristics .",

    "* again , because the correlation exponent is @xmath5 , the fluctuations of the height function at time @xmath86 in a @xmath90-neighborhood of @xmath91 differ from the fluctuations of the height at @xmath91 by @xmath96 . * the fluctuation exponent is @xmath19 , meaning that during a time interval @xmath86 , fluctuations are created on a @xmath88 scale .    by ( 1 ) , the height at @xmath92 is the sum of the height at some point in a @xmath90-neighborhood of @xmath91 plus the contribution during the remaining @xmath69 time interval . by ( 2 ) ,",
    "the fluctuations of the first term is equal to the fluctuations of the height at @xmath91 up to an @xmath97 term . by ( 3 ) ,",
    "the fluctuations in the second term are only of order @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , on the natural scale of fluctuations , @xmath88 , the height of @xmath91 and @xmath92 are trivially correlated in the @xmath99 limit ( i.e. , the difference is only a deterministic factor ) .        in the proof ,",

    "the length of a path is the number of poisson points visited .",

    "we call _ maximizers _ the paths of longest length . as noticed in  @xcite , the height function of the png droplet at position @xmath63 , @xmath104 , can be expressed by @xmath111 , namely @xmath112    for the flat png , the only difference is @xmath113 , which implies that the height function is given by ( [ eqdp1 ] ) but for @xmath111 the optimization is made line - to - point : from @xmath114 to @xmath106 .",
    "more details can be found in the literature , for example in section 3 of  @xcite .          to transform the heuristic argument into the proof of theorem  [ thmdroplet ] , we use results of",
    "@xcite which control the geometric distribution of the maximizers close to the end points . the results in  @xcite use ideas from in  @xcite about transversal fluctuations",
    ". then , it will only remain one technical difficulty : the convergence to the airy@xmath39 process of  @xcite are in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "this is not enough to conclude that the maximum converges : a tightness result is needed .",

    "if we consider a point @xmath51 and apply the mapping @xmath119 we recover the situation with @xmath118 with time given by @xmath120 instead of @xmath86 .",
    "this mapping preserves the poisson measure on nucleations and , in the percolation picture directed paths remain directed .",
