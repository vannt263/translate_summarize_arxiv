    "in recent years many attempts have been made to understand nucleon structure functions as measured in lepton deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "although perturbative qcd is successful in describing the dependence of structure functions on the squared momentum transfer , their magnitude is governed by the non - perturbative physics of composite particles , and is up to now not calculable directly from qcd .",
    "a variety of models have been invoked to describe nucleon structure functions .",
    "the so called `` spectator model '' is a typical covariant approach amongst them@xcite . in this approach the leading twist , non - singlet quark distributions",
    "are calculated from the process in which the target nucleon splits into a valence quark , which is scattered by the virtual photon , and a spectator system carrying baryon number @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore the spectrum of spectator states is assumed to be saturated through single scalar and vector diquarks .",
    "thus , the main ingredient of these models are covariant quark - diquark vertex functions .",
    "until now vertex functions have been merely parameterized such that the measured quark distributions are reproduced , and no attempts have been made to connect them to some dynamical models of the nucleon . in this work",
    "we construct the vertex functions from a model lagrangian by solving the bethe  salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "however , we do not aim at a detailed , quantitative description of nucleon structure functions in the present work .",
    "rather we outline how to extract quark - diquark vertex functions from euclidean solutions of the bse . in this context",
    "several simplifications are made .",
    "we consider only scalar diquarks as spectators and restrict ourselves to the @xmath5 flavor group .",
    "the inclusion of vector diquarks and the generalization to @xmath6 flavor are relatively straightforward extensions and will be left for future work .",
    "the cross section for dis of leptons from a nucleon is characterized by the hadronic tensor @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the four - momenta of the target and exchanged virtual photon respectively . for unpolarized dis ,",
    "the hadronic tensor @xmath10 is conventionally parameterized by two scalar functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the bjorken limit ( @xmath13 ; but finite @xmath14 ) in which we work throughout , both structure functions depend ( up to logarithmic corrections ) on @xmath15 only , and are related via the callan - gross relation : @xmath16 .    in the scalar diquark spectator model within @xmath5 flavor ,",
    "the valence quark distributions are extracted from the hadronic tensor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diquarkspectatorfort ] ) : @xmath17 where the isospin matrix element @xmath18 has to be evaluated in the nucleon isospin space .",
    "we define @xmath19 as the target nucleon spinor and we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to denote the propagators of the quark and scalar diquark , respectively .",
    "the integration runs over the quark momentum @xmath22 , subject to on  mass  shell conditions for the diquark and the struck quark .",
    "note that the vertex function @xmath23 and its pt conjugate @xmath24 consist of two lorentz scalar functions which depend on @xmath25 only because the diquark is on shell . in the next section",
    "we shall determine the vertex functions using a ladder bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we consider the following model lagrangian : @xmath26 where we have explicitly indicated color @xmath6 indices only . the symmetric generator @xmath27 of the flavor @xmath5 group acts on the iso  doublet field @xmath28 for the constituent quark carrying an invariant mass @xmath29 .",
    "the charged scalar field @xmath30 denotes the flavor ",
    "singlet scalar diquark with invariant mass @xmath31 .    in this model",
    "the nucleon with the momentum @xmath8 and spin @xmath32 is described by the bs vertex function @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bsvertex ] ) : @xmath33 where we set the weight factors to the classical values : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "then the vertex function @xmath23 obeys in the ladder approximation the following bse ( fig.[fig : ladderbse ] ) : @xmath36 to solve the bse for positive energy nucleon states we are free to choose the following dirac matrix structure : @xmath37\\lambda^{(+)}(p ) ,          \\label{define_f}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 , the projector onto positive energy nucleon states .",
    "we assume that the diquark and the nucleon are stable , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we then perform the wick rotation of the relative energy variable and choose the nucleon rest frame : @xmath41 .",
    "the `` euclidean '' functions @xmath42 in terms of the momentum @xmath43 for a real @xmath44 are then functions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "we expand each of these functions ( @xmath47 ) as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are gegenbauer polynomials and the phase @xmath50 is introduced for convenience since then the radial functions @xmath51 are real .",
    "the bse in eq.([ladderbse ] ) then reduces to the following system of one  dimensional equations : @xmath52 where we have introduced the `` eigenvalue '' @xmath53 for the quark ",
    "diquark coupling constant .",
    "the kernel function @xmath54 is a matrix whose elements are real and regular functions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by terminating the infinite series in eq.([expanf ] ) at sufficiently high order",
    ", we can easily solve eq.([fn_eq ] ) numerically as an `` eigenvalue '' problem for a fixed bound state mass , @xmath57 . to compare the magnitude of the radial functions ,",
    "let us introduce the normalized @xmath58 radial functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 together with the @xmath58 spherical spinor harmonics @xmath61@xcite . in the conventional gamma matrix representation we can write the nucleon solution at rest as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes angles for @xmath64 vector in the four  dimentional polar coordinate system .",
    "the factor @xmath65 is introduced such that @xmath66 , while @xmath60 is expressed as a linear combination of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . thus @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to the `` upper '' and `` lower '' components of the nucleon dirac field , respectively .",
    "now , let us consider the analytic continuation of @xmath71 .",
    "since we are interested in applying the bs vertex function to the dis process , we need to rotate the relative energy variable from on the imaginary axis back to on the real one .",
    "recall that the sum over @xmath72 in eq.([expanf ] ) converges even for a complex @xmath73 , if @xmath74 .",
    "we can then analytically continue the gegenbauer polynomials rewriting the argument @xmath75 for the momenta satisfying @xmath76 . for the radial functions we introduce new functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "and @xmath79 are functions of @xmath80 was confirmed numerically .",
    "] we analytically continue these functions by changing the argument @xmath81 .",
    "we obtain the physical scalar functions @xmath82 : @xmath83 note that the gegenbauer polynomials together with the square root factors are polynomials of @xmath84 , @xmath57 , and @xmath85 , so that each term in the series ( [ f1minkowski ] ) and ( [ f2minkowski ] ) is regular and real as far as @xmath86 and @xmath87 are regular",
    ". we may then impose the on  mass  shell condition for the diquark and evaluate the sum over @xmath72 .",
    "the resulting @xmath88 and @xmath89 are then functions of the squared quark momentum @xmath25 and can be applied to the dis process .    however , the expressions ( [ f1minkowski ] ) and ( [ f2minkowski ] ) are valid only for momenta satisfying @xmath90 .",
    "also we found that a naive numerical sum over @xmath72 , based on eqs.([f1minkowski ] ) and ( [ f2minkowski ] ) does not converge .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that the vertex function @xmath23 for any kinematically allowed @xmath25 is regular when the diquark is on  mass  shell .",
    "this suggests that one may be able to continue some appropriate linear combinations of @xmath88 and @xmath89 outside of this kinematical range .",
    "indeed , we found such a combination which we denote by @xmath91 . in terms of this on  shell scalar functions and the quark momentum , @xmath22 , the vertex function @xmath23 together with the diquark on  mass  shell condition is given by @xmath92 with this on  shell vertex function the valence contribution to the structure function @xmath93 can now be calculated from eq.([compton ] ) .",
    "in this section we present our numerical results . for simplicity we considered an equal mass system ; @xmath94 , and we shall use @xmath95 as a unit for dimensionful quantities . to solve the bse we used a @xmath96channel form factor .",
    "we replaced the quark ",
    "diquark coupling constant such that @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath96 is the usual mandelstam variable .",
    "this form factor weakens the short range interaction between the constituents and ensures the existence of a discrete bound state spectrum for a large range of @xmath57 .",
    "we solved eq.([fn_eq ] ) as follows .",
    "first we terminated the infinite series in eq.([expanf ] ) at some fixed value , @xmath99 .",
    "next we discretized the euclidean momentum @xmath55 and @xmath56 and performed the integration over @xmath56 numerically together with some initially assumed radial functions @xmath100 .",
    "this integral generated new radial functions and an `` eigenvalue '' @xmath101 associated with them .",
    "we then used these functions as an input and repeated the above procedure until the radial functions and @xmath101 converged .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fandg ] we plot the normalized @xmath58 radial functions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for the bound state mass @xmath102 as functions of @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that the magnitude of the radial functions with higher @xmath58 angular momentum are strongly suppressed compared with the lowest ones .",
    "this justifies the truncation of the series in eq.([expanf ] ) .",
    "it also confirms that the contribution to the `` eigenvalue '' @xmath101 from the @xmath58 radial functions with @xmath103 is less than 1 % .",
    "the dominance of the lowest @xmath58 radial function has been also observed in the scalar ",
    "scalar ladder model@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fon ] we plot the physical , on  shell scalar functions @xmath104 for the bound state mass @xmath102 as functions of the squared quark momentum , @xmath25 .",
    "these functions are calculated with the maximum @xmath58 angular momentum @xmath105 .",
    "we found that the magnitude of @xmath106 and @xmath107 are almost the same even for weakly bound states .",
    "this result suggests that so  called `` non  relativistic '' approximations , in which one neglects the non  leading components of the vertex function ( @xmath89 in our model ) are valid only for extremely weakly bound states : @xmath108 .",
    "we have also confirmed that for weakly bound states ( @xmath109 ) the dependence of @xmath104 on @xmath110 is negligible for a small spacelike @xmath25 , e.g. , @xmath111 .",
    "however , for large spacelike @xmath25 , the convergence of the sum over @xmath72 becomes slow for any value of @xmath57 and numerical results for fixed @xmath110 become less accurate .    in fig.[fig :",
    "struct ] we plot the valence quark distribution @xmath93 for a weakly ( @xmath102 , solid line ) and for a strongly bound state ( @xmath112 , dashed line ) .",
    "we have used @xmath105 and the distributions are normalized such that the area below the curve is unity . for the weakly bound system ,",
    "the valence quark distribution has a peak , if quark and diquark masses such as @xmath113 are used . ] around @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution becomes flat for the strongly bound system .",
    "this behavior however turns out to be mainly of kinematic origin , since the distribution function is given by an integral over the squared momentum @xmath25 carried by the struck quark with integration bounds from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , where @xmath117 this kinematical bound determines the global shape of @xmath93 to a large extent .",
    "we have solved a bse for a nucleon , described as a bound state of a quark and diquark within a covariant quark  scalar - diquark model .",
    "we have extracted the physical quark - diquark vertex function when the diquark is on  mass  shell from the euclidean solution .",
    "the vertex function obtained was applied to a diquark spectator model for dis , and the valence quark contribution to the structure function @xmath93 was calculated .",
    "we found that the shape of the unpolarized valence quark distribution is mainly determined by relativistic kinematics and is independent of the detailed structure of the vertex function .",
