    "the jellium model of a metal surface , introduced by bardeen in 1936 ,  @xcite is the simplest model which reproduces qualitatively , and sometimes quantitatively , the physical properties of real metal surfaces .",
    "@xcite while in his work bardeen applied an approximated hartree - fock ( hf ) theory for the study of the electronic structure , since the seminal work of lang and kohn ( lk )  @xcite the standard theoretical tool applied to the study of the electronic structure of metal surfaces has been density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "@xcite as in the original work of lang and kohn , most of the subsequent investigations have applied the local - density approximation ( lda ) of dft , or some of its semi - local variants ( gga , meta - gga , etc . ) .",
    "this approach has been highly successful , and routinely yields good results for global surface properties such as work functions , surface energies , crystal - structure relaxation and reconstruction , etc .",

    ", this potential decays exponentially when evaluated in the vacuum region , instead of the expected image - like @xmath7 behavior .",
    "@xcite this qualitative failure of the lda _ xc _ potential translates to a similar failure of the position - dependent _ xc _ energy per particle , @xmath10 , which is defined through  @xcite @xmath11 = \\int n({\\bf r } ) \\ ; \\varepsilon_{xc } ( { \\bf r } ) \\ ; d{\\bf r } , \\label{definition}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 $ ] being the _ xc_-energy contribution to the universal energy functional of dft , and @xmath13 representing the electron density .",

    "( 1 ) is not unique .",
    "one can always add to @xmath10 an arbitrary function @xmath18 with the condition that weighted by the electron density @xmath13 integrates to zero .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath10 to represent the interaction between a given electron at @xmath14 and its _ xc _ hole .",
    "the goal of this work is to provide exact analytical and numerical calculations of the exact - exchange @xmath19 for jellium slabs and the semi - infinite ( si ) jellium .",
    "in particular , we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the exact @xmath20 in the vacuum region far away from the surface , and we find that there is a qualitative difference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 : both exhibit an image - like behavior of the form @xmath23 , but with a coefficient @xmath24 that while in the case of jellium slabs is universal and equal to 1/2 in the case of a semi - infinite jellium depends on the density of the bulk material and only approaches 1/2 in the low - density limit .",
    "the results reported here should help to settle the still controversial issue of the asymptotic behavior of the position - dependent _ xc _ energy per particle and ks _ xc _ potential at metal surfaces .",
    "@xcite    besides , being the results presented here exact at the exchange level , they should also serve as a benchmark against to which dft _ xc _ calculations could be confronted , and hopefully improved , once reduced to their exchange - only version . in this context , very recently luo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have used a hf scheme to report self - consistent calculations of the surface energy and work function of jellium slabs .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the general theoretical background for both jellium slabs and the semi - infinite jellium , and we derive exact analytical expressions for the position - dependent exchange energy per particle in the vacuum region far away from the surface .",
