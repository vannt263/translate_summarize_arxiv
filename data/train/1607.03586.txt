    ", there has been an observed gap between the fundamental limit and the dipolar response coefficients from numerical optimizations as well as a larger gap between the fundamental limit and those coefficients determined experimentally from real molecules.@xcite many new strategies have been employed by researchers in recent years to bridge both of these gaps such as using monte carlo simulations to optimize mechanical potentials,@xcite studying quantum graphs as nonlinear optical materials that correlate the topology to the response,@xcite placing prongs on nanowires and conjugated molecules that cause a phase disruption,@xcite using conjugation as a means to scale molecules and increase the linear and nonlinear coefficients,@xcite and synthesizing twisted molecules.@xcite    investigators have recently proposed the necessity for more exotic hamiltonians due to the gap between the numerical simulations and the fundamental limit.@xcite it was previously shown using the relativistically corrected thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule @xcite that the fundamental limits to the nonlinear - optical coefficients were smaller than the nonrelativistic limits due to the inclusion of higher - order momentum operators reducing the total oscillator strength.@xcite the space - fractional schrdinger equation @xcite has a kinetic energy term that acts on the spatial coordinates via the riesz fractional derivative.@xcite the canonical momentum acts as a fractional derivative operator on functions of position which changes the commutation relations and suppresses the net oscillator strength .",
    "the limit derived from the standard schrdinger equation is used to define the apparent intrinsic hyperpolarizability to compare the hyperpolarizablity from the fractional schrdinger equation with standard systems in linear space . because the limit to the hyperpolarizability from the fractional schrdinger equation depends on the fractionality of space , it is shown to be more appropriate to study the apparent intrinsic hyperpolarizability .",
    "some applications of the fractional schrdinger equation to fundamental physics have previously been investigated such as calculations of the observed baryon spectrum at low energy,@xcite an analytical model for ground - state band spectra of even - even nuclei,@xcite liquid helium in nanoporous media,@xcite and superfluids in capillary tubes as realizations of probability transport of relativistic particles.@xcite the results from this study could be used to validate and fine tune the parameters of some proposed applications of the fractional schrdinger equation via the sensitivity of nonlinear processes to dimensionality .",
    "the nonlinear optical response of a system described by the fractional schrdinger equation has yet to be considered .",
    "studying the sensitivity of the hyperpolarizability to the degree of spatial fractionality gives new insights to the observed response of quantum systems with space - fractional operators .",
    "the fractional schrdinger equation was first derived sixteen years ago by laskin through a generalization of the path integral formulation via a lvy - type stochastic motion.@xcite the space - fractional schrdinger equation for a single particle is given as @xmath0 where the fractional hamiltonian is @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the wavefunction , @xmath3 is the energy , @xmath4 is the rest mass , and @xmath5 is the potential . the parameter @xmath6 is real with @xmath7 corresponding to the standard schrdinger equation .",

    "note that there are several definitions of the fractional derivative which are all correct for the range of order over which they are defined . for fractional derivatives that are of positive order and less than one ,",
    "the fractional derivative definitions are typically denoted as left- and right - sided derivatives .",
    "this notation for the direction is based on the integer value at the extreme of the derivative s range , where the first - order derivative is an odd operator . for finite difference calculations of differential equations ,",

    "this central difference approximation ensures symmetry of the laplace operator and preserves hermiticity .",
    "likewise , fractionalizing the second - order derivative using the riesz definition also preserves the hermiticity regardless of whether the riesz fractional derivative is given in integral or differential form .",
    "it is well - known that the nonlinear optical coefficients for a system subject to a static field can be determined via time - independent perturbation theory of the standard schrdinger equation.@xcite likewise , the nonlinear response to a static field of a space - fractional quantum system may also be determined via time - independent perturbation theory .",

    "a similar strange behavior of the limit to the hyperpolarizability under the three - level ansatz has also been observed for systems with relativistic kinetic energies .",
    "here , the hyperpolarizability was also derived from the trk sum rule under the three - level ansatz , where many additional parameters are introduced from higher - order momentum operators in the kinetic energy via the foldy - wouthuysen transformation .",

    "when @xmath22 is larger than unity ( @xmath80 ) , regardless of being an integer value , the canonical momentum depends on the kinetic momentum to a power greater than unity ; however a definition of the fractional differential operator different from the riesz definition is necessary to describe the phenomena .",
    "several new definitions of higher - order fractional derivatives have recently been introduced based on finite differences.@xcite these definitions are based on the highest integer derivative associated with the upper bound of @xmath22 . for example , for a fractional derivative @xmath81 with a range of @xmath82 , the definition is based on the finite difference form of @xmath83 , which is not symmetric .",
    "likewise , the definition of the fractional derivative with range @xmath84 is based on the central difference of @xmath85 , which is an even operator resulting in a hermitian matrix for real @xmath86 .",
    "thus , we would expect that space - fractional systems generalizing the one - dimensional standard schrdinger equation to have momentum operators than never exceed @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , it follows that the fractional laplace operator resulting from the @xmath87 kinetic energy term must be described by a fractional differential operator based on the integer operator of second order , which places an upper bound on the range of the fractional parameter .",
    "if a system is described by a higher - order fractional derivative , then it most likely stems from a kinetic energy term that is not a generalization of the classical kinetic energy .",
    "the hyperpolarizability of asymmetric potentials is non - zero , and unlike the polarizability , its strength is sensitive to intermediate transitions . to satisfy the asymmetry of the system , two half potentials were chosen with a single bound particle .",

    "note that the potential increasingly scales in @xmath86 as @xmath22 decreases due to the speed of light being taken as the inverse of the fine structure constant .",
    "arbitrary constants can also be used to preserve the dimensions of the fractional schrdinger equation that adjust this scaling without affecting the intrinsic response .",

    "the hyperpolarizability is more sensitive to the value of @xmath22 than the polarizability , where even a small deviation from unity causes a significant decrease in the nonlinear response .",
    "note that this sensitivity to @xmath22 is minimized in the particle - centric view , where moving the origin in either direction away from @xmath99 will cause the polarizability and hyperpolarizability to decrease at an even faster rate as @xmath22 moves away from unity .",
