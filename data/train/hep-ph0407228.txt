    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) are basic ingredients in the description of hard exclusive processes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "not only are they generalizations of the well known parton distributions from inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , but being correlation functions they also incorporate non - trivial behavior of hadrons related to the nonperturbative regime of quantum chromodymanics ( qcd ) . at present , apart from the preliminary studies of lattice qcd  @xcite , one can not calculate gpds from first principles , so one has to resort to models or parametrizations .",
    "in fact , the perturbative approach to qcd is able to connect observables at different resolution scales , but the realization of the complete project ( i.e. to fully understand the consequences of the dynamics of quarks and gluons ) requires the input of unknown nonperturbative matrix elements to provide absolute values for the observables at any scale . in the present paper",
    "we intend to apply a radiative parton model procedure which , starting from a low resolution scale @xmath0 , has been able to reproduce and predict ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) the main features of the experimental deep inelastic structure functions at high momentum transfer .",
    "the procedure assumes that there exists a scale where the short range ( perturbative ) part of the interaction is negligible and , therefore , the glue and sea are suppressed , and a long range ( confining ) part of the interaction produces a proton composed by ( three ) valence quarks , mainly  @xcite .",
    "jaffe and ross  @xcite proposed to ascribe the quark model calculations of matrix elements to that hadronic scale @xmath0 . in this way ,",
    "quark models summarizing a great deal of hadronic properties may substitute for low - energy parametrizations , while evolution to larger @xmath1 is dictated by perturbative qcd .    in the following",
    "we study the nucleon s gpds within specific hadron models and address the problem of evolving the input distributions to the experimental scale investigating the effects of different dynamical assumptions .",
    "in particular , we want to investigate both the quark core structure of the nucleon and its chiral properties .",
    "in fact , the new aspects of the gpds with respect to the better known parton distributions are related to the socalled erbl region where the presence of dynamical @xmath2 pairs , both in the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes , plays a crucial role .    the importance of the chiral structure of nucleons is well established both experimentally and theoretically . the pion cloud associated with chiral symmetry breaking",
    "was first discussed in the dis context by feynman  @xcite and sullivan  @xcite .",
    "it leads to flavor symmetry violations in the sea - quark distribution of the nucleons  @xcite , naturally accounting for the excess of @xmath3 ( anti)quarks over @xmath4 ( anti)quarks as observed experimentally through the violation of the gottfried sum rule  @xcite . as discussed by melnitchouk _",

    "@xcite , the relatively large asymmetry found in these experiments implies the presence of nontrivial dynamics in the proton sea which does not have a perturbative qcd origin .",
    "in particular , a quantitative description of the entire region of the quark momentum fraction @xmath5 covered by the experiments requires a delicate balance between several competing mechanisms . at larger @xmath5 the dynamics of the pion cloud provides the bulk of the @xmath6 asymmetry with dis from the @xmath7 component of the nucleon wave function , however also the @xmath8 arises in the light - cone formulation of the meson - cloud model and it is of some importance in dis too .",
    "although the nucleon s nonperturbative antiquark sea can not be attributed entirely to its virtual meson cloud  @xcite , the role of mesons in dis is of primary importance , and the idea was developed further giving origin to the meson - cloud model ( for a review of early work , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the connection between this model and the chiral properties of qcd was established by investigating the nonanalytic behavior of the @xmath6 distribution  @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "the meson - cloud picture is also suggested by qcd in the limit of large numbers of colors @xmath9 , where it becomes equivalent to an effective theory of mesons , in which baryons appear as solitons , i.e. classical solutions characterized by a mean meson field  @xcite .",
    "a realization of this idea is achieved in the chiral quark - soliton model , where the effective action is derived from the instanton vacuum of qcd , thus providing a microscopic mechanism for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "flavor asymmetry of the antiquark distributions arises in this model of the nucleon as a sub - leading effect in the limit of large @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to investigate the role of @xmath2-pairs in dis and to access the erbl region , is considering the constituent quarks as complex systems  @xcite .",
    "such a scheme has been recently developed in relation to a nonrelativistic constituent quark model , both for parton distributions  @xcite and gpds  @xcite .    in the present work we will study the possibility of integrating meson - cloud model effects into the evolution of gpds . to this end",
    "we will assume that gpds can be written in terms of double distributions  @xcite , involving a given profile function and the forward parton distribution derived in some model .",

    "after evolution up to @xmath160 gev@xmath137 gpds are almost confined into the erbl region with a significant @xmath21 dependence .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with previous studies of the gpd evolution showing that as the resolution scale increases the distributions are swept from the dglap domain to lie fully within the erbl region  @xcite .",
    "functions with support entirely in the time - like erbl region @xmath161 are never pushed out of the erbl domain .",
    "in fact , the evolution in the erbl region depends on the dglap region , whereas the dglap evolution is independent of the erbl region .",
    "the same gpds obtained when the input is implemented with the sea according to the meson - cloud model , i.e. @xmath162 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qp - cloud ] ) , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : otto ] .",
    "now , the gluon gpd does no more vanish at the initial hadronic scale , that has to be redefined at @xmath163 gev@xmath137 according to the conclusion of sect .",
    "[ sect : match ] .",
    "after evolution the qualitative result is similar to the case without the sea in spite of a more evident @xmath21 dependence of the singlet quark gpd at the input hadronic scale .",
    "however , the shape of the non - singlet quark gpd around @xmath164 is sensitive to the input , and the @xmath21 dependence of the gpds size is in general less pronounced .",
    "results have been presented for qcd evolution up to @xmath160 gev@xmath137 .",
    "this is already a value where gpds have reached a stable configuration with respect to their asymptotic shape . in fact , the largest effects of evolution modify the input gpds within the first few gev@xmath137 in the @xmath1 evolution , as can be seen in figs .  [",
    "fig : tred1]-[fig : tred3 ] , where the singlet quark , non - singlet quark and gluon distributions are plotted at @xmath165 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "a similar behaviour has been also found for the valence @xmath166 gpd in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results discussed till now have been obtained with the usual choice @xmath167 and @xmath49 ( compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : profile ] ) and the discussion of sect .",
    "[ sect : gpds - dd ] ) .",
    "it is known  @xcite that in the dd - based model gpds around @xmath168 depend on forward densities at @xmath169 , with a special sensitivity to the sea quark density .",
    "this is particularly critical when using @xmath54 and @xmath170 taken from the global parton analyses  @xcite because their singular behavior at @xmath171 is responsible for a substantial and unrealistic enhancement of the quark singlet gpd relative to parton density in the dglap region at @xmath168 . in the model adopted here",
    "this singularity does not occur .",
    "nevertheless , introducing the sea has nonnegligible effects on the size of the erbl response , especially for the gluon distribution , as can be appreciated by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : undici ] , where the same curves for @xmath172 from figs .",
    "[ fig : sette ] and [ fig : otto ] are directly compared .    the value of the parameter @xmath44 in the profile function @xmath173 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : profile ] ) , determines its width and has been shown to be inversely related to the enhancement of the singlet quark gpd  @xcite . in principle",
    ", one could choose @xmath44 varying from the adopted values up to infinity , with a dirac - delta - like width and quark gpds reducing to parton densities .",
    "the @xmath44 dependence of gpds in the dd - based model including the sea contribution according to the meson - cloud model is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : buno ] and [ fig : bdue ] for @xmath172 and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "only the erbl region is affected by the choice of @xmath44 . at the input hadronic scale",
    "the @xmath44 dependence is strong , increases with @xmath21 and affects all gpds , not only the non - singlet quark gpd .",
    "nlo evolution greatly reduces such a @xmath44 dependence , and a similar behaviour is found for the evolution of gpds also at lo .    as a final remark",
    "let us discuss the validity of our evolution procedure .",
    "as already mentioned the evolution has been performed by using a code due to freund and mcdermott and modified to restore the correct nlo coupling constant thorough the transcendental equation ( [ 0:10 ] ) ( see discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "the modification plays a crucial role when the evolution starts from low hadronic input as in the present investigation . with the caveat that perturbative stability can be tested only at the level of physical cross sections or observables like the unpolarized structure function @xmath175 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : lonlo1 ] the results of lo and nlo evolution for singlet , nonsinglet and gluon distributions up to @xmath160 gev@xmath137 starting from a hadronic scale as low as @xmath163 gev@xmath137 ( where sea contributions are included ) . in the the singlet and nonsinglet sectors , the results at lo and at nlo are quite close , showing that the evolution is clearly under control and converging .",
    "similar results hold also in the case of the evolution of gpds from the lower scale of @xmath176 gev@xmath137 , without the sea contribution .",
    "only the gluon distribution shows larger discrepancy between lo and nlo evolution .",
    "this is not a drawback of our model as can be seen from analogous results of ref .",
    "@xcite which make use of the standard ( grv98 )  @xcite parametrization for the diagonal partonic input at @xmath177 gev@xmath137 , comparable with our input scale .",
    "in fact , it is well known that also in the case of parton distribution functions generated from low scale parametrizations , nlo gluons are affected by renormalization scale dependence , a problem not yet addressed for gpds and deserving further investigation .",
    "different inputs at the hadronic scale have been considered in the qcd evolution of gpds to study sensitivity of the results to the nonperturbative nature of the low - scale hadronic structure . in particular ,",
    "the meson - cloud model was assumed to include sea quarks in the partonic content at the hadronic scale . matching the sea and gluon distributions with the valence - quark distributions derived in a relativistic cqm ,",
    "one starts evolution with continuous functions all over the range @xmath178 . from the results presented here we can draw the following conclusions .    as already noticed in previous analyses  @xcite , evolution in the dglap region",
    "is not much sensitive to the input .",
    "the reason is twofold . at large @xmath26",
    "the valence contribution dominates at the input hadronic scale and , as the scale increases , the distributions are swept from the dglap domain to lie entirely in the erbl region .",
    "in addition , evolution never pushes the input distributions from the erbl to the dglap region which then evolves independently of the erbl input .",
    "in contrast , the erbl region is rather sensitive to the input including or not the sea .    due to the mixing between singlet and gluon distributions in the evolution equations ,",
    "even with a vanishing gluon distribution at the hadronic scale one obtains a significant gluon gpd in the erbl region after evolution , peaked around @xmath179 .",
    "the peak height depends on the input and is higher when the sea is included .",
    "the present results focus on the erbl region as the most interesting one to look at the nonperturbative effects surviving evolution .",
    "this is suggesting that one has to investigate suitable processes under appropriate kinematic conditions to study such effects .",
    "an analysis of possible observables is in progress .",
    "we are grateful to a. freund and m. mcdermott for providing us with their evolution code .",
