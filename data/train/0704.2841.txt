    "energy is often a scarce commodity in wireless sensor networks , as wireless sensors typically operate on batteries , which in many cases are hard to replace .",
    "similarly , due to cost consideration , nodes in wireless ad hoc sensor networks are commonly equipped with only a single omnidirectional antenna .",
    "thus , in order to transmit information over long distances while conserving energy and maintaining a certain transmission power threshold , multihop networks have been the preferred solution .",
    "however , there are several challenges in transmitting real - time services over multiple hops .",
    "for example , the traditional csma / ca based media access control for avoiding collisions does not work well in a multihop scenario because transmitters are often out of reach of other users sensing range .",
    "thus , as packets travel across the network , they experience interference and a large number of collisions , which introduces delays . also , multihop networks require a high node density which makes routing more difficult and affects the reliability of links @xcite .",
    "recently , a collaborative beamforming technique was proposed in @xcite , in which randomly distributed nodes in a network cluster form an antenna array and beamform data to a faraway destination without each node exceeding its power constraint .",
    "the destination receives data with high signal power .",
    "beamforming with antenna arrays is a well studied technology ; it provides space - division multiple access ( sdma ) which enables significant communication rate increase .",
    "the main challenge with implementing beamforming based on randomly distributed nodes in the network is that the geometry of the network changes dynamically .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that such a distributed antenna array can achieve a nice average beampattern with a narrow main lobe and low side lobes .",
    "the directivity of the pattern increases as the number of collaborating nodes increases .",
    "such an approach , when applied in the context of a multihop network reduces the number of hops needed , thereby reducing packet delays and improving throughput .",
    "however , one must take into account the overhead required for node collaboration , i.e. , sharing of the information to be transmitted jointly by the nodes .",
    "if a time - division multiple - access ( tdma ) scheme were to be employed , the information - sharing time would increase proportionally to the number of nodes involved in the collaboration .",
    "in this paper we present a technique based on the idea of collaborative beamforming , that reduces the time required for information sharing .",
    "the technique also allows different nodes in the network to transmit simultaneously .",
    "collaborating nodes receive linear mixtures of the transmitted packets .",
    "subsequently , each collaborating node transmits a weighted version of its received signal .",
    "the weights are such that one or multiple beams are formed , each focusing on one destination node , and reinforcing the signal intended for a particular destination as compared to the other signals .",
    "each collaborating node computes its weight based on the channel coefficients between sources and itself , estimated by orthogonal node ids embedded in the packets .",
    "the proposed scheme achieves higher throughput and lower delay with the cost of lower sinr as compared to @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume that the sources and destinations are coplanar .",
    "we index source nodes using a subscript @xmath0 with @xmath1 denoting the @xmath2-th node .",
    "the locations of these nodes follow a uniform distribution over a disk of radius @xmath3 and it is assumed that each node knows its own location .",
    "we denote the location of @xmath1 in polar coordinates with respect to the center of the disk by @xmath4    suppose that a set of @xmath5 nodes designated as collaborating nodes have access to the same signal , i.e. , @xmath6 , whose destination is at azimuthal angle @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the distance between the @xmath2-th collaborating node and the destination .",
    "the initial phases at the collaborating nodes are set to @xmath9 which requires knowledge of distances relative to wavelength between nodes and destination , and applies to the closed - loop case @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the initial phase of node @xmath2 could be : @xmath10 which requires knowledge of the node s position relative to some common reference point , and corresponds to the open - loop case @xcite . in both cases synchronization",
    "is needed , which can be achieved via the use of the global positioning system ( gps ) .",
    "the channels between collaborating nodes and destination are assumed to be idential for all nodes .",
    "the corresponding array factor given the collaborating nodes at radial coordinates @xmath11 $ ] and azimuthal coordinates @xmath12 $ ] is @xmath13    under far - field assumptions , the array factor becomes @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the following pdf : @xmath18 finally , the average beampattern can be expressed as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the first - order bessel function of the first kind . when plotted as a function of @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 exhibits a main lobe around @xmath7 , and side lobes away from @xmath7 .",
    "it equals one in the target direction , and the sidelobe level approaches @xmath23 as the angle moves away from the target direction .",
    "the statistical properties of the beampattern were analyzed in @xcite , where it was shown that under ideal channel and system assumptions , directivity of order @xmath5 can be achieved asymptotically with @xmath5 sparsely distributed sensors .",
    "as we have noted , all of the collaborating nodes must have the same information to implement beamforming .",
    "thus , the active nodes need to share their information symbols with all collaborating nodes in advance .",
    "if a time - division multiple - access ( tdma ) scheme were to be employed , the information - sharing time would increase proportionally to the number of active nodes . in the following ,",
    "we propose a novel scheme to reduce the information - sharing time and also allow nodes in the network to transmit simultaneously .",
    "here we refine the model of @xcite , focusing more directly on the physical models for the signal , fading channel and noise . besides the assumptions in section [ back ]",
    ", we will further assume the followings :    \\(1 ) the network is divided into clusters , so that nodes in a cluster can hear each other .",
    "in each cluster there is a node designated as the cluster - head ( ch ) .",
    "nodes in a cluster do not need to transmit their packets through the ch .",
    "\\(2 ) a slotted packet system is considered , in which each packet requires one slot for its transmission .",
    "perfect synchronization is assumed between nodes in the same cluster .",
    "\\(3 ) nodes operate under half - duplex mode , i.e. , they can not receive while they are transmitting .",
    "\\(4 ) nodes transmit packets consisting of psk symbols having the same variance @xmath24 .",
    "each transmitted packet contains ( in fixed locations ) a set of pilots comprising the user i d , followed by a set of pilots comprising the destination information .",
    "\\(5 ) communication takes place over flat fading channels . the channel gain during slot @xmath25 between source @xmath1 and collaborating node @xmath26",
    "is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "it does not change within one slot , but can change between slots .",
    "the gains @xmath28 follows a rayleigh fading model , being i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian random variables with zero means and variances @xmath29 .",
    "\\(6 ) the complex baseband - equivalent channel gain between nodes @xmath30 is @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance between nodes @xmath33 and where @xmath34 is the path loss",
    ". the distances between collaborating nodes and destinations are much greater than distances between source and collaborating nodes .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is assumed to be identical for all collaborating nodes and equals the path loss between the origin of the disk over which the nodes are distributed to the destination .",
    "\\(7 ) the noise vectors are uncorrelated , complex , zero - mean white gaussian vectors .",
    "suppose that cluster @xmath35 contain @xmath36 nodes . at slot @xmath25 ,",
    "nodes @xmath37 need to communicate with node @xmath38 that belong to cluster @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal angle of destination @xmath40 is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "the packet transmitted by @xmath42 consists of @xmath43 symbols @xmath44 $ ] . due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel , non - active nodes in cluster @xmath35",
    "hear a collision , i.e. , a linear combination of the transmitted symbols .",
    "more specifically , node @xmath45 hears the signal @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] is noise vector with variance @xmath48 at the receiving node @xmath45 .",
    "once the ch establishes that there has been a transmission , it initiates a collaborative transmission period ( ctp ) , by sending to all nodes a control bit , e.g. , @xmath49 , via an error - free control channel .",
    "the ch will continue sending a @xmath49 in the beginning of each subsequent slot until the ctp has been completed .",
    "the cluster nodes can not transmit new packets until the ctp is over .",
    "suppose that each transmitted packet includes an i d sequence , so that ids are orthogonal between different users .",
    "the channel coefficients can be estimated by cross correlating @xmath50 with known user ids as in @xcite . if the magnitude of the cross - correlation in greater than some threshold , then the corresponding user is in the mixture , and the value of the cross - correlation provides the corresponding channel coefficient .",
    "the information of destination nodes could be obtained in a similar way .",
    "each node @xmath45 uses cross - correlation operations with known orthogonal user ids to determine which users are in the mixture , the corresponding destinations , and also the coefficients @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the destination of @xmath52 . in slot @xmath53 ,",
    "each collaborating node @xmath45 transmits the signal : @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the distance between user @xmath2 and destination node @xmath51 with azimuth @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a scalar to adjust transmit power and same for all collaborating nodes . in addition",
    ", @xmath57 is of the order of @xmath23 .    given the collaborating nodes at radial coordinates @xmath11 $ ] , azimuthal coordinates @xmath12 $ ] and the path loss @xmath34 , the received signal at direction @xmath21 is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the noise vector with variance @xmath60 at the receiver during slot @xmath61 .",
    "let us consider the received signal at the destination @xmath51 at angle @xmath56 during slot @xmath61 : @xmath62 + \\bv_m(n+m)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "also , @xmath65 , due to the fact that for @xmath66 , the channel coefficients @xmath67 are uncorrelated and have zero mean . finally , as @xmath63 and omitting the noise , @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the destination node @xmath51 receives a scaled version of @xmath52 .",
    "the beamforming step is completed in @xmath69 slots , reinforcing one source signal at a time .",
    "assuming that all of the @xmath69 source packets have distinct destinations at different resolvable directions , multiple beams can be formed in one slot , each beam focusing on one direction and reinforcing one source signal .",
    "the transmitted signal from each collaborating node would be : @xmath70 the received signal at destinations would then be : @xmath71 it can be shown that as @xmath63 and omitting noise , @xmath72 , for @xmath73 .",
    "thus , each of the @xmath69 beams transmits a scaled version of a source signal to its destination . based on ( [ rec ] ) , ( [ mulrec ] ) , we can easily extend the mathematical formulation to the scenario that not all of the @xmath69 packets have distinct destinations .    in the rest of the paper , for simplicity we will consider only the case in which a single beam is formed during slot @xmath61 , focusing on destination @xmath51 .",
    "the results obtained under this assumption can be readily extended to multiple simultaneous beams . the time index can be omitted without causing confusion . also , we are particularly interested in the average properties over a statistical ensemble , so the analysis can be based on one sample of a packet assuming samples are independent . substituting @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 in ( [ crec])-([rec ] ) by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 (",
    "i.e. , with one of their samples ) respectively , we get : @xmath84",
    "[ sec : avgbeam ] in this section we analyze the average beampattern . under the far - field assumption , and following the steps in @xcite , ( [ recnew ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the same as those in ( [ 100 ] ) .",
    "the far - field beampattern or the received power is defined as : @xmath88    taking into account the assumptions on the channel coefficients , it can be readily shown that the average beampattern equals : @xmath89 + \\sigma_v ^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , @xmath90 where @xmath91    the term @xmath92 represents the average power of the sidelobes that is independent of the angle @xmath21 .",
    "note that ( [ avgbeampattern ] ) is of the similar form with ( [ 101 ] ) .",
    "thus , other properties of the average beampattern like peak / zero positions and 3-db bandwidth / sidelobe region can be easily obtained based on corresponding results of @xcite , and are omitted here .",
    "suppose that @xmath69 packets need to be transmitted",
    ". for the collaborative beamforming scheme of @xcite , each packet must be shared by the @xmath5 beamforming nodes .",
    "if one wished to avoid collisions , tdma would be a natural way to implement information sharing . with the use of tdma , in each slot one active node",
    "is scheduled to broadcast its packet to other nodes within the same cluster .",
    "the sharing of information would require @xmath69 slots . via the use of multiple beams ,",
    "the beamforming to the destination would require @xmath49 slot if destinations are distinct , or up to @xmath69 slots in the worst case where all nodes have the same destination .",
    "thus , for the scheme of @xcite , the throughput , @xmath93 satisfies : @xmath94 .    in the proposed scheme ,",
    "combinations of @xmath69 packets enter the system and reach @xmath5 collaborating nodes in @xmath49 slot . via multiple beams ,",
    "the packets can be delivered to their destinations in one additional slot , if the destinations are distinct .",
    "the throughput is then @xmath95 .",
    "if two or more packets have a common destination , the beamforming will need to take more than one slot . in the worst case where all packets have the same destination ,",
    "@xmath69 slots will be needed , resulting in a total throughput of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , @xmath97 .",
    "note that the throughput of the proposed scheme could be greater than 1 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the sinr under the same transmit power for the scheme of @xcite and the proposed scheme .",
    "although the focus in @xcite was on the statistical properties of the beampattern , we can extend ( [ 100])-([101 ] ) to a physical model including signal , path loss and noise .",
    "the received signal of the destination @xmath51 is given by : @xmath98    @xmath45 simply transmits @xmath99 , and the transmit power is thus @xmath100 .",
    "the average beampattern at the target direction @xmath56 is : @xmath101 and the sinr is @xmath102    for the proposed scheme , the collaborating node @xmath45 transmits @xmath103 given by ( [ trans ] ) . it can be shown the average power of @xmath103 equals @xmath104 where @xmath105 .    to keep the same average transmit power as @xmath100 , @xmath106 under this value of @xmath57 and",
    "based on ( [ avgbeampattern ] ) , the average beampattern at @xmath56 is given by @xmath107    thus , the average received power of the proposed scheme ( without the noise term @xmath60 ) is @xmath108 times less than that of ( [ 202 ] ) .",
    "in other words , each collaborating node in the proposed scheme needs to use @xmath108 times more transmit power , in order to ( asymptotically ) achieve the same average received power as ( [ 202 ] ) .    from ( [ avgbeampattern ] ) , ( [ 204 ] ) , ( [ 205 ] ) , ( [ 203 ] ) ,",
    "the sinr at the destination @xmath51 for the proposed scheme is @xmath109    thus , compared with ( [ 204 ] ) , the average sinr of the proposed scheme at the destination is still asymptotically scaled down by @xmath108 .",
    "we investigate the performance of the above scheme for different numbers of collaborating nodes , i.e. @xmath5 . for convenience , and without loss of generality , we divide the nodes in a cluster into two pools : one contains all potential active nodes , the total number of which is fixed @xmath110 = 32 and another contains @xmath5 collaborating nodes . the directions of destinations are uniformly distributed in @xmath111 .",
    "the locations of collaborating nodes are uniformly distributed within a disk with @xmath112 ( i.e. , the radius normalized by the wavelength ) .",
    "the channels among nodes in a cluster are selected from zero - mean complex gaussian processes , which are constant within one slot , but vary between slots .      in the proposed scheme , noise enters the collaborating nodes , with variance @xmath48 , and the destination , with variance @xmath60 .",
    "let us define @xmath113 which represents the average snr in the process of information sharing , and define @xmath114 .",

    ", we perform a random experiment consisting of 1,000 repeated independent trials . in each trial , all users are statistically the same , and each user sends out packets with probability @xmath121 .",
    "the throughput is defined as the average number of packets that were successfully transmitted in a time slot .",
    "each packet contains 424 bits with qpsk symbols .",
    "the nodes i d sequences are selected based on a @xmath110th order hadamard matrix and the ids are used to determine the active nodes involved in collisions as well as to estimate the channels .",
    "a maximum likelihood decoder is used at the destination nodes to recover the symbols .",
    "packets received at the destinations with ber higher than 0.02 are considered to be lost or corrupted . @xmath122",

    "[ fig2 ] ( a)-(c ) , we show the throughput performance for different values of @xmath120 and @xmath5 , allowing up to 1 , 2 , 3 simultaneous beampatterns per slot , respectively . the curves with legend `` ideal '' correspond to the case where all the transmitted packets are successfully received , which can be considered to be an upper bound on the proposed scheme .",
    "one can see that the increase of @xmath5 can result in throughput improvement .",
    "furthermore , for small @xmath5 , one should choose a small number of simultaneous beampatterns to improve throughput .",

    "an analysis for the average beampattern and network performance has also been provided .",
