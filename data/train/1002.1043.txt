    "<S> an increase of both magnitudes with the number of valence electrons is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the shell structure is reflected by the behavior of the statistical complexity . </S>",
    "<S> the magic numbers are indicated by the fisher - shannon information . </S>",
    "<S> so , as in the case of atomic nuclei , the study of statistical indicators also unveil the existence of magic numbers in metal clusters .    and    statistical indicators ; metal clusters ; shell structure ; magic numbers    nowadays </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of information - theoretic measures on quantum systems has received a special attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the application of these indicators to atoms or nuclei reveals some properties of the hierarchical organization of these many - body systems @xcite . in particular , entropic products such as fisher - shannon information and statistical complexity present two main characteristics when applied to the former systems . on one hand </S>",
    "<S> , they display an increasing trend with the number of particles , electrons or nucleons . on the other hand , they take extremal values on the closure of shells . moreover , in the case of nuclei , the trace of magic numbers is displayed by these statistical magnitudes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> metal clusters are useful quantum systems to understand how the physical properties evolve in the transition from atom to molecule to small particle to bulk solid @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . they also present a shell structure where it can applied the statistical indicators before mentioned . as in the case of atoms and nuclei , the fractional occupation probabilities of valence electrons in the different orbitals can capture the shell structure . </S>",
    "<S> this set of probabilities can be used to evaluate the statistical quantifiers for metallic clusters as a function of the number of valence electrons . </S>",
    "<S> similar calculations have been reported for the electronic atomic structure @xcite and for nuclei @xcite . in this work , by following this method , we undertake the calculation of statistical complexity and fisher - shannon information for metal clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> the jellium model provides an accurate description of some simple metal clusters . in this model , a valence electron </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to interact with the average potential generated by the other electrons and the ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement potential in the schrdinger equation leading to shell structure is taken as a potential intermediate between the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator and the three - dimensional square well . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a filling of shells with a number @xmath0 of valence electrons given by the series : 2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 34 , 40 , 58 , 68 , 70 , 92 , 106 , 112 , 138 , 156 , 166 , 168 , 198 , 220 and so on . </S>",
    "<S> each shell is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 counts the number of levels with that @xmath2 value , and @xmath5 is the number of valence electrons in the shell , @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> as an example , we explicitly give the shell configuration of a metal cluster formed by @xmath7 valence electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is obtained : @xmath8 the fractional occupation probability distribution of electron orbitals @xmath9 , @xmath10 , being @xmath11 the number of shells , can be defined in the same way as it has been done for calculations in atoms and nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this normalized probability distribution @xmath9 @xmath12 is easily found by dividing the superscripts @xmath5 by the total number @xmath0 of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> then , from this probability distribution , the different statistical magnitudes ( shannon entropy , disequilibrium , fisher information , statistical complexity and fisher - shannon entropy ) can be obtained .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we undertake the calculation of entropic products , a statistical measure of complexity @xmath13 and the fisher - shannon entropy @xmath14 , that result from the product of two statistical quantities , one of them representing the information content of the system , and the other one giving an idea of how far the system is from the equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the classical indicator of information is the shannon entropy , that in the discrete version is expressed as @xmath15 any monotonous function of @xmath16 can also be used for this purpose , such as the exponential shannon entropy @xcite , @xmath17 or @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the indicator of how much concentrated is the probability distribution of the system can be related with some kind of distance to the equilibrium distribution , that in our case is the equiprobability . </S>",
    "<S> the disequilibrium @xmath19 given by @xmath20 and the fisher information @xmath21 by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , are two useful parameters in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> then , the statistical measure of complexity , @xmath13 , the so - called lmc complexity @xcite , is defined as @xmath24 and the fisher - shannon information @xcite , @xmath14 , is given by @xmath25    the statistical complexity , @xmath13 , of metal clusters as a function of the number of valence electrons , @xmath0 , is given in fig . [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> . we can observe in this figure that this magnitude fluctuates around an slightly increasing average value @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is also found for the electronic structure of atoms @xcite and for the shell structure of nuclei @xcite , reinforcing the idea that in general complexity increases with the number of units forming a system . </S>",
    "<S> however , the shell model supposes that the system encounters certain ordered rearrangements for some specific number of units ( electrons or nucleons ) that coincide with closed shells . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> this fact is reflected by the notable increase of @xmath13 in the metal clusters with one valence electron more than those with closed shells , which are indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , just as happens for atoms when one electron is added to noble gases or when one nucleon is added to a closed shell in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> observe that some major shells do not show local minima at their closing . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is due to the number of valence electrons belonging to each shell : a shell with a few valence electrons displays a local minimum of @xmath13 when is closed , but this is not the case when the number of valence electrons in a shell increases .    </S>",
    "<S> the fisher - shannon entropy , @xmath14 , of metal clusters as a function of @xmath0 is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it presents an increasing trend with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the spiky behavior of @xmath13 provoked by the shell structure is still present for @xmath14 but becomes smoother in this case . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 displays notable peaks only at a few @xmath0 related with the filling of some major shells , concretely at the numbers @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it must be remarked that , similarly as happens with @xmath13 , the maximum values of @xmath14 are taken on the nuclei with one unit more than the former series , although now the difference is slightly appreciable . </S>",
    "<S> only peaks at @xmath27 and @xmath28 disagree with the sequence of magic numbers \\{2 , 8 , 18 , 20 , 34 , 40 , 58 , 92 , 138 , 198 } obtained from experimental data , for instance , for @xmath29 clusters @xcite and for @xmath30 clusters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us observe that the magic numbers are basically marked by the fisher information such as it can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the statistical complexity @xmath13 and the fisher - shannon information @xmath14 with the number of valence electrons in metal clusters has been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing trend of these magnitudes with the number of valence electrons , @xmath0 , has been found . </S>",
    "<S> the method that uses the fractional occupation probabilities has been applied to calculate these statistical indicators . as in the case of atoms and nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> the shell structure is well displayed by the spiky behavior of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath14 shows an smoother behavior but with relevant peaks just on the major shells that coincide with the series of magic numbers in metal clusters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the qualitative study of metal clusters by means of statistical indicators unveil certain physical properties of them . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , we can conclude that this type of statistical measures is able to enlighten some conformational aspects of quantum many - body systems . </S>"
