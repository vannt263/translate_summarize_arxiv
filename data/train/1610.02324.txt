    "in this paper , our goal is to present a broad generalization of the hoffmann - jrgensen inequality ( see theorem  [ thj ] ) .",
    "this is a classical result in the literature , which is widely used in bounding sums of independent random variables , with several different versions proved in the general setting of a separable banach space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall a `` first version '' from the literature :    [ thjlt ] suppose @xmath1 is a separable banach space , and @xmath2 is a probability space with @xmath3 independent random variables . for @xmath4 , define @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ". then , @xmath7    this version incorporates results by kahane @xcite and hoffmann - jrgensen @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for a detailed history of the inequality . )",
    "theorem  [ thjlt ] has seen subsequent generalizations by several authors , including johnson and schechtman [ _ ann .",
    "_  17 ] , klass and nowicki [ _ ann .",
    "prob . _  28 ] , and hitczenko and montgomery - smith [ _ ann",
    "this last variant is now stated :    [ thm](notation as in theorem  [ thjlt ] . ) for all @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10    while isoperimetric methods provide more powerful techniques to work with , the aforementioned manifestations of the hoffmann - jrgensen inequality for banach spaces also have numerous consequences in estimating the magnitude and behavior of the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as explained in @xcite , for instance .",
    "we now present several motivations behind the present note .",
    "first , our main result in theorem  [ thj ] provides an improvement on theorems  [ thjlt ] and  [ thm ] above .",
    "note , theorem  [ thm ] has a variant via the order statistics of the variables @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our result improves on this strengthening as well .",
    "second , it is not clear if either of theorems  [ thjlt ] or  [ thm ] follows from the other , or if they are even logically related .",
    "our result ( theorem  [ thj ] ) simultaneously unifies and significantly generalizes both of these results .",
    "a third motivation arises out of independent mathematical and applied interest .",
    "note that to state the above inequalities , one requires merely the notions of a metric and a binary associative operation .",
    "thus a question of interest is to ascertain whether the result holds in the more general setting of a separable metric semigroup @xmath14 ( defined below ) .    in this paper , we provide a positive answer to the above question .",
    "thus we show theorem  [ thj ] in the minimal mathematical setting required to state the hoffmann - jrgensen inequality .",
    "our motivations in so doing are both modern as well as traditional .",
    "classically , a cornerstone of twentieth - century probability theory has been the systematic and rigorous development of the field , for random variables taking values in banach spaces . at the same time , general results on fourier analysis and haar measure for compact abelian groups , and the study of random variables with values in metric groups @xcite motivate the need to develop results in the greatest possible generality .",
    "the present paper lies squarely in this area .",
    "additionally , an increasing number of modern - day settings involve working outside the traditional banach space paradigm .",
    "indeed , settings of compact and abelian lie groups are studied in the literature , including permutation groups , lattices and other discrete ( semi)groups , circle groups and tori . moreover ,",
    "modern data are manifold - valued  including in real / complex lie groups  as opposed to the traditionally well - studied normed linear spaces .",
    "other modern settings include the space of graphons with the cut - norm @xcite , as well as the space of labelled graphs @xmath15 on a fixed vertex set @xmath16 , which was studied in @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath15 turns out to be a @xmath17-torsion group and hence can not embed as a subgroup into a normed linear space .",
    "thus , banach space methods are not adequate to study stochastic phenomena in modern - day settings . to this end , this paper allows for studying tail estimates and bounding random sums in greater generality .",
    "we now set some notation and state our main result .    a _ metric semigroup _",
    "is defined to be a semigroup @xmath18 equipped with a metric @xmath19 that is translation - invariant : @xmath20    equivalently , @xmath21 is a metric space equipped with a associative binary operation @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is translation - invariant .",
    "metric ( semi)groups are ubiquitous in probability theory .",
    "examples include banach spaces such as function spaces , discrete semigroups ( including finite groups as well as labelled graph space @xmath15 @xcite ) , and all compact or abelian lie groups , which include the circle and tori ( via e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem v.5.3 ) ) . among other examples",
    "are amenable groups ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.12 ) and the discussion around it ) and abelian hausdorff metrizable topologically complete groups @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath24 is a separable metric semigroup , with borel @xmath25-algebra @xmath26 .",
    "given integers @xmath27 and random variables @xmath28 , define @xmath29    where @xmath30 is arbitrary .",
    "( we show below , @xmath31 is independent of @xmath30 . )",
    "we now state our main result , namely , the aforementioned generalization of the hoffmann - jrgensen inequality , for separable metric semigroups .    [ thj ]",
    "suppose @xmath24 is a separable metric semigroup , @xmath32 are fixed , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are independent .",
    "also fix integers @xmath35 and nonnegative scalars @xmath36 , and define @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes the kronecker delta . now if @xmath39 , then : @xmath40    more generally , define @xmath41    so that @xmath42 are the order statistics of the @xmath43 .",
    "then the above inequality can be strengthened by replacing @xmath44 by @xmath45    theorem  [ thj ] generalizes the original hoffmann - jrgensen inequality in many ways : mathematically it is a significant generalization of theorem  [ thjlt ] ( which itself generalizes the classical hoffmann - jrgensen inequality for euclidean , hilbert , and banach spaces ) . to see this , set @xmath46    now theorem  [ thjlt ] follows from theorem  [ thj ] with @xmath47",
    "moreover , theorem  [ thj ] also generalizes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ",
    "i.e. , theorem  [ thm ]  which has different bounds than theorem  [ thjlt ] . to see this , set @xmath48 .",
    "now the first expression on the right - hand side of equation can be rewritten as follows : @xmath49    thus with the above values , theorem  [ thm ] follows from theorem  [ thj ] : @xmath50    second , in @xcite it is not shown whether or not the variant of the hoffmann - jrgensen inequality ( theorem  [ thm ] ) can be reconciled with theorem  [ thjlt ] .",
    "our result achieves this goal , thus unifying and simultaneously generalizing variants from the literature , including by johnson and schechtman @xcite , klass and nowicki @xcite , and hitczenko and montgomery - smith @xcite .",
    "finally , theorem  [ thj ] does not require a norm , group structure , commutativity , or completeness , but is valid in the primitive mathematical setting of separable metric semigroups .",
    "thus , the result is a significant generalization of the original inequality by hoffmann - jrgensen .",
    "in order to prove theorem  [ thj ] , we first study basic properties of metric semigroups @xmath14 . we begin with the _ triangle inequality _ in @xmath14 , which is straightforward , and used without further reference .    @xmath51    we also require the following lemma , which provides a workaround for the `` norm '' in a metric semigroup , when there is no identity element .    given a metric semigroup @xmath24 , and @xmath52 , @xmath53    is independent of @xmath54 .",
    "compute using the translation - invariance of @xmath23 : @xmath55    now we show the main result of the paper .",
    "our proof follows in part the argument in @xcite ; however , we are able to streamline some of the steps and provide novel techniques that help generalize the result to its present form . for convenience ,",
    "the proof is divided into steps",
    ".    * step 1 . *",
    "define @xmath56 , and given @xmath57 , let @xmath58 if @xmath59 . also define @xmath60    now if @xmath61 , then it is clear that @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the inequality is strengthened by replacing @xmath44 by @xmath63 .",
    "( note that this strengthening of the inequality was originally suggested in the setting of banach spaces by rudelson in @xcite . )",
    "now set @xmath64 .",
    "then , @xmath65    thus , we will restrict ourselves to @xmath66 .",
    "define @xmath67 , and let @xmath68 be the smallest integer such that @xmath69 .",
    "note that such an @xmath70 exists because @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "* step 2 . * for this step , fix @xmath72 . in this step",
    "we inductively define integers @xmath73    as follows : @xmath74 is as above , and given @xmath75 for @xmath76 , define @xmath77 to be the least integer @xmath78 such that @xmath79 .",
    "to do so , we first _ claim _ that such an integer @xmath77 exists for all @xmath57 .    to show this claim ,",
    "suppose to the contrary that such an @xmath77 does not exist ( for the smallest such @xmath76 ) .",
    "then for all @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "we now make the _ sub - claim _ that @xmath82    notice that the sub - claim contradicts the fact that we are restricted to @xmath72 , thereby proving the claim .",
    "thus , it suffices to show the sub - claim .",
    "to do so , we consider various cases : if @xmath83 , then @xmath84 , so we are done .",

    "the above analysis in this step proves the claim about the existence of @xmath96 , for all @xmath72 .",
