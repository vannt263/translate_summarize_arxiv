    "the parameters we call `` constants of nature '' may in fact be variables related to the local values of certain dynamical fields .",
    "for example , what we perceive as a cosmological constant could be a potential @xmath1 of some slowly varying field @xmath2 .",
    "if this potential is very flat , so that the evolution of @xmath3 is much slower than the hubble expansion , then observations will not distinguish between @xmath1 and a true cosmological constant .",
    "observers in different parts of the universe could then measure different values of @xmath1 .",
    "spatial variation of the fields @xmath4 associated with the `` constants '' can naturally arise in the framework of inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of light scalar fields during inflation are strongly influenced by quantum fluctuations , so different regions of the universe thermalize with different values of @xmath4 .",
    "an important question is whether or not we can predict the values of the `` constants '' we are most likely to observe . in more general terms",
    ", we are interested in determining the probability distribution @xmath5 for us to measure certain values of @xmath4 .",
    "the answer to this question must involve anthropic considerations to some extent .",
    "the laws of physics may be sufficient to determine the range and even the spacetime distribution of the variables @xmath4 .",
    "however , some values of @xmath4 which are physically allowed may be incompatible with the very existence of observers , and in this case they will never be measured .",
    "the relevant question is then how to assign a weight to this selection effect .",
    "the inflationary scenario implies a very large universe inhabited by numerous civilizations that will measure different values of @xmath4 .",
    "we can define the probability @xmath6 for @xmath4 to be in the intervals @xmath7 as being proportional to the number of civilizations which will measure @xmath4 in that interval @xcite .",
    "this includes all present , past and future civilizations ; in other words , it is the number of civilizations throughout the entire spacetime , rather than at a particular moment of time . assuming that we are a typical civilization , we can expect to observe @xmath4 near the maximum of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the assumption of being typical has been called the `` principle of mediocrity '' in ref.@xcite .",
    "an immediate objection to this approach is that we are ignorant about the origin of life , let alone intelligence , and therefore the number of civilizations can not be calculated .",
    "but even if this were true , the approach can still be used to find the probability distribution for parameters which do not affect the physical processes involved in the evolution of life .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath8 , the density parameter @xmath9 and the amplitude of density fluctuations @xmath10 are examples of such parameters . assuming that our fields @xmath4 belong to this category , the probability for a civilization to evolve on a suitable planet is then independent of @xmath4 , and instead of the number of civilizations we can use the number of habitable planets or , as a rough approximation , the number of galaxies .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of galaxies that are going to be formed in regions where @xmath4 take values in the intervals @xmath13 .",
    "the probability distribution ( [ 1 ] ) based on plain galaxy counting is interesting in its own right , since it gives a quantitative characterization of the large scale properties of the universe .",
    "thus , the general rules for calculating ( [ 1 ] ) are worth investigating quite independently from anthropic considerations .",
    "these considerations can always be included a posteriori , as an additional factor giving the number of civilizations per galaxy .    the number of galaxies @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is proportional to the volume of the comoving regions where @xmath4 take specified values and to the density of galaxies in those regions .",
    "the volumes and the densities can be evaluated at any time , as long as we include both galaxies that were formed in the past and those that are going to be formed in the future .",
    "it is convenient to evaluate the volumes and the densities at the time when inflation ends and vacuum energy thermalizes , that is , on the thermalization surface @xmath15",
    ". then we can write @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is proportional to the volume of thermalized regions where @xmath4 take values in the intervals @xmath7 , and @xmath18 is the number of galaxies that form per unit thermalized volume with cosmological parameters specified by the values of @xmath4 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath18 is a standard astrophysical problem which is completely unrelated to the calculation of the volume factor @xmath19 , and which does not pose difficulties of principle .",
    "= 10 cm +    the meaning of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is unambiguous in models where the total number of galaxies in the universe is finite .",
    "otherwise , one has to introduce some cutoff and define the ratio of probabilities for the intervals @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the ratio of the galaxy numbers @xmath22 in the limit when the cutoff is removed .",
    "however , this limiting procedure has proved to be rather non - trivial , and a general method which would apply to all possible eternally inflating scenarios has not yet been found .",
    "the situation is relatively straightforward in the case of an infinite universe which is more or less homogeneous on very large scales .",
    "one can evaluate the ratio @xmath22 in a large comoving volume @xmath23 and then take the limit as @xmath24 .",
    "the result is expected to be independent of the limiting procedure ; for example , it should not depend on the shape of the volume @xmath23 .",
    "( it is assumed that the volume selection is unbiased , that is , that the volume @xmath23 is not carved to favor some values of @xmath4 at the expense of other values . )",
    "however , the situation with an infinite universe which is homogeneous on very large scales is not generic in the context of inflation .",
    "most inflationary scenarios predict that inflation is eternal to the future , and therefore the universe is never completely thermalized @xcite ( for a recent review of eternal inflation see @xcite ) .",
    "an example which is particularly relevant to the subject of the present paper is given by the double well inflaton potential depicted in fig .",
    "the inflaton @xmath25 can thermalize in two different vacua , labeled by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the spacetime distribution of the field in this model is depicted in fig .",
    "there are thermalized regions of two types , characterized by the inflaton vacuum expectation value @xmath28 .",
    "thermalized regions with @xmath29 are disconnected from thermalized regions with @xmath30",
    ". both types of regions are separated by inflating domain walls @xcite , and so the universe is never completely thermalized .",
    "each thermalization surface is infinite , so it will contain an infinite number of galaxies . moreover , there are an infinite number of thermalized regions of each type . therefore , the implementation of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) for calculating probabilities requires the comparison of infinite sets of galaxies which lie in disconnected regions of the universe .",
    "a similar spacetime structure is obtained if we make the inflaton potential periodic by identifying the two minima . in this case",
    "there are still two different types of thermalization surfaces , characterized by the two topologically different paths that one can take from the top of the potential to the thermalized region .",
    "although the particle physics parameters of both types of thermalized regions are guaranteed to be the same , other cosmological parameters such as the spectrum of density perturbations or the spatial distribution of an effective cosmological constant will in general be different .",
    "= 10 cm +    in any model of eternal inflation , the volumes of both inflating and thermalized regions grow exponentially with time and the number of galaxies grows without bound , even in a region of a finite comoving size .",
    "one can try to deal with this problem by introducing a time cutoff and including only regions that thermalized prior to some moment of time @xmath31 , with the limit @xmath32 at the end .",
    "one finds , however , that the resulting probability distributions are extremely sensitive to the choice of the time coordinate @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "coordinates in general relativity are arbitrary labels , and such gauge dependence of the results casts doubt on any conclusion reached using this approach .",
    "a resolution of the gauge dependence problem was proposed in ref.@xcite and subsequently developed in @xcite .",
    "the proposed method can be summarized as follows .",
    "let us first assume that inflating and thermalized regions of spacetime are separated by a single thermalization surface @xmath15 .",
    "the problem with the constant - time cutoff procedures is that they cut the surface @xmath15 in a biased way , favoring certain values of @xmath3 and disfavoring other values .",
    "we thus need a portion of @xmath15 selected without bias .",
    "the simplest strategy is to use a `` spherical '' cutoff .",
    "choose an arbitrary point @xmath34 on @xmath35 . define a sphere of radius @xmath36 to include all points",
    "@xmath10 whose distance from @xmath34 along @xmath15 is @xmath37 .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) to evaluate the probability distribution @xmath38 in a spherical volume of radius @xmath39 and then let @xmath40 . if the fields @xmath4 vary in a finite range , they will run through all of their values many times in a spherical volume of sufficiently large radius .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the distribution @xmath5 will rapidly converge as the cutoff radius @xmath39 is increased .",
    "we expect also that the resulting distribution will be independent of the choice of point @xmath34 which serves as the center of the sphere .",
    "the same procedure can be used for fields with an infinite range of variation , provided that the probability distributions for @xmath4 are concentrated within a finite range , with a negligible probability of finding @xmath4 very far away from that range .",
    "suppose now that there is an infinite number of disconnected thermalization surfaces , as it happens generically in eternal inflation .",
    "further , we assume that the variables @xmath4 of interest are such that their whole range of values is allowed to occur in a single thermalized region ( this is the case , for instance , for the slowly varying field @xmath3 which plays the role of a cosmological constant ) , and that , unlike the case of the double well potential in fig .  1 , there is only one type of thermalized region .",
    "we can then pick an arbitrary connected component of @xmath15 and apply the spherical cutoff prescription described above . since the inflationary dynamics of the fields @xmath4 have a stochastic nature",
    ", the distributions of @xmath4 on different connected components of @xmath15 should be statistically equivalent , and the resulting probability distribution @xmath5 should be the same for all components .",
    "this has been verified both analytically and numerically in @xcite .",
    "the main shortcoming of the spherical cutoff prescription is that as it stands it can not be applied to models where the inflaton potential has a discrete set of minima , as in the example shown in fig .  1 .",
    "more precisely , the problem arises when the minima are separated by inflating domain walls @xcite . in this case",
    ", we can introduce a discrete variable @xmath41 labeling different minima .",
    "each connected component of the thermalization surface @xmath15 will be characterized by a single value of @xmath41 ( unless the different minima can be separated by non - inflating domain walls ) and it is clear that the probability distribution for @xmath41 can not be determined by studying one such component .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a generalization of the spherical cut - off prescription that would be applicable in the general case .",
    "we begin in section ii by formulating the requirements that we believe any such proposal should satisfy .",
    "we require that it should be gauge - independent and should reduce to the spherical cutoff prescription in the absence of discrete variables .",
    "moreover , we consider a class of asymmetric double - well potentials for which the probabilities can be calculated in a well - motivated way .",
    "we then require that the general prescription should give the same result for this class of potentials . in section iii",
    "we propose a prescription that satisfies all of the above requirements .",
    "we use this prescription in section iv to calculate probabilities for bubble universes in open inflation scenario .",
    "our conclusions are summarised and discussed in section v.",
    "suppose that the inflaton potential has @xmath42 minima labeled by @xmath43 , so that there are @xmath42 different types of thermalized regions .",
    "suppose also that there is a set of scalar fields @xmath4 which take a continuous range of values in all types of thermalized regions .",
    "our goal is to calculate the probability distribution @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the normalized distribution for @xmath3 within @xmath41-th type of thermalized region , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the probability for an observer to find herself in a thermalized region of type @xmath48 .",
    "we begin with the obvious requirements that the probabilities ( [ pn ] ) should be gauge - invariant and should satisfy the normalization condition @xmath49    next , we require that for @xmath50 the prescription should reduce to the spherical cutoff prescription .",
    "this implies that the spherical cutoff should be used for the calculation of the individual distributions @xmath45 within each type of thermalized region .",
    "what remains to be determined are the relative probabilities of different types of regions , @xmath47 .",
    "= 10 cm +    finally , we introduce a class of inflaton potentials for which we believe there is a well - motivated answer for the probabilities . consider first a symmetric double - well potential , @xmath51 , with a maximum at @xmath52 and two minima at @xmath53 , as in fig .  1 .",
    "clearly , in this case the symmetry of the problem dictates that @xmath54 .",
    "next , we consider an asymmetric double - well , which however _ is _ symmetric in some range of @xmath25 near the maximum , @xmath55 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "quantum fluctuations of @xmath25 dominate the dynamics in the range @xmath56 , while for @xmath57 the evolution is essentially deterministic .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath58 is in the deterministic slow - roll regime , @xmath59 .",
    "let us consider constant-@xmath25 surfaces @xmath60 .",
    "these are infinite spacelike surfaces which have @xmath55 everywhere in their past . since the potential @xmath61 is symmetric in this range of @xmath25 , all these surfaces are statistically equivalent .",
    "the symmetry of the problem suggests that the probabilities @xmath62 can be calculated by sampling comoving spheres of equal radius on the two types of surfaces .",
    "the ratio of the probabilities will then be @xmath63 where @xmath64 are average numbers of galaxies that will form in large comoving spherical regions which have equal radii at @xmath65 .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the two types of regions have identical physics at thermalization and afterwards , then the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 can only be due to the different inflationary expansion factors @xmath68 characterizing the evolution from @xmath69 to the thermalization points @xmath70 .",
    "we then have @xmath71 and @xmath72 we shall require that the general prescription for probabilities should reproduce eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) in the case of asymmetric double - well potentials of the type we discussed here .",
    "in the general case , the inflaton potential has no symmetries to guide our selection of the equal-@xmath25 surfaces on which to calculate probabilities .",
    "suppose the potential has a maximum , which we choose to be at @xmath52 , and two minima with thermalization points at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we can then choose some arbitrary values @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the slow roll ranges of @xmath25 adjacent to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , and calculate the probabilities by sampling the surfaces @xmath77 .",
    "imagine for a moment that the number of thermalized regions of both types and the number of galaxies in each region are all finite",
    ". then we could write @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the probability for a randomly selected thermalized region to be of type @xmath48 and @xmath80 is the average number of galaxies in a type-@xmath48 region . in our case , however , the number of thermalized regions and the number of galaxies in each region are infinite , so the definitions of the probabilities @xmath79 and of the ratio @xmath81 are problematic .    it has been remarked @xcite that the problem of determining @xmath79 is similar to the problem of calculating the probability @xmath82 that a randomly selected integer is even . if we take a long stretch of the natural series @xmath83 it will have nearly equal quantities of even and odd numbers , suggesting that @xmath84 .",
    "however , the series can be reordered as @xmath85 and the same calculation would give @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that by appropriately ordering the series one can obtain any answer for @xmath82 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this seems to suggest that the probabilities @xmath79 are hopelessly ill - defined .",
    "we note , however , that the situation with the natural series is not as bad as it may seem .",
    "the series has a natural ordering in which the nearest neighbors of each number differ from that number by 1 , and we can require that our sampling procedure should respect this natural `` topology ''",
    ". then we have @xmath84 , which is the answer that one intuitively expects . with an infinite number of thermalized regions of different types",
    ", one could also order the list of regions in a way that would give any desired result for @xmath89 .",
    "but again one can hope that this ambiguity can be removed if we require that our sampling procedure should reflect the spatial distribution of the regions .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 can be calculated by counting galaxies in spheres located in regions of the two types . in the double - well example of section ii",
    ", there is complete symmetry between the surfaces @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we expect , therefore , that @xmath92 and we choose the radii of the spheres to be equal at @xmath60 . however , it is not clear what sets the relative size of the spheres in the absence of symmetry .",
    "we shall now describe the method we propose for evaluating @xmath79 and @xmath81 in the general case .",
    "we start by noting that there is one thing that thermalized regions of the two types have in common . in their past",
    "they all went through a period of stochastic inflation , with the inflaton field @xmath25 undergoing a random walk near the top of the potential .",
    "our idea is to use some markers from this early era for the calculation of probabilities .",
    "let us imagine that markers are point objects and that they are produced at a constant rate per unit spacetime volume in inflating regions where @xmath93 is at the top of its potential , @xmath94 .",
    "after that , the markers evolve as comoving test particles and eventually end up in a thermalized region of one type or the other .",
    "we shall define @xmath79 as the fraction of markers that end up in regions of type @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , the reference length scale on which the number of galaxies is counted in a region of type @xmath48 will be set by the average distace @xmath95 between markers in that type of region .",
    "in other words , the galaxies are counted in spheres of radii @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath98 . to summarize",
    ", we propose that the relative probabilities for the constants of nature are given by ( [ pn ] ) with @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mean number density of markers in region of type @xmath48 and @xmath101 , given by @xmath102 is the mean density of galaxies in that type of region .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the calculation of @xmath101 is a standard astrophysical problem which we shall not be concerned with in this paper . a physical counterpart to the production of our idealized markers is quantum nucleation of black holes in an inflating universe .",
    "black holes are produced at a rate @xcite @xmath103 $ ] which grows exponentially with @xmath61 , so that by far the highest rate is achieved at @xmath104 . here",
    ", we prefer not to identify markers with black holes and to think of them as of idealized point objects .",
    "this frees us from concerns such as the contribution to black hole production from regions which are not at the top of the potential , black hole evaporation , etc .",
    "the reality and observability of markers is not really an issue , since the comparison of causally disconnected thermalized regions is certainly a gedanken experiment .",
    "the average comoving distance between the markers in a thermalized region is manifestly gauge invariant , and so is the ratio @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ proposal ] ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath79 are also gauge - independent , and thus the probabilities @xmath47 in ( [ proposal ] ) should be gauge - invariant .",
    "it is also easy to verify that the above proposal gives the expected result ( [ simple ] ) for the probabilities when the inflaton potential is symmetric in the diffusion range of @xmath25 . in this case , the average distance between markers on the surface @xmath90 is the same as that on @xmath91 ( with @xmath106 defined in section ii ) .",
    "hence , the distances between markers at thermalization may differ only due to the difference in the expansion factors from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , @xmath107 and eq.([simple ] ) follows immediately .",
    "as an illustration of the method we shall now calculate probabilities for a model of `` open inflation '' @xcite .",
    "we assume an inflaton potential of the form shown in fig .",
    "4 . it has a metastable false vacuum at @xmath52 which is separated by potential barriers from two slow roll regions on the left and on the right .",
    "the false vacuum decays through bubble nucleation , and the inflaton rolls towards the true vacuum inside the bubbles .",
    "comoving observers inside each bubble would , after thermalization of the inflaton , see themselves in an open homogeneous universe .",

    "if the bubble nucleation rate is not too high , bubble collisions are rare and inflation is eternal . assuming that the two types of bubbles have identical low - energy physics , we would like to find the probability for an observer to find herself in one type of bubble or the other .    in false vacuum regions outside bubbles",
    "the metric is de sitter , @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the false vacuum energy density .",

    "if the initial bubble size is much smaller than the de sitter horizon @xmath112 , then the wall worldsheet is well approximated by the future light cone of the center of spacetime symmetry of the bubble .",
    "we shall choose coordinates so that this center is at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "then , at sufficiently small values of @xmath120 , the metric ( [ rw ] ) inside the bubble is close to the open de sitter metric , @xmath121 .",

    "the density of markers @xmath123 satisfies the equation @xmath124 which has a stationary solution @xmath125 .",

    "the thermalized volume @xmath160 in an eternally inflating universe is dominated by the newly thermalized regions ( shortly before the time @xmath33 ) , and the density of markers in these regions is generally correlated with the choice of the time variable @xmath33 .",
    "the density of markers on the surfaces @xmath164 can vary greatly from one area to another . in some places",
    "the field @xmath25 takes a more or less direct route from the top of the potential to @xmath70 , resulting in a relatively high density of markers , while in others it takes a long time fluctuating up and down the potential , so that the markers are greatly diluted . by including only regions that thermalize prior to time @xmath33 ,",
    "we `` reward '' regions that thermalize faster and therefore introduce a bias favoring higher densities of markers .",
    "this qualitative tendency is present for most choices of the time variable , but quantitatively the bias will not be the same .",
    "hence , one should not be surprised that @xmath95 calculated from eq.([dt ] ) would depend on the choice of gauge .    despite this gauge dependence",
    ", the fp method may give approximately valid results for some class of models .",
    "it has been argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that in the case of @xmath154-prescription the gauge dependence is rather weak for a wide class of potentials .",
    "one can expect the situation to be similar for our new method when a constant @xmath33 cutoff is used . however , more work is needed to determine what additional requirements the potential should satisfy for this approximate gauge independence to apply .",
    "we started in section ii of this paper by formulating a set of requirements which we believe any method for calculating the probabilities should satisfy .",
    "the specific prescription we introduced in section iii can be regarded as an `` existence proof '' , demonstrating that a prescription satisfying all the criteria can indeed be constructed .",
    "it is quite possible , however , that our prescription is not unique and that more attractive and better motivated methods can be developed . with this in mind",
    ", we conclude by indicating some possible shortcomings and limitations of our method .",
    "admittedly , our prescription includes an element of arbitrariness when we assume that markers are produced only in regions where the inflaton @xmath25 is at the top of its potential .",
    "this `` @xmath165-function '' source should not be understood literally .",
    "the semiclassical picture of eternal inflation involves smearing over spacetime scales @xmath166 and over scalar field intervals @xmath167 .",
    "hence , marker formation at the top of the potential is equivalent to marker formation within an interval @xmath168 from the top of the potential .",
    "however , an attempt to extend marker formation to a wider interval encounters some ambiguities .",
    "formally , there is no problem in calculating the density @xmath169 of markers in thermalized regions even if these are produced at some given rate @xmath170 per unit proper time and volume in regios where the field is in the range @xmath171 .",
    "however , there is an obvious arbitrariness in what should be chosen as our `` smearing function '' @xmath172 .",
    "also , if markers are produced at different rates at different values of @xmath173 , the calculation of the fraction of markers @xmath79 that end up in region @xmath48 becomes somewhat ill posed .",
    "markers formed at different values of @xmath25 will have a different probability @xmath79 of ending up in a type-@xmath48 region and it is not clear how to weigh the different contributions .",
    "one could calculate @xmath174 and then average over @xmath25 with some weight , but it is not clear how the weight function is to be determined .",
    "it thus appears that confining marker formation to the top of the potential has some advantages and may be not as arbitrary as it first seems .",
    "it is not clear whether or not our method will give reasonable results when applied to the most general type of inflationary scenarios , when the inflaton potential has several local maxima .",
    "additional complications arise in models where the minimum of the potential has a non - vanishing cosmological constant . in such models , regions of true vacuum in the post - inflationary universe",
    "may fluctuate back to the quantum diffusion range of the inflaton potential and the spacetime structure is more complicated than the one represented in fig .  2 .",
    "also , our method is not applicable when the potential is unbounded from above , in which case eternal inflation runs into the planck boundary .",
    "this is not particularly worrisome , since after all the inflaton may be a modulus with a compact range , and the inflaton potential may well be bounded from above at a scale much lower than the planck scale .",
