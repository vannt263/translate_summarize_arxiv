    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) theoretically unites the electromagnetic and weak forces of nature .",
    "it postulates that these forces are communicated between the constituent particles of nature , quarks and leptons , by carriers known as gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , the electromagnetic force is carried by the photon , @xmath1 , while the weak force is mediated by the neutral @xmath2-boson , @xmath3 , and the charged @xmath0-bosons , @xmath4 . as such",
    ", the @xmath0-boson is fundamental to the standard model .",
    "moreover , the mass of the @xmath0-boson , , is a parameter of the theory itself , so that a comparison between the experimentally determined and the sm prediction provides an important and fundamental test of the theory .",
    "alternatively , a precision measurement of  can be used to estimate , within the framework of the sm , other parameters such as the mass of the higgs boson , .",
    "the weak force was first inferred from observations of nuclear @xmath5-decay , @xmath6 . in 1935 , fermi postulated the first theory of weak interactions .",
    "the form of the interaction was taken to be analogous with that of the electromagnetic interaction , and was characterized by a `` coupling '' ( or strength ) parameter  the fermi constant , @xmath7 . by comparing interaction rates , the strength of the weak force was estimated to be about @xmath8 that of the electromagnetic force .",
    "fermi s theory very successfully described low energy weak interactions , but violated unitarity at high energy .    in 1967 glashow , weinberg and salam proposed the electroweak @xmath9 gauge theory , which unifies the weak and electromagnetic forces  @xcite .",
    "the theory postulated that the weak force was mediated by massive particles , the @xmath0- and @xmath2-bosons , and predicted their masses to be of order @xmath10  gev . ]",
    "the discovery of the @xmath0-boson in 1983 , with a mass of @xmath11  gev @xcite , was a great success for the electroweak theory .",
    "more rigorous tests of the theory required more precise determinations of the boson masses .    over the past 15 years a variety of experiments have measured the mass of the @xmath0-boson with ever improving precision .",
    "the first measurements were made at the cern @xmath12 collider  @xcite by the  @xcite and  @xcite experiments .",
    "the  experiment made the first measurement of the @xmath0-boson mass at a relative precision below @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the  @xcite and  @xcite experiments at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite , another @xmath14 collider , were the first to push the precision to the @xmath15 level .",
    "more recently , measurements made at the cern @xmath16-collider , lep , by the  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite experiments , have also reached relative precisions of @xmath15 . combining all these measurements",
    "yields a relative precision of @xmath17 and affords stringent tests of the standard model .",
    "in particular , due to radiative corrections , such precision measurements offer indirect constraints on the mass of the higgs boson .      in the @xmath9 electroweak theory , local gauge invariance",
    "is achieved by introducing four massless bosons , an isovector triplet @xmath18 , and an isosinglet , @xmath19 . in analogy to the electromagnetic case , the electroweak lagrangian can be expressed as a product of currents and coupling parameters : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the weak isospin and hypercharge currents of the physical fermions (  quarks and leptons ) , respectively , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are their couplings to the @xmath25 and @xmath19 fields .",
    "the weak quantum numbers are related to the electric charge , @xmath26 , by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the third component of the weak isospin associated with the @xmath29 group and @xmath30 is the weak hypercharge associated with the @xmath31 group  @xcite . the fact that the associated bosons are massless implies that the weak field is a long - range ( infinite ) field , in contradiction with experimental evidence .",
    "this short - coming can be addressed by imparting mass to the vector bosons , which is achieved by spontaneously breaking the @xmath9 symmetry with the introduction of an additional field .",
    "demanding that the theory be valid to high energies and remain renormalizable , a necessary condition in order to extract meaningful theoretical predictions , constrains the form of this additional field .",
    "the simplest solution introduces a complex scalar isodoublet , the higgs field , with one component having a vacuum expectation value @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the physical boson fields can then be expressed as @xmath33 for the charged @xmath0-bosons , @xmath4 , the neutral @xmath2-boson , @xmath3 , and the photon , @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the weak mixing angle , @xmath35 , relates the @xmath29 and @xmath31 coupling constants to the electromagnetic coupling constant (  the fine structure constant ) , @xmath36 , by @xmath37 the gauge boson masses are given by @xmath38 corresponding to the massive @xmath39 and @xmath3-bosons and the massless photon , respectively .",
    "equations  [ eq : thetaw ] and [ eq : mwmzma ] yield the following relationship , @xmath40 .    at low energies ,",
    "the electroweak theory is equivalent to the fermi theory of weak interactions .",
    "comparing the electroweak lagrangian in equation  [ eq : ewklagrangian ] to fermi s expression for the weak interaction yields the following equality , @xmath41 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath42 relating the mass of the @xmath0-boson , the mass of the @xmath2-boson , the fine structure constant and the fermi constant , so that a measure of three yields a prediction of the fourth . to obtain theoretical predictions of an precision comparable to that of the experimental determinations of these parameters",
    ", radiative corrections must be included .",
    "these corrections can be incorporated by rewriting equation  [ eqn : ewksmtlevel ] as : @xmath43 where the effects of the radiative corrections are included in the additional term , @xmath44 .",
    "the corrections can be separated into three main pieces , @xmath45 which include the running of the fine structure constant , @xmath46 , a quadratic dependence on the top quark mass , @xmath47 , and a logarithmic dependence on the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "this last dependence is a unique consequence of the non - abelian gauge structure of the electroweak theory , which allows interactions among the gauge bosons themselves .",
    "it is because of these radiative corrections that precision measurements of @xmath7 , @xmath36 ,  and when compared with theoretical calculations , can yield constraints on  and  @xcite .",
    "there have been two @xmath14 colliders with sufficient center - of - mass energy ( @xmath49 ) to produce @xmath0-bosons , the @xmath12   at cern ( @xmath49=630 gev ) and the tevatron at fermilab ( @xmath49=1.8 tev ) .",
    "figure [ fig : wprod ] shows the most important subprocesses for @xmath0-boson production in @xmath14 collisions . at these center - of - mass energies , the dominant subprocess is @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath2-bosons , which form an essential control sample , are produced via analogous processes .",
    "the @xmath0-boson mass measurements from these colliders all make use of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 decay channels .",
    "electrons and muons are easy to trigger on and their momenta can be measured very precisely .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 and @xmath2-bosons are the dominant source of isolated , high-@xmath53 electrons and muons in @xmath14 collisions .",
    "therefore , samples of @xmath0 and @xmath2-decays involving electrons and muons can be identified with very little background .",
    "purely hadronic decays of the @xmath0-boson are swamped by qcd background .",
    "decays involving @xmath54 leptons are difficult to identify because the @xmath54 leptons decay before they enter the detector .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath2 production in @xmath14 collisions are large , @xmath55 pb at @xmath49=630 gev @xcite and 2.3 nb at @xmath49=1.8 tev @xcite for @xmath0-bosons , where @xmath56 is the leptonic branching fraction . for @xmath2-bosons the corresponding values are about 10 times smaller .    in the following ,",
    "we refer to a coordinate system which has its origin at the average @xmath14-collision point .",
    "the @xmath57-axis is defined by the proton beam .",
    "the @xmath58-axis points up .",
    "the @xmath59-axis points along the horizontal .",
    "since the parton center - of - mass frame is boosted along the beam direction , momentum components transverse to the beam are especially important .",
    "they are are denoted by a subscript @xmath60 .",
    "the beams are unpolarized so that there is an inherent azimuthal symmetry .",
    "thus it is often convenient to work in a cylindrical coordinate system in which @xmath61 is the angle with the @xmath59-axis in the @xmath59-@xmath58 plane .",
    "the longitudinal phase space is most conveniently expressed in terms of the pseudo - rapidity , @xmath62 , which is related to the polar angle @xmath63 .",
    "the detectors have approximate azimuthal and forward - backward symmetry .",
    "they are constructed to cover as large a region in pseudo - rapidity as possible . from inside out , they typically consist of several sub - detectors : a tracking system to measure the trajectories of charged particles ; a calorimeter to measure the energy of electrons , photons , and hadrons ; and a muon detection system . the tracking system may be located in a magnetic field to determine the momentum of charged particles from the curvature of their trajectories .",
    "the detectors register the charged lepton from the decay of the @xmath0-boson , while the neutrino escapes without detection .",
    "the initial proton and antiproton break up in the collision and the fragments hadronize , contributing additional particles to the event .",
    "the hadronization of final - state quarks or gluons also contributes particles , which may form jets if the initial parton had sufficient transverse momentum .",
    "we refer to all particles , except the @xmath0-boson and its decay products , as the underlying event .",
    "some of the particles of the underlying event escape through the beam pipe and are not detected at all .",
    "these particles may carry a substantial momentum component along the beam axis , but they carry little momentum transverse to the beam .",
    "the transverse momenta of all final - state particles must add to zero , because the initial @xmath14 momentum is zero and momentum is conserved .",
    "since the undetected neutrino carries away substantial momentum , the transverse momenta of all observed final - state particles do not add to zero .",
    "the apparent transverse momentum imbalance is called `` missing @xmath64 '' .",
    "the particles of the underlying event that fall within the detector acceptance can not all be detected individually .",
    "the detector measures the sum of the energy of all particles incident on one calorimeter segment .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 gives an approximate measurement of the total transverse momentum of all underlying event particles .",
    "the sum runs over all calorimeter cells , except those assigned to the charged lepton .",
    "@xmath66 is the energy in cell @xmath67 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath68 forms a right angle with the beam axis and points from the beam to cell @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the basic observables are the momentum of the charged lepton ( @xmath69 , @xmath70=@xmath71 or @xmath72 ) and the sum of the transverse momenta of the particles in the underlying event ( @xmath73 ) which we call the recoil momentum . from these , the transverse momenta of the @xmath0-boson ( @xmath74 ) and the neutrino ( @xmath75 ) can be inferred . a high-@xmath64 charged lepton and large missing @xmath64 form the characteristic signature of @xmath0-boson decay events .",
    "@xmath2-decay events are characterized by two charged leptons with high @xmath64 .",
    "there are no high-@xmath64 neutrinos in such @xmath2-decays and therefore no significant missing @xmath64 is expected .",
    "it is not possible to reconstruct the invariant mass of the @xmath0-boson because there is no measurement of the momentum component of the neutrino along the beam axis .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-bosons are neither produced at rest nor are they the only particles produced in the collisions .",
    "therefore , a precision measurement of the @xmath0-boson mass using @xmath0-bosons produced in @xmath14 collisions poses a particular challenge .",
    "the most precise measurements of the mass of the @xmath0-boson are based on the transverse mass of the charged lepton - neutrino pair , defined as @xmath76 the advantage of the transverse mass is its invariance under boosts along the beam axis .",
    "boosts transverse to the beam axis only give rise to corrections of order @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse mass depends on the measurement of the recoil momentum @xmath73 and all the associated systematic effects .",
    "an alternative method to determine  uses the @xmath64 spectrum of the lepton .",
    "this has the advantage of being insensitive to @xmath78 .",
    "however , it is affected by the boost of the @xmath0-boson transverse to the beam axis to order @xmath79 and is therefore much more sensitive to systematic effects associated with the production of the @xmath0-bosons .    in principle , the charged lepton momentum or the transverse momentum of the neutrino",
    "can also be used to measure the @xmath0-boson mass .",
    "however the former is sensitive to boosts in all directions and the latter suffers from poor resolution .",
    "these variables serve mainly as cross checks .",
    "it is not possible to describe the spectra of the variables mentioned above analytically .",
    "they have to be calculated numerically using a monte carlo model that takes into account the mechanisms for production and decay of @xmath0-bosons , and detector effects .",
    "the backgrounds to the @xmath80 signal are @xmath81 ( 1 - 2% ) , hadronic backgrounds ( 1% for @xmath51 , @xmath821% for @xmath52 ) , @xmath83 ( @xmath821% for @xmath51 , 4% for @xmath52 ) , and cosmic rays ( @xmath821% ) .",
    "hadronic backgrounds arise hadrons , that fake the charged lepton signature .",
    "@xmath83 decays can enter the @xmath0 sample if one of the leptons escapes detection .",
    "the quoted percentages give the approximate residual fractions of background events in the final @xmath0 samples .",
    "the precise background contamination depends on the details of the event selection and the detector .",
    "they have to be taken into account in the measurement to avoid biasing the result .",
    "the normalization and shapes of the background spectra are determined from control data samples and detailed monte carlo simulations .",
    "the event selection consists of the identification of the charged lepton and a set of kinematic and topological cuts .",
    "the selection criteria have to achieve two competing goals : to reject backgrounds efficiently and to minimize any biases to the selected event sample .",
    "kinematic cuts , requiring the momentum of the charged lepton and missing @xmath64 above a threshold ( typically 25 gev ) , are easy to simulate and reduce backgrounds significantly",
    ". @xmath0-bosons with very high transverse momenta do not add to the statistical significance of the mass measurement , because their transverse mass and lepton @xmath64 spectra are very broad and carry little mass information .",
    "in addition , their recoil response is difficult to simulate and they are subject to higher background contamination .",
    "thus , such events are usually eliminated from the sample by requiring that the @xmath0-boson @xmath64 is below some threshold and/or that there are no high-@xmath64 jets in the events .",
    "an electron is typically identified as an energy deposit in the calorimeter , consistent in shape with an electromagnetic shower , and a track that points to it .",
    "since these electrons are highly relativistic , their momenta can be equated to the energy measured in the calorimeter .",
    "a muon is typically identified as a track stub in the muon detection system that matches a track in the tracking system and energy deposits in the calorimeter , small enough to be consistent with the passage of a minimum - ionizing particle .",
    "these criteria reduce contamination from hadronic backgrounds .",
    "however , both criteria inherently require the lepton to be isolated from other activity in the event .",
    "this biases the selection towards event topologies in which the charged lepton is emitted along the direction of motion of the @xmath0-boson . in such events , the probability is smaller that the lepton overlaps with a recoil particle .",
    "since the boost of the @xmath0-boson increases the lepton @xmath64 in the lab frame , these events tend to have harder charged leptons and softer neutrinos",
    ". this bias does not affect the transverse mass spectrum significantly , but it must be understood to predict the @xmath64 spectra of the charged leptons and the neutrinos correctly .",
    "specific cuts are required to reject events due to an accidental coincidence between a cosmic ray traversing the detector and a beam crossing .      in this section a generic description of the monte carlo models",
    "the sections below , describing the individual measurements , highlight significant experiment specific deviations . to keep statistical fluctuations in the monte carlo simulation negligible",
    ", many millions of @xmath0-decay events have to be generated . to simulate such large event samples , parameterized monte carlo algorithms for @xmath0-boson production and decay , and detector modeling were developed specifically for the @xmath0-mass measurements .",
    "first , the @xmath0-bosons are generated .",
    "their @xmath64 distribution is determined theoretically from qcd - based calculations , empirically from the observed @xmath64 distribution of @xmath2-bosons , or by a combination of both .",
    "the rapidity distribution of the generated @xmath0-bosons depends on the momentum distribution of the partons inside the proton .",
    "to determine it , a specific set of parton distribution functions must be chosen .",
    "the mass distribution of the generated @xmath0-bosons is a relativistic breit - wigner curve with peak at the hypothesized value of the @xmath0-boson mass and @xmath84-dependent width , given by the standard model expectation .",
    "this mass spectrum is skewed towards lower mass values due to the momentum distribution of the partons inside the proton .",
    "next , the @xmath0-bosons are allowed to decay . at lowest order , the angular distribution of the charged leptons is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the scattering angle of the charged lepton in the rest frame of the @xmath0-boson , @xmath87 the charge of the lepton , and @xmath88 the helicity of the @xmath0-boson . in most events the initial quark comes from the proton and @xmath88 equals @xmath89 . in the much less likely case",
    "that the initial antiquark comes from the proton @xmath88 equals @xmath90 .",
    "higher - order qcd processes modify the angular distribution of the leptons .",
    "radiative decays , in which @xmath91 , modify the momentum spectrum of the leptons .",
    "the monte carlo models either include these effects or corrections are applied to the results .",
    "the decay @xmath92 leads to events , that are topologically indistinguishable from @xmath80 .",
    "these can be calculated precisely in the framework of the standard model and are typically included in the monte carlo model .",
    "finally , the monte carlo model must account for detector effects .",
    "the simulation has now generated the  true \" momenta of the @xmath0-boson ( and thus the recoil momentum ) and the charged lepton in the event .",
    "these are modified to account for experimental resolutions , biases , and efficiencies .",
    "adding random gaussian uncertainties to the observables simulates resolution effects .",
    "the widths of these gaussian distributions are parameterized in detector - specific ways .",
    "other effects accounted for include the response of the detector to the charged lepton and to the underlying event .",
    "also modeled are the imperfect separation of energy deposits between lepton and underlying event , which leads to biases in lepton and recoil momentum measurements , and selection efficiencies that depend on kinematics or topology of the events .",
    "events due to the process @xmath93 , @xmath83 constitute an extremely important control sample to determine these effects . comparing the observed @xmath2 peak to the known @xmath2-boson mass",
    "calibrates the energy or momentum response to charged leptons .",
    "the observed width of the @xmath2 peak measures the energy or momentum resolution for charged leptons .",
    "the @xmath2-boson @xmath64 can be measured directly using the charged leptons from its decay and indirectly from the recoil momentum . by comparing both determinations",
    ", the @xmath2 events also serve to calibrate the recoil momentum response of the detector relative to the charged lepton response .",
    "the monte carlo model predicts the shape of the transverse mass and the lepton @xmath64 spectra from @xmath80 decays as a function of the hypothesized value of the @xmath0-boson mass .",
    "these are added to the estimated background spectra and normalized to obtain probability density functions for a maximum likelihood fit to the spectra from the collider data .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in the fit to the @xmath94 spectrum is typically 11 gev/(number of events)@xmath95 .",
    "figures [ fig : mt ] and [ fig : pt ] show representative spectra of transverse mass and lepton @xmath64 .",
    "these spectra were measured by the  experiment .",
    "the points indicate the collider data , the line indicates the monte carlo prediction that agrees best with the data , and the shaded region indicates the estimated background contribution .",
    "all inputs of the monte carlo model contribute to the systematic uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "each such contribution is estimated by varying the input within its 68% confidence interval to determine the resulting change in the measured @xmath0-boson mass .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of all such contributions .",
    "most of the model parameters are constrained by control data samples , most notably by the @xmath83 samples . in most cases",
    "the precision with which these parameters can be determined is limited by the size of the control samples , so that these uncertainties are really statistical in nature .",
    "this means that they can be quantified in a well - defined way .",
    "there are some cases in which no rigorous confidence interval can be defined , as is usually more typical of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the following paragraphs elaborate on the most important categories of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the values quoted for each uncertainty are typical of the measurements from the tevatron using a fit to the @xmath94 spectrum from a data sample of about 100 pb@xmath96 .",
    "lepton energy / momentum scale : : :    ( 70 - 85 mev ) this is the most important systematic effect . since all    detector responses are calibrated against the charged leptons using    the @xmath2 sample , the measured @xmath0 mass simply    scales with the lepton scale .",
    "it can be set in two ways .",
    "+    one method is to calibrate the lepton scale so that the    @xmath97 and @xmath98 mass    peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zee ] ) agree with the known @xmath2-boson mass    @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that the uncertainty is dominated by    statistical fluctuations in the @xmath2 sample ,    @xmath993 gev/(number of events)@xmath95 , and    little extrapolation is needed to the energies of leptons from    @xmath0-decays .",
    "uncertainties in the extrapolation can be    limited by using other resonances , such as    @xmath100 or    @xmath101 .",
    "if the scale calibration of the    charged leptons is tied to the @xmath2-boson mass , the    measured quantity is really the ratio of the @xmath0 and    @xmath2-boson masses , rather than the @xmath0-boson    mass . given that the @xmath2-boson mass is known so precisely ,    the two quantities are of course de facto equivalent .",
    "+    detectors with a magnetic tracking system can alternatively calibrate    the momentum measurement for charged tracks , using for example    @xmath102 decays ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsi ] ) , and then    extrapolate to the momentum of leptons from @xmath0-decays .",
    "the calorimeter must then be calibrated against the track momentum    using the ratios of energy and momentum ( @xmath103 ) measured    for electrons from @xmath0-decays .",
    "the advantage of the latter    method lies in the higher precision of the track momentum calibration .",
    "its disadvantage are the systematic effects associated with the    extrapolation to higher momenta and the effects of radiation on the    @xmath103 spectrum .",
    "lepton energy / momentum resolution : : :    ( 20 - 25 mev ) the electron energy resolution can be modeled as    @xmath104 ,    where @xmath105 is the electron energy ,    @xmath106 the sampling term and    @xmath107 the constant term .",
