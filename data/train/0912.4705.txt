    "the potts model @xcite is one of the most interesting models in statistical mechanics .",
    "it appears as the most natural generalization of the ising model by allowing the spin variable to take more than two distinct values . besides its intrinsic importance in the theory of critical phenomena",
    ", it manifests a number of intriguing relations with many areas of both physics and mathematics ( for nice detailed reviews see @xcite ; for the relation with the problem of color confinement see @xcite ; for its relation with the kohanov homology see @xcite ) .",
    "we will study the @xmath7state potts model at zero magnetic field , whose partition function on an arbitrary graph @xmath8 is , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 spin variables @xmath12 can take values @xmath13 and are located at the vertices of @xmath8 .",
    "there is also an interaction energy @xmath14 for pairs of spins located at the ends of every edge @xmath15",
    ". it will be important for our development to introduce an equivalent expression for the partition function , @xmath16 where the temperature variable @xmath1 has been introduced with @xmath17 .",
    "for the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath18 ) one has @xmath19 corresponding to the temperature interval @xmath20 ; for the antiferromagnetic potts ( @xmath21 ) the interval @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "it can be shown directly from ( [ p_func_2 ] ) that the partition function admits also the following polynomial ( fortuin - kasteleyn ) representation @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a graph with the same vertex set @xmath26 of @xmath8 and an edge set @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the edge set of @xmath8 ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the number of connected components and the number of vertices of @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to notice that using ( [ f - k ] ) one can easily extend @xmath0 and @xmath32 from their physical values ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) to the whole complex plane .    unlike the case of the ising model ( @xmath35 ) , solved by onsager @xcite , the exact solution for the potts model in any infinite two dimensional lattice is still not available",
    "nevertheless , thanks to universality , the critical behavior of the ferromagnetic potts model is fairly well understood . on the other hand ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic potts depends on the structural properties of the lattice and its critical properties can vary strongly from case to case .",
    "thus , the search for tools to obtain analytical information on the free energy of the potts model on generic lattices is a very important task .",
    "an approach that has proven fruitful in recent years is to solve the simpler problem of calculating the partition function for periodic strips of finite width ( @xmath36 ) and arbitrary length ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "previous work along these lines has relied basically on a transfer matrix method @xcite to obtain exact results at arbitrary temperatures for strips of widths going up to @xmath38 ( honeycomb lattice with free boundary conditions ) @xcite .",
    "such efforts have produced detailed studies for the square , triangular , and honeycomb lattices @xcite .    in many cases",
    "it is useful to exploit the recursive structure which is present in lattices of physical interest .",
    "even when the analytic solution is not available , using a simple ansatz which respects the recursive symmetry one can get an excellent agreement with the numerical data @xcite .",
    "motivated by these facts we develop a method that permits the calculation of the exact partition function for strips of virtually any kind of lattice .    the idea to use the dichromatic polynomial in the cases of recursive lattices has been proposed in @xcite , where the authors derive a scalar homogeneous recurrence equation of order higher than one , whose solution is the dichromatic polynomial of the corresponding graph . in the present paper it will be shown that it is possible to extend this idea by formulating vectorial homogeneous order one recurrence equations whose solutions represent the dichromatic polynomials of the graph corresponding to different boundary conditions . as it will be shown in the following sections",

    "in previous sections , it has been shown how to exploit directly the periodic recursive symmetry of lattices .",
    "the idea so far has been to derive a homogeneous first order linear recurrence relation for a vector which allows to solve recursive lattices which are more general than strip lattices .",
    "the reason is that our vectorial recursive system of equations only need periodic recursive symmetry in order to be applied .",
    "therefore , one can also analyze ornamented strip lattices which are , as it has been already explained , strip lattices whose geometry and width can change periodically . to achieve this goal",
    ", it is very important to analyze _ all the components _ of our vectorial recursive system of equations , and not just the component which represents the sought partition function .",
    "it is the interplay between the different components of the vector which provides one with the possibility to build up the exact solutions of ornamented strip lattices . in this sense ,",

    ", we have only analyzed cases in which the lattice has a periodic recursive symmetry , namely the recursive steps to construct the lattice are  always the same \" as in the cases of strip lattices as well as ornamented strip lattices .",
    "indeed , these are the most analyzed cases in the literature .",
    "on the other hand , the key idea of the present method also works for recursive non - periodic lattices .",
    "we will now show how to apply the present formalism to these cases as well .",
    "an interesting example is the lattice depicted in the fig .",
    "[ n - dep ] .",
    "the resulting linear system will indeed have an @xmath51-dependent transfer matrix , @xmath142 with , @xmath143 where @xmath144 stands for the partition function of the ring with @xmath51 vertices given by @xmath145 the @xmath51-dependence in ( [ matrixn ] ) is a manifestation of the fact that each new layer in the lattice is not the same as the previous one .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to apply the method in exactly the same way as before .",
    "the vector of the partition function can be written in the form @xmath146 where the boundary term is given by the two component vector @xmath147 .",
    "the partition function can be read from the first component of ( [ sol_n - dep ] ) . moreover",
    ", it turns to be quite complicated to resolve in general the characteristic equation corresponding to the recursive equation of the present example because the coefficients depends on @xmath51 .",
    "we have exploited a method based on the deletion - contraction theorem to obtain a variety of new exact results for the partition function of the potts model .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this technique is quite effective even in many cases in which the lattice topology is complicated .",
    "indeed , in order for such a method to be applied , the only requirement is that the lattice has a recursive symmetry while there is no need to assume extra symmetries .    in the case of lattice strips",
    ", we have shown that the technique is _ not _ restricted to be applied to the simpler cases of @xmath2 or @xmath148 . with the aid of a computer program",
    "we where able to find the exact transfer matrix for the @xmath3 kagom strip . in future work",
    "we intend to use the same approach to obtain exact results for the @xmath3 diced lattice strip .",
    "it has also been shown that this procedure can be easily applied to recursive lattices similar to strips but whose width changes periodically ( for instance , from @xmath149 to @xmath150 , where @xmath6 is an arbitrary integer number ) .",
    "the possibility to analyze lattices with less regular shapes than strips is a great advantage of the present method and could be quite important for applications .",
    "it is worth noting that this technique can be extended to deal with other boundary conditions such as periodic , toroidal or mbius .",
    "wider strips , which may capture two dimensional features more faithfully , can be considered as well .",
    "furthermore , since the calculation procedure is purely combinatoric , it works equally well for non - planar graphs .",
    "this approach offers also new perspectives for the analysis of scaling and the large @xmath0 limit .",
