    "the conceptual design of the tesla linear collider with integrated x - ray laser facility @xcite requires that one of the two 15 km long super - conducting linear accelerator has to provide beams for high energy physics ( hep ) experiments and beams for the x - ray free electron laser ( fel ) facility .",

    "[ overview ] shows the e@xmath1 linear accelerator which is used to accelerate the hep - beam to 250 gev and the fel - beam to energies up - to 50 gev .",
    "there are 25 gev and 50 gev extraction points in the linac .",
    "the hep beam is injected from the dog - bone damping ring into the main linear accelerator while the fel beam is generated with an rf - gun and accelerated to 5 gev in an injector linac before it is also injected into the main linear accelerator .",
    "the first part of the e@xmath1 linear accelerator is operated at a duty cycle of 10 hz providing hep ( 2882 bunches ) and fel ( 11315 bunches ) pulses in a alternating way .",
    "the pulse structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pulse ] .",
    "the fel - pulses are accelerated at the same gradient of 17 mv / m but are ejected at 25 gev or 50 gev beam energy to be used for different undulators .",
    "the basic optical building block is a fodo cell with a length of 65  m for the first half of the linac ( up - to 125 gev ) and a length of 97  m for the second half .",
    "two cryo - modules , housing 12 ( 7-cell ) cavities each , will fit between two quadrupoles of the 65  m long fodo cell , while three cryo - modules will fit between the quadrupoles of the 97  m long cell .",

    "a betatron phase advance of 60@xmath0 is chosen for the hep beam optics .",
    "this corresponds to a phase advance of about 90@xmath0 for the fel beam since the focusing is stronger than that of the hep beam due to the lower momentum .    for the availability of the beams it is important that a power supply failure or even a magnet failure does not cause a significant down time of the linac . in the next section",
    "it will be shown how the lattice can be matched with a quadrupole `` missing '' in the case of the 60@xmath0-fodo lattice .",
    "finally it is demonstrated that it is possible to match the lattice _",

    "the quadrupole strength is @xmath7 for a quadrupole length of @xmath8  m. the focusing effect of the cavities can be neglected for a high energy beam .",

    "now it is assumed that one power supply failed causing a significant betatron - mismatch ( see fig .",
    "[ fodomis ] ) . using the computer code comfort @xcite it is possible to rematch the beta - function such that two fodo cells down - stream from the missing quadrupole the original periodic solution is recovered . actually there exist several solutions which rematch the lattice .",
    "the solution presented in fig .",
    "[ fodomat ] fulfills the additional constraints that the strength of all quadrupoles does not exceed the design values of the standard 60@xmath0 lattice and that the polarity is unchanged , i.e. an f(d)-quad remains an f(d)-quad .",
    "the relative quadrupole strengths of the six matching quadrupoles ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are summarized in table [ results ] .               while the solution presented in fig .",
    "[ fodomat ] is perfect for the hep beam , the fel beam is still mismatched .",
    "it is of course possible to find another solution for the fel beam but that solution would not fulfill the matching conditions for the hep beam . in the next section",
    "a solution is shown which matched the lattice for the hep and fel beam simultaneously .",
    "simultaneous matching of the lattice for the hep and fel beams requires a solution to the following four equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 lattice transfer matrix depending on the quadrupole strengths @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are the horizontal and vertical twiss parameter of the hep and fel beam corresponding to the periodic solutions of a standard cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fodo60 ] and fig .",
    "[ fodo90 ] ) , and @xmath28 is the ratio of the beam momenta of the hep and fel beam .    commonly used beam optics computer codes like comfort can not match the beta - functions for two beams of different momenta simultaneously . using the code mathcad",
    "@xcite it is possible to solve the above equations numerically using @xmath29 quadrupoles .",
    "the algorithm is based on a quasi - newton method @xcite .",
    "the result of the computations is shown in fig .",
    "[ hepmatch ] for the hep beam and in fig .",
    "[ felmatch ] for the fel beam .",
    "please note that the magnetic gradient of all quads is the same in both cases only the beam momenta differ .",
    "the relative strengths of the 14 matching quadrupoles are given in table [ hepfelresults ] .",
    "one quadrupole is 22  % stronger than a quadrupole of a regular fodo cell , which is not critical since the simultaneous matching solution is only required for beam energies up - to 50  gev .",
    "it has been demonstrated that there exist matched beam optics with a missing quadrupole for the hep beam and even simultaneously for the hep and fel beam .",
    "therefore a power supply failure will not cause a significant down - time of the linear accelerator since the operation can continue with a re - matched lattice .",
