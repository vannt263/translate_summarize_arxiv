    "the study on the collective behaviour of birds , animals , fishes , etc .",
    "has not only drawn the attention of biologists , but also of computer scientists and roboticists .",
    "thus several methods of cooperative control @xcite of multi - agent system have evolved , where a single robot is not sufficient to accomplish the given task , like navigation and foraging of unknown territory .",
    "these methods can broadly be categorized as the behaviour based approach ( @xcite-@xcite ) , leader follower based approach @xcite-@xcite , virtual structure based approach @xcite-@xcite , artificial potential based navigation @xcite-@xcite , graph theoretic method @xcite-@xcite , formation shape control @xcite-@xcite . among other works carried out on single group of robots , cluster space control @xcite ,",
    "distance based formation @xcite , formation control of nonholonomic robots @xcite , kinematic control @xcite , and mobile robots subject to wheel slip @xcite , segregation of heterogeneous robots @xcite , are to name a few .",
    "+ the problem associated with the formation control of multi - agent system is that it becomes difficult to accurately position the robot within the group , as the number of robots increases . to address this issue shape control and region based shape control",
    "have been proposed , such that the robots form a desired shape during movement .",
    "the desired shape can be union or intersection of different geometric shapes .",
    "region based shape control have been extended to multiple groups of robots @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the robots can stay anywhere inside the specified region without colliding with each other .",
    "this means that the position of a robot inside a group can be specified and can further be controlled .",
    "therefore the position of a group of robots inside a larger group of robots can also be specified and controlled . moreover , when it comes to the control of multiple groups of robots , there should be at least one robot to convey the information of that group to another group .",
    "+ in an attempt to solve the positioning accuracy , we propose a hierarchical topology , here in this paper , which is based on the centroid based transformations @xcite-@xcite for single group of robots . in this architecture , the large group of robots",
    "have been partitioned into relatively small basic units containing three or four robots .",
    "then the centroid of each unit have been connected to form larger module containing more robots .",
    "extending the process will give a hierarchical architecture which is a composition of relatively smaller modules .",
    "as the construction of this topology involves connecting the centroid , it has been named centroid based topology ( cbt ) .",
    "the cbts basically capture the constraint relationship among the robots . using cbt",
    "it is possible to separates shape variables from the centroid and this technique separates the formation shape controller and tracking controller design . as the centroid moves",
    ", the entire structure moves maintaining the shape specified by the shape variables .",
    "in this paper , we study the formation of multiple groups of robots in a modular architecture . using the concept of cbt",
    ", we define * intra group shape variables * , * inter group shape variables * along with centroid .",
    "based on this modular structure , sliding mode based controllers have been designed for each module .",
    "the gains of the controllers have been chosen such that the subsystems reach the sliding surface at different time featuring the stretched time scale properties of singularly perturbed system .",
    "singular perturbation based sliding mode controller design gives us the freedom to run the superfast [ intra group formation ] to slowest dynamics [ tracking of centroid ] simultaneously without waiting for the convergence of others .",
    "furthermore , potential function based sliding surfaces have been selected to design controllers to avoid inter robot collision in finite time .",
