    ", it is often the case that ultraviolet divergence encountered in the potential can be avoided by calculating directly the force , namely , by differentiating with respect to the coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "this is since the diverging part does not depend on the coordinate @xmath17 .",

    "in contrast , for the zero - point forces inside capacitors considered here , the same ultraviolet divergence of the potential also appears in the force .",

    ", the function @xmath134 does not affect the ultraviolet convergence properties of the integral in ( [ s_dudc ] ) .",
    "therefore , its convergence properties , and hence those of the force , exactly follow those of the potential .",
    "consider a mechanical oscillator such as the drumhead mode of the capacitor plate from ref .",
    "the zero - point electronic force @xmath143 acting on the plate depends on a parameter of the circuit , generally denoted by @xmath53 . for a given circuit with a constant @xmath53 ,",
    "the resulting static force will shift the plate by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the mechanical resonant frequency of the plate and @xmath73 its mass .",
    "therefore , in principle , one can infer the function @xmath143 by measuring the plate position @xmath146 as a function of @xmath53 , provided that the `` signal '' value @xmath147 is larger than the standard deviation of the noise on @xmath146 .",
    "this is the essence of the static method . in the dynamic method @xcite",
    ", we further consider a weak modulation of the circuit parameter around its value @xmath53 in which we wish to measure , @xmath148 , with @xmath149 is the modulation frequency . since the modulation is weak ,",
    "@xmath150 , we can expand the force as @xmath151\\approx f(z)+\\delta z(t)\\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}\\right|_z$ ] and the equation of motion for the plate position becomes , @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the mechanical damping of the plate . solving this in frequency space we obtain the spectrum of the displacement signal ( for @xmath154 and in units of m@xmath59hz@xmath60 ) ,",

    "the displacement signal @xmath157 ( in units of meters ) is then obtained by integrating this spectrum with @xmath158 over the bandwidth of the modulation and taking the square root . for a modulation bandwidth @xmath159 around the mechanical resonance @xmath145 ,",
    "this yields @xmath160 namely , the signal at @xmath53 is proportional to the derivative of force with respect to @xmath53 , evaluated at @xmath53 . in terms of the signal of the static method from eq.([s_x ] ) , we find @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the quality factor of the mechanical resonance and @xmath163 is a small parameter determined by the adjustable modulation strength @xmath164 . in order to be able to measure the force",
    ", this signal has to be much larger than the noise in @xmath146 contained in the bandwidth @xmath165 .",
    "hence the dynamic method may be advantageous for small modulation bandwidth and high @xmath166 of the mechanical resonator .    in order to estimate the possibility to measure the fn scale forces we find in fig .",
    "3 , we consider the physical parameters of the electromechanical capacitor from ref .",
    "beginning with the static method , the signal from eq .",
    "( [ s_x ] ) , for a force @xmath167 fn and mechanical parameters @xmath168 pg and @xmath169mhz @xcite , is @xmath170 m , which is much smaller than the mechanical zero - point motion of the plate , @xmath171 m , making the static method irrelevant . turning to the dynamical method , the displacement sensitivity ( noise spectrum ) of the device in ref .",
    "@xcite , which depends on the magnitude of a probe signal used in the measurement , reaches an optimum of @xmath172m@xmath59hz@xmath60 .",
    "considering non - optimal operation , we take @xmath173m@xmath59hz@xmath60 over the bandwidth of interest . the noise signal , @xmath174 , for @xmath175 @xcite and a bandwidth of e.g. @xmath176 , is @xmath177 m . comparing it to the signal , eq .",
    "( [ s_xs ] ) , with a modulation strength of e.g. @xmath178 , we find @xmath179 m , three orders of magnitude larger than the noise .",
    "such a signal - to - noise ratio is likely to be sufficient in order to resolve forces such as those from fig .",
    "an important aspect of the possibility to measure the electronic zero - point forces as a function of circuit parameters is the ability to distinguish them from other forces that act between the capacitor plates .",
    "such an ability naturally relies on the assumption that these other forces do not change with the circuit parameters @xmath53 , therefore yielding only a constant shift to the force as a function of @xmath53 . in the following we examine this assumption for dipolar - like forces , using the example of the casimir force induced by the electromagnetic vacuum in a circuit environment .",
    "a pair of parallel plates ( the capacitor ) in free space will exhibit an attractive force due to their interaction with the vacuum fluctuations of the plane - wave electromagnetic modes of free space , the well - known casimir force ( fig .",
    "s1a ) . consider now that the two capacitor plates are embedded in an infinite transmission line ( tl ) , namely , they are connected to infinitely - long circuit wires ( fig .",
    "the electromagnetic modes supported by the tl are different than those of free space , and correspondingly may lead to a slightly modified vacuum - induced casimir force , denoted @xmath180 .",
    "the case that we are concerned with however is that of fig .",
    "1sc , where the capacitor is embedded in a tl of length @xmath181 , terminated by a general impedance @xmath53 .",
    "the force between the plates in this case can be written as @xmath182 here @xmath180 is the component of the force just due the fact that the capacitor is embedded inside a tl ( as in fig .",
    "s1b ) , whereas @xmath183 is the component due to the _ interaction _ between the capacitor and the scatterer @xmath53 , mediated by the electromagnetic modes of the tl structure .",
    "the latter component is in turn divided into its contribution mediated by the tem mode and that mediated by all other transverse modes supported by the structure .",
    "the tem mode is the fundamental transverse mode of a tl .",
    "it has a frequency - independent transverse profile , characterized by a constant line impedance ( equivalently , by an effective area ) , and a linear dispersion relation , so that it forms the 1d propagating plane waves that are taken into account by circuit theory ( possibly , including the lumped - circuit assumption , @xmath184 , for all relevant @xmath14 s , see below ) .",
    "the rest of the modes ( `` other '' ) consist of an infinite series of guided modes which possess a cutoff frequency larger than @xmath185 ( @xmath63 being the conductors that form the tl , see fig .",
    "s1d ) , and whose transverse profile and dispersion depend on the structure of the tl , such as the te and tm modes of a coaxial line [ fig .",
    "s1d(i ) ] @xcite . for an open planar transmission line , such as the coplanar waveguide [ fig .",
    "s1d(ii ) ] or a microstrip , there are additional non - guided modes .",
    "let us now examine the role of each of the contributions to the force .",
    "the force that we calculated using our circuit theory is @xmath186 .",
    "the length @xmath181 does not appear in our calculation since it can be absorbed in the impedance @xmath53 by using the reflection properties of impedances in tl theory @xcite , or by simply assuming that the circuit is lumped , @xmath187 for any relevant @xmath14 ( namely , @xmath14 values below the effective cutoff of the converging integrals we calculate ) .",
    "the contribution due to the introduction of the vacuum of the tl modes , @xmath188 , does not depend on @xmath53 , and hence only gives a constant shift to the measurement as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "the _ main question _ is then , whether the component @xmath189 , which is _ not _ taken into account by our circuit theory and which _ does _ depend on @xmath53 , gives a contribution large enough to mask the `` signal '' @xmath186 .    in order to answer this question ,",
    "consider first the contribution to @xmath189 which is mediated by the guided modes with a cutoff frequency . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the vdw potential mediated by these modes between two scatterers ( the capacitor and @xmath53 in our case ) is suppressed exponentially with the distance @xmath181 scaled to the width @xmath63 , so that for @xmath190 , they are negligible with respect to the tem circuit - theory contribution . for tls used in circuit qed experiments , @xmath191 m , which is much smaller than the relevant wavelengths @xmath192 , so that it should be natural to work in the regime @xmath193 , where @xmath189 , mediated by guided modes , is negligible and can be ignored . in a coaxial tl ,",
    "these are the only `` other '' modes that exist apart from the tl , so that our theory can be readily applied there . for an open tl , such as the coplanar waveguide ( fig .",
    "s2b ) , we should also consider the contribution to @xmath189 from non - guided modes .",
    "these modes resemble free - space modes and therefore are expected to give an interaction @xmath189 that decays as a power - law with distance , e.g. @xmath194 for weak scatterers",
    "( force resulting from vdw interaction ) .",
    "again , by choosing sufficiently long @xmath181 , these forces can become negligible with respect to those mediated by the tem modes ( captured by our circuit theory ) , which e.g. in the vdw case decay much slower , as @xmath195 @xcite .    to conclude , we have considered the electromagnetic zero - point forces between polarized objects , which are not accounted for in our circuit theory .",
    "we have generally shown that by properly choosing the distance @xmath181 , the dependence of these forces on @xmath53 [ namely , the component @xmath189 ] can be effectively eliminated .",
    "the specific required length of @xmath181 depends on the tl system we consider , and can range from a few microns ( @xmath190 ) in a closed tl to e.g. a few microwave wavelengths ( @xmath197 ) in the planar open tl case ( recall that in such a case the lumped circuit description is valid when @xmath53 absorbs the length @xmath181 using impedance reflection properties of tl theory ) .",
    "consider the circuit from fig .",
    "1d in the main text .",
    "it can be divided into two systems ; namely , the circuit @xmath53 and the superconducting qubit ( scq ) . out of the many degrees of freedom that these systems may possess , and following the hamiltonian description of circuits @xcite , we focus on the two degrees of freedom that appear in fig .",
    "1d , that is , the circuit nodes @xmath63 and @xmath198 , belonging to the systems @xmath53 and @xmath198 , respectively ( @xmath198 denoting the scq ) .",
    "each circuit node is represented by a dynamical variable ( operator ) , e.g. voltage @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) , or more commonly the `` flux '' defined by @xmath201 .",
    "then , the interaction between the systems @xmath53 and @xmath198 , coupled by the capacitor @xmath202 , is given by @xcite @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the canonical conjugate of @xmath205 and @xmath62 is the total capacitance of the scq ( for a transmon qubit this capacitance includes that related to the josephson junctions and an additional large capacitance @xcite ) . for weak coupling @xmath61 , we can take the rest of the hamiltonian as that of the two noninteracting systems .",
    "for the scq this hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath206 with @xmath207 the electron charge and @xmath77 the josephson energy , and where @xmath208 are the eigenstates of @xmath209 with eigenenergies @xmath210 .",
    "the system @xmath53 is assumed to be a linear circuit which may include resistive elements ( dissipation ) . in the hamiltonian formalism , such a dissipative system can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath211 of a continuous spectrum of harmonic oscillators . however , in order to describe the effect of this dissipative system on the scq , we would not need to use such a detailed model .",
    "instead , we will treat the dissipative system as a _",
    "reservoir _ to which the scq system is damped . this will allow us to use the tools of quantum open systems which do not depend on the structure of @xmath211 , rather only on the noninteracting statistics of @xmath212 .      moving to an interaction picture with respect to the noninteracting part of the hamiltonian , @xmath213 ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes , @xmath214 with the tilded operators in the interaction picture , and with @xmath215 .",
    "assuming the weak - coupling regime between the system and the reservoir , we can derive a quantum master equation for the scq system damped by the reservoir @xmath53 .",
    "this can be done as usual by assuming a stationary state for the reservoir and using the fourier expansion @xmath216 , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 take the role of the harmonic oscillator lowering and rising operators of the reservoir , in more standard derivations @xcite .",
    "the result is a markovian master equation from which we can deduce the effective non - hermitian correction to the scq hamiltonian , induced by the reservoir , @xmath219 .",

    "<S> recalling that the lumped - element description used in circuit theory is based on a quasistatic approximation valid for @xmath25 , @xmath26 being a typical element size , this divergence implies that such long - wavelength description can not account well for the @xmath27-circuit situation . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the divergence encountered by trying to calculate the lamb shift using the dipole approximation @xcite , where here the atom and the electromagnetic vacuum are replaced by the capacitor and the resistor , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> we note that in order for the renormalized finite result to comply with circuit theory , the integration over @xmath14 has to begin converging at frequencies below the cutoff of the theory , @xmath90 @xcite . in case ( i ) this leads to the validity condition @xmath91 , whereas similar conditions are found for all other cases @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this renromalization procedure can be generalized as follows . for a given circuit </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a `` reference circuit '' by taking the @xmath92 limit for the impedances of its components , i.e. short circuit for capacitors and open circuit for inductors . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized energy of the circuit is given by subtracting that of the `` reference circuit '' from that of the `` bare '' circuit . </S>",
