    "a major simplification of the pairing problem is achieved if one assumes a charge independent nuclear interaction ( the proton - proton @xmath3 interaction and the neutron - neutron @xmath4 interaction are equal to the isospin @xmath5 proton - neutron @xmath6 interaction ) .",
    "the latter comprises a quite reasonable approximation and consequently most of isovector ( isospin 1 ) pairing studies have been carried under the assumption of isospin invariance .",
    "however , ",
    "the problem of broken symmetry is one of general significance in nuclear ( e.g. @xcite ) and elementary particle ( e.g. @xcite ) physics \" @xcite ( vol .",
    "i , p.37 ) , which has been of long - standing interest @xcite and may be associated with novel and interesting physics @xcite .",
    "experimental results clearly reveal the existence of isospin mixing @xcite .",
    "an increase in isospin mixing towards medium mass nuclei has been detected in novel high - precision experiments @xcite , which continue to push the exploration of unstable nuclei with the advent of advanced radioactive beam facilities .    the isospin symmetry in nuclei is slightly violated by the electromagnetic interaction , mainly the coulomb repulsion between nucleons @xcite .",
    "another source of mixing probability is the isospin non - conserving part of the nuclear hamiltonian , which includes effects due to the proton - neutron mass difference ( @xmath7 ) and small charge dependent components in the strong nucleonic interaction that appear to be associated with the electromagnetic structure of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath8 scattering in the @xmath6 system and the low - energy @xmath3 scattering lead to the estimate that the pure nuclear interaction between protons and neutrons ( @xmath9 ) in @xmath5 states are more attractive than the force between the protons ( @xmath10 ) by @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , after the coulomb energy is taken into account the discrepancy in the isobaric - multiplet energies is bigger for the seniority zero levels as compared to higher - seniority states indicating the presence of a short range charge dependent interaction @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath13 pairing correlations have been recently shown to have an overwhelming dominance in the isotensor energy difference within isobaric multiplets @xcite , which manifests itself in the charge dependent @xmath14 nature of the pairing interaction .    the aforementioned findings set the need for a charge dependent microscopic description of @xmath13 pairing correlations . for this reason we employ a simple but powerful group - theoretical model @xcite , which is based on the @xmath0 algebra ( isomorphic to @xmath15 @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison with experimental data demonstrates that the @xmath16 model provides a reasonable description of the pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath1 states ) odd - odd nuclei , as well as , for example , low - lying @xmath1 states in odd - odd nuclei that have the same isospin as the ground state of a semi - magic even - even isobaric neighbor with fully - paired protons ( or neutrons ) . ] in light and medium mass nuclei , where protons and neutrons occupy the same shell @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 model is precisely suitable for the microscopic modeling of the pairing interaction and its isospin violation in isobaric analog @xmath1 states   because it naturally extends the isospin invariant nuclear interaction to incorporate isospin non - conserving forces , while it retains the @xmath16 dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "hence it provides a straightforward scheme for estimating the significance of the isospin mixing due to pairing correlations without the need for carrying out large - dimensional matrix diagonalizations .",
    "strong isospin breaking in pair formation , if found , implies a significant presence of isospin admixture among the seniority - zero isobaric analog @xmath1 states  including @xmath1 ground states .",
    "this in turn will affect the predictive power of precise studies of superallowed @xmath17 fermi @xmath18-decay transitions .",
    "laboratory and theoretical investigations of such transitions provide reliable tests of isospin mixing ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in addition , the results of examinations on isospin mixing are essential to another challenging problem ; namely , when compared to the decay rate for purely leptonic muon decay , the estimate for the nuclear fermi @xmath2 decay rate furnishes a precise test of the unitary condition of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite under the assumption of the three - generation standard particle model ( for a review of this subject , see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath16 model reflects the symplectic dynamical symmetry of isobaric analog @xmath1 states   @xcite determined by the strong nuclear interaction .",
    "the weaker coulomb interaction breaks this symmetry and significantly complicates the nuclear pairing problem .",
    "this is why , in our investigation we adopt a sophisticated phenomenological coulomb correction to the experimental energies such that a nuclear system can be regarded as if there is no coulomb interaction between its constituents .",
    "coulomb corrected _ experimental energy , @xmath19 , for given valence protons @xmath20 and neutrons @xmath21 is adjusted to be @xmath22 where ) the energies are assumed positive for bound states ; @xmath23 is also defined positive .",
    "] @xmath24 is the total measured energy including the coulomb energy @xcite , @xmath25 is the binding energy of the core , and @xmath26 is the coulomb correction for a nucleus with mass @xmath27 and @xmath28 protons taken relative to the core @xmath29 .",
    "the recursion formula for the @xmath30 coulomb energy is derived in @xcite with the use of the pape and antony formula @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 for @xmath27 even or @xmath33 for @xmath27 odd .",
    "when @xmath34 the coulomb potential is given by @xmath35 the coulomb corrected energies ( [ eexpcoul ] ) should reflect solely the nuclear properties of the many - nucleon systems .",
    "assuming charge independence of the nuclear force , the general isoscalar hamiltonian with sp(4 ) dynamical symmetry , which consists of one- and two - body terms and conserves the number of particles , can be expressed through the sp(4 ) group generators , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the shell dimension for a given nucleon type .",
    "the generators @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the valence isospin operators , @xmath41 create ( annihilate ) respectively a proton - neutron ( @xmath6 ) pair , a proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) pair or a neutron - neutron @xmath42 pair of total angular momentum @xmath43 and isospin @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the total number of valence particles with an eigenvalue @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 are interaction strength parameters and @xmath49 is the fermi level energy ( see table i in @xcite for estimates ) .",
    "the isospin conserving hamiltonian ( [ clh0 ] ) includes an isovector ( @xmath44 ) pairing interaction ( @xmath50 for attraction ) and a diagonal isoscalar ( @xmath51 ) force , which is related to a symmetry term ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the two - body model interaction includes proton - neutron and like - particle pairing plus symmetry terms and contains a non - negligible implicit portion of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath16 model interaction itself , which relates to the whole energy spectrum rather than to a single @xmath53 @xmath44 state , was found to be quite strongly correlated ( @xmath54 ) with the realistic cd - bonn+3terms interaction @xcite in the @xmath44 channel and with an overall correlation of @xmath55 with the realistic gxpf1 interaction @xcite for the @xmath56 orbit @xcite . in short , the relatively simple @xmath16 model seems to be a reasonable approximation that reproduces especially that part of the interaction that is responsible for shaping pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath1 states .",
    "charge dependent but charge symmetric and @xmath4 interactions is found to be small ; namely , less than @xmath57 @xcite . ] nucleon - nucleon interaction ( @xmath58 ) brings into the nuclear hamiltonian a small isotensor component ( with zero third isospin projection so that the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is achieved in the framework of the @xmath16 model by introducing the two additional terms , @xmath60 to the isospin invariant model hamiltonian ( [ clh0 ] ) in a way that the hamiltonian @xmath61 possesses @xmath16 dynamical symmetry .",
    "the interaction strength parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( [ hinc ] ) determined in an optimum fit over a significant number of nuclei ( total of 149 ) @xcite yield non - zero values ( see table i in @xcite for estimates ) .",
    "as expected from observations , for the @xmath64 level the interaction strengths of all @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairing are found to be almost equal ( @xmath65 is a good quantum number ) , @xmath66 , and they differ for the @xmath56 and for the @xmath67 shells , with the @xmath6 isovector strength being more attractive , @xmath68 .",
    "the full hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) yields quantitative results that are superior than the ones with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; for example , in the case of the @xmath56 level the variance between the model and experimental energies of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 states   increases by @xmath71 when the @xmath63 and @xmath62 interactions are turned off . for the present investigation the parameters in ( [ clh0 ] ) along with @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( [ hinc ] )",
    "are not varied as their values were fixed to be physically valid and to yield reasonable energy @xcite and fine structure @xcite reproduction for light and medium mass nuclei with valence protons and neutrons occupying the same shell .",
    "for these nuclei in the mass range @xmath72 , the pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath1 states  are well described , but still approximately , by the eigenvectors of the effective hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) in a basis of fully - paired ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 @xmath44 pairs ) @xmath1 states ( table [ tab : classifca ] ) .",
    "while the second interaction ( @xmath73 ) in ( [ hinc ] ) takes into account only the splitting of the isobaric analog energies , the first correction induces small isospin mixing ( i m ) .",
    "the isospin mixing interaction ( [ hinc ] ) does not account for the entire interaction that mixes states of same angular momentum and parity but different isospin values .",
    "it only describes a possible @xmath74 mixing between isobaric analog @xmath1 states  due to a pure nuclear pairing interaction .",
    "while the extent of such isospin admixing is expected to be smaller than the total mixing due to isospin non - conserving terms @xcite , it may influence precise model calculations depending on the importance of the charge dependence in pairing correlations .",
    "the question regarding how strong individual isospin non - conserving nuclear interactions are [ such as ( [ hinc ] ) ] still remains open  there are no sharp answers at the present level of experimental results and microscopic theoretical interpretations .",
    "it is only their overall contribution that is revealed by the free nucleon - nucleon data @xcite to be slightly ( by @xmath11 ) more attractive in the @xmath6 @xmath5 system than the @xmath3 one . within the framework of the @xmath16 model",
    ", the charge dependence of the pure nuclear interaction can be estimated through the comparison of the @xmath75 two - body model interaction [ ( [ clh ] ) with @xmath76 relative to the @xmath77 in the @xmath78 multiplets , which , for example in the @xmath56 level , is on average @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath16 model reproduces reasonably well the @xmath80-coefficient in the well - known isobaric multiplet mass equation @xcite @xmath81 for the binding energies of isobaric analogs ( of the same mass number @xmath27 , isospin @xmath65 , angular momentum @xmath82 , etc . ) , where the coefficient @xmath80 ( @xmath83 ) depends on the isotensor ( isovector ) component of the nuclear interaction [ i.e. , of rank 2 ( 1 ) with respect to isospin ` rotations ' ] .",
    "the requirement that the coefficients of ( [ imme ] ) are well reproduced is essential for the isospin non - conserving models @xcite , which has been achieved in @xcite by increasing ( approximately by @xmath84 ) of all the @xmath44 @xmath6 matrix elements relative to the @xmath4 ones and which has lead to a conclusion in @xcite that the isotensor nature of the nuclear interaction is dominated by a @xmath13 pairing term . in agreement with experiment ,",
    "the @xmath80-coefficients in the @xmath16 model were found to be negative and very close to zero for @xmath44 multiplets in the @xmath56 shell .",
    "their average relative to the binding energy of the valence nucleons differs from the corresponding experimental value by only 0.3% .",
    "these estimations do not aim to confirm the charge - dependence , which is very difficult at this level of accuracy compared to the broad energy range considered in the model for nuclei with masses @xmath85 .",
    "nonetheless , it reflects the fingerprints of the experimental data in the properties of the model interaction ( [ clh ] ) .      for a superallowed fermi @xmath86-decay transition ( @xmath87 )",
    "the @xmath88 comparative lifetime is nucleus - independent according to the conserved - vector - current ( cvc ) hypothesis and given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 gev@xmath91s ( @xmath92 is the mass of the electron ) and @xmath93 is the vector coupling constant for nuclear @xmath2 decay ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "for more than two - state mixing , the degree of isospin admixture between isobaric analog @xmath1 states   should be estimated using the normalized transition matrix element between non - analog ( na ) states ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath107 where @xmath104 is the almost good isospin of the parent nucleus ( figure [ cabetadecays ] for the @xmath56 level ) .",

    "[ tab : betaca ]    in general , the @xmath111 correction may be very different than the order of the @xmath112 overlap quantity @xmath113 \\label{delta}\\ ] ] of the @xmath114 nuclear states with the isospin eigenvectors ( figure [ mixingovlpf7 ] ) .",
    "this is because in decays the degrees of isospin mixing between non - analog states within both the parent and daughter nuclei are significant . as it is expected , the @xmath115 isospin mixing increases as @xmath28 and @xmath116 approach one another and towards the middle of the shell .",
    "although the isospin admixture is negligible for light nuclei in the @xmath117 orbit ( @xmath118 for @xmath119ar , @xmath120 ) , it is clearly bigger for the @xmath121 level ( figure [ mixingovlpf7 ] ) , yet less than @xmath122 .",
    "= 3.0 in    the analysis of the results for the @xmath56 orbit shows that the mixing between isobaric analog @xmath1 states   ( which is at least @xmath110 mixing ) is on average @xmath123 excluding even - even @xmath124 nuclei ( figure [ cabetadecays ] ) .",
    "this is on the order of a magnitude less than the mixing of the first excited @xmath1 non - analog state due to isospin non - conserving interaction , which is typically about @xmath125 for the @xmath56 level @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is smaller than possible gamow - teller transitions , @xmath126 for the nuclei in the @xmath56 shell @xcite , that are found substantially larger with increasing mass number @xmath27 @xcite",
    ". this makes @xmath111 mixing very difficult to be detected especially when the isospin - symmetry breaking correction ( @xmath127 ) to analog fermi matrix elements in this level is on the order of a percent @xcite .    despite the lack of experimental data , a rough estimate for the order of the @xmath128 mixing induced by @xmath129 ( [ hinc ] ) in the @xmath16 model",
    "can be obtained in comparison to other types of mixing corrections that are measured or calculated .",
    "for example , the @xmath2-decay transition from the ground state of @xmath130v to the first excited @xmath1 non - analog state in @xmath130ti at @xmath131 mev yields an experimental correction of @xmath132 @xcite , which is also reproduced by theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the first excited @xmath1 @xmath133 state in @xmath130ti that is an isobaric analog to the ground state of @xmath130ca lies at @xmath134 mev ( as predicted by the @xmath16 model @xcite ) and its mixing into the @xmath135 ground state should yield an isospin symmetry - breaking correction on the order of : @xmath136 which is about the values the @xmath16 model yields for @xmath74 non - analog transition between @xmath130v and @xmath130ti ( figure [ cabetadecays ] ) . clearly",
    ", such a comparison is approximate with respect to the high accuracy of the isospin mixing effects .",
    "yet the results show consistency with other theoretical calculations and are found not to contradict reasonable limits set up by experimental evidences .",
    "not surprising , the largest values for the @xmath128 correction are observed for @xmath74 @xmath137-decays to energetically accessible @xmath1 ground states of even - even @xmath124 nuclei ( figure [ cabetadecays ] ) . while for these decays",
    "@xmath138 is extremely small , namely less than @xmath139 , as expected for the contribution of the higher - lying @xmath1 states @xcite , it is comparable to the order of isospin - symmetry breaking corrections for the @xmath56 orbit that are typically taken into account @xcite .",
    "the reason is that for the even - even @xmath124 nuclei the second - lying isobaric analog @xmath1 states   are situated relatively low due to a significant @xmath6 interaction ( figure [ cabetadecays ] ) . as an example",
    ", one finds that for the decay to the @xmath140cr ground state @xmath111 may be only about 5 times smaller [ proportional to the ratio in the energies squared as in ( [ estimias ] ) ] than an average @xmath141 isospin - symmetry breaking correction in the @xmath56 orbit and takes the latter to be around @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath16 model yields @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "above all , the @xmath128 results in figure [ cabetadecays ] clearly show the overall pattern and the order of significance of the isospin mixing under consideration .",
    "this is evident within the first - order approximation in terms of the @xmath62 parameter ( @xmath145 ) of @xmath128 ( table [ tab : betaca ] ) , which for @xmath56 deviates on average by only 2% from its exact calculations in figure [ cabetadecays ] .",
    "the @xmath146 isospin mixing correction is then proportional to @xmath147 and one finds out that its order of magnitude remains the same for large variations of the @xmath62 parameter of more than 60% .",
    "in addition , greater @xmath62 values are not very likely because the @xmath128 estimates ( figure [ cabetadecays ] ) fall close below an upper limit , which does not contradict experimental and theoretical results for other types of isospin mixing .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while the energies of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 states   determined directly the parameters of the model interaction , a quite good reproduction of the experimental higher - lying isobaric analog @xmath1 state  energies followed without any parameter adjustment @xcite .",
    "this outcome is important because the energy difference between two isobaric analog @xmath1 states   within a nucleus directly affects the degree of their mixing .",
    "moreover , in this first - order approximation the ratio of any two isospin corrections within a shell , where the strengths of the effective interaction are assumed fixed , is independent of the parameters of the model interaction .",
    "this implies that such a ratio does not reflect at all the uncertainties of the interaction strength parameters but rather it is characteristic of the relative strength of both decays .",
    "we choose to compare @xmath146 for different @xmath74 @xmath86-decays to the isospin mixing correction , denoted by @xmath148 , of the decay between nuclear isobars with @xmath149 valence particles [ such as the @xmath150 decay for the @xmath56 orbit ( table [ tab : betaca ] ) ] due to the relative simplicity of these nuclear systems .",
    "the @xmath151 ratio then identifies the decay , for which the maximum isospin mixing correction is expected in the @xmath56 orbit , namely @xmath152 , and as well as the amount by which @xmath128 of the other possible non - analog decays is relatively suppressed ( table [ tab : betaca ] ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath128 correction for the @xmath153 decay is around 1.5 times smaller than the maximum one and it is around 8 times smaller for the @xmath154 decay . such a ratio quantity exhibits a general trend of increasing @xmath128 isospin mixing with @xmath28 within same isospin multiplets and as well it reveals enhanced @xmath74 decays to the ground state of even - even @xmath124 nuclei with increasing @xmath128 towards the middle of the shell .",
    "furthermore , the ratio retains its behavior for the non - analog @xmath2 decays between nuclei with the same valence proton and neutron numbers as in table [ tab : betaca ] but occupying the @xmath67 major shell ( table [ tab : betani ] ) .",
    "therefore , among the non - analog @xmath2 decays for the @xmath155 isobars with valence protons and neutrons in the @xmath67 shell the @xmath128 isospin mixing of the @xmath156 decay is expected to be the largest with a tendency of a further increase towards the middle of the shell . while the decay mentioned above exhibits isospin mixing twice stronger than the one for the @xmath157 decay , the other @xmath155 @xmath2 decays are up to 110 times slower ( table [ tab : betani ] ) .",
    "in addition , one needs to calculate only the isospin mixing for the simplest case of four valence nucleons , for then the order of significance of @xmath128 for the other @xmath158 decays follow directly from the estimations presented in table [ tab : betani ] .    [",
    "tab : betani ]    even though the strength of the isospin mixing interaction may differ between different model spaces , the ratio , @xmath151 , turns out to be of the same order for both the @xmath56 level ( tables [ tab : betaca ] ) and the upper @xmath159 shell ( table [ tab : betani ] ) .",
    "in addition , the ratio strongly correlates for both shells retaining the same behavior as one goes from one model space to the other . in short ,",
    "the significance of the isospin mixing caused by a charge dependent @xmath13 pairing correlations is evident from table [ tab : betaca ] for the @xmath56 level and continues the same trend for the upper @xmath159 shell ( table [ tab : betani ] ) .",
    "indeed , the relative strength of the first - order isospin mixing correction for non - analog fermi @xmath18-decays under consideration varies smoothly with the size of the model space ( figure [ deltavsomega ] ) .",
    "all the @xmath74 decays relative to the one with four valence nucleons need an isospin mixing correction to the transition matrix elements that increases with the occupation space .",
    "such an increase however keeps all of the decays under consideration suppressed relatively to the @xmath149 decay ( with the largest @xmath160 still about four times smaller than @xmath161 ) .",
    "an exception is the @xmath74 decay to the ground state of the @xmath124 @xmath162 nucleus , which is significantly faster for any @xmath163 space size .",
    "this decay becomes @xmath164 times faster in the pair - boson limit of very large @xmath165 , which is an increase of @xmath166 compared to @xmath167 .",
    "while the @xmath168 nuclear systems exhibit an increase of only @xmath169 , the isospin mixing correction increases 1.8 times for all the @xmath162 decays to a daughter nucleus of almost good isospin @xmath170 . in short , the @xmath16 model allows one to easily estimate the relative strength of different decays within a shell and hence to identify the fastest decay as well as the ones that can be readily neglected in precise isospin mixing calculations .",
    "isospin mixing induced by a short - range charge dependent nuclear interaction is described microscopically within the framework of a group - theoretical approach based on the @xmath16 dynamical symmetry .",
    "the @xmath16 model interaction incorporates the main driving forces , including @xmath13 pairing correlations and implicit quadrupole - quadrupole term , that shape the nuclear pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath1 states  in the @xmath56 level where the @xmath16 hamiltonian correlates strongly with realistic interactions .    empirical evidence such as",
    "scattering analysis and the coefficient related to the isotensor part of a general non - conserving force , @xmath80 , reveals the charge dependence of the @xmath13 pairing correlations .",
    "indeed , the slightly stronger proton - neutron pairing interaction than the like - particle ( proton - proton or neutron - neutron ) pairing interaction came out of the @xmath16 analysis in a quite good reproduction of the energies of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 states   and the @xmath80-coefficient for a wide - range nuclear systems .",
    "the freedom allowed in the algebraic model by introducing additional non - conserving forces reflects the symmetries observed in light nuclei ( good isospin ) and the comparatively larger symmetry - breaking as expected in medium - mass nuclei .",
    "the isospin - symmetry breaking due to coupling of isobaric analog @xmath1 states   in nuclei was estimated to be extremely small for nuclei in the @xmath64 and @xmath56 orbitals . however , the @xmath124 even - even light and medium mass nuclei are an exception . for these nuclei ,",
    "strong pairing correlations , including a significant @xmath6 interaction , are responsible for the existence of comparatively larger isospin mixing , although the latter is still at least an order of a magnitude smaller than the overall isospin admixture in the ground state . the results also show that a variation of more than 60% in the @xmath62 isospin mixing parameter is required to reduce the present @xmath111 results by an order of a magnitude .",
    "the analysis also shows that there is a trend of increasing isospin mixing between isobaric analog @xmath1 states  due to a charge dependent @xmath13 pairing interaction towards the middle of the shell and for @xmath74 decays to the ground state of an even - even @xmath124 daughter nucleus .",
    "such behavior is free of the uncertainties in the strength parameters of the interaction and is adequate for larger multi-@xmath171 shell domains such as @xmath172 . for nuclei with valence protons and neutrons occupying the @xmath56 level the strongest non - analog decay is identified to be @xmath173 with the @xmath111 isospin mixing correction being 1.5 to 300 times smaller for the rest of the decays . in the upper @xmath159 shell among the decays between nuclei with mass @xmath155 the @xmath174 decays",
    "is found to be the fastest while the isospin mixing decreases for the other decays 2 to 250 times .",
    "in general , relative to the simplest decay between isobars with four valence nucleons , the parameter - free isospin mixing corrections for the same number of valence nucleons increase with the size of the occupation space .",
    "hence , such a ratio is larger in the @xmath67 major shell than in the @xmath56 single-@xmath171 orbit .",
    "the trend observed allows for estimates for the isospin mixing correction to @xmath2-decay matrix elements between isobars with four to eight valence particles but filling other major shells .",
    "moreover , the present study provides for the order of significance of isospin mixing due to pairing correlations for the decays under consideration if only the @xmath111 mixing correction for the simplest decay is provided by model calculations or experimental observations .",
    "hence large and negligible isospin mixing corrections are easily identified .",
    "for example , in the @xmath56 orbit the @xmath16 model yields @xmath175 for @xmath176 and hence for the fastest @xmath173 decay it is @xmath177 .    in short , the charge dependence of the nuclear force , being a very challenging problem , yields results , based on a simple group - theoretical approach , that are qualitatively as well as quantitatively consistent with the observations .",
    "the @xmath0 algebraic model yields an estimate for the decay rates of possible non - analog @xmath86-decay transitions due to a pure strong interaction , which , though few of them may affect slightly precise calculations , are not expected to comprise the dominant contribution to the isospin - symmetry breaking correction tested in studies of superallowed fermi @xmath86-decay transitions .",

    "<S> the outcome of this study shows the significance of the pairing charge dependence and its role in mixing isospin multiplets of pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath1 states  in light and medium mass nuclei , especially in nuclei with equal numbers of protons and neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> the model reveals possible , but still extremely weak , non - analog @xmath2-decay transitions and estimates their relative strengths within a shell closure . </S>"
