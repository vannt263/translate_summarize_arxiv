    "the allen telescope array ( ata ) , a joint project of the radio astronomy laboratory of the university of california , berkeley , and the seti institute in mountain view , ca , is a radio telescope built on a novel `` lnsd '' ( large number of small dishes ) design @xcite .",
    "it is designed to have a wide field of view ( @xmath75  square degrees  at 1.4ghz ) , enabling rapid surveys of large areas of sky .",
    "this makes it an ideal instrument to search for transient and time - varying radio sources . since survey speed ( the area of sky covered to a given flux density limit in a fixed amount of time ) is proportional to @xmath8 , the product of the number of dishes , @xmath9 , and their diameter , @xmath10 @xcite , this gives the ata a survey speed @xmath11%  that of the very large array .",
    "plans call for the ata s expansion from the existing 42 6m - diameter antennas to a total of 350 antennas , which will result in survey speed an order of magnitude faster still than the current configuration",
    ".    the technical design ( including the novel antennas , feeds , and correlator ) , and some of the early science results , are described by @xcite .",
    "additional early science is described by @xcite as well as other papers in preparation . in this paper",
    "we present the ata twenty - centimeter survey ( atats ) , which consists of observations of 690  square degrees  of sky centered on the @xmath12  square degree  botes  deep field @xcite .",
    "this is a region with a wealth of multi - wavelength data , including data on mid - infrared variability @xcite , which we will compare with radio variability from atats in a future paper .",
    "atats observations were spread over 12 epochs from 2009 january  april ( table  [ tab : epochs ] ) .",
    "each epoch we aimed to observe as many of the 361 atats pointings (   [ sec : design ] ) as possible ; in practice , at a given epoch , good data were obtained for between 252 and 318 pointings ( table  [ tab : epochs ] ) . observing efficiency and telescope uptime",
    "have improved since the atats data were taken . occasionally a given pointing failed for some reason  for example , strong radio frequency interference ( rfi )  and so not all epochs have good data for all pointings observed .",
    "a few observation attempts resulted in corrupted data or no data at all , due to software , hardware , or calibration problems .",

    "atats was designed to verify the performance of the ata during commissioning ( by comparison to existing sky survey data ) as well as to search for time - varying and transient sources .",
    "the survey was designed to cover large areas at a comparatively low sensitivity .    here",
    "we distinguish between sources which are normally above the flux density limit ( which we term `` variable '' and `` non - variable '' , depending on whether or not changes in their flux density are detectable from epoch to epoch ",
    "although most radio sources are intrinsically variable to some degree ) and those which have no quiescent radio counterpart ( which we term `` transient '' ) .",
    "there is obviously some overlap between transient and variable sources , in that some sources which exhibit large outbursts can be seen in quiescent radio emission if observed to faint enough flux densities .",
    "but it is useful ( particularly when comparing catalogs taken at different epochs ) to distinguish between variable sources which are present in most or all epochs ( often rotating sources , or sources with variable accretion rates or magnetic fields ) , and transients which appear above the detection limit at one or a few epochs , and are undetected at others ( often explosive events ) .",
    "variable and transient sources manifest on a range of different timescales in the radio .",
    "_ transients _ have been observed with timescales from milliseconds @xcite to months @xcite , from a range of progenitors .",
    "these include gamma ray bursts @xcite and radio supernovae @xcite  where the progenitor is destroyed  and flares from a variety of objects , which may or may not also show up as variable sources during their more quiescent periods .",
    "flares are seen from active galactic nuclei ( agns ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at one end of the size scale , to m - dwarfs @xcite , brown dwarfs @xcite , pulsars @xcite , and rotating radio transients ( rrats ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the other .",
    "some radio transients @xcite[sec : archival ] show no counterparts in very deep observations at other wavelengths ; these may be flares from isolated old neutron stars @xcite or perhaps something more exotic .",

    "the @xcite transients are now thought to perhaps be due to terrestrial lightning @xcite , although astrophysical interpretations are not yet completely ruled out .    _",
    "variable sources _ at radio wavelengths are also associated with several different classes of object and characteristic timescale .",
    "stars often exhibit variable radio emission @xcite , as do pulsars @xcite , microquasars @xcite , and agns .",
    "agns make up almost all of the sources seen in imaging surveys above a few mjy at 1.4ghz @xcite , and vary over a range of timescales . some agns exhibit intraday variability ( idv )  scintillation of extremely compact components due to extrinsic sources , likely located in our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "this can cause flux changes ranging from a few percent , up to 50%  in so - called extreme scattering events @xcite .    on timescales of months",
    ", radio synchrotron emission is sometimes seen to vary in correlation with optical @xcite or x - ray @xcite emission , as uneven accretion rates from the in - spiraling disk propagate through to knots in the outflowing jets ; on timescales of years , even more substantial variations in accretion rate , heating of material , and reprocessing of energy released in the accretion disk can occur .",
    "long - term variability of very bright agns ( @xmath13jy ) has been systematically explored ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there has not been systematic characterization of the fainter agn population . some faint agns such as iii  zw  2 show extreme variations @xcite . and over periods of @xmath14yr , quasar activity",
    "is thought to switch on and off @xcite , although the duty cycle is not well understood and accretion may stop and start several times over such periods @xcite .",
    "the cadence , frequency , and sensitivity of the observations influences what kind of variable and transient objects will be seen in a given survey .",
    "we selected an extragalactic field , which we observed at 1.4ghz to relatively low sensitivity , with a cadence of a few days to weeks , so almost all variable and non - variable sources seen are agns , and any transients would be likely to be radio supernovae or gamma ray bursts , although some sources may be members of other classes of object discussed above , or even more exotic objects .",
    "the ata has 42 dual - polarization antennas , but the atats survey was undertaken during a period when the array was still being commissioned , and at times , various feeds were disconnected , being retrofitted ( to improve electrical connections in the feed tip circuit board ) , or otherwise not in operation , so not all antennas , baselines , or polarizations were present in all datasets . in any case , at the time of these observations , the correlator was only capable of calculating correlations of 64 inputs ( either 32 dual - polarization feeds , or some other combination of 64 single - polarization inputs from the 42 antennas ) . out of a possible 861 baselines (",
    "each with two polarizations ) the correlator was therefore capable of producing correlations for 496 . due to the fact that not all 64 inputs were populated with good feeds at the time of the observations ,",
    "the mean number of baselines present in the atats dataset is 340 , representing an efficiency of 39% .",
    "since the atats data were taken , improvements in the feeds , and the installation of a second 64-input correlator , have increased the efficiency substantially .",
    "some of the atats data were later flagged due to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) or other problems (   [ sec : rfi ] ) , reducing the observing efficiency still further .",
    "nevertheless , we were still able to achieve good throughput in terms of the product of the area surveyed and the sensitivity reached , and as noted , the observing efficiency of the ata continues to improve , and has the potential to improve even more dramatically if more antennas are added to the array .",
    "the layout of the atats pointings , and the sequence in which they were observed , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pointings ] .",
    "pointings were arranged to approximate a hexagonal close - packed grid , with the spacing between pointing centers determined by nyquist sampling , and accounting for the convergence of lines of constant right ascension towards the poles .",
    "each pointing was imaged once per epoch as a snapshot observation , with an integration time of 60s ( @xmath15s scans ) .",
    "every 50 minutes , the calibrator 3c286 was observed for 60s , as well as once at the completion of each epoch .",
    "observing always started with pointing number 1 , and continued until the end of the scheduled observing time , usually around 12 hours .",
    "the correlator provided 1024 frequency channels , each of width 102khz , across a 104.9mhz - wide band centered at 1430mhz .",
    "the 100 channels at each edge of the band were flagged a priori because of poor sensitivity due to filter roll - off , so the effective bandwidth was 84.4mhz .",
    "the field centers of the 361 atats pointings . ]",
    "as the number of antennas and the volumes of data from radio telescopes increase , calibration , imaging , and flagging rfi by hand start to become impractical . as a result",
    ", automated routines are required to get the best results from the data .",
    "data reduction was undertaken using a software suite developed for the reduction of ata data , rapid ( rapid automated processing and imaging of data ; * ? ? ?",
    "rapid consists of c shell scripts that call miriad @xcite tasks .",
    "it performs identification and excision of rfi , calibrates the visibilities using a primary flux calibrator , and images the individual pointings .",
    "it then performs phase self - calibration and amplitude flagging .",
    "rapid currently operates only on ata data but is freely available by contacting the authors .",
    "mosaicking , catalog creation , and matching to nvss are performed by additional custom - written scripts .",
    "rapid is able to detect and flag rfi on a channel - by - channel basis by looking for channels that often rise above the mean amplitude for all cross - correlations .",
    "rapid also identifies any problem antennas that show signs of corrupted spectra , and flags them .",
    "it then makes an image of the calibrator , using full multifrequency synthesis ( to avoid bandwidth smearing ) , and iteratively tests for phase and amplitude closure , flags data outside of a certain amplitude range , and makes a new image .",
    "once all baselines fall within phase rms and closure limits , iteration stops and an image of the calibrator is produced .",
    "baselines that were determined to be bad in the calibrator data are also flagged in the source data .",
    "rapid then makes images of the source fields , and iteratively applies phase self - calibration and amplitude flagging while attempting to maximize the image dynamic range .",
    "once a maximum in dynamic range is achieved , iteration stops - for our images , this results in a median number of clean components per image of 5710 , a median rms of 3.56mjy  beam@xmath1  ( 2.2 times the theoretical rms of 1.6mjy  beam@xmath1 ) , and a median dynamic range of 120 .",
    "images were made using natural weighting which gives about a factor 3 lower noise than uniform weighting for the ata .",
    "superuniform weighting was also tried , but the results were unsatisfactory , both in terms of image quality , and much higher noise than natural weighting .",
    "the data were calibrated using 3c286 .",
    "the calibrator flux density was determined to be 14.679jy , using the @xcite coefficients .",
    "we did not perform a polarization calibration .",
    "the ata produces cross - polarization data , but at the time of this work , the calibration and analysis of the cross - polarization data have not been fully tested .",
    "3c286 is @xmath16 polarized , but since both x and y polarizations are present in the data , the effect of source polarization on stokes i flux densities is largely cancelled ; ignoring polarization calibration will lead to an additional @xmath17 uncertainty in flux density .",
    "this is negligible compared to other sources of error .",
    "the flagged visibility data , the bandpasses , and the final images were all inspected by eye , but usually rapid does a sufficiently good job ( given optimal input parameters ) that little human interaction is required . where artifacts were visible in the final images , or rfi or other bad data remained in the visibilities , additional manual flagging was performed .",
    "[ sec : rfi]for the 12 good datasets an average of 40.6%  of visibilities were flagged  this includes rfi , the 200 edge channels , and other bad data identified during data reduction . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : design ] , the ata was operating at only 39%  of its maximum capacity during atats , so the fraction of data obtained compared to the technical specifications was 23% .",
    "this fraction is now increasing as additional retrofitted feeds are brought online and other technical improvements are made , which will improve the fidelity of future surveys such as pigss ( the pi ghz sky survey ; bower et  al .  in prep . ) .",
    "the size of the images made for each pointing was @xmath18 pixels , where each pixel was @xmath19 .",
    "the data for all 12 epochs for each pointing were included in each image , since the much better @xmath20  coverage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uvcover ] ) provides for much better image fidelity .",
    "not all pointings had good data at all epochs ( for example , because of a failed observation , or severe corruption by rfi).[sec : corruptreg ] some had bad data at all epochs because they were close to very bright sources  in particular , in the regions surrounding 3c286 and 3c295 .",

    "these measurements give consistent results for the fwhm at 1.4ghz of 150 .",
    "we approximated the primary beam by a gaussian model .",
    "we also experimented with varying the primary beam fwhm value used for mosaicking over a range of values , and found that the canonical value of 150  gave us the most accurate and precise fluxes for nvss sources in our data , and so this value was adopted for our analysis .",
    "we applied the primary beam correction to the images of each good pointing .    where the primary beam is well modeled , and where data volumes are small , joint deconvolution ( where the entire mosaic is imaged and cleaned at once ) is generally desirable to maximize image fidelity .",
    "atats uses snapshot observations ( where @xmath20  coverage is not as good ) , and the primary beam model used is not as sophisticated , so better quality images can be obtained by imaging of individual fields , and subsequent mosaicking . in any case , the large amount of atats data would make joint deconvolution of the entire mosaic difficult without some averaging of the input visibilities ( which risks degradation of image quality ) .",
    "we made a linear mosaic of the 243 individual primary - beam corrected images , masking each outside a radius corresponding to the nominal half - power points ( 75 ) , in order to avoid exaggerating the effects of the deviation of the true primary beam from a gaussian at large distances from the pointing center ( in particular , the @xmath27 sidelobes ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the final image was transformed to a gls ( global sinusoid ) geometry , which has the property that each pixel subtends an equal area on the sky .",
    "this is important for an image covering such a large area , since the curvature of the sky introduces distortions . in projections that do not preserve area ,",
    "the size of the beam would change across the mosaic , resulting in errors in the integrated flux densities reported by the source fitting procedure .",
    "if we were not to perform this transformation on the atats mosaic , we would bias the flux densities of the sources low by around @xmath28 , and increase the scatter in the measured flux densities by @xmath29 when compared to nvss .    the rms noise in this final 12-epoch image , which we term the `` master mosaic '' , is 3.94mjy  beam@xmath1 .",
    "the dynamic range , determined by dividing the peak flux density of the brighest source in our map ( 4.14jy ) by the rms noise in a 100-pixel box surrounding this source ( 23.0mjy ) is 180 .",

    "<S> we present the allen telescope array twenty - centimeter survey ( atats ) , a multi - epoch ( 12 visits ) , 690  square degree  radio image and catalog at 1.4ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is designed to detect rare , very bright transients as well as to verify the capabilities of the ata to form large mosaics . </S>",
    "<S> the combined image using data from all 12 atats epochs has rms noise @xmath0mjy  beam@xmath1  and dynamic range 180 , with a circular beam of 150  fwhm . </S>",
    "<S> it contains 4408 sources to a limiting sensitivity of @xmath2mjy  beam@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the catalog generated from this 12-epoch combined image to the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) , a legacy survey at the same frequency , and find that we can measure source positions to better than @xmath3 . for sources above the atats completeness limit , </S>",
    "<S> the median flux density is 97%  of the median value for matched nvss sources , indicative of an accurate overall flux calibration . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the effects of source confusion due to the effects of differing resolution between atats and nvss on our ability to compare flux densities . </S>",
    "<S> we detect no transients at flux densities greater than 40mjy in comparison with nvss , and place a @xmath4 upper limit on the transient rate for such sources of 0.004deg@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the @xmath6jy transients reported by @xcite may not be true transients , but rather variable sources at their flux density threshold . </S>"
