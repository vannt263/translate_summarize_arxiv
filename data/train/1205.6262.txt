    "over the past few years , a novel direction in the study of bose - einstein condensation has captured a considerable amount of attention .",
    "this concerns the observation of exciton - polariton bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in semiconductor microcavities @xcite .",
    "a fundamental feature of these exciton - polariton becs is that , upon confinement , the excitons ( bound pairs of electrons and holes ) couple strongly to the incident light creating the polariton quasi - particles  @xcite .",
    "the resulting exciton - polariton bec possesses a number of remarkable properties that we briefly touch upon below .",
    "the radiative lifetime of the polaritons is the shorter relaxation time scale of the system being of the order of 110  ps  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the light mass of the exciton - polaritons provides this system with a significantly higher condensation temperature .",
    "the photonic component of the exciton - polaritons is responsible for their short lifetime which , in turn , does not allow thermalization ; instead , it produces a non - equilibrium condensate , wherein the presence of external pumping from an exciton reservoir is critical towards a counter - balance of the polariton loss . in such genuinely non - equilibrium condensates ,",
    "numerous remarkable features have been not only theoretically predicted but also experimentally established ; these include the flow without scattering ( analog of the flow without friction ) @xcite , the existence of vortices @xcite ( see also ref .  @xcite for vortex dipole dynamics and ref .",
    "@xcite for observations thereof ) , the collective dynamics @xcite , as well as remarkable applications such as spin switches @xcite and light emitting diodes @xcite operating even near room temperatures .",
    "perhaps the most customary approach to modeling exciton - polariton becs involves the coupling of the evolution of the polaritons to that of the exciton reservoir which enables their production ( and which features diffusive spatial dynamics of the excitons ) ; this way , the model takes the form of two coupled complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations describing the evolution of exciton and photon wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite that a single cgl equation for the macroscopically occupied polariton state can also be used in a way consistent with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was followed in ref .",
    "@xcite where a bec of magnon quasi - particles , incorporating a source term rather than an amplification of the field , was shown to be phenomenologically described by a system two nonlinearly coupled cgl - type equations . in the context of the single cgl model for the polaritons , there exists a localized ( pumping ) region of gain and a nonlinear saturating loss term , in addition to all the standard terms ( quantum pressure , external parabolic trapping and repulsive interatomic interaction ) that one encounters in atomic becs  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be pointed out that the prototypical setting where experiments have been conducted is two - dimensional in nature . yet",
    ", highly anisotropic traps ( similar to what has been done in atomic becs  @xcite ) can be envisioned which reduce the effective dynamics to a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent experimental advances have enabled the use of thin microwires in order to guide the condensates along the direction of the wire  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , the recent analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite presented a number of striking characteristics due to the interplay of gain and loss terms with the standard ones of atomic becs .",
    "prominent examples included the destabilization of the nodeless state of the system and the creation of stability inversions ( where states with nodes would be more robust ) , as well as the existence of bubble - like and sawtooth - like solutions in the system .    a very interesting research direction in the physics of atomic and polariton becs concerns the dynamics of the condensates in a double - well potential .",
    "the latter can be created in atomic bec experiments through the combination of a parabolic trap and a periodic ( so - called optical lattice ) potential generated through the interference of laser beams illuminating the bec  @xcite .",
    "relevant experiments in atomic becs  @xcite have paved the way towards the exploration of numerous features such as tunneling and josephson oscillations for small numbers of atoms in the condensate , and macroscopic quantum self - trapped states , as well as symmetry - breaking effects for large atom numbers . on the other hand ,",
    "double - well potentials can also be created in polariton bec experiments in microcavities by applying stress @xcite , by employing photolithographic techniques @xcite , or allowing natural formation during the sample growth @xcite .",
    "importantly , the latter technique was used for the study of a `` polariton josephson junction '' @xcite , in the spirit of earlier studies on `` bosonic josephson junctions '' @xcite in the context of atomic becs .",
    "importantly , a large volume of theoretical studies has accompanied these developments , first in the context of atomic becs , through investigations related to finite - mode reductions and symmetry - breaking bifurcations  @xcite , quantum effects  @xcite , and nonlinear variants of the double - well potential @xcite , and more recently in the context of polariton condensates , especially as concerns josephson oscillations therein @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned in passing that similar ( spontaneous symmetry breaking ) effects have been monitored in the realm of nonlinear optics : in this context , formation of asymmetric states in dual - core fibers @xcite , self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite , and optically - induced dual - core waveguiding structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite have been reported .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to combine these two themes , namely the focus on the exciton - polariton bec with pumping and loss and the fundamental interest in the understanding of double - well trapping potentials in a spirit similar to the proposal of ref .",
    "in particular , we will consider the single - component model of refs .",
    "@xcite combined with a double - well potential in a quasi-1d ( e.g. , microwire ) setting",
    ". we will attempt a systematic ( galerkin ) finite - dimensional reduction of the system via projection to the two principal eigenstates of the potential , and will derive a damped - driven system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that have been shown in the hamiltonian case to capture the essence of the statics  @xcite and dynamics  @xcite of double - well potentials .",
    "we will then examine the bifurcation structure of the resulting odes and compare it to that of the original partial differential equation ( pde ) model .",
    "this already provides us with a number of interesting features that distinguish this system from its hamiltonian analog .",
    "for instance , in the case of attractive interatomic interactions ( which is studied together with that of repulsive interactions ) the relevant symmetry - breaking pitchfork bifurcation is subcritical instead of supercritical as in the hamiltonian case .",
    "furthermore , both branches that emerge from the pitchfork bifurcations , the stable asymmetric one and the ( now ) unstable `` parent '' branch , both appear to become destabilized in this polariton bec setting for slightly larger nonlinearities , posing the natural question of what is the stable dynamics for larger values of the nonlinearity .",
    "these questions will in part be addressed via direct numerical simulations .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows .",
    "first , in section ii , we will present the model and its theoretical study via the galerkin analysis . in section iii , we will study the model numerically and compare the results of the numerical bifurcation analysis with the prediction of the galerkin approximation .",
    "we will also complement these results with direct numerical simulations of the original model . finally , in section iv",
    ", we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "in our analysis below , we adopt the model of refs .",
    "it has been argued in these works that the original exciton - polariton system given by a set of two coupled equations can be effectively reduced to a single cgl equation with a nonlinear saturating loss term .",
    "this reduction can be used when the reservoir mean - field potential is negligible and the spot size is large compared with the condensate size ( i.e. , if we can consider that the spot width is the same of the spatial extent of the system ) . in particular , the amplification of the existing field introduces a gain and hence acts as a generator of polaritons .",
    "then the loss term saturates this gain beyond a certain threshold .",
    "these two terms are analogous to the pumping of polaritons from the excitons and to the natural decay of the polaritons .",
    "this reduced model can be expressed in dimensionless form as follows : @xmath0u .",

    "more specifically , in the context of polariton condensates , eq .  ( [ eq : gpeq1 ] ) incorporates ( a ) the spatially dependent gain term of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the step function generating a symmetric pumping spot of `` radius '' @xmath6 and strength @xmath7 for the gain , and ( b ) a nonlinear saturation loss term , characterized by its strength @xmath8 . as concerns the parameter @xmath9",

    "the value of @xmath12 depends on the atom species ( e.g. , @xmath10 for @xmath13rb or @xmath14na , while @xmath11 for @xmath15li or @xmath16rb atoms ) . on the other hand , in the context of polariton condensates",

    "[ fig : dynatt ] and [ fig : dynattnew ] . in the former case , when the emerging asymmetric branch is unstable the dynamics typically is found to lead to the stable ground state of the system ( the symmetric one ) . on the other hand ,",
    "for the attractive case , when both the symmetric and the asymmetric branch are destabilized , the dynamics does not resort to the excited ( yet stable ) anti - symmetric state .",
    "instead , it leads to periodic oscillations in the density between the two wells .",
    "finally , we have considered the effect of varying the spot size fixing @xmath115 . in the repulsive case ,",
    "the symmetric branch is stable for @xmath131 $ ] ; out of this range , the instabilities are caused by a hopf bifurcation cascade and develop into non - stationary multi - dark soliton waveforms , similar to the states that were previously reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( but for a purely parabolic trap ) . the anti - symmetric branch , which is unstable for every @xmath6 ( for this value of @xmath8 ) , experiences a bifurcation cascade for @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the instabilities at @xmath134 are the exponential ones previously explored . however , considering higher values of @xmath8 , a stability range appears which is enlarged for growing @xmath8 . a similar effect is observed for the asymmetric branch , i.e. , there is a small stability interval @xmath135 $ ] that is enlarged when @xmath8 is decreased . outside this range ,",
    "the branch experiences hopf bifurcation cascades .",
    "the above mentioned scenario is almost equivalent for the attractive case , except that the symmetric and anti - symmetric branches are interchanged . in that case , the anti - symmetric branch is stable for @xmath136 $ ] ; the symmetric branch is now stable for @xmath137 $ ] , starting the hopf cascade at @xmath138 .",
    "the asymmetric branch is stable for @xmath139 $ ] , while being oscillatorily unstable for other values of @xmath6 .",
    "in the present work , we studied the existence of solutions , their spectral stability and nonlinear dynamics for the case of a polariton condensate confined in a quasi-1d double well potential .",
    "motivated by recent developments for the study of polaritons in such settings @xcite , and by the work of ref .",
    "@xcite which proposed a two - well model , we presented a systematic galerkin analysis for the model with the gain over a localized spot and nonlinear saturation loss formulated in refs .",
    "it was theoretically predicted that nonlinear states emanate from the corresponding linear ones of the potential and that bifurcations are expected to arise , similarly to the hamiltonian analog of this setting studied earlier in the context of atomic becs .",
    "such symmetry breaking pitchfork events emerge from the anti - symmetric , first excited state in the case of the repulsive interactions , while they arise from the symmetric ground state branch in the case of attractive ones . despite the similarities with the atomic bec case ,",
    "nontrivial differences exist as well .",
    "one of them concerns the nature of the bifurcation , which in the attractive case was found to be weakly subcritical ( instead of supercritical ) upon decrease of the chemical potential .",
    "importantly also , the resulting asymmetric branches aside from narrow intervals of stability are generically found to be unstable due to genuine hopf bifurcations , which , in turn , give rise to periodic orbits ( in the density ) . while in the repulsive case , the dynamics of anti - symmetric and asymmetric branches is found to be attracted to the ground state when both of them are unstable , the periodic orbits are essential to the evolution in the case of attractive interactions as they seem to constitute the robust dynamical attractor .",
    "this is merely the first step in the examination of the similarities ( but also the differences ) of the polariton becs and their atomic counterparts within a setting that contains the interplay of a double - well potential and nonlinear interactions . yet",
    ", our study paves the way for a number of potential future avenues . on the one hand",
    ", one can consider the more detailed model of refs .",
    "@xcite and examine whether the inclusion of the diffusive dynamics of the exciton population induces any qualitative differences in the features reported herein . on the other hand , and bearing in mind the predominantly two - dimensional nature of the polariton dynamics , one can envision generalizations of the potential considered herein in a 2d realm .",
    "relevant possibilities may include not only the straightforward generalization of a double well encompassing two quasi - one - dimensional tracks , but also that of a genuinely two - dimensional four well potential that has recently been examined in detail in atomic becs  @xcite . even in the context of the present model , there are further possibilities to explore , including the systematic investigation of the emergent periodic orbits and their floquet spectral stability analysis .",
    "such studies are currently in progress and will be reported in future publications .",
