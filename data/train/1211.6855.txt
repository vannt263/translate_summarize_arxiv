    "the first stars fundamentally transform the early universe by emitting the first light and also by synthesizing and dispersing the first heavy elements .",
    "they initiate cosmic reionization , and set the scene for the subsequent formation of the first galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) . understanding how and when the first stars were formed is one of the important goals of modern astronomy .",
    "there has been a significant progress over the past years in the theoretical studies on the first stars . with the currently available computer power",
    ", one can perform an _ ab initio _ simulation of the first star formation in substantial details ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of a primordial protostar in a proper cosmological context .",
    "@xcite showed that a primordial gas cloud can fragment into multiple clumps by the action of the rotation and turbulence in the cloud .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used sink - particle techniques to follow the evolution of the accretion disk around a primordial protostar for hundreds years .",
    "it was shown that the circumstellar disk around a protostar becomes gravitationally unstable to form multiple protostars .",
    "unfortunately , these simulations could not be run long enough to obtain the solid prediction for multiplicity and for the characteristic mass of the first stars . including the so - called proto - stellar feedback effects is important to determine the mass of the first stars @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed radiation - hydrodynamical calculations to show that the self - regulating proto - stellar feedback halts the growth of a primordial protostar when its mass is several tens of solar - masses .",
    "it has become possible to follow the entire evolution of a primordial protostar to the main - sequence and thus to discuss rigorously important issues such as the characteristic mass of the first stars .",
    "there still remain a few uncertainties in these theoretical studies on primordial star formation .",
    "for example , some of the important chemical reaction rates in a pre - stellar gas are not known to good accuracies @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the three - body hydrogen molecule formation rate is poorly determined , which leaves substantial uncertainties in the thermal evolution of a pre - stellar gas at high densities @xcite .",
    "calculating radiative cooling rates at such high densities , where the gas is optically thick , is essentially a radiative transfer problem .",
    "previous studies adopt two methods to solve this problem .",
    "fitting functions are proposed by @xcite which describes the net cooling rate as a function of the local density based on the result of a fully one - dimensional ( 1d ) radiative transfer calculation .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",

    "a gravitationally contracting primordial gas evolves roughly isothermally . since the onset of run - away collapse , the temperature rises only a factor of about ten whereas the density increases over 16 orders of magnitudes @xcite .",
    "in a primordial gas , the main coolant is hydrogen molecules ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "there are two important regimes where radiative transfer effects become important .",
    "one is at densities @xmath2 , where @xmath0 line cooling is dominant and the cloud core cools and condenses rapidly .",
    "then the cloud core becomes optically - thick to @xmath0 lines .",
    "it is known that the chemo - thermal instability can be triggered in this phase @xcite .",
    "the other is at densities @xmath3 , where the gas is nearly opaque to @xmath4 line photons but cooling by the collision - induced emission ( cie ) becomes efficient .    in order to compute the net radiative cooling rate in the two regimes",
    ", we need to compute the opacity for photons in a broad energy range . in principle , the gas opacity depends on a number of physical quantities such as the local gas density , temperature , and velocities .",
    "when the gas density exceeds @xmath5 , rapid three - body reactions of h@xmath6 formation convert nearly all the hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecules .",
    "then h@xmath6 line cooling becomes highly efficient .",
    "as the gas cloud condenses , however , the gas cloud core becomes opaque to h@xmath6 lines .",
    "then the h@xmath6 line cooling rate is calculated as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy difference between the upper level @xmath9 and the lower level @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the escape probability for a photon without absorption , @xmath12 is the einstein coefficient for the spontaneous transition , and @xmath13 is the number density of the hydrogen molecule in the upper level @xmath9 . to calculate the escape probability @xmath14 , we evaluate the opacity for each h@xmath6 line as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the absorption coefficient for the transition from @xmath10 to @xmath9 level . calculating the characteristic absorption length scale , @xmath17 , is the remaining task . to this end",

    "we examine the effect of varying the three - body reaction rate at the end of this section .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the radial profiles of five physical quantities for run a when the central density is @xmath23 . at this time , the central part is nearly completely opaque to h@xmath6 line emission .",
    "the solid line shows the result from the run with the 3d opacity calculation ( sobolev method , equation [ [ eq : h2_line ] ] ) and the dotted line is for the run with the fitting opacity formula ( equation [ [ eq : line_cooling_rate_thick ] ] ) .",
    "we see significant differences in the temperature , radial velocity , and accretion rate profiles .    because the photon escape probability depends on the local velocity gradient ( see equation [ [ eq : sobolev_length ] ] )",
    ", the line cooling rate can be large if the velocity gradient is large in the dense cloud core .",
    "the radial infall velocity is critically affected by the degree of rotation of the collapsing cloud .",
    "star - forming clouds in a cosmological simulation generically have finite initial angular momenta and thus they spin up gradually as they collapse gravitationally . the radial infall velocity , @xmath20 , and the velocity gradient , @xmath64 , in such rotating gas clouds are smaller than realized in spherically symmetric collapse .",
    "thus the escape probability in the cosmological simulation is smaller than the fitting formula predicts .    in order to investigate further the difference in the escape probability",
    ", we perform a spherical collapse simulation with 3d set - up .",
    "we follow gravitational collapse of a super - critical bonnor - ebert sphere having a mass of @xmath65 . for this run",
    ", we calculate the h@xmath6 line opacity using the sobolev method .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f3 ] ( dashed line in each panel ) .",
    "clearly , the radial velocity of the run is larger than that of our cosmological simulation run a , which has a substantial degree of rotation .",
    "this is the major source of the differences in the line escape probability and in the cooling rate , as shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f4 ] shows the escape probability of h@xmath6 line photons as a function of the gas density .",
    "we show three snapshots for the mean profiles ( solid lines ) when the central density is @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the escape probability calculated by our 3d treatment is smaller than the fitting formula ( dotted line ) most of the time .",
    "the difference is as large as a factor of ten at the densest part .",
    "the fitting formula over - estimates the net cooling rate .",
    "this is easily understood by the collapse speed of the spherically symmetric calculation .",
    "next , let us consider the direction - dependence of the escape probability . in the left panel of figure [ f4 ]",
    ", we plot the escape probability in the direction along @xmath68 and @xmath69-axes ( long - dashed , short - dashed , and dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "we configure the coordinate such that the @xmath69-direction is aligned to the angular momentum vector of the central cloud core . and",
    "[ f2 ] also use the same coordinate . ]",
    "the escape probability is large along the @xmath69-direction .",
    "thus , physically , line photons preferentially escape in perpendicular directions to the flattened cloud core .",
    "it is important to note that the difference ( or mis - estimate ) in the cooling rate critically affects the collapse dynamics .",
    "the right panel of figure [ f4 ] shows the time evolution of the central density since the central density reaches @xmath70 . in the run with the fitting formula",
    ", the cloud core collapses earlier by @xmath71 years , i.e. , the gravitational collapse is accelerated because of the `` efficient '' cooling .",
    "figures [ f5 ] and [ f6 ] show the same results for run b , which has a spiral structure .",
    "the overall evolutionary trend is quite similar to run a. clearly , the importance of radiative transfer effects is not particular to the configuration of run a. the differences in the radial profiles of run b are understood similarly to run a as explained in the present section .",
    "we conclude that the multi - dimensional treatment for the radiative cooling is important to follow the thermal evolution and the gravitational collapse accurately .",
    "next , we discuss the thermal evolution through the phase where cie cooling is important . in this subsection , we primarily discuss the results of run b. the radial profiles when the central density is @xmath72 are shown in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "we also plot the normalized cooling rate , the efficiency factor @xmath73 and the time evolution of the central density in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f8 ] shows similar features to the case of @xmath0 line opacity discussed in the previous section .",
    "we a significant direction - dependence of the escape probability .",
    "the fitting formula over - estimates the net cooling rate compared with the run with our 3d opacity treatment .",
    "the difference in the net cooling rate becomes as large as a factor of 5 at @xmath74 .",
    "the gas collapses faster with the fitting formula for the opacity calculation .",
    "however , the difference in the resulting collapse time is not very large ( see the right panel of figure [ f8 ] ) .",
    "the time difference is only about 1 year at the end of the calculations .",
    "it is worth pursuing the reason why the collapse proceeds similarly in the two cases despite the large difference in the net cooling rate in the relevant regime @xmath75 . to this end",
    ", we perform two additional calculations for run b. one is run with an artificially increased cie cooling rate as @xmath76 whereas the other is run with the reduced efficiency factor @xmath77 .",
    "the other configurations are identical to run b , and the opacity calculations are also done using 3d ray - tracing .",
    "therefore , we expect that the two runs clarify the impact of enhanced / reduced cie cooling .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ f9 ] . in the case with the increased cooling rate ,",
    "the collapsing gas evolves on a lower temperature track ( the long - dashed line in figure [ f9 ] ) , as is naively expected from the enhanced cooling rate .",
    "clearly , the cooling rate itself directly affects the gas temperature in this regime . on the other hand",
    ", the effect of decreasing the efficiency factor appears relatively small ( the short - dashed line ) .",
    "the cloud evolves on a slightly higher temperature track , but the difference is significant only in a narrow range of density , @xmath78 , where the gas is collapsing rapidly .",
    "the free - fall time there is estimated to be @xmath79 which is comparative to the cooling time .",
    "the core condenses quickly and becomes optically thick to the continuum photons after the central density reaches @xmath80 . in the left panel of figure [ f8 ] ,",
    "we also plot the time evolution of the cooling efficiency at the central part ( double - dotted line ) .",
    "the evolution looks similar to the fitting function at the high density .    in summary ,",
    "the accuracy of the continuum opacity calculation causes only minor effect on the thermal evolution .",
    "the difference in @xmath73 is large between the methods , but the resulting evolution is not sensitive to the details of the methods .",
    "it should be noted , however , that we have considered only a particular case in which the central core undergoes rapid run - away collapse . in other circumstances , for example in an accretion disk around a protostar where the density evolution is much slower than in the collapsing gas core that we have studied , accurate calculations of the optically - thick cooling may be more important .",
    "it is well known that there is a large uncertainty in the reaction rate of the three - body h@xmath6 formation @xmath81 because this is the dominant reaction to form hydrogen molecules at high densities ( @xmath82 ) , an accurate reaction rate is needed to determine the chemical and thermal evolution of a primordial gas cloud .",
    "@xcite summarize various rate coefficients used in the literature , which differ by a factor of 30 at the relevant temperature range .",
    "@xcite perform a set of hydrodynamical simulations to directly study the overall effect caused by the uncertainties in the reaction rate .",
    "they conclude that , while the difference between different realizations ( gas cloud samples ) is larger than that caused by the uncertainty of the three - body rate coefficient , the morphology and the collapse time of a gas cloud depend strongly on the reaction rate .    in this section ,",
    "we revisit the issue because the density range where the uncertainties are relevant is coincident with the range where the radiative transfer treatment is important , as studied in the previous sections .",
    "we are able to compare the overall differences caused by the uncertainties of the reaction rates with the differences caused by radiative transfer treatments .",
    "so far in the present paper , we have adopted the reaction rate from @xcite ( @xmath83 case in figure [ f10 ] ) .",
    "we run the same simulation as run b but with the different three - body reaction rates of @xcite ( @xmath84 ) and @xcite ( @xmath85 ) , which are the largest and smallest reaction rates among those compiled by @xcite .",
    "the respective rates are summarized in figure [ f10 ] and table [ t1 ] .",
    "figure [ f11 ] shows the simulation results with the three reaction rates .",
    "the left panel shows the h@xmath6 fraction as a function of gas density .",
    "the density at which the cloud becomes fully - molecular differs more than a factor of 10 .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "because the molecular fraction largely determines the h@xmath6 line cooling rate , the resulting collapse time of the cloud differs by @xmath86 years , depending on the choice of the reaction rate .",
    "it is interesting that the time difference of the cloud collapse , @xmath87 , is comparable to the difference caused by the choice of the opacity calculation method .",
    "the difference in the molecular fraction becomes large at @xmath88 , where the calculation of the h@xmath6 line opacity is important ( see figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we argue that using an accurate radiative transfer method is as important as using an accurate reaction rate .",
    "radiative cooling by hydrogen molecules governs the thermal evolution of a primordial star - forming gas cloud . at high densities ,",
    "the cloud core becomes optically thick to both the rot - vibrational lines and collision - induced continuum .",
    "it is necessary to estimate the gas opacities in multiple directions in order to calculate the radiative cooling rates accurately .",
    "we have explicitly compared the results from several sets of simulations with different manners to calculate the optically - thick cooling rates .",
    "when non - spherical structures develop in the central region of the cloud , photons do not escape isotropically from the dense part .",
    "our simulations show that the gas cloud spins up as it contracts , and forms a flattened disk at the center .",
    "then the photon escape probability not only varies with time but is also direction - dependent . utilizing an `` isotropic ''",
    "fitting formula that is derived from spherically symmetric calculations over - estimates the net cooling rate and causes the cloud core to collapse fast ( see figures [ f4 ] , [ f6 ] , and [ f8 ] ) . with our 3d opacity calculation ,",
    "the photon escape fraction from the cloud core is always smaller than given by the fitting formula .",
    "the resulting cooling rate differs by a factor of a few to 10 , depending on the exact density , temperature , and velocity structure .",
    "there is also a directional effect of the radiative transfer . in perpendicular directions to the faces of the disk - like cloud",
    ", photons can easily escape .",
    "details of the implementation of the optically - thick radiative cooling affects the thermal and dynamical evolution of the cloud .",
    "figure [ f12 ] shows the density distribution of two characteristic runs .",
    "we use the snapshots at 10 years after the central density reaches @xmath89 .",
    "the left panel shows the case with our 3d radiative transfer , whereas the right panel is for the case with the fitting formulae .. we keep the low mass resolution deliberately in order to follow the disk evolution over 10 years . ]",
    "the latter case appears rounder and more concentrated than former , which has a spiral structure . clearly , further detailed studies on radiative transfer effects are needed , particularly on the long - term evolution of the proto - stellar disk .",
    "the exact structure of the proto - stellar disk likely affects the disk evolution , mass accretion rate and fragmentation of the cloud @xcite .",
    "a similar comparative study of radiative cooling implementations has been done by @xcite in the context of the present - day star formation .",
    "interestingly , an opposite trend is found in the case of `` polytropic '' cooling examined by @xcite , which is based on locally estimated opacities .",
    "they show that the polytropic cooling performs well only in spherically symmetric cases .",
    "the polytropic method over - estimates the column density , and hence underestimates the radiative cooling rate in non - spherical cases . in order to calculate radiative cooling rates in 3d simulations , it is important to take the direction - dependence of the photon diffusion into account , similarly to what we conclude in the present paper .",
    "it is clearly advantageous to use a computational method that is fast and robust .",
    "our method of the h@xmath6 line transfer utilizes local velocity gradients that come with essentially no additional cost , because the velocity gradients are already computed and used in the other parts in our smoothed - particle hydrodynamics code . for continuum photons ,",
    "we need to compute the column density along six ( or more ) directions using a costly projection method devised by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the continuum opacity calculation is one of the most time consuming part in our 3d simulations .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that it is necessary to properly take the direction - dependence into account in order to calculate the optically - thick radiative cooling rate accurately .",
    "we also note that our method is based on the so - called escape probability method , which itself is an approximation .",
    "essentially , we assume only the densest part emits continuum photons .",
    "it is desirable to implement fully three - dimensional radiative transfer , by employing advanced methods such as flux - limited diffusion or m1-closure ( e.g. , @xcite ) to follow the long - term evolution of a primordial proto - stellar system .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling are commonly used for the study of the primordial star formation . in such simulations , it is important to use accurate methods to calculate radiative cooling rates .",
    "for example , whether or not a proto - stellar disk fragments is determined by the thermal and gravitational instability of the circumstellar gas .",
    "the disk fragmentation is an important issue which is thought to determine the multiplicity and possibly the characteristic mass of primordial stars .",

    "<S> we study the thermal evolution of primordial star - forming gas clouds using three - dimensional cosmological simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we critically examine how assumptions and approximations made in calculating radiative cooling rates affect the dynamics of the collapsing gas clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two important molecular hydrogen cooling processes that operate in a dense primordial gas ; @xmath0 line cooling and continuum cooling by @xmath0 collision - induced emission . to calculate the optically thick cooling rates </S>",
    "<S> , we follow the sobolev method for the former , whereas we perform ray - tracing for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we also run the same set of simulations using simplified fitting functions for the net cooling rates . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the simulation results in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the time- and direction - dependence of hydrodynamic quantities such as gas temperature and local velocity gradients significantly affects the optically thick cooling rates . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational collapse of the cloud core is accelerated when the cooling rates are calculated by using the fitting functions . </S>",
    "<S> the structure and evolution of the central pre - stellar disk are also affected . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that physically motivated implementations of radiative transfer are necessary to follow accurately the thermal and chemical evolution of a primordial gas to high densities . </S>"
