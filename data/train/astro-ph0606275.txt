    "is the most luminous star in our part of the galaxy and indeed is one of the most mysterious known to us ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) .",
    "it is surrounded by complex ejecta created in several outbursts of the star and an outgoing massive wind with periodic events every 5.54 years ( damineli 1996 ) .",
    "the largest mass ejection occurred during the so - called great eruption observed in the 1840s  which the star survived . in that event , released about 10@xmath2 ergs of kinetic energy contained in more than 10 m@xmath3 of material ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) , which has since expanded to form the bipolar homunculus nebula we see today ( gaviola 1950 ; smith & gehrz 1998 ; morse et al .",
    "2001 ) . despite the hot and very luminous central star ,",
    "the circumstellar nebula is cool enough to produce a remarkably rich emission spectrum of lines from neutral and low ionization species like fe@xmath4 and ni@xmath4 ( davidson et al .  2001 ;",
    "zethson 2001 ; zethson et al.2001 ) , line - of - sight absorption from several neutral and singly ionized atoms ( gull et al .",
    "2005 ) , and even emission from h@xmath5 and very cool dust ( smith 2002a ; smith et al .",
    "in addition to being dense and cool , the ejecta of are nitrogen rich , representing ashes of the cno cycle ( davidson et al .",
    "1982 , 1986 ; smith & morse 2004 ; verner et al .",
    "it is the high density , low - excitation , and cno abundances of the ejecta that make the homunculus a unique laboratory among circumstellar nebulae , having a profound effect on the results discussed in this paper .    in february 1999",
    "a series of stis observations of was made of a region about 1.5 \" northwest of the star ( zethson et al.2001 ) .",
    "the spectrum from this region was significantly different from the nebular emission spectra elsewhere in the homunculus , with two of the lines being identified as forbidden emission of singly - ionized strontium ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the measured velocity of the filament ( @xmath6 km / s ) and its distance from the central star are consistent with the gas having been ejected from the same star during the great eruption .",
    "further spectroscopic observations and a complete list of lines identified in the filament were reported by hartman et al .",
    "they show that lines of fe  i , v  ii , and 2 are strong in the filament , whereas only a few 2 lines are detected .",
    "other lines in the spectrum at about the same velocity come from c  i , mg  i , al  ii , ca  i , ca  ii , sc  ii , cr  ii , mn  ii , co  ii , and 2 .",
    "curiously no h , he , s , o , or n lines are present in this region .",
    "the cosmic abundance of strontium is lower than that of iron and nickel by factors of 30,000 and 3,000 respectively .",
    "thus , strontium emission is normally undetectable in nebular spectra .",
    "the fact that [ 2 ] emission was detected with strengths comparable to those of [ 2 ] and [ 2 ] lines indicates that either strontium is locally overabundant in by orders of magnitude , which is inconsistent with the evidence of cno - cycle - processes ejecta , or very unusual conditions exist in this region of the nebula .    in a recent study of the 2 and [ 2 ] spectra of the filament ( bautista et al.2002 ) we found that [ 2 ] emission may be strongly enhanced by continuum fluorescence , which partially explains the strength of these lines .",
    "although it was not possible at that time to establish the precise abundance of sr , this result did imply that sr might not be as overabundant as previously thought .",
    "this point opened up new questions .",
    "if [ 2 ] lines can be efficiently excited by fluorescence , why are the lines seen only in this structure , but not elsewhere in the homunculus , and not in any other emission line nebulae ?",
    "the observed spatial and velocity distribution of the sr - filament suggests that it is located in the equatorial region between the hourglass - shaped bipolar homunculus ( davidson et al 2001 ; smith 2002a ; ishibashi et al , 2003 ) .",
    "the sr - filament is located at a projected distance of 10 lightdays ( at 2300 pc distance ) , where it should receive intense uv radiation from .",
    "the spectra of the weigelt blobs b and d , located a few light days from , require the spectral flux distribution of an o star with te=35,000k during the 5-year broad maximum ( verner et al.2005 ) .",
    "the sr - filament should receive a diluted amount of this same uv radiation , but its emission line spectrum indicates a much lower ionization condition .",
    "the sr - filament appears to be shielded not only by neutral hydrogen ( 13.6 ev ) , but also singly - ionized iron ( 7.9 ev ) which requires a substantial column density of 2 between and the sr - filament .",
    "one possibility is that the sr - filament is located at the outer side of an apparent optically thick , dusty , torus seen in the mid - ir ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to demonstrate this scenario",
    ", we must determine the nature of a hot star continuum filtered out by an 2 blocking column and predict the physical conditions within the filament that would sustain such a low ionization region .",
    "then we can determine the actual abundances of all species observed in this structure .",
    "in this paper we study the emission spectra of two prominent ions in the filament : 2 and 2 .",
    "2 is studied for the very first time as the relevant atomic data has never before been obtained .",
    "2 emission lines are rarely seen in emission nebulae as its ionization potential , 13.58 ev , leads to ti  iii in most h  ii regions .",
    "2 , often seen in nebular emission spectroscopy , is much better understood and herein serves as a reference ion .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the atomic models built for the 2 and 2 systems , with particular detail in the calculations of atomic parameters that had to be performed for 2 . in section  3 we show the results of the nebular diagnostics . in section  4",
    "we derive the relative abundances of 2 and 2 in gas phase , while in section  5 we discuss possible scenarios of ni and ti depletion in the nebula .",
    "finally , our discussion and conclusions are given in section  6 .",
    "for the present analysis of [ 2 ] spectra we employ a 76-level model for the ion that includes continuum fluorescence excitation as in bautista et al.(1996 ) and improved collisional data reported by bautista ( 2004 ) .",
    "this new collisional data , that results from very extensive calculations , is expected to be more accurate than previous data .      for 2 , neither complete",
    "transitions rates for forbidden transitions nor collision strengths had been reported , thus large calculations of atomic data for this ion were carried out within the present work .",

    "the @xmath53 s were computed for various temperatures between 5000 and 20  000k to be used in the calculation of excitation rates .",
    "we built an 82-level excitation equilibrium model for 2 which considers both electron impact excitation and continuum fluorescence excitation .",
    "a model of this size is large enough to account for collisionally excited emission at the temperatures of interest ( @xmath54 k ) , and the dominant photoexcitation channels from the ground level .",
    "if more levels were included in our models they would tend to increase the efficiency of continuum fluorescence excitation , although it has been shown that the contribution of individual levels decreases rapidly with the level energy ( bautista et al .",
    "we assume that the radiation field density , @xmath55 , at photon energies below the lyman ionization limit ( 13.6 ev ) can be approximated by a blackbody with temperature @xmath56 times a geometrical dilution factor @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 for the present calculations we adopt a blackbody temperature of 35  000k ( see verner et al.2005 ) while the dilution factor is diagnosed from the observed spectra .",
    "a different choice in the blackbody temperature would lead to a change in the diagnosed dilution factor , but would have negligible effect on the modeled spectrum .",
    "2 presents a diagram of the dominant photo - excitation channels for two [ 2 ] lines arising from quartets and doublets terms .",
    "the main photoexcitation channels are indicated by dashed lines and the radiative deexcitation transitions are marked by solid lines .",
    "such dipole allowed radiative decays lead to emission lines , observable in the spectra , just as they populate the levels that give rise to forbidden lines .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the absence of collisional excitation , the strength of forbidden lines would be tightly bound to the intensity of the dipole transitions from the pumping mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , the contribution of collisional excitations to the forbidden lines introduces a complex temperature and density dependence in the relative strengths of dipole and forbidden transitions , which can be used for spectral diagnostics as illustrated in the next section .    fig .",

    "this is because collisional transition rates from the ground levels to the @xmath73 multiplet are rather small .",
    "we use the [ 2 ] and [ 2 ] emission line strengths to diagnose the physical conditions of the filament on each of the three hst / stis observations : march  2000 , april  2001 , and november  2001 ( hereafter mar00 , apr01 , nov01 respectively ; bautista et al.2002 ; hartman et al.2004 ) .",

    ", we use the deep spectra extending from 1640   to 10100   analyzed by hartman et al .",
    "the original data was recorded during three visits with the hubble space telescope / space telescope imaging spectrograph ( hst / stis ) under several different observational programs . for the mar00 observation the long 52``x0.2 '' aperture",
    "was aligned close to the axis of the homunculus ( position angle -41deg ) , whereas the aperture was aligned at 22  deg in apr01 and -130  deg in nov01 .",
    "the different angles were defined primarily by hst sun - angle restrictions , but were used to study the extent of the strontium filament in different directions .",
    "the intersection of these apertures ( see fig .  1 in hartman et al.2004 ) is on the apparent peak of the strontium filament as first noticed by the discovery observations ( zethson et al.2001 ) .",
    "the line fluxes were integrated across the line profiles of the components centered at @xmath75 - 100 km / s at specific positions along the slit .",
    "the intersection position of the different visits is the primary position of interest .",
    "however as noted below , several additional positions were sampled along the aperture oriented radially to ( p.a.=-41@xmath76 ) and tangentially ( -130@xmath76 ) to understand the spatial variation of specific line ratios and therein , to study the excitation and ionization structure of the filament .",
    "the measured line intensities vary along the aperture and between visits .",
    "the structure is complex as other nebular structures are in line of sight : namely the homunculus and the little homunculus . at some positions , hartman et al.(2004 )",
    "noted a second velocity structure in many lines .",
    "these two velocity systems are likely related to the two disks noted by davidson et al.(2001 ) located between the bipolar lobes .",
    "the two velocity components correspond to material in the same equatorial disk but with two different ages , as noted by davidson et al .",
    "the more prominent feature is associated with the parts of the skirt ejected along with the homunculus in the 1840 s .",
    "the fainter and more blueshifted feature is also in the equator , but was ejected in the 1890 outburst along with the little homunculus ( ishibashi et al .",
    "2003 ; smith 2005 ) and the weigelt knots ( smith et al . 2004 ; weigelt et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this study",
    "we focus on the structure ejected in the 1840s .    as with any spectroscopic analysis",
    "the observed line intensities must be corrected for extinction .",
    "none of the lines that form the classical line ratios ( e.g. hydrogen recombination lines ) are detected .",
    "we use two relatively well known [ 2 ] transitions that arise from a common upper level , i.e. @xmath77@xmath78 ) and @xmath79@xmath80 ) , and the standard interstellar extinction curve of cardelli et al.(1989 ) . while these lines are relatively close in wavelength , thus far they are the best candidates for estimating extinction as all other lines of interest are much weaker or their predicted line ratios are less certain .",
    "the observed line ratios are @xmath81 in mar00 , @xmath82 in apr01 , and @xmath83 in nov01 .",
    "thus , there are no significant variations of the line ratio between the three observations . from these observations",
    "we derive an extinction magnitude , @xmath84 , as required to correct the ratios to the theoretical value of 1.6 , with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath7510% .",
    "the relatively large uncertainty in @xmath85 comes from the fact that the two lines used in the diagnostic are close in wavelength .",
    "this value for the extinction magnitude is consistent with the value measured , @xmath86 , from photometry of stars of the tr  16 cluster in the carinae nebula ( tapia et al.2003 ) .",
    "the actual extinction magnitude to the filament could be somewhat higher than to the carinae stars due to the dust within the nebula .",
    "smith ( 2002b ) studied local extinction within the larger carina nebula , and found a total - to - selective extinction of r=@xmath87 , which is different than the normal ism value of 3.1 .",
    "furthermore , the extinction around itself is likely to be very gray because of the large grain size ( smith et al .",
    "however , thermal - ir maps of the dust column density in the homunculus reveal a local minimum near the position of the sr filament ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ) , so the unusual reddening there may not be a severe problem .",
    "we thus adopt for the remaining of this paper a extinction law with @xmath88 and the interstellar @xmath89 .",
    "clearly , the remaining uncertainty on this value can be important in trying to compare lines well separated in wavelength , thus all diagnostics should be carried out with lines close to each other .",
    "tables  5 and 6 present the complete lists of [ 2 ] and [ 2 ] lines used for the present study and their intensities corrected for extinction .",

    "the dilution factor from the nov01 observation lies between the values for the other two observations .",
    "the spread in line ratios , and consequently on derived physical conditions , in the three observations are the result of different orientations of the spectrograph slit with respect to the star ( see hartman et al .",
    "for the mar00 observations the slit was centered on with the fiducial , f2 , blocking the starlight .",
    "this provided a spatial sampling of the sr - emitting region extending radially from the central source . that this spectrum yields the highest value for the dilution factor is due to finding the radial distance for which both apply .",

    "as the position of the slit is more distant than the optimal position for highest dilution factor , we get a lower value for the dilution factor along this slit .",

    "the observed line ratios from the nov01 spectrum are also indicated .",
    "inspection of these plot reveals that the best agreement for all the lines observed is obtained for @xmath143  k.    this relatively low temperature is consistent with the observed ionization structure of fe and ni in the filament .",
    "the observed iron emission arises mostly from neutral iron , indicating that this dominates over 2 .",
    "because of the iron shielding of the filament it is expected that there would be few photons capable of ionizing fe  i. but , even in the absence of photoionization collisional ionization drives most of the iron into 2 whenever electron temperatures exceed @xmath144  k ( see arnaud and raymond 1992 ) . below this temperature neutral iron",
    "may be the dominant ionization stage .",
    "on the other hand , under collisional ionization conditions the fraction of ionized to neutral nickel is more than twice the fraction for iron at the same temperature .",
    "thus , 2 is expected to remain the dominant ionization stage for temperatures as low as @xmath145  k.    finally , we can determine the electron density .",
    "8 depicts four line ratios as function of the electron density for a fixed @xmath133=-9.0 and temperatures of @xmath146  k. the electron density is readily diagnosed at around @xmath0  3 .",

    "this comparison for the nov01 spectrum is shown in table  7 .",
    "the agreement is reasonably good considering the remaining uncertainties in the atomic data and the shape of the pumping radiation continuum .",
    "the 2 @xmath147)/i([\\lambda 4918])$ ] ratio is large across most of the spectral slit , which allows us to further investigate the spatial variations of the dilution factor near the sr - filament . to do this we integrated the intensity over 0.13 `` wide regions of the spectrum from mar00 and nov01 .",
    "the measured line ratios , corrected for extinction , and the derived dilution factors from them are shown in fig .",
    "the mar00 observations , when the f2 fiducial ( 0.85 '' long ) was centered on with the large aperture extending radially from the star at the middle of the filament ( 1.3 \" from ) , clearly show a linear decay of the dilution factor with distance from the central source . consistently with this picture , the nov01 slit that was centered on the sr - filament and perpendicular to the radial direction from the central source , shows a maximum of the dilution factor at the middle of the filament and symmetric drop offs toward both sides of this position .",

    "once the physical conditions of the sr - filament have been determined we proceed to compute the relative abundances of 2 and 2 .",
    "we use the nov01 spectrum because : ( 1 ) much more spectral interval was covered during that visit and the greatly increased number of lines , which permits a better statistical determination , and ( 2 ) the long aperture likely sampled similar regions for the 2 and 2 due to the tangential slit orientation .",
    "nonetheless , we have confirmed that the computed relative abundances from all other observations also agree , within the uncertainties .",
    "10 depicts the @xmath149 as derived from the [ 2 ] @xmath150 and [ 2 ] @xmath151 lines .",
    "the calculated abundance ratio is plotted against the assumed value for the dilution factor and for temperatures of @xmath146  k as diagnosed from the spectrum .",
    "given the fact that the lines observed from both species have similar excitation energies and arise from levels with the same multiplicity and parity , they respond similarly to changes in the dilution factor .",
    "so we see that the uncertainty in the abundance ratio is negligible for the mean temperature of 6000  k , and uncertainty in the derived abundance does not exceed 20% within the whole range of dilution parameters and temperatures .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath152 , with a conservative uncertainty that may not exceed a factor of three , including the dispersion from all the lines which contains non - systematic uncertainties in the atomic data and the treatment of the pumping continuum field .    to estimate the total @xmath153 abundance ratio we notice that only neutral and singly ionized ions are present in the spectra .",
    "it is expected that the ionic ratios ti  i / ti",
    "ii and ni  i / ni  ii are similar since ti  i and ni  i have approximately the same ionization potential . moreover , from observations one can conclude that ni and ti are both singly ionized , as there are no lines from the neutral stages of these ions in the spectra . thus , @xmath154 in gas phase .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the best solar abundance ratio of @xmath750.05 .",
    "in other words , the gas phase @xmath153 abundance ratio in the sr - filament is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than solar value .",
    "further , we have checked on the @xmath155 abundance ratio in the filament .",
    "this calculation is complicated by the fact that the [ 2 ] emission comes from a more extended region in velocity space .",
    "thus , we only consider the integrated flux of [ 2 ] lines within the range in velocity space that coincides the [ 2 ] emission we find a value for the @xmath155 ratio roughly consistent with the solar @xmath156 ratio , assuming that the ionic fractions of 2 and 2 are tied to each other by charge exchange and are thus within a factor of two of each other",
    ". it must be noted , however , that the filament exhibits prominent emission from fe  i , suggesting a large abundance of this ion , but no emission from ni  i or ti  i within the sensitivity of the observations .",
    "= 9 cm    = 8 cm    the observed large overabundance of titanium with respect to both nickel and iron in the gas phase is quite striking .",
    "ti / fe abundance ratios higher than solar by up to 0.4 dex are known to occur in metal - poor and extremely metal - poor stars ( ryan et al . 1996 ) , but to the best of our knowledge there are no reports of such a high overabundance as we have analyzed here .",
    "it is likely that the abnormal relative abundances found here are only representative of the gas phase , rather than the total absolute abundances . under the conditions of the sr - filament nearly 90% of fe and ni",
    "are condensed into grains .",
    "thus , a large ti / ni gas phase abundance ratio would be attained if some kind of destruction mechanism of ti - bearing condensates acted in the filament .",
    "although we do not have a clear explanation for such a mechanism we devote this section of the paper to study the chemistry of the ti , ni , and fe under the conditions of the sr - filament .",
    "condensation temperatures of ti , fe , and ni are somewhat different and ti is generally more refractory than fe and ni during condensation from a solar composition gas ( e.g. , lodders 2003 ) .",
    "as described below , ti also forms a more refractory condensate than fe and ni from the overall composition relevant for the ejecta here .",
    "condensation temperatures depend on bulk composition and total pressure . in a solar composition gas with c / o = 0.5",
    ", titanium condenses as calcium titanate ( e.g. , perovskite , catio@xmath157 ) , followed by an iron and nickel metal alloy at somewhat lower temperatures ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "trace elements such as sr condense into solid solution with major element host phases , and condensation of sr as `` srtio@xmath157 '' into catio@xmath157 proceeds at temperatures between that of catio@xmath157 and metal alloy formation .",
    "as long as the overall composition of s ejecta remained near - solar , solar - type condensates should also have formed . however , in the sr - filament and in the rest of the emission ejecta within the homunculus , the little homunculus and the weigelt blobs , very little oxygen has ever been detected . moreover , in the weigelt blobs where [ o  i ] @xmath158 emission is seen , oxygen seems to be underabundant by at least two orders of magnitude ( e.g. thackeray 1967 , zethson 2001 , verner et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the outer ejecta carbon and oxygen",
    "are severely depleted relative to solar abundances ( davidson et al .",
    "1982 ; dufour et al 1997 ; smith and morse 2004 ) .",
    "hydrogen is also depleted whereas n and he are enriched . in order to explore the condensation chemistry , we adopt a solar composition gas in which solar c and o abundances are both reduced by a factor of 100 . the n abundance is increased by the amount removed from the solar c and o abundances so that the sum of solar cno nuclei is preserved .",
    "the he abundance is taken as solar plus a quarter of the solar h abundance , and the h abundance is set to zero .",
    "note that the chemistry of ti , fe , ni , and si is relatively insensitive to the total h abundance because there are no major h - bearing gases for those elements .",
    "even if h were fairly abundant , the following condensation results would change little .",
    "descriptions of the thermochemical computation methods are given in lodders ( 2003 ) and lodders & fegley ( 1997 ) .",
    "the results of this calculation serve as a good illustration of the dust chemistry , and should remain qualitatively correct despite variations of the precise relative abundances .",
    "the condensates ( fig .",
    "11 ) for this `` cno '' processed composition are first tic , and at about 100  k lower temperature , an iron - nickel silicide alloy , ( fe , ni)si . below total pressures of @xmath159 bar , sic condensation temperatures are within a few degrees of those of the silicide alloy .",
    "the condensates from the `` cno '' processed composition are the same as appear when c and o abundances of an otherwise solar composition gas are only slightly ( i.e. orders of factor 2 ) modified so that c / o @xmath160 1 ( lodders & fegley 1995 , 1999 ) . here",
    "the c / o ratio remains solar but the large decrease in absolute c and o abundances is responsible for the appearance of the carbides and silicide because there is no oxygen for sio and silicate or oxide formation .",
    "the elemental composition here has enough c for condensation of all ti as tic ( the total ti / c is @xmath75 0.03 ) but only a little sic can form because si is more abundant than c ( si / c @xmath75 14 ) and si condenses also into ( fe , ni)si .",
    "the overall c abundance is so low that graphite does not condense at the relatively high temperatures where tic and ( fe , ni)si form .",
    "if carbon were completely absent here , titanium nitride ( tin , osbornite ) would condense instead of tic at about the same temperature , sic would be completely absent , and condensation of ( fe , ni)si would remain unchanged .",
    "condensation temperatures describe when a compound starts to form ( i.e. , where the saturation ratio reaches unity ) but lower temperatures are needed to fully remove an element from the gas into a condensate , as shown for a constant total pressure in fig",
    "complete titanium removal from the gas requires a drop of about 100  k below the condensation temperature of tic and all ti is condensed at temperatures when ( fe , ni)si condensation begins to proceed .    given the nature of the ti- , ni- , and fe - bearings described here we suggest that selective photoevaporation of ti - bearings is a possible explanation for the gas phase ti / ni abundance found in the filament .",
    "two different scenarios may be suggested : ( 1 ) there was some spatial separation between the tic and(ni , fe)si condensates , related to their different condensation temperatures , that left the tic rich gas more exposed to photoevaporation ; ( 2 ) the tic grains are generally smaller than the ( ni , fe)si grains , and so the tic condensates were much less resistant to photoevaporation .",
    "these scenarios sketched out here seem promising to explain the observations and need to be studied in more detail .",
    "further , it is important to determine the abundance ratios of other elements of different volatility .",
    "we have studied the 2 and 2 spectra of the sr - filament in , as taken in three different epochs with the hst . in doing this",
    "we build spectral models for the two ions using the best published data for 2 , while we carry out extensive calculations of radiative and electron impact rates for 2 .",
    "the spectral models were employed for diagnosing the physical conditions of the emitting region .",
    "the results are generally consistent with previous determinations using [ 2 ] and 2 lines .",
    "moreover , the [ 2 ] lines allow us to constrain the conditions for observations with the aperture across the s central source to @xmath161 3 , @xmath162  k , and dilution factor @xmath163 for an assumed blackbody continuum radiation with temperature of 35  000  k. for observations with the slit perpendicular to the radial direction the dilution factor seems to be somewhat lower .",
    "study of the observed [ 2 ] emission reveals a very large overabundance of ti in gas phase with respect to ni and fe relative to the cosmic values .",
    "we study the chemistry of ti , ni , and fe in cno - cycled gas and find that ti condenses as tic , or alternatively as tin , while ni and fe are locked into ( ni , fe)si . moreover , the tic condenses at higher temperatures than ni- and fe - bearings .",
    "later , we suggest that the tic would be selectively destroyed by the stellar uv radiation leading to a relative overabundance of ti in gas phase .",
    "this explanation for the unusual ti / ni ratios in the sr - filament requires that significant dust and molecules had formed in this material shortly after the great eruption , but have since been largely photoevporated here . in this context",
    ", it is very interesting that near - ir emission from molecular hydrogen is seen throughout the polar lobes of the homunculus nebula ( smith 2002a ) , but this same h@xmath5 emission is not seen at comparable levels from the equatorial skirt in the vicinity of the sr - filament ( smith 2002a , 2004 ) .",
    "today , the gas densities we infer in the sr filament ( @xmath7510@xmath164 @xmath1 ) are very high compared to many other circumstellar nebulae around massive stars , and are similar to the extremely high densities seen in the walls of the homunculus ( e.g. , gull et al . 2005",
    "; nielsen et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a weaker radiation field at larger radii is not the only explanation for this difference : h@xmath5 emission is seen both in the polar caps of the homunculus at larger radii from the star than the sr - filament , and in the side walls of the polar lobes near the equator , even _ closer _ to the star than the sr filament ( smith 2004 ) . in the past when the sr - filament ejecta were even denser , it is conceivable that h@xmath5 or other molecules may have existed , but have since been destroyed . if true , this would seem to support the scenario of unusual chemistry resulting from selective photoevaporation and cno processed ejecta , as we have suggested here .",
