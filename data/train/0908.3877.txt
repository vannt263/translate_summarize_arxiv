    "statistical mechanics has been very successful in making predictions about the behavior of macroscopic systems we encounter in nature , yet there are still open questions concerning a fully quantum formulation of statistical mechanics . for instance",
    ", how can we explain the use of statistical ensembles in the description of a physical system which is supposed to be in a definite state ?",
    "in this context the independent re - discovery by several groups of the importance of _ typicality _ @xcite has given rise to interesting directions of research @xcite .",
    "although the concept originally appeared as an incomplete formulation in a work by schrodinger @xcite , lebowitz was the one to coin the term typicality and , together with others , did some pioneering work on the subject @xcite .",
    "typicality can be seen as a key feature justifying the effectiveness of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics , without requiring ergodicity or mixing .",
    "the works on typicality in the quantum setting have shown that ensemble averages and subjective ignorance may not be necessary concepts for the understanding of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "intuitively , typicality refers to the fact that the vast majority of pure microstates of a quantum system , belonging to a well - defined region of the allowed state space , yield measurement outcomes very close to each other .",
    "more quantitatively , typicality can be associated with a very small variance of the measurement outcomes with respect to a specified ensemble of states .",
    "previous works @xcite have focused on the study of typicality for _ general _ quantum states , providing a first alternative approach to the foundational problems of quantum statistical mechanics",
    ". however it is well know that the generation of haar distributed random states is hard even at the quantum level @xcite . therefore in order to consider typicality an effective scheme for the justification of statistical mechanics one should restrict to realizable random states , possibly with some specific physical content .",
    "first we need to choose and characterize this set of states , though of course the choice is not unique . in the present work we focus on matrix product states ( mps ) ( see @xcite for a review and original references ) as instances of physically accessible states .",
    "the reason why we restrict the study of typicality to mps is because these are a good example of physically relevant states , arising as ground states of local hamiltonians and being at the basis of some of the most recent and promising classical algorithms for the simulation of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "both of these properties justify a better understanding of their statistical properties with respect to typicality , which eventually can also lead to new powerful simulation techniques ( as the work in @xcite may suggest ) .",
    "we shall prove that typicality can emerge in the mps set , and then illustrate this result with some numerical simulations .",
    "a matrix product state is a pure one - dimensional quantum state whose coefficients are specified by a product of matrices . in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc )",
    "an mps can be written as @xmath0\\cdots a^{i_{n}}[n]\\right]|i_{1}\\cdots i_{n}\\rangle,\\ ] ] whereas for open boundary conditions ( obc ) we have @xmath1\\cdots a^{i_{n}}[n]|\\phi_{f}\\rangle|i_{1}\\cdots i_{n}\\rangle,\\ ] ] with @xmath2 and @xmath3 specifying the states at the boundaries and @xmath4 a local basis at site @xmath5 .",
    "the matrices @xmath6,a^{2}[s],\\dots , a^{d}[s]\\}$ ] , with @xmath7 , are @xmath8-dimensional complex matrices , with @xmath9 the local hilbert space dimension . for homogeneous mps the set @xmath6,a^{2}[s],\\dots , a^{d}[s]\\}$ ]",
    "is the same for all sites @xmath10 . in the case of pbc",
    "they are referred to as translationally ivariant ( ti ) mps . in the present work , for simplicity of notation and analysis",
    ", we deal numerically with obc - mps and analytically with pbc - ti - mps .",
    "we checked numerically that all of our conclusions hold true independently of the boundary conditions and invariance under translations .    by definition ,",
    "a mps is specified by the set @xmath11 , though there may exist a different set of matrices that form the same mps .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that this sort of gauge degree of freedom can be fixed using a canonical form where the @xmath12 matrices satisfy two constraints : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for fixed @xmath15 ( an alternative set of constraints is given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "mps can also be seen as generalized valence - bond states @xcite , and as such , emerging from the projection on some virtual or ancillary hilbert space .",
    "the fundamental parameter of an mps is the size @xmath8 of the @xmath12-matrices . in general ,",
    "an mps contains @xmath18 parameters , much less than the usual @xmath19 of a general state , and as a consequence the maximum entanglement a subsystem can have with its environment depends on @xmath8 .",
    "it can be shown that any state can be described as an mps for large enough @xmath8 with at most @xmath20 ( though there is no advantage in such a description ) @xcite . for more details and properties of mps used in this work",
    "see appendix b.    for our purposes we need to generate an ensemble of random mps ( rmps ) and the way to do this is by no means unique .",
    "one could think , for example , of choosing a set of matrices @xmath21 belonging to some relevant ensemble known in random matrix theory .",
    "this choice would induce additional symmetries on the @xmath12-matrices that will constrain the set of rmps too much , and for which the physical meaning would not be clear a priori ( see @xcite for a related construction in a different context ) .",
    "the ensemble of rmps that we consider in this work is constructed by the repeated random unitary interaction between an ancilla and a physical system , as described in the framework of the sequential generation of mps @xcite .",
    "this is an operationally and physically motivated realization of mps .",
    "we now briefly summarize the construction in @xcite . consider a spin chain initially in a product state @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) and an ancillary system in the state @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 $ ] be a unitary operation on @xmath26 , acting on the ancillary system and the @xmath5th site of the chain ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath27 $ ] matrices are defined by @xmath28\\equiv\\langle i,\\alpha|u[k]|\\beta,0\\rangle,\\label{eq : amat}\\ ] ] where the greek indeces refer to the ancilla space and the latin indeces to the physical space . for homogeneous mps the unitary interaction is the same for all the sites in the spin chain . due to unitarity",
    "we have @xmath29^{\\dagger}a^{i}[k]=\\mathbb{i}_{\\chi}$ ] for all @xmath5 in the bulk .",
    "this property , together with a proper normalization of the boundaries , corresponds to an mps of unit - norm ( see appendix b for more details ) .",
    "letting the ancilla interact sequentially with the @xmath30 sites of the chain and assuming that the ancilla decouples in the last step ( this can be done without loss of generality , as shown in @xcite ) , the state on @xmath31 is described by @xmath32 which is a homogeneous mps with obc .",
    "it can be proved @xcite that the set of states generated in this way is equal to the set of obc - mps .",
    "we choose the interaction characterizing the homogeneous rmps ensemble to be represented by a random unitary matrix @xmath33 distributed according to the haar measure .     with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the boundary normalized states . ]",
    "since any state can be described by an mps when @xmath20 @xcite , typicality should appear trivially for mps with this exponential scaling of @xmath8 in @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the relevant question is if it is possible to have typicality when the rank increases at most polynomially with the number of particles : @xmath36",
    ". this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "typicality can be studied at a more formal level in the framework of concentration of measure , a mathematical tool which allows to establish typicality in large - dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "the concentration of measure phenomenon allows to quantify the probability of fluctuations for functions of random variables , and in the physical literature has already been applied in a variety of contexts @xcite . we shall use a result on the concentration of measure phenomenon for the unitary group in order to prove typicality for subsystems observables ( a more rigorous mathematical introduction to the topic can be found in @xcite",
    "; in particular , here we use theorem 6.7.1 of that book ) .",
    "concentration of measure holds for the unitary group and this means that there exist universal positive constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that for any function @xmath39 from the set of haar - distributed unitary matrices of size @xmath40 into @xmath41 , and with lipschitz constant @xmath42 @xmath43\\leq c_{1}\\exp\\left(-c_{2}\\epsilon^{2}d/\\eta^{2}\\right),\\label{eq : prob}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the average value of @xmath45 . from this expression",
    "one can see that typicality is valid only for functions @xmath45 for which the ratio @xmath46 ( where @xmath42 can in principle also depend on @xmath47 ) increases with the dimension @xmath47 of the domain , since in this case the probability of large fluctuations around their average will decrease exponentially in @xmath47 .    in the present work",
    "the random variable @xmath45 will be the expectation value of an observable with respect to a random mps .",

    "the recent new approach to typicality comes in two main flavors , one due to popescu et .",

    "the first approach is more mathematical in two aspects : it uses results from the concentration of measure phenomenon and considers distances between states of subsystems .",

    "the @xmath88components vectors are defined by @xmath89 @xmath90 and the same for @xmath91 the operator @xmath92 acts on the @xmath88tensor product of the ancilla system and cyclicly permutes the components @xmath93 the unitary random matrix @xmath94 is the one used in the sequential generation of the random mps .",
    "a closed form for the average of the tensor product of unitaries @xmath95 is known @xcite . in fig.[fig : fig2 ] we plot the trace distance between the average random mps with obc and the completely mixed state ( for a chain of @xmath96 qubits ) @xmath97 , as a function of the size of the sampling set ( the number of randomly generated states ) . in the same figure",
    "we also plot the same quantity in the case of random general pure state ( not necessarily mps ) . as can be seen from the figure",
    "the average obc - rmps is at a finite distance from the mixed state , while the average general state approaches the mixed state increasing the number of sampled states .",
    "another distinctive feature of the homogeneous obc - rmps is shown in fig.[fig : fig3 ] , where we plot the empirical probability distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of 1 qubit in a 4-sites rmps . in fig.[fig : fig4 ] we show the same plot for general randomly generated states .",
    "as can be seen the two distribution differs significantly . from now on , unless otherwise stated , for all simulations we consider an ensemble of @xmath98 rmps which originate from random unitaries distributed according to the haar measure .",
    "we now want to illustrate our analytical results studying the behavior of the variance of @xmath99 , which acts on a particle ( @xmath100 ) in the middle of the chain .",
    "note that the important variable is not the absolute size of the subsystem or the bath but the ratio between them . as can be seen in fig.[fig : fig5].a , when we fix the value of @xmath8 and increase the number of qubits in the bath the variance starts to decrease , but soon reaches a limiting value and does not decrease any more .",
    "the limiting value depends on @xmath8 , becoming smaller as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "this could be expected from our bound and from a known property of mps : correlations between system and environment are of finite range and depend on @xmath8 .",
    "this is also consisten with recent result on finite entanglement scaling at criticality @xcite .",
    "note , however , that our analytical result does not exclude the possibility of having typicality for fixed @xmath8 or @xmath8 scaling linearly with @xmath30 .",
    "it only guarantees typicality in the case of a scaling greater than quadratic .",
    "we then analyze the case where @xmath101 , as show in fig.[fig : fig5].b .",
    "there it can be seen that until @xmath102 the variance is decreasing monotonically , which indicates that typicality can emerge already for a linear scaling of @xmath8 with the number of particles .",

    "we also investigate the behavior of the average trace distance from the average state at the level of the sub - system , which is one particle in our case . denoting with @xmath105",
    "the reduced density matrix of the subsystem of a rmps and @xmath106 the average mps , fig.([fig : fig6].a ) shows the dependence on the size of the bath of the average value @xmath107 of the trace distance @xmath108 . in general",
    ", we expect that having typicality at the level of states is harder than at the level of observables ( see appendix c ) .",
    "again we look at the case of fixed @xmath8 ( fig.([fig : fig6].a ) ) and @xmath101 ( fig.([fig : fig6].b ) ) .",
    "the conclusions are similar to the case of observables , and it appears that even at the level of states typicality may occur already for a linear scaling of @xmath8 in the size of the bath , while the behavior for different but fixed values of @xmath8 is again consistent with well - known mps properties .",
    "in summary , we have shown that typicality can arise not only for an exponentially big hilbert space but also for a physically accessible smaller set of states : the matrix product states .",
    "more specifically , we showed analytically that typicality occurs for mpss having @xmath8 scaling polynomially in the size of the system ( with a power greater than 2 ) .",
    "we then presented some numerical calculations which indicate that typicality may already emerge for a linear scaling of @xmath8 in the system size at the level of both observables and the states .",
    "our results provide further evidence that typicality may play a role in a better understanding of the foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "nonetheless , there are still some aspects that require a deeper analysis . for example",
    ", it would be interesting to have more information on the average state obtained from the present ensemble of rmps ( in general @xmath109 will still be a matrix product state but with a bigger rank than its components ) and to better characterize the role of the geometry of the partition in between subsystem and bath and their correlations .",

    "if @xmath181 is a random state and @xmath182 is its average , one can see that a bound on the fluctuations of the right hand side of the above inequality implies a bound on the fluctuations of the left hand side .",
    "in general one can say that close states will have close expectation values for any observable of finite operator norm .",
    "but in general the converse is not true : if the expectation value of some observable with respect to different states is close this does not imply that the states are close . a way to estimate the state - distance",
    "is shown in @xcite .",
    "we prove in this manuscript that for the expectation value @xmath45 of any local observable , restricted to a subsystem of size @xmath56 much smaller than the size @xmath30 of the total system , the following holds true @xmath183<c_{1}exp(-c_{2}^{\\prime}\\epsilon^{2}\\chi",
