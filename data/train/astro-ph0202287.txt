    "low - mass stars in the pre - main sequence ( pms ) stage are classified into four types based on their infrared ( ir ) to sub - mm spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ; molecular cloud cores through protostars are represented by class 0 and i seds , while classical and weak - line t - tauri stars ( cttss and wttss ) exhibit class ii and iii seds @xcite .    the _ einstein _ satellite first revealed that t - tauri stars ( ttss = cttss and wttss ) emit intense and time variable x - rays with occasional rapid flares @xcite .",
    "these properties are consistent with a scenario of enhanced solar - type activity , attributable to magnetic dynamo processes .",
    "successive x - ray satellites such as _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , and _",
    "chandra _ have detected x - ray emission from many pms stars , even from the youngest class 0 stage @xcite , and suggest that x - ray emission from low - mass pms stars is caused by magnetic activity .",
    "these results , however , rely mainly on short duration observations ; neither long - term nor detailed behavior of the x - ray spectrum and timing has been well studied .",
    "this paper hence addresses three topics on ttss ; ( 1 ) the duty ratio of the x - ray flare , ( 2 ) the long - term plasma structure and variability , and ( 3 ) the chemical compositions in the quiescent and flare phases .",
    "\\(1 ) @xcite compiled _ rosat _ pspc observations of the taurus - auriga - perseus region and found that the flare rate may depend on the stellar age , rotation period , and/or multiplicity ; stars with younger ages , shorter rotation periods , and located in binary systems tend to show more frequent flares .",
    "hence , the flare rate may help to reveal the physical conditions of pms stars .",
    "\\(2 ) @xcite fitted the _",
    "_ pspc spectra of @xmath160 pms stars with several thermal plasma models and found that multi - temperature components are needed for most of the spectra .",
    "@xcite also reported that about two - thirds of the _ chandra _ spectra of ttss in the orion molecular cloud tend to be well fitted by multi - temperature plasma models as compared with single temperature plasma models for younger objects ( protostars ) .",
    "the multi - temperature structure may also depend on the activity phase of each star ; higher temperature plasma becomes dominant in a flare compared with a quiescent phase .",
    "thus long - term monitoring of both flare and quiescent phases is crucial for the study of the origin and structure of the multi - temperature plasma .",
    "\\(3 ) _ asca _ found that the mean chemical composition of x - ray - emitting plasma in young stellar objects ( ysos ) is generally sub - solar and varies from star to star @xcite .",
    "these results may be misleading , however , because the mean - abundance determination is biased toward elements with strong emission lines in the relevant energy range and largely depends on the plasma temperature .",
    "moreover , the abundances of the stellar corona may be different from those in the photosphere , depending on the first ionization potential ( fip ) of the relevant elements .",
    "for instance , in a solar corona , elements with low fip are overabundant relative to the solar photospheric values ( `` the fip effect '' , feldman 1992 ) . in some of the stellar coronae , however , the abundances of high - fip elements are larger than the others ( the inverse fip = ifip effect )",
    ". the ifip effect appears in x - ray active stars , while the fip effect is generally seen in less active stars @xcite .",
    "the dependence of abundance on the x - ray activity is also found within individual stars ; the enhancements in abundance are seen from quiescent to flare phases , or even within a single flare phase ( e.g. hr1099 , audard et al .",
    "2001 ; v773 tau , tsuboi et al .",
    "1998 ) . due to the limited statistics and samples , however , it is unclear whether or not abundance variations between quiescent and flare phases are common , and whether or not fip / ifip effects are present in low - mass ysos .    to investigate the above - mentioned subjects , we selected the three x - ray brightest ttss ; doar 21 ( roxs 8) , roxs 21 and roxs 31 in the @xmath0 ophiuchi cloud ( @xmath0 oph ) located at a distance of 145 pc @xcite , because all three have publicly available long - term observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ asca_. these ttss were first recognized as bright x - ray sources with _",
    "@xcite , and were identified with optical k ",
    "m stars having weak h@xmath6 emission @xcite , hence classified as wtts ( class iii ) .",
    "@xcite observed the lunar occultation of these wttss at infrared wavelengths and found that roxs 21 and roxs 31 are binary systems with separation angles of 03 and 048 , respectively .",
    "the rotational period of roxs 21 is reported to be 1.39 days @xcite . since no continuum emission is found at 1.3 mm @xcite , the circumstellar envelope of these ttss is thought to have already disappeared , while doar 21 may still have an accretion disk , as suggested by the detection of near - infrared ( nir ) polarized emission @xcite . using the theoretical evolutionary tracks in the h - r diagram , the age of doar 21 is estimated to be @xmath110@xmath2 yr , which is younger than that of roxs 21 and roxs 31 ( @xmath110@xmath3 yr ) @xcite .",
    "finally , doar 21 and roxs 31 show variable radio emission , which is probably due to the gyro - synchrotron emission induced by the surface magnetic field @xcite .",
    "early results with the _ chandra _ and _ asca _ observations @xcite revealed that these particular ttss have luminosities of @xmath710@xmath8 ergs s@xmath5 and relatively low absorption ( @xmath9 @xmath10 10@xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus they can provide enough counts to measure their temporal and spectral properties in great detail .",
    "the _ chandra _ @xcite observation ( hereafter , obs c1 ) of these ttss was made with five front - illuminated x - ray ccds , acis - i0 , i1 , i2 , i3 , and s2 , in the 0.210 kev band .",
    "the level 2 data were retrieved from the _ chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) archive .",
    "x - ray events are selected using the _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "an effective exposure time of @xmath13100 ks is obtained ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "another long exposure observation of the @xmath0 oph core a , which contains doar 21 in the acis - i3 , is also in the archive ( obs c2 ) , but this data suffer from the photon pile - up and therefore were not used .",
    "three observations ( obs a1 , a2 , and a3 ) were carried out with the two gas imaging spectrometers ( giss ) @xcite and the two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( siss ) @xcite onboard _ asca _",
    "@xcite , at the foci of the x - ray telescopes ( xrts ) @xcite sensitive to photons in 0.410 kev .",
    "however , the tts sources were located outside of , or at the edge of the sis s field of view in the majority of the observations ; therefore we do not use the sis data .",
    "we retrieved the _",
    "unscreened data from the heasarc online service .",
    "data taken at a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity lower than 4 gv , at an elevation angle less than 5@xmath14 from the earth , and during passage through the south atlantic anomaly were filtered out .",
    "particle events were also removed using the rise - time discrimination method .",
    "the total available exposure times were @xmath1338 ks ( obs a1 ) , 93 ks ( a2 ) , and 75 ks ( a3 ) ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the positions of nir counterparts @xcite were used to fine - tune the _ chandra _ coordinates .",
    "we then extracted the source photons using an ellipse with major and minor axes of 600 and 350 , respectively , for doar 21 , and from respective circles of 117 and 120 radius for roxs 21 and roxs31 , with the regions centered at the nir positions @xcite .",
    "the relatively large source areas are due to large off - axis point spread functions ( psfs ) ; doar 21 lies in acis - s2 @xmath120@xmath15 away from the optical axis , while roxs 21 and roxs 31 are at the edge of acis - i1 with off - axis angles of @xmath1710@xmath15 .",
    "the large off - axis angle ( and hence large psf ) for the brightest source doar21 mitigates photon pile - up , which in fact is a problem for the obs c2 case .",
    "the background region for doar 21 was taken from a source - free 19 arcmin@xmath16 region on acis - s2 , while that for roxs 21 and roxs 31 was taken from a 63 arcmin@xmath16 region on the acis - i array .",
    "for the asca gis data ( obs a1a3 ) the source photons were extracted from 3@xmath15 radii circles .",
    "the background regions were also taken using 3@xmath15 radii circles from nearby source - free regions .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_c1 ] and [ fig : lc_a1 - 3 ] show the x - ray light curves ( no background subtraction ) of ( a ) doar 21 , ( b ) roxs 21 , and ( c ) roxs 31 obtained with the _ chandra _ acis ( obs c1 ) and the _ asca _ gis ( obs a1a3 ) , respectively .",
    "the photon counts are normalized by the effective area at 1 kev , for comparison with the different instruments and observation epochs .",
    "the time bins of each data point are 10@xmath17 s and 10@xmath18 s for acis ( figure [ fig : lc_c1 ] ) and gis ( figure [ fig : lc_a1 - 3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the energy band of the acis and gis data for doar 21 are taken to be 0.59.0 kev . however , the gis light curves for roxs 21 and roxs 31 are limited in the soft energy band of 0.51.5 kev in order to avoid possible contamination from a nearby variable hard x - ray source , ylw 15a @xcite . to verify the energy band , we extracted the acis - i spectrum of ylw 15a and fit it with an absorbed thin thermal plasma model .",
    "we find a best - fitted absorption of @xmath9 = 4.4@xmath1910@xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite , which reduces the x - ray emission below 1.5 kev to less than 3% of the 1.59 kev flux .",
    "hence possible contamination from ylw 15 a to the gis source circles of roxs 21 and roxs 31 is insignificant in the 0.51.5 kev band .",
    "no data is shown in the roxs 21 light curve ( figure [ fig : lc_a1 - 3]b ) from mjd = 50511.5550512.20 due to significant contamination from an exceptionally giant flare of roxs 31 ( see figure [ fig : lc_a1 - 3]c ) .    for a unified study ,",
    "we conventionally define a flare using the following criterion : at least two consecutive time bins must have larger fluxes than the quiescent bin by @xmath20-level , where the quiescent bin is the minimum time bin in each observation . under this criterion , we detect six , three , and two flares from doar 21 , roxs 21 and roxs 31 , respectively .",
    "these are labelled as `` f '' , `` f1 '' , `` f2 '' , and `` f3 '' with arrows in figure [ fig : lc_c1 ] and [ fig : lc_a1 - 3 ] , while the quiescent phases are indicated by `` q '' .",
    "an extremely large flare with the maximum flux of @xmath1100 times higher than the quiescent level is detected from roxs 31 ( figure [ fig : lc_a1 - 3]c ) and is separately treated in  3.4 .",
    "the background - subtracted acis spectra of each source using all the data of obs c1 are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "several emission lines from highly ionized elements such as o , ne , na , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe are seen , hence the spectra are characteristic of a thin thermal plasma .",
    "we therefore fit the spectra with a thin thermal plasma model allowing the abundance of each element with prominent lines ( indicated by arrows in figure [ fig : spec ] ) to be free .",
    "for the study of time variation of the spectra , we separately fit the flare and quiescent spectra as shown in figure [ fig : lc_c1 ] . a single - temperature ( 1-t ) thin - thermal plasma model ( mewe et al .",
    "1985 ) is not acceptable for all the spectra except doar 21 and the flare phase of roxs 31 .",
    "we therefore fit two - temperature ( 2-t ) plasma models for roxs 21 and roxs 31 and find acceptable fits .",
    "table [ tab : spec ] shows the best - fit parameters .",
    "all the elemental abundances are below the solar photospheric values @xcite except for ne in doar 21 and na in roxs 21 .",
    "the best - fit abundances are displayed in figure [ fig : abund_doar21 ] with the order of the fip .",
    "we investigate the na overabundance seen in roxs 21 in further detail , because na is a relatively rare element compared with the major 4n nuclei and the na lyman-@xmath6 line lies near the lyman-@xmath21 line of the more abundant element ne .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_roxs21_1kev]a shows the best - fit result when the na abundance is correctively varied with the `` other '' elements .",
    "a significant data excess is found at @xmath131.2 kev , near the lyman-@xmath21 line of ne ( 1.211 kev ) .",
    "the intensity ratio of lyman-@xmath21 to -@xmath6 lines of ne should increase with increasing plasma temperature , but stay almost constant at @xmath13 7 for plasma temperatures higher than 1 kev ( mewe et al .",
    "therefore 1/7 of the lyman-@xmath6 flux should be an upper - limit to the lyman-@xmath21 line flux .",
    "since the flux of the ne lyman-@xmath6 line is fairly strong , the lyman-@xmath21 line flux is well constrained as seen in fig 5a .",
    "thus the excess flux should originate from another element ; the lyman-@xmath6 line of na ( 1.236 kev ) is the best candidate . allowing the na abundance to be a free parameter",
    "improved the fit as demonstrated in figure [ fig : spec_roxs21_1kev]b .",
    "the reduction of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) from 114 ( 97 ) to 108 ( 96 ) is significant with @xmath198 % confidence level for the @xmath24-test @xcite .    using the gis spectra of doar 21",
    ", we investigate the long - term ( @xmath1yr ) behavior of the spectral parameters . since the energy resolution does not allow us to separate the emission lines from the key elements , we correctively varied the abundances .",
    "the best - fit luminosity shows long - term variability in the range @xmath25 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the best - fit temperatures and abundances also vary from 2.5 to 4 kev and 0.15 to 0.5 solar , respectively ; both are possibly correlated to the x - ray luminosity as are shown in figure [ lx_kt_abund]a and [ lx_kt_abund]b .",
    "the @xmath26 value is consistent with being constant , although weak variability within a factor @xmath13 2 can not be rejected .",
    "we note that although the 1-t model in the medium resolution x - ray spectra may lead to an error in abundance by a factor @xmath12 @xcite , such an effect is significantly reduced with 2-t or multi - t models .",
    "since we used 2-t models for 2 out of the 3 sources , the artificial abundance uncertainty should be better constrained .      for the study of the spectral evolution during the flare , we make and fit time - sliced gis spectra of the giant flare from roxs 31 in obs a2 ( figure [ fig : lc_a1 - 3]c ) .",
    "the time intervals are shown in figure [ fig : flare_roxs31 ] ( left ) .",
    "the spectra show strong k@xmath6 emission of he - like fe at @xmath136.7 kev , hence we let the fe abundance vary .",
    "the flare spectra are well fitted with a 1-t model .",
    "the best - fit parameters for each time interval are shown in figure [ fig : flare_roxs31 ] ( right ) .",
    "as shown in the figure , this flare has an unusual time profile .",
    "the light curve increases slowly over @xmath115 ks ( see also skinner 2000 ) .",
    "the temperature reaches its peak value before the flux maximum , and stays nearly constant during the decay phase .",
    "the absorption ( @xmath26 ) and abundances dramatically change from quiescent to flare ; @xmath26 in the flare is @xmath17.1@xmath1910@xmath27 @xmath12 , @xmath12 times smaller than that of the quiescent phase ( obs c1 ) of 1.7@xmath1910@xmath11 @xmath12 , and the abundances increase by a factor of 330 from quiescent ( z = 0.010.1",
    "z@xmath28 ) to the giant flare ( 0.260.29 ) .",
    "these parameters , however , do not change during the flare .",
    "we have detected six ( doar 21 ) , three ( roxs 21 ) and two ( roxs 31 ) flares under our flare criterion ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the total exposure time of the four observations is @xmath17 days , hence the flare rate is one per 1.2 , 2.3 , and 3.5 days for doar 21 , roxs 21 and roxs 31 , respectively .",
    "we also confirmed the high flare rate of doar 21 in obs c2 , although the data suffer from photon pile - up .",
    "two possibilities could account for the higher rate in doar 21 : differences of the energy band ( doar 21 : 0.59.0 kev , versus roxs 21 and roxs 31 : 0.51.5 kev in obs a1a3 ) and the mean count rate ( doar 21 : @xmath10.4 counts s@xmath5 , versus roxs 21 and roxs 31 : 0.040.09 counts s@xmath5 in obs c1 ) .",
    "in fact , limiting the gis data of doar 21 to 0.51.5 kev reduces the number of flares ( under our criterion ) to two ( f2 in obs a2 and f in obs a3 ) , similar in number to those of roxs 21 and roxs 31 . also , the higher count rate of doar 21 results in a higher sensitivity to smaller amplitude flares that can be detected under our criterion (  3.2 ) . indeed , both flares in figure [ fig",
    ": lc_c1]a have smaller amplitudes than those in figure [ fig : lc_c1]b and c. conversely , at similar sensitivities , the flare rate of roxs 21 and roxs 31 may be comparable to that of doar 21 , in spite of different ages ( doar 21 , @xmath110@xmath2 yr ; roxs 21 and roxs 31 , @xmath110@xmath3 yr ) and different structure ( roxs 21 and roxs 31 are binaries , while doar 21 may be a single star ) .    the typical flare rate of x - ray sources in the taurus - auriga - perseus region ( stelzer et al .",
    "2000 ) is 1/(45 ) days ( assuming a typical decay time scale of 1 hour ) .",
    "therefore we predict significantly higher flare rates than that reported previously .",
    "the higher duty ratio may be primarily due to the extended sensitivity in the hard x - ray band ( @xmath291.5 kev ) and their brightness , because the flare activity ( flux increase ) is clearer in the harder x - ray band and/or for brighter sources as we have already demonstrated for doar 21 in the previous paragraph and in figure [ lx_kt_abund]a .",
    "the high - quality spectra of the long _ chandra _ acis exposure reveal that the 2-t models gives a better fit for overall spectra than the 1-t models for roxs 21 and roxs 31 .",
    "this supports previous 2-t model fits for some fraction of other bright ttss @xcite .",
    "doar 21 , on the other hand , displays a simple 1-t spectrum with @xmath303 kev ; hence it has no additional soft component . since the age of doar 21 ( @xmath110@xmath2 yr )",
    "is younger than that of roxs 21 and roxs 31 ( @xmath110@xmath3 yr ) @xcite , coupled with the result of @xcite that 2-t spectra are found more often in older ttss than in younger protostars , we speculate that the soft component , probably a relatively steady corona , is generated gradually as the system increases in age , finally reaching solar - like corona . in this scenario , the hard component would be the sum of unresolved flares .",
    "the coronal abundances of the ttss are sub - solar , consistent with the previous results . from figure [ fig : abund_doar21 ]",
    ", we see that both high - fip ( ne and ar ) and low - fip ( na , mg and ca ) elements show higher abundances than the other elements ( the ifip and fip effects ) .    for the abundances in solar corona",
    ", the fip - effect appears in elements with fips below 10 ev ; these elements are collisionally ionized in the photosphere at 60007000 k temperature , and would be preferentially transferred to the upper coronal region by electric fields @xcite .",
    "doar 21 and roxs 21 are a k0 star and a binary of k4 with m2.5 , respectively , and hence have photospheric temperatures of 40005000 k , 0.60.8 times that of the solar photosphere @xcite .",
    "therefore the fip - effect energy - limit of 10 ev should be shifted to 68 ev , which is near mg ( fip = 7.8 ev ) and ca ( 6.1 ev ) , but well above na ( 5.1 kev ) .",
    "hence , the abundance enhancements of mg , ca and na provide independent evidence supporting the universality of the fip - scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of our tts sample are a few @xmath19 @xmath31 ergs s@xmath5 , which is significantly higher than typical fip sources of @xmath32 ergs s@xmath5 ( such as the sun , @xmath33 uma , and @xmath34 ori ; gdel et al .",
    ". the high luminosity may also be responsible for the ifip effect we observed .",
    "a related issue would be the dramatic abundance increase in the giant flare of roxs 31 .",
    "a scenario for the ifip effect was proposed by @xcite .",
    "a `` downward - pointing '' electric field is produced by the high - energy non - thermal electrons during x - ray active phase , and suppresses the transfer of the ionized low - fip elements into the corona .",
    "the electrons also loose their kinetic energy at the photosphere by the collisional process and then heat up the cool elements , making the abundance increase during the flare .",
    "the radio gyro - synchrotron emission from doar 21 and roxs 31 further supports this idea , because this is the direct evidence for the presence of the high - energy electrons .",
    "since the abundance increase should be correlated with the non - thermal radio flux variations , simultaneous radio and x - ray observations would help to constrain physical models .",
    "another possibility is photo - ionization by coronal x - rays .",
    "this was proposed to explain a solar flare in which ne is enhanced relative to o @xcite .",
    "the ifip effect is seen in the x - ray brightest stars with @xmath35 = 10@xmath3610@xmath37 ergs s@xmath5 ( hr 1099 , brinkman et al .",
    "2001 ; ab dor , gdel et al .  2001a ; yy gem , gdel et al .",
    "2001b ; ii pegasi , huenemoerder et al .  2001 ; and tw hydrae , kastner et al .",
    "2001 ) , in which large x - ray photo - ionization may occur .",
    "the abundances increase in the x - ray flare may also be explained by this scenario .",
    "the unusual giant flare from roxs 31 shows 1-t plasma emission , in contrast to the quiescent phase .",
    "the flux of the soft component in the quiescent phase is 10100 times lower than that of the flare flux .",
    "hence it is highly possible that the soft component does exist during the flare but is hidden by the more luminous harder component .",
    "the peak luminosity of @xmath110@xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 and temperature of @xmath110 kev are comparable to the giant flare of another tts binary system v773 tau @xcite . however",
    ", the time profile of the plasma temperature is different from that of v773 tau ; the temperature arrives at the peak value preceding the flare peak , and , in the decay phase , stays nearly constant at 45 kev .",
    "these imply the existence of successive energy release due to the magnetic reconnection and that the generation and heating of the plasma occur even in the decay phase , as suggested by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenon is also seen in long duration event ( lde ) flares of the sun @xcite .",
    "the abundance and absorption during the giant flare are systematically larger and smaller than those in the quiescent phase ( table [ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "this could be due to evaporation of photosphere and environments by high - energy electrons , which may be produced just after magnetic reconnection .",
    "evaporation by the flare x - rays may not be important , because the abundances and absorption do not change much during the flare .",
    "thus , in the case of the ifip effect in the giant flare of roxs 31 , the high - energy electron origin is more likely than x - ray irradiation scenario .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "chandra _ and _ asca _ data of the three x - ray - bright ttss , doar 21 , roxs 21 , and roxs 31 . based on the timing and spectral features",
    ", we derived several results as follows ;    1 .",
    "six flares in the 0.59 kev band are detected from doar 21 during the total duration of @xmath17 days .",
    "also , three and two flares are detected from roxs 21 and roxs 31 , respectively , with _",
    "chandra _ in 0.59.0 kev and _ asca _ in 0.51.5 kev . converting to the 0.5 - 9 kev band sensitivity , the flare numbers become nearly the same as doar 21 . thus the flare rate of these ttss may be extremely high ( about one per one day ) .",
    "the spectra of doar 21 are well fitted with a 1-t model , while those of roxs 21 and roxs 31 need additional soft components .",
    "this can be interpreted as a gradual generation of the soft component with the increasing age .",
    "we found relative abundance enhancements in both the low - fip ( na , mg and ca ) and high - fip ( ne and ar ) elements .",
    "an unusual giant flare is detected from roxs 31 .",
    "the temperature remains high ( 45 kev ) even during the decay phase , suggesting a successive energy release .",
    "a large abundance and absorption jump from quiescent to flare is found , which may suggest a large contribution to gas evaporation from the photosphere and environments by non - thermal electrons .",

    "<S> we present the _ chandra _ acis and _ asca _ gis results for a series of four long - term observations on doar 21 , roxs 21 and roxs 31 ; the x - ray brightest t - tauri stars ( ttss ) in the @xmath0 ophiuchi cloud . in the four observations with a net exposure of @xmath1 600 ksec , we found six , three and two flares from doar 21 , roxs 21 and roxs 31 , respectively ; hence the flare rate is fairly high . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of doar 21 are well fitted with a single - temperature plasma model , while those of roxs 21 and roxs 31 need an additional soft plasma component . </S>",
    "<S> since doar 21 is younger ( @xmath110@xmath2 yr ) than roxs 21 and roxs 31 ( @xmath110@xmath3 yr ) , these results may indicate that the soft component gradually increases as t - tauri stars age . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances are generally sub - solar and vary from element to element . </S>",
    "<S> both high - fip ( first ionization potential ) and low - fip elements show enhancement over the mean abundances . </S>",
    "<S> an unusual giant flare is detected from roxs 31 . </S>",
    "<S> the peak luminosity and temperature are @xmath110@xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 and @xmath110 kev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature reaches its peak value before the flux maximum , and is nearly constant ( 45 kev ) during the decay phase , indicating successive energy release during the flare . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances and absorption show dramatic variability from the quiescent to flare phase . </S>"
