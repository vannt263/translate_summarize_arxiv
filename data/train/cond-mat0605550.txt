    "let us consider a system of fermions described by a real wave function @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes fermions coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "due to the antisymmetry , there exists a subset of fermion configurations for which the wave function vanishes and this subset is called the fermion node .",
    "the fermion node can be implicitly defined by @xmath4 , assuming that the nodal set does not include configurations for which the wave function vanishes because of other reasons , eg , boundary conditions . in general , for @xmath5 spin - polarized fermions in a @xmath6-dimensional space , the fermion node is a @xmath7dimensional manifold ( hypersurface ) .",
    "it is a well - known fact that for @xmath8 the antisymmetry alone does not specify fermion nodes completely .",
    "this is not difficult to understand since antisymmetry fixes only lower - dimensional coincidence hyperplanes with dimensionalities @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the fermion nodes and their properties are determined by interactions and many - body effects .",
    "the fermion nodes play an important role in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods which belong to the most promising and productive approaches for studying quantum many - body systems .",
    "let us briefly describe the basic idea of qmc and its relationship to fermion nodes . consider a hamiltonian @xmath10 and a trial function @xmath11 which approximates the ground state @xmath12 of @xmath10 within a given symmetry sector .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a real parameter ( imaginary time ) .",
    "this imaginary time projection can be conveniently carried out by simulating a stochastic process which maps onto the imaginary time schrdinger equation .",
    "the wave function is represented by an ensemble of @xmath2-space sampling points which are propagated according to @xmath15 and for large @xmath14 the ensemble becomes distributed according to @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , the straightforward application of this idea to fermionic systems encounters a fundamental complication in the fermion sign problem @xcite .",
    "the fermion sign problem makes qmc studies of large fermionic systems difficult since the statistical errors of fermionic expectation values grow exponentially in the projection time @xmath14 and also in the number of particles @xmath5 .",
    "one possibility for avoiding the fermion sign problem is to employ the fixed - node approximation which restricts the fermion node of the solution @xmath12 to be identical to the fermion node of an appropriate trial function @xmath11 .",
    "the fixed - node approximation introduces an energy bias which scales as the square of the difference between the exact and approximate nodes and therefore the accuracy of fermion nodes becomes very important .",
    "in particular , for the exact node one can obtain the exact energy in computational time proportional to a low - order polynomial in @xmath5 .",
    "the fixed - node approximation has been very successful even for rather approximate nodes of commonly used trial wave functions which are based on hartree - fock ( hf ) determinants or a few - determinant post - hf expansions .",
    "the fixed - node qmc electronic structure calculations using hf or post - hf nodes usually recover between 90 and 95 % of the correlation energy and energy differences agree with experiments typically within a few percent .",
    "such encouraging results have been observed across many systems such as atoms , molecules , clusters and solids @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that qmc methods have enabled us to `` corner '' the correlation energy problem into the last few percent of the correlation energy using algorithms which polynomial scaling .",
    "unfortunately , for many problems even a few percent of the correlation energy can be significant .",
    "typical examples are transition metal systems where the fixed - node error can be of the order of several evs .",
    "it is therefore clear that better understanding of fermion nodes could be an important step forward for the qmc methodology and beyond .",
    "in addition , the fermion nodes are related to other physical quantities and could shed light on other many - body phenomena which currently are not completely understood . in order to introduce the basic properties of the fermion nodes and to illustrate the problems involved we will first mention a few unique cases of interacting systems for which the nodes are known exactly .",
    "these examples include a few two- and three - electron atomic states , namely , triplets of he atom @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xcite and the exact node of a three - electron atomic state @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the wave functions of these high symmetry states can be parametrized by appropriate coordinate maps in which the node is described by a single variable .",
    "for example , in the case of he triplet @xmath17 state the corresponding `` nodal coordinate '' is @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 . for the triplet @xmath18",
    "the relevant variable is @xmath23 assuming that the @xmath24 state is oriented along the @xmath25-axis which is specified by the unit vector @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "for the quartet state @xmath19 the node is captured by the variable @xmath27 .",
    "the node in these systems is encountered whenever the corresponding variable , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , vanishes .",
    "the nodal surface divides the space of fermion configurations into nodal cells , sometimes also called domains . (",
    "the name nodal cell was introduced in the previous paper @xcite . in algebraic geometry and topology nodal cells",
    "are usually called nodal domains , see , for example , ref .",
    "we will use both of these two expressions interchangeably . )",
    "the few known examples of exact nodes mentioned in the preceding paragraph help to illustrate an important point , which has been conjectured for the fermionic ground states for some time @xcite , namely , that the ground state node divides the configuration space into the minimal number of two nodal cells : a `` plus '' cell with @xmath30 and a `` minus '' cell with @xmath31 . from the node equation @xmath32 of the @xmath17 state we easily find that the `` plus '' and `` minus '' domains are given by the conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "for the node given by @xmath35 the nodal domains are given by the orientation of @xmath36 : the three vectors are either left- or right - handed , corresponding to either `` plus '' or `` minus '' cell , respectively .",
    "similarly , for the node @xmath37 the domains are given by the left- or right - handedness of the vectors @xmath38 .",
    "the minimal number of two nodal domains was found also for @xmath39 and @xmath40 noninteracting spin - polarized homogeneous electron gas with periodic boundary conditions for up to 200 particles using a numerical proof @xcite .",
    "understanding the fermion nodes and their properties has become a challenge which might help to advance both practical calculations but also open a deeper insights into the properties of fermionic systems .",
    "one can envision two key problems :    \\a ) _ topology of the fermion nodes , ie , how many nodal cells are actually present _ since this is of high importance for the fixed - node qmc approaches .",
    "note that if the number of nodal cells is incorrect ( typically _ higher _ than it should be since mean - fields such as hf have tendency to divide the configurations space into too many domains ) then the qmc sampling around the artificial nodes will be very sparse .",
    "this could lead to large statistical fluctuations from poor sampling , and , possibly , to an effective non - ergodicity due to the finite - time projection time in practical calculations .",
    "\\b ) once the topology is correct , _ the accuracy of the manifold shape becomes important .",
    "_ this is an area where our insights are particularly limited since the exact nodes for large interacting systems are virtually unknown except for a few - particle special cases mentioned above .    in our recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have made some encouraging steps forward in trying to understand the topological issues and we have analytically derived a number of new results regarding the number of nodal domains .",
    "in particular , we have shown that spin - polarized closed - shell ground states of noninteracting harmonic fermions in @xmath41 and higher have the minimal number of two nodal domains .",
    "we have proved the same for spin - polarized atomic states with several electrons , both for noninteracting and hf wave functions .",
    "we have also shown that by imposing additional symmetries one can generate more than two nodal domains but that interactions can relax this `` nodal degeneracy '' to the minimal number of two domains such as in the case of the @xmath42 atomic state .    for noninteracting spin - unpolarized systems ,",
    "ie , with both spin channels occupied , the number of nodal cells is four since the wave function is a product of spin - up and spin - down slater determinants ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "( here and later on we assume that the hamiltonian does not include spin - dependent terms so that the particle spins are conserved .",
    "the wave function is then a product of two determinants which depend only on the spatial degrees of freedom @xcite . ) in the last few years , studies of a few - particle systems have revealed that interactions and many - body effects do affect the nodal topologies and can change the number of nodal cells @xcite . in particular , for the case of be atom it has been found that the noninteracting / hf four nodal cells of the singlet ground state change to the minimal number of two due to the electron correlation @xcite and qualitatively the same has been observed in other systems @xcite . in our recent paper @xcite",
    "we have found that this is a rather generic property of ground states in interacting systems . with some conditions , we have explicitly demonstrated that interactions lift the `` nodal cell degeneracy '' in spin - unpolarized systems and smooth out the four noninteracting cells into the minimal two .",
    "we have shown this for @xmath39 harmonic fermions in closed - shell states _ of arbitrary size _ using a variational bardeen - cooper - schrieffer wave function .",
    "in this work we further advance these ideas .",
    "we analyze the fermion nodes in a number of other paradigmatic fermionic models : homogeneous electron gas with periodic boundary conditions , particles in an infinite well and on the surface of a sphere .",
    "for all these systems we prove that in the spin - polarized noninteracting closed - shell ground state the fermion nodes divide the configuration space into minimal two cells for arbitrary number of particles .",
    "we also extend our previous proof for spin - unpolarized systems demonstrating that interactions smooth out multiple nodal cells of noninteracting / mean - field wave functions into the minimal two for more systems such as homogeneous electron gas and @xmath40 harmonic oscillator .",
    "these results contribute to our understanding of the fermion nodes and their impacts on the accuracy of wave functions with direct implications for the qmc methods .    in the last sections we show how in periodic spin - unpolarized interacting fermion gas the pairs of particles can wind around the box without crossing the node what points towards the connection of nodes to the transport and to the existence of other quantum phases such as superconductivity .",
    "finally , we then generalize the results to the temperature density matrices with the implications for path integral monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the basic properties of fermion nodes as they were studied by ceperley @xcite some time ago .",
    "\\a ) nondegenerate ground states wave functions fulfill the so - called tiling property .",
    "let us define a nodal cell @xmath44 as a subset of configurations which can be reached from the point @xmath45 by a continuous path without crossing the node .",
    "the tiling property says that by applying all possible particle permutations to an arbitrary nodal cell one covers the complete configuration space .",
    "note that this _ does not _ specify how many nodal cells are there .",
    "\\b ) if @xmath46 nodal surfaces cross then the angle of crossing is @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry of the node is the same as the symmetry of the state .",
    "\\c ) it is possible to show that there are only two nodal cells using the following argument based on triple exchanges .",
    "let us first introduce the notion of particles connected by triple exchanges .",
    "we will call the three particles @xmath48 _ connected _ if there exists a triple exchange path @xmath49 which does not cross the node .",
    "if more than three particles are connected then they can form a connected cluster .",
    "an example of six particles connected into a single cluster is sketched as follows :    ( 12,7.5)(6,4.5 ) ( 2,5)@xmath50 ( 6,2)@xmath50 ( 6,8)@xmath50 ( 10,5)@xmath50 ( 14,2)@xmath50 ( 14,8)@xmath50 ( 3.5,7)(7.7,4)(7.7,10)(3.5,7 ) ( 7.7,10)(15.8,4 ) ( 7.7,4)(15.8,10)(15.8,4 )    .",
    "if there exists a point @xmath51 such that _ all _ the particles are connected into a single cluster then @xmath1 has only two nodal cells .",
    "this can be better understood once we realize the following two facts .",
    "first , any triple permutation can be written as two pair permutations .",
    "therefore the connected cluster of triple permutations enables to realize any even parity permutation without crossing the node . that exhausts all permutations which are available for cell of one sign since the wave function is invariant to even parity permutations .",
    "second , the tiling property implies that once the particles are connected for @xmath51 the same is true for the entire cell . by symmetry ,",
    "the same arguments apply to the complementary `` minus '' cell which correspond to the odd permutations .",
    "more details on this property can be found in the original ref .",
    "we consider a system of spin - polarized noninteracting fermions in a periodic box in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "the spatial coordinates are rescaled by the box size so that we can use dimensionless variables and the box becomes @xmath52 .",
    "we first analyze the fermion nodes for @xmath53 since the result will be useful in subsequent derivations .",
    "we consider a system with @xmath54 particles . in",
    "our @xmath55 dimensionless units the fermi momentum becomes an integer , @xmath56 .",
    "the one - particle occupied states are written as @xmath57 @xmath58 and the spin - polarized ground state is given by @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th particle coordinate and @xmath62 .",
    "we factorize the term @xmath63 out of the determinant so that the slater matrix elements become powers of @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting vandermonde determinant can be written in a closed form and after some rearrangements we find @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a constant prefactor which is unimportant for our purposes .",
    "( in the derivations below we will be using the letter @xmath69 for denoting prefactors which are either constants or nonnegative functions in particle coordinates and therefore do not affect the nodes ) .",
    "the derived wave function has the following important properties .",
    "\\a ) the fermion nodes appear at the particle coincidence points .",
    "this implies a well - known result that the ground state wave function in @xmath55 have @xmath70 nodal cells since any particle permutation requires crossing the node at least once .",
    "in addition , this also means that _ any _ fermion configuration which preserves the particle order is contained within the same nodal domain / cell .",
    "\\b ) the wave function is invariant to translations and cyclic exchanges of particles . due to the periodic boundary conditions this includes also winding the system around the periodic box , ie , the translation of all particles by @xmath71 .",
    "we can formalize this by introducing an operator @xmath72 which translates all the particles along the @xmath73-axis as @xmath74 so that the translation invariance can be written as @xmath75    similarly , the wave function is invariant to cyclic exchange of all the particles given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this action is carried out by @xmath78 operator where the notation means the exchange by one site is in the @xmath79-direction .",
    "clearly , the inverse operator @xmath80^{-1}=c_{-1}^x$ ] .",
    "note that here we have assumed that @xmath5 is odd , in agreement with our definition .",
    "the invariance holds only for @xmath5 odd since then the cyclic exchange is equivalent to an even number of pair exchanges . for the sake of completeness , we consider also @xmath5 even , when the cyclic exchange can be replaced by an odd number of pair exchanges , resulting in the wave function sign flip . in general , for the cyclic exchanges we can therefore write @xmath81    \\c ) assuming the particle positions are all distinct , the cyclic exchange _ path _ can be chosen in such a way that it _ does not cross the node_. this is easy to accomplish by maintaining finite distances between the particles along the path trajectory .",
    "let us parametrize the exchange path by a parameter @xmath82 so that the path starts at @xmath83 , the path is completed at @xmath84 and the exchange path operator is then denoted as @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the fact that the path does not cross the node ( ie , the path is contained within the same nodal cell ) can be then written as @xmath87 where , of course , @xmath5 is assumed to be odd .",
    "let us now derive the wave functions and generalize the results for fermions in @xmath39 .",
    "the one - particle states in @xmath39 are @xmath88 .",
    "the states are occupied up to the fermi momentum @xmath89 so that we have @xmath90 , where @xmath89 in @xmath39 is not necessarily an integer . similarly to our previous paper @xcite , we show that the spin - polarized electron gas for closed - shell ground states have only two nodal cells .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the three particle wave function is given by @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath68 is a constant .",

    "[ fig:2dho]b .",

    "[ fig:2dho]b it does not . for six particles in the positions outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dho]d the wave function is clearly nonvanishing since we can write @xmath94 where @xmath68 is some constant ( in fig .  [ fig:2dho]d we have @xmath95 ) .",
    "alternatively , the six particles can be positioned in pairs as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dho]c where the particles are positioned on the hf node so that the noninteracting wave function vanishes .    for the sake of completeness we provide the expression for the wave function for a general system with size @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 \\label{eq:2dho}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath100 .",
    "the particles with indices in the subset @xmath101 lie on a circle with the radius @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the prefactor is again a nonnegative function of @xmath104 which has no impact on the nodes and is constant for rotations . from the last equation we see that in cases when @xmath96 is even , eg , @xmath105 , we end up with factorization of the type @xmath106 particles while for @xmath96 odd , eg , @xmath107 , we get @xmath108 .",
    "that means that the last three particles ( @xmath96 even ) or the last six particles ( @xmath96 odd ) can be always arranged into possibilities as sketched in fig  [ fig:2dho]a - d .",
    "it is now clear that we can prove that the spin - up and -down configuration space are interconnected for the cases when @xmath109 as specified above . using the alternative configurations for three and six particles we can arrange the systems into such positions that the rotation by @xmath93 exchanges odd number of pairs in both spin channels . for example",
    ", if @xmath5 is odd and @xmath110 is even we position three particles on a triangle as given in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dho]b .",
    "that takes out one pair from the @xmath110 exchanges and the proof then follows using the arguments for @xmath40 harmonic fermions . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath5 is even and @xmath111 is also even , we position one particle of each spin at the origin and five from each spin channel on a circle .",
    "this eliminates three pairs from @xmath111 and again we end up with remaining number of pairs being odd so that the rest of the proof follows similarly to the @xmath40 case .",
    "let us now prove the two nodal cells for the spin - unpolarized closed shells for @xmath8 homogeneous gas with interactions .",
    "we use the relevant definitions introduced previously for the spin - polarized periodic fermion gas ( section iii.a . ) .",
    "we assume a @xmath39 system of @xmath112 particles in the spin singlet ground state where the one - particle states occupy the bloch states within the fermi disk with the radius @xmath89 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath113 particle case and we position the particles as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dhegunpol ] .",
    "the wave function is translationally invariant therefore the action of @xmath114 leaves the wave function unchanged . assuming first that there is no interaction , we see that the translation exchanges the particles @xmath115 but due to the invariance the wave function value does not change : that is possible only if the particles are sitting on the node .",
    "this also agrees with expressions for the wave functions derived before ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : five2dxi ] . )",
    "consider now that we switch - on interactions and describe the particles by the bcs wave function as given above .",
    "the pairing orbital for the noninteracting gas is given by @xmath116\\ ] ] where we used the occupied orbitals @xmath117 .",
    "the correlated part is given by @xmath118 @xmath119 \\label{eq:2dcorr}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 includes the next two unoccupied stars of states with @xmath121 and @xmath122 is a variational parameter .",
    "periodic box @xmath123 . for clarity ,",
    "the five down - spin particles are not shown .",
    "the spin - down particles are positioned in the same pattern on two lines @xmath124.,width=144 ]    unlike for the noninteracting wave function ( ie , @xmath125 ) the bcs correlated wave function does not vanish and this is indeed the case due to the arguments presented above .",
    "the slater matrix of uncorrelated wave function has linear dependency while for the correlated case there always exists a configuration of lines with nonvanishing wave function .",
    "this is due to the elimination of the linear dependency through addition of virtual orbitals , as explained for the @xmath40 harmonic oscillator .",
    "note that as soon as the wave function is translationally invariant the wave function does not vanish for the whole translation path , implying that the spin - up and -down nodal domains are interconnected and the wave function has only two nodal cells .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the proof to arbitrary size closed - shell system .",
    "the configuration of particles can be given as follows : an odd number of pairs ( eg , one ) in each spin channel is positioned in a similar way as in [ fig:2dhegunpol ] so that the translation by @xmath93 exchanges the particles in the pair .",
    "for example , for a spin - up pair @xmath126 we specify the coordinates as @xmath127 and @xmath128 where @xmath129 is distinct from @xmath73 coordinates of the rest of particles with the same spin .",
    "the rest of the particles is positioned in such a way so that the @xmath130 brings them into a symmetric position regarding the reflection around axis @xmath131 .",
    "the wave function is translationally invariant and therefore uncorrelated wave function vanishes while for bcs case it is , in general , nonzero .",
    "the two nodal cells property then follows using the same general arguments as in the previous cases .",
    "the correlated wave function has another important property namely that one can wind around the periodic box a singlet pair of particles ( ie , spin - up and spin - down pair ) without hitting the node .",
    "indeed , this is implied by the fact that there are only two nodal cells : once this is the case one can then always find such a path that the pair of particles can wind around the box without node - crossing .",
    "for example , for the ten - particle example above we can wind spin - up and -down particle pair around along @xmath132 without hitting the node . we plot the wave function for two types of particle positions : first , the spin - down particles are at identical positions as the spin - down ones , ie , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , etc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind]a ) ; second , the particles in spin - up and -down channel were offset by small displacement @xmath135 @xmath136 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wind]b .",
    "consider now the simultaneous translation @xmath137 of the particles 1 and 6 .",
    "this translation winds the pair around the box and the wave function values for the paths are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind]a , b .",
    "the value of the displacement between the particle positions neither the repositioning of the particles around the box is not crucial and there exists a significant size subspace of particle positions for which the winding of the pair is possible . we have chosen just two simple examples as qualitative illustrations .    note that the wave function enables to wind also a single particle without the node crossing .",
    "however , single particle winding is possible both for correlated and uncorrelated wave functions since , say , the spin - up hf part has two nodal domains and correlated wave function only smoothes out the hf nodes . therefore this property is not affected by the correlation in any significant manner .",

    "the case here illustrates that this property stems from interconnected spin - up and -down subspaces and therefore applies to similar two nodal cell wave functions , in general .",
    "it is well known that a fermi liquid , such as the homogeneous electron gas , becomes unstable to a weak attractive interaction , develops cooper pair instability and opens the superconductivity gap @xcite .",
    "this effect is captured by the bcs wave function which we used in the proof above .",
    "cooper pairs can therefore wind around the box without hitting the node although this effect is not exclusive to cooper pairs only . in fact , the connectedness of spin - up and -down subspaces is a rather generic property in the sense that it appears also in systems which are not necessarily superconducting , ie , in fermi liquids with repulsive interactions .",
    "since superconductivity is characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and a number of other properties , which might or might not be related to the nodal topologies , on the basis of the analysis of the bcs wave function above one expects that the nodal opening _ necessarily _ appears in the superconducting state , however , for the superconductivity to occur this condition is not sufficient . in addition , here we assume only the simplest @xmath138wave pairing ; for the @xmath139wave or higher angular momentum pairing the situation is less clear and needs to be further investigated .",

    "note that this density matrix is universal since at sufficiently high temperatures the interactions become irrelevant .",
    "there are several ways how to prove that the high - temperature density matrix has only two nodal cells .",
    "for very small @xmath141 one can use the induction as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath5 particles are described by the density matrix given by eq .",
    "[ eq : dm4 ] and the particles are connected by triple exchanges for a fixed @xmath155 .",
    "we add an additional particle with the label @xmath156 to the system which occupies a certain region of the configuration ( free ) space .",
    "the particle @xmath156 is positioned at the border of the occupied region and let us assume that the particles with labels @xmath157 and @xmath5 are its closest neighbours .",
    "let us move the three particles @xmath158 away from the rest without crossing the node ( what can be always done by appropriate positioning ) .",
    "since for small @xmath141 the overlaps of gaussians become small , one can factorize the determinant into a product of the three particles @xmath159 determinant and the determinant for the rest .",
    "for the three particles the density matrix has only two nodal cells as one can show easily @xcite and therefore the additional particle is connected .",
    "this applies to both @xmath2 and @xmath144 subspaces since they must have identical properties .",
    "( in what follows we will show that , in fact , at high temperatures the primed and unprimed spaces are connected as well . )",
    "there is also an alternative proof which is interesting also on its own since it provides a different view on the density matrices .",
    "note that the functional form of the free particle density matrix has a unique property . comparing the eq .",
    "[ eq : dm4 ] with the bcs wave function ( eq .  [ eq : bcs ] ) we see that the high - temperature density matrix can be identified with a bcs wave function if we properly define an underlying effective model . instead of our original system of @xmath5 spin - polarized fermions ,",
    "let as consider a model system with @xmath112 particles so that the configurations @xmath2 and @xmath144 denote positions of these _ different _ sets of particles , which we will call for simplicity unprimed and primed particles .",
    "let us then define a new hamiltonian @xmath160 with an effective quadratic interaction between the unprimed and primed particles as given by @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 denote kinetic energy operators for the corresponding sets of particles and @xmath164 is a constant with appropriate dimensions . note that particles within the given set , say , unprimed , are antisymmetric but otherwise do not interact with each other .",
    "the interaction appears only between the primed and unprimed degrees of freedom as given by the hamiltonian @xmath165 . for @xmath166",
    "the exact wave function for this system is a bcs wave function @xmath167 $ ] where the indices @xmath168 and @xmath61 label unprimed and primed particles , respectively .",
    "the pairing function @xmath169 is obviously the gaussian given above .",
    "it is not too difficult to demonstrate that this wave function ( and the density matrix ) has only two nodal cells .",
    "for example , we can expand the gaussian into plane waves @xmath170 where @xmath171 are expansion coefficients .",
    "the sum is over states within the fermi sphere of a periodic box which accommodates @xmath112 particles for a given density .",
    "let us specify that @xmath5 is large and @xmath141 is such that the system can be considered classical so that the actual interaction in the original hamiltonian @xmath10 is irrelevant",
    ". then the density matrix corresponds to the hartree - fock product @xmath172{\\rm det}[e^{-i{\\bf k}_i\\cdot { \\bf r'}_j } ] \\label{eq : dm7}\\ ] ] however , we have already proved that such system has only two nodal cells .",
    "in addition , if the sum includes also `` excited states '' ( ie , beyond the fermi sphere ) due to the primed - unprimed interactions , we find that the unprimed and primed nodal cells are interconnected .",
    "therefore at classical temperature @xmath148 the density matrix has only two nodal cells and then the same is true for arbitrary @xmath173 .",
    "this primed - unprimed interconnection becomes less pronounced and ceases to exist at @xmath174 since then the density matrix is proportional to the `` noninteracting '' product @xmath175 where @xmath16 is the ground state for the original physical system of @xmath5 fermions described by @xmath10 .",
    "this proof is therefore based on an interesting duality between the @xmath5 spin - polarized fermions at classical temperatures and the model system with @xmath112 particles with a temperature - dependent , harmonic interaction between the unprimed and primed subspace particles .    possibly , there might be also a third way how to prove the minimal number of nodal cells for the high - temperature density matrix through diagonalization of the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath176 ( we have not investigated this possibility ) .",
    "the fact that also the density matrices have two nodal cells is important for the path integral monte carlo methods which for fermions often employ the fixed - node approximation adapted for the path integrals @xcite .",
    "inspired by previous conjectures and numerical studies @xcite the presented analysis and proofs generalize and clarify the properties of ground states fermion nodes .",
    "we have employed symmetries , wave function factorizations and triple exchanges to prove that for @xmath8 the closed - shell ground states have two nodal cells for arbitrary number of particles in several paradigmatic models . in this paper",
    "the proofs were carried for closed shells , mainly to avoid additional complications from degeneracies and some of these aspects will be addressed in subsequent papers .",
    "it is perhaps more interesting to discuss viable possibilities when the ground state wave functions might have _ more than two _ nodal cells . clearly , it is easy to generate more nodal cells by imposing additional symmetry or boundary conditions .",
    "another possibility comes from very strong interactions , for example , whenever the effect of interaction would become competitive with the kinetic energy increase from forming additional nodes it is possible that more than the minimal two nodal cells can form .",
    "one can also construct nonlocal interactions which would violate some of the properties mentioned here ( eg , the tiling property ) , or reorder the states so that , for example , excited states could lie below the ground state , etc .",
    "another candidate for unusual effects in the nodal structure are open - shell systems with large degeneracies and densities of states at the fermi level .",
    "some of these interesting issues will be subject of future studies .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented a number of new results which reveal the structure of nodes and nodal cells of fermionic wave functions .",
    "building upon ideas introduced in previous paper we were able to demonstrate the minimal number of two nodal cells in several spin - polarized models such as noninteracting fermions in a periodic box , in a box with zero boundary conditions , fermions on a spherical surface , etc .",
    "this enabled us to formulate a theorem which states that in @xmath8 the minimal two nodal cells are present for any slater determinant with monomial matrix elements for any size which allows for a closed - shell nondegenerate ground state .",
    "we have shown that this property extends also to cases which can not be described by the slater matrix of monomials such as the noninteracting and hf atomic states up to the @xmath0 shell .",
    "we have studied the effect of interactions on the noninteracting nodal cells of spin - unpolarized , closed - shell singlets .",
    "our results show that , in general , the interactions smooth out the noninteracting multiple nodal cells into the minimal number of two . for interacting homogeneous electron gas",
    "we have demonstrated that the two nodal cells allow singlet pairs of particles to wind around the periodic box without crossing the node .",
    "finally , we have shown that the temperature / imaginary time density matrix has very similar nodal structure and therefore the minimal two nodal cells property applies also to density matrices with important implications for path integral monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have demonstrated this by using an appropriate mapping of the density matrix onto the ground state of a model systems with twice as many particles interacting with temeperature - dependent harmonic potentials .",
