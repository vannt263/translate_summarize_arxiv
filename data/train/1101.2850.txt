    "in non - equilibrium statistical physics directed percolation ( dp ) is known to be the most important universality class of phase transitions into absorbing states , playing a role comparable to the ising model in equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of this class is its robustness with respect to the choice of the dynamical rules .",
    "non - dp critical behavior is obtained only if the dynamical rules are changed substantially , e.g. by introducing additional symmetries , quenched randomness , or algebraically distributed long - range interactions .",
    "recently miller and shnerb  @xcite studied the one - dimensional contact process with a single defect .",
    "the contact process is a version of dp with random - sequential updates following the reaction - diffusion scheme @xmath0 and is often used as a simple model for epidemic spreading .",
    "depending on the rate @xmath1 for particle creation , it displays a second - order phase transition between a fluctuating phase and the absorbing state ( empty lattice ) taking place at the critical point @xmath2 .",
    "miller and shnerb implemented a defect at a particular site , where the birth rate @xmath1 is modified by the amount @xmath3 .",
    "starting the process with a single active seed at this particular site , they observed that the survival probability @xmath4 measured at @xmath5 exhibits a power law @xmath6 with a varying exponent @xmath7 depending on @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is surprising since the variation of a rate in a _",
    "single _ site can be considered as a boundary effect which usually does not modify the universality class of the process in the bulk .",
    "one should not confuse this with boundary induced phase transitions into an absorbing state @xcite , where the special dynamical rules in the boundary site generates the phase transition .",
    ", while for bonds originating at the defect site ( bold line ) this probability is modified by @xmath9 .",
    "the figure shows a particular configuration , where a cluster of active sites ( blue dots ) generated by an active seed at the defect site survives until time @xmath10 .",
    "those bonds for which ",
    "if cut  the cluster would not have survived until @xmath10 are called red bonds and are marked in red color .",
    "right : decay of the survival probability in a critical bond dp with a defect for various values of @xmath9.,width=604 ]    in this paper we explain these findings . considering the density of so - called red bonds at the defect site it turns out that the actual decay of the survival probability at criticality does not obey a power law , instead it is dominated by",
    "a stretched exponential .",
    "our findings are confirmed by improved numerical simulations .",
    "in this section we derive an expression for the survival probability in dp with a weak defect , using the notion of so - called red bonds .",
    "since red bonds are usually discussed in the context of directed bond percolation , we will use this realization of dp instead of the contact process throughout the paper .",
    "let us first consider dp without a defect . for a given cluster of sites connected by bonds , a bond is called ` red ' if its removal would break up the cluster into two pieces . in the context of the present problem , where we study the survival of a dp cluster generated from a single seed , the red bonds of a cluster surviving until time @xmath11 are those which , if removed , would turn the cluster into a non - surviving one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    in dp , the density of red bonds",
    "is closely related to the off - critical behavior of the model . to see this",
    "let us consider an ordinary bond - dp process without defects at criticality @xmath12 and ask the question how the survival probability will respond to an infinitesimal variation of the global control parameter @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that for a given realization of open and closed bonds a seed at the origin has generated a cluster that survives until time @xmath11 .",
    "let us then slightly decrease the percolation probability by @xmath9 and ask for the probability that the cluster turns into a non - surviving one . clearly , by decreasing @xmath13 ( using the same set of random numbers ) some of the conducting bonds of the cluster will be removed .",
    "if the removed bond happens to be a red bond , the cluster breaks up into to pieces and becomes non - surviving .",
    "therefore , the response of the survival probability to a variation of @xmath13 is directly related to the actual number of red bonds .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath14 be the total number of red bonds of the cluster and consider a small change of the percolation probability @xmath15 by @xmath16 in a system without defect .",
    "then the survival probability will respond to lowest order by @xmath17 with some model - dependent constant @xmath18 , so that to leading order the change is given by @xmath19 since a change of the percolation probability will lead to a breakdown of the algebraic behavior of the survival probability at a time scale of the order @xmath20 , we can immediately conclude that the total number of red bonds in a cluster scales as @xmath21 .",
    "let us now turn to directed percolation with a single defect .",
    "here the situation is analogous to the one described before , the difference being that @xmath13 is not changed globally but only at the site from where the cluster was generated .",
    "therefore , the response of the survival probability will be determined to leading order by the number of red bonds originating from this particular site , meaning that one simply has to replace the total number of bonds @xmath14 by the number of red bonds in the center , denoted as @xmath22 .",
    "since we can expect the density of red bonds to be roughly constant in the interior of the cluster , the ( time - integrated ) number of red bonds in the center will be approximately proportional to @xmath14 divided by the typical spatial volume of the cluster @xmath23 .",
    "this means that @xmath22 is expected to scale as @xmath24 using this scaling law we expect the survival probability to behave to leading order as @xmath25 with some non - universal constant @xmath18 .    ) .",
    "the graph shows the same data as in fig . 1 multiplied by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the effective survival exponent averaged in the time interval from @xmath28 to @xmath29 time steps .",
    "in this representation , clean power laws would appear as horizontal lines . however , the numerical data ( black ) exhibits a clear curvature depending on the strength of the defect .",
    "the suggested stretched exponential  ( [ eq : fit ] ) fitted to the data by adjusting the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 captures this curvature convincingly .",
    ", width=415 ]",
    "the argument presented in the previous section implies that the survival probability in 1 + 1-dimensional dp with a single defect should decay as @xmath32 provided that @xmath9 is small and negative . in order to verify this formula",
    ", we performed extensive list - based seed simulations in a virtually infinite one - dimensional system , averaging over @xmath33 to @xmath29 runs depending on @xmath9 and over @xmath29 time steps .",
    "note that the simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite cover only 30.000 time steps , - a much smaller range where the curvature of the data in loglog representation was probably not easy to see .    to demonstrate the non - algebraic behavior , we first determined the effective exponent @xmath27 by an ordinary power - law fit over four decades of time ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 monte carlo steps ( see table 1 ) .",
    "then we multiplied the data by @xmath26 : in a loglog representation a clean power law would give a horizontal line so that even tiny deviations are much easier to see .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , there is a systematic curvature depending on the strength of the defect .",
    "a non - linear fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) over four decades reproduces this curvature accurately .",
    "it is surprising that the formula , which was derived in the limit of small and negative @xmath9 , works very well for positive @xmath9 and even up to @xmath34 , which is more than 30% away from the critical point .",
    "the corresponding estimates of the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 are listed in table  1 .",
    ".numerical estimates of the effective exponent of the survival probability ( average slope of the data without error margin ) and the fit parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 for various values of the defect strength @xmath9 ( see text ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as an additional check , we verify the prediction that the second fit parameter @xmath31 should be proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath35 listed in table 1 is approximately constant except for large values of @xmath9 , where we see a small deviation .      besides the survival probability , seed simulations provide data for the total number of active sites @xmath36 averaged over all runs and the mean square spreading from the origin @xmath37 averaged over all surviving tuns . in critical dp without defects , these quantities scale as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    , the survival probability @xmath42 , and the ratio @xmath43 in seed simulations of dp with a single defect at the origin . , width=453 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the quantity @xmath36 shows similar deviations like @xmath42 if the defect strength @xmath9 is varied .",
    "however , the quotient @xmath43 , which can be interpreted as the number of active sites averaged over surviving runs only , seems to exhibit clean power laws .",
    "this quotient divided by the expected power law @xmath44 is shown on the right hand side of the figure . as can be seen , small deviations of next leading order are still visible .",
    "nevertheless the quotient @xmath43 approximates a power law much better than @xmath36 and @xmath42 in itself .",
    "dp with a defect can also studied by simulations with homogeneous initial states .",
    "for example , we may ask how the density at the defect site decays as a function of time starting with a fully occupied lattice .",
    "it turns out that this density decays in the same way as the survival probability analyzed above .",
    "this is no surprise since rapidity reversal , a symmetry implying @xmath42 and the density at the `` seed site '' starting with fully occupied lattice to decay with the same exponent , holds also in presence of a defect . a proof of this relationship is given in appendix a.",
    "in this work we have shown that a single defect in 1 + 1-dimensional dp does not change the universality class of the process , opposed to the conclusion obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . for weak defects with @xmath45",
    "we derived a formula for the survival probability by considering the density of red bonds at the defect site .",
    "we note that in the extreme case @xmath46 the defect site acts as an absorbing boundary . even in this case",
    "the universality class of the bulk process does not change , instead one obtains an interesting boundary critical behavior with a new surface critical exponent  @xcite . away from this point , this boundary critical phenomenon breaks down and the defect site has no influence in the renormalization group sense , instead it manifests itself as a correction of certain quantities such as the survival probability in form of a stretched exponential .",
    "it is well known that directed bond percolation without defects has the special property that the time reversal symmetry is exact .",
    "it can be checked easily that this proof can be generalized to percolation probabilities with any type of quenched disorder , including the single defect as a special case .    in order to make sure that this symmetry is not an artifact of directed bond percolation but valid in any realization of dp , we show here that the time - reversal symmetry also holds in the contact process for transition rates @xmath1 depending on the lattice position .",
    "the calculation below is similar to the proof of time - reversal symmetry for the homogeneous contact - process presented in  @xcite .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we define the creation and annihilation operators @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the operator @xmath49 for the cp is given by @xmath50+\\sum_{<ij>}\\lambda_i[(\\hat{a}_i-1)\\hat{a}_i^\\dagger\\hat{a}_j^\\dagger\\hat{a}_j].\\ ] ] the density of particles at some site @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "note that only configurations with a particle at @xmath51 `` survive '' the action of the operator @xmath54 .",
    "if the initial condition is a fully occupied lattice we have @xmath55 the pseudo - hermitian operator @xmath56 obeys the relation @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 . note that a possible inhomogeneity of the creation rate has no influence on the last equality .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ c3thisequation ] ) implies that @xmath60 since @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we obtain the final result @xmath63 this proves the time reversal symmetry in the contact process with position - dependent creation rates .    the fact that time reversal symmetry holds provides a direct way of observing that a single defect site does not alter the universality class .",
    "if the density of active sites ( averaged over the whole lattice ) starting with a fully occupied lattice is measured we expect a clean dp decay exponent , which imply in the single defect site generating a transient effect that is felt near enough the boundary .",
