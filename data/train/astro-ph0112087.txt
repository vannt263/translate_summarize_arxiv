    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources are commonly interpreted in terms of nonthermally emitting shocks associated with relativistic ( and possibly highly collimated ) outflows from stellar - mass black holes or strongly magnetized and rapidly rotating neutron stars ( see , e.g. , piran 1999 and mszros 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "the prompt high - energy emission is thought to originate in the outflow itself , with the @xmath7-rays attributed to internal shocks within the flow and with the associated optical `` flash '' and radio `` flare '' emission ascribed to the reverse shock that is driven into the outflowing material as it starts to be decelerated by the inertia of the swept - up ambient gas . by contrast , the longer - term , lower - energy afterglow emission ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) is attributed to the forward shock that propagates into the ambient medium . the ambient gas is usually taken to be either the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy or a stellar wind from the grb progenitor star .",
    "it appears that most of the observed emission from grbs and their afterglows represents synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in view of source - energetics considerations ,",
    "the emission efficiency must be high .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath0 of the internal energy in relativistic electrons and positrons to the total internal energy density in the emission region is not much smaller than 1 , and that the ratio @xmath1 of the magnetic - to - internal energy densities is not much smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "if the shocked gas consists of protons and electrons , then only moderately high ( @xmath8 ) values of @xmath0 may be expected even under optimal circumstances ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath0 to approach 1 , it is probably necessary for the preshock gas to be composed primarily of @xmath9 pairs .",
    "a pair - dominated outflow is , in fact , a feature of certain grb models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the radiative efficiency of the reverse shock ( and possibly also of the forward shock during the early afterglow phase ) could be enhanced through pair creation by the high - energy photons comprising the gamma - ray pulse ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , no natural way to account for large values of @xmath0 during the later phases of afterglows in a typical ism or stellar - wind environment .",
    "it is in principle also possible to account for comparatively large values of @xmath1 in internal and reverse shocks by appealing to shock compression of magnetized outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter gk ) .",
    "however , in the case of afterglows in the standard scenario , the highest values of @xmath1 that might be attained in this fashion ( e.g. , in a shock propagating into a magnetized wind from a progenitor star ; see @xcite ) could at best account only for the low end of the actual range inferred in grb afterglows ( @xmath10 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , one could not explain in this way the estimate @xmath11 ( derived by model fitting of one of the most comprehensive spectral data sets obtained to date ) in the grb 970508 afterglow ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this source is also fairly high ( @xmath12 ) . ]    as an alternative to compressional amplification of a preshock field , various proposals have been advanced for generating strong magnetic fields in the shocks themselves , but it is still unclear whether any of them can naturally account for a source like grb 970508 . for example , medvedev & loeb ( 1999 ) suggested that a two - stream instability behind the shock can generate fields that fluctuate on the very short scale of the plasma skin depth .",
    "however , the most likely value of @xmath1 predicted by this scheme is rather low ( @xmath13 ) , as is also the value of @xmath0 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; furthermore , questions have been raised about whether the fields will not , in fact , be damped on a similar microscopic scale ( gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "thompson & madau ( 2000 ) suggested that acceleration of the preshock gas by the prompt gamma - ray pulse photons would induce shearing motions that could significantly amplify the ambient magnetic field .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that the preshock optical depth would be large enough for this effect to play a role for the comparatively large spatial scales ( @xmath14 ) and low preshock densities ( @xmath15 ) inferred for the grb 970508 afterglow ( see mszros et al . 2001 ) .",
    "blandford ( 2000 ) , arguing by analogy with supernovae like cas a , proposed that the afterglow emission in a source like grb 970508 arises near the contact discontinuity that separates the swept - up ambient gas from the outflowing matter , where these two components can mix and interact .",
    "the large inferred magnetic field presumably originates in the central source and undergoes additional amplification in the turbulent interaction zone , but a quantitative model of this scenario has not yet been presented . in afterglows",
    "were outlined by lyutikov & blackman ( 2001 ) . ]    in this paper we propose that the large values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 inferred in afterglows like grb 970508 arise naturally if the outflow that gives rise to the gamma - ray pulse expands into a pulsar - wind bubble ( pwb ) .",
    "such a bubble forms when the relativistic wind ( consisting of relativistic particles and magnetic fields ) that emanates from a pulsar shocks against the ambient gas and creates a `` pulsar nebula , '' whose structure is analogous to that of a stellar wind - inflated `` interstellar bubble . ''",
    "when a bubble of this type expands inside a supernova remnant ( snr ) , it gives rise to a `` plerionic '' snr , of which the crab and vela remnants are prime examples ( see , e.g. , chevalier 1998 for a review ) .",
    "grbs can arise inside pwbs under a number of plausible scenarios , some of which have already been considered in the literature . for example , gallant & achterberg ( 1999 ) suggested that , if grb outflows are formed in neutron - star binary mergers and expand into pwbs created by the progenitor pulsars , then acceleration of relativistic ions in the nebula by the forward shock could in principle account for the observed population of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "vietri & stella ( 1998 , 1999 ) presented a scenario for the origin of grbs in which a rotationally supported `` supramassive '' neutron star ( smns ) forms either by a supernova explosion that is triggered by the collapse of a massive star or as a result of mass transfer in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) . in this picture , the neutron star loses angular momentum ( and associated centrifugal support ) through a pulsar - type wind until ( on a time scale of several months to several years ) it becomes unstable to collapse to a black hole ( a process that , in turn , induces a grb outflow ) .",
    "vietri & stella ( 1998 , hereafter vs ) noted the analogy between the proposed `` supranova '' remnants and plerionic snrs , but they did not explicitly address the structure of smns wind nebulae and their implications to grb afterglows .",
    "the afterglow sources observed to date are associated with `` long '' bursts ( of duration @xmath16 ) and are often found within the projected image of the host galaxy .",
    "such sources could plausibly arise in the collapse of ( or the merger of a compact object with ) a massive star ( e.g. , woosley 2000 ) , although an lmxb progenitor may also be consistent with the data ( @xcite ) . in view of the evidence that at least some afterglow sources are located along the line of sight to a star - forming region ( e.g. , mszros 2001 ) , we adopt the supranova version of the smns scenario ( vs ) as the underlying framework for our discussion . in ",
    "2 we estimate the physical parameters of smns winds and of supranova remnants in light of recent work on plerions , and we then model the structure of the resulting pwbs . in ",
    "3 we consider the expected properties of grb afterglows that originate in such an environment .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "supramassive neutron stars are general - relativistic equilibrium configurations of rapidly rotating neutron stars whose masses exceed the maximum mass of a nonrotating neutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . a uniformly rotating smns that loses energy and angular momentum adiabatically",
    "while conserving its total baryon mass follows an evolutionary sequence that brings it to a point where it becomes unstable to axisymmetric perturbations , whereupon it undergoes a catastrophic collapse to a black hole . in their supranova model",
    ", vs postulated that the smns , which forms in the course of a supernova explosion of a massive star , is magnetized and loses energy and angular momentum through a pulsar - type wind .",
    "modes in the smns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is an alternative loss mechanism .",
    "however , in view of the uncertainties involved in quantifying this process , we follow vs and neglect it in the ensuing discussion . ]",
    "the rate of energy loss can be estimated from the magnetic dipole - radiation formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the polar surface magnetic field , @xmath19 is the circumferential radius ( neglecting the distinction between its equatorial and polar values in this approximation ) , and @xmath20 is the ( uniform ) angular velocity ( whose maximum value is @xmath21 ; e.g. , @xcite ) . , where @xmath22 is the angle between the rotation and dipole axes .",
    "however , as the spin - down torque of radio pulsars is evidently largely independent of the value of @xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we did not include this factor in equation ( [ l_w ] ) . ]",
    "the magnetic field amplitude in this estimate is normalized by the typical radio - pulsar value .",
    "this situation is to be distinguished from scenarios in which a magnetized rotator with a much stronger field ( @xmath23 ) is invoked to account for the grb outflow itself ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the initial neutron - star magnetic field might be amplified to such strengths by differential rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) or through dynamo action ( e.g. , @xcite is shorter than the convective overturn time @xmath24 at the base of the convection zone , where @xmath25 is the neutrino heat flux in units of @xmath26 , the expected value for a typical supernova explosion . since the energy released in a supranova explosion may be significantly larger than in a typical supernova , and",
    "since the neutron - star mass is also higher in this case , the neutrino flux could be similarly larger and the convection condition might not be satisfied , which would be consistent with the assumption that the smns magnetic field does not exceed typical pulsar values . ] ) .",
    "for the comparatively low field amplitudes adopted in the supranova scenario , the dynamical effect of the magnetic field on the smns structure should be negligible ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wind power @xmath27 consists of electromagnetic and particle contributions .",
    "the magnetic field is expected to have a dominant toroidal component , which scales with distance @xmath28 from the center as @xmath29 . under ideal - mhd conditions ,",
    "the poynting - to - particle energy flux ratio in the wind is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the field amplitude and @xmath32 is the rest - mass density ( both measured in the fluid frame ) , and it remains constant along the flow after the terminal speed is reached .",
    "there has been a great deal of debate in the literature about the value of @xmath33 in relativistic pulsar outflows and about whether an ideal - mhd description is appropriate ( see , e.g. , arons 1998 and @xcite for discussions of this topic ) .",
    "for example , dynamical and radiative models of the crab pulsar nebula have yielded preshock values of @xmath33 in the range @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "could be higher in this source .",
    "] on the other hand , recent x - ray observations of the vela pulsar nebula have been interpreted as implying @xmath35 ( @xcite ) . in the vela nebula",
    "is , instead , @xmath36 ; an even lower upper limit was given by chevalier ( 2000 ) , who proposed that @xmath37 in this source .",
    "] in view of this uncertainty , and in order to examine the dependence of our model results on this parameter , we derive solutions for @xmath33 in the range @xmath38 .",
    "we also need to specify the lorentz factor @xmath39 and the composition of the outflow .",
    "spectral ( e.g. , @xcite ) and optical brightness - distribution ( @xcite ) models of the crab nebula have implied a current value of @xmath40 for @xmath39 upstream of the shock . however , although these fits account for the optical  through  gamma - ray observations , they do not explain the measured radio spectrum .",
    "in a recent model , atoyan ( 1999 ) interpreted the latter as being produced by a relic population of relativistic electrons that had been accelerated during the early years of the pulsar and that have subsequently lost most of their energy by radiation and adiabatic - expansion losses . based on this interpretation , he argued that the crab pulsar was born with a period of @xmath41 ( as compared with previous estimates of @xmath42 ) were recently given by lai , chernoff , & cordes ( 2001 ) in the context of an interpretation of the apparent alignment of the spin axes , proper motion directions , and polarization vectors of the crab and vela pulsars . ] and initially had @xmath43 .",
    "in light of this result , we adopt @xmath44 as a fiducial value in our calculations : we assume that its magnitude is roughly the same in all objects and that it does not change significantly over the smns spin - down time .",
    "the pulsar outflow could consist of @xmath9 pairs as well as ions .",
    "in fact , by modeling the wind termination shock in the crab nebula , gallant & arons ( 1994 ) inferred that the energy flux in ions is approximately twice that in pairs in that source , and we already mentioned ( see  1 ) the suggestion by gallant & achterberg ( 1999 ) that uhecrs might be identified with heavy ions in grb - associated pwbs . nevertheless ,",
    "for simplicity , we assume in our model that the smns wind is composed purely of @xmath9 pairs .. ] in this case the wind power can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fluid - frame wind particle density at a radius @xmath28 , @xmath47 is the electron mass , and @xmath48 is the wind speed . , we henceforth set @xmath49 equal to 1 in all numerical expressions . ]    the spin - down time of a rapidly rotating smns can be estimated as @xmath50 ( see vs ) , where @xmath51 is the portion of the rotational energy of an smns of mass @xmath52 and angular velocity @xmath20 that needs to be lost before it becomes unstable to collapse . , where the parameter @xmath53 measures the stellar angular momentum in units of @xmath54 and has values in the range @xmath55 for realistic equations of state ( e.g. , cook et al .",
    "1994 ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "the basic time scale is determined by the underlying physical picture of a magnetized neutron star in which a significant fraction of the binding energy is invested in rotation ( which is uniform , and thus does not lead to field amplification much above typical pulsar values ) . however , the expected variations in the parameter values that appear in equation ( [ t_sd ] ) could cause @xmath56 to range between a few months and a few years .",
    "it is instructive to compare these values with atoyan s ( 1999 ) estimate ( obtained from a fit to the crab radio data ) of the initial spin - down time of the crab pulsar , @xmath57 ( a factor @xmath58 smaller than previous estimates that assumed a fixed functional dependence of the spin - down torque on @xmath59 ) .",
    "the similarity of these estimates is consistent with the possibility that the same modeling framework may apply to both plerionic snrs and smns - driven bubbles .",
    "atoyan ( 1999 ) suggested that the initial rotation energy of the crab pulsar was comparable to that of the supernova explosion that produced it , and noted that his inferred value of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) was consistent with independent arguments ( @xcite ) that the crab nebula had originated in a normal type ii supernova event . in the case of an smns it is ,",
    "however , unlikely that the explosion energy is as large as the initial rotation energy ( @xmath62 ) , but since the energy ( @xmath63 ) deposited in the pwb is evidently of the same order as @xmath60 , the supernova ejecta ( subscript ) would be accelerated by the expanding bubble and one could obtain an approximate equality between @xmath60 and @xmath64 . for typical ejecta mass @xmath65 , this would imply @xmath66 at @xmath67 ( about an order of magnitude higher than in a typical snr ) .",
    "this estimate of @xmath68 ( which agrees with that of vs ) is supported by measurements of x - ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) and absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) features in some grb sources ( see  [ features ] ) .    in the supranova scenario ,",
    "the grb is associated with the collapse of the smns , which occurs at a time @xmath69 after the supernova explosion .",
    "unless the explosion takes place within a dense molecular cloud , the mass of the swept - up ambient medium will remain negligible in comparison with @xmath70 over this time scale and will not affect the snr dynamics . to simplify the treatment , we assume that this is the case.as a further simplification , we neglect the possible incorporation of mass from the ejecta shell into the bubble interior through evaporation by the `` hot '' shocked - wind material .",
    "this effect , which has been considered in the study of interstellar bubbles ( e.g. , @xcite ) , would be strongly suppressed if the magnetic field were strictly transverse to the flow direction , as is assumed in our model . however , even a small mean radial field component might lead to a thermal conductivity that is high enough to significantly affect the mass budget inside the bubble . ]",
    "the expanding pwb is expected to compress the ejecta into a thin shell and accelerate it ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to within factors of order 1 , the outer radius of the bubble at time @xmath56 can be approximated by the product of @xmath71 times the smns spin - down time : @xmath72 where we set @xmath73 and @xmath74 . to the extent that @xmath75 has nearly the same value in all sources ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath76 is determined by that of @xmath69 . in a similar vein , if the energy @xmath77 lost during the smns lifetime is approximately constant from source to source ( @xmath78 ) , then @xmath56 can also be used to parameterize the smns wind power : @xmath79 .    in their original proposal , vs focused on the expected effect of the supranova ejecta and smns energy release on the baryon content of the environment in which the grb occurs .",
    "this was motivated by the general requirement ( see , e.g. , piran 1999 ) that the burst energy be channeled into a region with a relatively low number of massive particles in order for the outflow to attain the high ( @xmath80 ) lorentz factors inferred in grbs . however",
    ", this property of the grb outflow is probably determined primarily by the generic properties of the central object ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) rather than by the matter - sweeping action of the ejecta and smns wind . instead of this aspect of the supranova scenario ,",
    "we emphasize here the favorable consequences of the expected delay between the supranova explosion and the grb event to the creation of pwbs in which afterglows with high inferred values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 could naturally arise .",
    ", involves the interpretation of the x - ray spectral features detected in some grb sources . ]",
    "we follow previous treatments of pwb structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in our assumptions about the basic morphology of the bubble : we take it to be spherical , with an outer radius @xmath76 , and assume that the pulsar wind propagates freely ( with @xmath81 ) until it is shocked at a radius @xmath82 .",
    "our model differs , however , from previous treatments in that we take account of nonthermal radiation losses ( which could be important during the early phase of the nebula ) and we do not assume that ideal mhd is necessarily applicable throughout the shocked - wind bubble . as has been demonstrated in the previously cited papers , a pwb that expands adiabatically with a nonrelativistic speed and that contains a large - scale toroidal magnetic field frozen into the matter corresponds to @xmath83 .",
    "such a model thus can not describe a bubble with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .. ] if @xmath86 , then the postshock flow is magnetically dominated from the start .",
    "but even if @xmath87 and the postshock value of the fluid - frame magnetic - to - particle pressure ratio @xmath88 is @xmath89 , this ratio will grow with radius @xmath28 in the bubble and , if radiative cooling is even moderately important and flux freezing continues to hold , its value will at some point increase above 1 and could eventually become @xmath90 .",
    "however , as was already argued by rees & gunn ( 1974 ) , a situation in which @xmath91 significantly exceeds @xmath5 is unlikely to persist in a real pwb .",
    "we therefore adopt an alternative formulation and drop the assumption of ideal mhd in the shocked gas at the point where the electromagnetic pressure first rises above the particle pressure .",
    "we assume , instead , that beyond that point the electromagnetic pressure in the bubble remains in approximate equipartition with the particle pressure .",
    "increases to @xmath5 were discussed by kennel , gedalin , & lominadze ( 1988 ) , begelman ( 1998 ) , and salvati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . ] for definiteness , we assume that the flow obeys ideal mhd within the wind shock and we fix the electromagnetic - to - particle pressure ratio @xmath92 in the bubble by setting @xmath93 here @xmath94 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the fluid - frame electric and magnetic fields , the subscript denotes postshock quantities , and @xmath95 is the radius where @xmath88 first increases to 1 ( assuming ideal - mhd evolution ) if @xmath96 . according to this prescription , when the postshock value of @xmath97 is less than 1 ( @xmath96 ) , the bubble flow starts out maintaining flux freezing , but if @xmath88 increases to 1 before the outer boundary is reached , it switches to a nonideal evolution ( with @xmath97 fixed at @xmath98 ) beyond @xmath95 . if , however , @xmath33 is large enough that @xmath99 , then the entire pwb volume is subject to the euipartition constraint , with @xmath97 fixed at @xmath100 . for a strong shock , the postshock value of @xmath97 can be expressed as a function of the wind magnetization parameter @xmath33 and speed @xmath49 .",

    "although one can in principle derive the appropriate expressions also for this situation [ as was done , e.g. , by bttcher & dermer ( 2000 ) in the standard case ] , we do not consider fast - cooling shocks here since the results for partially radiative shocks are more cumbersome and would unduly complicate the presentation .",
    "]    the above considerations suggest that , as a rough check of the compatibility of the pwb model with observations , one can examine the consistency of the predicted values of @xmath312 , @xmath338 , and @xmath339 with the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath297 that are inferred from the spectral data by using the standard ism model .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig4 ] indicate that , if @xmath33 is not @xmath149 , then @xmath340 typically lies in the range @xmath341 .",
    "as we noted in  1 , such comparatively large values have been inferred for the corresponding standard parameter @xmath0 even before a large body of data became available , based on emission - efficiency considerations as well as on some early model fits .",
    "these inferences have been supported by more recent analyses of the accumulating data on afterglows , which have even led to the suggestion that @xmath0 may have a `` universal '' value @xmath342 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted magnitudes of @xmath312 are larger for smaller values of @xmath33 and when the fixed-@xmath186 constraint is imposed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "however , these estimates could be lowered in real sources by the admixture of baryons into the bubble interior  either by injection at the source or by evaporation from the bounding supranova - ejecta shell ( see footnote [ evaporation ] ) .",
    "turning next to the magnetic energy - density parameter @xmath338 , we see from figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] that values in the range @xmath343 to @xmath344 are predicted by our model as @xmath33 decreases from 1 to @xmath222 .",
    "it is noteworthy that this range is consistent with the values inferred in the standard ism picture for a source like grb 970508 ( which , as we discussed in  1 , have posed a challenge for the conventional scenario ) as well as with the mean values of @xmath1 inferred for the afterglow sample of panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 ) . in this case",
    "one can again expect a reduction in the estimated parameter value as a result of the admixture of baryons ( which would reduce the cooling and the associated magnetic field compression in the bubble ; see gk ) , although other factors may also contribute to a lowering of @xmath1 : for example , the afterglow - emitting shock may not be transverse , and the electromagnetic - to - thermal pressure ratio in the diffusive regions of the pwb might be lower than the equipartition value adopted in our model .    finally , our derived values of @xmath339 are compatible with the observationally inferred preshock particle densities .",
    "the values of @xmath297 estimated in the literature under the assumption of a uniform , `` cold '' ambient medium typically span the range @xmath345 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although ( as noted in the last - cited reference ) there are examples of sources where a density @xmath346 is implied .",
    "there have also been suggestions in the literature that some afterglows originated in a medium with a density @xmath347 .",
    "as is seen from figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , our model can in principle account for all of the inferred values : the typical densities are reproduced by pwbs with @xmath348 in the range @xmath349 , whereas `` outlying '' low and high inferred densities correspond to lower ( respectively , higher ) values of the cooling parameter @xmath202 .",
    "the basic trend is for bubbles with more radiative cooling to be characterized by higher values of the equivalent density : are expected in this picture to arise in highly radiative pwbs , suggesting that such sources may be the most promising candidates for testing the predicted departures from the standard spectral scaling relations ( which , according to our preceding arguments , should be most pronounced in rapidly cooling bubbles ) . ]",
    "this follows directly from our adopted parameterization ( see  [ scenario ] ) , which implies @xmath350 .",
    "it is , furthermore , seen that the effective - density predictions are remarkably insensitive to the choice of the wind magnetization parameter @xmath33 and of the specific constraint imposed on the solution .",
    "this robustness can be traced to the fact that @xmath289 basically measures the energy density in the bubble , which , for a given choice of @xmath202 ( and thus of @xmath351 ) , is essentially determined by the wind ram pressure at a distance @xmath317 from the center .",
    "another attractive feature of the pwb scenario is that it naturally gives rise to radial profiles of @xmath6 that , depending on the cooling parameter @xmath202 and the location within the bubble ( see the plots of @xmath352 in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) , may resemble a uniform medium ( constant-@xmath315 ism or interstellar cloud ) or a stellar wind ( @xmath353 ; but note that @xmath285 strictly remains @xmath354 in these solutions ) . both types of behavior have , in fact , been inferred in afterglow sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the unique aspect of the radial distribution of @xmath6 in this picture is that it spans a range of effective power - law indices @xmath285 that can vary from source to source , and , moreover , that the value of @xmath285 appropriate to any given afterglow is predicted to change with time as the afterglow - emitting shock propagates within the bubble .",
    "this leads to a more flexible modeling framework for the afterglow evolution and can naturally accommodate cases where a value of @xmath285 that is intermediate between those of a uniform ism and a stellar wind could best fit the observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". it also explains why afterglows associated with star - forming regions need not show evidence of a stellar - wind environment ( as expected when the grb progenitor is a massive star ; in view of the derived magnitudes of @xmath355 , this model also makes it possible to understand how a source with such a progenitor could produce an afterglow with an implied value of @xmath297 that was much lower than the typical ambient density near massive stars ) .",
    "in addition , high values of @xmath6 in this picture are not subject to the objection ( e.g. , @xcite ) that they will necessarily give rise to excess extinction ( although it is also conceivable that dust destruction by the optical - uv and x - ray radiation from the grb outflow could reduce any preexisting extinction toward the source ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as is seen from figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , the predicted @xmath356 distributions exhibit progressively steeper declines as the outer boundary of the bubble is approached .",
    "this suggests that the later phases of the evolution of any given afterglow would be more likely to exhibit signatures of a stellar - wind environment . in all the @xmath357 bubbles ,",
    "this wind - like behavior becomes more pronounced the lower the value of the cooling parameter @xmath202 . since ( as noted above ) the value of @xmath289 also exhibits a systematic dependence on this parameter ( it decreases with decreasing @xmath202 ) , one may expect afterglows with higher inferred ambient densities to preferrentially indicate a uniform ism - like environment if they originate in such bubbles .",
    "the inferred radii of afterglow shocks typically lie between @xmath14 and @xmath358 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the upper limit on the bubble s outer radius ( eq . [ [ r_b ] ] ) for supranova  grb time delays of @xmath359 to @xmath360 .",
    "we can check on whether typical afterglow - emitting shocks will still be relativistic by the time they reach the outer edge of the bubble at @xmath76 by solving the adiabatic evolution equation @xmath361m_{\\rm eq}(r)+[\\gamma(r)-1]m_0 = ( \\gamma_0 - 1)m_0\\ , \\quad\\quad\\ r_s < r < r_b\\ ] ] where @xmath362 and @xmath363 ( e.g. , van paradijs et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the bottom panels in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the results for the pwb solutions presented in  [ results ] using a representative value of @xmath325 and two plausible values of @xmath296 .",
    "it is seen that , in all cases , the grb outflow decelerates rapidly after entering the bubble , and in weakly cooling pwbs the lorentz factor of the afterglow - emitting gas is at most a few by the time the shock reaches @xmath76 ( and is effectively nonrelativistic for the @xmath364 solutions ) . only in the case of an energetic shock and a strongly cooling bubble",
    "is @xmath365 appreciable ( but even then it remains @xmath366 ) .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind , however , that , if the outflow is collimated with a small opening half - angle @xmath367 , then it will start to strongly decelerate due to lateral spreading when its lorentz factor decreases to @xmath368 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , so that even the more energetic shocks could become nonrelativistic while they are still inside the pwb .. ] these results are again quite insensitive to the value of @xmath33 and to the choice of the imposed constraint ; this is not surprising in view of the fact that they depend mostly on the behavior of @xmath369 , which exhibits a similar trend .    a grb shock that reaches the supranova ejecta shell at @xmath182 with a lorentz factor @xmath370",
    "would be rapidly decelerated to subrelativistic speeds since the rest - mass energy of the shell ( @xmath371 , where @xmath372 ) is in most cases much greater than the ( equivalent isotropic ) shock energy @xmath296 .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the forward shock after it enters the shell could be evaluated once the dynamical evolution of the shock is calculated .",
    "besides the anticipated alterations in the spectral scaling laws , one may expect the numerical values of the various physical parameters to undergo dramatic changes as the shock moves from the interior of the bubble to the ejecta shell : in particular , @xmath297 would likely increase by several orders of magnitude , whereas @xmath0 and @xmath1 would probably decrease significantly .",
    "in addition , the sudden deceleration would drive a relativistic reverse shock into the grb outflow , whose emission may have an important effect .",
    "the overall outcome is likely to be a discontinuous change in the shape and evolution of the observed spectrum .",
    "ramirez - ruiz et al . ( 2001 ) modeled a somewhat similar situation that may arise when a grb shock that propagates in a stellar wind encounters a density bump .",
    "they suggested that an encounter of this type could induce a brightening and reddening of the afterglow spectrum and might explain observations of such a behavior in several sources .",
    "the situation considered by ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) differs , however , from a pwb ",
    "snr transition in that the density contrast as well as the jumps in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( which were assumed to be negligible in the `` bump in a wind '' model ) would typically be much larger in the latter case .",
    "it would thus be interesting to carry out a detailed investigation of the observational implications of the shock encounter with a dense shell in the explicit context of the pwb model .",
    "the snr shell bounding the pwb could also manifest itself by imprinting x - ray features on the grb afterglow spectrum .",
    "indeed , recent detections of such features in several grb sources have been argued to provide strong support for the supranova scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to date , four grb sources ( grb 970508 , grb 970828 , grb 991216 , grb 000214 ) , observed @xmath373 after the burst , showed emission features in their postburst x - ray spectrum , and one source ( grb 990705 ) exhibited an absorption feature that disappeared @xmath374 after the onset of the burst .",
    "these features most likely represent fe k@xmath375 lines or an iron k edge , and their detection implies that a large quantity ( @xmath376 ) of pure iron is located in the vicinity ( @xmath377 ) of the grb source .",
    "such a large iron mass is most naturally produced in a supernova explosion , and the inferred distance of the absorber indicates that the supernova event preceded the grb by at least several months , as expected in the supranova picture .",
    "the association with a supranova is further strengthened by the argument ( @xcite ) that the abundance of @xmath378fe ( the product of the radioactive decay of @xmath378ni and @xmath378co ) in supernova ejecta is not expected to become significant until @xmath379 days after the explosion , during which time the ejected gas in a source like grb 991216 ( in which the observed line width is consistent with an outflow speed @xmath380 ; @xcite ) would have traveled to a distance @xmath381 from the origin .",
    "we now proceed to discuss how the observed x - ray features can be interpreted in the context of the supranova scenario , and we consider the implications of this interpretation to the pwb afterglow model presented in this paper .",
    "we concentrate on the specific example of grb 991216 , which allows us to capitalize on the analysis already carried out on this object by piro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and vietri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; our interpretation does , however , differ in its details from the model favored by the latter authors .",
    "we approximate the ejecta as a thin spherical shell of radius @xmath382 and density @xmath383 .",
    "although the ejecta of a supernova that is not associated with a pulsar may be expected to fill the volume into which it expands , in the case of an inflating pwb the ejecta will be swept up and compressed into a dense shell ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the acceleration of this shell by the lower - density bubble gas would subject it to a rayleigh - taylor instability , which could lead to clumping ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as we argue below",
    ", such clumping is consistent with the data for grb 991216 .",
    "we assume that the emission is induced by continuum irradiation from the central region that commences around the time of the burst but is not necessarily confined to the solid angle of the grb outflow . the part of the shell that is observable to us at time @xmath172 is limited by light - travel effects , so that , for a source observed up to time @xmath384 , the solid angle @xmath385 from which fe emission is received is given by @xmath386 where the angle @xmath118 is measured with respect to the line of sight to the origin , and where we substituted numerical values appropriate to grb 991216 ( redshift @xmath387 , @xmath388 ) .",
    "piro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) identified the x - ray feature in grb 991216 as an fe xxvi h@xmath375 line ( rest energy @xmath389 ) with a fwhm ( as quoted in @xcite ) of @xmath390 .",
    "since we attribute the emission to material that moves toward the observer with a speed of that order , we favor an identification with a lower - energy line , specifically fe xxv he@xmath375 ( rest energy @xmath391 ) , but our results are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "line was presented by ballantyne & ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) , who demonstrated that an fe xxvi h@xmath375 line is unlikely to be observed because of the removal of photons from the line core by compton scattering . ]",
    "based on the photoionization models of kallman & mccray ( 1982 ) , fe xxv is the dominant ion when the ionization parameter @xmath392 ( where @xmath393 is the ionizing continuum luminosity ) lies in the range @xmath394 . using @xmath395 , with @xmath396 and @xmath397 ( @xcite )",
    ", we thus infer @xmath398 the observed line luminosity corresponds to @xmath399 ( @xcite ) , and we can write @xmath400 , where @xmath401 is the total iron mass in the shell and @xmath402 is the recombination time for a @xmath403 ion ( with @xmath404 and @xmath405 being the electron temperature and number density , respectively , and @xmath406 the ion charge ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath407 is valid in the range @xmath408 ( @xcite ) , and photoionization models imply that @xmath409 for @xmath410 ( @xcite ) . approximating @xmath411 , we obtain @xmath412    substituting equation ( [ n_ej ] ) into equation ( [ xi ] ) gives @xmath413 combining equations ( [ r_ej ] ) and ( [ delta_omega ] ) then yields @xmath414 and ( for the given fiducial values ) @xmath415 . substituting the estimate ( [ r_est ] ) into the relation ( [ xi ] ) in turn implies @xmath416 if the shell expands with a speed @xmath417 ( see  [ scenario ] ) , then its age when it reaches the radius given by equation ( [ r_est ] ) is @xmath418 this value is consistent with the time required for the bulk of the ejected radioactive @xmath378ni to decay into @xmath378fe .",
    "the electron column density in the x - ray emitting portion of the shell is given by @xmath419 , where @xmath420 is the covering factor of the shell and @xmath421 , the electron molecular weight , is 2 for hydrogen - free ejecta .",
    "assuming @xmath422 and using the estimate ( [ r_est ] ) , the thomson optical depth of the shell is inferred to be @xmath423 for these fiducial values , the thickness of a homogeneous shell would be @xmath424 , which is consistently @xmath425 .",
    "it is , however , more likely that this nominal thickness corresponds to the size of a clump in a shell with a small volume filling factor ( see @xcite ) . in fact , a high degree of clumping is also indicated by the requirement that the line photons reach the observer without undrgoing excessive compton broadening in the shell .",
    "the photoionization optical depth of the iron ions in the shell is similarly inferred to be @xmath426 where @xmath427 is the relative abundance of the fe xxv ion ( e.g. , @xcite ) and where we used @xmath428 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the estimated values of @xmath431 ( @xmath343 ) and @xmath432 ( a few ) are optimal for producing high  equivalent - width iron lines through reflection ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . since , in this picture , @xmath433 , the efficiency of producing detectable emission lines would typically be low for shells with radii much in excess of @xmath434 ( eq . [ [ r_est ] ] ) .",
    "the most natural way of relating the above scenario to the pwb model is to identify @xmath435 with @xmath56 and @xmath436 with @xmath76 .",

[ [ r_ej ] ] ) is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the lower limit on @xmath76 typically implied by the afterglow data . in particular , in the case of grb 991216 , the optical light curve showed evidence for steepening ( which was attributed to shock deceleration triggered by the lateral spreading of a jet ) starting about 2 days after the burst ( @xcite ) . for this time scale to be consistent with an emission radius @xmath438 , the relation @xmath439 implies that the flow lorentz factor must be @xmath440 .",
    "however , given the comparatively high ( @xmath441 ) equivalent isotropic energy inferred for the emitting shock , it is unlikely that the lorentz factor could become so low over such a relatively short distance ( see bottom panels in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the problem is even more acute for grb 970508 , in which the x - ray emission feature detected @xmath442 after the burst again implies an emission radius @xmath443 ( e.g. , lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ) , but where model fitting of the afterglow spectrum @xmath444 after the grb yields a radial scale @xmath445 along the line of sight to the center [ see references in  [ introduction ] ; this result is supported by radio scintillation measurements ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "these values are mutually inconsistent , since the snr shell could not have reached a distance of @xmath446 in one week even if it expanded at the speed of light . as we noted in  [ parameters ] , the afterglow emitting gas should decelerate rapidly after the forward shock encounters the snr shell , and the shock transition into the shell would likely result in a discontinuous variation in the afterglow light curve .",
    "if the radius of the shell indeed coresponds to the value of @xmath382 indicated by the x - ray emission - line data , then this is hard to reconcile with the fact that , in the case of grb 970508 , the light curve remained detectable and more or less smooth during a 450-day monitoring period , with the underlying flow evidently becoming nonrelativistic only after @xmath447 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the inferred radius of the x - ray line - emitting shell and the deduced radial distance of the afterglow - emitting shock may be reconciled within the framework of the supranova / pwb scenario if the snr shell and the pwb are not spherically symmetric .",
    "one possibility ( suggested by lazzati et al .",
    "1999 and @xcite ) is that the supernova explosion does not eject matter along the smns rotation axis , where the grb outflow is subsequently concentrated .",
    "an alternative possibility ( which we discuss below ) is that both the snr and the pwb become elongated in the polar directions because of a preexisting density anisotropy in the grb environment . under these circumstances , a highly collimated grb outflow ( such as the one inferred in grb 991216 ; @xcite ) could reach a distance @xmath14 without encountering the snr shell even as the lower - latitude regions of the shell ( from which the x - ray line emission emanates ) have radii @xmath448 . in the case of grb 991216 , where the x - ray observations lasted between 37 and @xmath449 after the burst ( @xcite ) , the inferred effective spherical radius of the x - ray emitting shell ( eq .

    "( 2001 ) deduced a radius @xmath443 using a similar scheme to the one applied here to the interpretation of x - ray line emission .",
    "they have , however , also argued that the afterglow emission properties in this object may be consistent with a shock / snr - shell encounter on this radial scale . ]",
    "the formation of a highly elongated pwb in the supranova scenario may be a natural outcome of the manner in which its environment was shaped by the progenitor star as well as of its intrinsic physical properties .",
    "the star that gave rise to an smns in a supranova event must have been massive , rapidly rotating , and magnetized .",
    "it would have influenced the density distribution in its vicinity through episodes of strong mass loss , in particular during its red - supergiant and blue - supergiant evolutionary phases .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that the `` slow '' red - supergiant wind is often anisotropic ( possibly as a result of fast - rotation and magnetic effects ) , transporting significantly more mass near the equatorial plane than in the polar regions .",
    "subsequent stellar outflows that propagate into this mass distribution will assume an elongated morphology : this has been the basis of the `` interacting stellar winds '' class of models for the shapes of planetary nebulae ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which the outflow represents the `` fast '' blue - supergiant wind , as well as of models of apparent snr `` protrusions , '' in which the outflow corresponds to the supernova ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in these applications , the subsequent outflows have been taken to be effectively spherically symmetric .",
    "however , an even stronger collimation is achieved if the later outflow is itself anisotropic .",
    "in particular , if the fast wind is even weakly magnetized ( with a dominant azimuthal field component ) , then , after passing through the wind shock where the field is amplified ( an effect that will be especially strong if cooling is important behind the shock ) , the magnetic hoop stress will collimate the resulting interstellar bubble ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as was argued by gardiner & frank ( 2001 ) , the collimation may start even before the shock is encountered ; this should be particularly pronounced in cases where magnetic stresses also play a dominant role in driving the fast wind ( as in the wolf - rayet wind model of @xcite ) .",
    "the additional collimation provided by the magnetic field was suggested as the origin of strongly elongated planetary nebulae , which can not be readily explained by purely hydrodynamic models .    a pulsar wind expanding into the anisotropic density distribution created by the",
    "earlier ( red - supergiant and blue - supergiant ) stellar outflows will give rise to an elongated bubble ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of pwb evolution in a stratified medium ) .",
    "furthermore , since the pulsar wind is highly magnetized and cooling may be important in the supranova - induced pwb ( see  [ results ] ) , the same magnetic collimation effects that are invoked in the modeling of planetary nebulae will act to increase the bubble elongation in this case too .",
    "[ in fact , the collimating effect of magnetic hoop stresses on plerionic supernova remnants was already discussed by rees & gunn ( 1974 ) ; it was subsequently modeled by begelman & li ( 1992 ) .",
    "] under these combined effects , it is quite plausible to expect that a bubble aspect ratio @xmath452 could be achieved , although this needs to be confirmed by an explicit calculation .",
    "previous numerical simulations of outflows expanding into an anisotropic medium also make it likely that the column density of the swept - up snr shell will be lower near the apex of the bubble than at larger values of @xmath118 , which should be relevant to the modeling of x - ray absorption and emission features as well as of the afterglow light curve .",
    "the expected departure of the pwb from sphericity might require a modification of the model presented in ",
    "[ structure ] , which would probably be best done with guidance from numerical simulations .",
    "we nevertheless anticipate that the results obtained from the semianalytic model would remain at least qualitatively valid .",
    "furthermore , if a strong elongation only occurs near the symmetry axis ( which would be consistent with the data for grb 991216 as well as with some of the existing numerical simulations ) , then even the quantitative predictions of the simple spherical model would still be approximately correct .",
    "we propose to identify the environment into which afterglow - emitting shocks in at least some grb sources propagate with pulsar - wind bubbles .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * pwbs provide a natural resolution of the apparent difficulty of accounting for the high electron and magnetic energy fractions ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) inferred in a number of afterglow sources .",
    "this is because pulsar winds are expected to have a significant @xmath9 component and to be highly magnetized .",
    "if high values of @xmath0 in fact prove to occur commonly in afterglow sources , then this would strengthen the case for a simple , `` universal '' explanation of this type .",
    "* an association of pwbs with grbs is expected under several grb formation scenarios , including the collapse of a massive star . in light of suggestive evidence that many of the afterglows observed to date",
    "may have a massive stellar progenitor , we have concentrated on this case . in particular , we considered the supranova scenario of vs , in which an intense pulsar - type wind from the grb progenitor is a key ingredient of the hypothesized evolution . in this picture , the ejection of a highly energetic , ultrarelativistic pulsar wind is predicted to follow the supernova explosion and to last anywhere from several months to several years until the central object collapses to form a black hole , thereby triggering the burst .",
    "recent detections of x - ray features in several grb sources have been interpreted as providing strong support for this scenario . * to assess the implications of a pwb environment to afterglow sources in the context of the supranova scenario , we have constructed a simple , steady - state model of the early - time structure of a plerionic supernova remnant .",
    "we have been guided by atoyan s ( 1999 ) spectral modeling of the crab , which yielded a lower initial wind lorentz factor and a higher initial pulsar rotation rate than in previous estimates , and by other recent results on the crab and vela synchrotron nebulae , from which we inferred a plausible range of the wind magnetization parameter @xmath33 ( @xmath453 ) .",
    "in contradistinction to previous models of the structure of plerionic snrs , we have replaced the assumption that ideal mhd applies throughout the pwb with the postulate that the electromagnetic - to - thermal pressure ratio in the bubble remains constant after it increases to @xmath454 .",
    "we have also explicitly incorporated synchrotron - radiation cooling .",
    "although our solutions do not provide an exact representation of radiative ( and thus intrinsically time - dependent ) pwbs , we have verified that they generally do not depend on the detailed approximations that are adopted and are essentially characterized by @xmath33 and by a second parameter that measures the relative importance of radiative cooling within the bubble .",
    "it would be of interest to further develop this model and to investigate the possibility that it can be applied both to young radio pulsars and to grb progenitors as members of the same general class of rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized neutron stars .",

    "* we have examined the dependence of the characteristic synchrotron spectral quantities in an afterglow - emitting shock that propagates inside a pwb on the bubble parameters and related them to the standard expressions derived under the assumption of a uniform - ism environment .",

    "<S> such bubbles could naturally account for both the high fraction of the internal energy residing in relativistic electrons and positrons ( @xmath0 ) and the high magnetic - to - internal energy ratio ( @xmath1 ) that have been inferred in a number of sources from an interpretation of the afterglow emission as synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> grbs might occur within pwbs under a number of scenarios : in particular , in the supranova model of grb formation a prolonged ( months to years ) period of intense pulsar - type wind from the grb progenitor precedes the burst . </S>",

    "<S> the model is based on the assumption of an `` equipartition '' upper bound on the electromagnetic - to - thermal pressure ratio in the bubble and takes into account synchrotron - radiation cooling . </S>",

    "<S> we show that , for plausible parameter values , @xmath6 spans the range inferred from spectral fits to grb afterglows and that its radial profile varies within the bubble and may resemble a uniform interstellar medium or a stellar wind . </S>",
    "<S> we consider how the standard expressions for the characteristic synchrotron spectral quantities are modified when the afterglow - emitting shock propagates inside a pwb instead of in a uniform interstellar medium and demonstrate that the predictions for the empirically inferred values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are compatible with the observations . </S>",
