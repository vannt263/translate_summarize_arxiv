    "planets can gravitationally perturb debris discs by various dynamical processes , such as secular interactions , where an eccentric or inclined planet can force the disc eccentricity or inclination @xcite , or resonance interactions , where the planet traps dust at a specific location , resulting in the creation of dust clumps in the disc @xcite .",
    "these processes inducing eccentricity , a disc position offset with respect to the star , or clumps into the disc can result in brightness asymmetries . due to the limitations in the detection techniques ,",
    "most of the confirmed exoplanets are located within 10  au of their host star , and potential planets located beyond this limit ( beyond saturn in our solar system ) remain undetected .",
    "however , even if those distant planets are too small to be detected with our current telescopes , they can still leave an observational signature by gravitationally perturbing the dust of their debris disc . therefore investigating the dynamical relationship between debris discs and exoplanets",
    "can not only provide some insights on the origin of debris disc asymmetries , but also provides clues to the presence of hidden planets in the outer part of stellar systems , a region currently difficult to observe .",
    "hd  115600 is a young f2 type star at a distance of 110  pc in the scorpius  centaurus association of age @xmath315 myr @xcite .",
    "although an ir excess was detected by @xcite using _ spitzer / mips _ , its debris disc was imaged for the first time in the h - band at @xmath4  @xmath5 m by @xcite using the _ gemini planet imager _",
    "( _ gpi _ ) .",
    "the observation revealed a very broad nearly edge - on disc with an observed width to mean radius ratio @xmath6/@xmath7 0.37 , which makes the hd  115600 debris disc one of the broadest ever observed  see table  [ table1 ] for the main parameters of hd  115600 .",
    "@xcite used the radiative transfer code grater to model the disc emission .",
    "they found that the disc , most likely primarily constituted of ice - icy / silicate grains , appears eccentric with @xmath8 and its projected centre offset by @xmath9 and @xmath10 compared to the stellar location leading to a total offset of @xmath11 or @xmath12  au .",
    "they proposed that such disc eccentricity and offset could have been sculpted by a potential planetary companion .",
    "the absence of a direct detection of such a companion by _ gpi _",
    "places an upper limit of the mass of the potential companion of @xmath13  @xmath14 if it is ideally located on an orbit outside the coronograph mask .",
    "the authors point out that their model , however , respectively overestimates ( underestimates ) the disc flux at the southeast ( southwest ) corner . using predictions from the gap opening model developed by @xcite , as well as the planet - stirring scenario established by @xcite , only very loose constraints on the potential planetary companion",
    "could be derived and the authors concluded that either a superjovian planet orbiting at @xmath15au or a super - earth located at the very inner edge of the disc could sculpt the disc .",
    "n - body simulations can be used to model the interaction between a debris disc and a planet . in these simulations , a disc , modeled by an ensemble of massless particles , orbits around a central body representing the star and feels the gravitational perturbation of another massive body . to test different planet configurations",
    ", a suite of these simulations must be run , and the planet parameter space ( comprised of the planet mass and orbital elements ) is traditionally explored by using a grid of set values . in this approach , the entire parameter space must be explored to isolate the best fit , and the precision of the best fit parameters directly depends on the size of the grid , and therefore a large number of simulations are required to reach high precision .",
    "given the low number of currently resolved debris discs , n - body simulations have been so far used to study individual objects , however with the increased number of expected discoveries from the latest and next generation of instruments such as _ alma _ and _ jwst _ , a more efficient and statistical approach must be found .",
    "for example , the _ monte carlo markov chain _ ( mcmc ) approach explores closely located points of the parameter space along a chain , and by accepting parameter space point resulting in better fits and rejecting point resulting in worse fits , the chain quickly converges toward the best fit region .",
    "this method has been used in astrophysics to estimate cosmological parameters with high precision @xcite , adjusting semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite or fitting planetary orbital element from transit and radial velocity data @xcite . @xcite",
    "present the first study integrating n - body simulations within an _ mcmc _ algorithm to estimate the pre - infall mass of the carina galaxy before it joins the milky way satellites group .",
    "one focus of our study is to present a framework for testing if the _",
    "algorithm can be used to more efficiently probe the parameter space of n - body simulations of a planet shaping a debris disc than a traditional grid method .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role of planets in determining the morphology of the hd  115600 debris disc .",
    "we dynamically model the interaction between an exoplanet and the hd  115600 disc using our modified n - body integrator , and explore the parameter space of the planets orbit and mass using both the sampling method _ mcmc _ and a traditional grid method . to compare the results of our numerical simulations with observations of hd  115600 , we create synthetic images from the simulations at a similar wavelength and resolution as the _ gpi _ image .",
    "thus this study has two primary aims to both test the _ mcmc _ algorithm for exploring the parameter space in n - body simulations and also provide information on a potentially hidden companion that planet hunters can use in the future searches .",
    "we first present our general method in section 2 . in order to derive the grain composition and properties",
    "required to turn our simulations into synthetic images , section 3 presents our spectral modeling of the hd  115600 disc using the radiative transfer code _ mcfost_. in section 4 , we introduce our numerical method for performing the dynamical simulations , before presenting our results in section 5 .",
    "a summary of our findings and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    ".properties for hd  115600 from currie et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while increasing the number of iterations would help derive stronger confidence intervals , we decided to keep the number of iterations low for several reasons .",
    "firstly , running dynamical simulations are computationally expensive ( a run of 720 simulations requires @xmath16 days with a eight - cores intel xeon e5 - 2660 cpu of 2.2  ghz ) and as a consequence , very few dynamical studies of debris discs in the literature use a set of more than a couple of hundred simulations  . to further ensure that enough planetary models resulting in disc parameters comparable to @xcite were explored within our limited number of iterations , we compare the disc parameters achieved by planetary models along the _ mcmc _ chain 1 with the observational parameters derived by @xcite and their associated uncertainties in figure  [ fig : c1 ]  au to derive the uncertainty on the disc width , which led to an uncertainty of 0.05 on the observational @xmath17 .",
    "after a hundred iterations , most planetary models resulted in disc parameters similar to the observational value within the observational uncertainty , and we therefore conclude that given the uncertainty associated with the observational parameters , our number of iterations is enough to probe the best - fit region with appropriate accuracy . finally , direct imaging is currently the only technique capable of detecting planets with semi - major axes @xmath18au .",
    "checking the exoplanet database for the 8 confirmed exoplanets which have been detected via imaging and with semi - major axes @xmath19au , we found that , when available , the average of uncertainties on the planetary parameters are @xmath20  au and @xmath21 . our short _",
    "runs are therefore sufficient to also provide better constraints than those derived from current observations .     +    using _ mcfost",
    "_ , we create the spectral energy distribution and synthetic image at 1.6  @xmath5 m corresponding to the best fit model  see figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "the sed of the best fit model has @xmath22 , which is larger than the @xmath23 of the best fit model using a parametric disc in section 3 to estimate the grain properties .",
    "the high @xmath24 value comes from the fact that we are trying to reproduce the disc features and emission observed in the near - ir and therefore our model , which is using small grains as they are the main contributors to the emission at short wavelengths , fails to reproduce the disc emission at the mid - ir wavelength ( 10 - 25 @xmath5 m ) accurately . on the other hand",
    ", the model reproduces the observed sed for @xmath25 m very well . the projected synthetic image at @xmath26 m produced a disc with a projected offset of @xmath27  au , and the deprojected disc has a peak brightness location of @xmath28au , a disc width ratio of @xmath29 , and an eccentricity of @xmath30 , which is a good match to the observed characteristics of table [ table1 ] within the uncertainties .",
    "to further check our implementation of the _ mcmc _ sampling method , we conduct an exploration of the parameter space using a traditional grid sampling method .",
    "we sample the parameter space as follows : we used 6 values of @xmath31 between 1040 au in steps of 5  au ; 10 values of @xmath32 between 0.05 and 0.35 in steps of 0.06 ; and 6 values of @xmath33 between 2 @xmath34 and 8 @xmath34 in steps of 1.2 .",
    "those ranges corresponds to the values typically explored in the _ mcmc _ chains ( see table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "a total of 360 models were conducted , and we aim here to compare the best fit model and the statistics of the result found when using a grid sampling method versus a _ mcmc _",
    "method for which only the first 360 iterations minus the 100 for the burn - in period are used .     +    following a grid method , the best fit ( @xmath35 )",
    "is found for the model with @xmath36au , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while by using only the first 360 simulations of the _ mcmc _ chain 1 , a better fit ( @xmath39 ) is found for @xmath40au , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "while the best fit values are in excellent agreement between the two methods , figure [ fig:7 ] shows a @xmath23 map of the grid and illustrates how the grid method can be wasteful in terms of computational effort .",
    "more than 250 out of 360 simulations returned @xmath43 , highlighting that @xmath44 of the time was spent outside of the best fit region , while the _ mcmc _ chain converged quickly toward the best fit region with all simulations having @xmath45 after the first 100 iterations .",
    "as a result , only poor statistics can be derived by following a grid method : figure [ fig:8 ] presents the marginalized probability distribution of each parameter .",
    "while the planet mass , eccentricity and semi - major axis distribution peak corresponds to the best fit model , the @xmath46 interval confidence for @xmath33 is @xmath47 and no interval can be derived for @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "if we look now at the probability distribution of each parameter derived using the first 260 iterations of the _ mcmc _ chain 1 ( the first 360 simulations excluding 100 iterations as a burn - in period ) presented as the red distribution in figure [ fig:8 ] , the distribution for all parameters peaks around the best fit value with @xmath48 , while no confidence interval can be derived for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "although these _ mcmc _ probability distributions clearly provide less constraints on the interval confidence than the distribution derived using the full mcmc iterations sample ( figure [ fig:5 ] ) , it still presents slightly more constraints on the planetary mass confidence interval than the interval derived using the grid method .",
    "au and @xmath41 , while the lines delimit the extended orbit crossing regions between the massive planet and a potential companion the mass of vesta when the asteroid is either apse aligned with the planet ( red ) or not ( blue dashed).,width=340,height=264 ]    we now examine the dynamics at work that is shaping the disc .",
    "the shaping of the debris disc by the planet is done via a mix of secular and resonant interactions , where secular interactions shape the disc eccentricity and orientation , while resonant interactions create dust traps and dictate their location in the disc . to understand and analyze the stability state of this system",
    ", we first use the criteria from @xcite to estimate the width of the chaotic zone around a planet with the best fit parameters for an asteroid of the mass of the moon used as a proxy for the total mass of the disc  see figure [ fig:9 ] .",
    "this criteria predicts than in the absence of planet - disc apse alignment , the outer stable zone around the planet is restricted to a small portion of the plot with @xmath49au and @xmath50 , while if the planet and disc are aligned , the stable zone extend to @xmath51au with @xmath52 .    at the beginning of the simulations , since the disc and planet are not initially aligned , particles with @xmath53 au and @xmath54 are rapidly removed as they lie within the chaotic zone highlighted by the red region of figure [ fig:9 ] . however , after @xmath55 years ( which corresponds to @xmath56 for this @xmath57 planet at 31.07 au to sculpt the disc at 48 au ) , secular interactions start to align the disc and planet . as a consequence ,",
    "the chaotic zone shrinks to the blue region of figure [ fig:9 ] , allowing the particles to evolve over a broader range of semi - major axes and eccentricities .",
    "30% of the initial test particles population has survived by this stage .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig:10 ] illustrates the impact of secular interaction on the disc eccentricity and orientation .",
    "initially the particles complex eccentricities ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) are restricted to the green disc of radius @xmath2 centred on the origin , which corresponds to particles having an initial eccentricity range between @xmath60 ( as set in the initial conditions ) . by @xmath61",
    ", the complex eccentricities are now precessing about the forced eccentricity , @xmath62 , as indicated by the blue arrow and form the red disc of radius @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , because the planet is initially set with its pericentre @xmath64 , the direction of the disc forced pericentre illustrated by the blue arrow is the @xmath65-axis , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "the disc and planet are therefore aligned .",
    ", @xmath59 ) of all test particles constituting the disc at @xmath67 ( green ) and at @xmath68yrs ( red ) .",
    "the blue arrow shows the location and direction of the forced eccentricity , @xmath69 , of the particles population at @xmath70 yrs .",

    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in addition to secular interactions , the disc location is also shaped by a set of resonances due to the interaction with the planet , which result in the presence of dusty clumps in the deprojected synthetic image of the best fit disc model in figure  [ fig:6 ] . at the beginning of the simulation , while 70% of the test particles are scattered by the planet , the surviving particles are clustered around 38.5 , 48 and 54 au , which correspond to the 4:3 , 3:1 and 5:2 mean motion resonances .",
    "the evolution of the semi - major axis and eccentricity of two particles trapped in the 4:3 , 3:1 and 5:2 mean motion resonances is shown in figure [ fig:10 ] .",
    "the 3:1 mmr is trapping test particles at @xmath71au and , as a result , the particles eccentricity is undergoing adiabatic growth , while the 5:2 mmr is trapping particles around 54 au .",
    "these resonances induce stability in the disc and the final disc is made of long term surviving particles with semi major axis mainly clustered around these mmrs with an eccentricity @xmath72 .",
    "the new generation of high contrast imaging instruments , such as the _ gpi _ , can reach contrasts of @xmath73 within the inner @xmath74 . using the isochrones computed by for the evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets applied to a 7 jupiter mass of a same age than hd  115600",
    ", we estimate the flux ratio contrast to be @xmath75 in the h band . while technically within the current detection threshold , there are several reasons why our best fit planet was not detected on the currie et al . image .",
    "first , given the high inclination of the system ( @xmath76 ) , the apparent orbit of the planet may be hidden by the disc emission , and secondly , most of the planet orbit is likely concealed by the coronograph mask which has an apparent radius of @xmath77au , as can be seen on the right panel of figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "we however note that a small portion of the planet s orbit around the apocentre is situated beyond the mask , and the planet at this position could be marginally detectable .",
    "in this work , we conducted a numerical search for a planet responsible for shaping the debris disc of hd  115600 recently imaged in the h band by @xcite using _",
    "gpi_.    we first use the radiative transfer code _ mcfost _ with a parametric disc structure to derive the dust grain properties needed to fit the observed sed in order to create synthetic images .",
    "we then used a modified n - body integrator which incorporates radiation forces to dynamically model the interaction between the potential companion and the debris disc , and used _",
    "mcfost _ to produce synthetic images to compare with observations .",
    "we explored the 3d parameter space ( @xmath31,@xmath32 and @xmath33 ) of the potential planet using two different methods : a classic grid exploration over 360 grid points , and a _ mcmc _ approach over 720 iterations .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * from our sed modeling , and by selecting the greenburg model where the grains are made of a core of silicate with a coating of water ice , the disc emission is best reproduced by a disc with a total dust mass of 0.2  @xmath78 with a minimal and maximal grain size of @xmath79 m and @xmath80 m .",
    "we however note that these parameters are not well constrained . * from image modeling and using the _ mcmc _ scheme to explore the parameter space",
    ", we reproduce the hd115600 disc eccentricity , projected offset , disc width and brightness peak with a @xmath57 planet located at @xmath81au with @xmath82 .",
    "such a planet shapes the disc via a mix of secular interactions forcing the disc eccentricity , orientation and offset , as well as a set of planet resonances , at 4:3 , 3:1 and 5:2 , trapping dust at @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 au respectively . *",
    "while technically detectable by _ gpi _ , the apparent and projected planet orbit is likely hidden by the disc emission as well as partially concealed by the coronograph mask due to the high inclination of the system . * using a same total number of simulations , we compared two methods of exploring the parameter space : a _ mcmc _ sampling of the parameter space versus a grid method .",
    "we find that the _ mcmc _ scheme not only finds a better fit to the observations , but also converges faster toward the best fit region .",
    "however we find that using a _ mcmc _",
    "scheme on such a short number of iterations presents some limitations : while our _ mcmc _ implementation barely passed the convergence test such as the @xcite , it also only provides weak constraints on the confidence intervals .",
    "increasing the numbers of iterations would increase the quality of the best fit estimation .",
    "we chose to conduct our study with a small number ( 720 ) of simulations for multiple reasons : first very few studies in the literature uses more than a few hundred dynamical simulations as they are computationally expensive and , secondly , after about a hundred iterations , the majority of subsequent models resulted in disc parameters comparable to the values obtained by @xcite within the observational uncertainties .",
    "finally our planetary parameters uncertainties estimated with 720 _ mcmc _ iterations are well below the current uncertainties of parameters for planets detected via direct imaging .    for low dimensional problems ( low @xmath86 ) , like our study",
    ", a traditional grid of @xmath87 points only requires @xmath88 evaluations and presents the advantage of being trivially parallelized . for higher dimensional problems",
    ", it should be noted the",
    "_ efficiently converges like @xmath89 , which is dimensionally independant and therefore a large advantage over the grid technique . in this study",
    ", we compare the efficiency of exploring our @xmath90 parameter space with a grid and a _ mcmc _ algorithm .",
    "we conclude that this work demonstrates that the _ mcmc _ scheme is a promising method to efficiently explore the parameter space of dynamical simulations and allows us to localize a better - fit region faster than the grid method , although we also stress that the limited number of simulations makes reaching the convergence state quite challenging .",
    "there are numerous schemes existing in the literature to explore multidimensional parameter spaces which could represent very good alternatives , such as the _ sparse grid mcmc _ @xcite  a scheme combining the use of both a grid and _ mcmc _ , or the use of grids of different resolutions successively @xcite .",
    "the debris disc of hd  115600 shows interesting features which can be reproduced by simulating the gravitational influence of an inner massive planet on the disc structure .",
    "additional observations of hd  115600 at different wavelengths could help constraining the planetary parameters furthermore .",

    "collisions are the assumed mechanism by which new dust is constinuously created , and following our discussion in section 4.1.2 , we assume the debris disc of hd  115600 to be either ( i ) in a steady - state where larger planetesimals collide and constinuously replenish the disc with small grains or , given the young age of the system , ( ii ) is replenished by collisions of primordial grains before all are removed by stellar radiation forces . either way , collisions are expected to occur within hd  115600 debris disc on a timescale shorter than the simulation duration , and by stacking the dust distribution over the simulation duration , at any time @xmath91 we therefore mimic the dust distribution for grains whose ages range from @xmath91 years old to those newly created .",
    "it is valid to then ask if mimicing the effect of collisions smoothens out the planet - induced features in the disc and therefore impacts the resulting synthetic disc image ( as well as the subsequent determination of the disc parameters ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : a1 ] , snapshots of the dust distribution at the early stage of a simulation ( @xmath92 ) shows a broad slighly perturbed disc , while later snapshots taken over @xmath93 ( or 45000  years ) all display a clear eccentric ring that is apse - aligned with the planet . by @xmath94 , the presence of two dust clumps corresponding to mmr trapping can be clearly distinguished and little disc evolution occurs after that .",
    "interestingly , the structure observed at @xmath94 is consistent with the disc structure illustrated in the deprojected _ mcfost _ synthetic image in figure  [ fig:6 ] , for which the dust density distribution was obtained by stacking all the snapshots over the lifetime of the simulations .",
    "therefore , because both the secular interactions and resonnance trapping occur rapidly within the disc ( see also figure  [ fig:10 ] ) , no significant difference is expected between the dust density distribution at the end of the simulations and the dust distribution obtained by stacking .",
    "a quick way to verify that the parameter space has been efficiently sampled is to have an overall acceptance rate of 25 to 40% in the _ mcmc _ chain .",
    "this requires adjusting the standard deviation of the three normal prior parameter distributions , from which a new set of parameters is drawn at every _",
    "mcmc _ step .",
    "a commonly used method is to have a some correlation stepping when drawing a new set of parameters at each _ mcmc _ iteration , meaning that the value of the standard deviation for each prior distribution is based on how the three parameters are correlated . in this section ,",
    "we provide a short description on how to achieve this but we refer to @xcite for more details .    1 .   step 1 : the method consists in initially setting the normal prior distributions with a standard deviation of @xmath95 for all parameters , and to run the _ mcmc _ chain for a few hundreds iterations .",
    "2 .   step 2 : by recording how the chain moves through the parameter space , we can estimate the covariance matrix , * @xmath96 * , of the three parameters and therefore know how the sets of parameters over all _ mcmc _ iterations are correlated .",
    "3 .   step 3 : the next stage is to adjust the standard deviation of the prior distributions so that the sets of parameters would follow the covariance we just estimated , and this requires to generate correlated random numbers .",
    "this process can be easily done by first performing a cholesky decomposition on the covariance matrix , which consists in finding an upper diagonal matrix * @xmath97 * such that * * @xmath96**=*@xmath98*. 4 .",
    "step 4 : the cholesky matrix , * @xmath97 * , then needs to be updated to * @xmath99 * to obtain a better acceptance rate , where * * @xmath99**@xmath100*@xmath97 * , with @xmath90 , the number of parameters constituting the parameter space . 5 .",
    "step 5 : the new standard deviation for each parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath102 is then obtained by applying * @xmath99 * to the vector ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "step 6 : a new _ mcmc _ chain can be run using the correlated stepping @xmath101 and @xmath102 , to generate the set of parameters at each iteration of the chain .",
    "if the new acceptance rate is not inside the ideal range , then steps 2 to 6 must be repeated until the acceptance rate enters the correct range .",
