    "[ [ section ] ] +    in the beginning of 90 s a finite - mode approximation of @xmath3 ideal hydrodynamics was introduced ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation is based on convergence of the structure constants of the lie algebras @xmath0 ( @xmath1-odd ) , when @xmath4 to the structure constants of the lie algebra _ sdiff_@xmath2 . the lie algebra _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 consists of divergenceless nonconstant vector fields on a @xmath3 torus .",
    "the vector fields are infinitesimal generators of the group of area - preserving diffeomorphisms of the @xmath3 torus .",
    "incidentally , the group can be also identified as the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms , for the natural symplectic structure of the torus .",
    "the group is the basic symmetry group for incompressible ideal hydrodynamics on a @xmath3 torus . in the physical model the fluid",
    "is maintained in a region of a plane , appropriate boundary conditions being satisfied .",
    "the approximation of",
    "_ sdiff_@xmath2 by @xmath0 is used quite widely both in hydrodynamics and in string theory @xcite .",
    "there are also other finite - mode approximations of the euler and similar equations related to symplectic geometry @xcite .    in @xcite the approach to approximate _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 is formalized and a weak uniqueness theorem is proved . unfortunately , the weak uniqueness does not lead to an isomorphism of the limit algebras .",
    "indeed , there are examples of various limit algebras which have their structure constants equal to the structure constants of some infinite dimensional algebras and despite this equality the limit algebras are not isomorphic to the infinite dimensional ones .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the @xmath5 is neither isomorphic to _ sdiff_@xmath2 nor to @xmath6 , where @xmath6 consists of divergenceless vector fields on the @xmath3 sphere @xmath7 .",
    "this approximation is still not well understood and additional work should be done towards its satisfactory formulation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in the second section",
    "we discuss the issues connected with approximating the lie algebra @xmath8 by the lie algebras @xmath0 .",
    "we point out weaknesses of this approximation .    in the third section",
    "we remind how the euler equations are being associated with arbitrary lie algebras",
    ". then we specify the lie algebras to be @xmath0 ( @xmath1 odd ) and @xmath8 . despite the weak form of convergence of @xmath0 to _ sdiff_@xmath2 , solutions of the euler equations associated to the lie algebras @xmath0",
    "converge , in a sense defined further in the paper , when @xmath1 goes to infinity , to the solutions of the euler equation associated with the lie algebra @xmath8 .",
    "proof of this fact is the central result of this paper .    in the fourth section we discuss numerical calculations within this approach and within the galerkin approximation .",
    "numerical stability of this method in comparison to galerkin one turns out to be significantly better .",
    "on the other hand , the numerical simulations demand significantly more calculation time than the galerkin one .    in the conclusions we discuss the finite - mode approximation based on the group theoretic relations as a method of choice for solving euler equation whenever",
    "numerical calculations are expected to give reliable results for long evolution times , and adequate computational power is available .",
    "we supplement the paper with an appendix , in which we discuss geometry of noncommutative tori , providing geometric interpretation of the approximation method .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ] +    in this section we remind the formal approach to the approximation of _ sdiff_@xmath2 and _ sdiff_@xmath9 algebras given in @xcite and called there @xmath10-convergence .",
    "we remind here the result on weak uniqueness ( proposition 3.3 from @xcite ) .",
    "we also discuss behavior of generators of @xmath0 in the form chosen in @xcite when @xmath1 goes to infinity .",
    "we show that their norms diverge in this limit .    in @xcite instead of algebras @xmath11 , @xmath0",
    "are considered their complexifications , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is quite a standard to consider instead of algebras _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 , _",
    "sdiff_@xmath9 , etc . , their complexifications ,",
    "so the above procedure is fully justified .",
    "it does not lead to any principal differences in comparison with our dealing with corresponding real algebras , since the structure constants remain the same and the relations of being isomorphic or non - isomorphic are preserved by complexification .",
    "let us begin with giving necessary definitions of objects appearing in this section .",
    "first , let us remind some definitions and basic facts about the lie algebras @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , as they are presented in @xcite .",
    "first , @xmath14 is defined as @xmath17 , all but finite number of @xmath18 .",
    "this is then a matrix algebra with finite support .",
    "as usual for matrix lie algebras the commutator of matrices serves as the lie bracket .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath15 is defined in the same way with the only difference that the indices of the elements of the matrices in the lie algebra are not integers @xmath19 but natural numbers @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath19 and @xmath20 are bijective , any such bijection induces an isomorphism of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , the isomorphisms are not canonical , which means they depend on the choice of a basis in each of the lie algebras .",
    "since @xmath14 and @xmath15 have only finite number of elements different from zero , there is no problem with defining the trace of the elements in these lie algebras .",
    "namely , the number of non - zero diagonal elements is also finite for all elements of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and because of that the standard definition of a trace as the sum of diagonal elements of a matrix is unchanged for both algebras .",
    "then the lie algebras @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be easily defined as consisting of those elements of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , which have trace equal to zero , and with the lie structure inherited from the algebras @xmath14 , @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the lie algebras _ sdiff_@xmath2 and @xmath16 , which are important in our further considerations , are defined in the following way .",
    "one begins with the complex vector space : @xmath23 it means a complex vector space generated by the basis @xmath24 , with indices @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integers .",
    "the following interesting lie algebra structures , indexed by @xmath28 , can be defined on @xmath29 : for @xmath30 they are defined on the generators @xmath31 by : @xmath32^\\lambda : = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\lambda}\\sin { \\left(2\\pi\\lambda(\\bar m\\times \\bar n)\\right)}t_{\\bar m + \\bar n}\\ ] ] and for @xmath33 by : @xmath32^o : = ( \\bar m \\times \\bar n)t_{\\bar m + \\bar n},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 then , as usual , the lie brackets are extended to the whole @xmath29 by linearity .",
    "these lie algebras are denoted @xmath35^\\lambda)$ ] .",
    "they are direct sums of subalgebras @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes a vector space spanned on generators listed inside the figure brackets , and the lie structure is defined by restriction of @xmath38^\\lambda$ ] to the given subspace of @xmath29 .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath16 is defined as the second summand in the above sum , @xmath39^\\lambda)$ ] . in the case",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath40 is identified with the complexified lie algebra of the nonconstant divergenceless vector fields on @xmath41 , which is the _ sdiff_@xmath2 .    since approximation of the lie algebras @xmath16 , _ sdiff _ , etc . by the algebras @xmath42 or @xmath43",
    "can not be realized in a strong sense of inductive or projective limit as it is often done for other infinite - dimensional algebras , the authors of @xcite axiomatized the concept of so called @xmath10-limit of the lie algebras .",
    "this notion is a generalization of intuitively defined limits from the papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the definition consists of two axioms .",
    "the first axiom demands existence of a special family of real or complex lie algebras @xmath44_\\alpha , \\alpha \\in i)$ ] , where the index set @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "this family should be equipped with a family of metrics @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly to the axiom there should exist another real or complex lie algebra @xmath48)$ ] such that for every @xmath49 there exists a surjective map @xmath50 and the condition @xmath51 should be satisfied .",

    "let us remind how _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 is described rigorously within the @xmath10 limit of the algebras @xmath16 when @xmath63 .",
    "one begins with the sequence of algebras @xmath64 , i.e. the sequence of algebras @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "one distinguishes an ideal @xmath67 in each algebra @xmath68 of the sequence : @xmath69 then one defines the sequence of factor algebras @xmath70 with @xmath71 the canonical projection . as the basis of each algebra in the sequence serve @xmath72 .",
    "the lie structure in each algebra of the sequence is given by : @xmath73^{(n ) } = \\frac{n}{2\\pi}\\sin{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n } ( \\bar m \\times \\bar n)\\right)}\\,\\pi_n(t_{(\\bar m + \\bar n ) mod\\ , n}).\\ ] ]    this algebra @xmath74 is exactly identical with the algebra @xmath75 with @xmath1 odd .",
    "the approximating sequence consists then of the algebras @xmath76^{(n)})$ ] with the index set @xmath45 .",
    "the surjective maps @xmath61 are identified in this case as the maps @xmath77 .",
    "the metric on each @xmath74 is induced by defining it on the generators by @xmath78 and then extending to the whole @xmath74 by linearity .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the 2 axioms of @xmath10-limit are satisfied for this sequence .",
    "therefore , the algebra _ sdiff_@xmath79 is an @xmath10-limit of the algebras @xmath12 . nevertheless , @xmath14 which is an inductive limit of the algebras @xmath12 , so it is the limit in a strong sense , is not isomorphic to _ sdiff_@xmath2 .",
    "this fact is also proved in @xcite .",
    "the above example shows that one should be careful with approximating infinite - dimensional real algebras by finite dimensional ones in such weak sense as the @xmath10-limit .",
    "we will demonstrate now another difficulty of this definition of a limit .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the renormalized basis of the lie algebra @xmath0 has divergent norm for @xmath1 going to infinity . to be more precise ,",
    "let us remind that the basis of the @xmath0 algebra which leads to the mentioned @xmath10 -approximation of _ sdiff_@xmath2 is defined as : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83\\ ] ] is a cyclic permutation matrix . then , to obtain desired form of the structure constants of the algebra , a renormalization is done by multiplying all the basis elements by @xmath84 . as a result ,",
    "the renormalized basis elements for @xmath85 become elements of infinite norm .",
    "this is in apparent contrast to the behavior of the basis elements of the algebra _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 @xmath86 , which are all of finite norm .",
    "it seems then that the algebraic arguments on approximation of _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 by @xmath0 need careful treatment .",
    "what is also of interest , especially in the context of geometric description of an ideal incompressible fluid , and its geometric quantization like in @xcite or @xcite , it is a better understanding of convergence of coadjoint orbits of the groups @xmath87 to the coadjoint orbits of the goup @xmath88 .",
    "analogous interesting question concerns the casimir functions .",
    "these in the case of @xmath87 are : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , ... @xmath91 , ... for an @xmath92 .",
    "their counterparts for the @xmath88 are : @xmath93 , @xmath94, ... ,@xmath95 where @xmath96 is the standard surface element of the torus @xmath41 .",
    "the work on this issue is in progress .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ] +    in this section we introduce the euler equation for incompressible flows of an ideal fluid on a @xmath3 torus .",
    "then we remind the definition of the euler equations connected with arbitrary lie algebras , due to arnold .",
    "next , we specify the latter equations to the case of @xmath0 lie algebras ( @xmath1 odd ) and to the case of the lie algebra @xmath8 . finally , we prove the theorem on convergence of solutions of the euler equations for @xmath0 to the solutions of the euler equation connected with the @xmath8 lie algebra .",
    "as was noticed in @xcite , the euler equations can be generalized to any lie algebra by @xmath97 where @xmath98 are structure constants of the algebra and @xmath99 is a symmetric metric .",
    "for example , g is the inverse of the inertia tensor in the case of motion of a rigid body , for which the appropriate algebra is @xmath100 ) .",
    "the summation over repeating indices is understood .",
    "now we are ready to derive the equation for the @xmath142-norm of @xmath143 @xmath144 the last equality in the chains follows from @xmath145 being real .",
    "let us observe that @xmath146 , since the sum @xmath147 by substitution @xmath148 becomes @xmath149 .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) by @xmath150 , performing the summation over @xmath151 one obtains @xmath152 where @xmath153 and where @xmath154 in the last two sumands repeats the term :    @xmath155    changing the name of the summation index does not change the value of @xmath156 . let us then introduce the change from @xmath151 into @xmath157 . as a result one",
    "gets ( @xmath158 and then we omit @xmath159 ) .",
    "@xmath160 therefore @xmath161 .",
    "now we will prove that the sequence @xmath162 defined by ( [ 11a ] ) satisfies @xmath163  when @xmath164 provided that the solution @xmath165 belongs to the sobolev space @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "we have in such a case @xmath168 and therefore @xmath169 can be represented as @xmath170 where still @xmath171 . thus denoting @xmath172 we have @xmath173 @xmath174 , which by schwartz inequality gives us @xmath175 the last sum on the right hand side",
    "is obviously bounded because @xmath176 therefore as it follows from ( [ 13a ] ) @xmath177    to prove that this double sum tends to zero for @xmath178 , we use the integral criterion ; we denote @xmath179 by introducing new variables @xmath180 ; @xmath181 , where @xmath182 we estimate @xmath183 extending integration in @xmath184 , @xmath185 on the whole @xmath186 @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the unit disc on @xmath186 , @xmath189 . for @xmath167",
    "the integral over @xmath185 is finite and we have @xmath190 where the constant @xmath191 grows to infinity for @xmath192 . therefore introducing @xmath193 we have @xmath194 noting that @xmath195 we can estimate the integral over @xmath196 splitting it in two parts as follows @xmath197 taking @xmath198 we make both exponents equal to @xmath199 and finally one obtains @xmath200 where @xmath201 . for @xmath167 , the integral over @xmath202 ,",
    "@xmath203 is finite , and thus @xmath204 for @xmath178 .    in this way we have proved that for @xmath167 the first term on the r.h.s . of eq([10a ] ) is vanishing when @xmath205 ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "it converges to zero as @xmath207 , i.e. as @xmath208 , where @xmath209 depends on @xmath210 .",

    "* theorem * if @xmath229,\\,h^{\\sigma } ( t^2))$ ] is a solution of the euler equation of hydrodynamics on the torus @xmath41 then corresponding solutions @xmath230 ( i.e. such that @xmath231 @xmath232 for @xmath233 ) of the @xmath0 euler equations are approaching @xmath102 in the norm of @xmath234 for every @xmath235 satisfying @xmath236 .",
    "the theorem proved in the last section shows that for large @xmath1 the difference between solutions of the euler equation on @xmath0 and the galerkin approximation of the euler equation for ideal incompressible fluid is negligibly small .",
    "numerical schemes usually applied to solve euler equation are based on the galerkin approximation .",
    "numerical calculations were performed to test if the group - theoretic approximation could be applied to create a better numerical scheme for solving the euler equation .",
    "there seems to be one important advantage of the group - theoretic finite - mode approach over the galerkin one .",
    "namely , the former possesses a big number of conserved quantities , which grows with @xmath1 .",
    "the galerkin approximation does not have this property . as a result of this difference",
    "one can expect higher stability of the group - theoretic approximation for long times .    in the computer simulations we adopted similar initial conditions as dowker and wolski @xcite .",
    "this means we took @xmath237 . strictly speaking",
    ", such initial conditions are not satisfying the assumptions of our theorem .",
    "however , in both approximations , it means the galerkin and the group- theoretic ones , these initial conditions lead to numerical solutions quite well approximated by the discrete ones .",
    "dowker and wolski @xcite were performing their simulations at the level of stream functions , we were doing that at the level of vorticities .    calculations in @xcite",
    "were done on a hewlett - packard workstation .",
    "we agree with @xcite that it is very difficult to go to @xmath1s big enough for a convincing numerical illustration of the convergence proved in the theorem .",
    "the complexity of the system of odes strongly depends on @xmath1 . in our case",
    "the number of equations grows linearly with @xmath1 , the number of quadratic terms in every equation grows with @xmath238 .",
    "the @xmath1 is limited not only by the execution time , but also , and in fact mainly , by the memory requirements .",
    "this is why we hope that our method will be much more effective in the future  we witness every year significant progress in memory availability .",
    "it was not our aim at this point to make calculations for the biggest possible @xmath1 , but rather to observe the numerical stability of both methods .",
    "this is why calculations were done on a pc ( pentium ii , 700mhz , 1 gb ram ) , in mathematica 4.1 .",
    "we restricted ourselves to small @xmath1s ( relatively easy simulations ) .",
    "the effect is sufficiently strong to be observed at @xmath239 .",
    "it is expected from theoretical considerations to be much more significant for big @xmath1 .",
    "we observed individual fourier modes as functions of time for both approximations .",
    "we were testing time after which the symmetry @xmath240 , ( for our choice of initial conditions ( real @xmath241 ) it was @xmath242 ) was breaking .",
    "one can easily observe big difference in times of destabilization between the two approximations .",
    "for @xmath243 and @xmath244 numerical calculations based on the galerkin method destabilize after the amount of time approximately equal to 4.5 computer units , while the group - theoretic method presented stable behavior till 20 computer time units . for @xmath245",
    "the difference was significantly bigger .",
    "namely , the group - theoretic method destabilized after about 18 units of time , while the galerkin method destabilized after 1.5 units of time . in this case the group - theoretic method was more stable than the galerkin one by a factor of 12 .",
    "this difference was significant , and we are convinced that with bigger @xmath1 and longer simulation times the difference would increase .",
    "we used in both cases exactly the same initial conditions , numerical methods , numerical accuracy and all other parameters .",
    "as an example , the results of the numerical simulations for the representative cases of @xmath239 for a pair of modes each in the galerkin and in the group - theoretic approximations are shown in figs.1 - 3 . in the graphs",
    "is presented the time dependence of the amplitudes of three particular pairs of modes with the numbers @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "they are representative for all the pairs of modes .",
    "we were looking for the instant of time when the two modes begin to behave differently showing that reliability of the simulations is lost .",
    "in this paper we studied the approximate ideal fluid description based on the observation concerning the convergence of the structure constants of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 odd ) algebras to the structure constants of the algebra _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 , and on similarity of the euler equations defined on the dual algebras of @xmath0 and _ sdiff_@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the hypothesis stated in the literature that the euler equations for @xmath0 converge to those for _",
    "sdiff_@xmath2 was carefully examined .",
    "the results are :    in addition to the fact known from the literature @xcite that the algebras @xmath248 and @xmath8 are not isomorphic , we pointed another difficulty of the approximation .",
    "namely , we have shown that in the limit @xmath85 renormalized elements of the basis of @xmath0 , used to demonstrate similarity of the strucure constants of @xmath5 and of @xmath8 , become elements of infinite norm .",
    "we proved the statement about the convergence of the solutions of the euler equations for @xmath0 to the solutions of the euler equations for @xmath8 . this way the functional analytic part of the approximation eventually found a complete proof .",
    "we performed extensive numerical simulations based on the group - theoretic and the galerkin finite - mode approximations .",
    "they showed that the group - theoretic method is significantly more reliable for long evolution times than the galerkin one .",
    "when the same numerical conditions are applied , the galerkin method leads to instabilities after evolution time at least a few times shorter than the group - theoretic one .",
    "this difference grows with the number of modes used in symulation . for n=25 group - theoretic numerical solutions",
    "were 12 times more stable than the galerkin ones .",
    "we expect the difference to be sharper for bigger numbers of modes involved . on the other hand ,",
    "the galerkin method is significantly less machine time and memory consuming than the group - theoretic one .",
    "galerkin method is appropriate for short evolution time calculations , performed with limited computational power . with given machine power at hands one can obtain solutions for short evolution time using the galerkin approximation for bigger @xmath1 than using the group - theoretic one .",
    "the long time scale solutions of the euler equations are used in meteorology , in weather prediction , as well as in studying oceanic flows , to name just a few applications .",
    "the group - theoretic method would allow to improve long time scale predictions reliability in the mentioned areas .",
    "it currently requires powerful workstations for implementation . with dramatic growth of computational power and the memory size in recent years , in a few years",
    "the group - theoretic method should be easier to apply than it is at the moment .",
    "noncommutative tori are one of the simplest examples of noncommutative spaces , which are a subject of study in noncommutative geometry . in this appendix",
    "we present material on noncommutative tori , which is relevant for the finite - mode approximation discussed in the paper .",
    "the paradigm of noncommutative geometry grew up from the gelfand - naimark theorem , accordingly to which the category of hausdorff , locally compact topological spaces is dual to the category of commutative @xmath249-algebras .",
    "the commutative @xmath249-algebras are algebras of continuous complex - valued functions ( with compact support in the case of noncompact spaces ) on the spaces .",
    "the @xmath249-algebras of continuous functions on compact spaces are additionally unital , with the unit given by the constant function equal to one .",
    "constant functions can not have compact support on noncompact spaces , therefore the corresponding @xmath249-algebras are nonunital .",
    "thanks to the gelfand - naimark theorem , the entire topological information on the spaces is coded in the algebraic properties of commutative @xmath249-algebras , to which they are dual .",
    "relaxing the commutativity property on the @xmath249-algebras locates us then in the field of noncommutative topology .",
    "the subject of its study is not some kind of noncommutative spaces , but rather algebras of ( continuous ) functions on them .",
    "these `` functions '' are actually operators , and the @xmath249-algebras are algebras of operators acting in appropriate hilbert spaces , in general infinite dimensional .",
    "this statement is the content of a second theorem by gelfand and naimark .",
    "( on gelfand - naimark theorems one can consult for example the recent book @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that coordinates of the virtual noncommutative spaces are not commuting , and the possibility to realize the algebras of `` functions '' on them as algebras of operators in a hilbert space , inspired the creators and developers of this area of mathematics to adopt physicists terminology and to speak about quantum geometry or quantum topology ( the latter name in the case of strictly limiting to the @xmath249-algebras seems more appropriate ) and about quantum spaces .",
    "in contrast to topologists , geometers usually prefer to speak about smooth manifolds rather than topological spaces .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath249-algebras noncommutative geometry studies @xmath250-algebras that are dense in appropriate @xmath249-algebras exactly in the manner in which algebras of smooth complex valued functions on manifolds are dense in corresponding algebras of continuous functions .",
    "the conditions lead to the notion of a pre-@xmath249-algebra .",
    "the noncommutative torus is a quantum space , which might be described using either @xmath249-algebraic or @xmath250-algebraic language , with appropriate limits in the latter case locating us in the @xmath249-algebraic framework .",
    "let us shortly review , following @xcite , @xcite the @xmath250-algebraic approach to the noncommutative torus .",
    "the algebra @xmath251 of smooth `` functions '' on the noncommutative torus @xmath252 is the unital @xmath250-algebra generated by 2 indeterminates @xmath253 , @xmath254 with the relation @xmath255 the @xmath250 structure is defined by imposing unitarity on @xmath253 , @xmath254 , by @xmath256 , @xmath257 .",
    "a generic element @xmath258 is then of the form @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is a complex valued schwarz function on @xmath261 , i.e. a sequence of complex numbers @xmath262 , which decreases rapidly at infinity ( @xmath263 ) .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case , in which @xmath264 is rational , @xmath265 , where @xmath266 and @xmath1 are positive integers taken to be relatively prime .",
    "therefore we present further only the rational @xmath264 case . in this case",
    "@xmath267 is the algebra of smooth sections of a twisted matrix bundle over @xmath41 .",
    "let us briefly describe the construction leading to the twisted bundle following @xcite .",
    "the bundle is denoted @xmath268 , with @xmath269 .",
    "the fibers of the bundle are isomorphic with the algebra @xmath270 of all @xmath271 complex - valued matrices .",
    "its transition functions have values in @xmath272 .",
    "they act on @xmath273 by conjugation .",
    "first , we consider a trivial bundle ( we identify here and below @xmath41 with @xmath274 ) @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the natural projection on the first two members .",
    "the algebra of smooth sections of this bundle is @xmath277    the algebra @xmath278 may be understood as the unique algebra generated by 2 unitary elements @xmath279 and @xmath280 such that @xmath281    the matrices @xmath279 and @xmath280 may be represented in the form , which is very closely related to the matrices @xmath99 and @xmath282 introduced in the section 2 .",
    "here however , the parameter @xmath283 differs from the parameter @xmath284 , since @xmath285 , but @xmath286 .",
    "the algebra of smooth sections of the bundle ( [ bundle ] ) is generated by unitary commuting elements @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and by unitaries @xmath279 , @xmath280 generating @xmath289 .    in order to define the twisting of this bundle ,",
    "the following actions should be considered : the action of @xmath290 on @xmath291 , @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and the action of @xmath294 on @xmath278 , @xmath295 , @xmath293 .",
    "then , we impose the condition that the following diagram is commutative @xmath296    there is a vector bundle over @xmath291 , @xmath297 such that @xmath298 . this fact is closely related to the morita equivalence of the noncommutative torus with the commutative one .",
    "namely , morita equivalence of two @xmath249-algebras or two pre-@xmath249-algebras means that the algebras have a common module , on which one of them acts from the left and the other from the right .",
    "this is exactly the case for a noncommutative torus with rational `` deformation parameter '' and the standard commutative torus .",
    "we may treat the space of ( smooth ) sections of the bundle @xmath299 as the left module for the algebra @xmath300 , since the latter consists of endomorphisms of the former .",
    "simultaneously , since @xmath299 is a bundle over the standard torus , the pre-@xmath249-algebra of smooth functions on the torus acts on the space of smooth sections of @xmath301 from the right .",
    "this is the way in which the rational noncommutative tori are related via morita equivalence with the commutative torus .",
    "however , the morita equivalence of the two kind of spaces , although very important , is not directly responsible for the convergence effects we studied in the body of this paper . in the geometric picture",
    "the limiting procedure may be described in the following way : the algebra @xmath273 , which is isomorphic with the fibers of the bundle @xmath302 may be undestood as the lie algebra @xmath12 . from this moment on one should just remind the construction described in the body of the paper .",
