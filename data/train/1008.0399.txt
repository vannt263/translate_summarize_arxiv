    ", we can suppose that mergers of galaxies can lead to the formation of the massive black holes ( mbh ) observed in galaxies and their binary systems .",
    "thus , the main goal of this work is to describe a method to determine the evolution of binary systems of massive black holes in the hierarchical scenario . to do that , we present in sec .",
    "2 a short review on the press?schechter formalism . in sec .",

    "our models are obtained using the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the hierarchical scenario of structure formation : the core of press - schechter @xcite ( p - s ) .",
    "formalism is that a dark matter halo leaves the linear regime when the mean density within a given volume is larger than a threshold level @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , lacey and cole @xcite proposed an extension of the p - s formalism based on the brownian random wake of bond et al.@xcite .",
    "the goal of this extension was to take into account the probability that a dark matter halo ( henceforth halo ) , with mass @xmath5 , has to merger with another halo with mass @xmath6 , for any redshift z , in order to form a new halo with mass @xmath7 .",
    "fakhouri and ma@xcite showed that , using the p - s formalism and its extension , the merger rate of haloes is given by : @xmath8^{-3/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the p - s mass function of dark haloes , @xmath10 is the variance and @xmath11 is the merger of dark halos .",
    "wythe & loeb@xcite proposed a model for the relation between central black hole and the mass of host dark halo .",
    "the authors consider that the central black hole ( cbh ) stop growing when the accretion reaches the eddington luminosity .",
    "in particular , they consider that the circular velocity is equal the virial velocity , in this case , the mass of dark halo @xmath12 , as a function of the cbh is ( see refs , ):",
    "@xmath13    where @xmath14 is the dark matter parameter at present time , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the linear overdensity by virialization of a spherical pertubation `` _ _ top - hat__''-like , that for @xmath17cdm is@xcite : @xmath18 -39[\\omega_{m}(z ) - 1]^{2}.\\ ] ]    if we consider that the fraction @xmath19 of dark haloes , at @xmath20 , having a central mbh , then we can obtain , using equations ( [ mhalo0 ] ) and ( [ tfu ] ) , the following equation to the formation rate of massive binary systems : @xmath21    where @xmath22 @xmath23 is the mass of cbh , @xmath24 is the separation of binary system at @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the separation distribution function .",
    "we considered in eq .",
    "( [ bfr ] ) that the central mbh quickly forms binary systems and which the fraction @xmath27 of these systems achieve the gravitational wave regime .",
    "on the other hand , for the separation distribution function we have : @xcite : @xmath28\\frac{da}{a}.\\ ] ] in the above equation we consider that the mbhs are formed in galaxy clusters .",
    "thus , @xmath29 represents the maximum separation of the components , and @xmath30 is the typical dimension of galaxies clusters .",
    "the density number ( @xmath31 ) of black hole binary systems obeys the conservation equation : @xmath32    in a gravitational wave regime , the variation of separation with time is : @xmath33    finally , the number of systems , as a function of @xmath25 and observed frequency , @xmath34 , is : @xmath35    with : @xmath36^{1/2}a^{-5/2}(1+z)\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the comovel volume .",
    "in this work , we use the lax - wendroff schema@xcite to obtain the numerical solution of equation ( [ dnsy ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] , on the left hand side , shows the number of systems , by frequency by redshift , of binary system formed by black holes of mass @xmath38 and @xmath39 and , on the right hand side , the total number of systems into the mass range @xmath40 and @xmath41 for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath27.in both cases , we assumed that the separation range is @xmath42 , with @xmath43 is the schwardschild ratio of black hole @xmath44 and we assumed @xmath45 . note that the function @xmath46 peaks at @xmath47 .     and black holes with mass @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "in the right hand right , is presented the total number of binary sistems of massive black holes into the mass range @xmath40 and @xmath41 . on the top",
    "it was assumed @xmath50 and on the botton it was considered @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . ,",
    "we presented a different method to calculate the number of binary systems of mas- sive black holes using the press - schechter formalism .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the total number of systems obtained here takes into account all systems .",
    "this is a different result when compared , for example , for the work of wythe & loeb @xcite who obtained their results only for systems within the lisa range .",
    "the numeri- cal method used here is stable and it produces a smooth function for the density of binary systems .",
