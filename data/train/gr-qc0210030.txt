    "the differences in @xmath6 , which do not affect the keplerian periods and the post - newtonian gravitoelectric correction , would have , instead , an impact on the classical perturbative terms which can not be neglected .    in general , the difference between the mean longitude periods of the two counter - rotating satellites can be written as p_l = p^(0)+p_l^class+p_l^(ge ) + p_l^(gm).over many orbital revolutions , say @xmath60 , the accuracy in determining the gravitomagnetic time shift becomes + + + , where @xmath61 is the experimental error in the difference of the obtained @xmath62 over @xmath60 revolutions . after a sufficiently high number of orbital revolutions it should be possible to make the term @xmath63 smaller than @xmath64 . in order to get an estimate ,",

    "since the accuracy with which the orientation of the axes of the international terrestrial reference system ( itrs ) is of the order of 3 mas , after 300 orbital revolutions or 140 days , the gravitomagnetic time shift would reach this sensitivity cutoff .",

    "the grace twins revolve in the same sense .    in regard to @xmath87 , thinking about a pair of completely passive , spherical lageos  like satellites , it should be pointed out that for orbits with @xmath88 , for which holds , many non  gravitational perturbations affecting the semimajor axis vanish ; the remaining ones could be strongly constrained by constructing the two satellites very carefully with regard to their geometrical and physical properties .",

    "the nominal poynting - robertson effect on the semimajor axis of a circular , equatorial orbit ( @xmath65 km ) is of the order of @xmath86 cm over one orbital revolution .",
    "however , it is linearly proportional to the satellite reflectivity coefficient @xmath100 for which a 0.51@xmath27 mismodelling can be assumed .",
    "the semimajor axis of a circular orbit is neither affected neither the albedo over one orbital revolution .",

    "it is not a too stringent constraint . for lageos , which is completely passive , the largest non  gravitational acceleration ,",
    "i.e. the direct solar radiation pressure , amounts to almost @xmath197 cm s@xmath3 ; a drag - free apparatus with not too stringent performances  well far from the @xmath198 cm s@xmath3 hz@xmath10 level of lisa  could meet in a relatively easy way such requirement . for @xmath199 cm ,",
    "@xmath78 @xmath79 s@xmath3 and @xmath200 cm s@xmath3 it turns out _ d&= & 14()^ a_r(d)=110 ^ -12  s , + _ r_0&= & 35d ( ) ^ a_r(r_0)=510 ^ -16  s , + _ gm&= & 21d ( ) ^ a_r(gm)=110 ^ -15  s. these results show that the direct impact of the non - gravitational accelerations on the measurement of the gravitomagnetic time shift on @xmath0 could be made negligible with a drag - free apparatus of relatively modest performances , contrary to the indirect effects on the difference of the keplerian periods which , as seen before , would require a much more effective drag  free cancellation in the frequency range @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "in this paper we have examined the possibility of measuring the gravitomagnetic clock effect on the mean longitudes of a pair of counter - rotating satellites following almost identical circular equatorial orbits in the gravitational field of earth . while the gravitomagnetic signature depends only on the earth parameters , the aliasing classical effects depend also on the orbital geometry of the satellites , so that it is possible to choose it suitably in order to reduce their impact on the measurement of the post - newtonian effect . in this respect ,",
    "our choice of a nominal value of 25498 km for the semimajor axis yields good results .    from the point of view of the observational accuracy , one source of error",
    "would be the uncertainty with which the axes of the itrs are known .",
    "however , it turns out that the level of the gravitomagnetic effect can be reached over a sufficiently high number of orbital revolutions .    in regard to the systematic errors , the major limiting factors are    * the unavoidable imperfect cancellation of the keplerian periods , which yields a 10@xmath3 cm constraint in knowing the difference @xmath59 between the semimajor axes of the satellites * the required accuracy in the knowledge of the inclinations @xmath6 of the satellites in presence of not exactly equatorial orbits . for @xmath168",
    "the difference between the inclinations of the two orbital planes @xmath202 should be less than 0.006@xmath203 .",
    "a pair of drag - free ( @xmath204 cm s@xmath3 hz@xmath10 ) spacecraft endowed with an intersatellite tracking apparatus might allow to meet the stringent requirements of such a mission whose realization seems to be very difficult although , perhaps , not completely impossible with the present - day or forthcoming space technologies .",
