    "in spintronics , one of the most important variables is spin current which describes the propagation of angular momentum information through magnetic and non - magnetic media @xcite .",
    "there are a number of different carriers that contribute to spin current . in non - magnetic metals ,",
    "the carriers are conduction electrons while for magnetic insulators , the angular momentum carriers are magnons or spin waves . when these different carriers meet at interfaces , they transfer the angular momentum via interfacial exchange interaction .",
    "for example , the spin pumping describes a precessing ferromagnet transferring its long wavelength magnon current to an electron spin current in the adjacent metallic layer @xcite , and the spin seebeck effect addresses the spatially non - uniform thermal magnon diffusion @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have shown that angular momentum current transfer at interfaces is a general phenomenon for many combinations of materials as long as the low - energy carriers ( quasi - particles or order parameters ) of the materials have nonzero angular momentum @xcite . in a trilayer made of a ferromagnetic insulator ( fi ) layer ( yig ) sandwiched between two non - magnetic metallic layers ( pt ) , it has been observed that a charge current applied in one of the metal layers can result in a charge current in the other layer via magnon - mediated spin current propagation @xcite . the observed signal is much more profound at high temperature , indicating that a simple model based on a temperature independent interfacial mixing conductance would fail to describe the experimental findings @xcite .",
    "other recent experiments demonstrated that the spin current can flow from a ferromagnetic insulator to a non - magnetic metallic ( nm ) layer with a thin antiferromagnetic insulator ( afi ) in between @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spin propagation efficiency is much enhanced at high temperature when compared with the device without the afi layer @xcite .",
    "these findings call for a more comprehensive theoretical model which is capable of addressing the angular momentum current across interfaces between different materials at finite temperature",
    ".    there are a number of existing theoretical models for the spin conductance ( sc ) near interfaces . in spin",
    "pumping , the sc or mixing conductance between a ferromagnetic layer and non - magnetic metallic layer has been calculated at zero temperature using first principle methods @xcite . in spin seebeck effect",
    ", the sc between the fi and nm layers has been studied by model hamiltonians and the resulting sc is highly temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "thus , the spin conductances for the thermally driven spin seebeck effect and for the spin pumping are quite different even though the interface is identically same .",
    "there are also theoretical studies involving afi layer .",
    "_ calculated the spin current due to a temperature difference across the afi and nm interface @xcite .",
    "studied spin pumping from an afi layer to a nm layer @xcite . recently ,",
    "introduced a mixing conductance for the interfaces between fi and afi layers phenomenologically without calculating its temperature or material dependence @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a theory to formulate the sc for interfaces with different material combinations by using a generic interface exchange hamiltonian , with an emphasis on the temperature dependence of the sc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the concept of spin battery for three different spin current generators , define the interface sc , and summarize our results for various interface scs in table i. in sec .",
    "iii , we provide detailed models and calculations to support the results in table i. in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the above scs to the fi / afi / nm trilayers and compare our results to available experiments . the excellent agreement with the experimental data",
    "are obtained .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "the interface sc is defined as the ratio of the spin or angular momentum current across the interface to the spin voltage drop at the two sides of the interface .",
    "the spin voltage is provided by a spin battery .",
    "followed the three spin current generators introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the spin battery voltage in each case before calculating the sc .    first , the spin voltage of the `` spin pumping battery '' @xcite , which is generated by an external microwave source such that the magnetization of ferromagnetic layer undergoes precession motion in the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) condition , can be defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dimensionless unit vector representing the direction of the magnetization of the layer .",
    "it is understood that the spin pumping battery provides non - equilibrium magnons with zero wave number ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the second spin battery is created by a temperature gradient across a fi layer @xcite .",
    "the presence of the position - dependent temperature @xmath3 in the fi layer ( @xmath4 ) leads to a non - uniform local magnon density @xmath5 where @xmath6^{-1 } $ ] is the bose - einstein distribution function and @xmath7 is the fi magnon density of states .",
    "the magnon diffusion generates a magnon current in the fi layer .",
    "when the magnon current flows to the interface , a non - equilibrium magnon density is accumulated near the interface . these non - equilibrium magnon accumulation becomes a spin voltage that can excite spin degree of freedom at the other side of the interface . in the open circuit condition ( i.e. , an isolated fi layer without a contacting layer ) , the magnon accumulation is proportional to the magnon diffusion length .",
    "thus , we define the thermally driven spin battery voltage as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath10 is the magnon diffusion length within the fi layer .",
    "the third battery is built up in a non - magnetic layer such as pt with a large spin hall angle .",
    "when an in - plane current is applied to the nm layer , a spin hall current flowing perpendicular to the charge current is generated .",
    "similar to the magnon accumulation for magnetic materials , electron spin accumulation is built near the interface and scales with the spin diffusion length in the open circuit condition @xcite .",
    "the spin hall battery voltage in this case is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electron charge , @xmath13 is the spin hall angle , @xmath14 is the spin diffusion length within the nm material , @xmath15 is the resistivity , @xmath16 is the unit vector normal to the interface , and @xmath17 is the electron current density .",
    "we emphasize a few points on the above definitions : 1 ) we have chosen the unit of the spin battery to be that of energy , 2 ) the spin battery is a vector which characterizes the direction of the angular momentum ( note that the spin pumping battery is transverse to @xmath1 and the temperature gradient battery is parallel to @xmath1 ) , 3 ) the battery `` stores '' different forms of spin angular momenta : zero - wave number magnons for spin pumping battery , magnon accumulation with a broad distribution of wave numbers for the thermal battery , and electron spin accumulation for the spin hall battery .",
    "these spin batteries , in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , are defined for an isolated layer , i.e , in the absence of spin current . when the battery is connected to a layer which is capable of carrying spin momenta , a spin current flows in the neighboring layer as well as in the battery layer .",
    "thus , both internal spin current ( within the battery layer ) and external spin current will  consume \" spin angular momentum .",
    "however , the comparison between charge and spin batteries on the internal and external resistance or conductance shows one fundamental difference : the electric current is conserved but the spin current is not , thus the addition of the resistance in series is no longer valid for the spin resistance @xcite ; we shall illustrate in later sections on how to calculate the spin current with many layers or many spin conductors in series .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to calculate the sc at finite temperatures , for interfaces between different materials and for three different batteries .",
    "we shall first tabulate our calculated results in table i. the explanation of the table i is given below and the detailed derivation of these results will be given in the next section .",

    "the battery is the nm layer and we consider nm / fi and nm / afi interfaces . in all bilayers",
    ", the total spin current also depends on the backflow @xcite : when the battery generates a spin current in the neighboring layer , a spin or magnon accumulation will be established in the layer , which in turn , flows a portion of the spin current back to the battery , resulting a smaller interface spin current .",
    "the backflow parameter , @xmath35 , is determined by the ratio of the spin conductance at the interface to that in the layers . in a bilayer structure ,",
    "the backflow parameter for three batteries has the same form , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spin conductance of the left / right layer , see next section for details .    for spin pumping at fi / nm interfaces , the angular momentum current conversion occurs between the zero wave number magnons in the fi layer and the conduction electron spins in the nm layer @xcite .",
    "the spin conductance in this case has been identified as the mixing conductance .",
    "the temperature dependence is unimportant since the conduction electron distribution is weakly dependent on temperature . for other interfaces ,",
    "i.e. , fi / afi , the spin conductance involves conversion from fi magnons to afi magnons with broadly distributed wave numbers .",
    "since the density of the magnons is highly temperature dependent , one expects a similar dependence for the sc .",
    "the sc in table i is for low temperatures ( lower than nel or curie temperatures ) where the temperature dependence can be analytically derived . for higher temperatures ,",
    "analytical expressions are unavailable ; we will present the numerical results in later sections .",
    "the spin conductances for the temperature gradient battery are shown with the same two interfaces , fi / nm and fi / afi . in both cases , there are strong temperature dependence .",
    "spin conductance for the spin hall battery is also summarized .",
    "it is interesting to note that the electron spin current from the spin hall battery can excite two types of magnons : coherent zero wave number magnons which represent the uniform magnetization precession or spin transfer torque ( @xmath38 ) , and incoherent magnons that produce a dc magnon current ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) . when driven by the spin hall effect , the interface spin conductance is either same as the spin pumping conductance or the thermal conductance depending on the relative direction between the electron spin accumulation and the magnetization",
    ". we will further discuss these in next section .",
    "it is noted that the magnetic metal is not included in this paper because of an additional complication : a magnetic metal has both magnons and conduction electron spins , and thus spin current in different layers will involve much more channels ; we will leave such complication for further studies .",
    "in this section , we derive the conductances shown in table i. we start with specifying the model hamiltonian for each layer and determining the dispersion relations of equilibrium quasi - particles including the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic magnons . by using a generic exchange coupling between spins of the two layers at the interface , we compute the interface spin conductance and total spin current include backflow .",
    "we first consider simple models for each individual layer . for nonmagnetic metals , the spin current carriers are conduction electrons whose",
    "dispersion relations are described by free electron model , i.e. , @xmath41 . for fi or afi",

    "@xmath53 is the fi magnon gap .    with the positive sign",
    ", the hamiltonian describes an antiferromagnetic lattice . within the spin wave approximation ,",
    "the magnon spectra are @xmath54 where @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56 represent two branches of magnon and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 is the afi magnon gap .     and afi sublattice @xmath59 , respectively.,width=453 ]    there are two important distinctions between the fi and afi magnons .",
    "first , the fi magnon has a small energy gap determined by the anisotropy while the afi magnon has a much larger gap because it scales with the geometrical average of the exchange constant and the anisotropy .",
    "another distinction is that each f magnon carries an angular momentum @xmath60 with respect to the magnetization direction while in the af lattice , a magnon in one branch ( @xmath61 ) carries @xmath60 and the other ( @xmath62 ) carries @xmath63 . in fig . 1 , we depict spin configuration of a fi magnon and a afi magnon in each of the two branches .",
    "a @xmath55 magnon represents the mode with a larger precession angle for sublattice @xmath64 ( red ) than @xmath59 ( blue ) , i.e. , @xmath65 . while both @xmath66 and @xmath67 depend on @xmath68 , the angular momentum is @xmath69 \\equiv - \\hbar$ ] for a @xmath70 magnon and @xmath71 for a @xmath72 magnon , where @xmath73 is the number of spins in the afi lattice . in the absence of the external magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 magnons have exactly same energy , indicating that these two degenerate magnon branches are equally populated at any temperature , and thus there is no net magnetization or spin current at equilibrium .",
    "having specified the angular momentum carriers in each layer , we now introduce the spin interaction between two materials in contact .",
    "a generic exchange interaction at the interface between two spins would be simplest and universal , @xmath74 where @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) represents the spin at the interface of the left ( right ) layer .",
    "for the fi or afi layers , @xmath77 refers to the spin at the local site , while for the nm , @xmath77 denotes the spin of conduction electrons at the interface .",

    "the magnons and electrons can be described by the boson and fermion statistics .    for the spin pumping voltage",

    "have already derived the sc using similar method , but expressed the result in terms of ferromagnetic susceptibility @xcite . by replacing the susceptibility with the lindhard susceptibility of a non - magnetic metal",
    ", one will directly get the mixing conductance derived here .",
    "next , we calculate the spin pumping conductance for a fi / afi interface .",
    "the second quantization of @xmath18 in eq .",

    "the lowest order terms refer to two magnon interactions .",
    "the angular momentum conservation limits the possible two - magnons processes to @xmath102 and its complex conjugate .",
    "however , such process is prohibited by the energy conservation : the energy of the fmr frequency or @xmath90 magnon is too small to excite any magnon in the afi .",
    "thus , the angular momentum current across the interface must go through at least four magnon processes . by expanding eq .",
    "( 7 ) to four magnon operators , we obtain a number of terms which satisfy both energy and angular momentum conservation . for example , the term @xmath103 represents the transfer of the angular momentum in the fi by annihilating a @xmath90 and two thermal magnon of the fi layer , and simultaneously annihilating a @xmath72 magnon in the afi layer , as long as @xmath104 . after tedious but straightforward calculations ,",

    "notice that the interaction in eq .",
    "( 7 ) also contains other four magnon terms involving three afi magnons and one @xmath90 fi magnon like @xmath118 and so on .",
    "below the nel temperature , the spin pumping conductance from those terms can be estimated as @xmath119 .",
    "the total spin pumping conductance is the sum of all these contributions .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , the total spin current depends on the backflow .",
    "the backflow can be easily included if the layer thickness is much larger than the relevant length scales such as the spin or magnon diffusion lengths .",
    "the spin current provided by the spin battery decays in the layer ; this creates a spin accumulation or magnon accumulation that drive a backflow spin current .",
    "one may introduce a spin conductance @xmath120 as the spin conductance for the nm layer and similarly , @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the fi and afi layers .",
    "the onsager reciprocal relation can be used to determine the backflow current @xcite such that the total spin current across the interface is reduced by @xmath123 where the backflow factor @xmath124 .",
    "we will discuss the relative magnitudes of these scs when we apply our theory to a concrete multilayer .",
    "the spin seebeck current across a fi / nm bilayer has been theoretically studied based on the diffusion theory of thermal magnons @xcite .",
    "far from the interface , the temperature gradient perpendicular to the interface drives a magnon current .",

    ", there is a broad magnon spectrum distribution . for the fi / nm interface ,",
    "the interaction in the spin wave approximation is same as eq .",
    "( 8) and the expression of eq .",
    "( 10 ) remains valid .",
    "however , we need to replace the magnon distribution by , @xmath125 where we have introduced the spatial dependent magnon chemical potential , @xmath126 . at equilibrium",

    "if the temperature is lower than the curie temperature of the fi , the sc reduces to a simple @xmath134 power law listed in table i. the inclusion of the backflow can be similarly done ; the calculated backflow parameter @xmath35 has same forms as that of the spin pumping , with one distinction : in the present case , @xmath121 is the spin conductance for the longitudinal spin current ( proportional to the magnon - diffusion length ) , while @xmath121 in the spin pumping battery is for the transverse spin current where the spin dephasing length is much smaller .",
    "the second interface for the thermally driven spin battery is the fi / afi interface in which the thermal magnons in the fi transfer to the magnons in the afi layer .",
    "in contrast to the spin pumping battery where the two magnon process is prohibited , the thermal magnons have a broad spectrum of the magnon energy in the fi layer and thus it is possible to directly transfer one fi magnon to one afi magnon , i.e. , the interface spin exchange interaction in the form of @xmath135 leads to a spin current across the interface , @xmath136 \\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\rm f } - \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{q}'}^{\\alpha})\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath137 are the fi and afi magnon distribution functions respectively .",

    "the spin battery is the magnon accumulation with broad wave number distribution , and the interface spin conductance is given by @xmath178 .",
    "again , the spin pumping current vanishes at low temperature , reflecting the fact that magnon or spin current is blocked by either the fi / afi or afi / nm interface at low temperatures .",
    "the spin current enhancement with the afi layer is , @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "as our theory is built on the spin wave approximation , one would expect the theory not applicable to high temperatures , in particular , near the transition temperature",
    ". however , the most interesting features with the afi layers discovered experimentally occur at a temperature near or even above the nel temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , it is desirable to extend the formalism with reasonably approximations .",
    ", as a function of temperature for various spin conductance of the nm layer from @xmath181 @xmath182 , calculated by using eq .",
    "the parameters are @xmath183 nm , @xmath184 nm , @xmath185 k , @xmath186 k ( @xmath187 nm ) , @xmath188 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 ev .",
    "@xmath191 0.07 ev and @xmath192 ev are the @xmath193 constant at the interface .",
    "( a ) the enhancement factor for a number of spin conductance of the nm layer .",
    "( b ) comparison of the experimental points @xcite with the theoretical curve for @xmath194 .",
    ", width=566 ]    the spin transport near transition temperatures is in general an unresolved theoretical issue .",
    "while there are a number of approximate methods to treat the critical phenomena , no rigorous theory exists for a wide range of temperatures . here we should remain to use the spin wave approximation with one limitation : above the transition temperature , the spin wave approximation breaks down since spin correlation length becomes finite . in early theories and neutron scattering experiments , it was indeed found that the spin wave with long wavelengths loses its meaning , but the short wavelength magnon remains intact @xcite .",
    "for example , the spin correlation length of nio is @xmath195 where @xmath196 , @xmath197 nm is the lattice constant of nio and @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "the magnon whose wavelength is shorter than @xmath199 has well - defined dispersion relation @xcite , indicating the presence of short - range af spin correlations .",
    "we thus modify our spin wave approximation by assuming a cutoff energy @xmath200 where @xmath201 such that @xmath202 for @xmath203 .",
    "when the temperature increases , the long wavelength magnons do not participate transport . with this modification , we are able to address the spin current propagation for a wide range of temperatures .    as an example , we consider the same fi / afi / nm ( yig / nio / pt ) trilayer . at high temperatures ,",
    "we no longer use table i for the interface sc . instead",
    ", we will use the general expression , eqs . (",
    "18 ) and ( 24 ) by placing the cutoff energy as a lower bound of the integration . in fig.2(a ) , we show the spin current enhancement as a function of the temperature for a thermal battery for different nm spin conductance . as the temperature increases , the number of magnons and the interface conductance increase , thus the spin current , mediated by the magnons in the afi layer increases .",
    "when the temperature reaches to the nel temperature of the afi ( note that the curie temperature of yig is much higher ) , the number of magnons participating the angular momentum transport begins to decrease due to removing of the long wavelength magnons .",
    "meanwhile , the spin current in the bilayer structure keeps increasing with temperature when @xmath204 .",
    "thus , both the spin conductance @xmath205 and the enhancement factor @xmath206 are maximum near the nel temperature .",
    "we notice that spin current peak at the transition temperature has been obtained by okamoto by using a different approach @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is reduced as the nm layer sc decreases due to enhanced back flow , consistent with eq .",
    "interestingly , the peak position occurs at a lower temperature for smaller sc of the nm layer ; this can be explained as follows . when @xmath205 becomes larger than @xmath207 , the spin current in the yig / nio / pt trilayer saturates , while for the yig / pt bilayer , spin current continues to increase with temperature since @xmath208 remains smaller than @xmath207 .",
    "notice that the calculated @xmath206 deviates the @xmath209 law even at low temperatures due to the large af magnon gap . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we compare our calculations with @xmath207 measured in previous publication @xcite ; the agreement is considered to be excellent @xcite .",
    "we have developed a theory based on spin current transfer at interfaces .",
    "the different spin current carriers are mutually converting via an interfacial spin exchange hamiltonian . within the spin wave approximation , we are able to explicitly formulate the sc for different sources of the spin current ( spin batteries ) and for different interfaces at finite temperature .",
    "we point out that the sc studied here is for quasi - particle spin transport , i.e. , the spin current carriers are incoherent low - energy quasiparticles , which is different from the `` super - current '' carried by the macroscopic classical magnetization ( coherent magnons ) , or the order parameter . for the quasiparticle transport ,",
    "the quantum statistics governs the temperature dependent properties . in general ,",
    "both incoherent and coherent magnons contribute to the spin transport .",
    "our theory is particularly effective to be used for multilayered structure at finite temperature with arbitrary layer thickness . using the diffusion equation for each layer along with the interface scs ,",
    "one is able to determine the spatial and temperature dependence of the spin current .",
    "the spin battery , which is an extension of the spin pumping battery introduced earlier @xcite , is a convenient concept that can be used to describe the spin current flow . in analogy with an electric battery : the spin battery has just one terminal while the electrical battery must have at least two terminals because of the conservation law imposed to the charge current . for the spin battery ,",
    "one can still use spin ohm s law , i.e. , @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a local spin resistivity . due to non - conservative nature of the spin current ,",
    "the spin current @xmath212 is no longer a constant throughout the layers .",
    "thus , the spin ohm s law alone ( even if @xmath213 is known ) can not determine the spin current .",
    "in this paper , we have provided a general scheme for computing the spin current .",
    "our theory provides a natural explanation to the temperature dependence of current propagation through fi and afi insulators .",
    "recent experiments on pt / yig / pt have confirmed our earlier prediction @xcite .",
    "the spin current enhancement by inserting a thin nio layer at the interface of the yig / nm @xcite , quantitatively supports our theory .",
    "the other theories based on the order parameter spin transport @xcite have not taken into account finite temperature effects .",
