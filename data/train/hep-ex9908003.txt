    "the first hera measurements of the charm contribution to the proton structure function , were reported by the h1 and zeus collaborations from an analysis of production in their 1994 data sets @xcite .",
    "the results were consistent with photon gluon fusion ( pgf ) being the dominant mechanism for  production in @xmath0 deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "if this is the case , this type of measurements are sensitive to the gluons in the proton . in addition",
    ", they can provide a test of the universality of the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , namely , whether pdf s extracted from the inclusive measurement of the proton structure function , , can be used as input for calculations of more exclusive processes as charm production .    here",
    "we present a study of  production using the 1996 and 1997 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37 .",
    "more than tenfold larger data sample , together with the modifications of the zeus detector made for the 1996 and 1997 operation allow an extension of the kinematic range to both smaller and larger .",

    "the results using each decay channel can be directly compared in the  differential cross section .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "we compute nlo qcd calculations with a semi - inclusive monte carlo generator hvqdis@xcite for heavy quark production and subsequent fragmentation to  via a peterson fragmentation function  @xcite .",
    "this generator is based on nlo calculations  @xcite in the three flavor number scheme ( tfns ) , in which only light quarks ( @xmath23 ) are included in the initial state proton .",

    "carlo fragmentation models like jetset or herwig , a forward shift in the  direction w.r.t . that of the original charm quark is produced during the fragmentation due to the interaction of the charm quark with the proton remnant via either strings or soft gluon radiatio    to investigate how this affects the nlo qcd predictions we have reweighted a lo monte carlo for charm production , rapgap ( it uses jetset for the fragmentation ) in a way such that at the stage of the hard interaction it will reproduce exactly the hvqdis results for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 differential cross sections .",
    "the predictions from this nlo reweighted rapgap monte carlo are shown in ( figure  [ diffxsections ] ) .",
    "they provide a better descripion of the data , especially in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 differential cross sections this result suggest that the small disagreement found with hvqdis come from the fact that the peterson function can not account for all the charm quark fragmentation effects present at hera , in particular the interaction with the remnant .",
    "the procedure for extracting   starts by measuring the  production cross section in the restricted ,  region in bins of  and @xmath33 .",
    "the extrapolation to the full ,   region is done in the following way : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the center of gravity of the bin @xmath37 and ` m ' and ` t ' denote ` measured ' and ` theoretical ' respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is taken from zeus94  @xcite fit .",
    "for @xmath39 we use the reweighted monte carlo .",
    "a number of assumptions are implicitly done in this procedure :    * the tfns is valid , * @xmath40 is negligible(@xmath41 of  in our @xmath42 , @xmath33 region from calculations based on  @xcite ) , * the value of @xmath43 measured in @xmath26 is valid also at hera , * the cross section outside the restricted region is well described by nlo qcd .",
