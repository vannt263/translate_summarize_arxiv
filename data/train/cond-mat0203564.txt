    "since the seventies @xcite , it is well established that at low temperature @xmath9 , the properties of amorphous solids differ strongly from their crystaline counterparts .",
    "this is currently explained @xcite within the tunneling two - level system ( tls ) model , stating that the only relevant degrees of freedom at low @xmath9 are particles going back and forth between two neighboring sites of equilibrium . indeed , the tls model accounts for various properties of glasses below @xmath10 @xmath11 . a closer look , however , reveals that the tls model often does not quantitatively account for the measured quantities . since the late eighties , considerable efforts have been made to include interactions between tls s in order to explain such discrepancies @xcite and justify the tls model from first principles @xcite , @xcite or , at least , to give a more consistent picture of tls s @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of tls microscopic information allowed to consider interactions either to be weak @xcite or strong @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : these opposite starting points echo leggett and yu s question : `` is there anything really tunneling in glasses ? ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to gain some microscopic information on tls s by studying the magnetic field effect on a glassy property , namely the @xmath12 @xmath13 dielectric constant @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , for a charge @xmath14 , the tunneling transparency of a barrier of size @xmath15 is strongly modified by magnetic fields @xmath5 of the order of @xmath16 : this is due to the ( @xmath5 dependent ) difference of quantum phase picked up by the various paths under the barrier @xcite . however , setting the usual tls parameters , @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the electronic charge , leads to @xmath21 @xmath7 , a value so large that it seemed to explain frossati _",
    "et al _ s results @xcite reporting no detectable @xmath5 effects on @xmath8 .",
    "recently , however , detectable @xmath0 effects were reported below @xmath22 @xmath3 ( and down to @xmath12 @xmath3 ) on a multicomponent glass @xcite , @xcite . very strikingly , @xmath0 is peaked around @xmath23 @xmath7 , a very low value accounted for by using interactions : at low @xmath9 , it was argued that interactions correlate a large number @xmath24 of tls s and that the resulting spectrum resembles that of a single tls with a charge @xmath25 ( and a renormalized tunneling energy @xmath26 ) . in this work , a detectable @xmath0 effect is reported on a @xmath1 glass for @xmath4 @xmath27 @xmath3 and @xmath5 up to @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "even if our glass is not really a model glass ( such as the various forms of vitreous silica , e.g. suprasil ) , the @xmath0 dependence reported here shows that these effects are not restricted to the multicomponent glass studied previously @xcite , @xcite , favoring the idea that such effects are general in structural glasses .",
    "furthermore our work shows , as stated previously @xcite , that such measurements demand special experimental care since @xmath0 effects are quite small : @xmath28 lies typically in the @xmath29 range ( @xmath30 is the real part of @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is why , after a brief description of the experimental setup , it is explained how to overcome the difficult question of keeping @xmath9 constant with great accuracy , while increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 effect is then accounted for by using numerical calculations of the @xmath5 effect on the tunneling transparency of a _ disordered _ nanometric barrier . as explained below",
    ", this additional mechanism should not contradict the one based upon interactions .",
    "the sample was deposited on a @xmath32 substrate as follows : i ) a @xmath33 @xmath34 thick cu layer was first evaporated , ii ) a @xmath35 @xmath34 thick @xmath1 layer was then deposited by a @xmath36 @xmath37 plasma vapor technique using tetraethylorthosilane mixed with he @xcite iii ) a @xmath38 @xmath34 thick cu layer , followed by a @xmath39 @xmath34 au layer was evaporated . both electrodes are @xmath6 @xmath40 large @xmath41 @xmath40 long ribbons recovering each other along @xmath42 @xmath40 ( i.e. , the capacitance surface is @xmath43 @xmath44 ) : the opposite ends of the electrodes are free of glass deposit allowing an ohmic contact to be made with a cu wire glued with ag paste .",
    "these two cu wires are soldered to the inner wires of cryogenic coaxial cables going from room temperature to the cold copper box embedding the sample : this box is related to the mixing chamber of the dilution fridge by a thermal impedance and contains a @xmath45 resistive thermometer whose resistance will be called @xmath46 throughout this work ( to avoid any confusion with the parallel resistance @xmath47 of the glass sample ) .",
    "the sample substrate was glued with varnish on a copper sample holder for thermalization . to decrease possible @xmath5-dependent heating in the electrodes , @xmath5",
    "was set parallel to the electrodes ( i.e. , perpendicular to the @xmath12 @xmath13 measuring field @xmath48 ) .",
    "semi - rigid home - made coaxial cables were installed at the top of the fridge and directly plugged in the andeen-2500a capacitance bridge .",
    "the capacitance bridge was used in its parallel option , yielding @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but throughout this work it was chosen to report on @xmath51 and @xmath52 due to the great similarity of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 curves ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : this strongly confirms that the reported @xmath47 at low @xmath9 is not some parasitic edge effect but has the same origin that the reported @xmath51 , namely the tls s .    from @xmath55 @xmath11 to @xmath56 @xmath11 ,",
    "the capacitance @xmath51 typically halves , while the parallel resistance @xmath47 increases by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "below @xmath56 @xmath11 , @xmath51 decreases , reaches its minimum for @xmath58 and then increases below @xmath58 before reaching a ultra low @xmath9 saturation value @xmath59 . according to the standard tls model",
    "the @xmath51 decrease above @xmath58 is due to progressive freezing of the diagonal ( or relaxational ) part of the response , while the @xmath51 increase below @xmath58 comes from the induced off - diagonal ( or resonant ) part of the susceptibility : this effect enlarges as @xmath9 decreases as do all quantum effects .",

    "the second key point to investigate small @xmath0 effects is to be able to increase @xmath5 while keeping @xmath9 accurately constant .",
    "it demands either to set up a @xmath5-independent thermometry , which is extremely difficult over an extended @xmath9 range ( it may have been the way used in @xcite , @xcite ) ; or , at least , to correct @xmath9 of the magnetoresistance of the thermometer .",
    "however , such a correction can not be done with great accuracy since the standard technique for measuring the @xmath63 dependence is as follows @xcite : _ i ) _ for @xmath77 the relationship between the power @xmath78 injected in the fridge and the resulting @xmath9 is first recorded ; _ ii ) _ for a given @xmath78 , @xmath5 is slowly raised to a given value , and the measured @xmath79 at thermal equilibrium is attributed to the magnetoresistance of the thermometer : the corresponding results are shown in the lower inset of fig . 1 and lead to corrections of the order of @xmath80 on @xmath9 when @xmath5 is raised up to a few @xmath7 .",
    "however , these @xmath63 measurements lie on the key assumption that the @xmath64 relationship does not depend at all on @xmath5 : this can not hold accurately , e.g. , due to the dissipation of energy resulting from the vibrations of the fridge within the magnetic field .",

    "last , it is shown in the section b of the appendix that spin effects , if any , can be ruled out at low enough @xmath9 , i.e. , well below @xmath58 : this is why we will focus on the positive @xmath139 observed at @xmath140 @xmath3 .",
    "for the part of the capacitance @xmath142 coming from tls s , the usual result @xcite below @xmath58 can thus be used : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is boltzmann constant , @xmath145 is the maximum interlevel spacing of tls s , and the constant @xmath146 @xmath87 is determined by fitting the increase of @xmath53 of fig . 1 below @xmath58 ( details are given below ) .",

    "this failure of the fit at low @xmath9 is due to the fact that the above expression of @xmath142 is well established only in the linear regime , and that a comprehensive treatment for the strong @xmath48 used here is still missing .",
    "however , this formula should capture the essential part of the physics since it expresses that , well below @xmath58 , the tls susceptibility is due to the quantum transitions coherently induced by @xmath48 . since , physically , it is likely that tunneling plays a key role in the nonlinear @xmath142 at low @xmath9 , eq .",

    "2 : for example at @xmath4 @xmath3 , these positive bumps around @xmath223 @xmath7 amount to @xmath224 @xmath3 and to @xmath225 @xmath3 . these two values are ten times larger than that derived from the small negative magnetoresistance of the @xmath65 thermometer ( see inset of fig . 1 ) and , even if the inset data can not be accurately trusted , these @xmath226 values are anyway too large to be entirely attributed to the @xmath45 thermometer @xcite .",
    "this means that both @xmath124 and @xmath216 are negative at @xmath4 @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath227 at @xmath4 @xmath3 and both @xmath100 and @xmath102 positive in the tesla range : with the above definition of @xmath202 , @xmath100 and @xmath102 are expected to be proportionnal to the same @xmath228 with positive coefficients . thus @xmath100 and @xmath102 _ increase _ with @xmath5 : the ( quasilinear ) decrease seen on fig .",

    "this means that @xmath245 and @xmath246 are of the same order of magnitude ( this might be seen also in @xcite ) , hence @xmath249 i.e , @xmath250 : this result holds even at large @xmath5 since @xmath106 and @xmath108 do not depend on @xmath5 .",

    "indeed , if each tls contains a single electronic spin , the non negligible zeeman energy @xmath255 @xmath256 comes into play : each tls becomes a four - level system .",
    "this complicates greatly the @xmath257 calculation in the range @xmath258 where the relaxational ( i.e. , `` thermodynamic '' ) contribution plays an important role .",
    "this is why the negative @xmath60 close to @xmath259 @xmath3 has not been interpreted and the efforts were focused on the positive @xmath60 at low @xmath9 . indeed , well below @xmath58 , the tls susceptibility is driven by the transitions _ coherently _ induced by @xmath48 , and such quantum transitions are forbidden between states of different spins : tls s can thus be separated into two _ independent _ subclasses of a given spin state whose susceptibilities can be added .",
