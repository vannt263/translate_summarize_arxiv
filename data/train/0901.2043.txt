    "the suppression of drift wave turbulence by quasi stationary zonal flows has been a major topic during the past years in magnetic fusion research .",
    "the zonal flows are poloidally and toroidally symmetric ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and radially inhomogeneous ( @xmath4 ) flow structures in toroidal plasmas  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "zonal flows are widely believed to be the main stabilizing mechanism for turbulence and one of the main keys to gain access to high confinement regimes in present and future magnetic confinement fusion devices such as iter  @xcite .",
    "the generation of zonal flows from drift wave turbulence has been extensively studied analytically  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite and in computer simulations using gyrokinetic  @xcite-  @xcite and advanced fluid models  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) driven mode is believed to be responsible for the anomalously high heat transport in fusion devices and it has been shown that it is one of the main ingredients in generation of zonal flows  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the itg mode has by now been investigated in many different contexts and situations  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic effects in perpendicular and parallel ion temperature gradient are out of the scope of the present analysis for the zonal flow generation as well as for the linear state  @xcite .",
    "the main features of the itg mode is captured by the more simple model with isotropic ion temperature and temperature gradient  @xcite .",
    "other features often found in the clm experiment , e.g impurities , do not change the itg mode qualitatively , however they may contribute though an impurity driven mode  @xcite that in turn may drive a zonal flow .",
    "it has also been show that the direct interaction of @xmath5 flows with zonal flows are rather weak  @xcite ,  @xcite .    in this particular paper both the slab like and toroidal branch of the itg mode will be considered as the generating mechanism for the zonal flow . here , the itg mode physics is based on the equations for ion continuity , ion temperature and parallel ion motion  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the system is closed by considering boltzmann distributed electrons and using the quasi neutrality condition .",
    "the secondary generated zonal flow time evolution is governed by a hasegawa - mima like equation .",
    "the zonal flow excitation is studied through coupling of coherent modes .",
    "the drift wave is considered to be a monochromatic pump wave which may couple to the zonal flow through symmetric sidebands and this gives a system of four coupled waves  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding system may be reduced to a fifth order dispersion relation for the zonal flow .",
    "it was shown in ref .",

    "@xcite simulations of itg modes in clm were performed and a good agreement between the simulations and the experiments were found on the saturation level .",
    "this particular finding validates the use of the mode coupling saturation level used in this study .",
    "however , the efforts of comparing analytical estimations with measurements are rather limited .",
    "the effects of coupling between the acoustic modes and the zonal flows are mostly unexplored as well .",
    "it has been indicated in gyrokinetic turbulence simulations that small density gradient scale lengths ( @xmath6 ) increases the transport  @xcite which encourages the present theoretical study .",
    "these issues will be discussed in the present study with an emphasis on the differences in the generation from the slab like and toroidal itg mode branch .",
    "the results are also interpreted in terms of quality of zonal flows i.e. the ratio of zonal flow growth rate and real frequency ( @xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "the toroidally driven zonal flows exhibit a much larger ratio of growth rate and frequency compared to slab like driven flows ( factor of three difference ) .",
    "the slab itg generated zonal flow is only weakly dependent on @xmath8 .",

    "the wke modeling a strongly decreasing zonal flow quality with increasing @xmath8 was found  @xcite , however in the present model the decrease of zonal flow quality is visible for larger @xmath8 .",
    "it is also important to note that the difference in quality for slab like and toroidally generated zonal flows is approximately a factor of three .",
    "it is indicated that there is a transition from a state with stationary zonal flows to a state with oscillatory zonal flows . in all parameter",
    "scalings the coherent mode coupling model agrees well with a model derived using the wke model for the same background physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the toroidal and slab itg driven modes are presented and in section iii the equations for the zonal flow are discussed .",

    "it has recently been found that magnetic shear may modify the zonal flow generation significantly for the trapped electron modes ( tem ) , however , the effects of magnetic shear on the itg mode are modest and are also out of the scope of the present paper  @xcite . in this section the linear regime of the itg mode will be discussed and the basic equations are given by ;    @xmath9 + \\left[\\phi , \\nabla^2_{\\perp } \\phi \\right ] + \\tau \\left[\\phi , \\nabla^2_{\\perp } \\left ( n + t_i\\right ) \\right ] \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}_i}{\\partial t } - \\frac{5}{3 } \\tau \\epsilon_n g \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}_i}{\\partial y } + \\left ( \\eta_i - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{\\phi}}{\\partial y } - \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{n}}{\\partial t } = \\nonumber \\\\ - \\left[\\phi , t_i \\right ] + \\frac{2}{3 } \\left[\\phi , n \\right ] \\\\",

    "the effects of parallel ion motion on the real frequency and the growth rates are small .",
    "the important differences are that the real frequencies and growth rates are significantly changed for small toroidicity and in addition the @xmath8-threshold is decreased . in this particular case",
    "it is of interest to monitor the zonal flow generation from toroidal and slab like itg mode turbulence . in the limit of small @xmath39 and small finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects",

    "the effects on the zonal flow growth rate and real frequency of toroidicity and the coupling to the acoustic modes will be investigated .",
    "there are some limitations to this derivation of the zonal flow generation namely the non - linear terms in the equation for temperature ( @xmath44 = 0 $ ] ) and in the parallel ion momentum equation are neglected ( @xmath45 = 0 $ ] ) . the procedure is to start with a monochromatic pump wave ( defined above ) that drives the zonal flow through a modulational coupling via the sidebands . the fields for the zonal flow and the sidebands are expanded as follows , @xmath46 the secondary generated zonal flow is defined as @xmath47 ( @xmath48 remembering that the zonal flow does not have a density component ) , @xmath49 are the possible sidebands ( @xmath50 ) . the radial , poloidal and parallel wave numbers are @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the complex frequency of the drift wave , @xmath53 is the radial wave number , @xmath54 is the complex frequency of the zonal flow .",
    "the frequencies couple as @xmath55 .    the equation for the time evolution for the zonal flow , that is assumed to be hasegawa - mima type ,",
    "is expanded using the above fields , @xmath56.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in addition the sidebands are to be determined .",
    "the sidebands evolve according to eq . 1 and also identify the coupling between the drift wave and the zonal flow as the sideband component .",
    "this gives a problem with four coupled waves where the zonal flow seed may be unstable and grow exponentially .",

    "<S> the role of parallel ion motion for zonal flow generation in ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) mode turbulence is investigated with focus on the effects of acoustic modes and toroidicity on the zonal flow . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason for the weak suppression of itg turbulence by zonal flows found in experiments in the columbia linear machine ( clm ) [ phys . </S>",
    "<S> plasmas * 13 * 055905 ( 2006 ) ] might be due to the small toroidicity ( @xmath0 ) in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the zonal flow is often directly dependent on the itg mode and the coupling of zonal flow to acoustic modes and hence is directly affected by any change of the relevant parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of the continuity , temperature and parallel ion momentum equations for the itg turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the zonal flow time evolution is described by a hasegawa - mima like equation and a fifth order zonal flow dispersion relation is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the results are interpreted in terms of quality of zonal flows , i.e. , the ratio of growth rate and real frequency ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the quality of the zonal flow rapidly decreases with decreasing toroidicity .    * </S>",
