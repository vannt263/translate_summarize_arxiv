    "for example , the spectral index of the x - ray background is significantly harder than the soft x - ray spectrum of bright , unobscured quasars , implying that there exists a large population of heavily - obscured agn . identifying the sources responsible for the ( hard ) x - ray background was one of the primary motivators for the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , and _",

    "furthermore , the different spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of stars and agn produces different colors for normal and active galaxies in the mid - infrared ( @xmath5 m ) . in particular , the composite black body spectra of the stellar population of normal galaxies produces an sed which peaks at approximately 1.6  @xmath1 m , while quasars have a power - law sed , @xmath6 .",
    "one of the early , traditional techniques to identify quasars relied on identifying sources with an ultraviolet excess , targeting sources whose sed does not plummet on the blue side of the stellar peak ( schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
