    "observing that a physical system is only known up to some finite precision , andronov and pontriaguyn @xcite suggested in 1937 that the study of dynamical systems should focus on stable systems , i.e. , those that do not change under small perturbations .",
    "rather strikingly , it has turned out that the topologically @xmath1-stable dynamics ( also called structurally stable systems ) can be analyzed ; indeed , they are exactly the uniformly hyperbolic systems  @xcite that satisfy an additional technical assumption . however , the structurally stable diffeomorphisms are not dense in the @xmath1-topology and therefore the study of such systems is insufficient even up to an arbitrarily small perturbation . hence , much of the focus of current research in dynamical systems is to extend our understanding beyond uniform hyperbolicity , in the hope of eventually obtaining a global theory of  most \" systems ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a natural approach is to consider weaker forms of stability .",
    "first , one should design a stability property that holds for interesting examples outside of uniform hyperbolicity .",
    "second , one should establish large sets of stable dynamics by finding robust global phenomena enforcing this property .",
    "third , if this stability fails to hold densely , one should look for robust local mechanisms responsible for its failure .",
    "the obvious candidate for such a notion is @xmath2-stability with @xmath3 , but it turns out to be very difficult to study because of a lack of perturbation lemmas . we keep the @xmath1-topology but replace topological conjugacy by a looser , entropy - based notion and realize the first step of the above program .",

    "we refer to their paper for definitions of the terms above .",
    "notice that this shows that transitivity , entropic stability and non - uniqueness of the entropy maximizing measures can robustly coexist .",
    "also , it shows that uniqueness of the entropy maximizing measure does not hold generically outside of the uniformly hyperbolic systems , even assuming topological transitivity .",
    "there are a number of natural questions that follow from theorem  [ thm : applytobv ] .",

    "does the entropy - hyperbolicity of a dominated splitting imply the finiteness of the number of entropy maximizing ergodic invariant measures ? does it implies entropic - stability ?",
    "we think that the answer to the first question above is affirmative , on the basis of partial results assuming stronger versions of the condition .",
    "entropy - hyperbolicity , as formulated above , seems to be excessively restrictive .",
    "for instance , the disjoint union of two anosov systems with distinct indices can not satisfy it for trivial reasons . also , we do not know of a system with an entropy - hyperbolic dominated splitting which is not given by an isotopy from an anosov system .",
    "the stability observed by newhouse and young and in this work , follows from a weak form of conjugacy to a uniformly hyperbolic system : almost conjugacy ( topological conjugacy up to negligible sets for the maximal entropy measure of each system ) or entropy - conjugacy ( see below def .",
    "[ def : h - conjugate ] ) .",
    "one might think that such a conjugacy is actually the rule rather than the exception .",

    "on the support of each such measure , @xmath10 is almost conjugate to some axiom a diffeomorphism .",
    "is @xmath88 residual in @xmath89 ?",
    "one can of course reformulate this question , replacing the above notion of almost conjugacy by entropy - conjugacy ( almost conjugacy does not imply and is not implied by entropy - conjugacy ) .",
    "[ q.ny ] does a generic diffeomorphism admit finitely many entropy - maximizing ergodic and invariant measures ?",
    "is it entropically stable ?    however , for all we know , entropic stability ( like structural stability ) could fail to be dense .",
    "more precisely , s. crovisier  @xcite suggested that the diffeomorphisms with homoclinic classes robustly without a dominated splitting might provide a ( large ) set of points of variation of the topological entropy and thus give a negative answer to question [ q.ny ] .",

    "<S> we analyze a class of deformations of anosov diffeomorphisms : these @xmath0-small , but @xmath1-macroscopic deformations break the topological conjugacy class but leave the high entropy dynamics unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , there is a partial conjugacy between the deformation and the original anosov system that identifies all invariant probability measures with entropy close to the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish expansiveness around those measures .    </S>",
    "<S> this class of deformations contains many of the known nonhyperbolic robustly transitive diffeomorphisms . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that it includes a class of nonpartially hyperbolic , robustly transitive diffeomorphisms described by bonatti and viana .    </S>",
