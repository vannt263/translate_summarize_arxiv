    "haploid reproduction implies that any individual has a single parent in the previous generation . since some of the individuals may have the same parent , the number of ancestors of the present population decreases going backwards in time until a complete coalescence to a single ancestor  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to construct a genealogical tree whose various branching events connect all the individuals living in the present time to the single founder ancestor .",
    "the genealogical distance between two individuals is simply the time from their last common ancestor and it may assume the maximal value only when the common ancestor coincide with the founder .",
    "+ in the limit of infinite population size , most of the quantities remain random , for example , this is the case of the probability density of genealogical distances in a single population .",
    "in fact , even in the thermodynamic limit , this quantity varies for different populations or , at different times , for the same population .",
    "the discovery of this non self - averaging behavior is due to the pioneering work of derrida , bessis , jung - muller and peliti  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if all genealogical distances among pairs of individuals are known it is possible to exactly reconstruct their genealogical tree .",
    "unfortunately , in practice , genealogical distances are unknown unless one has the relatives historical records which is not the case of living organisms populations and of most of the linguistic groups ( latin languages are an exception ) . in most cases ,",
    "only genetic distances are available .",
    "these distances , in the case of humans or other complex organisms , can be measured from the difference in mtdna ( mitochondrial dna ) , which is inherited only from the mother and , therefore , it undergoes to haploid reproduction  @xcite . in the case of languages , instead , they are deduced from lexical differences  @xcite . assuming a constant rate of mutation , these genetic distances are random and they are proportional only on average to genealogical distances .",
    "the reconstruction of the genealogical tree from the available genetic distances is forceful imprecise . in this paper",
    "we try to quantify the error one may commit in the reconstruction of the tree for different degrees of randomness . the errors may concern both topology of the tree ( the branching hierarchy ) and , in case of correct topology , the proportions of the tree ( length of various branches ) . the paper is organized as follows : sections 2 is devoted to the deterministic process which is associated to the genealogical distances .",
    "we also show there how to exactly reconstruct the genealogical tree form them .",
    "in section 3 we define and discuss the random process associated to the genetic distances . in section 4",
    "we introduce a measure of topological distance between two tree and we quantify how topologically wrong is the tree reconstructed from genetic distances . in sections 5",
    "we quantify the error concerning the length of various branches of topologically correct trees .",
    "finally section 6 contains conclusions and outlook . the paper is completed by an appendix where we have moved some lengthy calculations .",
    "we consider a very general model of a population of constant size @xmath0 whose generations are not overlapping in time : any generation is replaced by a new one and any individual has a single parent .",
    "the stochastic rule which assigns the number of offspring to any individual can be chosen in many ways .",
    "in fact , for large population size , results do not depend on the details of this rule , the only requirement is that the probability of having the same parent for two individuals must be of order @xmath1 for large @xmath0 . here",
    "we choose the wright - fisher rule : any individual in the new generation chooses one parent at random in the previous one , independently on the choice of the others .",
    "the genealogical distance between two given individuals is the number of generations from the closest common ancestor . for large @xmath0 distances",
    "are proportional to @xmath0 , it is then useful to re - scale them dividing by @xmath0 .",
    "+ so let us define @xmath2 as the rescaled genealogical distance between individuals @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a population of size @xmath0 . for two distinct individuals @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the same generation one has    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the parents of @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "accordingly with the wright - fisher rule , parents are chosen among all possible ones with equal probability @xmath1 and , therefore , @xmath6 and @xmath7 coincide with probability @xmath1 . in this case the distance @xmath8 vanishes . on the contrary ,",
    "the parents of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are distinct individuals @xmath9 and @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 .",
    "the above equation , when considered all the @xmath12 pairs , entirely defines the dynamics of the population and simply states that the rescaled distance in the new generation increases by @xmath1 with respect to the parents distance .",
    "briefly , @xmath13 with probability @xmath1 and @xmath14 with probability @xmath11 .",
    "this equation can be iterated for any of the possible @xmath12 initial pairs @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which correspond to the entries of an upper triangular matrix .",
    "the iteration stops when there is a coincidence of parents and in this way all the distances @xmath2 can be calculated .    shortly : iteration of equation [ dynamics ] gives as output the realization of the random @xmath12 distances @xmath2 which are the entries of an upper triangular matrix containing all the necessary information for the reconstruction of the genealogical tree of the population .",
    "the tree is completely identified by its topology and by the time separation of all branching events . there",
    "exist many methods that can be used for this reconstruction , a simple one is the unweighted pair group method average ( upgma )  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm works as follows : it first identifies the two individuals with shortest distance , and put their branching at their time separation .",
    "then , it treats this pair as a new single object whose distance from the other individuals is the average of the distance of its two components .",
    "subsequently , among the new group of objects it identifies the pair with the shortest distance , and so on . at the end , one",
    "is left with only two objects which represents the two main branches , whose distance gives the time position of the root of the tree .",
    "then , the time from the last common ancestor of all individuals in the populations results fixed .",
    "this method works for any kind of upper triangular matrix representing distances among pairs of individuals , not necessarily originated by the coalescent process . in the coalescent case",
    ", nevertheless , the method gives the correct tree reproducing the historical branching events and the correct time separations among them .",
    "notice , that at any time it chooses two individuals with shortest distance .",
    "then , it is easy to realize that for the coalescent the distance of the two individuals from any third one is the same . therefore , in this case , all upgma averages are between pairs with identical distances so that also the resulting new common distances are the same .",
    "genealogical trees are very complex objects and genealogical distances are distributed according to a probability density which remains random in the limit of large population  @xcite .",
    "anyway , the mathematical theory of coalescent gives us the ability to deduce some important information about their statistical structure .",
    "consider a sample of @xmath15 individuals in a population of size @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is very large with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "the probability that they all have different parents in the previous generation is @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the probability that their ancestors are still all different in a past time @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath18 generations is @xmath19^{tn}$ ] . if @xmath0 is large compared to @xmath15 this quantity is approximately @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the genealogical tree results from this rule : the average probability density for the time lag for the coalescent event for @xmath15 individuals is @xmath22  @xcite",
    ".    therefore , the tree starts at the root with the two main branches , then , the following branching event is at a random time lag @xmath23 with probability density @xmath24 and after this time the tree has three branches ( see fig .",
    "[ tree3 ] ) .",
    "the next branching is after a time lag @xmath25 with probability density is @xmath26 and then the tree has four branches , and so on .",
    "as already mentioned , in the coalescent model , genealogical distances measure the time from the last common ancestor of two individuals .",
    "nevertheless , in almost all real situations , we have to deal with genetic distances reconstructed from directly measurable empirical quantities .    in case of complex organisms",
    ", mtdna is inherited only from the mother and , therefore , it undergoes to haploid reproduction , so in this case genetic distances are proportional to the number of mutations occurred in the compared mtdna sequences ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "analogously languages can be considered as haploid individuals whose vocabulary changes accumulate in time , in this case genetic distances can be evaluated by lexical distances  @xcite .    in both cases",
    ", an individual randomly accumulates mutations at a constant rate and the genetic distance of a pair of individuals is the sum of the mutations that they accumulated since their last common ancestor ( rescaled by @xmath0 ) . as a consequence , genetic distances are proportional only on average to genealogical ones .",
    "therefore , we have to modify the deterministic equation ( [ dynamics ] ) in order to take into account this randomness .",
    "we may assume that increments in the genetic distance have the simple form    @xmath27    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the parents of @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are random variables associated to the mutations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "they are zero if the genome of the parent is transmitted unaltered and a positive constant if a mutation occurs .",
    "we assume that the probability is @xmath30 for zero and @xmath31 for the positive constant @xmath32 . in a compact form :    @xmath33    this rule grants that genetic distances are equal to genealogical distances on average , in fact , the expected value of the sum @xmath34 is @xmath1 .",
    "notice that we compare genealogical distances generated by ( [ dynamics ] ) with genetic ones generated by ( [ dynamics2 ] ) .",
    "since they describe two aspects of the same population , the family history must be the same .",
    "this means that the realization of the part of the process which assigns parents in ( [ dynamics ] ) and in ( [ dynamics2 ] ) must also be the same ( @xmath35 ) , the only difference lays in the deterministic / random nature of the distance increment . in other words , the parents of two individuals @xmath3 and @xmath4 are unequivocally assigned . then , their genealogical distance is @xmath36 , while the genetic one is @xmath37 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the previously defined random variables .",

    "we have used the same realization of the process for 700 individuals and we have chosen @xmath38 for the genetic distances .",
    "we can see that while genealogical distances may assume only few values where their distribution has spikes  @xcite , the genetic ones are dispersed around them .",
    "the dispersion decreases when @xmath39 increases and when @xmath40 genetic distances lose their randomness in mutations , and they equal , for any realization , the associated genealogical ones ( compare ( [ dynamics ] ) with ( [ dynamics2 ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) ) . in case of a very large population ( @xmath41 ) the coincidence of the two sets of distances is recovered in the @xmath42 limit .",
    "the problem , in most practical cases , is that genealogical distances are unknown and one would like to reconstruct the genealogical tree of a population from the measured genetic distances .",
    "this is the case of biology where strands of mtdna are compared as well of lexicostatistics where vocabularies or grammar structures take the same role of mtdna .    as mentioned in previous section , when @xmath43 equations ( [ dynamics ] ) and ( [ dynamics2 ] ) coincide and randomness in mutations is lost . in this limiting case genetic and genealogical distances are equal and",

    "a qualitative understanding of the problem is immediate from fig.[tree ]  where four trees of twenty leaves are reconstructed .",

    "the realization of the genealogical process ( the family history ) is the same for the four pictures .",
    "one can see that the quality of the reconstruction decreases for smaller @xmath39 .",

    "the quality of the reproductions of the first tree ( the correct one ) by the others is lower for smaller @xmath39 both for what concerns topology and time depths.,width=604 ]    we start the quantitative study of the quality of reconstruction considering the simplest situation of tree with three leaves .",
    "the topology of a three leaves tree is completely determinate by the pair of individuals that first match together because their distance is the smallest .",
    "consequently , the genealogical and the genetic trees reconstructed by the upgma will have the same topology if the same pair of individuals has both the smallest genetic and genealogical distance .",
    "let us call @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath53 the three individuals , and assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pair with the smallest genealogical distance @xmath2 . by the argument in section 2",

    "the advantage is that the four new variables are independent and can be obtained as the sum of variables of type ( [ gamma ] ) where the sum goes on a number which is @xmath0 times the time lag of the associated branch .",
    "namely , @xmath25 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath23 for @xmath70 and @xmath74 for @xmath69 .",
    "given this construction we can trivially but painfully compute ( see the appendix ) the conditional probability @xmath75 and , then , the absolute probability of a wrong tree @xmath76 as the marginal of the joint probability @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the exponential densities previously described .",

    "the full line corresponds to the probability of a wrong topology p(w ) for a three leaves tree while crosses correspond to the esd of a 20 leaves tree , estimated numerically .",
    "in the first case , computed exactly , the esd is twice the probability of a wrong topology.,width=491 ]    if we take into account more than three individuals the situation immediately becomes more complicated since the possible tree topologies increase exponentially with the number of leaves .",
    "so we need to introduce a measure of difference between the genealogical tree and an associated genetic one .",
    "the simplest tree distance measure is the robinson - foulds symmetric difference @xcite , which only depends on the topology of the two tree and not on the differences in branches length .",
    "the symmetric difference ( sd ) is computed by considering all possible branches that may exist in the two trees .",
    "each inner branch , i.e. a branch connecting two nodes or one node to the root , identifies a clade in the set of leaves .",
    "the resulting distance is simply the number of clades present in one of the considered trees but not in the other .",
    "therefore , two identical trees have zero sd , but it is sufficient to exchange two leaves on one of them to have a non zero sd",
    ".    in general sd has not an immediate statistical interpretation , i.e. we can not say whether a larger distance is significantly larger than a smaller one . anyway , in the particular case of trees with only three leaves the expected symmetric distance is twice the wrong topology probability @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , in a three leaves tree there is only one clade and the symmetric distance is equal to 0 in the case of correct topology ( if both trees have the same clade ) and is equal to 2 in the case of wrong one ( if clades are different ) .",
    "consequently , in this simple case , the expected sd ( that we call esd ) is given by the relation    @xmath81    in order to compute numerically the esd between a genealogical tree and the associated genetic one with parameter @xmath82 we use the following procedure : we take 20 individuals in a population of 500 ( a large one ) and we use upgma to reconstruct their genealogical tree from a realization of the genealogical distances matrix .",
    "then , we construct several associated genetic trees ( @xmath83 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 for greater values ) and we compute their averaged sd with respect to the associated genealogical tree . we start again with a new realization of the matrix of genealogical distances and we repeat the procedure , ending with a new averaged sd .",
    "we do it many times ( from @xmath86 for @xmath87 to @xmath88 for @xmath89 ) and , finally , we take the mean of all averaged sd and we end with a quantity that should be very close to esd . the number of genealogical trees and that of the associated genetic trees that we use for estimating the esd increases with @xmath39 since we observe an increasing fluctuation in the sd values .    in fig .",
    "[ td ] we plot the estimated esd of the 20 leaves tree",
    ". we also plot the exactly computed @xmath76 of a three leaves tree which is one half its esd .",
    "we find out , unexpectedly , that they only differ for a factor due to the total number of clades , which depends on the number of leaves .",
    "now we study the problem of differences among branches length in genealogical and genetic trees .",
    "we first derive the probability of the error between the genetic and genealogical distances of two individuals , and then we will sketch out the computation of the errors for the distances in a tree of three individuals .",
    "we will consider only the cases in which genetic and genealogical tree have the same topology . in this way",
    "the integral of the probability of the error ( errors for the three leaves case ) will be equal to the total probability of having the right topology @xmath90 . obviously , the right topology condition is always satisfied for two individuals ( @xmath91 .    in a tree of two individuals",
    "we have only a single genealogical distance to be compared with a single genetic one .",
    "let us call @xmath17 the genealogical distance and @xmath92 the genetic one , that is the number of mutations on both the genealogical branches divided by @xmath39 .",
    "we call @xmath93 the total number of mutations on these two branches , then @xmath17 and @xmath92 will be equal only if @xmath94 . by using equations ( [ gamma ] )",
    "we can write the expression of the conditional probability of having @xmath95 mutations along the two genealogical branches with lengths @xmath18 and , therefore , total length @xmath96 :    @xmath97    where the approximation holds for large @xmath0 .",
    "one easily gets the conditional averages @xmath98@xmath95@xmath99 and @xmath98@xmath100@xmath101 .",
    "it is than straightforward to define the error between genetic and genealogical distance as @xmath102 , in this way , in fact , one gets the conditional ( with respect to t ) averages @xmath98@xmath103@xmath104 and @xmath98@xmath105@xmath106 which do not depend on @xmath17 . as a consequence of this independence the absolute averages of @xmath103 and @xmath105 coincide with the conditional ones .",
    "the conclusion is that the typical error in evaluating the distance from the common ancestor grows linearly with @xmath107    the independence of the two conditional averages from @xmath17 does not implies that the conditional probability density for @xmath103 is itself independent on @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , since one has @xmath108 and , therefore , @xmath109 , the conditional probability density of the error turns out to be    @xmath110    where the @xmath111 are dirac delta functions . this conditional density for @xmath103 given",
    "a genealogical distance @xmath17 , at variance with its two first moments , clearly depends on @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the absolute probability density @xmath112 can be calculated as the marginal of the joint probability density @xmath113 , where @xmath114@xmath115@xmath116 is the density of the genealogical distances .",

    "we have seen the probability of having the correct topology for a three leaves tree from the genetic matrix by using upgma . in the following",
    ", we will give a sketch of the derivation of the errors distribution of its two characteristic distances .",
    "hereafter we restrict our analysis to the non - ambiguous situation in which the topology of the genetic tree is the same as that of the genealogical one",
    ". we will refer to the scheme in fig.[tree3 ] and to the notation used in section4 .",
    "the genetic tree can be characterized by two distances : @xmath126 , separating the individuals with minimal genealogical distance @xmath25 and @xmath127/2 $ ] , calculated by upgma as the mean value of the major distances and therefore separating the third individual from the others",
    ". the distance @xmath128 does not correspond to the maximum genetic distance but it is the mean value of the two major distances and gives a better estimate of the coalescence time @xmath129 of three individuals to the common ancestor .",
    "we have seen that on average @xmath92 coincides with @xmath25 , @xmath128 on average is equal to @xmath130 , but , in general , the genetic distances will be different from the genealogical ones and the branches of the tree reconstructed from the genetic matrix by upgma will not have the same length as those of the genealogical tree .",
    "here we define , in analogy with the two leaves case , the errors @xmath131 and @xmath132 of @xmath92 and @xmath128 by the equations : @xmath133 the variables @xmath131 and @xmath132 vanish when the genetic distances equal the genealogical ones .    in order to compute the probability density of the errors we use the relations introduced in previous section and we rewrite the relations ( [ errel ] ) in the form    @xmath134    since @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath135 are independent variables which we described in previous section it is straightforward but painful to compute the conditional probability @xmath136 .",
    "the sketch goes as follows : first we write the joint conditional probability for the independent variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath135 as    @xmath137    where the explicit expression for the probabilities @xmath138 is shown in the appendix ( see ( [ pn ] ) )",

    "once we have @xmath145 we can compute the joint probability @xmath146 and after integration over @xmath23 and @xmath25 we obtain the joint density @xmath147 .",
    "the normalization of this density equals the probability @xmath148 of correct topology identification by upgma .",
    "more complex tree could be considered in principle , both for what concerns topology and branches length , nevertheless , the number of calculations increases exponentially .",
    "the inner randomness of genetic mutations is an obstacle for a safe reconstruction of a genealogical tree .",
    "a wrong reconstruction is more probable the smaller is the probability of a mutation .",
    "this is a serious problem since in many cases in biology the distances are measured by a molecular clock which is obtained comparing short strands of dna which slowly accumulate errors along reproduction events ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we are able to quantify , in simple but relevant cases , the probability of a wrong reconstruction of a tree , both for what concerns the topology and the proportions .",
    "we can , for example , give the error concerning the time separation of two species using results in section 5 and we are also able to decide the probability of a wrong reconstruction for a family tree of three species using results in section 4 .",
    "we plan to continue this investigation in order to better quantify the difference between the genetic and the genealogical matrices of distances .",
    "we think for example to the possibility of introducing a measure of distance between the associated probabilities of distances .",
    "even more important , it is to find a method to estimate the value of the parameter @xmath39 given an empirical distribution of genetic distances",
    ". this would be useful for situations in which the value of @xmath39 is not known @xmath149 as , for example , for the languages in the indo - european and austronesian groups  @xcite .",
    "this method would allow us to use the results of this paper for evaluating the fidelity level of phylogenetic trees reconstructed from empirical lexical distances .",

    "therefore , we have to determine the total probability for the set of triplets @xmath166 , where the variables @xmath167 can take only values multiple of @xmath168 and have to satisfy the conditions @xmath160@xmath169@xmath170 , @xmath171@xmath169@xmath172 $ ] and @xmath173@xmath169@xmath174 .",

    "since the three events are independent , using the exponential distributions of the coalescent times @xmath189 , i.e. of the length of the branches of the genealogical tree , we have : @xmath190 where the factor 2 comes from the jacobian of the transformation @xmath191@xmath115@xmath192@xmath115@xmath193@xmath194@xmath195 .",
    "the conditional probabilities in the integral are all of the form @xmath138 as given by the expression @xmath196 which is easily derivable from equation([kt ] ) and the second approximations holds for large populations ( @xmath41 ) .    in the same way one has that the probability @xmath154 of event @xmath51 is the probability of having @xmath160@xmath197@xmath162 and @xmath173@xmath115@xmath198 .",
