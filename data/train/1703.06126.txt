    "the primary aim of this paper is to relate the fortuin - kasteleyn - ginibre ( fkg ) inequality to the study of the main eigenvalue problem for ruelle operator associated to an attractive potential @xmath16 having low regularity ( meaning @xmath16 lives outside of the classical hlder , walters and bowen spaces ) .",
    "the fkg inequality @xcite is a strong correlation inequality and a fundamental tool in statistical mechanics",
    ". an earlier version of this inequality for product measures was obtained by harris in @xcite .",
    "holley in @xcite generalized the fkg inequality in the context of finite distributive lattice . in the context of symbolic dynamics",
    "the fkg inequality can be formulated as follows .",
    "let us consider the symbolic space @xmath0 with an additional structure which is a partial order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , if @xmath3 , for all @xmath4 .",
    "a function @xmath5 is said _ increasing _",
    "if for all @xmath6 , such that @xmath2 , we have @xmath7 a borel probability measure @xmath8 over @xmath9 will be said to satisfy the fkg inequality if for any pair of continuous increasing functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 we have @xmath17 in probability theory such measure are sometimes called _",
    "positively associated_.",
    "our first result asserts that for any potential @xmath18 ( definition [ classe - e ] ) the probability measure defined in satisfies the fkg inequality . as a consequence of this result",
    "we are able to shown that at least one eigenprobability of @xmath19 , associated to its spectral radius , must satisfies the fkg inequality . some similar results for @xmath11-measures where obtained by p. hulse in @xcite . potentials satisfying a condition similar to definition [ classe - e ]",
    "are called _ attractive potentials _ on these papers , which is a terminology originated from _ attractive specifications _ sometimes used in statistical mechanics .",
    "the class @xmath20 includes some interesting examples of potentials @xmath16 as the ones described by ( [ nonsimp ] ) and ( [ simp ] ) .",
    "establishing fkg inequality for continuous potentials with low regularity is a key step to study , for example , the dyson model on the lattice @xmath13 , within the framework of thermodynamic formalism .",
    "a dyson model ( see @xcite ) is a special long - range ferromagnetic ising model , commonly defined on the lattice @xmath21 .",
    "the dyson model is a very important example in statistical mechanics exhibiting the phase transition phenomenon in one dimension .",
    "this model still is a topic of active research and currently it is being studied in both lattices @xmath13 and @xmath21 , see the recent preprints @xcite and references therein . in both works",
    "whether the dlr - gibbs measures associated to the dyson model is a @xmath11-measures is asked .",
    "in @xcite the authors proved that the dyson model on the lattice @xmath13 has phase transition .",
    "this result is an important contribution to the theory of thermodynamic formalism since very few examples of phase transition on the lattice @xmath13 are known ( see @xcite ) . in this work",
    "is also proved that the critical temperature of the dyson model on the lattice @xmath13 is at most four times the critical temperature of dyson model on the lattice @xmath21 .",
    "the authors also conjectured that the critical temperature for both models coincides .",
    "we remark that the explicit value of the critical temperature for the dyson model on both lattices still is an open problem .",
    "moreover there are very few examples in both thermodynamic formalism and statistical mechanics , where the explicit value of the critical temperature is known .",
    "a remarkable example where the critical temperatures is explicitly obtained is the famous work by lars onsager @xcite and the main idea behind this computation is the transfer operator .    although the ruelle operator @xmath22 ( associated to the potential @xmath16 ) have been intensively studied , since its creation in 1968 , and became a key concept in thermodynamic formalism a little is known about @xmath22 , when @xmath16 is the dyson potential .",
    "the difficult in using this operator to study the dyson model is the absence of positive continuous eigenfunctions associated to the spectral radius of its action on @xmath14 .",
    "an alternative to overcome this problem is to consider extensions of this operator to larger spaces than @xmath14 , where a weak version of ruelle - perron - frobenius theorem can be obtained .",
    "we point out that continuous potentials may not have a continuous positive eigenfunction but the dual of the ruelle operator always has an eigenprobability .",
    "here we study the extension of the ruelle operator to the lebesgue space @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is an eigenmeasure for @xmath25 .",
    "we study the existence problem of the main eigenfunction in such spaces by using the involution kernel and subsequently the lions - lax - milgram theorem .    in another direction",
    "we show how to use the involution kernel representation of the main eigenfunction and the fkg inequality to obtain non - trivial upper bound for the topological pressure of potentials of the form @xmath26 which is associated to a long - range ising model , when @xmath27 is suitable chosen .",
    "a particular interesting case occurs when @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( see end of section 5 in @xcite for the relation with the classical long - range ising model interaction ) .",
    "the above mentioned upper bound coincides with the topological pressure of a _ product - type potential _",
    "@xmath30 ( which is different but similar to the previous one ) given by @xmath31 see @xcite for the computation of the topological pressure of @xmath30 .",
    "in some sense we can think of this model as a simplified version of the previous one . in this simpler model",
    "is possible to exhibit explicit expressions for the eigenfunction and eigenprobability of the ruelle operator @xmath32 , see @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath28 for all @xmath33 , for both potentials and .",
    "although the potentials @xmath16 and @xmath30 have completely different physical interpretations ( two - body interactions versus self interaction ) from the thermodynamic formalism point of view they have interesting similarities .",
    "for example , in the simplified model ( case [ simp ] ) one can show that the ruelle operator stops having positive continuous eigenfunction if @xmath34 ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , in a similar fashion",
    ", the authors in @xcite prove the existence of phase transition - on this sense - for the potential @xmath16 in case [ nonsimp ] .",
    "we remark that figure [ fig5 ] on section [ sim ] - obtained via a numerical approximation - corroborate and illustrate such claims .",
    "when @xmath35 , the eigenfunctions associated to both potentials are very well - behaved and they belong to the walters space .",
    "although for @xmath36 we do not have phase transition for the potential @xmath30 the unique non - negative eigenfunction for @xmath32 is such that its values oscillate between zero and infinity in any cylinder subset of @xmath9 . on the other hand , if @xmath37 then we know from @xcite that there is phase transition for the potential @xmath16 .",
    "these observations suggest that the main eigenfunction of @xmath32 carries information about phase transition for the potential @xmath16 .    in section [ inv ]",
    "we show how to use the involution kernel in order to construct an `` eigenfunction '' ( the quotes is because of they are only defined on a dense subset of @xmath9 ) for the dyson model associated to the spectral radius of the ruelle operator .",
    "some results of p. hulse are generalized to non normalized potentials in section [ classf ] and use some stochastic dominations coming from these extensions to obtain uniqueness results for eigenprobabilities for a certain class of potentials with low regularity .",
