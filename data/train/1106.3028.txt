    "in the standard model , a meson is composed of a quark and an anti - quark , bound together by the strong interaction . through the studying of the mass spectrum of mesons",
    ", we can demonstrate the correctness of the quantum fields theory , and predict the particle s mass that has not been found yet in the experiments .",
    "many articles had studied the meson mass spectrum problems and got many very good results  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "most authors used the schr@xmath7dinger equation to solve the problem .",
    "their treatment is accurate enough for the heavy mesons , which are composed by two heavy quarks and moving slowly , thus may be treated non - relativistically .",
    "let s take an estimate .",
    "if we think the mass of a meson is the combination of the total mass , kinetic and potential energies of the two composition quarks , the binding energy ( kinetic + potential ) is calculated and listed in table  [ table : quark ] . the constituent mass  @xcite values we used are : @xmath8 gev , @xmath9 gev , @xmath10 gev , @xmath11 gev , @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 gev .",
    "the `` ratio '' column is defined as @xmath14 compared to the light quark s mass in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons , their kinetic and potential energies are not very large .",
    "but in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath18 mesons , the ratio is very large .",
    "so the light quarks in these mesons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath18 , are moving with relativistic energies .",
    "thus requires us to use relativistic equation , the dirac equation , to solve the spectrum problem .",
    "ccccc @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & ratio + @xmath0&1.975&@xmath23&0.37&1.23 + @xmath1&2.075&@xmath24&0.32&0.75 + @xmath2&5.314&@xmath25&0.37&1.23 + @xmath18&5.410&@xmath26&0.32&0.75 + @xmath15&3.097&@xmath27&0.40&0.28 + @xmath16&9.464&@xmath28&0.40&0.09 + @xmath17&6.264&@xmath29&0.40&0.28 +    [ table : quark ]    we should point out that the quark s mass we used here is the constituent quark mass , which is the quark s current mass plus the mass of the gluon fields and sea - quarks , as the effective quark mass of the valence quark .",
    "the current quark mass means the mass of a quark itself only .",
    "values of the composition mass and current mass differ greatly .",
    "for example , proton s mass is about 0.938 gev .",
    "the rest current masses of its three valence quarks are only about 0.011 gev each .",
    "but we can treat the mass of each up or down quark with constituent mass as large as 0.30 gev .    in a charm meson",
    ", there are two quarks , with @xmath30 .",
    "so we may simplify the problem by treat the heavier quark s mass as infinite .",
    "then the problem is reduced to the light quark moving in the funnel potential that created by the heavier quark . solving the dirac equation with the funnel potential",
    ", we can get the eigenenergy of the light quark in the funnel potential .",
    "because of the dirac equation includes the light quark s spin - orbit interaction , the eigenenergy will reflect the splitting of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "the influence of the heavier quark is treated by adding its mass in the spin dependant force .",
    "the total mass of the meson can be expressed as : @xmath31 that s the sum of the masses of the two quarks @xmath32 and @xmath33 , eigenenergy of the system @xmath34 , and the hyper - fine energy splitting @xmath35 .",
    "m. g. olsson  @xcite shows that the dirac equation can be used to get a good fitting in the average mass spectrum .",
    "but he did not calculate the fine structure splitting .",
    "d. ebert , v. o. galkin and r. n. faustov  @xcite use schr@xmath7dinger equation with relativistic potential to solve the mass spectrum and calculate the fine splitting .",
    "they point out that in the spin dependent potentials , we should use @xmath36 , instead of use @xmath37 in eichten and quigg s paper @xcite to get energy splitting .    in this paper",
    ", we will solve the dirac equation numerically to fit the meson s mass spectrum of the heavy - light quarks combination system , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath18 , and calculate the spin - orbit energy hyper fine splitting .",
    "our result will be compared to the experimental data .",
    "the dirac equation for free particle is @xmath38    if the potential has spherical symmetry , and can be written as a combination of lorentz scalar part @xmath39 and vector coulomb potential @xmath40 , then the dirac equation can be written as  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite : @xmath41\\psi , \\label{eq : dirv}\\ ] ] with the solution has the form like @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is a two component generalization of the spherical harmonic functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 the number @xmath46 is @xmath47 in which the @xmath48 sign is @xmath49 thus the coupled equations for the radial functions are @xmath50 f(r ) & = & -\\frac{dg(r)}{dr}- \\frac{1-k}{r}g(r ) , \\label{eq : ffgg1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 g(r ) & = & \\frac{df(r)}{dr}+ \\frac{1+k}{r}f(r ) .",

    "the one gluon exchange coulomb - like potential  @xcite between two quarks is @xmath63 in which @xmath64      at large distances , there should exist a confine potential that describes the color confinement .",
    "unfortunately , till now , the color confinement can not be derived from the qcd first principle .",
    "so we may add it in `` by hand '' .",
    "the commonly used cornell confinement potential  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite is @xmath65 which will make the combination of the scalar @xmath39 and vector @xmath40 potential has a funnel shape .",
    "the spectrum obtained with the funnel potential is in good agreement with experimental data for the light and heavy mesons  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "typical values for the parameters are @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "in qed , the relativistic dirac equation describes two or more massive spin 1/2 particles interacting electromagnetically .",
    "the perturbation qed formula of the fine splitting includes spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath68 ) , spin - spin interaction ( @xmath69 ) , and breit spin - spin tensor interaction ( @xmath70 ) terms .    within the framework of qcd",
    ", there are similar potentials .",
    "if the schrdinger equation is used to solve the mass spectrum problem , the spin - dependent hyper - fine energy splitting to the first order of @xmath71 can be written as  @xcite : @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 in which @xmath75.\\ ] ]    now we use the dirac equation to solve the mass spectrum .",

    "so when we use the dirac equation to study energy splitting , the @xmath81 term should be removed from @xmath82 in equ.([eq : tt3 ] ) .",
    "since we treat the heavier quark s mass as infinite in the dirac equation , the fracture @xmath83 will be replaced by a meaningful limited number : over energy eigenvalue , @xmath84 .",
    "now the terms in the energy splitting equ.([eq : delta ] ) will be @xmath85 and @xmath86    there is a trick in calculating the @xmath87 term in equ.([eq : tt4 ] ) .",
    "it can be replaced by the production of the wave function and a @xmath88 function : @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath88 function can be defined as @xmath90 so @xmath91 which can be easily integrated numerically .    by adding the spin dependant part ( [ eq : delta ] ) with ( [ eq : t4 ] ) and ( [ eq : tt4 ] ) , into the solution of equ.([eq : ffgg1 ] ) and equ.([eq : ffgg2 ] )",
    ", we will get the meson spectrum with fine structure energy splitting .",
    "we will use the double shooting method and runge - kutta 4th method to solve the dirac equation . because the dirac equation for the hydrogen - like atom has exact analytical solution , we first run our program on the hydrogen - like atom case to test whether our code works or not .",
    "the test results are shown in appendix a , that we can get up to @xmath92 accuracy .",
    "next we run with olsson s parameters and the funnel potential to compare to olsson s  @xcite results , which are shown in appendix b.    finally with the funnel potential @xmath93 we solve the dirac equation numerically with our own parameters . because meson has a confining part of potential , the wave function tends to contract to the center .",
    "so the system will be smaller in scale than the hydrogen - like atom , which does not have a confining part . according to our test , we choose the boundary condition as @xmath94 and @xmath95 the radial part of the wave functions will be normalized with the simpson s integration rule to one , @xmath96    the fitting method is done by inputting two mesons masses as initial values to determine the parameters in the expression ( [ eq : delta ] ) , equ ( [ eq : ffgg1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ffgg2 ] ) . then use the trial parameters , input configuration parameters of an unknown meson , to get the mass of that unknown meson .",
