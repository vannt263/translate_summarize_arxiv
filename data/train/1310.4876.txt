    "<S> such species - specific localisation was previously observed only in asymmetric binary mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that the recent observation of ergodic behavior up to @xmath2 in a hard - sphere system is not evidence for activated dynamics , but an effect of polydispersity .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _ - despite many decades of experimental , theoretical and simulational effort , the glass transition remains only partially understood . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery in the 1980s that hard - sphere - like , sterically - stabilised polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) colloids underwent kinetic arrest @xcite at a packing fraction of @xmath3 opened up a fruitful avenue of investigation , because many features of such kinetic arrest in colloids can be mapped onto analogues in atomic and molecular glasses . in particular , hard sphere colloids have become a favourite test bed for mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite . apart from over - estimating the tendency to vitrify ( @xmath4 ) , mct gives a quantitative account of the main features on approach to arrest , such as a two - step decay in the system s intermediate scattering function ( isf ) and power - law dependence of transport coefficients on @xmath5 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such correspondence between mct and colloidal experiments notwithstanding , doubts have been raised as to whether hard spheres really do undergo a glass transition at @xmath6 . some point to the ease with which monodisperse hard spheres at @xmath7 crystallise in simulations @xcite and in microgravity experiments @xcite to suggest that the arrest observed in experiments is due to the inevitable presence in real samples of size polydispersity ( @xmath8 , defined as the standard deviation of the size divided by the mean size ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent simulations @xcite have shown that particle dynamics near @xmath9 is nearly invariant for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both polydisperse and monodisperse hard spheres form glasses , only that monodisperse hard spheres are poor glass formers : they crystallise very easily .    </S>",
    "<S> others suggest that the ideal glass transition in hard spheres is preempted by activated processes not taken into account by mct . </S>",
    "<S> a recent study @xcite appears to support this view . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the isf of pmma colloids over 7 decades in time show that the system remains ergodic at @xmath7 , to at least 0.60 , reinforcing the view that activated processes delay the glass transition well beyond mct ; indeed , the suggestion is that there is perhaps no arrest before random close packing @xmath11 .    the work of brambilla et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has generated significant controversy . </S>",
    "<S> some pointed out their data were largely compatible with mct if uncertainties in measuring @xmath0 @xcite were taken into account @xcite , while others suggested that the large polydispersity ( @xmath12 ) used in @xcite to avoid crystallisation could be responsible for the supposed regime of activated dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of  @xcite subsequently simulated polydisperse hard spheres with a top hat particle size distribution ( psd ) and reported relaxation times compatible with experiments , concluding that polydispersity was _ not _ relevant for their findings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the issue stands unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> its resolution is crucial , since it pertains to the utility or otherwise of a putative model system for glassy arrest .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed extensive simulations of glassy arrest in concentrated , polydisperse hard spheres with psds of several shapes , including a psd measured experimentally by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) for polydisperse pmma colloids very similar to those used by brambilla and coworkers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution is very asymmetric and skewed to the left with an extended tail of small particles , and is well described by a weibull distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results for this distribution with those that we obtain for gaussian and top hat psds with the same variance . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the average diffusion coefficient ( or equivalently the relaxation time ) is independent of the shape of the psd , but only depends on the variance , and confirm the observations in @xcite that no arrest occurs at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we focus our attention on subpopulations of particles , we observe a dramatic dependence of dynamics on the psd .    for the realistic psd , relevant for interpreting the data in @xcite , we find that the large particles undergo an ideal glass transition , compatible with mct , at @xmath14 , while the small particles remain mobile . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , such a localisation transition has been seen before only in asymmetric binary mixtures @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this residual ergodicity is _ not _ the result of activated processes ; rather , it is a direct consequence of polydispersity .     for the experimental distribution , differentiating small and large particles from the average . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law fit ( dashed line ) with @xmath71 and @xmath72 describes well the large particles data , while small particles remain mobile at all investigated @xmath0.,width=317 ]    it is important to ask whether these findings depend specifically on the psd , and if so whether they are mostly determined by @xmath8 or by the psd s whole shape . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore repeat the simulations for state points where full equilibrium could be achieved using a gaussian distribution with @xmath48 and a top hat distribution with @xmath73 , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : diff - shapes](a ) shows that averaged over the whole system , @xmath55 is essentially independent of the shape of the psd , but depends only on its variance .    however , important differences emerge between the top hat and the other two psds at comparable @xmath8 when we analyse the contributions from small and large particles , plotted in fig .

    "<S> @xmath42 has decreased to @xmath75 at @xmath76 for the experimental psd . with the top - hat psd , this diffusivity ratio is @xmath77 times less extreme , i.e. , selective localisation of the larger particles is a much weaker effect . presumably , this is because defining sub - populations of small and large particles makes little sense in a uniform distribution compared to the same exercise in strongly - peaked psds . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , unlike the experimental psd , the sub - population of large particles in the top - hat psd does not clearly show an ideal glass transition ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a uniform distribution with the same @xmath8 as the experimental psd does _ not _ reproduce key qualitative features of the microscopic dynamics of a system with the experimental psd .    </S>",
    "<S> note from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diff - shapes](b ) that using a ( peaked ) gaussian psd largely reproduces the behavior of the experimental psd , especially at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , there is residual diffusivity in all three psds at @xmath78 . even in the top hat , this is due to a gradation of dynamics from large to small particles ( see supplementary material ) , despite the absence of partial arrest . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : diff - shapes](b ) also shows that lowering @xmath8 decreases the difference between @xmath41 and @xmath79 . </S>",

    "<S> such decoupling might have been expected from the diffusivities of these sub - populations , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diff - shapes](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , studies of binary mixtures @xcite have shown that a full decoupling between self and collective dynamics only occurs for size ratios @xmath87 , beyond the extremes of size disparity that are present in our experimental psd , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exp ] . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : tau ] ( bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath79 begins to drop precipitously relative to @xmath41 at high @xmath0 , @xmath92 fails to rise in proportional relative to its ` small ' counterpart , @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> if we take @xmath44 as a surrogate for viscosity , then the lack of scaling between @xmath40 and @xmath44 can be seen as a manifestation of the violation of the stokes - einstein relation ( ser ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ser violation is ubiquitous in atomic and molecular glass formers @xcite , where the product @xmath94 increases on approaching the glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is commonly interpreted as evidence for increasing spatial heterogeneities in the dynamics . in our case , there is a far sharper rise in @xmath95 with @xmath0 than in @xmath96 . </S>",

    "<S> reveal that large and small particles are randomly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our polydisperse system at @xmath97 can be conceptualised as a fluid of small spheres in a porous matrix of larger spheres close to the glass transition @xcite , where a high degree of dynamic heterogeneity in the mobile (= small in our case ) particles has been observed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions _ we have shown that polydispersity has highly non - trivial effects on the hard sphere glass transition . </S>",
