    "the chlorosomes are self - assembled structures of hundreds of thousands bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) molecules .",
    "they differ from other light - harvesting complexes by the absence of a protein matrix which supports the photosynthetic pigments and their very large size with lengths up to 200 nm @xcite .",
    "chlorosomes usually function in extremely low light conditions and are thus probably the most efficient light - harvesting antenna complexes in nature @xcite .",
    "these special properties makes the chlorosome a potential candidate for use in biomimetic light - harvesting devices @xcite . due to the heterogeneity of chlorosomes their structure",
    "can not be determined by crystallographic methods and structural information is scarce .",
    "however , thanks to recent advances in different areas , a structural model has been put forward for cholorosomes of the green sulfur bacterium _",
    "chlorobaculum tepidum _ @xcite .",
    "this model is based on a _ syn - anti _ array of bchl c pigments in tubular shape .",
    "one of the methods that were used to determine the structure of the chlorosome was to study mutant bacteria with three genes whose expression was prevented .",
    "the mutant bacteria have a more ordered structure of bchls which allowed x - ray crystallographic studies and showed the presence of an helical structure .",
    "interestingly enough , the mutant bacteria growth was much slower than the wild type bacteria .",
    "this observation together with the fact that the function of three genes was suppressed in order to make the structure less disordered hints to the possibility that disorder plays a biological function in chlorosomes and a disordered structure is favored by evolution .",
    "the obvious role for disorder is the broadening of the optical spectra that in an ordered structure would be too narrow as observed in similar artificial supramolecular structures @xcite .",
    "however , these results are paradoxical since disorder is also expected to localize the excitonic wave functions and inhibit energy diffusion according to the theory of anderson localization",
    ". since the seminal paper of anderson on the absence of diffusion for disordered quantum lattices @xcite , wave localization due to interference has been a central theme in condensed matter physics .",
    "one of the main tools for studying localization phenomena and , in general , disordered quantum systems has been random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "the rmt approach has also been applied to probe thermodynamic properties of closed systems as well as transport properties of open systems .",
    "one of the important results in the field is the statistical relationship between the spectral repulsion parameter @xmath0 and the wave function localization .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter can be used to locate the metal - insulator transtion in three dimensions @xcite and it has been shown that there are specific scaling laws between localization and the repulsion parameter in finite , disordered one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "localization in systems with dipolar interactions like the natural light - harvesting complexes have been shown to be much weaker than for the anderson model with only nearest neighbor coupling @xcite .",
    "quantum transport in disordered networks has been extensively studied in connection with its relevance for efficient energy transfer in light - harvesting systems .",
    "centrosymmetry and a dominant doublet spectral structure has been stablished as a general mechanism for highly efficient quantum transport even in the presence of disorder and the natural implementation of this mechanism in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex of green sulfur bacteria has also been explored @xcite .",
    "the extraordinary energy transfer properties of chlorosomes are attributed to cooperative phenomena in the bchl aggregates , which are known otherwise as superradiance and supertransfer .",
    "superradiance occurs when a group of emitters , situated at a distance from each other shorter than the wave length of the light , emits coherently with a very high intensity , and was discovered by dicke in the context of radiating atoms @xcite .",
    "it has been studied for supramolecular complexes and in the light - harvesting apparatus of bacterial photosynthesis @xcite . in the presence of disorder ,",
    "static or dynamic , superradiance is quenched , although , in a tight - binding model in a ring superradiance persists for disorder strengths below a critical value even in a regime with strong coupling to the external environment @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of one - dimensional disordered excitonic systems have been studied extensively , specially in the context of applications to j - aggregates @xcite .",
    "the localization length of the system has been shown to limit the number of monomers contributing to the superradiance @xcite .",
    "these results should also apply to supertransfer , a coined term describing non - radiative excitonic transfer of a superradiant patch @xcite .",
    "supertransfer has been ascribed to play a crucial role in the efficiency enhancement of light - harvesting systems , and in the chlorosome in particular @xcite .",
    "photosynthetic systems are arranged in hierarchical structures where energy funnelling from the chlorosome antenna towards the reaction center proceeds throughout a network of superradiant units .",
    "supertransfer refers to the excitation energy transfer ( eet ) between these superradiant patches .",
    "the properties of cylindrical chlorosomes have been studied before in the homogeneous case @xcite and in the disordered case @xcite .",
    "attempts have also been made at describing the excitonic dynamics in the presence of a bath using a high - temperature , stochastic treatment attributed to haken and strobl @xcite .    in this paper , we study the effects of disorder on the localization properties , the spectral statistics and the optical properties , in particular , superradiance , of chlorosomes .",
    "we try to give an answer to the previously mentioned paradox .",
    "the long range properties of the dipolar interaction between chromophores make the excitonic wave functions more robust against localization .",
    "however , for realistic values of disorder and size , there appears a localization - delocalization crossover as a function of the excitonic energy as monitored by the inverse participation ratio and the spectral statistics . precisely in the low - energy region where there appears more collectiveness in the optical behavior of the states for the clean system , the exciton is more localized when disorder is included . in the presence of static disorder",
    ", there is thus a compromise between the collective but localized low energy states ( with less nodes in the wave function ) and delocalization which happens at high energy .",
    "we find that the maximum of superradiance appears at the localization - delocalization crossover and moves to the high energy side of the spectrum as disorder increases .",
    "an optimal value of disorder depending on the environmental conditions exists between sufficient superradiance and a wide spectrum that could help explain the energy transfer properties of chlorosomes .",

    "far from the ground state , the localization length is much longer than the realistic system sizes that we have used ( 300 rings ) .",
    "for this reason the ipr of figure [ fig : ipr ] increases with larger aggregates in the delocalized region .",

    "the fact that the repulsion parameter decreases ( although very slightly in the middle of the band ) as a function of the total length of the chlorosome for all energies is an indication of the localization of the wave functions in the thermodynamic limit , as expected from theoretical considerations @xcite . in other words , while the localization length increases with the system size , the ratio localization length / system size tends to zero . for the largest aggregate size",
