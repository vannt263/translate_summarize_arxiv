    "one of the most studied questions relating to the properties of hadrons during the past decades has been how to describe exclusive reactions , and in particular electromagnetic form factors , in experimentally accessible regions of energy and momentum transfer . for momentum transfers of tens of , corresponding to characteristic wavelengths of less than 0.1 fm , ordinary constituent quark or flux tube models , which are a mainstay at much lower momentum transfers , appear to be inadequate , especially with increasing momentum transfer .",
    "improved fits have been possible through modification of cqm s such as the introduction of quark form factors  @xcite .    during the 1980 s",
    "there was considerable theoretical progress in the description of exclusive reactions at asymptotically high momentum transfers in terms of the fundamental current quarks , applying valence perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) ,  @xcite together with svz  @xcite sum rules . among the most important consequences of valence pqcd",
    "are the so called constituent counting rules , which predict relatively simple dependences of exclusive amplitudes as functions of momentum transfer .",
    "many reactions experimentally appear to obey these constituent counting rules .",
    "also , the magnetic nucleon elastic form factors and some resonant transition form factors could be roughly accounted for in magnitude through the application of the qcd sum rules  @xcite , leading to the possibility that valence pqcd would be applicable at kinematic conditions achieved at current or planned accelerator facilities .",
    "however , it had also been pointed out  @xcite that the results of utilizing pqcd sum rules led to seemingly unrealistic valence quark longitudinal momentum fraction distributions @xmath6 . when utilized in the pqcd calculations , these @xmath6 s led to inconsistent application of pqcd .",
    "another prediction of pqcd is hadron helicity conservation .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite at jefferson lab ( jlab ) , which have measured helicity non - conserving amplitudes for elastic and resonance form factors , have shown that at momentum transfers approaching 6  the approach to pqcd is not manifest .",
    "the recent evolution of the theoretical formalism of generalized parton distributions  @xcite ( gpd s ) has shown promise of providing a framework for describing exclusive reactions in terms of parton degrees of freedom without invoking the internal hard mechanisms of valence pqcd .",
    "the gpd description has been discussed primarily in the reactions involving deeply virtual compton scattering and meson production , at as high  and small @xmath0 as possible .",
    "this is the kinematic region in which it has been shown that the reaction mechanism can be factorized into a hard perturbative , and soft non - perturbative part  @xcite , the so - called _ handbag _ process illustrated in fig .",
    "[ handbag ] .",
    "the soft handbag is characterized by gpd s which contain information about the distribution of quarks in the hadron . in particular , they give the amplitude that a quark with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath7 , in a hadron with momentum @xmath8 , can be given a momentum kick @xmath9 with sideways component @xmath10 , and re - absorbed by the hadron which emerges with a momentum @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ handbag]-top ) . typically , hard electroproduction processes also require a longitudinal momentum transfer , characterized by a skewedness parameter @xmath12 . in the limit",
    "@xmath13 the certain gpd s become identical with the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions , while others are not accessible in dis .",
    "a very important property of the gpd s are sum rules which directly relate moments of the gpd s to various hadronic form factors .",
    "for example , electron scattering form factors are the 0th moments of the gpd s .    for elastic scattering    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 signifies both quark and anti - quark flavors .",
    "we work in a reference frame in which the total momentum transfer is transverse so that @xmath17=0 , and denote @xmath18 ,  @xmath19 , etc .    for compton scattering @xmath20 , and the appropriate",
    "_ form factor - like _ quantities  @xcite are the -1th moments of the gpd s    @xmath21    @xmath22    resonance transition form factors access components of the gpd s which are not accessed in elastic scattering or wacs .",
    "the @xmath3 form factors are related to isovector components of the gpd s  @xcite .",
    "@xmath23    where @xmath4 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are magnetic , electric and coulomb transition form factors  @xcite , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are axial ( isovector ) gpd s , which can be related to elastic gpd s in the large @xmath29 limit through isospin rotations .",
    "similar relationships can be obtained for the @xmath30 and other transitions .",
    "the gpd s as functions of @xmath7 give the contributions to the form factors due to quarks of flavor @xmath16 having momentum fraction @xmath7 . as a function of @xmath0",
    "they are directly related to the perpendicular momentum distribution of partons in the hadron wave function in ways which are inaccessible to dis .",
    "the fourier transforms of the gpd s over @xmath10 give the transverse impact parameter distributions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , at high @xmath31 the resulting baryon form factors are strongly related to the high momentum components of the valence quark distribution amplitudes .",
    "this is illustrated in the following sections , in which a simple _ ad hoc _ power behavior of the high @xmath32 of the quark distribution is used .",
    "the following is based on the development by radyushkin  @xcite , who calculated the proton helicity conserving form factor , @xmath1 , assuming that the handbag can be expressed as an effectively two - body process , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ twobody ] .",

    "reference  @xcite have also evaluated wide angle compton scattering , and find the higher fock components contribute an even more significant fraction of the form factors ( @xmath105 ) than in elastic scattering , especially at lower @xmath31 , as may be expected .",

    "the decrease in @xmath115 relative to @xmath116 indicates that the transition form factor is softer than that for elastic scattering .",
    "the soft part of the transition form factor can be modeled by assuming a different @xmath36 parameter for @xmath117 than @xmath118 .",

    "this also implies that the mean transition radius for the @xmath3 transition is also larger than for proton elastic scattering .",
    "the advent of the gpd formalism offers a framework to model the @xmath32 distributions of quarks which are involved in exclusive reactions .",
    "these distributions are constrained by providing simultaneous fits to several different reactions rather than by fitting form factors for a single specific reaction .",
    "furthermore , specific reactions may be sensitive to specific components of gpd .",
    "for example the @xmath106 is selective of isovector components .    within the two - body framework presented , high  ( or@xmath31 ) form factors are sensitive to the high momentum components of the underlying wave functions .",
