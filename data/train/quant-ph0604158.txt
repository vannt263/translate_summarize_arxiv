    "bose - einstein condensates form one of the main topics of research at the moment .",
    "one reason for this enormous interest is the fact that they combine concepts and techniques from different areas of physics , such as quantum optics , condensed matter physics , molecular physics and quantum chaos . on the experimental side ,",
    "there has been a remarkable progress in confining and manipulating bose - einstein condensates @xcite , which has stimulated the theoretical research in the area .",
    "there has been a large number of previous studies analyzing the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates in a double well potential using a mean - field approach , the gross - pitaevskii equation . in @xcite smerzi _",
    "et  al . _",
    "discussed the occurrence of macroscopic self - trapping within one well .",
    "the behavior of the system during an adiabatic change of parameters was studied in @xcite and generalizations of the linear two level crossing scenarios and the landau - zener formula were analyzed .",
    "another line of investigation considers the mesoscopic regime in which the quantum and the classical , i.e.  mean - field descriptions overlap and therefore semiclassical techniques can be used to study the system @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a semiclassical technique to analyze the spectral properties of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this method has already been used to describe the vibrational spectra of molecules @xcite and provides an intuitive picture for the at first sight uninterpretable spectra . in this sense , the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate in a triple well potential is analogous to the vibrations of a tri - atomic molecule . using the geometrical language of classical mechanics to describe the quantum system ,",
    "we introduce a simple semiclassical method of visualization and classification of the quantum eigenstates which allows a characterization of the dynamics of the system .",
    "furthermore , we investigate how far the correspondence between the mean - field system and the quantum many body system can be extended when the number of particles decreases .    for our studies",
    "we consider a bose - einstein condensate in a triple well potential , since the technique easily allows us to go beyond the standard double well potential analysis .",
    "a triple well potential has a much richer structure @xcite and the power of the method can be shown without loss of clarity , still allowing a direct visualization of all relevant structures .",
    "in the following analysis we consider a system consisting of bosonic particles in an external periodic potential @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if a weak two - particle point - like interaction is assumed , then the hamiltonian in second quantization can be written as @xmath4{{\\hat{{{\\phi}}}}}(\\vec{r } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{g}{2 } \\int d^3r\\ ; { { \\hat{{{\\phi}}}}}^\\dagger(\\vec{r})\\,{{\\hat{{{\\phi}}}}}^\\dagger(\\vec{r})\\,{{\\hat{{{\\phi}}}}}(\\vec{r})\\,{{\\hat{{{\\phi}}}}}(\\vec{r})\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 is the particle mass , @xmath6 is the coupling constant describing two - body interactions and @xmath7 is the s - wave scattering length . for a repulsive interaction ,",
    "@xmath8 is positive while for an attractive interaction @xmath8 takes a negative value . for the rest of the paper we choose scaled units with @xmath9 .",
    "the field operator @xmath10 can be expanded in terms of bosonic annihilation operators , @xmath11 where we assume that the basis functions @xmath12 of the one - particle hilbert space are exponentially localized in space and real , as is the case for the wannier functions @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath13 describes basis functions in different wells and we will take into account only three different wells in order to model the three well potential .",
    "the second index @xmath5 labels the excited states within a single well . assuming bose - einstein condensates",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to the lowest energy state @xmath14 and neglect higher excited states ( see also @xcite for a careful discussion of this topic for a two well potential ) . experimentally such a system was realized in @xcite for a two well potential but the technique can in principle also be extended to three wells .    expanding the hamiltonian in this basis and neglecting fourth order terms in the creation and annihilation operators from different basis functions ( modes ) yields the well - known bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite restricted to three wells .",
    "so , the hamiltonian can be written in a symmetrized form as @xmath15 with @xmath16 here we neglect a constant energy shift . for convenience",
    ", we will choose the nonlinear interaction strengths @xmath17 equal for each well in the following sections which is also in accordance with experimental realizations .",
    "such hamiltonians have already been studied in great detail for the more restrictive two mode model ( e.g.  in @xcite ) .    the hamiltonian commutes with the particle number operator @xmath18 which expresses the conservation of the total number of particles .",
    "the symmetrized form is more convenient when considering the semiclassical limit , as will become clear in the next paragraph .",
    "hamiltonians of this kind have been used in molecular physics in order to describe and assign vibrational spectra @xcite . in the molecular case",
    "they describe all kinds of vibrational degrees of freedom like stretches , bends , torsions etc .  and include various resonant interactions corresponding to different simple rational ratios between the frequencies . the conserved particle number in our case of eq .",
    "( [ eq - hqm ] ) corresponds to the polyad - type conserved quantities in the molecular systems .    for the case of 30 particles considered in the following",
    ", it is an easy numerical task to diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix and thus solve the problem .",
    "however , one can not understand the underlying structure of this system from numerical values alone .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a method which allows an easy visual characterization of the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , using the close correspondence with the classical system .",
    "essential for our semiclassical classification and assignment of quantum states is a comparison between the quantum states and the corresponding classical dynamics . to this end , the first step is the construction of the classical hamiltonian function , which corresponds to the quantum hamiltonian given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - hqm])([eq - hqmb ] ) .",
    "this is done by heisenberg s substitution rules @xcite @xmath19 there are two different lines of argumentation for this substitution .",
    "first , it is exact for the harmonic oscillator where the well known classical hamiltonian @xmath20 is obtained by the replacement of the symmetrized product of an annihilation and a creation operator by the classical action .",
    "this implies the correspondence @xmath21 between the classical action @xmath22 and the quantum number @xmath13 of the oscillator ( @xmath22 is here measured in units of @xmath23 ) .",
    "this correspondence of eq .",
    "( [ eq - inrel1 ] ) is also a result of the application of the semiclassical bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules to the harmonic oscillator . in more general cases we have to generalize the bohr - sommerfeld method to the ebk quantization .",
    "then the argument holds for any bound system of any number of degrees of freedom as long as the system is close to integrable ( for general background information on semiclassics see @xcite ) . in general , the semiclassical methods give results correct in the lowest two orders in @xmath23 ( orders 0 and 1 ) and cause errors of order @xmath24 .",
    "the application of the substitution rules of eq .",
    "( [ eq - airel ] ) to the quantum hamiltonian of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - hqm])([eq - hqmb ] ) gives @xmath25 a hamiltonian for the same system but expanded in another basis was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "this function can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of a classical system of three coupled anharmonic oscillators described in action - angle variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 . as a method to construct the corresponding classical hamiltonian , the substitution rules of eq .",
    "( [ eq - airel ] ) always give the correct result since in this direction ( quantum @xmath29 classical ) the correspondence is unique whenever it exist at all , in contrast to the other direction ( classical @xmath29 quantum ) with its notorious @xmath24 problems . at high excitation ( large quantum numbers )",
    "there is a second argument for the semiclassical correspondence .",
    "the application of a creation or annihilation operator to a number state @xmath30 has the effect @xmath31 in the limit of a large quantum number @xmath13 , the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath32 or @xmath33 is irrelevant in the square roots as well as in the states and the operators can simply be replaced by multiplication with the number @xmath34 .",
    "this argument holds for condensates where a large number of particles goes into a superfluid state which is well described by a mean - field limit .",
    "this is in line with the standard argument of semiclassical behavior in the limit of large quantum numbers .",
    "interestingly , for systems of coupled anharmonic oscillators the semiclassical treatment is very good also for low excitation numbers . in this limit ,",
    "we approach the integrable harmonic limit where the bohr - sommerfeld treatment gives the correct result .",
    "the experience with molecular systems of the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - hqm])([eq - hqmb ] ) shows that a semiclassical treatment of such systems is globally quite good in most cases .",
    "accordingly , we base our method of semiclassical assignment on this argument .",
    "semiclassical arguments will be used later first to convert the eigenstates of the many - body hamiltonian ( [ eq - hqm ] ) into wave functions on the toroidal configuration space and second to compare these functions with important structures seen in the classical dynamics .",
    "the integrable part @xmath35 of the hamiltonian , which does not contain interactions between the three oscillators , leaves all actions unchanged .",
    "in contrast , @xmath36 changes the values of the actions ( particles in the wells ) because of its dependence on angles and introduces interactions between the three oscillators . in this sense",
    "we call in the following @xmath36 the interaction part of the hamiltonian . in the picture of particles in the triple",
    "well , @xmath36 describes tunneling terms between the various wells .    the poisson bracket between @xmath37 and the observable @xmath38 the total action , is equal to zero , which corresponds to the quantum mechanically conserved number of particles .",
    "note that the numerical value of @xmath39 differs by @xmath40 from the value of @xmath41 because of the zero point actions .",
    "the symmetry @xmath42 can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom from three to two by a canonical transformation . using the generating function @xmath43 of the old angles @xmath44 and the new actions @xmath45 results in the transformations ( together with eq .",
    "( [ eq - kcl ] ) ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the new angles conjugate to @xmath45 .",

    "will be described in the following section .",
    "the angle variables can be introduced in the quantum system by using the set of functions @xmath52 first introduced in molecular spectroscopy by sibert and mccoy @xcite .",
    "these functions are similar to the bargmann states studied in @xcite in the context of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this relation is well - known from the context of infinite lattices .",
    "there , the sum is taken from @xmath53 to @xmath54 and corresponds to the representation of bloch functions in terms of wannier functions .",
    "the angle variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 span the brillouin zone .",
    "however , in this example these functions are not orthogonal due to the fact that for fixed @xmath41 the sum is finite , @xmath58 = \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{n_1+n_2+n_3=n } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! e^{-i(n_1(\\varphi_1-\\varphi'_1)+n_2(\\varphi_2-\\varphi'_2)+n_3(\\varphi_3-\\varphi'_3))}\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for a large particle number @xmath41 the scalar product converges to a delta - comb .",
    "there is a considerable deviation for the value of @xmath59 , which can play an important role when matrix elements are calculated .",
    "but here we use these functions only for visualization and not for further algebraic manipulations .",
    "the eigenfunctions of ( [ eq - hqm ] ) have the form @xmath60 the coefficients @xmath61 can be obtained by a numerical diagonalization in the number basis @xmath62 .",
    "the eigenstates in the angle representation ( [ eq - phirep ] ) , i.e.  the wave functions , are given by a fourier series : @xmath63 finally , we can reduce the number of degrees of freedom in this representation by using the same coordinate transformation as in the classical case of eq .",
    "( [ eq - vartrans ] ) .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath64 the global phase factor @xmath65 can be ignored in the following considerations . it must be emphasized that the sum includes only a finite number of terms due to the finite number of combinations of numbers @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 which sum to @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the fourier expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq - eigfred ] ) has only a finite resolution . for a very small value of @xmath41",
    ", this sum has just a few terms , so that only the coarse grain structure can be explored ; accordingly , the eigenfunctions @xmath69 show only diffuse structures . in our example , the configuration space of the reduced system is the two dimensional torus @xmath70 with total volume @xmath71 .",
    "the total number of basis states for a given number of particles @xmath41 is @xmath72 .",
    "accordingly , the eigenfunctions which are linear combinations of the @xmath73 basis functions can only show patterns with a resolution of the order @xmath74 in the area or a resolution of the order @xmath75 in each direction .",
    "with @xmath59 we have @xmath76 eigenstates , giving a resolution of approximately @xmath77 in each direction .    the reinterpretation of the expansion of an eigenstate into number states as a fourier series on the toroidal configuration space has the following semiclassical interpretation , where we write for the moment @xmath23 explicitly into the equations : if one naively quantizes the classical canonical variables @xmath78 using the schrdinger quantization @xmath79 = i\\hbar\\delta_{kl}$ ] , which imposes @xmath80 , then functions @xmath81 can be interpreted as wave functions in coordinate space . of course , the schrdinger quantization is correct only in cartesian coordinates and it does not commute with canonical transformations , in general yielding errors of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the results have to be interpreted semiclassically .",
    "note that due to our symmetric introduction of the quantum - classical correspondence in eq .",
    "( [ eq - inrel1 ] ) , the errors to first order in @xmath23 cancel identically . because of these considerations we call the wave function from eq .",
    "( [ eq - eigfred ] ) the _ semiclassical wave function_.    in many semiclassical investigations , husimi functions are used to relate quantum wave functions of eigenstates to structures in the classical phase space .",
    "this is the appropriate and natural procedure if the usual position and momentum coordinates are used .",
    "it is less clear and in addition not necessary in our case where the whole dynamics is treated in action - angle variables .",
    "let us explain this point in some detail : the description of the system by a hamiltonian of the functional structure of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - hqm])([eq - hqmb ] ) in the quantum case or eq .",
    "( [ eq - hcl ] ) in the classical case only makes sense for bound systems , it is not appropriate to describe scattering systems",
    ". therefore we restrict the following discussion to bound states only . for any bound eigenstate in the standard position space",
    ", there must be the same amount of wave running in one direction and in the opposite direction , otherwise it would not be a bound stationary state .",
    "accordingly , the wave function can be chosen real .",
    "the phases of the wave function do not play any important role and do not help for the classification of the states .",
    "the canonically conjugate momenta have continuous values and wigner or husimi functions are defined without any problem on the classical phase space and indicate in many cases to which structure in the classical phase space some particular quantum state belongs .",
    "the situation is very different in action angle variables . here",
    "the configuration space is a torus with its very different global topology .",
    "this causes great difficulties to define the usual wigner or husimi functions .",
    "because of the periodicity of the configuration coordinates , the corresponding canonically conjugate variables ( here the actions ) only have discrete values in the quantum dynamics .",
    "this makes it very tricky to convert the wave function into something defined on the continuous classical phase space . on the other hand",
    ", we do not really need to do this , since we have the following simpler method to squeeze out of the wave functions information on the classical actions .",
    "waves propagating in one direction on a torus always return to the starting point .",
    "accordingly , wave functions for a bound state can have  and in fact in most cases do have ",
    "strong running wave contributions and the phase of the function is essential and will be analyzed to help in the classification of the state . in a semiclassical spirit",
    "the phase of a wave function can be interpreted as a classical action integral and accordingly the gradient of the phase function gives the value of the canonically conjugate momentum which in this case is the action .",
    "if there is a sufficiently large patch of configuration space where the phase function comes close to a plane wave , then its gradient indicates the value of the actions which is represented by this part of the wave function .",
    "this provides a kind of lift of the wave function from configuration space into phase space .",
    "if there are closed loops on the torus along which the phase function is very regular ( and this usually happens along density crests which run along the classical organizing center as will be explained in detail in section  [ sec - semiclass ] ) then we interpret this as representing a motion of almost constant action along this loop .",
    "this idea is used to get longitudinal quantum numbers introduced in section  [ sec - semiclass ] .",
    "before we relate individual quantum states to guiding centers of the classical dynamics , we must get an overview of the classical dynamics and its skeleton . as an example , we discuss the classical dynamics for @xmath59 , i.e.  for the value @xmath82 of the classically conserved total action @xmath39 . in the following ,",
    "we choose parameter values @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which lead to a quantum mechanical energy interval of @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the classical reduced system exists in the energy interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we measure all energies with respect to the quantum mechanical ground state of @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - hqm ] ) , i.e.  we subtract the quantum mechanical zero point @xmath89 from the classical energies in order to facilitate the comparison between classical and quantum dynamics . to represent the classical dynamics graphically",
    ", we show poincar sections in planes @xmath90 with positive orientation @xmath91 .",
    "if an initial condition @xmath92 is chosen in the poincar section , then we first have to reconstruct the four corresponding coordinates in the phase space in order to start a trajectory of the flow through this point .",
    "the two coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath93 coincide with the given coordinates in the domain of the poincar map .",
    "the coordinate @xmath50 is obtained by the intersection condition and the remaining coordinate @xmath94 is calculated by an inversion of the hamiltonian function  ( [ eq - hclred ] ) with respect to the coordinate @xmath94 for a fixed value of the energy and for the known values of the other three coordinates .",
    "here some care is necessary since this inverse function is multivalued .",
    "first we fix one orientation of the domain , i.e. we always search for solutions with @xmath95 . in principle",
    "there can be several solutions with the same orientation and then it is necessary to ensure that all initial points used belong to the same branch .",
    "poincar sections in planes @xmath96 look very similar to the ones in planes @xmath97 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to sections in @xmath90 only .",
    "if the whole dynamics were governed by @xmath35 , then all actions would be constants of motion and all poincar sections would be foliated by invariant lines @xmath98 . including the interaction @xmath36 between the wells ( modes ) into the dynamics has the following effects . in regions of the phase space , where none of the resonances contained in @xmath36",
    "has an important effect , the dynamics is in the kam regime ( see the extensive discussion of soft chaos in chapter 9 of @xcite ) and a large fraction of the phase space volume is still filled by invariant lines , which are continuous deformations of the invariant surfaces @xmath99 of the unperturbed @xmath35 dynamics .",
    "we call such invariant surfaces primary tori .",
    "this happens mainly in regions of phase space where the effective frequencies @xmath100 are far from simple rational ratios , for which there is a corresponding resonance coupling in @xmath36 , as explained in the next paragraph . for our particular choice of coupling terms in @xmath36 ,",
    "only 1:1 resonances are relevant .",
    "the effect of the coupling terms between the different modes can be described in the following way .",
    "each term contains a cosine function whose argument is a difference between angles of the original degrees of freedom or one angle of the reduced system , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq - hcl ] ) and ( [ eq - hclred ] ) .",
    "because in our special case the arguments are differences of two angles with the same weight , we say that these terms describe 1:1 resonant interactions between the two degrees of freedom .",
    "the right hand sides of the hamiltonian equations of motion ( [ eq - diffhama ] ) and ( [ eq - diffhamb ] ) for the angles @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) of the reduced system , @xmath103 contain two contributions .",
    "the first consists of the difference of two effective frequencies from eq .",
    "( [ eq - omegaeff ] ) , and the second is the derivative of the coupling terms with respect to the action , which contains cosine functions . first , let us assume that we change some parameter , e.g.  @xmath104 , to see how coupling sets in .",
    "further we assume that the difference between the effective frequencies , i.e. the angle independent term on the right hand side , is different from zero .",
    "let us say it has the value @xmath105 .",
    "for a small value of @xmath104 the angle dependent terms are not able to cancel @xmath106 regardless of the value of the angles . the angle dependent terms have the maximal absolute value for angle values @xmath107 and @xmath108 because of the dependence on cosine functions .",
    "when @xmath104 increases , then at one point it reaches a value , where the angle dependent terms are just able to cancel @xmath106 .",
    "then the angle @xmath101 of the reduced system stops , @xmath109 , and we call this _ frequency locking_. this necessarily happens for angle values where the cosine functions have maximal absolute value , i.e. where the angles are 0 or @xmath108 . whether the appropriate angle values are 0 or @xmath108 depends on the signs of @xmath106 and of the terms in front of the cosine functions .",
    "when the value of @xmath104 is further increased , then there is a whole interval of angle values where locking is possible .",
    "the actual dynamics of the locked motion then performs small oscillations around the angle values 0 or @xmath108 .",
    "this will be seen in the numerical results of the classical dynamics . in the quantum dynamics",
    "the fluctuations around the coupling point of the angles are quantized and give rise to a discrete set of transversal quantum numbers , see section iv .",
    "if only one of these resonant couplings is strong , then the dynamics is still close to integrable , and a large part of the phase space volume is filled by invariant tori , which show up as invariant lines in the poincar sections .",
    "however , due to the rearrangement of phase space structures by the resonant coupling , the invariant surfaces in phase space are no longer primary tori , i.e.  are no longer continuous deformations of invariant surfaces of the @xmath35 dynamics .",
    "large bundles of secondary tori appear which are organized around periodic orbits ( in this case stable , elliptic ) representing the _ guiding centers _ for the new nonlinear modes",
    ". there are also corresponding unstable periodic orbits , which in the integrable case are represented by separatrix crossings in poincar sections . in the nonintegrable cases , the separatrices break and turn into homoclinic tangles , which become the central structures of chaotic strips .",
    "however , if only one resonant coupling has a strong effect and the others are not important , then the chaos strips are very thin and they still appear almost like separatrices .",
    "if two or more linearly independent resonant couplings are strong , then chaos on large scales can appear .",
    "these regions in phase space are resonance overlap zones @xcite .",
    "however , also in strongly chaotic regions of phase space there are still simple short periodic orbits ( in this case unstable , normal hyperbolic or inverse hyperbolic ) which act as guiding centers of the flow .",
    "then the dynamics is chaotic but nevertheless the flow follows some guiding center on the average .",
    "this average flow is relevant for the comparison with quantum dynamics .",
    "thus , also in the classically chaotic case we may find surprisingly simple and clean structures in a large part of the quantum wave functions .",
    "in such cases it can be appropriate to imagine simple idealized classical guiding centers and interpret the quantum states as quantum excitations of these idealized structures .",
    "let us give a short estimate of the size of structures which are relevant for our semiclassical considerations .",
    "the range of action values is limited between 0 and @xmath39 due to eq .",
    "( [ eq - kcl ] ) , the angle can vary over an interval of length @xmath110 . for each particular plot",
    "only a part of this range is energetically accessible in reality . accordingly",
    "the size of the poincar section is limited by @xmath111 . for semiclassical investigations structures of a size of @xmath23 or larger",
    "are relevant .",
    "we always use units in which @xmath23 has the numerical value 1 and also the values of all actions should be interpreted as being given in units of @xmath23 . therefore structures in our poincare plots are of interest in the following , if their size is at least in the order of one unit of action or has a relative size of @xmath112 compared to the size of the maximally possible domain of the map .",
    "we perform almost all our calculations for the reduced system . on the other hand ,",
    "the real object of interest is the original system of particles in three wells .",
    "therefore we need a fast and easy method to transfer statements about the reduced system into the corresponding statements about the original system .",
    "we have called this procedure the _ lift _ in the previous work on molecular systems @xcite .",
    "let us assume a trajectory of the reduced system is given and we want to reconstruct the corresponding trajectory of the original system .",
    "the first step of the procedure is the reconstruction of the cyclic angle .",
    "it is done rigorously by using the hamiltonian equation of motion @xmath113 the right hand side of this equation does not depend on @xmath114 but only on the known values of the other coordinates as function of time .",
    "accordingly we get @xmath115 by a simple integration with respect to time .",
    "the experience with the molecular systems has shown that normally it is sufficient to approximate @xmath115 by @xmath116 times a constant effective frequency . in our case",
    "@xmath114 is the only fast variable of the whole system and describes a fast oscillation superimposed on the motion of the whole system .",
    "the initial value @xmath117 is rather irrelevant .",
    "in contrast , the variables of the reduced system are slow variables describing the relative motion between the various degrees of freedom of the original system .",
    "the next step of the lift procedure is to undo the canonical transformation and to go back to the coordinates of the original system . in this second step",
    "the advantage of choosing the new actions equal to some of the old actions becomes evident .",
    "the knowledge of the actions in the reduced system and of the constant value of @xmath39 gives immediately the values of the old actions , i.e.  the values of the particle numbers in the three wells .",
    "because of this simple connection between the actions of the reduced system and the actions of the original system we will switch very freely between the reduced and the original system in the following considerations .",
    "in our case we have in the interaction part @xmath36 of the hamiltonian 1:1 couplings between the degrees of freedom 1 and 2 and between 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "indirectly this also implies a 1:1 coupling between the degrees of freedom 1 and 3 .",
    "accordingly , we have the following coupling schemes :     the classical reduced system for energy @xmath118 . ( a ) poincar plot in the plane @xmath90 for variables @xmath51 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 fixed by energy conservation .",

    "these different types of motion belonging to the various guiding centers , are also found in the quantum mechanical wave functions .",
    "so we used these guiding centers firstly to sort a large number of wave function into these different classes , and secondly to assign uniquely geometric quantum numbers to the wave functions within one class . in this geometric picture , the wave functions describe the quantum excitations of the underlying classical dynamics .",
