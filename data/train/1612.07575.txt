    "one of the most fascinating properties of topological insulators ( ti ) is the helical nature of their edge states , namely the locking of the propagation direction to the spin orientation  [ ] , which makes them a promising platform for spintronics applications  [ ] . in this respect ,",
    "an exciting perspective is the possibility to photoexcite spin - polarised electron wave packets by coupling the edge states to an external electromagnetic radiation .",
    "notably , the very helicity of the edge states , which is closely related to their massless dirac fermions behavior , prevents electron photoexcitation via the customary vertical electric dipole transitions that occur in optoelectronics of conventional semiconductors . to overcome this problem ,",
    "strategies have been proposed , particularly for two - dimensional time - reversal symmetric tis , i.e. quantum spin hall ( qsh ) systems  [ ] .",
    "a circularly polarised radiation , for instance , can induce magnetic dipole transitions via zeeman coupling to the edge states  [ ] .",
    "its efficiency , however , is limited by the @xmath1-factor .",
    "alternatively , exploiting frequencies that exceed the bulk gap , optical transitions can be induced from the edge states to the bulk states  [ , ] , which , however , are not topologically protected .",
    "quite recently it has been shown that , when an electromagnetic field is applied on a spatially localised region and for a finite time , electron photoexcitation consisting of purely intra - branch transitions can be induced on the edge states without invoking the bulk states or the zeeman coupling  [ ] .",
    "localised electromagnetic pulses can be generated either by near field spectroscopy  [ ] , or by thin metallic electrodes coupled to a qsh edge and biased by a time - dependent voltage  @xmath2  [ ] . as a result of the localised photoexcitation process , spin - polarised electron wave packets",
    "are thus predicted to propagate along the edge , maintaining their shape without dispersion  [ ] .    however , an important aspect of the wave packet photoexcitation and propagation process has not been discussed so far , namely the interplay between the electromagnetic radiation and the rashba interaction along the edge . the rashba interaction , which couples electrons of opposite spins and momenta , is due to a local inversion asymmetry originating by mainly two mechanisms . on the one side it may be the result of accidental disorder , caused for instance by the random ion distribution in the heterostructure doping layers or by the presence of random bonds at the quantum well interfaces , e.g. due to the etching process  [ , ] . on the other hand , local strain and rashba interaction can be generated by deforming the curvature of the geometrical boundaries  [ ] , or by applying an electric field to metallic gate electrodes  [ ] . in these cases",
    ", it may be significantly strong and can not be treated as a weak perturbation .",
    "it is worth stressing that the rashba interaction no matter how strong can not lead , alone , to any electron backscattering .",
    "this is because it is an elastic process that preserves time - reversal symmetry .",
    "such topological protection argument , however , can not be invoked in the presence of inelastic and/or time - reversal breaking processes .",
    "when rashba interaction interplays with electron - phonon  [ ] or with electron - electron interaction  [ ] , for instance , electron backscattering can arise in the edge states .",
    "in this paper we focus on the helical edge states of a two - dimensional ti , and investigate non - perturbatively the interplay between rashba interaction and the electromagnetic field , which induces inelastic and time - reversal breaking processes .",
    "we show that , via an appropriate rotation of the electron field operator into a local chiral basis , the problem can be recast into a massless dirac fermion dynamics , characterised by an inhomogeneous velocity .",
    "this mapping enables us to obtain exact expressions for the dynamical evolution of photoexcited electron wave packets , unveiling two important features . in the first instance",
    ", no backscattering arises as long as electron - electron interaction can be neglected , despite the inelastic scattering and the break up of time reversal symmetry due to the electromagnetic field .",
    "secondly , the velocity renormalised by the rashba interaction turns out to be always increased with respect to the bare fermi velocity @xmath0 , regardless of the sign and magnitude of the rashba interaction .",
    "this entails interesting consequences for the electron photoexcitation problem .",
    "in particular , when the electromagnetic field is localised away from the rashba coupling region , the rashba region effectively acts a `` superluminal gate '' : the photoexcited wave packet reaching the rashba region is boosted to space - time regions lying outside the light - cone determined by @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , when the electromagnetic field overlaps the rashba region , the photoexcited wave packets emerging from it are squeezed and their shape depends on the overlap with the applied electromagnetic pulse .",
    "these results suggest that the rashba interaction , often regarded to as an unwanted disorder effect , can be exploited also as a useful tool to tailor the shape and the propagation timescale of photoexcited wave packets .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model and its mapping into a model of dirac electrons with an inhomogeneous velocity . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the effects of the rashba interaction , showing the behavior of the electron wave function impinging on a rashba region . in sec .",
    "iv we include the electromagnetic field and explicitly provide the solution of the full problem , with a focus on the photoexcited electron densities and the chiral anomaly due to rashba interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec-5 ] we apply the general results previously obtained to the specific example of a gaussian electric pulse applied in the presence of a rashba barrier , analyzing in detail various situations , from the case where the photoexcitation occurs away from the rashba interaction to the case where an overlap exists . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec-6 ] we discuss the effects of zeeman coupling and electron - electron interaction , considering both intra - spin and inter - spin density - density coupling and specifying the conditions under which the topological protection is robust . after outlining some possible experimental realisation setups",

    "this explains the origin of the term `` chiral '' and the reason for considering @xmath53 as the `` natural basis '' for rashba - coupled states .",
    "secondly , when the electromagnetic field is switched on , inelastic and time - reversal breaking processes are induced , and @xmath50 modify their character of right- and left - movers .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical decoupling of @xmath50 , encoded in the diagonal structure of eq.([hchi ] ) , shows that no backscattering arises . in the following sections we shall analyze in detail these aspects",

    "<S> the effects of rashba interaction and electromagnetic field on the edge states of a two - dimensional topological insulator are investigated in a non - perturbative way . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electron dynamics is equivalent to a problem of massless dirac fermions propagating with an inhomogeneous velocity , enhanced by the rashba profile with respect to the bare fermi value @xmath0 . despite the inelastic and time - reversal breaking processes induced by the electromagnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , no backscattering occurs without interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the photoexcited electron densities are explicitly obtained in terms of the electric field and the rashba interaction , and are shown to fulfil generalised chiral anomaly equations . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a gaussian electromagnetic pulse is analysed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> when the photoexcitation occurs far from the rashba region , the latter effectively acts as a `` superluminal gate '' boosting the photoexcited wavepacket outside the light - cone determined by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for an electric pulse overlapping the rashba region the emerging wavepackets are squeezed in a manner that depends on the overlap area . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - electron interaction effects are also discussed , for both intra - spin and inter - spin density - density coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that rashba interaction , often considered as an unwanted disorder effect , may be exploited to tailor the shape and the propagation time of photoexcited spin - polarised wave packets . </S>"
