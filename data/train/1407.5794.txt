    "since their discovery@xcite in 1986 , high - temperature  ( high-@xmath1 ) superconductors remain one of the most interesting fields of research in modern condensed - matter physics . in particular , the origin of the pseudogap ( pg ) phase , appearing below a temperature @xmath2 of the order of a few @xmath3 , remains one of their most enduring mysteries .",
    "the field has revived recently through a number of spectacular experimental findings,@xcite which all give evidence to the presence of charge patterns inside the pg phase .",
    "understanding the properties of these charge - ordered phases , competing or coexisting with superconductivity ( sc ) , may significantly help to clarify the physical origin of the pg phase .    while a stripe order combining both charge and spin modulations first predicted theoretically in refs",
    ".   has been known for a long time to exist in la - compounds,@xcite the first observation of a modulated structure in bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( bscco ) was reported only in 2002 by j.  hoffman _ _ et al.__@xcite who subtracted the scanning tunneling microscope  ( stm ) response with and without an applied magnetic field and thus unearthed a checkerboard charge order inside the vortex cores . at the time , it was still interpreted in terms of the stripes similar to those la - compounds .",
    "it was found that the radius of the region where this order appears is larger than the radius of the vortex cores .",
    "the close connection between the development of an ordered state and the formation of vortices due to an applied magnetic field has been confirmed by a number of experiments.@xcite it has recently become clear that the high-@xmath6 compounds of bscco and yba@xmath4cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( ybco ) feature a checkerboard - type charge modulation with wave vectors along the bonds of the cuo lattice.@xcite    further , it is well known that under application of a strong magnetic field exceeding @xmath9 t , a striking reconfiguration of the fermi surface is observed.@xcite after an intense debate , a consensus emerged in which the reconfiguration of the fermi surface is attributed to ordering in the charge sector with precisely the same wave vector as the one observed in stm and x - rays.@xcite(there is no ordering in the spin sector . ) signatures of charge order have also been seen in magnetic fields above @xmath10 t in sound propagation experiments.@xcite    recent nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments on the cuprate ybco inside the ( hole ) doping region @xmath11 for the vortex state showed a charge modulation in the core of the vortices.@xcite on the other hand , the authors of ref .   studied ybco in a magnetic field at hole doping @xmath12 using the high energy x - ray scattering technique .",
    "they found the charge order not only in the pseudogap phase below an ordering temperature @xmath13 , but also in the superconducting state with the maximum magnitude of the charge density wave ( cdw ) at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , below @xmath1 the lattice modulation peak intensity grows linearly as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "we can conclude from all these experiments that a charge - order state competes with the superconducting state in high-@xmath1 cuprates and appears or is enhanced by a moderate magnetic field destroying or suppressing the superconductivity .",
    "recently , several of us have suggested to describe this competition between @xmath14-wave superconductivity and charge order in terms of a two dimensional @xmath15 symmetric nonlinear @xmath16-model.@xcite the components of the unit vectors represent fluctuating order parameters for superconductivity and a charge - modulated state . in this theory ,",
    "the pg state is a fluctuating composite state made of superconducting and charge suborders corresponding to the disordered phase of the @xmath16-model .",
    "the magnetic field can naturally be taken into account within this @xmath16-model , and the competition between superconductivity and charge order can be explained and described using a renormalization - group scheme.@xcite the results obtained in such a study are in good agreement with the results of the experiment on sound propagation.@xcite    the @xmath16-model approach of refs .   and",
    "was further developed by l. hayward _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite who studied an @xmath17 symmetric @xmath0-model that is identical to the @xmath15 model if the superconducting phases of the two @xmath18 sectors are interlocked . comparing the results of a monte - carlo simulation based on this @xmath0-model with experimental data on x - ray scattering , they reproduced the observed temperature dependency of the charge - order signal .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath16-model of ref .   has been derived starting from the so - called spin - fermion model.@xcite the charge order produced by this approach has been identified as a quadrupole density wave  ( qdw ) with modulation vectors directed along the diagonals of the cuo lattice .",
    "the instability toward the charge modulation with this symmetry had been discussed earlier@xcite under the name valence bond solid . however ,",
    "the fact that experiments so far see a primary charge order along the cuo bonds has been troubling theoreticians for years .    the cdw order with the modulation vectors directed along the bonds has been addressed by us in another publication@xcite followed by several other proposals.@xcite in ref .  , the cdw order is considered as a corollary attribute of the qdw / sc order , co - existing with it in the pg phase for @xmath19 or in a strong magnetic field inside the superconducting phase .",
    "the cdw is only a by - product of the sc / qdw order , induced by superconducting fluctuations , so that the shape of the transition lines in the @xmath20-@xmath21 phase diagram , or the structure of the vortices , is determined by the competition between the sc and qdw suborders inside the pg phase .    due to its unusual structure",
    ", it is not easy to observe the qdw order directly using non - resonant x - ray scattering . at the same time",
    ", the x - ray scattering may get a weaker signal from the secondary cdw order , and one can speak of studying the sc / qdw competition using the x - ray technique . for a @xmath0-model description of the competition between sc and the experimentally observed cdw , x - ray scattering would probe this competition directly .",
    "+ in this work we use the nonlinear @xmath0-model@xcite to investigate the structure of a quantum vortex in the superconducting phase of a high-@xmath1 superconductor .",
    "previous works concentrated on general properties of the phase diagram without magnetic fields@xcite or the transition from a uniform superconducting state into a uniform charge - ordered state under the influence of a strong magnetic field.@xcite the properties of the vortex phase itself have remained an open question and are addressed by this work .",
    "we do not try to clarify the nature of the charge order here , assuming that it can be probed by different methods including x - ray scattering and stm spectroscopy .    for this purpose ,",
    "we use the generalization of the nonlinear @xmath0-model with a magnetic field introduced in ref .  .",
    "based on this model , we derive equations for the order parameter describing a quantum vortex carrying one magnetic flux quantum . we show that the symmetry of this order parameter leads to charge ordering inside the vortex core .    in a second step ,",
    "we argue that this order is visible in x - ray scattering experiments by contributing to satellite peaks close to the standard bragg peaks .",
    "finally , the position of this satellites allows us to distinguish between the different types of charge ordered states , qdw or cdw .",
    "we show that the modulation peak intensity should be proportional to the magnetic field , which is in agreement with the results of the experiment.@xcite",

    "although the direct derivation leads to superconductivity competing with the qdw , the final equations can phenomenologically also be used for other types of charge order .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , an additional charge order may be bound to the qdw , which allows one to observe the latter indirectly by , e.g. , an x - ray technique .",
    "thus , we consider explicitly the model with the sc / qdw composite order parameter as in refs .   but having in mind also some broader applications , when discussing the symmetry of the charge order .",
    "the order parameter may be represented in the form of an @xmath29 unitary matrix in the particle - hole ( gorkov - nambu ) space , @xmath30by unitarity , the parameters for the superconducting and charge orders , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are subject to the nonlinear constraint @xmath33 .",

    "we note that the qdw only contributes to `` odd '' bragg peaks , i.e. where the sum of the two integers  @xmath177 and  @xmath178 in the reciprocal - lattice vector @xmath179 is odd .",
    "since qdw order thus grants a signal only at the edge of the first brillouin zone , its observation will probably be a challenge .",
    "finally , let us examine the regime above @xmath180 where many vortices appear and the vortices form a lattice .",
    "the calculation is straightforward ; every vortex has a similar structure to the single vortex .",
    "the number of vortices must be proportional to the applied magnetic field @xmath181 , and we are interested in the evolution of the scattering intensity of a charge - order peak .",
    "the numerical solution is obtained by calculation of the integrated intensity for a given number of vortices , which are well separated by using eq .",
    "[ iq ] , and integration of this result over the wave vectors close to the peak .",
    "this procedure results in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , revealing that the integrated intensity is proportional to the number of vortices , where the number of vortices is in turn proportional to the applied magnetic field .",
    "thus , @xmath182 .",
    "this result is in agreement with a recent experimental work.@xcite    the authors of this study performed a hard - x - ray experiment and found satellites to the @xmath183 and @xmath184 bragg peaks that were interpreted as a result of the formation of cdw order in the cuo planes . at zero field ,",
    "the charge order emerges by cooling the system below a critical temperature @xmath185k .",
    "the situation at zero field suggests that this charge signal is a consequence of the coexistence between superconductivity and charge density wave order .",
    "this is in line with our theoretical finding in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , the increase of the signal strength by applying the magnetic field can be attributed to the formation of vortices in the cuo plane . outside the vortices",
    ", superconductivity suppresses the charge order and a field - independent signal is obtained . inside the vortices , there are regions that are purely charge - ordered , further enhancing the signal . increasing the magnetic field",
    "allows more vortices to penetrate the sample and thus leads to a stronger signal .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) of ref .  .",
    "remarkably , the increase is a linear function of the applied magnetic field , as suggested .    further evidence for charge order inside vortex cores was found in refs .",
    "the authors of ref .   found a charge - order signal by means of nmr measurement inside the superconducting phase when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "for fixed temperature , the order starts to give a signal above some threshold field @xmath186 . whether the order is uni- or bidirectional was not specified and therefore it is not completely clear which kind of charge order emerges there , but the appearance of charge order in the vortex phase confirms our theoretical finding .",
    "a similar scenario applies to ref .  , where charge order in the vortices was found in an stm experiment .",
    "it was verified that the order has checkerboard symmetry and therefore fits nicely into our theoretical findings .",
    "the @xmath0-model description@xcite for the pseudogap in the high-@xmath6 cuprates leads to vortices whose geometry may differ from the conventional ginzburg - landau picture .",
    "the main difference , however , is the onset of charge order in the vortex core , where the superconducting order parameter turns to zero .",
    "this gives rise to peaks in the density - density structure factor and explains the cdw signals seen in x - ray experiments.@xcite we hope that future experimental works will soon clarify the theoretically troubling issue of charge - order x - ray peaks along the diagonal of the brillouin zone .",
