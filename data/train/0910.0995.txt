    "double - pionic fusion has been an intriguing reaction all the time since abashian , booth and crowe@xcite discovered the so - called abc effect nearly 50 years ago .",
    "the abc effect stands for an unexpected low - mass enhancement in the spectrum of the invariant @xmath3 masses @xmath6 . it is named after",
    "the initials of the authors of the first publications on this effect observed in the double pionic fusion of deuterons and protons to @xmath7he .",
    "follow - up experiments @xcite revealed this effect to show up in cases , when the two - pion production process leads to a bound nuclear system .",
    "since the effect was not observed in @xmath8h@xmath2 data @xcite , this finding has been taken as evidence that the abc effect might be restricted to the scalar - isoscalar @xmath3 channel ( @xmath9 channel ) . with the exception of low - statistics bubble - chamber measurements",
    "all early experiments conducted on this issue have been inclusive measurements carried out preferentially with single - arm magnetic spectrographs for the detection of the fused nuclei .",
    "[ t ]    -channel @xmath5 excitation in the intermediate state .",
    ", scaledwidth=20.0% ]    theoretically the abc effect has been interpreted @xcite by @xmath4-channel @xmath5 excitation in the course of the reaction process ( see fig .",
    "1 ) leading to both a low - mass and a high - mass enhancement in isoscalar @xmath6 spectra .",
    "in fact , the missing momentum spectra from inclusive measurements have been in support of such predictions .",
    "however , recent exclusive measurements of the isoscalar double - pionic fusion reactions @xmath10 , @xmath8he@xmath3 and @xmath11he@xmath3 @xcite covering practically the full reaction phase space exhibit no significant high - mass enhancement , only a very pronounced low - mass enhancement . also the new data on the most basic double - pionic fusion reaction for the abc effect  the reaction @xmath12  point to an isoscalar @xmath13-channel resonance as origin of the abc - effect , which couples to @xmath14 and @xmath5 channels , has a mass of about 90 mev below the nominal @xmath5 threshold of @xmath15 and a width of only @xmath16 50 mev @xcite .",
    "the latter is much smaller than that expected from a conventional @xmath5 system , which has a width of about twice the @xmath17 width .",
    "i.e. @xmath16 230 mev .",
    "if this interpretation is true , then double - pionic fusion leading to isovector final states is not expected to exhibit the abc - effect .",
    "rather one expects agreement with the conventional @xmath5 t - channel excitation ( fig .",
    "1 ) . also since due to bose symmetry the isovector @xmath2 system must be in odd relative angular momentum , i. e. in practice in relative p - wave to each other , there should be no low - mass enhancement in the @xmath18 spectrum .",
    "hence the @xmath19 reaction represents an important test case both for the current understanding of the abc effect as a purely isoscalar phenomenon and for the interpretation of all other double - pionic fusion processes as a conventional @xmath4-channel @xmath5 process .",
    "we note that this mechanism by itself is of key interest , since it constitutes the basic double excitation process in the nn system .",
    "surprisingly it has not yet been tested in detail by exclusive and kinematically complete measurements . in a recent study @xcite of total cross sections of the non - fusion channels",
    "@xmath20 it has been shown that roper and @xmath5 excitations are the predominant two - pion production processes . for a detailed study of the latter",
    "the isovector @xmath3 channel is particularly favorable , since there the competing roper excitation is heavily suppressed @xcite .",
    "experiments devoted to the isovector double - pionic fusion are very sparse . for the @xmath8h@xmath2 reaction",
    "there are just two single - arm magnetic spectrometer measurements providing inclusive momentum spectra at just one or two angle settings @xcite .",
    "experimental information on the @xmath21 reaction is available solely from bubble chamber measurements @xcite of very low statistics with no information on differential observables .",
    "hence an exclusive measurement of solid statistics and covering most of the relevant phase space appears to be crucial for the most basic isovector double - pionic fusion reaction , in order to settle the issue of the abc effect in the isovector @xmath3 channel as well as to have a clear - cut test case for the conventional @xmath4-channel @xmath5 process .",
    "in order to investigate this particular issue with detailed experimental information we have carried out exclusive measurements of the @xmath21 reaction at @xmath22 = 1.1 gev , i. e. in the energy region of abc effect and @xmath5 excitation .",

    "all possible two - layer combinations have been used .",

    "acceptance and efficiency corrections have been performed with monte carlo simulations of the detector performance in an iterative procedure starting with the use of pure phase space distributions and ending with a model , which provides a satisfactory description of the data ( solid lines in figs .",

    "1 ) is described by a @xmath4-channel pion exchange followed by two @xmath17 propagators and the condition that the two nucleons are constrained in their phase space by the deuteron boundstate condition . in the isoscalar @xmath3 channel , where the abc effect shows up , the two pion - nucleon p - waves resulting from the decay of the two @xmath17s couple either to relative s - waves ( @xmath9-channel ) or d - waves between the two pions . due to bose symmetry",

    "all calculations shown in figs . 4 - 6 have been normalized in absolute scale to the observed total cross section .",
    "the observed distributions of the invariant masses @xmath46 and @xmath37 exhibit clearly the simultaneous excitation of two @xmath17 resonances .",
    "simple t - channel @xmath5 calculations without isovector - channel operator ( dotted curves in figs . 4 - 6 ) reproduce both @xmath46 and @xmath37 spectra quite well , however , not the @xmath18 spectrum , where they exhibit both a low - mass and a high - mass enhancement  _",

    "5 displays the angular distributions of @xmath30 and @xmath29 in the cm system .",
    "both distributions are compatible with isotropy and also in accordance with the @xmath4-channel predictions . since in this experiment the @xmath25 particles",
    "could be identified uniquely only in the forward detector together with the deuterons , the @xmath29 particles have been restricted by kinematics to the backward hemisphere in the cm system .",
    "hence the @xmath48 distribution is not measured over the full angular range . however",
    ", this means no loss of information , since we have identical particles in the initial channel with the consequence that the cm angular distributions have to be symmetric about 90@xmath49 .    in fig .",

    "they have been normalized in absolute scale to the data .",
    "solid and dotted curves coincide in the figure .",
    "their energy dependence is given primarily by the @xmath17 propagators , whereas the @xmath50 dependence of the reaction amplitude due to the pion double p - waves from the decay of the two @xmath17s is counteracted by the @xmath51 dependence from the pion propagator .",
    "this results in a resonance - like structure with a maximum at twice the @xmath17 mass and a width of about twice the @xmath17 width .",
    "these calculations give a good account of the experimentally observed energy dependence .",
    "in contrast , the calculation assuming the production of a real @xmath40 meson in the exit channel ( dashed curve ) is far from the experimentally observed energy dependence for @xmath52 2.5 gev .",
    "the first exclusive measurements of the double - pionic fusion reaction to an isovector @xmath3 channel provide differential cross sections , which are in good agreement with a conventional @xmath4-channel @xmath5 excitation in the intermediate state - though small contributions from other processes may not be excluded .",
    "the isovector @xmath2 channel exhibits no low - mass enhancement , _",
    "i. e. _ no abc effect , as indeed expected from the bose symmetry in the @xmath3 system , which prohibits relative s - waves between @xmath25 and @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that also the experimentally observed energy dependence of the total cross section is well reproduced by the @xmath4-channel @xmath5 process adds further confidence to the understanding of the double - pionic fusion process in isovector channels .",
    "moreover , it provides the possibility to reliably predict the expected size of the conventional @xmath4-channel @xmath5 process in the @xmath53 and @xmath10 reactions by use of isospin relations as demonstrated in ref .",
