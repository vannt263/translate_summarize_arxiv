    "@xmath5 planets have been confirmed by _",
    "kepler_. recently a new set of data has been released ( q0-q15 from mast , http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler ) .",
    "the observation duration of _ kepler _ is extended to @xmath6 day . *",
    "the number of candidates has * reached as many as @xmath7 , including @xmath8 candidates in multiple systems ( up to july , 2013 ) . due to longer observation time",
    ", more long - period candidates are found , e.g. koi-3946.01 with a period of 308.545 day .",
    "some single transiting systems are * seen * to be multiple systems when more transiting candidates are found , e.g. koi-255 .    for multi - planet systems , the interactions between planets will cause variations of their transit midtimes @xcite .",
    "kepler-9 was confirmed as a multi - planet system via transit timing variations ( ttvs ) successfully by @xcite .",
    "even non - transiting planets can be detected via ttvs @xcite .",
    "ttvs for a two - planet system will generally be anti - correlated because of conservation of energy . by recognizing such anti - correlation and computing the amplitudes of their ttvs",
    ", one can infer the mass upper limits of these candidates and therefore confirm them as planets @xcite .",
    "a series of papers have described the theory in detail by the kepler group * @xcite*. they have confirmed 48 planets in 23 systems combining the anti - correlation method and the dynamical simulation of orbital stability .",
    "@xcite also confirmed 12 planet pairs via ttvs .",
    "the masses of 3 planet pairs are exactly calculated while the mass upper limits of others are inferred via the amplitudes of their ttvs .",
    "hitherto , all the confirmed planet pairs via ttvs are with an observational time span less than @xmath9 days @xcite .",
    "although some planets with long periods can be confirmed via ttvs , e.g. kepler-30 d with a period about @xmath10 day @xcite , confirmations of these planets are less convincing and their masses are quite uncertain due to limited number of observed transits . in this paper , we utilize the recent data released on july 1st , 2013 ( q0-q15 ) . with a time span as long as 1350 day , we can search for planet pairs near the first order mmrs with long - period ttvs .",
    "their mass upper limits can be inferred via the amplitude described by @xcite .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows .",
    "we present how we obtain ttvs of * planet * candidates and describe the confirmation method in section 2 , i.e. recognizing anti - correlations , calculating false alarm probabilities ( faps ) and estimating mass limits .",
    "the properties of the 8 confirmed planets in 4 systems are listed and compared with planets confirmed via ttvs previously in section 3 .",
    "furthermore , we show the gaussian - fit masses in section 4 and compare them with current planet systems in section 5 .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section 6 .",
    "we use the _ kepler _ data in long cadence ( lc ) to calculate ttvs .",
    "we analyze all _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) flagged as  candidate \" .",
    "we can obtain the corresponding orbital parameters and stellar properties from nasa exoplanet archive ( http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu ; * ? ? ?",
    "we compute ttvs for all candidates following the steps described by @xcite . but some improvements are made .",
    "when we calculate ttvs , we cut the light curves into small segments .",
    "each segment centers around a transit midtime and has a length of four times of the transit duration . for kois with periods smaller than one month , we eliminate segments contaminated by other candidate(s ) to obtain accurate observed midtimes . for kois with periods",
    "longer than one month , the segments are inevitably easy to be contaminated due to their long transit durations . however ,",
    "if transits of different candidates in one contaminated segment are not overlapped with a distinguishable separation , we still estimate the transit midtime for each candidate .",
    "* we detrend the wings of every segment with first to third - order polynomials*. the fit with the lowest chi - square is adopted . since _",
    "kepler _ data have a high precession of @xmath4 ppm , we can verify * ttv signals * with amplitudes of several minutes .    to confirm planet pairs in a multiple system",
    ", two criterions must be satisfied .",
    "firstly they must be anti - correlated so as to infer that the two candidates are in the same system .",
    "the anti - correlation can exclude the conditions that the transits are caused by some external reasons , e.g. background eclipsing binaries or background stars transited by planets , etc . to estimate the probability that the observed anti - correlation is caused by random fluctuations",
    ", we also check the false alarm probabilities ( faps ) for candidate pairs . only with a low fap of less than @xmath0 ,",
    "the candidate pairs are considered to interact with each other reliably .",
    "secondly the physical parameters of the candidate pairs must be in acceptable ranges , especially their masses must be less than 13 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we are interested in candidate pairs near first - order mmrs , namely , the period ratio @xmath12 for each pair is around @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the periods of the inner and outer candidate .",
    "we use a normalized distance to resonance parameter @xmath16 to select out such candidate pairs .",
    "@xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 all confirmed planets via ttvs near first - order mmrs satisfy @xmath18 as shown in figure [ mmr_hist](b ) .",
    "we adopt this threshold to select candidate pairs .",
    "we check the anti - correlated periods of the adopted candidate pairs , calculate their faps and set a threshold of @xmath0 , and estimate their mass upper limits via ttv amplitudes .",
    "these steps will be described in detail in the following subsections .",
    "ttv anti - correlation can indicate the perturbations between two planets in the same system because of the conservation of energy .",
    "transit midtimes of two planets will vary simultaneously and oppositely .",
    "many multiple systems show such characteristics . the anti - correlation method has been described firstly by @xcite .",
    "we modify it by considering a linear trend mixed in long - period ttvs .",
    "when computing ttvs a simple linear fitting of transit midtimes has been applied .",
    "however it will not completely remove the secular trend of long - period ttvs . although an untreated linear trend in the ttv signal does not affect the anti - correlation tendency",
    ", it will affect ttv amplitude and cause an inaccurate estimation of mass upper limit .",
    "thus we fit ttvs for each koi using the following function : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are model parameters with test period @xmath24 .",
    "we vary @xmath24 with a wide range from 100 to 1500 * days * to get a series of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 together with their uncertainties @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . an anti - correlation parameter @xmath29 is calculated as @xmath30 where the subscripts  1 \" and  2 \" represent the two planets .",
    "the maximum value @xmath31 represents the strongest anti - correlation among all the test periods .",
    "we select out candidate pairs with strong and significant anti - correlations by ranking their @xmath32 .",
    "faps are checked for these candidate pairs .",
    "for each pair , we scramble their ttvs randomly and obtain a similar @xmath33 .",
    "we use a superscript of `` @xmath34 '' to distinguish it from @xmath31 which is obtained from the nominal data .",
    "the same process repeats @xmath35 times .",
    "the proportion of @xmath33 larger than @xmath31 represents the * expected * fap .",
    "* following the approach of @xcite * , only candidate pairs with @xmath36 are accepted @xcite .",
    "masses and free eccentricities of planet pairs near ( but not in ) first - order mmrs can be estimated via ttv amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we will estimate the mass upper limits of the accepted candidate pairs theoretically instead of simulating their stability as done by the kepler group .    for a system near @xmath13 mmr ,",
    "the amplitudes of a planet pair are @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ttv amplitude , @xmath24 is the orbital period , @xmath39 is the ratio of the candidate to the star , subscripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' represent the inner and outer candidate , g and f are laplace coefficients .    in equation ( [ eq_v1 ] ) and equation ( [ eq_v2 ] ) we have set @xmath40 to get the mass upper limit .",
    "@xmath41 is a parameter related to the complex eccentricities of the two planets .",
    "we use the model parameters corresponding to @xmath31 to calculate ttv amplitudes .",
    "resonance order can be obtained on the basis of the ratio of the periods .",
    "before we calculate the mass limit , we check the anti - correlated period @xmath42 and the theoretical synodic period @xmath43 for each pair .",
    "@xmath42 is the test period when @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath43 for a system near @xmath13 mmr is defined as @xmath45    for a multiple system with only two candidates , @xmath42 should be equal to @xmath43 under ideal conditions .",
    "however , for systems containing more than two candidates or observed ttvs with large errors , the two periods will not be exactly equal . especially for long - period candidates with * a limited number of transit measurements * , the @xmath42 will be less accurate .",
    "when we compute mass upper limits we will use @xmath43 instead of @xmath42 to avoid its large error .",
    "we confirm 8 planets in 4 koi systems .",
    "they are all near first - order mmrs , including one pair near 2:1 mmr ( koi-2672 ) and three pairs near 3:2 mmr ( koi-1236 , koi-1563 and koi-2038 ) .",

    "supposing all the planet pairs are initially located outside the 2:1 mmr , the frequent outcome of planet pairs at 2:1 and 3:2 mmr ( figure [ mmr_hist ] ) is consistent with the migration scenario .",

    "it s obvious that 75% of the planet pairs have a period ratio that are a little larger than the exact value @xmath109 .",

    "all the two - planet systems with the gaussian - fit masses are stable for at least 10 myr .",
    "we calculate the density of each planet according to their best - fit mass .",
    "planets in koi-1236 and koi-2038 system seem like rock planets while planets in koi-1563 system have a relative low density .",
    "considering the large difference between the densities of 2672.01 and 2672.02 , we infer that they formed in different regions and evolved in current orbital architecture due to migration or some other mechanisms .",
    "we also compare our new confirmed planets with other kepler planets , especially these planet pairs near mmrs . adding the new four pairs near mmrs",
    ", we find that about 36% and 30% of the planet pairs are near 2:1 and 3:2 mmr , respectively .",
    "a few more planet pairs are near 2:1 mmr than are near 3:2 mmr .",
    "if this trend continues , it is important of constraining the migrating rate of planets during the evolution of multi - planet systems @xcite . planet pairs prefer to keep an architecture that the outside planets are a little outside than the exact positions with period ratios of @xmath13 , which is consistent with @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we only consider planet pairs near first - order mmrs .",
    "additionally , planet pairs near higher order mmrs have a weaker ttv signal than planets near first - order mmrs , thus it is much harder to estimate their mass upper limits . however , the anti - correlations of their ttvs and small faps are also available to confirm these gravitational pairs .",
    "the fraction of planet pairs near high order mmrs are relatively rare , only 10 pairs are confirmed by the observation from _",
    "kepler_.    here",
    "we use the ttvs spanning up to about 1350 days .",
    "ttvs in a longer timescale can provide more information about the secular influences in planet pairs near or in mmrs @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of transiting planets or _ kepler",
    "_ candidates provide us more information about their ttvs to investigate the dynamical properties of multi - planet systems and might confirm planets with longer period in the habitable zone .",
    "we appreciate nasa and the kepler group for the great work on exoplanet detection .",
