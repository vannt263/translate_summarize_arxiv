    "showing the existence of phase transitions at low temperatures for heisenberg models is a well known difficult problem .",
    "there have been several positive results in this area over the years in both the classical and quantum cases .",
    "the first rigorous proof of a phase transition in a heisenberg model was the result of frhlich , simon and spencer @xcite for the classical heisenberg ferromagnet ( and hence for the antiferromagnet also as it is equivalent to the ferromagnet in the classical case ) .",
    "the result was later extended to the quantum antiferromagnet by dyson , lieb and simon @xcite .",
    "the case of spin-@xmath0 in dimension three was not covered , the result was extended to this case by kennedy , lieb and shastry @xcite .",
    "the result also shows long - range order for dimension two at zero temperature . in the nematic case ( also called the biquadratic interaction ) there is known to be a phase transition . in the classical system there is nematic order ( also called quadrupolar long - range order ) at low temperatures , as was shown by angelescu and zagrebnov @xcite .",
    "by contrast for the quantum case there is known to be nel order , as was recently proved in the work of ueltschi @xcite .",
    "the paper extended and combined the works of tth @xcite and aizenmann and nachtergaele @xcite who introduced probabilistic representations of some quantum heisenberg models .",
    "this work also showed the existence of nematic order in a region with an extra ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "all of these results apply in dimension at least three for positive temperature . in dimensions one and two",
    "there is the famous result of mermin and wagner @xcite that rules out a phase transition at positive temperature , this does not contradict the result for dimension two in @xcite .",
    "for the ground state there are some rigorous results , the work of tanaka , tanaka and idogaki shows long range order for an antiferromagnetic interaction accompanied by a small enough nematic ( biquadratic ) interaction in dimensions two and three . in dimension three",
    "they also show long - range order in part of the nematic region investigated in @xcite , these results were obtained independently .",
    "the aim of this article is to show that there is also a phase transition in a region with a nematic interaction accompanied by a small antiferromagnetic interaction , this result was already expected , although an explicit proof has not been presented before .",
    "curiously the result only shows the existence of nematic order , weaker than the expected antiferromagnetic order , this implies that there is further work to be done to strengthen the result to the full antiferromagnetic order . + the positive results concerning long - range order above use the method of reflection positivity in order to obtain an infrared bound , that is , a bound on the fourier transform of the correlation in question .",
    "one can then easily show that the correlation function does not decay ( for example that @xmath1 uniformly ) if the infrared bound is sufficiently strong . the infrared bound proven in @xcite allows to show a phase transition for the antiferromagnet .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this result to a model with an antiferromagnetic interaction accompanied by a small nematic ( biquadratic ) interaction .",
    "however when the nematic interaction is too large the result will no longer apply .",
    "this article will follow the approach of @xcite , starting with the nematic model , obtaining a lower bound that involves some other correlation functions .",
    "this bound can be shown to be positive for low temperatures by relating these correlations to probabilities in the random loop model introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is then easy to show ( due to reflection positivity of the antiferromagnet interaction ) that adding an antiferromagnetic interaction will maintain the positivity of the lower bound , providing the interaction is small enough .",
    "let @xmath2 . for a spin-@xmath3 model we have local hilbert spaces @xmath4 .",
    "observables are then hermitian matrices built from linear combinations of tensor products of operators on @xmath5 for some set of sites @xmath6 .",
    "physically important observables can often be expressed in terms of _ spin matrices _ @xmath7 and @xmath8 , operators on @xmath9 that are the generators of a ( 2@xmath3 + 1)-dimensional irreducible unitary representation of su(2 ) such that @xmath10=i\\sum_\\gamma\\mathcal{e}_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}s^\\gamma\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "denote @xmath13 , its magnitude is then @xmath14 .",
    "the case @xmath15 gives the pauli spin matrices . for @xmath16",
    "there are several choices for spin matrices , to make things concrete we will use the following matrices for @xmath16 : @xmath17    consider a pair @xmath18 of a lattice @xmath19 and a set of edges @xmath20 between points in @xmath6 . here",
    "we will take @xmath21 for integer @xmath22 .",
    "for the set of edges @xmath20 we take nearest - neighbour with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "then we take the operator @xmath23 for @xmath24 to be shorthand for the operator @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian of interest is general the spin-1 su(2)-invariant hamiltonian with a two - body interaction , it is known that this can be written as @xmath26 the phase diagram for this model is only partially understood .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath28 we have the heisenberg antiferromagnet that is known to undergo a phase transition at low temperatures @xcite . as the interaction when @xmath29 is reflection positive it is also possible to extend this result to @xmath29 when the ratio @xmath30 is sufficiently small",
    "the line @xmath31 has been shown to exhibit nel order for low temperatures when @xmath29 @xcite , for @xmath32 there are no rigorous results , it would be a challenging task to obtain results .",
    "the line @xmath33 is the aklt model @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is to show that there is a phase transition in this model for @xmath29 and @xmath28 with @xmath34 sufficiently small compared to @xmath35 , the statement will be made precise below .",
    "first we define the partition function and gibbs states of our model as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the quantity of interest is then the correlation @xmath38 this correlation is specifically of interest for spin-1 , in general spin - s @xmath39 will be replaced with @xmath40 .",
    "the result is then given by the following theorem .",
    "+    let @xmath16 , @xmath29 and @xmath22 be even , @xmath41 .",
    "then there exists @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that if @xmath45 and @xmath46 then @xmath47 for all @xmath22 large enough .",
    "the proof of the result will be in two steps , first the result will be proved for @xmath31 , this will be the content of the next section .",
    "second it will be shown how the result for @xmath31 extends to sufficiently small @xmath28 , this should come as no surprise as the interaction is reflection positive for @xmath28 hence adding a small interaction in this direction should not alter the result too much .",
    "we will now consider the so - called quantum nematic model @xmath29 , @xmath31 , the aim is to prove long - range order for this model using a similar approach to the proofs in @xcite . to do this",
    "we will use a representation that is an analogue of the matrix representation used in @xcite .",
    "care must be taken as now we are working with matrices rather than vectors and so commutativity becomes an issue .",
    "we introduce an external field , @xmath48 , to the hamiltonian @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the identity matrix .",
    "equilibrium states are given by @xmath51 note that the @xmath52 has been absorbed into the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "using the direct analogue of @xcite will not work here , the reason is that reflection positivity will fail as @xmath54 .",
    "all other attempts to directly obtain a matrix representation of the interaction @xmath55 have also failed , however , there is a solution .",
    "we will instead use a matrix representation of a hamiltonian that is unitarily equivalent to .    from now on we will work with the following hamiltonian @xmath56 and partition function @xmath57 similarly to before , equilibrium states are given by @xmath58",
    "if @xmath6 has a bipartite structure , @xmath59 , then if we define @xmath60 we have @xmath61 note that this leaves @xmath62 unchanged .",
    "before the theorem we introduce an integral , it is also introduced in @xcite , @xmath63^d}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon(k+\\pi)}{\\varepsilon(k)}}\\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\sum_{i=1}^d\\cos k_i\\right)_+\\mathrm{d}k,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 we have @xmath65 for @xmath66 and it can be shown that @xmath67 as @xmath68 @xcite",
    ". then we have the following result :    let @xmath16 .",
    "assume @xmath69 and @xmath22 is even with @xmath66 .",
    "then we have the bound @xmath70    the expectations on the right of the inequality are taken in the infinite volume limit and with @xmath71 .",
    "if this lower bound is strictly positive it implies the existence of a phase transition at low temperatures , note that the lower bound is valid in any dimension @xmath66 , but as can be seen from equation not in @xmath72 , hence no phase transition .",
    "this is consistent with the well known mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . using the loop model introduced in @xcite and extended in @xcite",
    "we can relate the expectations in the lower bound to the probability of the event @xmath73 , that two nearest neighbours are in the same loop as @xmath74,\\qquad \\left\\langle s_0 ^ 1s_0 ^ 3s_{e_1}^1s_{e_1}^3\\right\\rangle^u_{\\lambda,\\beta,\\mathbf{h}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\mathbb{p}\\left[e_{0,e_1}\\right].\\ ] ] so we can write the lower bound as @xmath75}\\left(\\frac{2}{9}\\sqrt{\\mathbb{p}\\left[e_{0,e_1}\\right]}-\\frac{i_d}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$ ] .",
    "this means a sufficiently large lower bound on @xmath76 $ ] will allow to show the lower bound is positive in high enough dimension . +    for @xmath77 , @xmath16 and @xmath78 even .",

    "hence @xmath99 from this we see that the right side of is @xmath100 . inserting each of these values into and rearranging gives the claim of the proposition .",
    "note that if one could find a state with lower energy than the nel state this lower bound could be improved and hence potentially the theorem strengthened to show phase transitions in lower dimensions .",
    "however the problem of finding lower energy states does not appear an easy one .",
    "the rest of the section will be dedicated to the proof of theorem 3.1 .",
    "we will proceed with calculations for general spin until it becomes necessary to restrict to the case @xmath16 .",
    "fortunately for this hamiltonian we can find a matrix representation .",

    "@xmath106    we must be careful here , as we are working with a matrix of matrices , as to what we mean by multiplication .",
    "the representation is not at all essential to the proof , the advantage of using it is that once has been verified other relations can be stated much more concisely and clearly and easily checked , these relations are not at all obvious or easy to come up with without using .    by the product @xmath105 we follow the ` normal ' matrix multiplication with the added stipulation that for the @xmath91^th^ diagonal entry of @xmath105 the operator @xmath107 will appear first .",
