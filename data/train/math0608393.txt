    "this paper presents an adaptive control methodology for controlling systems with unknown time - varying parameters , which are not required to have slow variation .",
    "the methodology ensures uniformly bounded transient response for system s both signals , input and output , simultaneously , in addition to asymptotic tracking .",
    "the main advantage of this new architecture , as compared to the existing results in the literature , is that it ensures uniform transient tracking for system s input signal in addition to its output .",
    "the @xmath0 norm bounds for the error signals between the closed - loop adaptive system and the closed - loop reference lti system can be systematically reduced by increasing the adaptation gain .",
    "adaptive algorithms achieving arbitrarily improved transient performance in case of constant unknown parameters are given in @xcite , and for unknown time - varying parameters have been given in @xcite . while the results in @xcite improved upon @xcite , by extending the class of systems beyond the slow time - variation of the unknown parameters and guaranteeing performance improvement to arbitrary degree , they still did not provide means for regulating the performance of the control signal during the transient .",
    "a common tendency observed in a variety of applications using adaptive control is that increasing the adaptation gain leads to improved transient tracking of the system output , but the control signal experiences high - frequency oscillations . in @xcite ,",
    "a bound is derived to confirm the first part of this statement assuming appropriate trajectory initialization .",
    "the high - frequency oscillations in the control signal consequently limit the rate of adaptation .",
    "if one considers the simplest adaptive scheme for a scalar linear system with constant disturbance , which can be solved by a pi controller , then it is straightforward to verify that increasing the adaptation gain leads to reduced phase margin for the resulting closed - loop linear system , @xcite .",
    "this observation explains to some extent the oscillations inherent to the control signal in the presence of high adaptation gain .    in recent papers @xcite ,",
    "we have developed a novel @xmath1 adaptive control architecture that permits fast adaptation and yields guaranteed transient response for system s both signals , input and output , simultaneously , in addition to asymptotic tracking .",
    "the main feature of it is the ability of fast adaptation with guaranteed low - frequency control signal .",
    "the ability of fast adaptation ensures the desired transient performance for system s both signals , input and output , simultaneously , while the low - pass filter in the feedback loop attenuates the high - frequency components in the control signal . in this paper",
    "we expand the class of systems to have time - varying unknown parameters of arbitrary rate of variation , and we correspondingly modify the architecture from @xcite to ensure the desired transient performance for system s both signals .",
    "we prove that by increasing the adaptation gain one can achieve arbitrary close transient and asymptotic tracking for system s both signals , input and output , simultaneously . in part",
