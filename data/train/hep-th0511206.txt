    "interest from the particle physics side stems from the fact that the simple lagrangian ( [ eq:1 ] ) shares non - trivial properties with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , notably asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation , meson and baryon bound states , chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum as well as its restoration at high temperature and density ( for a pedagogical review , see @xcite ) .",

    "the fermi velocity plays the role of the velocity of light and the band width the role of the ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff . in some cases",

    "this was illustrated in @xcite where we borrowed results from the theory of non - degenerate conducting polymers , in particular the bipolaron lattice , for solving the zero temperature limit of the massive gn model .    in the process of renormalization the bare mass @xmath8 of the gn model",
    "is replaced by a physical constant @xmath9 , whereas the relation between the coupling constant and the cutoff merely sets the scale of the theory . as a result",
