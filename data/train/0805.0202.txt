    "the amount of existing biological data ( dna and protein sequences ) has increased the need for larger and faster determination of evolutionary history ( or _ phylogeny _ ) given a set of taxa ( i.e.  a set of related biological species  @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the availability of data is not always the same for different taxa .",
    "this is known as the data disparity problem  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", quartet based methods have received greater attention from the computational biology community as a way to overcome the data disparity problem .",
    "quartet - based methods are characterized by first inferring a set of evolutionary relationships between four taxa , and then from these relationships assemble a global evolutionary tree .",
    "considering only four taxa in the first step to build the evolutionary relationships , leads to a greater confidence on the relationships produced .",
    "nevertheless , the relationships obtained may be conflicting or even missing .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain the evolutionary tree , under the parsimony assumption , that respects the maximum number of these relationships on four taxa .    given a set of quartet topologies over a set of taxa , the _ maximum quartet consistency _  ( mqc ) problem consists of computing a global phylogeny that satisfies the maximum number of quartets .",
    "a number of solutions have been proposed for the mqc problem , including dynamic programming , constraint programming , and more recently answer set programming ( asp )  @xcite .",
    "asp is currently the most efficient approach for optimally solving the mqc problem .",
    "this paper develops an encoding for the mqc problem with pseudo - boolean ( pb ) constraints .",
    "initial results are promising , and suggest that pb can be an effective alternative for solving the mqc problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section introduces both the mqc problem and the mqi problem .",
    "the following section develops a pseudo boolean optimization  ( pbo ) model for the mqc problem and section  [ sec : optimizations ] proposes three optimizations to the pbo model .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] shows the experimental results obtained and section  [ sec : conclusions ] presents some conclusions and points some directions for future research .",
    "a _ phylogeny _ is an unrooted tree whose leaves are bijectively mapped to a given set of taxa @xmath0 , where each internal node has degree three .",
    "a _ quartet _ is a size four subset of @xmath0 . for each quartet there",
    "exist three different possible phylogenies , called _ quartet topologies_. consider the quartet @xmath1 , the three possible quartet topologies will be denoted by @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : topologies ] gives a graphical representation of the three possible quartet topologies for the quartet @xmath1 .",
    "for example , quartet topology @xmath2 $ ] means that the path that connects @xmath5 and @xmath6 does not intersect the path connecting @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^ \" , ]     the results were obtained on an intel xeon 5160 , 3ghz server , with 4  gb of ram .",
    "the results comparing the average number of variables and number of constraints between the three pbo models is shown in table  [ tab : res_nvar_nconst_10tx ] . as can be seen from the table",
    "the model that requires more variables and more constraints is the pbo+trd model , whereas , the model that requires less variables and less constraints is the pbo+(scd+trd ) .",
    "table  [ tab : res_10tx ] compares the average cpu times on the instances considered for all the pbo models and the phy+smodes model .",
    "a few conclusions can be drawn from the results . first comparing the _ pbo+fst _ and the basic _ pbo+trd _ model .",
    "the sharing of auxiliary variables introduced by the first optimization is an important aspect in this problem .",
    "this optimization reduces the number of variables used by the encoding as well as the number of constraints .",
    "this reduction leads to lower cpu time spent by the pbo - solver .",
    "nevertheless , model _",
    "pbo+(scd+trd ) _ reduces even further the model by considering the selection variables as bits of the binary representation of values in @xmath9 .",
    "again , it can be seen from table  [ tab : res_10tx ] , that the reduction on the number of variables and constraints used by the encoding resulted in lower cpu times spent by the pbo - solver , where the model _",
    "pbo+(scd+trd ) _ is on average approximately 4 times faster than the _",
    "pbo+trd _ and 1.6 times faster than _",
    "pbo+fst_.    comparing the best of our pbo models ( _ pbo+(scd+trd ) _ ) with the asp model , the asp model is more effective when the percentage of modified quartets is small , but the _",
    "pbo+(scd+trd ) _ model becomes more when the percentage of modified quartets increases .",
    "this paper proposes a first attempt at solving the mqc problem with pbo .",
    "the new pbo model is compared with a recent solution based on asp  @xcite , which is currently the most efficient for the mqc problem . despite the number of the taxa considered being modest ,",
    "the results show that the pbo model can be beneficial when the number of expected quartet errors is high .",
    "the pbo model is still recent , and additional modeling insights and corresponding performance improvements are to be expected in the near future .",
    "future research will involve developing optimizations to the pbo model .",
    "for example , by encoding with pb constraints some of the optimizations proposed in the literature for the mqc problem .",
    "furthermore , experiments will consider larger sets of taxa as well as real world data .                    c.  sinz . towards an optimal cnf encoding of boolean cardinality constraints . in _ principles and practice of constraint programming - cp 2005 , 11th international conference _",
