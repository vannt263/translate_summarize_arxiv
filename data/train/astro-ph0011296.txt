    "sw sex systems are a sub - class of nova - like cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) with peculiar spectroscopic behavior @xcite .",
    "they exhibit strong single - peaked balmer , and emission lines which , with the exception of , remain largely unobscured during primary eclipse ( suggesting emission in vertical structures ) .",
    "the radial velocity curves of balmer and lines show significant phase lags relative to photometric minimum , and display absorption components which show maximum depth at phase opposite primary eclipse ( @xcite ) .",
    "currently , none of the proposed models have succesfully explained all the sw sex peculiarities .",
    "the first model was proposed by @xcite , who suggested the presence of an accretion disk wind .",
    "@xcite invoked magnetic accretion , with single - peaked lines arising in accretion columns above the orbital plane , while @xcite introduced a gas stream which overflows the disk .",
    "@xcite proposed an scenario in which matter is accreted on to the magnetic poles of a synchronously rotating white dwarf .",
    "more recently , @xcite introduced the idea of a disk - anchored magnetic propeller .",
    "the latest model was proposed by @xcite , who invoked the presence of a strong shock that occurs along the accretion stream trajectory , but inside the disk .",
    "ls peg ( s193 ) is a non - eclipsing sw sex system with an orbital period of @xmath3 4.19 h ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite did not detect a significant level of circular polarization in the 50006000   band after averaging only two 8 minute exposures .",
    "the reported polarization level was @xmath4 % .",
    "the spectropolarimetric observations of ls peg were performed on the night of 1998 august 7 with the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma and the isis triple spectrograph , using the r600b grating and the @xmath5 pixel@xmath6 eev10 ccd chip .",
    "a 1  slit gave a spectral resolution of 1.44    and the wavelength coverage was @xmath737205070 .",
    "a quarterwave plate and a savart calcite plate were placed in the optical path , above and below the slit , respectively .",
    "the circular polarization spectra were obtained as described by @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameter @xmath8 is contained in the intensity ratio of both spectra ( ordinary and extraordinary ) , but it contains the response of the spectrograph . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio between the o- and e - spectrum in a given exposure is independent of the sky transparency . in order to eliminate any instrumental effects",
    ", we took a second exposure with the quarterwave plate rotated by 90 degrees .",
    "the spectrograph response remains unchanged whilst the contrast between the o- and e - ray is inverted relative to the first exposure . by comparing both exposures ,",
    "the instrumental response is taken out .",
    "each pair of exposures contains the level of polarization , @xmath9 , where the stokes parameter @xmath10 represents the total intensity .",
    "a total of 38 spectra were obtained , covering approximately one orbital period of the system .",
    "we used an exposure time of 250 seconds and spectra of a cu - ar comparison arc lamp were taken regularly throughout the night in order to achieve an optimal wavelength calibration .",
    "all the frames were de - biased , flat - fielded and sky - subtracted in the standard way . finally , the spectra were optimally extracted @xcite .",
    "these reduction processes were performed using iraf routines .",
    "for wavelength calibration and most of subsequent analyses we used the molly package .",
    "a third - order polynomial was fitted to the arc data , the @xmath11 being always less than 0.1  .",
    "the spectra were then re - binned into an uniform velocity scale .",
    "we also observed a zero polarization standard star to calibrate the results .",
    "balmer lines in ls peg show broad , asymmetric wings ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) , caused by a high - velocity emission component ( an s - wave ) that crosses the line core from red to blue at @xmath12 . at this point",
    "we have to note that we considered the red - to - blue crossing of the radial velocity curve to be the instant of zero phase .",
    "this has been proved in eclipsing sw sex stars ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we present the trailed spectra of h@xmath1 , constructed from the normalized spectra .",
    "if we closely inspect the wings of h@xmath1 , especially in the blue , we can easily detect the presence of flares .",
    "this seems to indicate that the high - velocity components can be modulated with a short period .",
    "we measured the equivalent width ( ew ) of the blue wing of h@xmath1 in all the _ normalized _ individual spectra , considering that the wing extends from 4000 km s@xmath13 to 800 km s@xmath13 with respect to the line rest wavelength . with the aim of finding periodicities , we computed a periodogram of the resulting ew curve , which we show in the upper panel of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "two main peaks are clearly seen : one centred at the orbital frequency ( @xmath14 d@xmath13 ) and another one at @xmath15 d@xmath13 , which corresponds to a period of @xmath16 minutes .",
    "we must note that the error in @xmath17 is half the fwhm of the corresponding peak , as derived from a gaussian fit , so it is overestimated . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the ew data in phase with @xmath18 after phase folding the data into 20 phase bins .",
    "the modulation with this period is evident .",
    "we obtained the polarization spectra from the non - normalized spectra , as described in   1 .",
    "as the total database comprises 38 individual spectra , we have 19 spectra of circular polarization with a time resolution of about 10 minutes .",
    "first , we derived the average circular polarization level in the range @xmath739005070 ( approximately the johnson @xmath19-band ) for each of the 19 polarization spectra , including both the continuum and the lines . to find periodicities we constructed the power spectrum of these data , which we present in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "there is a prominent peak centred at @xmath20 d@xmath13 , which corresponds to a period of @xmath21 minutes . after folding the polarization data on this period",
    ", we find a clear modulation of amplitude ( peak - to - peak ) @xmath22 ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) . to find whether the observed",
    "polarization comes from the lines or from the continuum , we repeated this analysis in selected regions of the continuum , finding exactly the same periodicity and amplitude .",
    "these results indicate that the observed circular polarization comes from the continuum .",
    "the folded curve in figure  [ fig3 ] exhibits significant dispersion , that can be a consequence of short - scale source variability , so one can question the statistical significance of the result .",
    "we performed a sinusoidal fit to the folded curve , obtaining a reduced @xmath23 of 0.05  % .",
    "the amplitude is 0.15  % , that is , 3@xmath24 , so we can say that the result is statistically significant .",
    "furthermore , achieving a polarization accuracy below 0.1  % with the isis spectrograph is possible .",
    "for instance , dhillon & rutten ( 1995 ) measured a @xmath25 linear polarization level in the sw sex star v1315 aql .",
    "they calibrated the results observing a zero - polarization star , finding no evidence for instrumental polarization at a level greater than 0.01  % .",
    "we have detected a clear ew modulation in the blue wing of h@xmath1 , with a frequency of @xmath15 d@xmath13 .",
    "similar flaring behavior has been observed in h@xmath26 , h@xmath1 , and @xmath274686 in the spectra of the sw sex - type old nova bt mon @xcite , with a period of @xmath28  32 minutes , and more recently in the sw sex star dw uma @xcite , where a 30-minute period is found .",
    "this flaring is typical of intermediate polar cvs ( ips , e.g. fo aqr , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we have also discovered variable circular polarization in ls pegasi .",
    "it is the first time that circular polarization is detected in an sw sex system . since the measured polarization comes from the continuum , we tentatively attribute its origin to cyclotron emission ( see   4.2 for discussion ) .",
    "we associate the period @xmath29 to the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "this result seems to suggest an `` ip - like '' structure in ls peg . of the known ips ,",
    "only three show circular polarization : bg cmi @xcite , pq gem ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and rx j1712.6 - 2414 @xcite .",
    "the reason why we only observe circular polarization in these ips is that they harbor the most magnetic white dwarves ( @xmath30 28 mg , @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency of the ew modulation ( @xmath17 ) is slightly smaller than the assumed spin frequency ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the difference between them is @xmath32 d@xmath13 which coincides with the orbital frequency .",
    "hence , we identify @xmath18 with the beat period ( i.e. synodic ) between the white dwarf spin period and the orbital period .",
    "@xcite reports the observation of a bright spot in sw sex itself ( when the system was in low state ) located well inside the outer disk radius , between 0.40.6 @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is the distance from the inner lagrangian point ( @xmath34 ) to the white dwarf .",
    "he suggested that this hot region is the consequence of a strong shock between the gas stream and the disk , but he also pointed out that the mechanism producing the shock is not clear . from the results we present for ls peg , we propose that this inner bright spot could be produced by the shock of the disk - overflown gas stream against the white dwarf s magnetosphere",
    ". the shock should occur close to the corotation radius ( i.e. the distance from the primary at which the keplerian and white dwarf angular velocities match , @xmath35 ) and above the disk plane .",
    "current theories of accretion disk - magnetic field interaction require the magnetospheric radius to be nearly equal to the corotation radius ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let s assume that the shock takes place close to @xmath35 .",
    "then , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . the distance ( expressed in units of the orbital separation , @xmath38 ) between the white dwarf and the @xmath34 point is given by @xmath39 @xcite , while the corotation radius is : @xmath40^{\\frac{1}{3 } } ,     \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the mass of the primary and @xmath42 its spin period . from kepler s third law and assuming @xmath43",
    ", we obtain : @xmath44 for ls peg , @xmath45 d and @xmath46 min ( from the circular polarization modulation ) , so @xmath47 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the derived bright spot location in sw sex , suggesting that the magnetic shock mechanism could be also present in this system .",
    "furthermore , we have detected variable @xmath19-band circular polarization in sw sex itself ( p. rodrguez - gil et al . , in preparation ) with a period of about 28 minutes . entering this value together with the orbital period in ( [ eq2 ] ) , we get @xmath48 , which is consistent with groot s results .      the magnetospheric radius in ips , @xmath49 , is usually given by @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the alfvn radius . then , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the magnetic moment of the primary , @xmath41 its mass , and @xmath54 the mass transfer rate . as we mentioned above",
    ", the magnetospheric radius should be comparable to the corotation radius , so let s assume that @xmath55 . from ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath56 entering @xmath57 s , and @xmath58 ( a plausible mass value for sw sex systems ) , we finally get : @xmath59 to derive the magnetic field of the white dwarf in ls peg , we must know its radius ( @xmath60 ) , since @xmath61",
    ". we can give an estimate of @xmath60 using the mass - radius relation for white dwarfs with carbon cores of @xcite , obtaining @xmath62 cm for a @xmath58 white dwarf .",
    "on the other hand , we must enter a value for the mass accretion rate , @xmath54 . from the results of @xcite",
    ", we can consider that @xmath63 g s@xmath13 in sw sex systems .",
    "hence , the magnetic field intensity of the white dwarf in ls peg should be @xmath64 this range of values is consistent with what is found in the ips which show circular polarization . nevertheless , we have to stress the fact that we see modulated circular polarization in the @xmath19-band . in pq gem ( @xmath6521 mg , @xcite )",
    ", little circular polarization is detected in that band .",
    "as cyclotron models predict , pq gem shows a level of circular polarization increasing redwards from the @xmath8-band , so it is not completely clear that the circular polarization we observe in ls peg is related to continuum cyclotron emission . on the other hand",
    ", we can not completely rule out this possibility due to the fact that the polarization level in ls peg is very low",
    ". it would be crucial to perform longer wavelength circular polarimetry to determine whether the circular polarization we see is of cyclotron emission origin .",
    "we finally propose that magnetic accretion plays a fundamental role in the behavior of sw sex stars , and that they are ip systems with mass accretion rates probably larger than in the rest of ips in quiescence .",
