    "binary ferromagnetic materials with the l1@xmath1 structure are promising candidates for use as magneto - optical recording media thanks to their high magnetic anisotropy . the l1@xmath0 structure ( also called the cuau structure )",
    "is based on the face centered lattice of tetragonal symmetry .",
    "it is build by alternating @xmath2 pure planes of each type of atoms .",
    "three variants are present in the l1@xmath1 structure : x- , y- and z - variants .",
    "the z - variant is build when the ( 001 ) pure atomic planes are stacked along the [ 001 ] direction , whereas the x- and y- variant are obtained when the pure atomic planes are stacked along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions respectively . among the most investigated systems are co - pt , fe - pt , and fe - pd .",
    "they present a tetragonal distortion of the lattice ( @xmath3 1 ) @xcite and exhibits a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the range @xmath4  mj.m@xmath5 with the @xmath6-axis as the easy magnetisation axis .",
    "the discovery of the interesting properties of these materials dates back to the 1930 s .",
    "they have been , however , the topic of many intensive experimental and theoretical works in the last decades ( see @xcite and references therein ) . a good knowledge of the ordering processes and of its dynamics is a necessary step in any extensive research on those systems . +   + a systematic study of the physical , thermodynamic and kinetic properties in the fe  pd , fe  pt and co  pt ordered alloys is now in progress .",
    "atomic migration has been investigated using experimental resistivity measurements and lattice dynamics to deduce the atomic migration energies at different temperatures and states of atomic order .",
    "the study is almost completed in fepd @xcite whereas , the other two systems are still under investigation . in parallel to these experimental investigations , numerical simulations of the thermodynamical properties and structural kinetics have been performed using monte carlo methods and molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "l1@xmath0-ordering kinetics in fept nano - layers have been recently simulated using a monte carlo method based on pair interaction energies deduced from the cluster expansion method @xcite .",
    "the results indicate a clear stabilisation effect of pt - surface on the @xmath7-variant of the l1@xmath0 structure .",
    "+   + in this paper , we present systematic monte carlo simulations of the l1@xmath0 long - range order relaxation in dimensionally reduced systems . for this purpose the isothermal relaxation of the long - range order ( lro ) parameter is investigated in the @xmath7-variant of the l1@xmath0 structure , with different numbers of ( 001)-type monatomic layers .",
    "we first present the effect of the film thickness on the order - disorder transition for different ordering energies . to get more insight into the order - order kinetics , the isothermal relaxation of a short - range order parameter , namely the anti - site pair correlation ( apc ) parameter is simulated along with the lro parameter .",
    "finally , the arrhenius plots of the relaxation times are used to deduce the vacancy migration energy for different film thicknesses .",
    "the present work attempts to know to which extent are influenced the kinetics in dimensionally reduced l1@xmath0 compounds in comparison to processes taking place in bulk systems .",
    "stochastic techniques , based on random processes , such as monte carlo methods have been used to solve a wide variety of problems @xcite .",
    "they have been established as a powerful technique to investigate the kinetics relaxation of the long - range order in intermetallic @xcite .",
    "+   + dimensionally reduced l1@xmath1 systems have been modeled by a set of @xmath8 atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 atoms @xmath11 distributed on a perfect face - centered - cubic rigid lattice with a linear size @xmath12 along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions and variable thickness @xmath13 along the [ 001 ] direction . to conform to the stoichiometry of the l1@xmath1 structure , there are as many @xmath9 as @xmath11 atoms .",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used along @xmath14 and @xmath15-axis whereas these have been removed along the @xmath7-axis . as a result of symmetry breaking , relaxation and reconstruction processes often take place at the free surfaces of real thin - films inducing local defects and building extra units or clusters .",
    "surface - induced defects being beyond the scope of the present study , we restrict ourself to flat and ideal surfaces . assuming interactions up to next nearest - neighbours",
    "only , the total energy of the system can be expressed in a general @xmath16 model by an ising hamiltonian @xcite @xmath17 where the sum extends over all the nearest and the next nearest - neighbour pairs and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are generic indexes sweeping all the lattice .",
    "the occupation operator on site @xmath18 , @xmath20 can take the values : + 1 , -1 , and 0 if site @xmath18 is occupied by an @xmath9 atom , a @xmath11 atom , or a vacancy @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 are the pair interaction energies between atoms at sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for convenience",
    "the pair interactions can be labeled by the shell index @xmath23 , which in the present work can take the value 1 and 2 for the nearest - neighbours and the next nearest - neighbours , respectively .",
    "following earlier works in bulk l1@xmath0 compounds @xcite , phenomenological pair interaction energies are used with a constant value of the first pair interaction @xmath24 and different values of the second pair interaction v@xmath25 .",
    "we have chosen to restrict our study to symmetric interaction energies and neglect the vacancy - atom interactions : @xmath26 vacancy - atom interactions are usually considered to take into account local distortions and relaxation around vacancies .",
    "however , the static lattice displacement has been measured by neutron diffuse scattering in an l1@xmath1-fepd by one of the present authors and has been found to be weak @xcite .",
    "the use of symmetric interactions greatly reduces the number of simulation parameters without changing the order - disorder transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the use of such `` toy model '' has been widely and successfully used to investigate the kinetics relaxation in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the atomic mechanism of order relaxation in dense phases @xcite : vacancy - atom exchange between nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "the simulation starts with a perfect l1@xmath0 ordered crystal in which one of the two sub - lattices ( sub - lattice @xmath27 ) is occupied by a atoms and the other ( sub - lattice @xmath28 ) by b atoms . to keep close to real systems and avoid any interaction effect between vacancies , only a single vacancy is introduced at random in the simulation box .",
    "the elementary monte carlo step is the following : one of the vacancy neighbours ( a or b atom ) is randomly chosen , the energy balance @xmath29 of the atom - vacancy exchange before and after the jump is evaluated with the ising hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "1 ) , considering the two nearest - neighbour shells of the initial and final atomic positions .",
    "the jump is performed if the glauber probability @xcite @xmath30}\\ ] ] is larger than a random number between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this corresponds to averaging the result over a large number of reversal jump attempts , the sum of the probabilities of the jump and its reversal being equal to @xmath32 .",
    "+   + the configuration of the system was analysed , at regular time intervals , by calculating two parameters : ( i ) an effective lro parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of a atoms on the @xmath27 sub - lattice and @xmath35 the total number of a atoms .",
    "( ii ) @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of nearest - neighbour pairs of antisites and @xmath38 i d the number of @xmath27-antisite .",
    "the time scale being the number of jump attempts .",
    "one should keep in mind that the monte carlo time we refer to here is a `` raw '' time .",
    "its mapping to physical time scale in seconds , in a system - specific study , requires the knowledge of the physical properties e.g. the vacancy concentration at different temperatures , diffusion coefficient etc .",
    "the relaxation of the lro and the apc parameters towards their equilibrium values has been simulated in the @xmath7-variant , with ( 001)-type monoatomic layers of the l1@xmath1 structure for different film thicknesses and different values of @xmath39 . for each temperature",
    ", the evolution of @xmath40 is followed until the system reaches equilibrium .",
    "we have chosen to stop when the simulation time was at least 5 times greater than the longer relaxation time of the system .",
    "the number of ( 001 ) layers has been varied from 8 up to 190 leading to more than 2000 simulations . due to size effects , simulations of small film thicknesses suffered from poor statistics and very long relaxation times .",
    "all calculations have been performed on pentium 4 processors using a fortran 77 program .",
    "the equilibrium value of the lro parameter @xmath41 _ versus _ temperature is plotted in figure 1 for different film thicknesses in the case @xmath42 . as expected , the order - disorder transition temperature , t@xmath43 , decreases with decreasing film - thicknesses as a result of the decrease in the relative number of atomic bounds caused by the symmetry breaking at the free surfaces .",
    "this behaviour is well seen in figure 2 in which the reduced critical temperature @xmath44 is reported against the film - thickness @xmath13 for different values of @xmath45 . @xmath46",
    "being defined as the transition temperature for film - thicknesses greater than 128 .",
    "the reduced transition temperature falls on a unique curve for all the pair interaction values , showing a plateau for @xmath47 , reflecting the bulk behaviour of the system .",
    "the extrapolation of the curve towards very thin films gives , in the limit @xmath48 , zero .",
    "indeed , in this limit , the system reduces to one monoatomic plane containing only one kind of atoms .",
    "the system becomes then unstable regardless of the sign of first and second nearest - neighbours pair interactions .",
    "+   + for small film - thicknesses the order - disorder , transition is found to be of first order type and the transition is clearly discontinuous .",
    "the calculated transition temperatures for @xmath47 for different values of @xmath45 agree quite well with previous monte carlo simulation of the lro relaxation in l1@xmath1 bulk compounds @xcite . for low and high film thicknesses",
    "as well , the transition temperature has been found , as expected , correlated to the ratio @xmath39 .",
    "+   + figure 3 shows a typical snapshot of two neighbouring ( 010 ) atomic planes obtained in the equilibrium state of a film with 32 atomic layers at @xmath49 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the disordering takes place first at the free surfaces and then grows into the film .",
    "nucleation of the @xmath14 and the @xmath15-variants of the l1@xmath1 structure are also seen .",
    "in good agreement with the predictions of the path probability method @xcite and with many experimental and computational results in intermetallics @xcite , the relaxations of the lro have been found to be well fitted with the sum of two exponentials yielding a long @xmath50 and short @xmath51 relaxation time : @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of the lro relaxation towards the equilibrium value @xmath54 obtained for @xmath55 with @xmath42 and its fit using two exponentials .",
    "the coefficient values @xmath56 of the fast relaxation process deduced from fits using eq .",
    "4 for different film thicknesses and different values of @xmath45 are depicted in fig .",
    "note that presenting the results as a function of the lro is equivalent to presenting them as a function of temperature . in good agreement with previous monte carlo simulation of the kinetics relaxation in bulk l1@xmath1-fepd @xcite ,",
    "the fast process is dominant for @xmath57 .",
    "its contribution to the overall relaxation however decreases from @xmath58 down to @xmath59 for @xmath55 ( @xmath42 , @xmath60 ) . for low enough thicknesses and high ordering states , the fast process smears out and",
    "the slow one becomes dominant ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "a detailed study in the l1@xmath25 phase has shown that the short relaxation time is related to the formation of the nearest - neighbour antisite pairs , whereas the longer one is related to the uncoupling of these antisite pairs @xcite .",
    "the l1@xmath25 phase of ab@xmath62 compounds is also an fcc - based structure with however a stoichiometry proportion @xmath63 .",
    "the a atoms occupy the cubic cell corners and the b atoms occupy the center of faces . the striking feature of fig .",
    "5 is that for low film thicknesses ( @xmath64 ) the same final degree of order ( @xmath60 ) is reached through different processes , depending on the pair interaction energies . for @xmath42 the fast process contributes with a fraction of @xmath65 to the overall relaxation whereas when @xmath66 the fast process contributes more than @xmath67 stressing definitely both geometrical and energetic effects on the feature of `` order - order '' relaxations . to further investigate this point ,",
    "we have calculated the relaxation of the apc parameter towards its equilibrium value for different film thicknesses with nearly the same final state of order ( @xmath60 for @xmath42 and @xmath68 for @xmath66 ) .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "6 . for low film thicknesses , namely @xmath64 , where the contribution of the fast process is less than @xmath69 ,",
    "the early disordering stages are accompanied by a very fast increase of apc which reaches a maximum value before starting to decrease , while the effective lro parameter decreases further .",
    "this behaviour is not seen in cases where the fast process is dominant , that is for film thicknesses @xmath70 .",
    "the fast decrease of the lro in the early stage of relaxation is due to the formation of nearest - neighbour pair of antisites ( increase of apc in fig .",
    "this process is very efficient in quickly decreasing the lro .",
    "it saturates however after a while , and further decrease in the lro ( slow process ) is due to the uncoupling of these nearest - neighbour antisite pairs which give rise to single antisite diffusion jumps ( decrease of apc in fig .",
    "6 ) . both in l1@xmath25 and l1@xmath1 structures",
    "antisite atoms may easily migrate within one sublattice without inducing any disorder .",
    "this process was shown to be responsible of the slow relaxation process in l1@xmath25-ordered compounds due to the uncoupling of the nearest - neighbour antisite pairs .",
    "such events occur in the l1@xmath1 structure within the basal planes and only four jump possibilities are offered , in comparison to eight in the l1@xmath25 structure . as a result , such antisite diffusion jumps are definitely rare in l1@xmath1 compounds in comparison to l1@xmath25 compounds .",
    "this explains the very low contribution of the slow process in bulk - l1@xmath1 compounds .",
    "however , by reducing the @xmath7-axis dimension , the fraction of such jumps become equal or even higher than that all possible jumps giving rise to a dominant slow relaxation process , obtained in the case of @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "the longer relaxation time , @xmath50 was found to follow an arrhenius law yielding a vacancy migration energy , @xmath71 , which has been deduced from the linear regression of the arrhenius plots for different film thicknesses @xmath13 in the case @xmath42 ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the increase in @xmath71 for low film thicknesses can be explained by the fact that the thinner the film the smaller are the degrees of freedom of the atomic motion .",
    "the film thickness effect is strong not only on the migration energy but also on the diffusion process itself . depending on the film thickness",
    ", the final equilibrium state is reached by different routes ( see fig .",
    "6 ) along which the vacancy encounters different atomic surroundings , leading to different migration energies .",
    "if one extrapolates @xmath71 towards very low film thicknesses , namely @xmath48 , we get a migration energy of @xmath72 .",
    "et al _ @xcite have obtained a linear variation of @xmath71 with @xmath45 for binary two - dimensional lattice .",
    "the linear extrapolation of their data to @xmath42 leads to @xmath73 , in good agreement with the present deduction .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that , @xmath74 is the extrapolation from @xmath64 towards very small thicknesses , thus the comparison is rather qualitative . smaller film thicknesses are necessary for any further discussion , they were , however , extremely difficult to simulate within reasonable cpu time .",
    "+   + different experimental methods have been used to determine activation energies in l1@xmath1 fept and copt thin films and multilayers .",
    "grazing incidence synchrotron reflection ( girns ) @xcite has been used to measure diffusion coefficient at different temperatures in fept multilayers . due to the geometry of the set - up used , only the activation energy along the c - axis could be measured .",
    "it has been found to be equal to @xmath75 , which differs from extrapolation of high temperature tracer data @xcite .",
    "resistivity measurement showed that the activation energy drops from @xmath76 for @xmath77 to @xmath78 for @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the latter value agrees quite well with those deduced from the shift with temperature of the differential scanning calorimetry peak of the order - disorder transition with heating rate in fept thin films ( @xmath80 ) @xcite . the same analysis in copt thin films yields an activation energy of @xmath81 .",
    "it is believed that the diversity of activation energies in fept multilayers results from the variety of processes involved in the relaxations .",
    "assuming that the activation energy , @xmath82 , is the sum of @xmath71 and the vacancy formation energy @xmath83 , the simulated values of @xmath84 agree qualitatively well with the experimental data . in our study , we keep a constant number of vacancies , therefore we do not have access to @xmath83 .",
    "the vacancy formation energy @xmath83 has been measured in pure co , pt @xcite and fe @xcite , it has been found equal to @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 for co , pt and fe respectively .",
    "considering the simulated @xmath88 obtained for the lowest film thickness @xmath64 for @xmath42 in figure 7 , added to an average value of e@xmath89 in the pure co and pt component , we get an activation energy in copt of @xmath90 , which has to be compared to @xmath81 , measured in equiatomic copt thin films .",
    "a better agreement is obtained in the case of fept . with the same approach",
    ", we get e@xmath91 which agrees well with the measured activation energy in fept thin films given above .",
    "the better agreement observed for fept in comparison to copt is not fortuitous .",
    "_ have calculated the pair interaction energies in l1@xmath1-copt and fept using first - principle calculations @xcite .",
    "they give , @xmath92 , @xmath93 for fept and @xmath94 , @xmath95 for copt .",
    "the value of the first pair interaction of fept used in our calculations is very close the calculated value .",
    "a monte carlo method was applied to investigate the relaxation of the lro in dimensionally reduced l1@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the order - disorder transition has been found to be first - order for low film thicknesses and , as expected , its temperature strongly dependent on the pair interaction energies .",
    "a substantial increase in the migration energy has been obtained for low film thicknesses . by analysing the relaxation of the lro and the antisite pair correlation parameters",
    ", we could stress that both geometrical and energetic effects play an important role in the interplay between the fast and the slow relaxation processes during `` order - order '' relaxations .",
    "despite of the simplicity of our model , which does not take into account substrate effect and assumes temperature independent interaction energies , we could reproduce qualitatively migration energies measured in l1@xmath1 thin film and multilayers .",
