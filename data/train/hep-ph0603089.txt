    "it has a pole at @xmath66 mev , but the observed @xmath11 elastic phase shift goes through @xmath67 at @xmath68 gev .",
    "how are these two facts reconciled ?",
    "the clue is that the width is strongly @xmath32-dependent , with a zero at the adler point @xmath69 , just below threshold .",
    "experiments on @xmath11 elastic scattering are done at real values of @xmath32 . in finding the pole ,",
    "it is necessary to extrapolate the measured amplitude off the real @xmath32-axis .",

    "oller drew attention to this earlier [ 20 ] .",
    "the result is that the pole is approximately @xmath77 ahead of the phase of the amplitude along the real axis ; there is a further small phase variation arising from the slowly varying function @xmath72 , but it is only a few degrees in practice .",
    "qualitatively , the broad @xmath11 amplitude measured on the real @xmath32-axis may be viewed as a long tail of the pole buried deep in the complex @xmath32-plane .",

    "the broad component of the @xmath11 s - wave continues through the mass range 1 to 2 gev .",
    "it stretches the imagination to interpret it as the tail of the @xmath7 pole .",
    "it may therefore have a further origin in that mass range .",
    "for example , anisovich et al . [ 22 ] argue that is should be interpreted there as a broad glueball .    for the @xmath8 ,",
    "the situation is even more extreme .",
    "the phase rotation between the pole and the real @xmath32-axis is @xmath80 .",
    "the long tail of this pole is fitted to @xmath13 elastic phase shifts determined in the lass experiment of aston et al . [ 23 ] .",
    "because of the very large phase rotation , these phase shifts do not quite reach @xmath67 over the mass range where they have been measured .",
    "the view being examined here is a narrow one , that the amplitude for the so - called @xmath7 in the vicinity of the @xmath6 and @xmath12 thresholds may be expressed in terms of just two orthogonal states @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "likewise , the amplitude for the @xmath8 may be expressed in terms of just two orthogonal states @xmath8 and @xmath81 .",

    "the @xmath11 s - wave amplitude is known up to 1.9 gev .",
    "one can take the fourier transform of the observed @xmath32-dependence to determine the radius of interaction .",
    "the result is a rather small rms radius of 0.45 fm [ 21 ] .",
    "this is quite enough to produce a large form factor between the mass of the @xmath7 pole and 1 gev , and likewise between the mass of the @xmath8 and the @xmath82 and @xmath15 thresholds .",
    "one should remain alert to the fact that coupling parameters are likely to be @xmath32-dependent .",
    "it is therefore not realistic to use ratios like @xmath83 for quantitative purposes , because the poles are too far apart .",
    "data on @xmath43 radiative decays are analysed in an accompanying paper [ 24 ] and provide a precise measurement of the ratio @xmath84 from interference with @xmath10 .",
    "this will be taken as a reliable number at the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "data on @xmath85 are also analysed in ref .",
    "these data are fitted over a range of masses up to 1.9 gev ; they appear to confirm the result from kloe data within a somewhat larger error .",
    "there is a further caveat which is rarely discussed . for an isolated @xmath7 produced without @xmath10 ,",
    "there is a multiple scattering series for @xmath86 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath87 has its own multiple scattering series . in @xmath11 elastic scattering , both the broad @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath10 appear strongly at 1 gev in cern - munich data [ 25 ] .",
    "the multiple scattering series then contains additional terms of the form @xmath88 and vice versa .",
    "these cross - terms are likely to lead to dynamical mixing of @xmath10 and @xmath7 unless the overlap of their wave function happens to be zero",
    ". however , this mixing can vary from process to process , depending on how much of each is produced in the formation reaction .",
    "for example , in @xmath89 , the @xmath90 is produced strongly , but there is little or no @xmath10 [ 3 ] . in @xmath91 , the @xmath10",
    "is produced strongly with a small @xmath7 amplitude accompanying it [ 16 ] .    in elastic scattering ,",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath10 are produced strongly .",
    "the analysis of data in the accompanying paper [ 24 ] shows that a substantial @xmath47 component is needed near the @xmath6 threshold with @xmath92 .",
    "however , it appears to be somewhat localised near the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "kloe data on @xmath93 will not tolerate a @xmath47 component with the large width of the @xmath7 ; this amplitude must be attenuated strongly below @xmath94 mev .",
    "it may be fitted using a rather strong form factor latexmath:[$\\exp -\\alpha     above the @xmath6 threshold , data on @xmath85 again require a rather strong form factor to fit the observed strong decrease in the cross section from 1 to 1.8 gev .",
    "the result is a broad peak in the coupling to @xmath6 over a mass range roughly 800 to 1300 mev .",
    "a straightforward possibility is that there is mixing between @xmath10 and @xmath7 , peaking there .",
    "for this reason , the analysis in the next section will focus on ratios of @xmath44 only close to @xmath6 and @xmath12 thresholds .",
    "flatt ' e formulae have been used in fitting @xmath31 and @xmath5 , but ignoring coupling of @xmath9 to @xmath96 and @xmath10 to @xmath12 .",
    "tests adding these couplings suggest that effects are small compared with errors assigned by the experimental groups .",
    "the bes data have been refitted allowing the @xmath12 coupling explicitly , but the data suggest no coupling to this channel .",
    "the main source of systematic error for the @xmath5 is the effect of possible mixing with @xmath7 . this mixing depends on unknown wave functions .",
    "the coupling constant for @xmath47 is particularly sensitive to this mixing , but errors assigned in ref .",
    "[ 24 ] are intended to cover the range of possible form factors fitted to both @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath7 pole was determined by the bes collaboration [ 3 ] fitting several different breit - wigner forms .",
    "the quoted systematic errors cover this range of possibilities .",
    "some authors have raised the possibility of unknown ` non - resonant backgrounds ' in the @xmath7 .",
    "however , without educated guesses about such possible backgrounds , there is no limit to the possible range of parameters which can be fitted .",
    "the approach adopted here is to fit a simple empirical @xmath32-dependent width including the adler zero ; errors for the fitted parameters cover the likely range of possibilities .",
    "the same approach is adopted for the @xmath8 . there , the main problem in fitting parameters is unknown mixing with @xmath81 .",
    "however , the latest refit to lass , bes and e791 data [ 5 ] arrives at a consistent picture from the three sets of data ; the range of parameters fitting all three sets of data will be used to cover possible systematic errors .",
    "there is a small systematic discrepancy with lass data around 1.2 gev , and its effect on possible coupling to @xmath14 will be discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "parameters of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are completely insensitive to precise locations of the adler zeros .",
    "it is necessary first to discuss the selection of data used for this comparison .",
    "the @xmath7 pole will be taken from the high statistics data of bes , where there is a clearly visible peak with a well defined mass and width [ 3 ] .",
    "the @xmath8 pole will be taken from the combined analysis of e791 and bes production data and lass phase shifts [ 5 ] .",
    "the @xmath10 appears as a strong peak in bes data for @xmath97 and @xmath98 [ 16 ] .",
    "its width is precisely determined by the @xmath11 peak because of the very good mass resolution .",
    "the signal is clearly visible near threshold in the @xmath6 channel .",
    "the ratio of events in this peak to that in the @xmath11 peak determines the branching ratio @xmath99 accurately .",
    "the @xmath9 is subjected to detailed scrutiny in an accompanying paper [ 24 ] which compares a fit to kloe data on @xmath100 with an earlier determination from crystal barrel data [ 18 ] .",
    "there is agreement within errors , and values of @xmath44 are taken from the combined analysis .",
    "most other experimental determinations quoted by the particle data group are fitted to a breit - wigner resonance of constant width , an assumption far from reality .",
    "the comparison of @xmath44 made here is motivated by a similar comparison for well known @xmath101 states such as @xmath40 and @xmath39 . after allowing for effects due to identical particles ( discussed in detail in the next section ) ,",
    "the prediction for @xmath102 is 3/4 .",
    "this agrees well with experiment if one allows a p - wave blatt - weisskopf centrifugal barrier for both decays with a reasonable radius of 0.5 fm . for @xmath7 and its relatives",
    ", no centrifugal barrier is involved between mesons , so a comparison of @xmath44 should be a meaningful test of the models .",

    "corresponding formulae for @xmath103 are given by jaffe in table 7 of his publication [ 4 ] .",
    "however there is an important subtlety concerned with these formulae for identical particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "consider the breit - wigner amplitude @xmath104 for a process involving non - identical particles : @xmath105 , @xmath106 the integrated cross section involves an integral @xmath107 over the solid angle .",

    ", there are two amplitudes @xmath114 and @xmath115 which add coherently .",
    "the integrated intensity over angles is @xmath116 . for @xmath117 , there are again contributions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , but the angular integration should now be done over only one hemisphere , to avoid counting both @xmath120 from a single event .",
    "the result is @xmath121 .",
    "the total @xmath11 integral is @xmath122 .",
    "so the identity of the pions leads to a doubling of the @xmath11 branching ratio and @xmath123 , and likewise for @xmath12 .",

    "coupling constants of mesons need to be adjusted ( within their errors ) to reproduce phase shifts for @xmath11 and @xmath13 and resonance masses and widths for @xmath5 and @xmath31 . as coupling constants increase , phase shifts vary more rapidly with @xmath32 , i.e. resonances become _ narrower_. this is the reverse of what happens for @xmath0 states treated as cdd poles .",
    "it seems likely that this point is at the root of the disagreement between data and the comparisons made here with @xmath0 and @xmath1 models .",
    "oller [ 27 ] makes a comparison with a scheme along these lines where k - matrix elements for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are taken from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "resonances are then generated dynamically .",
    "this gives a more promising agreement with su(3 ) and he claims to obtain reasonable agreement with a @xmath0 nonet .",
    "however , he predicts a coupling of @xmath165 ( which is nearly the same as his @xmath166 ) almost as large as to @xmath6 . the new bes data for @xmath10 rule out that possibility , which would lead to a dramatic fall in the @xmath167 and @xmath11 signals at the @xmath168 threshold .",
    "an important experimental question is whether there is a further @xmath169 state .",
    "this is foreign to jaffe s nonet .",
    "gams have reported tentative evidence for a narrow state in @xmath137 at 1914 mev , almost exactly the @xmath170 threshold [ 28 ] .",
    "they claim @xmath171 .",
    "such a state should decay easily to @xmath137 .",
    "if it were narrow , as gams claim ( @xmath172 mev ) , its decays to @xmath170 would be suppressed by phase space .",
    "this is a similar situation to @xmath10 , which appears as a narrow cusp in @xmath11 , but is much more difficult to observe in @xmath6 , despite strong coupling to that channel .",
    "barberis et al .",
    "[ 29 ] report an @xmath137 enhancement with @xmath173 mev , @xmath174 mev , but favour quantum numbers @xmath175 .",
    "this could well be a different well - known resonance @xmath176 , seen prominently in decays to @xmath11 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "they also see a threshold enhancement in @xmath50 with @xmath179 mev , @xmath180 mev ; this could be @xmath176 ( @xmath0 @xmath181 ) or its well established @xmath182 partner @xmath183 , observed in all of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath137 and @xmath184 with consistent mass and width [ 30 ] .",
    "the key to sorting out this situation is to get high statistics data on @xmath137 with good mass resolution .",
    "there is evidence that @xmath10 must have a substantial @xmath6 cloud , as predicted in section 2 .",
    "the basic pointer to this conclusion is that the ratio @xmath4 is at least a factor 2 larger than can be fitted by either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , conclusions are negative ; but it may be important to know what does not work .",
    "this negative conclusion should not be surprising for @xmath0 , in view of the fact that masses are far from the usual nonet configurations such as @xmath185 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 and @xmath43 .",
    "predictions for relative widths of @xmath8 and @xmath7 fail badly for both @xmath0 and jaffe s model .",
    "meson exchange models fare better in predicting @xmath11 and @xmath13 phase shifts .",
    "these models predict that @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath31 are only just bound .",
    "the large decay widths of @xmath7 and @xmath33 reflect this fact : they decay easily to lighter @xmath186 and @xmath13 systems .",
    "an approach along these lines will be considered in a separate paper .",
