    "the diffuse optical extensions were first discovered by @xcite and subsequently the rich system of shells around the elliptical galaxy was detected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discovered the optical jet or filaments in ngc  5128 . the origin and the nature of the emission - line filaments have been hotly debated @xcite .",
    "the origin of diffuse shells @xcite can be explained with phase wrapping of stars from an accreted disk galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the stellar populations in the prominent diffuse north - eastern shell and in the halo of ngc  5128 .",
    "the ` outer filament ' situated at @xmath5 from the centre extends for @xmath6 in the direction of position angle @xmath7 @xcite overlaping partially with the diffuse stellar shell . while the stellar populations in the shell are similar to the rest of the halo of the giant elliptical , the stars close to the emission - line filament are predominantly young ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the ` inner filament ' is located at the distance of @xmath8 from the nucleus and extends outward over @xmath9 at a position angle @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it consists of three bright knots , identified as a , b and c by @xcite and two more diffuse structures , e and f @xcite . here",
    "we report the detection of a young stellar population associated with the optical emission - line inner ( @xmath11 ) and outer ( @xmath12 ) filaments in the north - eastern halo of ngc  5128 . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt distance modulus to ngc  5128 of 27.8 @xcite that corresponds to a distance @xmath13  mpc . at this distance",
    ", @xmath14 on the sky translates to 1.047 kpc in the galaxy .",
    "we used fors1 at vlt antu to image the outer field because it is less crowded and the filaments cover a larger area than in the inner field . on the contrary in the inner field",
    "magellan  i was necessary because despite of having a smaller area it gives higher resolution for the crowded field .",
    "the field with the inner filaments ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) was imaged with the magellan  i ( walter baade ) telescope , one of the twin 6.5 m magellan telescopes at cerro manqui at the las campanas observatory .",

    "additional photometric standards in these fields were defined by @xcite in the @xmath0 and @xmath26 bands , making the total number of useful standard stars observed 15 , 50 and 48 in @xmath25 , @xmath0 and @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "they consist of pairs of 15-min optical ( bessel @xmath25- and @xmath0-band ) exposures taken in photometric conditions with seeing ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the fors1 detector has pixel scale of @xmath36/pixel and the field of view @xmath37 .",

    "the final photometric catalogue of of the inner filament field contains 1612 , 8003 and 7683 stars with good photometry in the @xmath25 , @xmath0 and @xmath26 bands , respectively .",
    "in fig .  [ uvcmds ] we compare the uv color - magnitude diagrams of the inner and outer filament fields . the much larger field of vlt than magellan  i and the more extended star formation region in the outer field accounts for higher number of blue stars with colors @xmath39 . in both fields",
    "there is a young blue main sequence extending to magnitudes of @xmath40 .",
    "we `` cleaned '' the cmds from foreground contamination using the besanon group model of stellar populations in the galaxy .",
    "some of the stars in the red part ( @xmath41 ) of the cmd are most probably still the remaining galactic foreground stars , but in that area of the cmd supergiants on their blue  red excursions are also located ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the blue to red supergiant loops in the red part constrains the abundance , while the brightness of the main sequence stars constrains the age of the population . in order to determine an upper limit for the temperature and ionizing fluxes of the stars we assumed the age and abundance from the isochrone fitting .",
    "the best fit from the available set of padova isochrones @xcite is obtained for z=0.004 and the log(age@xmath42  yr . the brightest stars in both fields are lying along the @xmath4 yr old isochrone . assuming then that the brightest stars have z=0.004 and log(age)=7.0 - 7.1 yr , the temperature of the most luminous stars is between @xmath43 and @xmath44  k.    the comparison with another halo field in the southern region of the galaxy ( field  2 in @xcite ) indicates that the young population is confined to the regions aligned with the optical filaments .",
    "the ( u - v ) vs. ( v - i ) color - color diagram for all the stars in the inner filament field with photometric errors @xmath45 mag and magnitudes brighter than 50% completeness limits in all bands is presented in fig .",
    "[ ccduvi ] .",
    "the foreground stars have not been subtracted .",
    "they form the sequence that crosses the diagram from upper right towards lower left corner .",
    "the objects in the lower left part of the color - color diagram are young supergiants in ngc  5128 .",
    "the spread is due to possible differential reddening and spread in ages of the young stars .",
    "most galaxies have @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite , so only few of them at higher redshift may contribute to the spread in the bluest part of the color - color diagram .",
    "the isolated point to the left of the stellar sequence at @xmath48 and @xmath49 is most probably a galaxy .",
    "absence of other points with similar colors indicate a good selection criteria and low contamination by background galaxies in our stellar photometry .",
    "the reddening value inferred from the isochrone fitting to the stellar sequence is @xmath50 in good agreement with the values from the literature @xcite .",
    "the width of the young blue sequence is somewhat larger in the inner than in the outer filament field .",
    "this may indicate the presence of the small differential reddening amounting at most to @xmath51 .",
    "however , a possible spread in ages of young stars and the photometric errors at fainter magnitudes complicate the interpretation .",
    "the photometry of knot a @xcite , a possible compact star forming region in the jet , required particular care .",
    "it consists of a mixture of stellar like objects , extended nebular emission and an unresolved background of faint stars . in order to estimate the relative contribution of these components to our photometry",
    ", we deconvolved a small portion of the magellan  i image of @xmath52 arcsec around the brightest hot spot using the mcs deconvolution algorithm @xcite . in this way we obtained a new image with improved spatial resolution ( fig .",
    "[ knota ] , top right ) and a background map ( or the `` extended source channel '' ) containing the extended sources .",
    "the final pixel scale on the deconvolved image is @xmath53 and the resolution of point sources is @xmath19 .    in the mcs algorithm",
    ", one has to give as an input , initial estimated positions and intensities for all suspected point sources .",
    "the program then iteratively changes them while trying to deconvolve the data .",
    "the difference between the data and the deconvolved image ( reconvolved back with the psf ) in units of the noise , is used to check the quality of the process , a posteriori . this difference image or residual map",
    "should be flat and equal to 1 everywhere in the field in case of perfect deconvolution . since introducing a higher number of point sources in the image will always produce a better result",
    ", we deliberately choose the minimum number of point sources required for the deconvolution process to yield acceptable residual maps .",
    "some faint stars in the deconvolved image are therefore present in the `` extended source channel '' of the data and we `` see '' fewer stars with the deconvolution process than with allframe . however , the stars we see are decontaminated from the extended underlying nebular emission and we can infer their magnitudes and colors with no contribution from the emission of the surrounding gas .",
    "the comparison between these new measurements and the photometry obtained with allframe ( fig .",
    "[ knota ] ) indicates that the magnitudes and colors of blue stars measured with allframe are not excessively contaminated by line emission from the surrounding gas .",
    "in particular we show that knot a is composed of at least two point sources embedded in a more extended envelope , possible nebular emission or a very compact and still unresolved cluster .",
    "other objects in the field do not show such extended emission apart from the compact object @xmath54 arcsec sw of knot a. the residual flux of knot a after star subtraction is @xmath55 erg/@xmath56/sec /  .",
    "many high - redshift radio galaxies show optical images elongated in the same direction as their double radio sources , the so called alignment effect @xcite .",
    "the alignment has often been explained with models of star formation induced by shocks associated with the passage of radio components @xcite , but in some cases scattering of nuclear light by dust or electrons and line - emission excited by the continuum from the obscured active nucleus are dominating optical and uv light @xcite . in ngc  5128",
    "we can observe in more detail physical processes that are acting in these more distant galaxies .",
    "the direct observations of young blue supergiants associated with the outer filaments were recently reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "now for the first time we have resolved the young stars associated with the ionized filaments and knots in the inner part of the galaxy , and mapped these young stars over a large field along the radio jet .",
    "the remarkable alignment of the young stars and ionized gas over @xmath57  kpc is shown in fig .",
    "[ blue_red_inner ] and [ blue_red_outer ] .",
    "the red stars ( @xmath58 ) are evenly distributed in both fields as expected for foreground galactic stars , while almost all recently formed stars lie along the knots and filaments of ionized gas .",
    "the north - south ( vertical ) alignment in the outer field is along the eastern edge of the h  i cloud that is associated with the stellar shells @xcite .",
    "we checked the locations of all of the blue stars and in particular of the most luminous ones . in the outer field",
    "they are evenly distributed along the star forming region , while the four brightest blue stars in the inner field lie within a very small region , known as knot a @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the spectrum of the knot a shows characteristics of a normal h  ii region and conclude that there must be hot stars embedded in that gas .",
    "we resolved here the brightest stars in that h  ii region .",
    "the northern extension of knot a is distinguished by a higher excitation and electron temperature similar to what is observed in other knots and filaments in the inner and outer halo @xcite .",
    "the high excitation lines observed to be prominent in the filaments in the halo of ngc  5128 ( e.g. he  ii @xmath594686 and high ratio of [ oiii ] @xmath595007/[oii ] @xmath593727@xmath60 ) show that the stars can not be the only source of ionizing photons .",
    "the complex velocity field of the filaments creates a puzzle .",
    "the spectroscopy of the ionized gas revealed a very wide range of velocities covering more than 550 km s@xmath61 @xcite and varying significantly on scales of @xmath62  pc .",
    "the mean velocity of the gas , around @xmath63 km s@xmath61 , is a few hundred km s@xmath61 lower than the systemic velocity of the central region @xcite , but is close to the measured velocity of the h  i cloud that is located to the nw of the outer filaments @xcite .",
    "if the stars shared the turbulent velocities of the gas , in @xmath4 yr they would travel @xmath64  kpc , which correspond to approx .",
    "@xmath65 at the distance of ngc  5128 ( note that the field of view of magellan is less than @xmath66 and that of vlt @xmath67 ) .",
    "if they had these velocities , the gas and the stars would have been dispersed in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the large amount of the h  i and co gas @xcite and its association with the diffuse stellar shells in the halo can be interpreted with the dynamical scenario of phase - wrapping , following the merger of a spiral galaxy with ngc  5128 approximately @xmath68 yr ago @xcite . the similar mean velocity of the h  i cloud and the ionized gas in the filaments indicates the common origin of the gas .",
    "we detect here for the first time the young stars associated with the inner filaments .",
    "their strong alignment with the line emitting filaments and with the radio and x - ray jet coming from the agn nucleus of ngc  5128 suggests a connection between them and poses interesting questions like `` did the jet trigger the star formation ? '' or `` are the jets seen because of the star formation ? '' and `` would we see the jet if there were no blue stars there ? '' .",
    "the answer to the first question is more complex and thus we address the others first .",
    "if we assume that the brightest stars have ages of @xmath69  myr and metallicities of z=0.004 , then they have temperatures of @xmath70  k. the high excitation lines observed in the spectra of the ionized gas require ionization temperatures of the order of @xmath71  k. it is clear that an additional ionization mechanism is exciting the gas . the alignment of the ionized gas with the direction towards the nucleus of the galaxy and the fact that even though it is present , the gas in the other parts of the halo of ngc  5128 is not ionized , leaves as the most simple possibility either an interaction with the radio jet that leads to the shock excitation @xcite or photoionization by the radiation field of a nuclear continuum source @xcite . in any case , the `` jet '' of optical emission line features is not seen due to the star formation and it would most probably be visible even if the stars were not there .    the young stars formed after the collapse of the gas probably have the same origin as the h  i and molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the presence of this cool gas , with @xmath72  k , is the necessary ingredient in the jet induced star formation models . in the model described by @xcite",
    "the prime effect of the radio outburst in a galaxy would be to heat the surrounding medium and evacuate the radio lobe of thermal gas .",
    "however , it would not disturb the cool - phase clouds , which would then be triggered to collapse in the overpressured medium .",
    "so , the jet could have induced the collapse and the star formation without transferring to the stars the high turbulent velocities that are observed today in the gas .",
    "the star formation process driven by the external pressure may not be dissimilar from the one observed in the classical stellar associations , such as orion .",
    "this means that one needs to find an alternative mechanism in order to explain the velocities of the gas that have been observed .",
    "one possibility is that supernova explosions induced shocks into the surrounding medium .",
    "however , the problem with this scenario is that the first generation of supernovae would explode some @xmath73 yr after the onset of the star formation .",
    "so , the gas would acquire the high velocities still @xmath74 million years ago and would have had plenty of time to disperse .",
    "it would have too low density and would probably not be visible any more .",
    "thus either the first supernovae were not efficient enough to blow away all the gas or some new gas came from elsewhere . also , the jet that triggered the star formation would have induced high velocities in the hot gas , which would then have plenty of time to disperse in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the obvious source of the new gas is the close - by h  i cloud that will continue to supply fresh material that can be ionized as long as it stays in the direction of the jet .",
    "the inner and the outer filaments are not mutually aligned .",
    "similarly the inner and the outer radio jets are misaligned .",
    "if we assume that the jet is precessing as suggested also by @xcite , it should have first hit the outer filament and precess in the eastward direction hitting later the inner filament field .",
    "the recent observations of the radio jet with vlbi @xcite and the x - ray jet with chandra @xcite show close alignment with the inner filaments at the position angle of @xmath10 .",
    "stars in the inner and the outer filament have the same ages to within our precision , of the order of @xmath75  yr .",
    "the distance between the inner and the outer filaments is @xmath76 , implying the projected precession rate of the the order of @xmath77 degrees per year .",
    "the presence of the large quantity of neutral gas towards the west of the outer filament implies that either the jet is precessing in a cone whose right edge does not pass the outer filaments on the west or that it is intermittent and started shining only @xmath78  yr ago .",
    "given the facts that the blue stars are aligned along the direction of the jet , that they have formed recently , that there is a lot of gas all over the halo of the galaxy @xcite , but new stars are formed only where the jet passes across or close to that gas , we can conclude that the young stars observed in the filaments in the ne halo of ngc  5128 are result of the jet induced star formation . the optical emission from the gaseous filaments associated with those stars",
    "is mainly powered by the radiation field of the hidden nuclear continuum source @xcite or by the shock excitation due to the interaction of the radio jet with a dense cloud of material at the location of the filaments @xcite .",
    "if this cause - effect scenario is correct , we can put a lower limit to the age of the jet itself : it must have been acting for at least @xmath4  yr in order to form the stars observed .",
    "we have used the direct camera at the magellan  i and fors1 at antu vlt to measure the stellar photometry in two fields in the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 .",
    "the fields were located at the position of the inner and outer optical filaments @xcite .",
    "we detected the chain of blue stars aligned with the line - emitting filaments and with the radio jet .",
    "the main conclusions from this work are :    * we see young blue stars aligned with the jet over @xmath57  kpc . *",
    "the young stars have ages of @xmath4  yr and their uv color - magnitude diagram is best fit with padova isochrones @xcite for abundance of z=0.004 . *",
    "the jet triggered star formation in the halo of ngc  5128 , presumably when hitting dense clouds of neutral gas left in the halo by the previous accretion event @xcite .",
    "* the main excitation mechanism that ionizes the gas associated with the young stars is either beamed photoionization from the obscured agn @xcite or shock ionization by the radio jet @xcite .",
    "the young stars with temperatures of the order of @xmath70  k contribute only a smaller part of ionizing photons .",
    "* our results support the alignment effect observed in high redshift radio galaxies , and suggest that radio galaxies should have higher than normal star formation rates .",
    "* there is evidence for the jet to be processing from the outer to inner filament field eastward in the sky .",
    "* we infer a lower limit for the age of the jet as @xmath4 yr .",

    "<S> young stars in the inner filament field are found inside the bright knots of photoionized gas and are strongly aligned in the direction towards the center of the galaxy at the same position angle as the inner radio jet . fitting the padova isochrones on uv color - magnitude diagrams </S>",
    "<S> we find that the blue stars around the inner filaments have ages similar to the ones around the outer filaments @xmath2  myr and the same abundance of z=0.004 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of young blue supergiants clearly shows that the bright blue knots in the north - eastern halo of ngc  5128 are associations of young stars with photoionized gas . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the brightest stars is t@xmath3  k , insufficient to account alone for the high excitation lines observed in the surrounding ionized gas . </S>",
    "<S> thus the optical emission jet is principally seen due to its alignment with the radio structure of the agn . </S>",
    "<S> the highly collimated star formation is present only in the north eastern halo of the galaxy , suggesting the interaction of the jet with the gas clouds deposited during the last accretion event as the preferred triggering mechanism . from these observations </S>",
    "<S> we infer a lower limit for the age of the ngc  5128 jet of @xmath4  yr . </S>",
    "<S> the triggering of the star formation in the dense clouds in the halo of the galaxy by the jet supports the alignment effect observed in high redshift radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it also suggests that radio galaxies should have higher than normal star formation rates . </S>"
