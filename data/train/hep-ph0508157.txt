    "<S> @xcite , in which they take @xmath131 gev . </S>",
    "<S> their tree - level evaluation of the soft form factor corresponds to @xmath132 , while our evaluation is about 0.01 ( @xmath133 gev ) and 0.05 ( @xmath134 gev ) , which is smaller by an order of magnitude . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , we obtain @xmath137 in our evaluation with @xmath138 gev , @xmath139 gev , close to the result in ref .  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly comment on the higher - order corrections to the tree - level relation in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we have to include the radiative correction to @xmath140 , which include the radiative corrections of @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also have to include the spectator interactions . </S>",
    "<S> when we consider a hard collinear gluon exchange with the spectator quark , the contributions can be separated into two parts , the soft form factor @xmath77 and the hard form factor @xmath142 , based on the existence of the spin symmetry of the heavy - to - light current @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hard spectator contributions for @xmath77 satisfying the spin symmetry can be distinguished simply by the presence of the leading order current @xmath141 in the time - ordered product @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we need to include the higher order interaction terms of @xmath11 collinear lagrangian in the correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin symmetry breaks down explicitly if subleading currents with @xmath143 are included in the time - ordered product . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when the hard spectator contributions for @xmath142 are considered , we have to define a correlation function with the subleading current @xmath144 , which is given by @xmath145 in this case , the intermediate state consists of hard - collinear particles and one of the correlation functions is given by @xmath146    @xmath147 is the ultrasoft - collinear lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation function contributes to the hard form factor . after integrating out the hard - collinear degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> , we have four - quark operators with @xmath148 and @xmath149 . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , from the four possible contractions of the hard - collinear particles in the intermediate state we obtain the operators in @xmath150 of the form @xmath151 where @xmath152/2 $ ] , and @xmath153 , @xmath8 are color indices . in addition , we also have to consider the possibilities that the hard - collinear loop diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] can be matched onto the nonlocal time - ordered products such as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] in @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> when calculating the hard - collinear loop corrections , we are confronted with non - vanishing infrared divergences which result from internal propagators with virtualities of order @xmath90 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we expect the infrared divergences will be reproduced by the possible nonlocal time - ordered products in @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by matching onto @xmath150 , we obtain @xmath154|\\overline{b } \\rangle + \\cdots ,    \\label{hard1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath155 are the jet functions and @xmath156 denotes convolutions of @xmath157 which can appear in the operators @xmath158 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements between the @xmath1 meson in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hard1 ] ) are new nonperturbative parameters to be included by defining additional subleading shape functions of the @xmath1 meson . similarly , there are also hard spectator contributions to @xmath77 from other time - ordered products with the subleading collinear lagrangian , which introduce more nonperturbative parameters . however , we have no information on these subleading @xmath1 meson shape functions , and hence we do not further consider higher - order corrections and other theoretical uncertainties such as the renormalization scale dependence in this paper .    we have derived the tree - level relation between the soft form factor for @xmath159 and the leading @xmath1 meson shape function using the sum rule approach . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by considering the forward scattering amplitude of the heavy - to - light current near the endpoint . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a constraint on the behavior of the @xmath1 meson shape function near the endpoint using the scaling behavior of the soft form factor , @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> since we work at tree level only , there may be a lot of uncertainties , and there may also be a model dependence on the form of the shape function . </S>",
    "<S> but the analysis suggests that the soft form factor can be about 0.01 to 0.07 , considering various inputs from the models and using the experimental data on the @xmath1 meson shape function . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the soft form factor is approximately smaller by an order of magnitude than other sum rule predictions . </S>",
    "<S> since we have not included higher - order corrections in @xmath94 , this evaluation may have a large theoretical uncertainty , but our analysis favors a small value of the soft form factor . </S>"
