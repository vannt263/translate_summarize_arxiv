    "attracts much attention , because it is related to many interesting issues on the internal structure of nucleon resonances , such as the mixing angles  @xcite and multiquark components  @xcite .",
    "the substantial branching ratio of the @xmath10 decay channel still remains to be fully understood , but it facilitates measurements of the @xmath5 production processes , given that from threshold up to roughly 200 mev above , the reaction mechanism is dominated by @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , those reactions offer the possibility of also investigating the properties of other nucleon resonances and searching for still undiscovered ones .",
    "for half a century , hadronic and electromagnetic probes have been used for the @xmath5 production processes , essentially off the nucleon .",
    "the data for @xmath11 come mainly from measurements performed in 70s  @xcite and suffer from some inconsistencies  @xcite , except a recent experiment performed at bnl , using the crystal ball spectrometer  @xcite .",

    "recent data extending the phase space up to @xmath212.8 gev renders the degenerate approximation less reliable .",
