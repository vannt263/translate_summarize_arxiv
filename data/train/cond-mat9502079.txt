    "it seems ( see refs .

    "the density of states is a fluctuating quantity which consists of a leading part @xmath18 and a remainder    [ eq:7 ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 is equal to the average with respect to the disorder .",
    "note that in the literature , the following abbreviation occurs quite frequently @xmath21    ( one level correlation functions ) ; and if systematics is required , we will resort to that terminology .",
    "we mention in passing that in some problems where no disorder appears explicitly , the average can be taken with respect to an energy window or it may represent a kind of integration with respect to quantum numbers .    as a rule",
    ", @xmath22 is insensitive to genuine quantum phenomena which may result e.g. from an applied magnetic field or from a magnetic flux threading a mesoscopic ring .",
    "if this is the case , the disorder averaged grand canonical potential @xmath23 \\label{8}\\ ] ] has lost any sensitive dependence on external parameters .",
    "indeed , this turns out to be true as far as the response ( persistent currents ) to magnetic flux of mesoscopic rings is concerned . on the other hand , it is found that there is a measurable effect in a theory where the number of electrons is kept fixed [ 2,7 ] .",
    "\\(c ) the fact that the sensitive part of @xmath24 is , on the average , zero does not mean that @xmath24 is zero for each realization .",

    "the simplest quantity which can be used as a measure of the stochastic ( sample to sample ) fluctuations , is the mean square value . in previous publications",
    "( see references in [ 3 ] ) , it has been considered to be sufficient for non - interacting electrons , to calculate the mean square @xmath25 , which means stochastic fluctuations at fluctuating numbers of electrons .",
    "we will show how stochastic fluctuations can be calculated for fixed number of electrons .",

    "thermodynamic properties ( a ) of mesoscopic systems with fixed number of electrons are investigated in section ii , iii , and iv on the basis of ( i ) legendre transformation ; ( ii ) coulomb blockade ; and ( iii ) pinning of the fermi level to a single particle state .",
    "section v is devoted to the problem of photoabsorption , whereas , stochastic fluctuations are studied in section vi .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in section vii .",
    "appendix a presents a calculation of correlation functions in the cooperon - diffuson approximation for persistent currents and appendix b contains a collection of results of the random matrix theory .",
    "the mathematical conveniences provided by the grand canonical ensemble ( fluctuating number of particles ) are evident and there is no need to consult text books .",
    "certainly , there are differences in the results obtained for the above mentioned ensemble and the canonical ensemble ( fixed number of particles ) but they are said to become relatively small in the thermodynamic limit .    however , there are phenomena in mesoscopic systems which depend only on a relatively small number of electrons .",
    "this suggests that one should work entirely within the canonical ensemble ; in fact , this retriction should be taken very serious since in all processes the particle number is conserved .    at low temperatures ( at @xmath33 , to be precise )",
    "where thermal fluctuations are negligeable , the grand canonical potential @xmath34 and the free energy @xmath35 are directly related by a legendre transformation .",
    "however , this is true only before the averages with respect to the disorder have been taken ; therefore , the transformation has to be done for each realization of the disorder separately .",
    "this program can be carried through comparably easy , on the basis of the decomposition ( 7 ) , provided that the fluctuating part @xmath36 in the density of states is small .",
    "we will find that the first nontrivial correction is of second order in @xmath37 . in",
    "what follows , we will relax the condition @xmath33 and we will perform the legendre transformation from @xmath38 to @xmath39 on the basis of the above mentioned expansion [ 7 ] .    in this context , it is convenient to formulate the legendre transformation as follows @xmath40 clearly , a necessary condition for a maximum is @xmath41 corresponding to the decomposition ( 7 ) of the density of states we have @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is given in eq .",

    "we expect that for large separation of the energies the correlations vanish .",
    "hence , @xmath62 in general , we expect only a weak dependence on the absolute values of the energies ; hence , for energies near the fermi level , the correlator may be assumed to depend only on the energy difference @xmath63 where the second line follows from the symmetry @xmath64 .    making use of eq .",

    "( [ 27 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath65 in the limit @xmath66 , the expression simplifies to @xmath67 in retrospect , one comment is in order",
    ". we should recognize that the two energy integrations in the expression for @xmath68 collect contributions from a large range of order fermi energy .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious that the translational invariant form ( 26 ) , for the correlator , is admissible . for justification ,",
    "note that firstly , the application of the sum rule ( 25 ) allows to introduce substantial restrictions in one energy integration .",
    "still , the one energy integration in eq .",
    "( 28 ) may diverge .",
    "there , we should keep in mind that , we are interested here in quantum effect which occur at low energies . therefore , it is possible to subtract irrelevant parts and to arrive at a convergent expression one is interested in .    for a demonstration ,",
    "see the discussion on persistent currents , where a metallic ring is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath69 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "there , it is found that the phase sensitive part of @xmath59 is periodic in @xmath69 with period @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the flux quantum .",
    "it is also found that the fourier components of @xmath59 , that is , the phase sensitive parts of @xmath59 , are of the order of the mean level spacing @xmath72 .",

    "( 22 )  is taken into account .",

    "we wish to add that it is quite legitimate  if not obvious  to consider the mesoscopic sample connected to an electron reservoir .",
    "of course , differences in the work function between reservoir and sample  which occur in a real situation  may require a proper redefinition of the typical fermi level @xmath31 .",
    "the theory which we will put down below is based on a statistical concept of the filling factors of a fermi system in the presence of disorder . at @xmath33 , that is , in the ground state ,",
    "all single particle levels are fully occupied which satisfy @xmath101 ; the remaining levels @xmath102 are unoccupied .",
    "of course , the fermi energy @xmath103 has to be chosen such that the particle number @xmath76 which follows from this choice , satisfies the specifications .",
    "at that point one may ask : what are the specifications ? in a mesoscopic sample of size , say 10@xmath104 atomic distances , is there the number of electrons exactly 10@xmath105 , or perhaps 10@xmath105 + 10@xmath106 ( 10@xmath107 , 10@xmath108 , 10@xmath104 , ... ) ?",
    "physical considerations suggest that the result should not depend on such details .",
    "therefore , we propose to average with respect to the particle number in a reasonable window . a convenient way to realize such an ensemble will be to select fermi - energies at random such that @xmath109 where @xmath110 may be any level in a reasonable range ( which will be specified below ) ; and where @xmath16 is a positive infinitesimal [ 9 ] .",
    "the above choice implies that the levels @xmath111 only are occupied ; and that the remaining ones are empty .",
    "we will call this construction the fermi - level pinning ensemble ( flpe ) .    at that point",
    ", one may ask : what is the difference then of this ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble ?",
    "the answer is implicitly given by arguments found in ref .",
    "accordingly , the grand canonical ensemble ( gce at @xmath33 ) may be characterized by a random selection of the chemical potential .",
    "this implies that the transition from the last occupied level to the first unoccupied one will preferably take place when the energetic distance is large .",
    "in contrast to it , the ensemble ( flpe ) introduced above guarantees that such a transition occurs between any pair of levels with equal probability .",
    "again , we start from the expression ( 1 ) for the grand canonical ensemble ; however , we wish to add that only the limit @xmath112 ( ground state ) is , strictly speaking , consistent with the argumentation above .",

    "therefore , we remove the arbitrariness in the selection of the pinning level @xmath110 by sampling with a weight function @xmath114 which is centered at the typical fermi energy , that is , @xmath115 ( see eq .

    "comparing the structure of @xmath143 and of @xmath144 , one recognizes that such a symmetry exists at @xmath33 . for @xmath145 ,",

    ", we have to point out one peculiarity of the fermi - level pinning ensemble .",
    "we should not expect any change in the final result if the selection @xmath147 of eq .",
    "( 39 ) is replaced by @xmath148 .",
    "this expectation is supported by the fact that the energy levels as a function of @xmath130 do not cross in disordered ( `` chaotic '' ) systems .",

    "( 8) , ( 43 ) and ( 50 ) . similarly , the second last term of eq .",
    "( 8) contributes with @xmath207 .    at this , we recall that ultimately , we are interested in the correlator of the physical quantity @xmath190 .",
    "this means that we should calculate @xmath208 ( the subscript @xmath151 indicates how the average is taken and @xmath153 is the parameter value at which the fermi level pinning ensemble has been prepared . )",
    "it is now important to realize that terms of the type ( 81 ) do not contribute to the correlator ( 82 ) .    for sake of transparent formulae ,",
    "we will omit terms of the type ( 81 ) ; in the following equalities are meant to be relations of equivalence in the sense of eq .",
    "therefore , we may write @xmath209\\big)\\big(\\ell n \\big[1 + e^{-(e{'}-\\mu)/t}\\big]\\big ) \\label{83}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that for @xmath112 , the last factors in the integrand are @xmath210 where @xmath211 are energies measured from the fermi level as defined in eq . ( 62 ) . clearly , large values of @xmath212 are important in the integral ( 83 ) , and a simple rmt theory fails if not a prescription how to extract phase sensitive contribution is supplied . as an alternative , one may resort to the diagrammatic theory and to the cooperon - diffuson expansion .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggests that the expression ( 83 ) is of the order @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the circumference and @xmath215 the mean free path of the metallic ring .",
    "furthermore , @xmath216 the rate at which phase coherence is destroyed . since @xmath217",
    ", the estimate above indicates that in metals of short mean free path the stochastic fluctuations may be considerably larger within the fermi level pinning ensemble , that is , when calculated for a fixed number of electrons as compared with calculations for fluctuating number of electrons .",
    "we recall the discussion on the existence and on the size of persistent currents in mesoscopic metallic rings threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath69 which took place just a few years ago [ 2 ] .",
    "it has been found that for non - interacting electrons , the persistent currents are exponentially small [ 13 ] when calculated for the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) in contrast to calculations for the canonical ensemble ( ce ) .",
    "there one finds persistent currents , ( when expressed in terms of energies ) of order @xmath72 , that is , the mean spacing of the electronic level .",
    "nevertheless , even this result is small and it is presumably correct to say that the size of the persistent currents depends on just one electron .    in such a case , it is necessary to have reliable information on the distribution of the electronic levels @xmath0 .",
    "a basic assumption is that atomic disorder or fluctuations in the geometric definitions exist in all samples which are prepared identically on a mesoscopic scale .",
    "correlation functions ( with respect to this disorder ) , of these levels can be calculated in an approximation by a diagrammatic method [ 14 ] or in the random matrix theory [ 11,12 ] .",
    "a comprehensive approach is provided by the supersymmetry technique [ 15 ] , but technically , it is not so easy to handle .      concerning ( a ) , there is no need to emphasize , that for systems of identical particles , a theory can be formulated and carried through most elegantly in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "thus , there is a possibility ( i ) to extract from this information thus obtained the canonical ensemble by a legendre transformation . in a second procedure ( ii ) , one starts from the idea of a coulomb blockade where the charging energy @xmath218 ( @xmath74 is the capacitance of the mesoscopic sample ) fixes the number of electrons to be equal to the ( effective ) number of ions provided that @xmath219 . a third possibility ( iii )",
    "is based on the concept of pinning the fermi level to a single particle level . in this context ,",
    "one argues that effectively the grand canonical ensemble can be understood as a random selection of fermi energies which prefers configurations where the energy separation between last occupied and first empty state is large .",
    "in contrast to it , the fermi level pinning ensemble provides an unbiased choice .    by and large",
    "we have found that ( at @xmath33 ) the three methods do lead to the same result as far as the thermodynamics is concerned .",
    "one open question remains . in terms of persistent current : is there a difference in the persistent currents of a flux @xmath69 when the system has been prepared at a flux @xmath220 ? some comments can be found at the end of appendix a. in this context , the following problem ( which at first sight seems to be none at all ) , should also be considered .",
    "we recall eq .",
    "( 15 ) where @xmath31 is defined by @xmath221 .",
    "a relation of similar structure is eq .",
    "the question is : how is it possible to find @xmath31 such that @xmath76 is an integer ?",
    "clearly , within the present formalism , we can not guarantee @xmath76 to be an integer . on the other hand",
    ", such a detail may be very important since we have convinced ourselves that it may be only one electron which contributes to the phenomenon we are interested in .",
    "as an example of dynamics ( b ) , we have studied the disorder average cross section @xmath17 for the photoabsorption of a mesoscopic sample as proposed in ref . [ 1 ] . according to a qualitative analysis of shklovskii [ 1 ] ,",
    "the cross section @xmath17 is reduced by a factor @xmath222 ( @xmath223 for small frequencies ) as compared with a naive calculation in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we have calculated @xmath17 using the concept ( iii ) of fermi level pinning .",
    "there , we have obtained agreement with shklovskii s ideas within the random matrix theory .",
    "furthermore , the present theory allows us to cover all frequencies .",
    "it seems to be tempting to calculate photoabsorption within the coulomb blockade concept ( ii ) .",
    "however , in a naive treatment , correlation functions of very high order @xmath224 seems to be required ; a situation which calls for a more detailed discussion . in this context , we wish to mention also an approach to this dynamic problem which has been put forward by kamenev et al .",
    "[ 16 ] , which agrees with the limiting form proposed by shklovskii [ 1 ] .",
    "stochastic fluctuations ( c ) seem to be very important in mesoscopic physics . though the average response may be small , there are in general large sample to sample fluctuations of this response . as a simple measure of these fluctuations ,",
    "the root - mean - square of the response is most useful .",
    "usually , the r.m.s is calculated within the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we have studied this quantity for fermi level pinning ensemble ( iii ) . in the case of persistent currents",
    ", we have outlined an estimate which indicates a considerable enhancement is possible in the fluctuations of persistent currents , when calculated for fixed number of electrons .    at the end",
    ", we wish to draw attention to measurements where the magnetic moment of ( singly connected ) mesoscopic samples has been measured by lvy et al .",
    "[ 17 ] . again",
    ", the question of differences between canonical and grand canonical ensemble arises . in the presence of strong disorder ( diffusive limit ) , the paper by altshuler et al .",
    "[ 18 ] , seems to provide a complete answer . on the other hand , if there is only weak atomic disorder , the problem is more complicated [ 19 ] .",
    "a new physical situation arises when samples are free from intrinsic defects ( aharonov - bohm ballistic billiards ) , and where disorder appears only in the form of differences in the geometric definitions of the samples .",
    "this situation has been discussed by ullmo et al .",
    "[ 20 ] . we , together with yu .",
    "n. ovchinnikov , are also working on this problem , analytically as well as numerically .",
    "it seems to be a very difficult problem ; one could say , that it means to catch the one active electron among the million inert ones .",
    "a.s . wishes to thank a. kamenev and y. gefen for stimulating discussions during his stay at the weizmann institute .",
    "in fact , these discussions have initiated the investigation of this paper .",
    "in addition , it is a pleasure to acknowledge illuminating comments by a. mirlin .",
    "this work has been supported by the german - israeli foundation ( gif ) .      according to altshuler and shklovskii [ 14 ] ,",
    "the two level correlation functions can be expanded in two types of impurity ladder diagrams that are called diffusons and cooperons . for this expansion to be valid",
    ", a condition has to be satisfied which is that the energetic separation of the two levels to be considered has to be much larger than the mean level separation @xmath225 in the framework of this diagramatic theory , one obtains a two - diffuson contribution which is as follows @xmath226 ^ 2 } \\label{a2}\\ ] ] in the relation above , @xmath227 represents the eigenvalues of the diffusion operator @xmath228 for the sample in consideration and @xmath216 means the rate at which phase coherence is destroyed . in case of time reversal symmetry , the two - cooperon contributions @xmath229 is the same as expression ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "we call a sample to be effectively of zero dimension if the zero eigenvalue of @xmath228 is the only important one . in this case",
    "@xmath230 according to the definition ( 24 ) , the expression ( [ a3 ] ) has to be considered as the two - diffuson approximation of the two - level correlator @xmath231 .",
    "we also observe that this approximation satisfies the sum rule ( 25 ) .",
    "furthermore , it agrees with the gue result ( 65 ) of the random matrix theory for large energy separation @xmath232 , if we replace there the fast oscillatory term @xmath233 by its average value @xmath234 . for small energies , however , the agreement is bad .    as mentioned above , the two - cooperon contribution is the same for a system with perfect time reversal symmetry , @xmath235 . on the other hand ,",
    "if time reversal symmetry is completely lost , the two - cooperon contribution is zero , @xmath236 . in the random matrix theory ,",
    "the two cases correspond to goe and gue , respectively .    despite its deficiency , the cooperon - diffuson expansion is useful since it can easily be generalized to one and higher dimensional samples . in the discussion of persistent currents in metallic rings threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath69",
    ", one considers frequently an effectively one - dimensional closed loop of length @xmath214 ; as a consequence , the eigenvalues @xmath227 of the diffusion operator can be found by replacing      we remark that the ansatz ( a4 ) neglects any penetration of the magnetic field into the area of the metallic ring .",
    "therefore , the cooperon contribution remains oscillating even for very large flux and no transition to the gue ensemble of random matrix theory will take place .",
    "presently , we are interested in the thermodynamics only in so far as the flux dependence is concerned . hence , only the two - cooperon contribution @xmath240 matters .",
    "considering eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 28 ) , we recognize that the @xmath16-function contribution to @xmath241 is irrelevant .",
    "we will also see later , that neither the @xmath242-regularisation of the low energy dependence nor the phase breaking rate @xmath216 is not essential in the present problem .",
    "thus , we may write @xmath243 ^ 2 } \\label{a6}\\ ] ] note that @xmath244 is an even function of @xmath245 ; moreover , it is as periodic in @xmath245 with period @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , a fourier expansion is appropriate and we put @xmath247 ^ 2 } \\label{a7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] explicitly , one finds        we observe that the divergence of @xmath253 is irrelevant in the integration and also , that the integral converges for large values of @xmath254 if @xmath255 .",
    "this last point may be considered as a demonstration of the rule that only low energies ( here : @xmath256 ) contribute to phase sensitive quantities .          following the argumentation which lead to eq . ( 47 ) , we also define a two - level correlator which depends on the two fluxes @xmath69 and @xmath261 . in this case , cooperons as well as diffusons contribute to the phase sensitive quantities ; and we obtain the appropriate correlators if we substitute @xmath262 for cooperons and @xmath263 for diffusons in expression ( [ a7 ] ) .",
    "( note the symmetry @xmath264 . ) from these relations , it follows that @xmath265 \\label{a12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evidently , @xmath266 as expected , the above result agrees with eq .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) only if @xmath267 .",
    "next , we comment the paper of kamenev and gefen [ 10 ] .",
    "they consider an experiment where the system is prepared in a grand canonical state at the flux @xmath268 and then transferred adiabatically to a state with flux @xmath69 .",
    "their result for the persistent current can be expressed as follows @xmath269 in conclusion , we note the interesting relation @xmath270 which we do not understand presently in physical terms .",
    "as far as the problem of stochastic fluctuations is concerned , it is not difficult to calculate the connected part @xmath271 of the correlator for the grand canonical potential in the diffuson - cooperon approximation outlined above ( see also the standard results for noninteracting electrons quoted in ref . [ 3 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , one finds for the grand canonical ensemble at @xmath33 , the following result @xmath272 note that the fluctuations @xmath193 are much larger than the mean values @xmath273 .        in the rmt",

    "we note that in the present problems , these permutations produce analytic forms which are identical .",
    "the three point cummulant can be calculated according to @xmath283 we insert these quantities in equation ( [ b1 ] ) and after some manipulations , we obtain the limiting cases , eq .",
