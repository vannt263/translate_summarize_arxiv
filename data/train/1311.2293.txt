    "in the intermediate energy region of a few gev , the cross sections for charged lepton production are dominated by quasielastic and various inelastic processes involving pion production induced by charged and neutral currents in neutrino and antineutrino reactions from nuclear targets .",
    "the experimental observations of strange particles through weak interaction induced @xmath0 and @xmath6 processes are quite limited .",
    "these are limited both by statistics as well as by the large systematic errors .",
    "also theoretically there are only a few works available in literature .",
    "however , the availability of high intensity neutrino and antineutrino beams in present generation neutrino experiments has opened up the possibility of experimentally studying these processes with better statistics . in this work ,",
    "we summarize our results of the total scattering cross sections for single kaon / antikaon , eta , associated particle production for neutrino / antineutrino induced processes as well as antineutrino induced single hyperon production .",
    "the details of the model are given in refs .",
    "the calculations are performed using a microscopical model based on the chiral perturbation theory(@xmath7 ) at the level of baryon and meson octet  @xcite for the background terms and for @xmath8 production resonant mechanism is introduced by the inclusion of the decuplet baryons  @xcite . for @xmath9 hyperon production cross section induced by antineutrinos we followed the prescription of ref .",

    "the kaon production gets contribution from contact term , kaon pole term , u - channel diagram and pion / eta in flight term  @xcite . for the antikaon production besides the background terms , we have also taken the contribution from lowest lying @xmath3 resonance  @xcite .",
    "we find that the contact term is dominant , followed by the u - channel diagram with a @xmath18 intermediate state and the @xmath19 exchange term .",
    "the kaon pole contributions are negligible .",
    "we have used a global dipole form factor with a mass of 1 gev and multiplied it with the hadronic current .",
    "we observe similar features in the results of antikaon production cross section as in the case of kaon production , and the contribution from @xmath3 resonance is very small .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_ass_xsec ] , we have presented the results for neutrino and antineutrino induced associated kaon production cross section .",
    "we have considered the following reactions for @xmath17 charged current induced associated particle production process :    @xmath20    the various form factors that appear in the vector and axial vector currents have been determined using the prescription given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "also we find that the contact term has the largest contribution to the cross section followed by s - channel and kaon pole terms .",
    "we find that the cross section for the reaction channel with a @xmath18 in the final state are in general larger than that for the reactions where @xmath21 is in the final state .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the relative strength of the coupling , for example , the ratio of couplings squared for the vertices @xmath22 to @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , the cross section for the @xmath18 production is favored by the available phase space due to its small mass relative to @xmath21 baryons .",
    "however , for the antineutrino induced process , the mechanism where @xmath18 is in the final state is not dominating .",
    "we find that the neutrino induced reactions are the dominant source of @xmath25 production whereas antineutrino induced reactions favor @xmath26 production .    in fig .",

    "these processes are generally cabibbo suppressed as compared to @xmath38 production process but could be important in the low energy region of antineutrinos .",

    "furthermore , we find that when the contribution for the pions coming from all the hyperons mentioned in eq.[reaction1 ] is taken together there is no net change in the overall pion production due to final state interaction(fsi ) effects , as it increases in the @xmath18 production and decreases in the @xmath21 production in the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "we observe that in the peak region of @xmath27 distribution , the contribution of @xmath37 from the hyperon excitations is almost 75@xmath40 to the contribution of @xmath37 from the @xmath38 excitation .",
    "similar is the observation for @xmath41 production  @xcite .",
