    "cluster algebras were introduced in 2002 by fomin and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "these cluster algebras are commutative rings @xmath1 that depend on the initial cluster variables @xmath2 , cluster coefficients @xmath3 and a quiver @xmath4 .",
    "the combinatorial structure of these rings is based on a recursive operation called mutation . in this paper , we focus on cluster algebras with principal coefficients because a cluster variable in an arbitrary cluster algebra can be computed from a cluster variable in a corresponding cluster algebra with principal coefficients @xcite .",
    "each iteration of a mutation yields a cluster variable in the form of a laurent polynomial in terms of the initial cluster variables @xmath5 .",
    "the coefficients of the terms in this laurent polynomial are monomials in the cluster coefficients . for each cluster variable",
    "there exists an @xmath0-polynomial obtained from the cluster variable by setting each initial cluster variable , @xmath6 , equal to one .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath0-polynomials are polynomials in the cluster coefficients .    for cluster algebras of surface type , there is a bijection between the arcs @xmath7 on the surface and the cluster variables of the cluster algebra @xcite . from an arc @xmath7 in a triangulated surface",
    ", one can construct a labeled snake graph @xcite .",
    "for our purposes , the labeling of the snake graph is unimportant , however each numbered tile @xmath8 corresponds to the principal coefficient with that subscript , @xmath9 .",
    "this snake graph is useful because there is an expansion formula that gives the cluster variable @xmath10 as a sum over the perfect matchings of the snake graph @xcite .",
    "since the cluster variable @xmath10 can be obtained from the perfect matchings , so can the @xmath0-polynomial of @xmath10 .",
    "theorem 4.1 in @xcite tells us there is a bijection between positive continued fractions and snake graphs . in the same paper",
    "the authors give a formula for the cluster variable of a labeled snake graph in terms of a continued fraction of laurent polynomials in @xmath11 .",
    "however , this formula only works for cluster algebras with trivial coefficients . in this paper , we extend this result to cluster algebras with principal coefficients by giving an explicit formula for the @xmath0-polynomial as a continued fraction of laurent polynomials in @xmath12 .",

    "@xmath17 $ ] , define @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of snake graphs and some of their properties .",
    "first , a tile @xmath21 is a fixed length square in the plane .",
    "the sides of a tile are orthogonal or parallel to a fixed basis , so it is natural for one to call the lower edge the south edge , etc . each tile can either be placed to the right or above the previous tile .",
    "a snake graph @xmath22 is a connected planar graph given by a sequence of tiles @xmath23 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 share exactly one edge , @xmath25 .",
    "the edges @xmath25 that are contained in two tiles are called interior edges . for a snake graph made up of tiles @xmath26 ,",
    "the interior edges are @xmath27 .",
    "all of the other edges are called boundary edges .",
    "a subset @xmath28 of edges of @xmath22 where each vertex in @xmath22 is incident to exactly one edge in @xmath28 is called a perfect matching .",
    "see figure [ fig 234minmatch ] for an example of a perfect matching on a snake graph with 8 tiles , where each tile @xmath23 is labeled by @xmath8 .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed account regarding snake graphs .    in @xcite the authors",
    "establish a bijection between snake graphs and positive continued fractions . the snake graph obtained from the continued fraction",

    "for example the snake graph @xmath32 $ ] , has @xmath33 = 5 $ ] perfect matchings as seen in figure [ fig poset22 ] .",
    "these perfect matchings form a poset ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) with a unique minimal and maximal element .",
    "these minimal and maximal perfect matchings , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , are the only perfect matchings consisting entirely of boundary edges . for consistency",
    ", we adopt the convention that the minimal perfect matching @xmath34 of @xmath29 $ ] is the perfect matching consisting of only boundary edges that also contains the south edge of the first tile .    for two examples of posets of perfect matchings see figures [ fig poset22 ] and [ fig poset4 ] in example [ ex poset ] .",
    "we can climb the poset of perfect matchings from @xmath28 to @xmath36 by turning a tile .",
    "a tile @xmath21 can be turned if two of its edges are in the perfect matching @xmath28 . by turning the tile ,",
    "you replace the two edges of @xmath21 in @xmath28 with the other two edges of @xmath21 and in doing so obtain the perfect matching @xmath36 . the height @xmath37 of @xmath28",

    "the @xmath0-polynomial of @xmath22 is defined as @xmath40 , where the sum is over all perfect matchings of @xmath22 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath22 is the snake graph of a cluster variable in a cluster algebra from a surface then the @xmath0-polynomial of that cluster variable is @xmath41 ( or a specialization of @xmath41 if the corresponding arc crosses a self - folded triangle ) .",
