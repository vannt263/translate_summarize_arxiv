    "with miniaturization of memory devices like the magnetic read head and random access memory , thermal fluctuations start to play non - trivial role in their performance , e.g. , by activating magnetization reversal of ferromagnetic clusters  @xcite .",

    "the thermally induced magnetization fluctuations will act as a fundamental limit to the performance of submicron magnetoresistive devices .",
    "thus , even from the application perspective , it becomes crucial to understand the impact of thermal fluctuations , in order to reliably use small magnetic devices  @xcite .",
    "the simplest component of such magnetic devices is a single magnetic domain , a macrospin .",

    "stochastic counterparts of thermodynamic observables , e.g. , energy , work , heat , and entropy characterizes stochastic trajectories in phase space .",
    "statistical averages of these quantities lead to the corresponding macroscopic thermodynamic observables  @xcite .",
    "several equalities involving the stochastic observables have been derived in the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that negative entropy producing trajectories do occur , but probability of them remains exponentially suppressed with respect to the positive entropy producing trajectories .",
    "the corresponding equality is known as the detailed fluctuation theorem ( dft )  @xcite . a related integral fluctuation theorem ( ift ) , and the jarzynski equality that expresses equilibrium free energy difference in terms of non - equilibrium work done were also derived  @xcite .",
    "many of these theorems have been verified against experiments on colloids and granular matter  @xcite , and successfully used to obtain free energy landscape of bio - polymers like rna  @xcite .",
    "recently , stochastic thermodynamics has been extended to describe active brownian particles that derives their motion using internal energy source or ambient fuel  @xcite .",
    "several active particle dynamics are describable in terms of non - linear velocity dependent forces having odd parity under time - reversal . for these systems , it was shown that the entropy production ( ep ) in the environment has excess contributions , apart from the contribution from dissipated heat  @xcite .",
    "this excess ep is shown to be related to the time reversal symmetry breaking due to the presence of non - linear velocity dependent force , and potential energy of interaction or trapping , together  @xcite .    using a single ising spin undergoing glauber dynamics ,",
    "work distribution functions have been studied earlier , under various protocols of time dependent variation of magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "if the external field is time - independent , such a system reaches an equilibrium boltzmann distribution when coupled to a heat bath .",
    "thus to extract non - equilibrium entropy production , it is imperative to impose a time - dependent field on such a system .",
    "we instead focus on the three dimensional stochastic motion of magnetization of a sufficiently _ small _ single magnetic domain , a macrospin , coupled to a langevin heat bath , under external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "one fundamental difference in dynamics of this system with respect to the ising spin is , the presence of a directed precessional motion around the external field , even if the field is time independent .",
    "thus the system in the presence of a magnetic field is intrinsically out of equilibrium . due to the small system size the dynamics of such a macrospin",
    "is strongly influenced by thermal noise .",
    "we use the langevin and corresponding fokker - planck equations describing stochastic motion of a macrospin under external magnetic field .",
    "the appropriate langevin equation contains multiplicative noise , and the external magnetic field gives rise to a spin torque .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is used to calculate rate of entropy change in the system , which has two terms , one is the ep due to non - equilibrium processes in the system , and another term gives entropy flux to the reservoir .",
    "the derivation clearly shows that the total average ep in the system and reservoir is non - negative , as required by the second law of thermodynamics . using probabilities of stochastic trajectories we derive fluctuation theorems for stochastic ep .",
    "the corresponding expression of ep in the reservoir , @xmath0 , depends on the choice of time - reversed conjugate trajectories , only one of which is consistent with the fokker - planck equation .",
    "a direct derivation of the stochastic energy balance shows that the ep in the environment has an excess contribution , apart from the stochastic version of clausius entropy associated with heat dissipation .",
    "however , this anomaly may be resolved by redefining both the dissipated heat @xmath1 with @xmath2 denoting the temperature of the reservoir , and the stochastic work done on the system , keeping the expression of change in internal energy unchanged . within the redefined form ,",
    "these two terms contain contribution from rotational work done due to torque .",
    "we propose experiments to separately measure heat dissipation and reservoir ep in the presence of spin torque , to test the relation between the two .",
    "such measurements will help to understand stochastic ep better .",
