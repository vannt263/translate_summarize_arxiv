    "the probably simplest example of a semigroup on the space @xmath9 , namely the shift semigroup , fails to be strongly continuous and even measurable with respect to the sup - norm . to overcome this and the probably the more important fact , namely the failure of strong continuity of many transition semigroups ,",
    "several different approaches have been developed , such as those of @xmath10-semigroups by priola @xcite or weakly continuous semigroups by cerrai @xcite .",
    "one could even simply consider other locally convex topologies on @xmath9 than the sup - norm - topology as , e.g. , done by dorroh , neuberger @xcite . a more recent abstract approach is that of _ integrable semigroups on norming dual pairs _",

    "in this paper , we give preference to the notion of _ bi - continuous semigroups _ initiated by khnemund @xcite .",
    "the reason for giving distinction to this class of semigroups is the fact that there is already a vast abstract theory developed for them : there are generation , approximation and perturbation results ( see khnemund @xcite , @xcite and farkas @xcite ) .",

    "phillips functional calculus was formulated in this setting , and was used to prove convergence rates for rational approximation schemes and for efficient laplace inversion formulas , see jara @xcite .",

    "it is the aim of the present note to complement the existing theory of bi - continuous semigroups by the construction of the _ adjoint semigroup _",
    "( this is done in section [ s : adj ] ) .    beside these , recently semigroups on spaces of measures have been attracting much attention , see manca @xcite , lant , thieme @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising , however , that such questions were addressed much earlier , for example by sentilles @xcite , who studied operator semigroups of @xmath6 ( bounded continuous functions ) and on @xmath7 ( bounded measures ) , where @xmath5 is a locally compact space .",
    "the important construction there was that of a _ strict - topology _ , which will be also crucial in this paper ( it is the topology considered by dorroh , neuberger in @xcite ) . in this respect",

    ", the adjoint bi - continuous semigroup construction mentioned above will be applied to study bi - continuous semigroups on the space @xmath7 of bounded baire measures .",
    "we further show that bi - continuous semigroups in some cases may be put in the theory of equicontinuous semigroups on locally convex spaces , but we also give an example , a rather pathological one , showing that this is not always possible ( section [ s : cnt ] ) .",
    "our result on the automatic equicontinuity of semigroups ( theorem [ thm : important ] ) has been obtained independently by m.  kunze even in a more general situation , see @xcite .",

    "if    a.   the orbit @xmath16 is @xmath12-continuous for all @xmath17 ( @xmath12-strongly continuous ) , b.   @xmath18 is a norm - bounded function , say , on @xmath19 $ ] , in which case it is exponentially bounded on @xmath20 .",
    "c.   @xmath0 is locally - bi - equicontinuous , which means that for a norm - bounded @xmath12-null sequence @xmath21 the convergence @xmath22 holds in the topology @xmath12 and uniformly in compact intervals .",
    "the main feature of this definition is that it mixes _ properties with respect to two topologies _ : the norm - topology of banach spaces ( thus it allows for norm - estimates ) and a weaker notion of convergence . as in ( iii ) above , for functions @xmath23 we use the term `` _ _ locally ... _ _ '' , if the property `` ...
