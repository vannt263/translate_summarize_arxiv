    "although bileptons @xcite can be considered as `` exotic '' particles relative to their standard model ( sm ) cousins due to their unfamiliar quantum numbers , they are , in a sense , a conservative prediction . even though they are suggested only by special extensions of the sm ,",
    "their existence is , in our view , no more special than other proposals such as weak - scale extra dimensions or supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "indeed bileptons are a prediction employing only the model building rules for renormalizable gauge theories so successful in the standard model .",
    "the main motivation for expecting bileptons is that they explain three quark - lepton families .    generically speaking ,",
    "a bilepton is a boson which couple to two leptons , but not to sm quarks , and which carries two units of lepton number .",
    "they are present in several beyond - sm scenarios , such as left - right symmetric models , technicolor and theories of grand unification .",
    "the bileptons in which we are interested are doubly charged vector bosons which couple to sm leptons , and are predicted when the standard model is embedded in a larger gauge group .",
    "the so - called 331 models @xcite fall into this category and in this article we restrict ourselves to this case .",
    "however , as will be explained in section ii , we expect our results to hold in any model containing vector bileptons .",
    "in bilepton pair production , each of the bileptons will decay to two same - sign leptons .",
    "therefore , they provide an exceptionally clean signature of four isolated high transverse momentum leptons , not necessarily of the same flavor . in this article",
    "we explore some of the consequences of this fact at the lhc .",
    "we study the actual collider signatures for the process @xmath0 @xmath1",
    "@xmath2 which has no sm background and is for this reason a `` golden '' channel for finding bileptons . in this process",
    ", a bilepton pair is produced via @xmath3 or @xmath4 channel where one of them decays into electrons while the other decays into muons .",
    "the most useful current lower bound on vector bileptons require these particles to be heavier than 740 gev @xcite .",
    "this limit has been derived from experimental limits on fermion pair production at lep and lepton - flavor charged lepton decays .",
    "another useful lower bound is @xmath5 850 gev , a result which was established from muonium - antimuonium conversion @xcite . although more stringent , this limit depends on the assumption that the bilepton coupling is flavor - diagonal . in this article",
    "we nevertheless consider bilepton masses as low as 400 gev , following a similar line of reasoning as @xcite , where the authors argued a lower bound of 350 gev for doubly - charged vector bilepton masses , a limit that is compatible with other low energy bounds @xcite .",
    "we also allow a larger upper bound for bilepton masses in 331 models than the usual 1 tev considered by some authors .",
    "this article has been organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our motivations to perform the present study . in section",
    "iii we explain the numerical procedure for simulating the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 reaction as well as its validation . in section",
    "iv we show relevant experimental observables for the bilepton golden channel . in section",
    "v we present the discovery potential for bileptons , calculating mass exclusion limits as a function of the lhc integrated luminosities , including a digression on the prospects for the accelerator s 7 tev run and for the super lhc ( slhc ) . we conclude in section vi .",
    "many interesting channels have been studied in the literature concerning bileptons , but curiously , there has been no systematic study on the phenomenology of the bilepton golden channel at the lhc .",
    "the authors in @xcite did a fairly comprehensive study of bilepton phenomenology at hadron colliders .",
    "but in all cases they limited themselves to bilepton pair - production study , disregarding its decays . in the present study",
    "we go a step further in understanding the actual collider signatures , by considering measurable final states .",
    "the 331 models are based on the gauge symmetry @xmath6 , hence their name .",
    "their first versions appeared in 1992 @xcite .",
    "there are many interesting aspects of the 331 models worth noticing but the most intriguing one is the explanation of three quark - lepton families , which is the main motivation for expecting bileptons in nature .",
    "this is done via a nontrivial anomaly cancellation in the 331 model that takes place between families , which is achieved by requiring the number of families to be equal to the number of quark colors .",
    "the explanation of the number of generations is also arguably one of the main reasons that keep model builders interested in 331 models , since they are one of the few which elegantly address this problem .",
    "the 331 models are also the simplest extension of the sm containing bileptons",
    ". other interesting features of the 331 models include : a ) they treat the third generation differently than the first two , this lead to an explanation of the heavy top quark mass ; b ) they have an automatic peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite , hence they are also able to solve the strong cp problem .",
    "moreover , gauge symmetry @xmath6 is considered a subgroup of the popular @xmath7 @xcite grand unified theory ( gut ) , which can be itself derived from @xmath8 @xcite heterotic string theory .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that contrary to the sm , in 331 models lepton family number is not required to be conserved , only total lepton number .",
    "there is already experimental proof that lepton family number is not an exact symmetry via neutrino oscillations and one can regard this as circumstantial evidence for the non conservation of lepton family number in general . the combination of such intriguing aspects make bileptons desirable candidates to be found in nature .",
    "another important point to be discussed is the minimal version of the 331 models .",
    "there are different ways in which @xmath6 can be broken down back to the @xmath9 sm gauge symmetry .",
    "the minimal version corresponds to use minimal higgs structure to achieve this goal . in this version",
    "it is required that the new neutral vector boson @xmath10 mass term to be coupled to the bilepton mass , like :    @xmath11    regarding theoretical upper bounds in 331 models there is no consensus in the literature .",
    "it was reasoned in @xcite that in 331 models , bileptons can not be significantly heavier than 1 tev , because of an upper limit in the symmetry breaking scale which is placed by requiring the sine squared of the weinberg mixing angle ( @xmath12 ) to be smaller than 1/4 , which is the same line of argumentation used in @xcite to conclude that the @xmath10 mass can not be itself heavier than 3.1 tev .",
    "considering the mass relation between @xmath10 and the bilepton , it could be argued that at least the minimal version of the 331 model could be excluded , should bileptons not be detected at the lhc , since any vector bilepton mass heavier than @xmath13 840 gev would violate the @xmath10 mass upper limit via the mass relation between the two gauge bosons given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this conclusion was challenged in @xcite .",
    "the argument is as follows .",
    "the 331 model predicts that there is an energy scale @xmath14 where the model loses its perturbative character .",
    "should experimental data suggest a lower bound on the vector bilepton mass larger than @xmath14 , the model would be ruled out .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is calculated through the condition @xmath15 , but from this requirement alone it is not possible to know the real value of @xmath14",
    ". then the upper limit on the vector bilepton mass could be , for instance , 3.5 tev , as has been discussed by @xcite . by the same token",
    "the 3.1 tev upper limit in the @xmath10 mass is automatically challenged .",
    "therefore we do not believe it is possible to unambiguously discard _ any _ 331 model at the lhc ( although they could be _ discovered _ at it ) , since we consider the bilepton mass upper bound to reasonably lie beyond the accelerator s reach .",
    "for the lower bounds on vector bileptons we consider at least two mass points that violate the general 740 gev limit imposed by lep data . as explained by the authors in @xcite , all the constraints on the 331 parameters coming from experiments involving leptonic interaction should be examined with caution . in the 331 model the leptons mix by a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa - like mixing matrix whose elements",
    "have not yet been measured , so usually these experiments ( and derived limits ) apply only when the leptonic mixing matrix is diagonal . also , in models with an extended higgs sector some not unrealistic situations could exist in which the scalar bosons contribution to muonium to antimuonium conversion is not negligible .",
    "this puts also the possibility of strengthening bilepton experimental limits still at the lhc s 7 tev run in a new perspective , a possibility that we also discuss in this article .      in recent years",
    ", a considerable fraction of both the experimental and theoretical communities has dedicated itself to supersymmetry .",
    "it is doubtlessly the mainstream subject in particle physics .",
    "the 331 models are not _ necessarily _ supersymmetric . but any renormalizable gauge theory can be extended to a globally supersymmetric model . the 331 models , being anomaly free , are renormalizable and fall of course in this category .",
    "some authors have explored this possibility @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as it was argued also in @xcite , in this model , the `` hierarchy problem '' is less severe than in the sm and its extensions since no arbitrary mass scale can be introduced .",
    "the masses of fundamental scalars are sensitive to the mass of the heaviest particles which couple directly or indirectly with them .",
    "since in the 331 model the heaviest mass scale is of the order of a few tevs there is not a `` hierarchy problem '' at all .",
    "this feature remains valid when supersymmetry is introduced .",
    "thus , the breaking of the supersymmetry is also naturally at the tev scale in the 331 model .",
    "ideally one would like to study bileptons in hadron colliders as model independent as possible . for vector bileptons",
    "this is not possible as the non - inclusion of the @xmath10 boson makes bilepton pair production to violate unitarity , in complete analogy to what happens with @xmath16 using only photon exchange .",
    "this is another motivation to use the 331 model , although we do not restrain ourselves to the minimal version , allowing @xmath17 and @xmath18 to vary independently of one another .",
    "even though model - dependent , our cross - sections should approximately be in the same order of magnitude with any other model containing bileptons , since at hadron colliders these particles have to be produced by the same drell - yan pair production process , regardless of the model .",
    "exotic heavy quark exchange can influence this scenario , a possibility we do explore and which make our conclusions even more general .",
    "to simulate the bilepton golden channel at the lhc we have implemented the 331 model in the comphep generator @xcite .",
    "we followed reference @xcite to implement the bilepton trilinear gauge interactions and @xcite for the @xmath10 couplings with fermions .",
    "for the bilepton interaction with leptons we have used the lagrangian expression given in @xcite , generating the respective couplings using the lanhep package @xcite .",
    "we also take into account bilepton interactions with exotic quarks in the 331 model . for this , we considered the following interactions with the exotic quark sector :    @xmath19 + \\mbox{h .",
    "c. } , \\label{ll}\\ ] ]    where q ( @xmath20,@xmath21,@xmath22 ) is an exotic heavy quark in the 331 model , q is a sm quark and @xmath23 as in the sm .",
    "we considered the respective interaction pairs for ( @xmath24 ) to be ( @xmath20,@xmath25 ) , ( @xmath21,@xmath26 ) and ( @xmath22,@xmath27 ) , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are sm quarks .",
    "our purpose in including such interactions was , besides studying the influence of the heavy quark sector , to guarantee that all relevant quark subprocesses @xmath28 respect unitarity .",
    "since the 331 model itself does not determine the elements of the mixing matrix ( which determines how bileptons interact with exotic quarks ) , this is a reasonable criteria .",
    "this was needed for @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 which violate unitarity otherwise . in figure 1",
    ", one can see the @xmath29 reaction cross - section as a function of the center of mass energy .",
    "note that up to energies beyond the lhc designed center - of - mass - energy of 14 tev , the cross - section dependence with energy behaves as expected .",
    "we tested this fact for all quarks involved in the proton parton distribution function ( pdf ) , cteq6l1 @xcite that was used for the complete @xmath0 @xmath32 @xmath2 reaction simulation .",
    "concerning particle parameters , we considered heavy quark masses to be equal to 400 gev , 600 gev and 800 gev ( lower bounds on exotic supersymmetric particles impose a lower bound on 331 exotic quark masses to be @xmath13 250 gev @xcite ) and used 1 tev for the @xmath10 mass , since 331 @xmath33 masses below 920 gev were excluded using results from the cdf collaboration @xcite . for the doubly charged bileptons @xmath34 we considered four mass points : 400 , 600 , 800 , gev and 1 tev . for each mass point",
    ", @xmath35 @xmath0 @xmath32 @xmath2 events were generated with comphep .",
    "the @xmath34 , @xmath10 and exotic quarks widths were calculated directly in comphep for each mass point.the @xmath10 width for @xmath36 = 400 gev is @xmath37 360 gev . for the other two exotics quark masses",
    ", @xmath38 drops to @xmath13 155 gev , since z decay into exotic quarks becomes kinematically forbidden .",
    "the variation of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath17 is of order of 1% between the highest and lowest bilepton mass considered .    to further cross - check our implementation we reproduced the results from reference @xcite figure 4 , for bilepton pair production at the lhc using @xmath18 = 1 tev .",
    "minor numerical differences in the cross - sections can easily be explained by the use of different pdf s .",
    "in what follows , all histograms were produced considering an integrated luminosity of @xmath39 and the nominal lhc energy of 14 tev , unless otherwise stated .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the total cross - section of the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 process as a function of the doubly - charged bilepton mass , for three different exotic quark masses . here",
    "one can see clear evidence on the problem of the influence of the heavy quark sector on bilepton production .",
    "note that for a bilepton of @xmath17 = 800 gev the effect on the cross - section on having _ heavier _ exotic quark masses of @xmath36 = 800 gev as compared to @xmath36 = 400 gev is to _ increase _ the cross - section of the the process by a factor of @xmath13 30 .",
    "we can also see that the @xmath40 = 600 and @xmath40 = 800 curves split at @xmath17 = 600 gev .",
    "this happens because when @xmath41 , bilepton decays like @xmath42 becomes kinematically allowed , which makes the value of @xmath43 ) decrease for a given bilepton mass .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the bilepton width as a function of bilepton mass for the same exotic quark masses as before .",
    "here we can see how the width increases when new decays are allowed .",
    "it is also clear from the plot that the bilepton resonance is very narrow .",
    "we admittedly used a very simple approach to the problem of how bileptons and heavy quarks actually mix .",
    "however , different ways on determining the values of the mixing matrix between bileptons and heavy quarks could , in principle , intensify such effects even more drastically . an open problem that would deserve a separate study of its own .      in order to investigate a more realistic scenario",
    ", we require the events that have been generated to pass some selection criteria according to the lhc detectors .",
    "first , the four leptons must be within the detectors geometrical acceptance , i.e. , @xmath44 @xcite . with this requirement",
    ", the fraction of selected events goes from 83% for @xmath17 = 400 gev to 93% for @xmath5 900 gev .",
    "additionally , we also require each lepton @xmath45 be greater than 20 gev .",
    "the loss of efficiency due this cut is negligible .",
    "finally , we assume a reconstruction efficiency of 60% .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] illustrates the electron pair pseudorapidity distribution of the events before and after the selection for @xmath17 = 600 gev where we can see the fraction of surviving events .",
    "the acceptance ( geometrical acceptance @xmath46 efficiency ) for this case is 53% , and this changes by @xmath47 3% depending on the bilepton mass .",
    "the pseudorapidity distribution for muons is similar .      in figures",
    "[ fig3b ] and [ fig4 ] it is respectively shown the transverse momentum distribution for both the final state selected electrons and muons pairs of the golden channel , where both the doubly - charged bilepton and the heavy quarks have a mass of 600 gev .",
    "typically most of the events are produced in a region between @xmath13 200 gev and 400 gev but the tail of the distribution has few events going up to 900 gev for the electron pairs .",
    "when doubly - charged vector bileptons are produced in pairs each bilepton can decay to a pair of same - sign leptons , not necessarily of the same flavor , where each lepton pair will have the same invariant mass distribution",
    ". this would be the most compelling evidence of a new resonance coming from a bilepton and very strong evidence of new physics .",
    "this is displayed in figures 7 and 8 for the final electron and muon pairs respectively , considering both the bilepton and exotic quarks masses to be equal 600 gev .",
    "the mean of the invariant mass for both the electrons and muon pairs in the final state unmistakably peaks at 600 gev , the bilepton mass .",
    "such a plot will of course demand several years of data taking such that enough statistics can be gathered , especially for higher bilepton masses , as we will address in the next section .",
    "in order to determine the lhc potential to find bileptons , we calculate the minimal lhc integrated luminosity needed for a five - sigma bilepton discovery . for each bilepton mass ,",
    "the detector acceptance as stated in section iv.b is considered and the @xmath48 significance is obtained by requiring 5 events with two electrons and two muons in the final state to be produced .",
    "the minimal integrated luminosity @xmath49 is given by    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the detector acceptance and @xmath52 is the cross seciton .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows the calculated values of @xmath49 as a function of bilepton mass . from the plot ,",
    "we conclude that a integrated luminosity of order of 10 @xmath53 is enough for discovering a bilepton of 400 gev mass , which means that such signal can be observed at the very early days of lhc running with 14 tev , even in a regime of low luminosity . depending on the exotic quark mass , luminosities of order 10 @xmath54 to 100 @xmath54",
    "are needed to discover bileptons if @xmath55 = 800 gev .",
    "these scenarios can be achieved after 1 year of lhc operation in low and high luminosity regimes , respectively .",
    "finally , for @xmath55 = 1 tev , around 10 years of lhc operation at high luminosity would be needed for the resonance observation .",
    "this is in contrast with what would happen at the ilc where mller and bhabha scattering receive both huge corrections from virtual vector bileptons @xcite , so that the bilepton mass reach can be as high as @xmath13 11 tev , provided polarized beams are used .",
    "figure [ fig15 ] shows the integrated luminosity required for excluding bileptons at 95% cl as function of the bilepton mass . for this estimation",
    ", we have used the d0 limit calculator @xcite to set upper limits on the cross sections that are consistent with the observation of zero events in data , assuming no background .",
    "the bayesian technique is used to set this limits . in this approach , given a posterior probability density function for the signal cross - section , the upper limit on the signal cross section @xmath56 , specified at some confidence level @xmath57 , is given by    @xmath58    where @xmath59 = 0.95 , @xmath60 is the posterior probability density function , @xmath61 is the number of events observed and @xmath62 represents prior information available .",
    "the acceptances values used in this calculation are the same as before .",
    "we have assumed an uncertainty of 5% on the acceptance and 10% on the integrated luminosity .",
    "it also is assumed that the errors on the acceptance and luminosity are uncorrelated .",
    "the obtained limits on the cross section are then translated to limits on the bilepton mass . comparing figure [ fig15 ] with the discovery plot",
    ", we can see that around 60% of the discovery integrated luminosity is needed for excluding bileptons of a given mass .",
    "if a significant signal is observed , the next natural step is to determine the properties of the new particle . in order to check",
    "how well the bilepton mass can be reconstructed with the amount of data needed for discovering , we perform a unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 distributions for @xmath55 = 600 gev and @xmath55 = 800 gev mc samples , with a fixed exotic quark mass of 600 gev .",
    "the probability density function used in the fits is a breit - wigner and two parameters are fitted : the position of the invariant mass peak @xmath65 and the resonance width @xmath66 . for each bilepton mass , fits are performed to 1000 mc experiments ( i.e , 1000 @xmath63 and @xmath64 distributions ) and the mean values of the fitted parameters are reported .",
    "the number of events in each mc experiment is fixed to 5 .",
    "table i shows the mean , @xmath67 , of the fitted mass values and the standard deviation of the @xmath65 distribution . for both bilepton masses ,",
    "we see that there is a very good agreement between fitted and true masses in both channels . as expected , the spread of the distribution is larger for @xmath55 = 800 gev .",
    "the bilepton width can also be obtained from the fit at generator level , but it will be dominated by the detector resolution in a more realistic scenario , since bileptons are very narrow resonances .    .",
    "mean and standard deviation of fitted mass peak for dielectron and dimuon invariant mass distributions .",

    "we have investigated the lhc potential for discovering or setting limits on doubly - charged vector bileptons , in different scenarios considering important experimental aspects in the simulation like detector geometrical acceptance , luminosity uncertainty and lepton efficiency . by analysing the observable final state @xmath68 , we have found that bilepton signatures can already be observed at very early stages of lhc running with 14 tev , if the bilepton mass is not much greater than 400 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bilepton mass lies in the tev scale , at least 10 years of the machine operation will be needed for discovering it , if @xmath69 600 gev .",
    "the observation of such signal , in combination with @xmath70 searches in dilepton channel , would provide a very powerful way of discriminating between 331 models and other bsm scenarios which also predict heavy neutral gauge bosons .",
