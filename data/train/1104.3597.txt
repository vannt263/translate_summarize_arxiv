    "ly@xmath0  nebulae , or `` blobs , '' are extended sources at @xmath9 @xmath6 26 with typical ly@xmath0  sizes of @xmath105  ( @xmath1050kpc ) and line luminosities of @xmath11 ergs@xmath4 . their number density and its large variance suggests that blobs lie in massive ( @xmath12 @xmath6 @xmath13@xmath14 ) dark matter halos , which will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today @xcite .",
    "galaxies embedded within blobs are likely to become brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "therefore , blobs are important sites for studying the early interaction of galaxies with the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) .    this interaction is probably tied on some scale to the source of the blobs extended ly@xmath0  emission , but the mechanism is poorly understood .",
    "for example , the blob may represent emission from galactic - scale outflows generated by star formation , intense radiative feedback from agns , or even cooling radiation from accreting gas .",
    "there are generally two ways to unravel the nature of the blobs .",
    "the first approach is to study what powers the ly@xmath0  emitting gas , counting all ionizing sources within or around the extended ly@xmath0  emission and comparing that energy budget with the observed ly@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "sometimes , one can identify possible energy sources , e.g. , powerful agns detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "some potential sources may even lie outside a blob @xcite .",
    "if no such source is found , the remaining ly@xmath0  luminosity may be attributable to cooling radiation .",
    "an alternative path is to observe spectroscopically the kinematics of the extended ly@xmath0-emitting gas .",
    "even addressing whether the gas is falling into an embedded galaxy or outflowing into the igm would be a significant step forward , providing evidence for either gas accretion by forming galaxies or for agn / starburst - driven galactic winds , respectively .",
    "combining the two approaches by considering the blob s energetics and kinematics simultaneously is ideal , a test of whether the bulk motions of the gas are in fact coupled to the source of its illumination .",
    "for example , gas infall is possible even in the presence of an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "cases in which blob gas is both outflowing on small scales due to galactic processes and infalling on larger scales from the extended igm are not unlikely .",
    "unfortunately , the kinematic approach has been stymied by the limitations of the ly@xmath0  line , which , although bright compared with other lines , is hard to interpret .",
    "the ambiguity arises because ly@xmath0  is a resonant line and typically optically thick in the surrounding intergalactic medium . as a result",
    ", studies even of the same blob s kinematics can disagree .",
    "on one hand , @xcite argue that ifu spectra from a certain blob are consistent with a simple model where the ly@xmath0  emission is absorbed by a foreground slab of neutral gas swept out by a galactic scale outflow . on the other",
    ", @xcite claim that the same data can be explained by the infall of the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "worse , @xcite comment that the same ly@xmath0  profiles are most consistent with static surrounding gas .    to distinguish among such possibilities",
    "requires a comparison of the ly@xmath0  line center with the center of an optically - thin line like h@xmath0@xmath16563 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath0 is a better measure of the blob s systemic velocity , i.e. , of the precise redshift , because it is not seriously altered by radiative transfer effects and is more concentrated about the galaxies in the blob s core . despite the complexity of various blob models ,",
    "infall models predict that the peak of the optically thick ly@xmath0  emission line must be blueshifted with respect to h@xmath0 , whereas outflows will redshift the ly@xmath0line @xcite .",
    "this diagnostic has been applied both to local starburst galaxies @xcite and to lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath9 = 1.52.5 @xcite and has provided evidence for outflows driven by strong stellar winds .",
    "an analysis in a similar spirit , but using the 21 cm absorption line to mark the systemic redshift of a high-@xmath9 radio galaxy , finds that the ly@xmath0line is blueshifted and thus that extended gas is inflowing to the agn @xcite .",
    "previous spectroscopic observations of ly@xmath0  blobs ( e.g. , at @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) include only ly@xmath0 , precluding a direct comparison with a cleaner line s center and muddling the interpretation of the kinematics .    to overcome this challenge , @xcite conduct blind surveys for ly@xmath0  blobs at @xmath2 , a redshift at which important rest - frame optical diagnostic lines ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath13727 , [ ] @xmath15007 , h@xmath16@xmath14868 , h@xmath0@xmath16563 ) fall in nir windows and avoid bright oh sky lines ( or atmospheric absorption ) .",
    "in this paper , we present optical and nir spectroscopy of the two brightest blobs , cdfs - lab01 and cdfs - lab02 , of the 25 in the @xcite sample . for each",
    ", we compare the ly@xmath0line profile with the center of the h@xmath0 line and use existing radiative transfer models @xcite to test whether the detected gas is infalling or outflowing .",
    "in addition to the blob s systemic velocity , nir spectroscopy can constrain ( 1 ) the velocity dispersion and any ordered motion like disk rotation of the brightest embedded galaxies , ( 2 ) the presence of agns with rest - frame optical nebular line diagnostics ( e.g. , [ ] /h@xmath0 ) , ( 3 ) the gas - phase metallicity , and ( 4 ) the star formation rate ( sfr ) directly from the h@xmath0 flux , allowing a comparison with that derived from the rest - frame uv . before now , none of these measurements has been available for ly@xmath0  blobs . in this paper , we focus on the kinematics of the gas in the blob and in the embedded galaxies , deferring discussions of the agn line diagnostics , gas - phase metallicity , and sfrs to a future paper ( y.  yang et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .    in  [ sec : observation ] , we review how we selected blobs from our narrowband imaging surveys @xcite and then describe the optical / nir spectroscopy of the first two blobs . in  [ sec : result ] , we present the first results from the spectroscopic campaign .",
    "we confirm spectroscopically the blob redshift and discover multiple h@xmath0 sources within each blob (  [ sec : confirmation ] ) .",

    "we estimate the velocity dispersions of three of the embedded galaxies in  [ sec : dynamical_mass ] . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we compare the ly@xmath0  profiles and ly@xmath0@xmath17h@xmath0 offsets with existing radiative transfer models .",
    "we also discuss our results in the context of the clumpy circum - galactic gas model proposed by @xcite . ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters : @xmath18 = 70@xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we observe the two brightest ly@xmath0  blobs from the @xcite sample , which consists of 25 blobs discovered in four different survey fields .",
    "these two blobs lie in the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) and were found via deep imaging with the ctio-4 m mosaic  ii camera and a custom narrowband filter ( _ nb_403 ) .",
    "this filter has a central wavelength of @xmath22 , designed for selecting ly@xmath0-emitting sources at @xmath23 , and a band - width of @xmath24 , providing a line of sight ( hereafter los ) depth of @xmath25 that corresponds to 46.8 comoving mpc .",
    "the blob selection criteria are : ew@xmath26 @xmath27 100  and isophotal area @xmath28 @xmath27 10  above the surface brightness threshold of 5.5 @xmath29 10@xmath30 ergs@xmath4@xmath31arcsec@xmath32 .",
    "we show the images of the two blobs ( cdfs - lab01 and cdfs - lab02 ) in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for details of the sample selection .",
    "we obtained high resolution optical spectra of the two ly@xmath0  blobs using the magellan echellette spectrograph ( mage ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope .",
    "mage provides a spectral resolution of @xmath33 @xmath6 4100 for a 1  slit over a wide wavelength range of 3000 10000 . while the slit length is small ( 10 ) compared to typical longslits , the excellent blue sensitivity around 4000  is ideal for obtaining the ly@xmath0  line profile .",
    "observations were carried out on ut 2008 july 26 and october 1 , and 2009 february 17 .",
    "for lab01 , we first acquired a low resolution spectrum in 2008 july 26 to spectroscopically confirm the redshift prior to the nir spectroscopic run . later , we obtained the @xmath34 spectrum with a slit orientation of p.a.=42  as shown in figure [ fig : image ] ( ly@xmath0  panel ) . for lab02 , we used a 2  slit and a p.a.=0  to obtain a @xmath33 @xmath6 2000 spectrum .",
    "the sky condition was clear , and the seeing ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 .",
    "the individual exposure times varied from 20 to 40min , depending on the variability of the seeing .",
    "total exposure times were 2.5 and 2.0 hrs for lab01 and lab02 , respectively . for accurate wavelength calibration , we took thar lamp frames right before and after the science exposures and at the same telescope pointing to eliminate systematic errors introduced by instrument flexure .",
    "we reduce the mage data using the daniel kelson s carnegie - python package @xcite .",
    "the frames are overscan - corrected , bias - subtracted , and flat - fielded with xenon - flash and quartz ( incandescent ) lamps . using night sky lines and thar lamp spectra",
    ", we estimate the uncertainties in the wavelength solution to be @xmath60.03(0.1 pixel ) .",
    "the sky background is then subtracted in 2d using the method described in @xcite , and the frames are corrected for spatial distortions .",
    "we combine the rectified 2d spectra and extract the 1d spectra using idl routines .",
    "we also re - reduce the data with the mage spectral extractor package ( mase ; * ? ? ? * ) and confirm that the results are consistent .",
    "the spectra are flux - calibrated with 23 standard stars each night . due to the limited spatial coverage of the slit and the relatively short exposure times ,",
    "our spectra are dominated by the brightest spots within the blobs , which coincide with the galaxies detected in the _ hst _ rest - frame uv images .",
    "future ifu observations should be helpful in constraining how the ly@xmath0  profiles vary over the blobs .",
    "we carried out nir integral field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy of the two ly@xmath0blobs using sinfoni @xcite on the vlt ut4 telescope in visitor mode between ut 2009 january 30 and february 4 . to measure the redshifted h@xmath0 ( @xmath35 @xmath6 2.175 ) line",
    ", we used the _",
    "k_-band grating , which covers 1.95   2.45  with a spectral resolution of @xmath33 @xmath36 4000 ( @xmath5 @xmath36 75kms@xmath4 ) and dispersion of 2.5pixel@xmath4 . because the blobs are spatially extended over 510  and include multiple sources , we employed the seeing - limited mode ( i.e. , no adaptive optics ) , which provided the largest fov ( 8@xmath298 ) and a plate scale of 025pixel@xmath4 for the spatial resolution elements ( spaxels ) . in each observing block , we observed reference stars , which we used to blind offset to the blobs as well as to monitor the telescope pointing accuracy and the seeing variations .",
    "the _ k_-band seeing ranged from 03 to 12 , and the sky condition was clear . to maximize the on - source integration time , we adopted an `` on - source dithering '' strategy in which the science targets were always kept within the fov but at different detector positions .",
    "for lab01 , we used a three - point dithering scheme that moves among the pointings by @xmath64  to south or west , providing a usable fov of two 4@xmath294  squares ( see the sinfoni panel in figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "for lab02 , we employed a two - point dither pattern in the north - south direction , resulting in a 8@xmath294  effective fov ( dot - dashed line in figure [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the total integration times for lab01 and lab02 are 6 hrs and 0.5 hrs , respectively , which consist of 5 or 10 min individual exposures depending on the sky condition . for the telluric correction and flux calibration ,",
    "we observed four b or g stars every night before or after the science targets with wide range of airmass .",
    "we reduce the sinfoni data using the eso pipeline .",
    "dark current and sky background are removed from each science frame by subtracting the pseudo - sky frame , which is constructed from the average of the two science frames bracketing each science frame .",
    "then , we flat - field the data and correct for bad pixels . because we will compare the velocity centers of the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 lines ,",
    "accurate wavelength calibration is critical .",
    "we compare the wavelength solution obtained from the oh sky lines in the science frames to that from the daytime arc lamps .",
    "the arc lamp wavelength calibration error arising from instrument flexure can be as large as 1.5 , depending on the airmass ( which ranges up to @xmath62.0 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopt the oh sky line wavelength calibration , whose error is typically @xmath6 0.1(0.04 pixel ) for each science frame . using this wavelength solution",
    ", we constructed 3d data cubes from the 2d spectra after correcting spatial distortion . because it is not possible to identify / centroid the sources in individual exposures , we align them according to the dither offsets within each observing block ( ob ) .",
    "the spatial offsets between obs are calculated from the psf calibration frames and are typically small ( @xmath6 01 ) .",
    "when combining the data cubes , we adopt an iterative @xmath37-clipping algorithm to reject possible outliers and produce the `` sigma cubes '' that represent the standard deviation of the adopted pixels . because no stellar continuum is detected , we subtract the median sky values from each wavelength plane to avoid the strong variation of global sky background . finally , we flux - calibrate the cubes using the broad - band magnitudes of standard stars .",
    "atmospheric absorption is minimal at h@xmath0 due to our choice of survey redshift , so we do not apply a telluric correction .",
    "we spectroscopically confirm the redshifts ( @xmath9 @xmath36 2.31  2.32 ) of the two ly@xmath0  blobs using both the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] shows the two ly@xmath0  blobs at various wavelengths : _ u _ , continuum - subtracted ly@xmath0  line , _ b _ , _ k _ , _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 , and _ hst _",

    ", we show only data taken in the best seeing ( @xmath6 03 ) to be comparable with the _ hst _ resolution .",
    "interestingly , in the _ hst _ rest - frame _ uv _ images , both ly@xmath0blobs include multiple galaxies and/or fragments , some of which appear to be interacting ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "thus , while some clumps / fragments could be part of a one large galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "lab02 has several interstellar absorption lines that we use in  [ sec : absorption ] to help constrain the kinematics of gas around the embedded galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the optically thick and spatially extended ly@xmath0  emission , we can use the optically thin , more spatially concentrated h@xmath0 emission to make an independent determination of the blob redshift from the galaxies embedded in the centers of the blobs .",

    ", we focus on the brighter sw component of the blob . the excellent seeing of our sinfoni observation ( @xmath6 0.3 ) allows us to spatially resolve two embedded galaxies ( a and b ) in the sw part of the blob ( hereafter lab01a and lab01b ; fig .  [ fig : image])5kpc and the velocity offset is @xmath6440kms@xmath4 . ] .",
    "these two galaxies are also kinematically separated as shown in the sinfoni h@xmath0 channel map ( figure [ fig : channel ] ) , a series of h@xmath0 intensity maps constructed by stepping through the 3d sinfoni data cubes in increments of 70kms@xmath4 .",
    "galaxy b shows an apparent velocity shear of @xmath6 250 kms@xmath4 , suggesting disk rotation , while galaxy a has no obvious velocity structure . in their spatially integrated h@xmath0 spectra",

    "this relative velocity is a poor estimate of the velocity dispersion @xmath37 of the halo in which these galaxies are embedded .",

    "it is also possible that galaxy d is blended with the much brighter galaxy a in the ifu data .",
    "we are not able to reliably extract h@xmath0 profiles from galaxies ( b+c ) and d because of the shallow exposure ( 30 min ) and insufficient spatial resolution .",

    "in this section , we compare the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 lines to constrain the gas kinematics within the blobs .",
    "more specifically , we measure the velocity shift of the ly@xmath0  line relative to the h@xmath0 line center to distinguish between any infall and outflow of the igm relative to the blob s systemic velocity . once we measure this first - order kinematic diagnostic ( i.e. , any blueshift or redshift of the ly@xmath0  line ) , we discuss the detailed ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 profiles in  [ sec : discussion ] , comparing them with radiative transfer calculations to determine the velocity of the dominant bulk motion .    to illustrate what we expect from this experiment , we first consider the simplest geometric case : a galaxy surrounded by a spherically symmetric gas cloud that is static , collapsing , or expanding @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the h@xmath0 line arises from the embedded galaxy , as we do not detect extended h@xmath0 emission , and that the ly@xmath0  line originates either in the same region of the galaxy before eventually escaping the surrounding cloud or in the cloud itself .",
    "thus this blob will be observed as a point source in h@xmath0 , but as an extended source in ly@xmath0 .",
    "note that the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 spectroscopy is along the los toward the central galaxy .",
    "while h@xmath0 from the galaxy can escape the surrounding gas without suffering absorption , ly@xmath0photons from the galaxy and from gas along the los will be resonantly scattered many times until their frequencies are right for escaping the cloud , a condition dependent on the bulk motions of gas along the los .",
    "because the cloud is optically thick to the ly@xmath0  line , ly@xmath0  photons on the doppler wings should escape the cloud through random scatterings in the frequency domain .",
    "if the surrounding gas is static , the ly@xmath0line will have a double - peaked profile , while the optically thin h@xmath0 photons will escape without any radiative transfer effects .",
    "if the cloud is collapsing , ly@xmath0  photons within the cloud on the red side of double - peaked profile will see higher optical depth due to the los infalling gas , and the red peak will be depressed",
    ". if the gas is outflowing , the blue side of the profile will be more diminished .",
    "therefore , if there is gas infall , the ly@xmath0  profile will be asymmetric and blueshifted against the h@xmath0 line due to radiative transfer in the optically thick medium , but the corresponding h@xmath0 line profile should be symmetric . for outflowing gas , the ly@xmath0  will be redshifted against the symmetric h@xmath0 line .",
    "the amount of shift depends on various parameters such as infall / outflow velocity and optical depth .",
    "note that one can not determine whether the ly@xmath0  line is redshifted or blueshifted against the background velocity field unless there is a optically thin reference line , i.e. , h@xmath0 .",
    "the actual geometry of the system is likely to be more complicated (  [ sec : discussion ] ) . yet",
    "the blue- or redshift of the ly@xmath0photons relative to the systemic velocity will occur as they make their way out of the system , as long as they encounter optically - thick gas that is infalling or outflowing along the los @xcite .",
    "in other words , we are studying the bulk motion of gas along the pencil beam toward the embedded galaxies when we compare the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 profiles extracted from this sight - line . in principle , it is even possible to compare the velocity offsets between extended ly@xmath0  and _ extended _ h@xmath0 lines in two dimensions ( i.e. , h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0  screens ) with much deeper h@xmath0 spectroscopy and optical ifu data .    in summary ,",
    "the basic assumptions for our simple test using the velocity offset between the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 lines are :    1 .   ly@xmath0  should go through an optically thick column of gas ( either infalling or outflowing ) to escape .",
    "2 .   h@xmath0 represents the systemic velocity of the entire system , and gas is moving ( infalling or outflowing ) relative to this center .    with these assumptions in mind",

    "note that all the optical and nir wavelengths are converted to vacuum wavelengths and corrected to the heliocentric frame . in both blobs , the ly@xmath0  line is broader than the h@xmath0 line and has a more complicated structure ( i.e. , an asymmetric profile or multiple peaks ) , implying that the ly@xmath0  lines do experience resonant scattering .",

    "one possible way to hide a blueshift in this simple infall model would be if the infalling gas is made optically thin by an ionizing source or has low enough column density so that the ly@xmath0  photons do not suffer resonant scattering ( see fig .  11 in d06 or fig .",

    "we will further discuss this caveat in  [ sec : misalignment ] .      in  [ sec :",
    "shift ] , we found that the offset of the ly@xmath0  line relative to h@xmath0 was either consistent with zero ( lab01 ) or redshifted ( lab02 ) .",
    "the existence of a modest outflow in lab02 was further supported by the low - ionization absorption line shifts discussed in section [ sec : absorption ] .",
    "the absence of a redshifted @xmath7  in lab01 does not necessarily exclude an outflow because of its extended ly@xmath0  profile toward the red .",
    "here we compare the ly@xmath0  profiles of our blobs with the rt outflow models of @xcite to interpret the velocity offset @xmath7  in a more sophisticated manner .    in these radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 velocity offset is modulated entirely by the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0  photons through a continuous medium within the shell .",
    "another possibility , which we discuss in section [ sec : clumpycgm ] , is that the gas around the galaxy is clumpy and that the bulk motions of these clumps primarily modulate the emerging ly@xmath0  profile @xcite . in the following section , we constrain the outflow velocity or `` wind velocity '' from the embedded galaxies using the rt calculations .",
    "it is then possible to ask whether such an outflow is energetic enough ( i.e. , the expansion velocity @xmath75  is large ) to expel / launch gas out to larger radii , thus creating the extended ly@xmath0  emission observed as a blob with a typical size of @xmath10 50kpc .      to connect @xmath7  with an outflow velocity",
    ", we compare each blob s ly@xmath0profile with a model with an expanding shell geometry . such a geometry would arise in the simple `` superwind '' or `` hyperwind '' model for ly@xmath0blobs proposed by and @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "supernova explosions or stellar winds following an intense starburst in galaxies develop into a so - called superbubble .",
    "if the kinetic energy deposited into the surrounding gas overcomes the gravitational potential energy of the galaxy , the gas clouds are blown out into intergalactic space as a superwind ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "the gas blown out from the galaxies forms a shell , and the ly@xmath0photons are scattered from this expanding shell ( with @xmath75 ) , escaping preferentially by the scattering from the backside .",
    "in contrast , the h@xmath0 lines provide the systemic velocity of the star forming region .",
    "v06 and v08 demonstrate that the radiative transfer of ly@xmath0  in this simple shell geometry is able to explain a wide range of observed ly@xmath0profiles .",
    "v08 classified ly@xmath0  profiles into three categories : ( 1 ) single - peaked asymmetric profile with an extended red wing , ( 2 ) profile with double peaks separated by sharp absorption at @xmath52kms@xmath4 , and ( 3 ) asymmetric profile with bluer bump(s ) . thanks to the h@xmath0 line , which provides the velocity center , we can determine that lab01 and lab02 correspond to ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) without ambiguity .",
    "we start with lab01 , which has an asymmetric ly@xmath0  profile without any obvious blue peaks , but with an extended red wing and/or multiple red peaks ( i.e. , category 1 above ) .",
    "v06 show that a blue peak ( @xmath49 @xmath76 0kms@xmath4 ) is strongly suppressed with increasing ( @xmath77 ) ratio , i.e. , when the bulk outflow motion becomes more important than the thermal and turbulent motion of the shell gas .",
    "the resonant scattering in the expanding shell produces mainly two red peaks depending on the paths of the emergent photons : one peak near the line center ( @xmath49 @xmath6 0kms@xmath4 ) and another at @xmath78 , corresponding to photons that experience zero or one back - scattering from the receding shell , respectively .",
    "here , the back - scattering of a photon means that it travels across the empty interior before re - entering the shell at a different location .",
    "thus the location of the second red peak is a useful diagnostic for the outflow velocity .",
    "because of the degeneracy between many model parameters ( @xmath75 , @xmath71 , @xmath70 , @xmath79 ) , constraining the outflow velocity well requires fitting the spectra directly to the rt calculations .",
    "we do not have the means to do that here , so we estimate @xmath75  for lab01 from how much its red ly@xmath0  peaks are redshifted against its h@xmath0 line center .",
    "if @xmath70  is sufficiently large ( @xmath70@xmath10 @xmath80cm@xmath4 ) , the second red peak becomes larger and merges with the first red peak , so that the stronger red peak measures 2@xmath75  ( see fig .  1 of v08 ) .",
    "if this case applies here , our @xmath7@xmath6 0kms@xmath4  implies @xmath75@xmath6 0kms@xmath4 , i.e. , that the shell is static .    on the other hand , decreasing @xmath70 , increasing dust extinction ( @xmath82 ) , and decreasing @xmath77 tends to strengthen the first red peak , so that the brighter peak is located at 0 @xmath83 @xmath75  and does not carry any @xmath75  information . in this case",
    ", the location of the weaker second peak provides an estimate of @xmath75 . as discussed in  [ sec : confirmation ] , the lab01 profile s extended red wing could be interpreted as multiple components ( see figure [ fig : line_comparison ] ) . if we adopt the small bump at @xmath49 @xmath6 300kms@xmath4  as the second peak , the expansion velocity of the shell is @xmath75  @xmath6 150kms@xmath4 . considering both cases ,",
    "the outflow velocity in lab01 could range from 0kms@xmath4  to @xmath6150kms@xmath4 .",
    "the ly@xmath0  profile of lab02 is most consistent with the double - peaked profile ( i.e , category 2 above ) of @xcite , who claim that such profiles arise when the shell is almost static ( @xmath75  @xmath6 0kms@xmath4 ) . due to the h@xmath0 measurement",
    ", there is no ambiguity about the location of the velocity center .",
    "even if we consider only the red side of the profile and classify it as a single asymmetric profile like lab01 , we would obtain an outflow velocity only as high as @xmath6 @xmath7/2 = 115kms@xmath4 .",
    "the blueshifted centroids of the low - ionization absorption lines in lab02 are also consistent with this inferred outflow velocity .    therefore , if the expanding shell geometry is applicable to our two ly@xmath0  blobs , we conclude that any outflows from the embedded galaxies are not strong ( @xmath75  @xmath55 150kms@xmath4 ) compared to the values required by the extreme `` superwind '' or `` hyperwind '' scenarios to explain the large size ( @xmath84kpc ) and broad ly@xmath0  linewidth ( fwhm @xmath6 1000kms@xmath4 ) of blobs .",
    "the simple shell geometry assumed here has some physical motivation and has been explored by extensive rt calculations ( e.g. , v06 and v08 ) .",
    "however , this model implies that the outflows are intermittent with a small duty cycle , contrary to the observation that outflows are seen in most star forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we note that if there is a continuous stream of outflowing material , it might lead to a different interpretation of kinematic signatures discussed above .",
    "one other claim of an outflow in a blob was reported by @xcite using ifu observations of the ly@xmath0  line in steidel s blob 2 .",
    "using an expanding shell model , they found that the central wavelength , i.e. , velocity , of absorption systems on top of the underlying broad ly@xmath0  profiles is coherent across the whole blob with a blueshift of @xmath6250 kms@xmath4 . because the systemic velocity of the blob gas is unknown in their case ,",
    "there are other possible interpretations of their data , even including an inflow @xcite . @xcite and @xcite found that steidel s blob 1 has an extremely complicated velocity structure , including velocity shears around the embedded galaxies that can be interpreted as either outflow or rotation .",
    "it is interesting that all investigations of blob kinematics to date ( in our cdfs - lab01 and cdfs - lab02 , steidel s blobs 1 and 2 ) suggest relatively small outflow velocities .",
    "therefore , the large wind speeds required by super / hyper - wind models to explain the extended ly@xmath0emission are excluded .",
    "one way to reconcile the small outflows with the `` superwind '' model is to assume that the outflow was once more energetic and that the expanding shell has been broken up or slowed by contact with the surrounding igm @xcite . clearly , constraining the kinematics of more ly@xmath0  blobs is needed to address whether these small outflows are representative .",
    "we conclude that the gas motion around the galaxies embedded in these ly@xmath0  blobs is not consistent with models like the simple superwind picture that assume a spherical shell geometry and a shell velocity exceeding @xmath6500 kms@xmath4 . yet",
    "galactic scale outflows from star - forming galaxies at @xmath74 appear to be common .",
    "the outflow properties have been extensively studied by comparing the ly@xmath0  velocity center with those of optically - thin nebular lines and/or interstellar absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite show that ly@xmath0  lines from lbgs are redshifted against h@xmath0 lines up to several hundreds kms@xmath4  with an average of @xmath85 = + 445kms@xmath4 , while the interstellar absorption lines are blueshifted against the nebular lines by @xmath86 = @xmath62kms@xmath4 .",
    "while these @xmath7  and @xmath59  offsets are interpreted as an outflow signature , it is not clear how the absorbing material is distributed around galaxies .",

    "therefore , any wind arising from galactic star formation has a lower expansion velocity in these two labs than is typical of lbgs .",

    "we examine how these assumptions may affect our conclusions and comment on the recent model suggested by @xcite to explain the circum - galactic kinematics of lbgs .",
    "we have assumed that there is gas inflowing or outflowing along the los to the embedded galaxies that lie in our spectroscopic slit . in this case , the observed ly@xmath0  photons resonantly scatter in this optically thick infalling / outflowing material until escaping into the los of the observer .",
    "however , we do not know how the blob gas is distributed around the embedded galaxies nor whether it is clumpy or smooth .",
    "for example , the gas flow may not be isotropic .",
    "as in bipolar outflows , a galactic - scale outflow may occur in the direction of minimum ism pressure , which is typically perpendicular to the stellar disk . or , the covering factor of the outflow material , the fraction of emission intercepted by the absorbers , could be rather high , at least 0.5 or up to unity as observed in nearby agns @xcite .",
    "if gas accretion is taking place instead @xcite , numerical simulations suggest that the infall may occur preferentially along filamentary streams @xcite .    if the bulk motion of gas ( either infalling or outflowing ) happens to be mis - aligned with our los , we may underestimate or even fail to detect the relative velocity shifts .",
    "therefore , it is critical to expand the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 comparison to a larger sample to average over any geometric effects and obtain better constraints on the incidence , direction , speed , and isotropy of bulk gas motions in blobs .",
    "if no large values of @xmath75  are measured , even for a larger sample , outflows are unlikely to push the blob gas to larger radii , where it can be illuminated . on the other hand",
    ", an absence of blueshifted ly@xmath0  lines would argue that infall is not dominant , at least not near the galaxies .",
    "recent cosmological simulations including radiative transfer are now able to examine the statistics of blobs whose extended ly@xmath0  emission arises from cooling radiation .",
    "these models can predict the range of gas accretion covering factors , surface brightness profiles and ratio of blue - to - redshifted ly@xmath0  lines for blobs . a larger sample of blobs with measured ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 kinematics would provide a new test of these blob emission models .",
    "our second key assumption is that the h@xmath0 line marks the kinematic center of the surrounding gas , i.e. , the terminus of any infall or the origin of any outflow . for an outflow ,",
    "this assumption is reasonable because all possible causes of the outflow ( e.g. , stellar winds , sne , or agns ) lie in or about galaxies , as does the h@xmath0 line itself . for similar reasons , this assumption is likely to be valid for gas accretion ( infall ) into an embedded galaxy .",
    "however , it is possible that the accreting gas responds to the overall dm potential rather than to individual galaxies .",
    "thus one could expect that detecting gas infall is more difficult than finding outflows using the technique presented in this paper .    to overcome this issue",
    ", it is critical to increase the sample size and measure how each blob s ly@xmath0  profile varies spatially .",
    "this experiment should be conducted along multiple sightlines using using different h@xmath0 sources found in the same blob . in principle , it is possible to compare the offsets between the extended ly@xmath0  and and the _ extended _",

    "the velocity of the clumpy medium continually increases outward , unlike in the radiative transfer models discussed earlier , where the outflowing shell had one velocity . in the @xcite model ,",
    "the velocity range spanned by the absorption lines reflects that of the surrounding gas distribution , and the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offset does _ not _ represent the outflow velocity .",
    "if this clumpy cgm model is applicable to blobs , then our observations of a small ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offset could indicate an absence of neutral gas at @xmath52 rather than the weak gas outflow suggested by the rt models .",
    "one test would be to constrain the interstellar absorption line profile , which should extend to larger blueward velocities , but lack a component around @xmath89kms@xmath4 , if the clumpy model is accurate .",
    "clearly , higher s / n spectra to reliably measure these weak absorption lines are required .",
    "the most notable outcome of the large spatial extent of a clumpy cgm around star - forming galaxies is diffuse ly@xmath0-emitting halos .",
    "extended ly@xmath0  emission has been detected in stacked narrowband images of lbgs by @xcite .",
    "more recently , by stacking deeper narrowband ly@xmath0  images of lbgs , @xcite show that all classes of star - forming galaxies exhibit diffuse ly@xmath0  halos out to projected radii of @xmath680kpc , regardless of their spectroscopic properties ( i.e. , either absorption or emission in ly@xmath0  within a spectroscopic slit ) , although these halos are 10@xmath29 lower surface brightness than typical blobs .",
    "the ly@xmath0surface brightness profiles of the stacked images are similar among lbg subclasses , with only different intensity scalings .",
    "thus , ly@xmath0  blobs may represent the most extreme example of galaxies with diffuse ly@xmath0  halos .",
    "the key difference of the clumpy cgm model is that the diffuse ly@xmath0  halo originates from ly@xmath0  photons scattered from the galaxy s region(s ) rather than from external mechanisms such as photoionization by agn , photoionzation by metagalactic uv background radiation , or via cooling radiation .    at this time",
    ", the applicability of the clumpy model to ly@xmath0  blobs is unclear .",
    "any comprehensive model must explain the differences between our blobs and lbgs : 1 ) a comparison of their number density and clustering properties suggests that blobs could occupy higher density environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2 ) the extended emission of blobs is typically 10 times brighter , 3 ) the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offset of our blobs is lower .",
    "the first and second differences could arise if the blobs host more massive galaxies and higher star formation rates than typical of star - forming galaxies at high-@xmath9 .",
    "it remains to be tested whether star formation in the galaxies embedded in blobs can produce enough ly@xmath0  photons to explain the higher luminosity and surface brightness of ly@xmath0  halos .",
    "the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offset is clearly tied in some way to the extended ly@xmath0  emission of our blobs , as it is unusually low for both blobs compared to the offset distribution for lbgs ( see also * ? ? ? * for compact ly@xmath0  emitters ) . it would interesting to check whether the lbg subclasses in @xcite with brighter extended emission have smaller ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offsets and weaker is absorption at @xmath89kms@xmath4  than the others . for now",
    ", we note that the rt outflow model discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] adequately explains the sense and magnitude of both the ly@xmath0h@xmath0 and the h@xmath0-interstellar absorption line offsets in lab02 , whereas the @xcite model would require this agreement of the offsets to be a coincidence . of course",
    ", we are only able to perform this test using one blob at present . as stressed earlier , a larger sample of ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offsets is required to test whether smaller ly@xmath0h@xmath0 offsets are generic properties of ly@xmath0  blobs .",
    "determining the source of ly@xmath0  emission in extended nebulae at high redshift requires that we measure their gas kinematics with an optically - thin line such as h@xmath0 @xmath16563 , which , unlike the optically - thick ly@xmath0  emission , is not much altered by radiative transfer effects and is more concentrated about the blob s core .",
    "the comparison of the ly@xmath0and h@xmath0 line centers then constrains any infall or outflow of the ly@xmath0-emitting gas relative to the systemic velocity of the blob defined by h@xmath0 .",
    "we obtain optical and nir spectra of the two brightest ly@xmath0  blobs ( cdfs - lab01 and cdfs - lab02 ) from the @xcite sample using the magellan / mage optical and vlt / sinfoni nir spectrographs . both the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 lines confirm that these blobs lie at the survey redshift , @xmath90 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the blobs contain several h@xmath0 sources , which roughly coincide with galaxies in _ hst _ rest - frame uv images .",
    "the h@xmath0 detections of these embedded galaxies reveal large internal velocity dispersions ( @xmath3kms@xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the one system ( lab01 ) where we can reliably extract profiles for two different h@xmath0 sources , their velocity difference is @xmath5 @xmath6 440kms@xmath4 .",
    "the presence of multiple galaxies within the blobs , and those galaxies large velocity dispersions and large relative motion , supports the result of @xcite that ly@xmath0  blobs inhabit massive dark matter halos that will evolve into rich clusters today .",
    "the embedded galaxies may represent the precursors of brightest cluster galaxies .    to determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly infalling or outflowing",
    ", we compare the ly@xmath0  and h@xmath0 line centers .",
    "ly@xmath0  is not offset ( @xmath7  = + 0kms@xmath4 ) in lab01 and redshifted by only + 230kms@xmath4  in lab02 .",
    "these offsets are small compared to those of lyman break galaxies , which average + 450kms@xmath4   and extend to about + 700kms@xmath4  @xcite . by comparing the observed ly@xmath0  profiles with simple radiative transfer models , we constrain the outflow velocity from the embedded galaxies to be @xmath60  150kms@xmath4  in the two blobs . in lab02 , we detect low - ionization , interstellar absorption lines , including @xmath11334 and @xmath11526 , whose blueward shifts of @xmath8kms@xmath4  are consistent with the small outflow implied by the redward shift of ly@xmath0 . models with simple infall geometries or that require outflow velocities exceeding @xmath6500kms@xmath4   are ruled out . because of the unknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiple sources of ly@xmath0  emission embedded in the blobs , a larger sample and more sophisticated models are required to test other infall and outflow scenarios .",
