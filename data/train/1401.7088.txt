    "energy efficiency has become one of the highly desirable characteristics of the future wireless cellular networks .",
    "conventional energy saving methods aim to reduce the transmit power of the base stations ( bss ) ; however , recent studies have shown that 60 - 80% of the energy consumed per bs is static ( i.e. , due to battery backup , internal processing , air conditioning , etc . ) and independent of traffic load @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has also been reported that bss are largely underutilized , i.e. , the fraction of time during which traffic load remains below 10% is estimated to be 30% in weekdays and 45% at weekends @xcite .",
    "thus , the traffic fluctuations provide a significant margin to improve the overall network energy efficiency by allowing the underutilized bss to sleep  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , maintaining the coverage and spectral efficiency of transmission for the users in sleeping cells is an important issue that needs careful investigation . in this regard , techniques such as cell - breathing ( or cell - zooming )",
    "@xcite and coordinated multi - point transmissions ( comp ) @xcite are envisioned to provide coverage to the sleeping cell users and establish a balance between the overall network performance and energy savings .",
    "the performance of bs sleeping has been analyzed in several algorithmic and simulation - centric studies with different scenarios , assumptions , and network parameters ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite ,",
    "optimal energy savings are calculated as a function of the daily traffic pattern while ignoring the wireless link factors . in @xcite ,",
    "network energy consumption is minimized by adjusting the cell sizes when bs sleeping is performed .",
    "nevertheless , the transmit power required by the active bss to provide coverage to sleeping cell users , i.e. , effect of cell - zooming is ignored in the energy efficiency analysis @xcite .",
    "other interesting studies optimize network utility functions , e.g. , minimize energy expenditure by optimizing the bs activity with traffic load constraints @xcite and minimize a weighted combination of power consumption and delay to optimize the service rate @xcite .",
    "recently , few analytical frameworks have considered to derive the optimal density of sleeping bss  @xcite , proposed distributed sleeping mechanisms considering cognitive small cells @xcite , and developed different bs switching - off schemes @xcite .",
    "the development of such frameworks is highly desirable to capture the joint interplay among the network design parameters while extracting in - depth theoretical insights behind various observations and performance trends .",
    "a power minimization problem with coverage constraint for a randomly selected sleeping cell user is formulated in @xcite such that the bs density is optimized considering random and traffic load - based sleeping . to avoid coverage holes , power of all active bss",
    "is assumed to increase equally regardless of the channel conditions of the sleeping cell users . due to the complexity of closed - form solution ,",
    "an optimal value of bs density is computed numerically . in @xcite ,",
    "a bs density minimization problem is formulated with coverage constraints of users in sleeping cells .",
    "however , the expression for coverage includes two improper integrals and an infinite summation .",
    "therefore , the authors opt to derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal bs density .",
    "a distance - aware bs switching algorithm is presented in @xcite that recommends to switch - off a bs with maximum average distance from its own and neighboring cell users . in @xcite",
    "four heuristic - based bs switching - off patterns are proposed and the coordination among the bss is exploited to provide coverage to the sleeping cell users .",
    "the aforementioned studies mainly focus on improving the energy efficiency of cellular networks by either optimizing the density of active bss with certain coverage constraint for the sleeping cell users or proposing different switching - off schemes / patterns and analyzing their relative performance gains .",
    "the impact of channel availability on the performance of sleeping cell users , which depends on the scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the active bss , has been largely ignored in the previous studies .",
    "for example , under same traffic load conditions , if an active bs uses greedy scheduling on a given transmission channel , the probability of channel availability to a sleeping cell user is significantly low compared to that for round - robin scheduling .",
    "the multi - user scheduling criteria used at the active bss have a direct consequence on the channel access probability and the achieved spectral efficiency of transmission to the sleeping cell users as well as the spectral and energy efficiencies of the entire network .    in the above context ,",
    "given a number of active bss or switching - off pattern , this paper develops a rigorous analytical framework to derive the spectral efficiency as well as the outage probability of a typical user in the underutilized sleeping cells .",
    "we assume that all bss share the same transmission channels and perform scheduling on each transmission channel depending on the network objective ( e.g. , throughput maximization or fairness maximization ) . the coverage to sleeping cell users is ensured by exploiting the bs zooming capabilities .",
    "the major contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .   this paper develops a systematic framework to characterize the performance of cellular systems with bs sleeping .",
    "the framework captures the impact of channel availability on the performance of a typical sleeping cell user which depends on the channel conditions of the sleeping cell user towards the active bss and traffic loads at the active bss ( or the scheduling criteria used at the active bss ) . considering both greedy and round - robin scheduling schemes at the active bss and their existing traffic loads , for a typical sleeping cell user",
    ", we derive the _ best - case mean channel access probability _ ( i.e. , the highest probability of obtaining a channel allocation , which is spatially averaged over the cellular region ) corresponding to the different active bss .",
    "2 .   based on the derived best - case channel access probabilities ,",
    "we develop a user association scheme in which a typical user in a sleeping cell selects a bs ( among all active bss ) with the maximum best - case mean channel access probability ( mmap ) .",
    "once the association is performed , the exact access probability for a typical sleeping cell user and the statistics of its received signal and interference powers are derived .",
    "we compare this with conventional maximum received signal power ( mrsp)-based user association scheme .",
    "we show that mrsp - based association may not always be the best choice and that the channel access probabilities from active bss serve as a useful user association metric .",
    "design guidelines are also provided for simple hybrid schemes that can be implemented to overcome the drawbacks of mmap and mrsp - based user association schemes .",
    "3 .   the outage probability and spectral efficiency of a typical sleeping cell user",
    "are then evaluated .",
    "the impact of cell - zooming on reducing the coverage holes is analyzed . to reduce the complexity of evaluation based on the exact analytical expressions , we also present an approximate approach to characterize the performance of a typical sleeping cell user in all considered scenarios .",
    "4 .   finally , for various network scenarios , the trade - offs between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency are captured and the accuracy of the analysis is validated through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the feasibility of bs sleeping is analyzed by quantifying the transmit power required at a given active bs to maintain the throughput of a sleeping cell user as it was before ( i.e. , when its corresponding bs was active ) .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that the required zooming power depends significantly on the scheduling criteria used at the active bss and the association scheme used by the sleeping cell users .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii details the network and channel models , mmap and mrsp - based association schemes for users in the sleeping cells , distance distributions , power consumption model , and also outlines the methodology of analysis . in section  iii ,",
    "we derive the best - case mean channel access probability of a sleeping cell user considering greedy and round - robin schemes at the active bss .",
    "based on this , in section  iv , we derive the association probabilities for a sleeping cell user with different active bss considering both mmap and mrsp - based associations . also , derive expressions for the exact channel access probability and received signal and interference powers for the sleeping cell user depending on the user association schemes .",
    "next , in section v , we derive coverage and spectral efficiency expressions for all considered cases .",

    "each bs selects a user on a given transmission channel or subcarrier in orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) networks considering a predefined scheduling criterion .",
    "multi - user scheduling on each transmission channel is required to assign resources such that the desired network objective ( e.g. , maximize throughput , maximize fairness ) can be achieved @xcite . in this",
    "regard , various scheduling schemes are available in the literature .",
    "for example , greedy scheduling maximizes the throughput on each channel by selecting a user with best received signal power . on the other hand , the well - known round - robin scheduling @xcite maximizes the system fairness by selecting a user arbitrarily regardless of its channel conditions .",
    "proportional fair @xcite and opportunistic round - robin @xcite are two other popular scheduling schemes that lie in between the two extremes in terms of throughput and fairness trade - off . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the greedy and round - robin schemes for scheduling users on a given transmission channel . our main motivation for this is to investigate the impacts of two extreme scheduling schemes ( one of which maximizes cell throughput while the other maximizes fairness among users in a cell ) on the spectral and energy efficiencies of transmission to sleeping cell users .",
    "we assume that accurate channel state information ( csi ) available at the bs to implement greedy ( i.e. , opportunistic ) scheduling on a transmission channel .",
    "the fraction of sleeping bss is represented by @xmath25 , and consequently , the number of sleeping and active bss can be given as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the sets of sleeping and active bss are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . a graphical illustration of the considered system model with first tier of circular macrocells is shown in fig .",
    "[ multi - tier ] .",
    "the sets of sleeping and active bss are illustrated graphically for two different switching - off patterns and a typical user of interest is shown to be located in sleeping cell @xmath30 .",
    "the number of inactive cells @xmath31 and their locations can be selected either by using different switching - off patterns @xcite or by specifying a certain number of users @xmath32 that represents a low - load condition , i.e. , a bs remains inactive if the number of users in the corresponding cell is less than or equal to @xmath32 .",
    "the active bss provide coverage to the users in sleeping cells by increasing their transmit power .",
    "the users in the active bss are assumed to remain associated with their closest bs .",
    "we consider two user association schemes , namely , ( i ) * * m**aximum * * m**ean channel * * a**ccess * * p**robability ( mmap ) and ( ii ) * * m**aximum * * r**eceived * * s**ignal * * p**ower ( mrsp ) schemes , for sleeping cell users .",
    "mmap represents a user association scheme in which a typical user of interest in sleeping cell @xmath30 associates to the bs @xmath33 from which it has the maximum chance of obtaining the channel allocation , i.e. , a bs which offers the maximum access probability .",
    "we assume that the mean channel access probability of a sleeping cell user from an active bs @xmath34 is broadcast by bs @xmath34 immediately after some bss in the network become inactive and when any potential sleeping cell user asserts a request for this information from bs @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the mmap - based association is a network - assisted user association scheme in which a sleeping cell user selects the bs given the mean channel access probabilities provided by different active bss . nonetheless , since more than one sleeping cell users can associate to this bs , this mean channel access probability depends on the original number of users associated to bs @xmath34 and may not reflect the exact channel access probability that a sleeping cell user will experience after associating to bs @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore refer to this probability as the _ best - case mean channel access probability_. note that the mmap - based user association depends on the scheduling scheme used at the base station and hence depends on the traffic loads at the active cells and the channel conditions of the sleeping cell users towards the active bss .",
    "mrsp represents the conventional user association scheme where a user of interest selects a bs from which it experiences the maximum instantaneous received signal power .",
    "this criterion requires instantaneous channel information at a user from all active bss and is independent of channel access probabilities and thus the traffic load conditions corresponding to the different active bss .    for illustration ,",
    "consider a scenario shown in first part of fig .",
    "[ multi - tier ] , where @xmath35 in the coverage area of bs@xmath36 ( which is in sleep mode ) may associate to bs@xmath37 or bs@xmath38 with mmap and mrsp - based associations , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 will associate to bs@xmath37 or bs@xmath40 with mmap and mrsp - based association , respectively .",
    "however , since bs@xmath37 is quite far from @xmath39 , a better option for @xmath39 might be to associate with bs@xmath41 rather than with bs@xmath37 based on a _ hybrid _ user association scheme , which takes into account both traffic load and channel condition . note that , in this paper we primarily focus on mmap and mrsp - based association schemes .",
    "design guidelines for simple hybrid schemes that overcome the drawbacks of both mmap and mrsp user association schemes will be provided in section  v.      the total network power consumption before bs sleeping is modeled as  @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the static power consumption due to signal processing overhead ( @xmath44 ) , battery backup and power supply losses ( @xmath45 ) , and cooling losses ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 represents the slope of load - dependent power consumption of the battery backup , cooling , and power supply losses as well as power amplifier efficiency  @xcite .",
    "when a fraction of @xmath25 bss are allowed to sleep , the reduced power consumption can be given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bs power consumption while sleeping ; however , it is negligibly small compared to the static power consumption @xcite . to avoid coverage holes , the amount of increase in transmit power required per channel",
    "is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a scaling factor , i.e. , @xmath52 when cell - zooming is performed and @xmath53 for no cell - zooming scenario .",
    "note that a bs will zoom if any of the associated sleeping cell users is selected for transmission .",

    "the distribution of the distance @xmath69 can then be given as follows @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "note that , the distance @xmath67 depends on the sleeping bs @xmath60 whose user is under consideration and reference active bs @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is a variable and it can take any values to incorporate multiple tiers of macrocells .",
    "given a bs switching - off pattern and the sleeping cell @xmath60 of interest , @xmath67 can be determined from all active bss and the corresponding distributions of @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be obtained accordingly ( see fig .  [ multi - tier ] ) .",
    "for instance , if the central bs is sleeping and an active bs is located in second , third , or @xmath74 tier , @xmath67 will change to @xmath75 , or @xmath76 accordingly .    in general , shadowing and fading channels can be jointly modeled by composite fading distributions .",
    "the generalized-@xmath5 distribution has been proposed recently in which the shadowing as well as fading channels are modeled by the gamma distribution @xcite . as the pdf , cdf , and mgf of the generalized-@xmath5 distribution involve computation - intensive special functions such as ` meijer - g ` and ` whittaker ` functions , we approximate the distribution with a more tractable gamma distribution using the moment matching method , i.e. , @xmath77@xcite . by matching the first and second moments of the two distributions , the corresponding values of @xmath1 and @xmath2",

    "a simple hybrid user association criterion is one in which a sleeping cell user selects a bs dynamically considering its received signal power from all active bss as well as their corresponding channel access probabilities , e.g. , @xmath217 .",
    "this criterion restricts the users from associating to a congested bs despite a high signal power received from that bs . in this case , the channel access probabilities serve as a weight to the corresponding received signal powers from active bss and thus implicitly tend to balance the traffic load among the active bss .",
    "another possible strategy is to select a set of bss within a certain region of vicinity and obtain the corresponding channel access probabilities .",

    "this scheme is expected to perform significantly better than mmap - based association with round - robin scheduling .      in this paper , we focus on the spectral efficiency of sleeping cell users . however , a similar analysis can also be performed for local users of an active bs @xmath34 .",
    "note that the local users in a bs @xmath34 remain associated to bs @xmath34 ; therefore , we need to derive only the exact access probability of such users after the association of sleeping cell users .",

    "<S> base station ( bs ) sleeping has emerged as a viable solution to enhance the overall network energy efficiency by inactivating the underutilized bss . </S>",
    "<S> however , it affects the performance of users in sleeping cells depending on their bs association criteria , their channel conditions towards the active bss , and scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the active bss . </S>",
    "<S> this paper characterizes the performance of cellular systems with bs sleeping by developing a systematic framework to derive the spectral efficiency and outage probability of downlink transmission to the sleeping cell users taking into account the aforementioned factors . in this context , we develop a user association scheme in which a typical user in a sleeping cell selects a bs with * * m**aximum best - case * * m**ean channel * * a**ccess * * p**robability ( mmap ) which is calculated by all active bss based on their existing traffic loads . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both greedy and round - robin schemes at active bss for scheduling users in a channel . </S>",
    "<S> once the association is performed , the exact access probability for a typical sleeping cell user and the statistics of its received signal and interference powers are derived to evaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of transmission . for the sleeping cell users , </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the conventional * * m**aximum * * r**eceived * * s**ignal * * p**ower ( mrsp)-based user association scheme along with greedy and round - robin schemes at the bss . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of cell - zooming is incorporated in the derivations to analyze its feasibility in reducing the coverage holes created by bs sleeping . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show the trade - offs between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in various network scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the analysis is verified through monte - carlo simulations .    base station ( bs ) sleeping , cell - zooming , downlink transmission , spectral efficiency , energy efficiency , user association , greedy and round - robin scheduling . </S>"
