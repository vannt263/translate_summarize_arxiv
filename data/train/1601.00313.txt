    "understanding the factors that influence the capability of a group of individuals to solve problems is a central issue on collective intelligence @xcite and on organizational design @xcite , nonetheless the meager interchange of ideas between these two research areas .",
    "conventional wisdom says that a group of cooperating individuals can solve a problem faster than the same group of individuals working in isolation , and that the higher the diversity of the group members , the better the performance .",
    "although there has been some progress on the quantitative understanding of the factors that make cooperative group work effective @xcite , only very recently a workable minimal agent - based model of distributed cooperative problem solving system was proposed @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "here we build on that model to dispute some common - sense views of the benefits of diversity in group organization .",
    "we consider a distributed cooperative problem solving system in which agents cooperate by broadcasting messages informing on their partial success towards the completion of the goal and use this information to imitate the more successful agent ( model ) in the system . in doing so , we follow bloom in conferring imitative learning the central role in the emergence of collective intelligence : `` imitative learning acts like a synapse , allowing information to leap the gap from one creature to another '' @xcite . the parameters of the model are the number of agents in the system @xmath0 and the copy or imitation propensities @xmath1 $ ] of agent @xmath2 .",
    "previous analyses have considered the homogeneous case only , @xmath3 @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case that the copy propensities are random variables instead , and measure the system performance by the time @xmath4 the system requires to find the solution of the task .",
    "we find that endowing the agents with different copy propensities can greatly reduce the chances that the system is temporarily trapped in sub - optimal solutions ( local maxima ) , which is a very likely outcome of the imitative search for large homogeneous systems @xcite .",
    "however , in the regime of system sizes where that search strategy is more effective than the independent search , diversity impairs the system performance and the optimal performance is achieved by the homogeneous system .",
    "the task posed to the agents is to find the unique global maximum of a fitness landscape generated using kauffman s nk model @xcite .",
    "this model allows the tuning of the ruggedness of the landscape  and hence of the difficulty of the task  by changing the integer parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "more pointedly , the nk landscape is defined in the space of binary strings of length @xmath5 and so this parameter determines the size of the solution space , namely , @xmath7 .",
    "the other parameter @xmath8 is the degree of epistasis that has a direct influence on the number of local maxima on the landscape . in particular , for @xmath9 the ( smooth ) landscape has a single maximum , whereas for @xmath10 , the ( uncorrelated ) landscape has on the average @xmath11 maxima with respect to single bit flips and the nk model reduces to the random energy model @xcite",
    ".    the nk model associates a fitness value @xmath12 to each binary string @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , which is given by an average of the contributions from each entry of the string , i.e. , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the contribution of entry @xmath17 to the fitness of the string @xmath18 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 depends on the state @xmath19 as well as on the states of the @xmath6 right neighbors of @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath20 with the arithmetic in the subscripts done modulo @xmath5 .",
    "this is the reason the parameter @xmath6 is known as the degree of epistasis : it measures the degree of interaction ( epistasis ) among entries of the strings .",
    "in addition , we assign to each @xmath16 a uniformly distributed random number in the unit interval @xcite , which guarantees that @xmath21 has a unique global maximum . finding",
    "this maximum for @xmath22 is a np - complete problem @xcite , which means that the time required to solve the problem using any currently known deterministic algorithm increases exponentially fast with the length @xmath5 of the strings @xcite . for @xmath9 the sole maximum of @xmath23",
    "is easily located by picking for each entry @xmath17 the state @xmath24 if @xmath25 or the state @xmath26 , otherwise .",
    "finally , we note that the correlation between the fitness of any two neighboring configurations ( i.e. , configurations that differ by a single entry ) is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , regardless of the value of the entry @xmath17 .",
    "we consider a system composed of @xmath0 agents and assume that each agent can interact with all the others ( see @xcite for the study of more complex connection patterns ) .",
    "each agent operates in an initial binary string drawn at random with equal probability for the bits @xmath30 and @xmath31 . at any trial @xmath32 , agent",
    "@xmath33 can choose between two distinct processes to operate on its associated string .",
    "the first process , which happens with probability @xmath34 , is a random , exploratory move in the solution space that consists of flipping a single randomly selected bit of the binary string . the second process , which happens with probability @xmath35 , is the imitation of a model string , i.e. , the string with the highest fitness value among the @xmath0 strings at the trial .",
    "the imitation or copy process is implemented as follows .",
    "first the target string @xmath36 is compared with the model string @xmath37 and the different bits are singled out",
    ". then the agent selects at random one of the distinct bits and flips it so that this bit is now the same in both strings . as a result of the imitation process",
    "the target string becomes more similar to the model string . in the case",
    "the string @xmath36 is identical to the model string , the agent executes the exploratory move with probability one .",
    "the imitation procedure was motivated by the mechanism used to simulate the influence of an external media @xcite in the celebrated agent - based model proposed by axelrod to study the process of culture dissemination @xcite .",
    "this procedure sets our model apart from a similar model studied in the management and organizations literature @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where the imitation mechanism is such that the target string becomes identical to the model string after imitation .",
    "this non - incremental change may permanently stuck the search in a local maximum . in that context",
    ", the exploratory move is called exploration , since the agent may generate new information , and the copying process , exploitation , since the agent uses information that is already present in the system @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 $ ] is the imitation or copy propensity of agent @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath38 then agent @xmath36 will explore the solution space independently of the other agents . in previous studies of this model",
    "@xcite we assumed that the @xmath0 agents exhibited the same imitation behavior , i.e. , @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "here we introduce variety in the behavior of the agents by endowing them with different copy propensities .",
    "in particular , we consider the case that the @xmath35 s are identically distributed independent random variables drawn from the uniform probability distribution @xmath41 for @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 otherwise , as well as the case that they are drawn from the trimodal distribution @xmath44 since in both cases we have @xmath45 , a suitable homogeneous system that can serve as standard for gauging the benefits of diversity is that for which @xmath46 for @xmath40 .",
    "we note that in the case of the trimodal distribution we consider only realizations which exhibit all the three different values of the copy propensities , regardless of their proportions .",
    "the search ends only when one of the agents finds the global maximum and we denote by @xmath4 the number of trials made by the agent that found the solution .",
    "since the trial number @xmath32 is incremented by one unit when the @xmath0 agents have executed one of the two operations on its associated string , @xmath4 stands also for the number of trials made by any one of the @xmath0 agents in the system .",
    "hence the total number of agent updates necessary to find the global maximum is @xmath47 and so the computational cost of the search can be defined as @xmath48 , where for convenience we have rescaled @xmath4 by the size of the solution space @xmath7 .",
    "we note that the update of the @xmath0 agents in a trial is sequential and so the model strings may change several times within the same trial .",
    "since the complexity of the task is a key element to be considered when determining the organization that maximizes the problem - solving performance of the system @xcite , we study imitative searches on easy tasks , i.e. , smooth nk landscapes with a single maximum ( @xmath9 ) , and on more difficult tasks , i.e. , rugged nk landscapes characterized by the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for each realization of a fitness landscape we carry out @xmath51 searches starting from different initial conditions ( initial strings and copy - propensity realizations ) and the averaged results are then averaged again over at least @xmath52 realizations of landscapes characterized by the same values of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath22 . in the case @xmath9 all landscapes are equivalent and so we do not need to average over different realizations .       as function of the system size @xmath0 for a system of identical agents with @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , a system of agents with @xmath35 uniformly distributed in the unit interval ( @xmath55 ) , and a system of agents with @xmath35 generated using a trimodal distribution ( @xmath56 ) . the symbols @xmath57 are the results for the independent search ( @xmath58 ) and the symbols @xmath59 for the imitative search with @xmath60 .",

    "we note that , for a landscape without local maxima , the best performance of the imitative search is achieved by setting @xmath69 for all agents ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1_m18_k0 ] ) , since copying the fittest string at the trial is always a certain step towards the solution of the problem @xcite .",
    "this is the reason the trimodal distribution gives the best performance among the three distributions with @xmath70 exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig1_m18_k0 ] : it simply produces systems with a large proportion of experts ( i.e. , agents with @xmath69 ) .",
    "in fact , we have verified that a bimodal distribution , in which half of the agents have @xmath71 and the other half @xmath69 , yields a better performance than the trimodal distribution .    for @xmath0 greater than the optimal system size ,",
    "we observe two distinct growth regimes of the computational cost . the first regime , which occurs for @xmath72 and holds over for nearly three decades for the data of fig .",
    "[ fig1_m18_k0 ] , is characterized by a sublinear growth @xmath73 with @xmath74 and signals a scenario of mild negative synergy among the agents since the time @xmath4 necessary to find the global maximum decreases with @xmath75 rather than with @xmath76 as in the case of the independent search ( absence of synergy ) .",
    "although this regime is important because for large @xmath5 it is the only growth regime that can be observed in the simulations , the specific value of the exponent @xmath77 is not very informative since it depends on the distribution of the copy propensities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1_m18_k0 ] ) and it increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , for the uniform distribution we found @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath64 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the second regime , which takes place for @xmath83 , is described by the linear function @xmath84 and corresponds to the situation where the system size is so large that the solution is found in the first trials . in this regime , @xmath4 is not affected by the value of @xmath0 , i.e. , adding more agents to the system does not decrease the time required to find the solution .",
    "finally , we note that for @xmath9 the imitative search always performs better than the independent search .     between the standard deviation of the computational cost and its mean value as function of the system size @xmath0 for the different system compositions shown in fig .",

    "clearly , @xmath86 also gives the ratio between the standard deviation of the time required to find the global maximum @xmath4 and its means value .",
    "in the regime that @xmath87 , the distribution of the computational cost can be well described by an exponential distribution , though we note that the correct distribution in the case of the independent search is the geometric distribution @xcite .",

    "this is akin to the groupthink phenomenon @xcite , when everyone in a group starts thinking alike , which can occur when people put unlimited faith in a talented leader ( the model strings , in our case ) .",
    "the finding that these traps can be circumvented by endowing the agents with different parameters of the behavioral rules is a main thrust of the arguments pro diversity to boost system performance @xcite .",
    "our results corroborate that viewpoint since the heterogeneous systems exhibit an overall performance slightly superior to the independent search , which , we recall , is not affected by the presence or absence of local maxima .",
    "the surprising finding , however , is that for small system sizes , where the imitative search can be said to be efficient in the sense that @xmath4 decreases superlinearly with increasing @xmath0 @xcite , the homogeneous system performs best .    the properly rescaled deviations around the mean values of the computational cost are shown in fig .",
