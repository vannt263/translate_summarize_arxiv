    "our consideration is based on the well - known high energy phenomenology : energy dependence of the regge trajectories and the scaling behaviour of the hadronic amplitudes .",
    "we found distinct decreasing of the ratio of the @xmath0 production compared to the background processes in diffractive processes and exclusive reactions with large momentum transfers . in the fragmentation region at high energy , this ratio is rather small .",
    "our estimation is done on the base of the fragmentation - recombination model but it has a general character and is valid for any model ( for example , the relativistic string model ) .",
    "physically , the @xmath0-pentaquark production in the fragmentation region is accompanied by creation of additional 2 quark - antiquark ( diquark - antidiquark ) pairs with subsequent pick quarks up by the outgoing hadron .",
    "this results in additional suppression factor @xmath96 with @xmath97",
    ". it may be worthwhile the point out that there will be no suppression with increasing energy in the central rapidity regions in inclusive reactions .",
