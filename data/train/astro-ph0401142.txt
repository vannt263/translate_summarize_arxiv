    "for the long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the cosmological distance , the collimated jet , the massive star progenitor , and the association with the supernova are almost established or strongly suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for short grbs , little is known since no afterglow has been observed .",
    "the origin of the x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) also remains unclear although many models have been proposed ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the observed event rate of short grbs is about a third of the long grbs while the observed event rate of xrfs is also about a third @xcite .",
    "although there may be a possible bias effect to these statistics , in an astrophysical sense , these numbers are the same or comparable . if these three phenomena arise from essentially different origins , the similar number of events is just by chance . while if these three phenomena are related like seyfert  1 and 2 galaxies , the similar number of events is natural and the ratio of the event rate tells us something about the geometry of the central engine @xcite . in this letter , we propose a unified model in which the central engine of short grbs , long grbs and xrfs is the same and the apparent differences come essentially from different viewing angles .",
    "it is suggested that short grbs are similar to the first 1 sec of long grbs @xcite .",
    "although short grbs are harder than long grbs @xcite , this difference is mainly due to the difference in the low - energy spectral slope while the peak energy is similar @xcite .",
    "other properties , such as @xmath3 , the angular distribution , the energy dependence of duration and the hard - to - soft spectral evolution of short grbs , are also similar to those of long grbs @xcite .",
    "if short grbs also obey the peak energy - luminosity relation found for the long grbs @xcite , it is suggested that short and long grbs have a similar redshift distribution @xcite .",
    "these similarities suggest that the difference between short and long grbs is just the number of pulses , and each pulse is essentially the same @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_flu_dur ] , using 4br catalogue of batse @xcite , the fluence is roughly in proportion to the duration in the range of 0.01 to 1000 sec ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we may consider that each pulse is produced by essentially the same unit or the sub - jet , and the grb jet consists of many sub - jets .",
    "if many sub - jets point to our line of sight , the event looks like the long grb while if a single sub - jet points to us , the event looks like a short grb . since we can observe only the angular size of @xmath4 within the grb jet with the lorentz factor @xmath5 , different observers will see different number of sub - jets depending on the distribution of sub - jets within the grb jet . since the angular size of a causally connected region is",
    "also @xmath6 , the opening half - angle of a sub - jet can be much smaller than that of the whole grb jet ( @xmath7 ) , say @xmath8 .",
    "xrfs also appear to be related to grbs .",
    "softer and dimmer grbs smoothly extend to the xrfs @xcite , while the peak energy - isotropic luminosity / energy relations hold for grbs as well as xrfs @xcite . the total energy including the radio afterglow of xrf  020903 , which has a measured redshift , might be similar to that of grbs @xcite . other properties , such as the duration ,",
    "the temporal structure and the band spectrum of the xrfs are also similar to those of the grbs , suggesting that xrfs are in fact soft and dim grbs . in the sub - jet model ,",
    "xrfs are naturally expected when our line of sight is off - axis to any sub - jets @xcite .",
    "the origin of sub - jets is not yet clear . in this letter",
    ", we do not discuss the origin of the sub - jets , but argue the implications of the sub - jet model .",
    "we first show a numerical simulation to demonstrate how the event looks so different depending on the viewing angle in our unified model .",
    "let us consider @xmath9 sub - jets , for simplicity , confined in the whole grb jet whose axis is the same as a @xmath10 axis . for each sub - jet",
    "the emission model is the same as in @xcite .",
    "let the opening half - angle of the @xmath11-th sub - jet ( @xmath12 ) be @xmath13 , while the opening half - angle of the whole jet be @xmath14 .",
    "the direction of the observer and the axis of the @xmath11-th sub - jet are specified by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we assume the @xmath11-th sub - jet departs at time @xmath17 from the central engine and emits at radius @xmath18 and time @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are measured in the central engine frame and we set @xmath22 . for simplicity , all sub - jets are assumed to have the same intrinsic properties , that is @xmath23  rad , @xmath24  , @xmath25  cm , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28  kev and the amplitude @xmath29 for all @xmath11 .",
    "the departure time of each sub - jet , @xmath17 is randomly distributed between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the active time of the central engine measured in its own frame and set to @xmath33  sec .",
    "the opening half - angle of the whole jet is set to @xmath34  rad as a typical value .",
    "we consider the case in which the angular distribution of sub - jets is given by @xmath35 \\,d\\vartheta^\\j\\ , d\\varphi^\\j$ ] for @xmath36 , where we adopt @xmath37  rad @xcite . in this case ,",
    "sub - jets are concentrated on the @xmath10 axis ( i.e. , the multiplicity in the center @xmath38 ) . for our adopted parameters ,",
    "sub - jets are sparsely distributed in the range @xmath39 , however , the whole jet would be entirely filled if the sub - jets were uniformly distributed ( i.e. , the mean multiplicity @xmath40 ) . therefore , isolated sub - jets exist near the edge of the whole jet with the multiplicity @xmath41 and there exists a viewing angle where no sub - jets are launched . figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the angular distributions of sub - jets and the directions of four selected lines of sight , the observed time - integrated spectra , and the observed light curves in the x - ray and @xmath5-ray bands , respectively .",
    "note here in figure  [ fig1 ] , `` a '' represents the center of the whole jet and is hidden by the lines of sub - jets .",
    "_ long grb _ : when we observe the source from the @xmath10 axis ( case  `` a '' ) , we see spiky temporal structures ( fig .",
    "3-a ) and @xmath42  kev which are typical for the long grbs .",
    "we may identify case `` a '' as long grbs .",
    "_ xrf and x - ray rich grb _ : when the line of sight is away from any sub - jets ( cases  `` b@xmath43 '' and `` b@xmath44 '' ) , soft and dim prompt emission , i.e. xrfs or x - ray rich grbs are observed with @xmath45  kev and @xmath46 orders of magnitude smaller fluence than that of case `` a '' ( fig .",
    "the burst duration is comparable to that in case `` a '' .",
    "these are quite similar to the characteristics of xrfs .",
    "we may identify the cases  `` b@xmath43 '' and `` b@xmath44 '' as xrfs or x - ray rich grbs .",
    "_ short grb _ : if the line of sight is inside an isolated sub - jet ( case  `` c '' ) , its observed pulse duration is @xmath47 times smaller than case `` a '' ( fig .",
    "contributions to the observed light curve from the other sub - jets are negligible so that the fluence is about a hundredth of the case `` a '' .",
    "these are quite similar to the characteristics of short grbs .",
    "however the hardness ratio ( @xmath48 ) is about 3 which is smaller than the mean hardness of short grbs ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the hardness of short grbs is due to the large low - energy photon index @xmath50 so that if the central engine launches @xmath50 sub - jets to the periphery of the core where @xmath0 is small , we may identify the case `` c '' as the short - hard grbs .",
    "in other words , the hardness of 3 comes from @xmath51 in our simulation so that if @xmath50 , the hardness will be 6 or so .",
    "we suggest here that not only the isotropic energy but also the photon index may depend on @xmath52 .",
    "another possibility is that if short grbs are the first 1  sec of the activity of the central engine , the spectrum in the early time might be @xmath50 for both the sub - jets in the core and the envelope .",
    "this is consistent with a high ks test probability for @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "these possibilities may have something to do with the origin of @xmath55 for the long grbs .",
    "_ x - ray pre / post - cursor _ : it is quite interesting that in figure  [ fig3 ] , we see the x - ray precursor at @xmath56  sec in `` b@xmath44 '' and the postcursor at @xmath5775  sec in `` b@xmath43 '' .",
    "these can be understood by the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the total duration of the long and short grbs are consistent with the log - normal distributions @xcite . in our sub - jet model",
    ", these distributions may be naturally expected as a result of the central limit theorem .",
    "suppose a certain quantity @xmath58 is expressed by a product of random variables @xmath59 then , @xmath60 when the individual distributions of @xmath61 satisfy certain weak conditions , the distribution of @xmath62 obeys the normal distribution in the limit of @xmath63 by the central limit theorem .",
    "however in some cases the log - normal distributions can be achieved only by a few variables @xcite .",
    "thus we might say , `` astrophysically , not @xmath64 but @xmath65 gives the log - normal distribution in practice ! '' .",
    "this argument may apply to the log - normal distributions of the peak energy , the pulse fluence and the pulse duration of grbs @xcite .    in our sub - jet model ,",
    "the short grbs are due to a single sub - jet .",
    "the pulse duration of a single sub - jet is mainly determined by the angular spreading time scale and is given by the product of four variables in the internal shock model @xcite as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are the separation of two shells , the lorentz factor of the slow and merged shell in the internal shock model , respectively .",
    "therefore the log - normal distribution of the duration of the short grbs may be a natural result of the central limit theorem .    in our unified model , the duration of long grbs",
    "is determined by the interval between pulses @xmath70 times the multiplicity of the sub - jets @xmath71 . for a grb at redshift @xmath72",
    ", the observed duration is given by the product of three random variables , @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the log - normal distribution of the duration of long grbs may be realized .",
    "the ratio of the duration of long grbs to short grbs is given by @xmath74 .",
    "since in the internal shock model the relative lorentz factor is not large , this equation suggests that @xmath75 which is compatible with the observed number of spikes of the long grbs .",
    "let @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 be the typical opening half - angle of the sub - jet , the core size of the whole jet and the mean multiplicity in the core . then the total number of the sub - jets ( @xmath79 ) is estimated as @xmath80 so that the total energy of each sub - jet is @xmath81 erg . in our model ,",
    "the event rate of long grbs is in proportion to @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 be the number of sub - jets in the envelope of the core with a small multiplicity @xmath41 .",
    "then the event rate of short grbs is in proportion to @xmath84 so that @xmath85 is enough to explain the event rate of short grbs .    of course",
    ", the above numerical values are typical ones and should have a dispersion @xcite .",
    "our core - envelope sub - jet model can have a similar structure to the two component jet model @xcite by varying such as @xmath78 and @xmath83 .",
    "however the distribution of sub - jets could also have other possibilities , e.g. , a hollow - cone distribution like a pulsar , a power law distribution , a gaussian distribution @xcite and so on .",
    "some observers could see a cold spot with small @xmath0 in the core to have a small geometrically corrected energy even if the total energy of the grbs is the same .",
    "thus our model may be compatible with the recent claim that the total kinetic energy has smaller dispersion than the geometrically corrected @xmath5-ray energy @xcite .",
    "the x - ray pre-/post - cursor is also expected if off - axis sub - jets are ejected earlier ( for precursor ) or later ( for postcursor ) than the main sub - jets @xcite .",
    "the viewing angle of the sub - jets may also cause the luminosity - lag / variability / width relations of the grbs including grb 980425 @xcite .",
    "this multiple sub - jet model is an extreme case of the inhomogeneous or patchy shell model @xcite .",
    "the afterglow variabilities , such as in grb 021004 , may arise from the angular energy fluctuations within the grb jet @xcite , which might correspond to the inhmogeneous @xmath0 .",
    "since the core may be regarded as a uniform jet , our model for the xrfs is analogous to the off - axis uniform jet model @xcite .",
    "however the afterglow could have a different behavior between the core - envelope sub - jet model and the uniform jet model . in the uniform jet model",
    ", the afterglows of xrfs should resemble the orphan afterglows that initially have a rising light curve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an orphan afterglow may be actually observed in xrf 030723 @xcite , but the light curve may peak too early @xcite . the optical afterglow of xrf 020903 is not observed initially ( @xmath86 days ) but may not be consistent with the orphan afterglow @xcite .",
    "these problems could be overcome by introducing a gaussian tail with a high lorentz factor around the uniform jet @xcite since the energy redistribution effects may bring the rising light curve to earlier times @xcite .",
    "the afterglow of a short grb is difficult to predict since it could resemble both the orphan and normal afterglow depending on the sub - jet configuration within the envelope .",
    "since all bursts have the same progenitor , our model suggests that the short grbs and the xrfs are also associated with supernovae .",
    "the radio calorimetry will also give a similar energy to long grbs because of the same reason .",
    "our unified model will be refuted if the locations of short grbs are mainly in the halo of the galaxy , as in the coalescing binary neutron star model @xcite .",
    "interestingly our model also predicts off - axis short grbs or short xrfs .",
    "however these bursts will be difficult to detect since short xrfs , which have a multiplicity of @xmath87 , will be @xmath88 times dimmer than xrfs with @xmath89 . note that the short xrfs will be longer than the short grbs since the pulse duration grows as the viewing angle increases @xcite .",
    "the event rate of short xrfs will depend on the configuration of the sub - jets in the envelope .",
    "further observations are necessary to determine the envelope structure .",
