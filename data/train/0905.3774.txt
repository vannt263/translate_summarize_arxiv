    "recent progress in microfluidic devices has led to the development of novel separation strategies that take advantage of the unprecedented control on the geometry and chemistry of the stationary phase at scales that are comparable to the size of the transported species @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem that is at the core of several of the proposed separation devices is the transport of brownian particles through entropy barriers .",
    "a representative example is the motion of a suspended particle in a channel with periodically varying cross section .",
    "the purely - diffusive transport in the absence of an external force has been studied extensively @xcite , and a well - known approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem via the fick - jacobs approximation . in this approximation",
    "the motion in the cross section is reduced to an entropic contribution to the longitudinal transport @xcite .",
    "the case of biased diffusion in the presence of a driving force has also received considerable attention due to its relevance to separation devices .",
    "hnggi and coworkers examined the validity of a direct extension of the fick - jacobs equation to describe the biased motion of a brownian particle in a narrow channel of varying cross section .",
    "the authors showed that using an ad - hoc position - dependent diffusivity provides a good approximation , for pclet numbers below a critical value @xcite .",
    "dorfman and coworkers @xcite also investigated the biased motion of a brownian particle in a periodic channel .",
    "specifically , they performed an asymptotic perturbation analysis to obtain simple expressions for the macroscopic transport coefficients that remain valid at relatively large pclet numbers .    here",
    ", we also consider the transport of brownian particles confined to a channel of periodically varying cross section but , in the present case , the confinement is induced by a potential energy landscape and not the solid boundaries of a channel .",
    "this type of spatial confinement occurs , for example , in the transport of suspended particles in microfluidic channels .",
    "depending on the density of the particles , the van der waals and electrostatic forces between the particle and the channel walls , and the chemical composition of the media , the particles could become confined to the secondary minima of the particle - wall interaction potential in the vertical direction @xcite . in that case",
    ", the presence of a periodic pattern on the bottom wall , such as that created by the deposition of thin metal stripes perpendicular to the flow , would lead to the confinement of the brownian particles to a periodically varying channel parallel to the wall , analogous to the one considered here .",
    "we shall show that the effect on the average velocity of the particles ( and the probability distribution in general ) induced by this type of _ soft _ confinement of the suspended particles to an energy minima is the same as that caused by geometric confinement between solid walls .",
    "understanding the effect that this type of confinement has on the transport of suspended particles is particularly important for the development of recently proposed separation techniques in microfluidic devices that are based on partitioning @xcite .",
    "let us consider the transport of brownian particles in a potential that is periodic in the @xmath0-direction , @xmath1 , and that confines the particles in the @xmath2-direction , that is @xmath3 for @xmath4 . in the limit of negligible inertia effects the motion of the particles",

    "we can then write the governing equation and boundary conditions using the following dimensionless variables , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath24 is the absolute temperature , and the re - scaled probability density @xmath25 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity all bars are dropped after nondimensionalization . the governing equation for the reduced probability ( eq .",

    "simple inspection of this equation shows that the leading order approximation for @xmath19 is the local equilibrium in @xmath2 , which corresponds to @xmath28 , due to the no - flux far - field condition . in general",
    ", an accurate description of the long - time transport of brownian particles can be obtained from the first two moments of the asymptotic probability , which describe the average velocity and the broadening of the distribution .",

    "in fact , replacing @xmath49 by @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : b0 ] ) we obtain eq . ( 25 ) in ref .",
    "this suggests that the confining potential @xmath51 has similar effects on the transport of brownian particles to those induced by a channel with solid walls .    before we proceed to solve the equation for @xmath41 it is also interesting to compare it with the equation obtained from the direct extension of the fick - jacobs approximation in the presence of an external force .",
    "in fact , in the narrow geometry that we are considering here , we can assume that the particle will reach local equilibrium in the cross section fairly rapid compared to its diffusive or convective motion along the channel .",
    "this separation of time scales suggests that the conditional probability @xmath52 could be approximated by the equilibrium distribution @xmath53 .",
    "then , the total probability density takes the form , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the marginal probability distribution , @xmath56 considering the long time limit , we can then use the same approximation for the asymptotic distribution , @xmath57 finally , we can project the problem into the longitudinal direction by substituting this expression into the governing equation for the probability density and integrating over the cross - section , @xmath58i(x)\\right\\}=0 .",

    "then , the validity of the ad - hoc position - dependent effective diffusivity proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite could , in principle , be tested by extending the present approach to higher orders in the slenderness parameter .",
    "we now go back to equation ( [ eqn : b0 ] ) to obtain the general solution for @xmath41 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the constants of integration .",
    "the leading order contributions to the average velocity and the dispersion coefficient can then be calculated from the probability distribution .",

    "in this section , we discuss a specific example of the confining potential that illustrates our previous results and allows direct comparison with numerical results . consider the transport of brownian particles confined to a narrow channel by a parabolic potential of periodically varying width , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the position of the center of the channel , which we assume to be constant ( straight centerline ) , and @xmath73 determines the minimum opening of the channel .",
    "the slenderness of the geometry is given by @xmath74 , which is the ratio of the characteristic width of the potential in the @xmath2-direction , @xmath18 , to the length of one period , @xmath75 .",
    "using the same dimensionless variables introduced before and dropping again all bars for the sake of simplicity , we obtain , @xmath76 where @xmath77 it is clear then that the particles will be confined in the @xmath2 direction by a parabolic potential and that the width of the confining region is determined by @xmath78 .",

    "therefore , the diffusive fluxes are negligible compared to convective transport , and the average velocity tends to its bulk value , something that is also clear from eq .",
