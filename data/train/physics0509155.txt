    "it is well established that knowledge of the scattering length of a pair of colliding atoms is important in the interpretation of observations of the behaviour of cold trapped ensembles of such atoms @xcite . scattering lengths are usually calculated by solving the single - channel radial schrdinger equation to find the phase shifts for several small values of the wavenumber of relative motion and extrapolating from effective range expansions @xcite , or by solving the zero - energy schrdinger equation and evaluating quadratures @xcite .    the schrdinger equation is a second order differential equation . we shall show another method of evaluating the scattering length in which we solve the first order equation , a riccati equation , of the variable phase approach to potential scattering @xcite .",
    "solving the equation is not simple and we shall suggest and illustrate two methods that circumvent the inherent difficulties . a differential equation can be obtained for the effective range @xcite but it is not amenable to numerical solution .    in obtaining the scattering length from the solution of the schrdinger or riccati equation , we must obtain solutions at infinite values of the interatomic separation , @xmath0 . in practice",
    "we stop the solution at some value @xmath1 , but @xmath1 must be chosen very large , and such choices increase computation time and accumulated error .",
    "we shall show how the riccati equation can be used to predict corrections , to be applied to the _ calculated _ scattering length , that compensate for stopping the calculation at finite distance @xmath1 ; such corrections enable us to make calculations with smaller values of @xmath1 while maintaining desired accuracy @xcite .",
    "the solution of a low energy schrdinger equation may be corrected for the influence of a long range interaction at separations exceeding @xmath1 by perturbation theory .",
    "however the perturbation expansion is made in terms of the ratio of the potential energy to the kinetic energy and becomes invalid as the energy of the collision is reduced ( as is necessary in the usual methods to obtain a scattering length ) .",
    "this problem may be avoided by use of secular perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss our predicted corrections in the light of secular perturbation theory and also compare them with correction formulae that have been obtained elsewhere @xcite .",
