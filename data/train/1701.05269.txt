    "galaxy scaling law relations of mass , rotational velocity and radial size reveal the laws which govern the structure and dynamics of disk galaxies .",

    "the fit of the tfr has been continuously improved by the availability of large surveys and improved distance measures .",
    "the scatter of the tfr is significantly smaller in the ( nir ) band than in the uv or fir bands and because near infrared luminosity is the best measure of stellar mass this suggests that the tfr is primarily a relation between mass and rotational velocity .",
    "accordingly , the btfr @xcite correlates total baryonic mass including both the stellar and gas mass to @xmath3 , the ` flat ' rotational velocity measured in the outer  regions of disk galaxies resulting in a tight relationship over a range of many decades of mass .",
    "because of it s fundamental importance , the tfr has been the subject of many evaluations over a period of 40 years . @xcite and @xcite provide usedful background and @xcite was one the first to study the uncertainties of the i - band tfr which are significantly smaller than in other wavelengths . @xcite includes a definitive study of the random and systematic errors of the tfr calibration performed as part of the hubble key project .",
    "@xcite is a recent review of the reliability of the various methods used to measure galaxy mass .",
    "the relations of mass , radius and velocity other than the tfr receive less attention but are equally important in helping us to uncover the underlying physical processes .",
    "@xcite presents correlations among the parameters of luminosity , velocity and size equivalent to those given here but with much larger scatter .",
    "@xcite makes several findings related to the source of errors in the measurements finding , in particular , that using an isophotal radius rather than a scale length reduced the scatter of the r - l relation by a factor of about 3 so that an isophotal radius is the more reliable measure .",
    "the interpretation of scaling laws is tied to the dark matter paradigm which underpins the accepted @xmath4   cosmology .",
    "@xcite is a current review of the subject and @xcite is a history which gives invaluable background .",
    "the original puzzle was that the velocity of the stellar disk is often flat from the innermost regions to the edge of the optically observed disk and this was taken to mean prima facie that a dark matter halo is required to explain the kinematics .",
    "however @xcite , @xcite and others showed that the combination of a central bulge surrounded by a truncated exponential disk results in a flat velocity curve with a reasonable stellar mass - to - light ratio and this finding is consistent with analytical results of newtonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "maximum disk disk models ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) find that little or no dark matter is required to explain the rotation curve in the inner regions of disk galaxies(i.e .",
    "the first few scale lengths ) although others ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that dark matter is dominant at all radii .",
    "some investigators force the result by adjusting the @xmath5  ratio so that the contribution from baryons is small enough to ` leave room ' for an isothermal dark halo .",
    "a purely exponential disk has @xmath6 at 2.2 scale lengths and most optical rotation curves did not extent out much beyond that radius .",
    "it is necessary to measure the rotation curve beyond about 3 scale lengths ( which contains 90% of the disk light ) to observe ` flat ' rotation curves .",
    "observations of neutral hydrogen extending well beyond the optical radii of galaxies proved beyond doubt that the rotation curves of the outer regions of spiral galaxies can not be explained by the observed matter ( e.g. : * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    here",
    "i show that the dynamics of the inner stellar disk can be explained by newtonian physics without room for a dominant amount of dark matter .",
    "this conclusion is robust because the uncertainties involved in the present calculation of average quantities are significantly smaller than those associated with previous evaluations .",
    "i use the parameter @xmath7  which is the most meaningful measure of stellar disk size for the study of the dynamics .",
    "@xmath7  is the radius at which the collapsed surface density , @xmath5 , is small enough that it does not contribute significantly to the gravitational field .",
    "the average mass density of a the stellar disk is typically about 75 @xmath8/@xmath9and i take @xmath7  to be the radius at which @xmath5  decreases to below about 5% of this value .",
    "power - law scaling relations define planes in log space .",
    "elementary geometry requires that if a set of galaxies lie on each of two planes then all of the galaxies must lie on the line at the intersection of the planes and , indeed , several observers have pointed out that the scaling relations of disk galaxies seem to have only one degree of freedom .",
    "any of the planes formed by rotation around the line of intersection also define power law relations which are as valid as any other .",
    "any two relations of the three variables are sufficient to define the line of intersection and with this simple geometric insight i identified the physically meaningful relationships which define the line of intersection .",
    "the equalities which govern the relationships of total baryonic mass , rotational velocity and disk radius are : @xmath10 where @xmath11  is the total baryonic mass and is the sum of @xmath12 , the stellar mass , and @xmath13 , the gas mass ; @xmath14  is the the gravitational constant ; @xmath7  is the radius of the stellar disk ; @xmath15  is the circular velocity measured at @xmath7 ; and @xmath16  and @xmath17  are constants which have physical interpretations .",
    "algebraic manipulation of equations [ equ : govern ] produces the mass - radius - velocity relation , the radius - velocity relation , the mass - radius relation and the mass - velocity relation as given in table [ tbl : fundrel ] .    in what follows",
    "i use a well - characterized data base to find the constants @xmath16  and @xmath17  and show that these two constants alone determine the four scaling relations with no need for any other free parameters .",

    "it could be argued that the observed size of the stellar disk is determined by measurement sensitivity and harassment by companions rather than being a fundamental property of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite studied 23 edge - on spiral galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey and the stsci digital sky survey and found that the majority of the galaxies show clear evidence for complete truncation , consistent with previous findings in other samples . in many cases ,",
    "the truncation radius was associated with a drop in rotational velocity and with large  warps , starting at about 1.1 truncation radii .",
    "these truncations were predicted by @xcite who showed that a truncated exponential disk could reproduce the rotation curves of most disk galaxies .",
    "various studies of inclined galaxies have not confirmed the complete truncations seen for edge - on galaxies .",
    "instead , the stellar mass distribution follows a smooth exponential to a breakpoint where : 1 ) some galaxies continued exponentially with the same scale factor ; 2 ) some(called truncated ) continue but with a smaller scale factor ; and 3 ) some(called anti - truncated ) continue but with a larger scale factor ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
