    "the ant nebula , mz  3 is a young bipolar planetary nebula ( pn ) that consists of a bright core , two spherical bipolar lobes and two outer large filamentary nebulosities . in recent years , it has been extensively studied .",
    "there is evidence suggesting that mz  3 is not a normal pn but contains a symbiotic pair at the center ( schmeja & kimeswenger 2001 ) .",
    "zhang & liu ( 2002 ) find that the dense nebular gas at the center may have a different origin from that in the extended lobes , and suggest that mz  3 consists of a giant companion that gives rise to the central dense gas and a white dwarf that provides the ionizing photons . in the current study",
    ", we provide further supporting evidence for this scenario by determining the fe / ni abundance ratio in mz  3 .",
    "our observations have been described by zhang & liu ( 2002 ) .",
    "the slit was oriented approximately along the nebular major axis and through the central star .",
    "we divided the nebula into two regions .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , [ fe  ii ] and [ ni  ii ] lines have been clearly observed from the central region , but are absent in the lobes , indicating a possible difference in chemical composition between the two regions .    using the current available atomic data , we have constructed multilevel atomic models for fe@xmath0 ( 159 levels ) and ni@xmath0 ( 76 levels ) , which were used to obtain the fe@xmath0/h@xmath0 and ni@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratios . for our calculations ,",
    "continuum fluorescent excitation of [ fe  ii ] and [ ni  ii ] lines was also considered based on the method of lucy ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , we found that fluorescent excitation is not important in this pn given its low - excitation ( @xmath1k ) and high density at the center ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) .",
    "as shown in table  1 , the derived fe@xmath0/h@xmath0 and ni@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratios are almost independent of the dilution factor of continuum radiation , @xmath4 .",
    "given that fe and ni have similar ionization potentials , we assume @xmath5 in deriving the fe / ni abundance ratios .    .fe",
    "/ ni ratio for the central emission region of mz  3 [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the solar fe / ni ratio is 18 ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "iron serves as the dominant seed of @xmath6-process which occurs during the agb phase . according to the agb evolutionary models , iron in the envelop",
    "is diluted as material is dredged up to the surface from the he innershell ( the third dredge - up ) .",
    "therefore , fe / ni ratio is expected to decrease after the thermally pulsating agb phase .",
    "fe and ni have similar condensation temperatures , thus the amounts of depletion onto dust grains , if any , should be comparable . therefore , fe / ni ratio in a pn should be lower than the solar value . from the deep spectra presented by sharpee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we obtain an fe / ni ratio of 4.8 for pn ic  418 , significantly lower than the solar value , consistent with the predictions of the agb models .",
    "however , no significant depletion of the fe / ni ratio is detected for the central dense emission region of mz  3 , as shown in table  1 , suggesting that the gas arises from winds of a giant companion where the @xmath6-process has not occurred yet .",
    "our results show an enhancement of the fe / ni ratio relative to the solar value and we attribute this to a slightly higher depletion of ni relative to fe ."
