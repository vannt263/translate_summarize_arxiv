    "high - precision calculations in quantum field theory require the evaluation of feynman amplitudes , which represent quantum corrections in a perturbative expansion .",
    "this expansion is governed by a small parameter , the fine - structure constant , and related to the number of loops in the associated feynman diagrams .",
    "these are graphical devices to aid in the book - keeping",
    ".    the evaluation of such feynman amplitudes can technically be rather difficult , and one must often resort to approximate methods , valid in certain kinematical limits . for the case of electron - positron scattering ,",
    "the full second - order corrections are not yet known . however , in the limit of high energies and small scattering angles , the problem simplifies : the relevant part of the so - called virtual amplitude can be expanded in powers of large logarithms .",
    "the coefficients and arguments of these logarithms can be extracted by the use of suitable mellin transforms .",
    "we shall here review some of the techniques involved , and present some of the mathematical results of such calculations .",
    "the mathematical results we will discuss , derive from the `` two - loop '' feynman diagram depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the solid lines represent an electron and a positron scattering via the exchange of photons ( wiggly lines ) .",
    "[ fig : double - box ]    ( 3.5,3.5 ) ( -3,0.0 )    the momenta @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 only enter through the combinations @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent squares of the over - all energy and momentum transfer , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 is the electron mass .",
    "the corresponding feynman amplitude is proportional to the integral @xmath13 ^ 3}\\ ] ] where a fictitious photon mass , @xmath14 , has been introduced in order to make the integrand well - defined for all @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are homogeneous functions of seven @xmath15 , one associated with each internal line in the diagram .",
    "asymptotically , for @xmath18 ( high energies , small angles ) , the integral @xmath19 has the structure @xmath20 where the arguments of the logarithms are given by the kinematical variables @xmath10 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in order to extract , from the integral ( [ eq : feynman ] ) , the asymptotic behaviour given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymptotic ] ) , we perform a mellin transform .",
    "if the function @xmath24 behaves `` almost '' like @xmath25 at large @xmath26 , then we define the mellin transform as @xmath27 the fact that @xmath28 is only marginally integrable , is represented by poles in @xmath29 , as @xmath30 .",

    "one will need two preliminary results .",
    "the first one is @xmath39 _ proof : _ first , change variables by putting @xmath40 . using the integral representation of the gamma function , we find , @xmath41 which is valid if @xmath42 is purely imaginary with @xmath43 and re @xmath44 .",
    "this result can be extended to any @xmath42 with i m @xmath45 by analytic continuation .",

    "+ _ proof of the factorization formula : _",
    "@xmath53 from which the factorization formula follows .",
    "the formula is valid for i m @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
