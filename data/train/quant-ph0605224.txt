    "bit commitment is a cryptographic primitive involving two mistrustful parties , conventionally called alice and bob .",
    "alice is supposed to submit an encoded bit of information to bob in such a way that bob has ( almost ) no chance to identify the bit before alice later decodes it for him , whereas alice has ( almost ) no way of changing the value of the bit once she has submitted it : in technical terms , a good bit commitment protocol should be simultaneously _ concealing _ and _",
    "binding_.    bit commitment has immediate practical applications , and is also known to be a very powerful cryptographic primitive .",
    "it was conceived by blum @xcite as a building block for secure coin tossing .",
    "bit commitment also allows to implement secure oblivious transfer @xcite , which in turn is sufficient to establish secure two - party computation @xcite .    a standard example to illustrate bit commitment is for alice to write the bit down on a piece of paper , which",
    "is then locked in a safe and sent to bob , whereas alice keeps the key . at a later time",
    ", she will unveil by handing over the key to bob .",
    "however , bob has a well - equipped toolbox at home and may have been able to open the safe in the meantime .",
    "so while this scheme may offer reasonably good practical security , it is in principle insecure .",
    "yet all bit commitment schemes that have wide currency today rely on such technological constraints : not on strongboxes and keys , but on unproven assumptions that certain computations are hard to perform .",
    "several such protocols have been suggested , either computationally binding @xcite or computationally concealing @xcite .",
    "cryptographers have long known that without such technological constraints , bit commitment ( like any other interesting two - party cryptographic primitive ) can not be securely implemented in a classical world @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been a long - time challenge for quantum cryptographers to find _ unconditionally secure _ quantum bit commitment protocols , in which  very much in parallel to quantum key distribution @xcite  security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum physics alone .      the first quantum bit commitment protocol is due to bennett and brassard and appears in their famous 1984 quantum cryptography paper @xcite , in a version adapted to coin tossing . in their scheme , alice commits to a bit value by preparing a sequence of photons in either of two mutually unbiased bases , in a way that the resulting quantum states are indistinguishable to bob .",
    "the authors show that their protocol is secure against so - called _ passive cheating _ , in which alice initially commits to the bit value @xmath0 , and then tries to unveil @xmath1 later .",
    "however , they also prove that alice can cheat with a more sophisticated strategy , in which she initially prepares pairs of maximally entangled states instead , keeps one particle of each pair in her lab and sends the second particle to bob .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the epr effect that alice can then unveil either bit at the opening stage by measuring her particles in the appropriate basis , and bob has no way to detect the difference .",
    "subsequent proposals for bit commitment schemes tried to evade this type of attack by forcing the players to carry out measurements and communicate classically as they go through the protocol . at a 1993 conference brassard ,",
    "crpeau , jozsa , and langlois presented a bit commitment protocol @xcite that was claimed and generally accepted to be unconditionally secure .    in 1996 it was then realized by lo and chau @xcite , and independently by mayers @xcite that all previously proposed bit commitment protocols are vulnerable to a generalized version of the epr attack that renders the bb84 proposal insecure , a result they slightly extended to cover quantum bit commitment protocols in general .",
    "in essence , their proof goes as follows : at the end of the commitment phase , bob will hold one out of two quantum states @xmath2 as proof of alice s commitment to the bit value @xmath3 .",
    "alice holds its purification @xmath4 , which she will later pass on to bob to unveil . for the protocol to",
    "be concealing , the two states @xmath2 should be ( almost ) indistinguishable , @xmath5 .",
    "but uhlmann s theorem @xcite then implies the existence of a unitary transformation @xmath6 that ( nearly ) rotates the purification of @xmath7 into the purification of @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath6 is localized on the purifying system only , which is entirely under alice s control , lo - chau - mayers argue that alice can switch at will back and forth between the two states , and is not in any way bound to her commitment . as a consequence",
    ", any concealing bit commitment protocol is argued to be necessarily non - binding .",
    "these results still hold true when both players are restricted by superselection rules @xcite .",
    "so while the proposed quantum bit commitment protocols offer good practical security on the grounds that alice s epr attack is hard to perform with current technology , none of them is unconditionally secure .",
    "spekkens and rudolph @xcite extended the no - go theorem by providing explicit bounds on the degree of concealment and bindingness that can be achieved simultaneously in any bit commitment protocol , some of which they showed can be saturated .      in view of these negative results ,",
    "subsequent research has primarily focused on bit commitment under plausible technological constraints , such as a limited classical @xcite or quantum @xcite memory , or the difficulty of performing collective measurements @xcite .",
    "in an alternative approach , researchers have slightly modified the standard setting to evade the no - go theorem : kent @xcite has shown that relativistic signalling constraints may facilitate secure bit commitment when alice and bob each run two labs a ( large ) distance apart and security is maintained through a continual exchange of messages .",
    "a different variant was introduced by hardy and kent @xcite , and independently by aharonov _",
    "_ @xcite : in _ cheat - sensitive _ bit commitment protocols , both players may have the chance to cheat , but face the risk of their fraud being detected by the adversary .",
    "building on kent s original proposal @xcite , the tradeoff between bindingness and concealment in quantum _ string _ commitment protocols has recently been investigated @xcite .    at the same time , the lo - chau - mayers no - go theorem @xcite is continually being challenged .",
    "yuen and others have repeatedly expressed doubts in mayer s opaque paper @xcite , arguing that the no - go proof is not general enough to exclude all conceivable quantum bit commitment protocols .",
    "several protocols have been proposed and claimed to circumvent the no - go theorem ( see @xcite and references therein , as well as this account @xcite of the controversy ) .",
    "these protocols seek to strengthen bob s position with the help of ` secret parameters ' or ` anonymous states ' , so that alice lacks some information to cheat successfully : while uhlmann s theorem would still imply the existence of a unitary cheating transformation as described above , this transformation might be unknown to alice .",
    "two camps seem to have formed , a large one comprising most of the community , in which the impossibility of quantum bit commitment is accepted on the basis of the lo - chau - mayers proof , and a smaller group of sceptics , which is not convinced , even though no provably secure protocol , and hence a counterexample to the no - go result , has surfaced so far .",
    "it appears that much of this controversy stems from slightly differing approaches to the problem .",
    "a good way to pinpoint the basic disagreement is kerckhoffs principle , which goes back to the 19th century military cryptographer auguste kerckhoffs and is now universally embraced by cryptographers @xcite .",
    "the principle states that the security of a cryptographic protocol should not rely on keeping parts of the algorithm secret . in the words of bruce schneier ,",
    "`` every secret creates a potential failure point .",
    "secrecy , in other words , is a prime cause of brittleness  and therefore something likely to make a system prone to catastrophic collapse '' @xcite . in this respect",
    "every secret parameter chosen by the human in a cryptographic protocol  e.  g. a password  is regarded as a potential weakness . for this reason cryptographers usually think of their algorithms as being executed by machines , whose",
    "blueprints can be published without jeopardizing the security of the system .",
    "anonymous states and other secret parameters used in yuen s protocols are apparently regarded as a violation of kerckhoffs principle , which suggests a restriction to fixed and automatizable strategies for both players .",
    "deviations from these strategies are considered an attempted fraud .",
    "the kerckhoffian security analysis then does not hold any provisions for the case in which _ both _ parties deviate from their ` honest ' strategies .",
    "therefore lo - chau - mayers only consider the final committed state given that bob sticks to his publicly known strategy , since alice s cheat only has to work against this strategy .",
    "so while kerckhoffs principle is certainly high on the list of desiderata for cryptographic protocols , it appears that lo - chau - mayers only show that there is no bit commitment protocol _ satisfying kerckhoffs principle _ , whereas the next best thing , e.g. , an anonymous state protocol might still exist .",
    "another possible origin for disagreement is the style of mayers s paper @xcite , along the lines of mark kac s dictum `` a demonstration convinces a reasonable man ; a proof convinces a stubborn man '' . in this sense ,",
    "i.e. , according to the standards of `` stubborn '' mathematics or mathematical physics , mayers gives merely a demonstration .",
    "since the argument against kerckhoffian protocols only involves the state directly after commitment , mayers declares it irrelevant to formalize the class of two - party protocols , even though an insufficiently specified domain usually leaves a no - go `` theorem '' rather fuzzy .",
    "other aspects of the problem ( e.g. the use of classical and quantum information together ) get a similarly rough treatment .",
    "this may be a symptom of the `` four page pest '' . in any case",
    ", it appeared to us high time to convince ourselves , and hopefully some other stubborn men , of the exact scope and status of the no bit commitment statements .      in this contribution",
    "we propose to resolve the bit commitment controversy with a strengthened no - go theorem .",
    "we will give a precise description of general two - party protocols , which we hope no longer shows the hard work of keeping it fully explicit but still notationally manageable .",
    "this description should also be helpful for analyzing protocols for other tasks , involving any number of parties .",
    "our description of bit commitment does not assume kerckhoffs principle , so that bob is not honor bound to a particular course of action .",
    "nevertheless , we show that any concealing protocol allows alice a universal cheating strategy , working against all strategies of bob simultaneously",
    ". moreover , our result is stable against small errors , in the sense that nearly concealing protocols allow a nearly perfect cheat , with explicit universal error bounds .",
    "the result is based on a continuity theorem for stinespring s representation @xcite , which generalizes uhlmann s theorem from quantum states to channels .",
    "our proof includes a full treatment of classical and quantum information flow and also covers aborts and resets .",
    "it applies to bit commitment protocols with any ( finite or infinite ) number of rounds during each the commitment , holding , and opening phase .",
    "we only require that the expected number of rounds is finite . moreover , the proof is not restricted to quantum systems on finite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "the strengthened no - go theorem shows the insecurity of all recently proposed bit commitment protocols @xcite .",
    "a preliminary version of the proof , restricted to single - round commitments , has appeared in @xcite .",
    "our results generalize that of ozawa @xcite and recent work by cheung @xcite , who showed that alice can still cheat in protocols with secret parameters for the simpler case of perfect concealment , and without a full reduction .",
    "cheung s estimates @xcite for approximately concealing protocols depend on the dimensions of the underlying hilbert space , and hence can not rule out bit commitment protocols with high - dimensional or infinite - dimensional systems .    we also classify those protocols that fall outside the standard setting , and thus may allow secure bit commitment .",
    "we propose a new such bit commitment protocol whose security  perhaps paradoxically  relies on decoherence in bob s lab .",
    "interestingly , this protocol explores a purely quantum - mechanical effect : the distinction between the local erasure of information and the destruction of quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "well - known classical bit commitment protocols whose security relies on noisy communication channels are briefly reviewed , too .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : setup ] we give a detailed description of the setup for quantum bit commitment protocols , and list important types of protocols that fall within our definition .",
    "this will serve to specify the domain for the proof of the strengthened no - go theorem , which is then presented in section  [ sec : proof ] . in section  [ sec : energy ]",
    "we briefly describe how to extend the no - go theorem to quantum bit commitment protocols in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces or with infinitely many rounds .",
    "section  [ sec : decoherence ] investigates provably secure bit commitment protocols whose security is built on decoherence in either alice s or bob s lab , or in the transmission line .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "an appendix contains the necessary background on quantum states and channels , direct sums and quantum - classical hybrid systems .",
    "in this section we describe the task of quantum bit commitment , and define what a successful bit commitment protocol would have to achieve .",
    "we have attempted not to exclude any possibilities , and have avoided all simplifications `` without loss of generality '' at this stage . in this way",
    "we hope to separate , more clearly than our predecessors , the definition of bit commitment to which the statement `` bit commitment is impossible '' refers and , on the other hand , the simplifications which we will make in the course of the proof of this statement .",
    "the analysis will be based solely on the principles of quantum mechanics , including classical physics .",
    "we do not consider relativistic signalling constraints , which are known to facilitate secure bit commitment @xcite .",
    "for ease of presentation , we initially impose as a _ finiteness condition _",
    ", that all classical messages can only take finitely many values , that all quantum systems can be described in a finite dimensional hilbert space , and that the total number of messages exchanged is uniformly bounded . these constraints",
    "will then be relaxed in sec .",

    "* the basic task  * bit commitment is a cryptographic primitive involving two mistrustful parties , conventionally called alice and bob .",
    "alice is supposed to submit an encoded bit of information to bob in such a way that bob has ( almost ) no chance to identify the bit before alice decodes it for him , and alice has ( almost ) no way of changing the value of the bit after she has submitted it . in other words ,",
    "bob is interested in _ binding _ alice to some commitment , whereas alice would like to _ conceal _ her commitment from bob .",
    "* protocols and strategies  *",
    "a _ protocol _ first of all regulates the exchange of messages between alice and bob , such that at every stage it is clear what type of message is expected from the participants , although , of course , their content is not fixed .",
    "the expected message types can be either classical or quantum or a combination thereof , with the number of distinguishable classical signals and the dimension of the hilbert spaces fixed .",
    "the type of messages can depend on classical information generated previously .",
    "the collection of all these instructions will be called the _ communication interface _ of the protocol .    a particular plan for operating a local laboratory to supply the required messages ,",
    "is called a _ strategy_.",
    "a strategy could determine that some message sent is obtained from a measurement on a system available in the local lab , but it could also specify the arbitrary invention of a classical value to be sent and the fresh preparation of an accompanying quantum system .",
    "we typically denote alice s strategy by @xmath9 and bob s by @xmath10 .",
    "the second key element of the protocol specifies definite procedures for alice to follow if she wants to commit the bit values @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "these special _ honest strategies _ will be denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "* phases of the protocol  * in any commitment scheme , we can distinguish three phases .",
    "the first is the _ commitment phase _ , in which alice and bob start from some ( publicly known and trusted ) shared quantum or classical state and go through a possibly complicated exchange of classical and quantum messages . by definition , at the end of this phase , the bit value is considered to be committed to bob but , supposedly , concealed from him .",
    "alice and bob then might split up for a while , without further communication . in this",
    "_ holding phase _ typically only local operations are possible , i.e. , bob might attempt to read the committed bit , and alice might attempt to prepare a cheat .    finally they get in touch again to open the commitment . in the _ opening phase _ , alice sends to bob some classical or quantum information to reveal her commitment . taking both alice s message and his own ( classical and quantum ) records , bob",
    "will then perform a suitable _ verification measurement_. his measurement will result in either the bit value @xmath3 , indicating a successful commitment , or in a failure symbol `` not ok '' , indicating an attempted cheat or abort .",
    "a typical opening consists in alice sending to bob the value of the bit she claims to have committed , together will all the classical or quantum information needed for bob to check this claim against his records .",
    "the protocol might also be ended in a _",
    "public opening _ , which requires alice and bob to meet , bringing with them all quantum and classical systems in their possession , explaining what strategies they were using , and allowing bob to choose arbitrary measurements on all these systems to verify , with alice staying on to watch .",
    "that is , no possibility of cheating , withholding information , or making false claims about the outcome of verification exists in a public opening .    * conditions on successful protocols  * we assume that alice s strategies @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be distinguished with high probability by bob s verification measurement : if alice honestly played @xmath15 , then bob s measurement will result in the bit value @xmath0 with probability @xmath16 for some ( small ) @xmath17 .",
    "we call such a protocol _",
    "@xmath18-verifiable _ , or _ @xmath18-sound_.",
    "since this condition depends only on the honest strategies , it is very easy to satisfy .",
    "we call a protocol @xmath19-_concealing _ , if alice s honest strategies can not be distinguished by bob ( up to an error @xmath19 ) before she opens the commitment . in general",
    ", of course , the probabilities he measures while applying his protocol @xmath10 depend on whether alice chooses @xmath13 or @xmath14 . here",
    "we require that no matter what strategy @xmath10 bob uses and no matter what measurement he makes , these probabilities never differ by more than @xmath19 throughout the commitment and holding phase .",
    "note that the concealing condition makes no statement whatsoever about other strategies of alice .",
    "if alice cheats , there is usually nothing to be concealed anyway .",
    "a @xmath20-_cheating strategy _ for alice is a pair of strategies @xmath21 and @xmath22 such that bob can not distinguish @xmath13 from @xmath21 , and @xmath14 from @xmath22 better than with a probability difference @xmath20 , at any time , including the opening phase .",
    "of course , these conditions would be trivially satisfied for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "what makes @xmath25 cheating strategies is that alice does not actually make the decision about the value of the bit until after the commitment phase .",
    "that is , the strategies @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be the same throughout the commitment phase , and can only differ by local operations carried out in the holding or opening phase .",
    "note , however , that alice might have to decide from the outset that she wants to cheat , since the strategies @xmath26 might be quite different from both @xmath13 and @xmath14 . fig .",

    "alice s basic strategic choices .",
    "decisions she must take are indicated by diamonds , some actions necessary for a typical cheating strategy by squares . the cheating strategies @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identical throughout the commitment phase , and might be equal to a purification of the honest strategy @xmath13",
    ". then @xmath6 indicates a unitary cheating transformation , and @xmath27 the introduction of suitable decoherence to reverse purification . in the opening phase",
    "the cheating strategies are identical to their honest counterparts .",
    "_ ]    the condition we impose here is much stronger than the condition that bob s standard verification measurements are fooled by the cheat ( perhaps with a bound on the success probability ) : we require that no measurement whatsoever could detect a difference . with a public opening rule",
    "one could even say that after the cheat not even alice herself could help bob to tell the difference .",
    "clearly , these conditions make it very hard for alice to cheat .",
    "therefore , our proof that alice can still cheat under such conditions automatically includes all protocols with weaker conditions on successful cheats .    * real time checks for cheating ",
    "* it is perhaps helpful to point out the difference between two kinds of checks on alice s honesty , which bob might perform .",
    "we have granted him unlimited technological power in the definition of @xmath19-concealing .",
    "but for running the protocol no such fantastic abilities are required , and he will not actually do all those complicated tests .",
    "in fact , the concealing and binding properties of the protocol can not be ascertained by any practical tests , but are there to be checked theoretically by alice and bob on the basis of the publicly available description of the protocol .",
    "it is on the basis of such considerations that alice and bob will consent to use the protocol in the first place .    during a single run of the protocol",
    ", bob can employ some tests on alice s behavior as part of the protocol .",
    "if bob suspects a problem he may be entitled to calling an abort of the protocol ( clearly a classical message ) , and the procedure would start at the beginning . the total number of such resets must be limited on the grounds of bounding alice s probability of cheating .",
    "the possibility of such checks at run - time is the main reason why we must consider protocols with a large number of rounds , possibly differing from run to run .",

    "if she then opts for the bit value @xmath31 instead , she will apply a unitary operation @xmath6 on the purifying system , and thenceforth follow the honest strategy @xmath32 .      in this section",
    "we will cast the above description more explicitly into the formalism of quantum theory .",
    "thereby we further reduce possible ambiguities in the statement of the problem , but also prepare the notation for the proof .    the basic formalism of quantum theory is briefly reviewed in the appendix .",
    "we will generally identify systems by their observable algebras .",
    "this has the advantage that combinations of classical and quantum information are naturally covered : a quantum system with hilbert space @xmath33 is then represented by the algebra @xmath34 of operators on @xmath33 , and a system characterized by a classical parameter @xmath35 , and has hilbert space @xmath36 in that case is described by the direct sum @xmath37 .",
    "a state on such an algebra is of the form @xmath38 , and is specified first by a probability distribution @xmath39 for the @xmath35 s , and second by a collection of density operators @xmath40 on @xmath36 , which are used to compute expectations if the value of the classical parameter is known to be @xmath35 . since this formalism for handling classical information in protocols is not generally familiar , we describe it in some more detail in appendix a and b.    many algebras ( indexed by the nodes of the communication tree ) will appear in the description of the protocol , indicating that with each operation the type of quantum system in the respective lab might change completely . by choosing the lab algebras large enough",
    "this dependence might be avoided . however , even when the lab systems remain the same , it is helpful to keep the distinguishing indices for keeping track of the progress of the protocol .      at every stage of the protocol",
    "a certain amount of shared classical information will have accumulated .",
    "classical information never gets lost , so the stages of the protocol , together with the currently available classical information naturally form the nodes of a tree , which we call the _ communication tree_. an example is depicted in fig .  [",

    "each node @xmath35 is completely characterized by the entire history of the classical messages exchanged between alice and bob , i.e. , we can write @xmath50 .",
    "at every node , we denote the observable algebras of alice s and bob s laboratories by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",

    "the algebras of alice and bob could themselves be direct sums , representing classical information only available to alice and bob , respectively , but we do not look at this for the moment .",
    "now consider some node @xmath35 , and assume that it is alice s turn ( everything holds mutatis mutandis for bob ) .",
    "we know that some message @xmath43 is expected from alice , accompanied by a quantum system with observable algebra @xmath57 .",
    "the most general way of doing this is a quantum operation sending states on @xmath51 to states on @xmath58 . written in the heisenberg picture alice hence chooses a channel ( completely positive normalized map , cf .",
    "appendix ) @xmath59 here we have added a parameter @xmath9 to @xmath60 , to make it clear that choosing these channels for all @xmath35 is precisely what defines alice s strategy .",

    "we will assume that the initial state @xmath76 is known to both alice and bob , and henceforth write @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 , and @xmath79 instead of @xmath72 to streamline the presentation .      in the concealing condition , as well as in the description of cheating strategies , it is important to decide whether bob can distinguish two strategies of alice at commitment time . clearly , this depends only on the restriction @xmath80 of the state @xmath81 to bob s laboratory , which has observable algebra @xmath82 .    the security criterion given in sec .",
    "[ sec : english ] asks for the largest probability difference obtainable by bob .",
    "it is convenient to express this in a trace norm difference : the largest difference of expectations in `` yes - no '' experiments with density matrices @xmath83 is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 ranges over all so - called _ effects _ @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "that is , the largest probability difference is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the trace norm .",
    "this naturally leads us to the following definition of concealing protocols and cheating strategies :    [ def : concealing ] * ( concealing ) * + we say that a protocol with a strategy pair @xmath89 for alice is @xmath19-concealing iff for all strategies @xmath10 of bob @xmath90 when this condition holds with @xmath91 , we say that the protocol is _",
    "perfectly concealing_.    note that one possible measuring strategy for bob is to actually make the measurement at an earlier time , record the result , and send only dummy messages to alice afterwards .",

    "of course , none of them are ultimately successful .",
    "but this is in many cases not obvious from the outset , so these ideas serve well to illustrate the richness of two - party protocols as formalized in our scheme .      as explained in the introduction , the first observation concerning quantum bit commitment",
    "was made in the classic paper of bennett and brassard on quantum cryptography @xcite . in this basic scenario",
    "the commitment phase has only one round , in which alice prepares one of two orthogonal bell states @xmath95 .",
    "these have the same restriction on bob s system , so the protocol is perfectly concealing .",
    "but they are also connected by a unitary on alice s side ( as all maximally entangled states are ) , and this unitary constitutes her _ sneak flip _ cheating strategy , which under these circumstances also works perfectly .",
    "the natural generalization of this protocol is to replace the bell states by arbitrary pure states generated by alice @xcite .",
    "when these have the same restriction on bob s side , they are purifications of the same state , and hence connected by a partial isometry on alice s side , which serves as a sneak flip operation .",
    "a crucial step is now to go away from perfect concealment ( @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : setup02 ] ) ) , which seems to have been considered first in @xcite . in this case one has to use a continuity result for purifications , i.e. , that nearby states have nearby purifications .",
    "in other words , one needs an estimate @xcite of uhlmann s fidelity ( which measures the distance between purifying vectors ) , and the trace norm .",
    "classical communication occurs naturally in cryptographic protocols , so it needs to be included in the analysis .",
    "in contrast to some of our predecessors , who choose a purely quantum description from the outset , we treat classical information explicitly throughout . in particular ,",
    "classical information in the lo - chau - mayers approach is treated quantum - mechanically and sent over noiseless quantum channels , while our description explicitly allows information transfer over classical channels , and thus provides a natural setting to include purely classical protocols in the analysis .",
    "cheating becomes harder for alice if the protocol requires some exchange of classical information , for she no longer has full control over the purification spaces of the two commitment states .",
    "roughly speaking , unitaries which introduce superpositions of states , which belong to different classical values already sent to bob , are forbidden . in the formalism introduced above this",
    "means that alice has to find a cheating unitary for every classical communication history @xmath35 .",
    "mayers heuristic paper @xcite has some provisions for this case , by sending classical values to a special quantum repository in the environment , and effectively coherentifying all classical information . in contrast , in this text the classical communication flow is treated explicitly , and in fact emerges naturally as a framework for the description of the protocol .",
    "this approach should also prove helpful in the analysis of other cryptographic tasks .",
    "the protocols so far were characterized by the property that bob really had no strategic choices to make during the commitment phase .",
    "hence the state at the end of the commitment phase , written in our scheme as @xmath96 , really does not depend on bob s strategy @xmath10 .",
    "so alice only has to connect the purifications of two states which are explicitly known to her .",
    "clearly , her task of finding a clever sneak flip becomes harder if there is a proper dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "lo - chau - mayers restrict their analysis to those protocols in which bob follows a specified ` honest ' strategy @xmath97 , which is assumed to be publicly known in accordance with kerckhoffs principle . in these cases",
    ", alice knows how to cheat , and the no - go result immediately applies .    as explained in the introduction",
    ", we do not require that bob follows such a publicly known standard strategy .",
    "alice then indeed has to find a sneak flip working for all of bob s admissible strategies @xmath10 .",
    "the easiest such protocol begins with bob sending a system to alice , in some state known only to him ( in @xcite this is called an _ anonymous _",
    "the honest strategies require alice to encode the bit by using this system in some way and then returning a committing system to bob .",
    "effectively alice now chooses not a _ state _ but a _ channel _ to encode her commitment .",
    "the purification idea and uhlmann fidelity estimate no longer work for this , so these protocols are not covered by lo - chau - mayers .",
    "instead , the purification construction has to be generalized to the stinespring representation of channels , and an appropriate continuity result has to be shown .",
    "this will be done in section  [ sec : proof ] .      that the idea of states supplied by bob may introduce interesting new aspects is demonstrated by a scenario which is not a bit commitment protocol in the sense of this section ,",
    "because it makes additional assumptions about things happening in bob s lab : suppose that after bob has sent some quantum state to alice , a decoherence monster ( such as the cleaning service ) enters his lab , and all quantum information is destroyed . only his classical records survive .",
    "that is , he still knows what preparation he made , but can not use the entangled records he made during the preparation .",
    "now suppose that alice and bob can rely on this happening .",
    "then they can design a bit commitment protocol that works .",
    "so , paradoxically , the monster strengthens bob s position , because it weakens the assumptions about his ability to break the concealment . hence one can make protocols which are binding in the strong sense described above , but concealing only if we assume that coherence in bob s lab is indeed destroyed .",
    "we will analyze this possibility in section  [ sec : monster ] .",
    "an apparent generalization would allow alice to choose her honest strategy @xmath13 at will from some set @xmath98 of honest strategies , and @xmath14 from @xmath99 .",
    "the idea is that now some @xmath100 might well be distinguishable from some @xmath101 for bob .",
    "concealment under such circumstances means that bob , on seeing data compatible with some @xmath13 during the commitment or holding phase can never be sure that they do not come from a certain @xmath14 . in other words , for every @xmath100 there must be an @xmath19-equivalent strategy @xmath101 .",
    "but then , according to our result , alice might develop a sneak flip attack on the basis of these two protocols alone .      in section",
    "[ sec : english ] , we excluded any communication in the holding phase , and , apart from a single message from alice to bob , also in the opening phase . there is , however , no problem to allow such communication , and some protocols , like kent s protocol using relativistic signal speed constraints @xcite , require a lot of communication in the holding phase .    of course , protocols with no rounds at all in the holding phase are directly covered by our definition .",
    "the only strategic difference between holding and commitment phase is that alice s cheating strategies @xmath21 and @xmath22 are only required to coincide during the commitment phase .",
    "she might start cheating with different tricks for @xmath11 and @xmath12 during the holding phase .    clearly , declaring the holding phase a part of the commitment phase only weakens alice s cheating possibility .",
    "however , she does not need these extra options anyway : a sneak flip attack at the end of the holding phase is always possible , as we show .      often in cryptography",
    "one considers protocols which allow the parties to call an `` abort '' .",
    "we can distinguish two kinds of abort : when a _ constructive abort _ , or _",
    "reset _ occurs , the protocol is started anew , whereas at a _ full abort _ the whole protocol is terminated as unsuccessful .",
    "both kinds of aborts are covered in our scheme , but they would be typical of different phases .",
    "resets are quite natural in the commitment phase . for example",
    ", bob might make a test measurement on some message he receives , and refuses to continue if there is a slight deviation from what is expected from alice playing honest .",
    "a reasonable requirement at this point is that the probability for reaching a commitment after some number of rounds with an honest alice is positive .",
    "then allowing even more retrials one could bring the probability for reaching commitment close to one , and allow some arbitrary choice in the remaining cases , i.e. , if the allotted total number of rounds is exhausted without a commitment . in this way one would get a protocol satisfying our finiteness condition , while retaining the potential value of resets for a commitment protocol . strictly speaking ,",
    "resets can only occur during the commitment phase , since we have demanded a partitioning of each protocol run into three successive phases ( without relapses into earlier phases ) .",
    "however , the holding phase can be essentially united with the commitment phase ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : holding ] ) .",
    "hence we can effectively also cover constructive aborts during the holding phase .    in the opening phase we can consider _ full _ , or destructive aborts .",
    "this is a move right to an endpoint of the communication tree , labelled accordingly .",
    "clearly this possibility weakens bob s discrimination powers , and makes it much easier to cheat for alice .",
    "in particular , each sneak flip attack becomes successful .",
    "therefore , the abort possibility does not seem to present any interesting strategic options for quantum bit commitment . the proof in sec .",
    "[ sec : proof ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "sometimes one considers settings in which a variety of different cryptographic protocols are run in parallel or in succession , usually with dependent inputs .",
    "obtaining bounds on the security of concatenated protocols in terms of the security parameters of their component parts is often far from straightforward , and a subject of ongoing research even in classical cryptography @xcite .",
    "however , in this work we are chiefly concerned with impossibility results , which easily transfer to concatenated protocols : running a finite number of ( possibly different ) bit commitment protocols in parallel or succession , and assuming that those protocols all fall into the framework described in this chapter , the concatenated protocol is again a quantum bit commitment protocol , with suitably enlarged hilbert and classical messenger spaces and possibly a larger number of rounds .",
    "since the latter protocol is covered by our impossibility result , concatenating finitely many insecure bit commitment protocols can not help to establish secure bit commitment .    the formulation of two party protocols that we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : formal ] is by no means limited to quantum bit commitment , and hence could also be used to model larger cryptographic environments , of which quantum bit commitment might be a subroutine . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] , such a protocol would appear as a subtree .",
    "concealment and bindingness would have to be guaranteed for the entire tree , and hence by restriction for the subtree .",
    "thus , no two - party cryptographic protocol covered by the framework described in sec .",
    "[ sec : formal ] can contain a secure bit commitment protocol .",
    "the composability analysis is of course much more involved for _ secure _ protocols .",
    "the security proof we provide in sec .",
    "[ sec : monster ] for the decoherence monster protocol in general only applies to the protocol as a stand - alone object .",
    "if this protocol is then used as a subroutine in a larger and complicated cryptographic context , the security analysis will usually have to be tailored to the specific protocol .",
    "fortunately , at least the cb - norm estimates we use in the proof of th .",
    "[ theo : monster ] are stabilized distance measures , and hence well - behaved under concatenation ( cf .",
    "in the exposition of the task of bit commitment and the admissible protocols we have tried not to restrict generality by simplifying assumptions , in order not to weaken the scope of the no - go theorem .",
    "this leads to a rather wild class of strategies to be considered : arbitrarily many rounds of communication of varying length , infinite - dimensional local lab hilbert spaces , and all that . clearly , in the course of the proof we want to get rid of this generality .",
    "the main idea for simplifications is that obviously inferior methods of analysis for bob , or inferior cheating methods for alice need not be considered .",
    "we therefore begin with an explanation of what it means that one strategy is `` obviously inferior '' , or _",
    "weaker _ than another ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : comparestrat ] ) .",
    "the first application of this idea is the process of _ purification _ , by which a general strategy is turned into another one , which avoids all measurements not demanded by the communication interface , and turns all decohering operations into coherent information transfer to ancillas",
    ". stinespring s dilation theorem guarantees that this can always be done .",
    "we explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : purification ] how the purifications result in _ locally coherent strategies _ , which will be crucial for alice s cheat later on , and have been a part of all no - go results .",
    "once a player has chosen a locally coherent strategy , it is possible to reduce the lab spaces considerably .",
    "for example , if a strategy requires the choice of a mixed state , this state may have an infinite - dimensional support hilbert space .",
    "its purification , however , is a single vector , so up to a unitary transformation , which can be absorbed into subsequent operations , it suffices to take a one dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we show that this works for operations as well : for every locally coherent strategy there is a stronger one ( in the sense of sec .",
    "[ sec : comparestrat ] ) , using only finite - dimensional hilbert spaces , with a universal dimension bound depending only on the dimension of quantum messages exchanged so far and the trusted ressources shared initially . in particular , an infinite - dimensional lab space will not give more power to bob .",
    "this will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : boundedh ] , and leads to the consequence that effectively ( up to any desired level of accuracy ) we need only consider a finite number of strategies for bob .",
    "the next step is in some sense a dual of purification : purification means that we can avoid measurements during a protocol , deferring all such operations to the final measurement .",
    "similarly , we can move the acts of decision making during the protocol to the very beginning , by introducing a _ strategy register _",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : register ] ) , which is described in the hilbert space @xmath102 , for some finite set @xmath103 of strategies .",
    "the choice of a strategy is then expressed by preparing some initial state of the strategy register , and then letting controlled unitaries transcribe this information into suitable operations at all later rounds .",
    "let us denote by @xmath104 bob s strategy of installing the strategy register mechanism , and preparing the initial state @xmath105 for that register .",
    "the state @xmath106 at commitment time then depends linearly on @xmath105 , and after specifying the trusted initial state @xmath73 and tracing out alice s lab , we find a channel @xmath107 depending on alice s strategy @xmath9 , such that @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "this channel now summarizes everything that bob can possibly learn about alice s strategy by choosing his own strategy and making a measurement in his lab after the commitment . in a simple , purely kerckhoffian scenario",
    "the analogous object is just the state at commitment time , since one does not allow bob a choice of different legitimate strategies .",
    "however , in our more general framework we do need to consider the dependence on @xmath105 , and correspondingly cheats which work uniformly well for all @xmath105 .",
    "as an instructive special case , we next suppose that the protocol is _ perfectly _ concealing , which is expressed by @xmath110 .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : perfect ] that alice then has a perfect cheat .",

    "one can see how an approximate cheat in response to approximate concealment @xmath111 should work .    in the next section",
    "we look more carefully into the kind of approximation @xmath111 sufficient to draw the desired conclusion .",
    "it turns out that we need to consider a special attempt of concealment breaking for bob , namely keeping an entangled record of the strategy register and making a joint measurement on the rest of his system and this `` backup copy '' after commitment .",
    "clearly , this is a legitimate attempt in our framework , and hence must already be implicit in the strategies controlled by the strategy register .",

    "_ for an honest alice _ there is no option . whatever the honest strategies @xmath13 and @xmath14 specify , she has to follow .",

    "indeed , this will be the only difference between the honest and the cheating strategies during the commitment phase : these consists of playing until commitment a particular strengthening of an honest strategy , namely the local purification discussed in the next subsection .",
    "intuitively , maintaining coherence during quantum operations is more demanding than allowing thermal noise and other sources of decoherence to have their way .",

    "the continuity theorem presented in section  [ sec : nogo ] below shows that the same cheating strategy still works for alice with high probability under more realistic conditions  when only approximate concealment is guaranteed , @xmath256 .",
    "the result crucially depends on the way in which the distance between these two channels is evaluated : bob can test the condition @xmath256 by preparing a state @xmath105 for the strategy register @xmath102 , and making a measurement on the system @xmath211 he receives back from alice .",
    "this includes both the possibility to superpose his original strategies @xmath216 , and the possibility to mix such strategies in the sense of game theory .",

    "it therefore makes sense to keep a record , i.e. , to not only use a mixed initial state , which would correspond to a mixed strategy in the sense of von neumann s game theory , but to use an entangled pure state on @xmath257 , with some reference system @xmath258 .",

    "thus , if we restrict the channel @xmath541 to the center @xmath637 , which is isomorphic to @xmath653 , then we obtain a measurement operation whose corresponding povm is given by the operators @xmath654 . to verify this",

    "this justifies the following interpretation : the quantum system under investigation is described by the observable algebra @xmath51 if the measurement results in the outcome @xmath660 . in other words ,",
    "the direct sum operation can be seen as a  logical xor \" composition of quantum systems  in contrast to the tensor product , which corresponds to the  logical and \" .",
    "coming back to the bit commitment protocol , the nodes of the communication tree then in fact have a natural interpretation as outcomes of a measurement process returning a history of communicated decisions , which are given by the unique path in the tree starting at its root and ending at @xmath323 .      in order to evaluate the concealment and bindingness conditions in a quantum bit commitment protocol we need to measure the distance between two quantum channels or two quantum states : assume two channels @xmath661 and @xmath662 with common input and output algebras @xmath133 and @xmath663 , respectively .",
    "since these @xmath664 are ( in heisenberg picture ) operators between normed spaces @xmath663 and @xmath133 , the natural choice to quantify their distance is the _ operator norm _ , @xmath665 the norm distance eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance01 ] ) has a neat operational characterization : it is twice the largest difference between the overall probabilities in two statistical quantum experiments differing only in replacing one use of @xmath661 with one use of @xmath662 .",
    "however , we also want to allow for more general experiments , in which the two channels are only applied to a sub - system of a larger system .",
    "this requires _",
    "stabilized _ distance measures @xcite , and naturally leads to the so - called _ norm of complete boundedness _ ( or _ cb - norm _ , for short ) @xcite : @xmath666 where @xmath609 again denotes the _ ideal _ ( or _ noiseless _ ) channel on the @xmath667-matrices . useful properties of the cb - norm include _ multiplicativity _ , i.e. , @xmath668 , and _ unitality : _ @xmath669 for any channel @xmath541 .    obviously , @xmath670 for every linear map @xmath541 .",
    "if either the input or output space is a classical system , we even have equality : @xmath671 ( cf .",

    "fully quantum systems generically show a separation between these two norms .",
    "+ states are channels with one - dimensional input space , @xmath672 . since this is a classical system ,",
