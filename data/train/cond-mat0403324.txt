    "mgb@xmath2 has attracted considerable attention due to its high t@xmath5 ( @xmath640k ) which is due to specific multi - band electronic structure ( see ref.@xcite and refs . therein ) . here",
    "superconductivity develops in two - dimensional cylindrical sheets of the fermi surface constituted from the @xmath3-band and three - dimensional tubular fermi surface from the @xmath4-band .",
    "the commonly accepted explanation for high - t@xmath5 superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 is connected with the strong interaction between the charge carriers and the @xmath7 phonon mode , @xcite caused by the antiparallel vibrations of the atoms in the honeycomb - like boron planes .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is distributed over the fermi surface of mgb@xmath2 , being @xmath8 7mev for the @xmath3-band and @xmath9 2mev for the @xmath4-band .",
    "@xcite the different properties of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands with different anisotropies result in very peculiar and interesting physical characteristics of mgb@xmath2 both in the normal and especially in the superconducting state .",
    "@xcite    point - contact ( pc ) spectroscopy is one of the straightforward methods which has proved the existence the double - gap superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "although much was done to understand the remarkable superconducting state in this diboride , some issues should be clarified , such as the behavior of the superconducting gaps in the magnetic field and the rapid depression of the superconducting features of the @xmath4-band in the pc conductivity by a moderate field of about 1  t. in this study we carried out pc measurements both of the order parameter and the excess current versus the magnetic field in mgb@xmath2 and analyzed them using the theory @xcite for the mixed state of a dirty two - band superconductor .",
    "our experiments were carried out on the mgb@xmath2 single - crystal samples investigated earlier in ref.@xcite .",
    "their properties are described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the crystals were small thin plates ( flakes ) of a sub - millimeter size .",
    "they were glued with silver epoxy to the sample holder at one of their side faces .",
    "the noble metal counter electrode was brought into a gentle touch with the opposite side face of the crystal in liquid helium .",
    "thus we tried to make a contact mainly along the _ ab _ plane , for which both the @xmath3 and @xmath4-band superconducting features should be present in the pc characteristics .",
    "the magnetic field was applied along the c - axis .    the @xmath0 characteristic and the differential resistance @xmath1 were recorded through sweeping dc current @xmath10 on which small ac current @xmath11 was superimposed and through measuring the alternating voltage @xmath12 using the standard lock - in technique .",
    "first we evaluated the characteristic length scales important for this study .",
    "the contact size for the typical resistance of 10@xmath13 is estimated by the sharvin formula @xmath14 ( @xmath15 nm in ref.@xcite ) irrespectively of the crystallographic directions . for",
    "a dirty constriction ( with a very short mean free path ) the use of the maxwell formula @xmath16 results in @xmath17 about 0.7 nm and 2.6 nm ( see ref.@xcite ) for the @xmath18 plane and @xmath19 direction , respectively .",
    "thus , the contact size can be of the order of magnitude or smaller than the elastic electron mean free path ( @xmath20 nm , @xmath21 nm , according to ref.@xcite ) , which means that theoretically we can approach the ballistic ( spectroscopic ) regime . in practice the spectroscopic regime is confirmed by observation of the characteristic andreev - reflection features in @xmath22 in the superconducting state .",
    "the measurements of the superconducting energy gap in mgb@xmath2 by means of the andreev reflection demonstrate two sets of the energy - gap minima in the differential resistance d@xmath23d@xmath10 at @xmath24 0.1 and @xmath250.4mev , respectively ; their distribution @xcite corresponds to the theoretical prediction .",
    "@xcite the d@xmath23d@xmath10 curves can be well fitted by the known btk @xcite equations ( with the suitable @xmath26 parameter ) for two conducting channels with the appropriate weight factors @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite the contribution of the large gap to the double - gap spectra @xmath28 is the largest along the @xmath18 plane and amounts theoretically to 0.34 , while it is negligible in the perpendicular direction ( along the @xmath19 axis ) . @xcite     for @xmath29 ( see fig.[koshel ] ) .",
    "inset : symmetrized experimental @xmath22 curves in magnetic field ( solid lines ) for the single crystal mgb@xmath2cu 2.2@xmath13 junction along the @xmath18 plane with btk fit ( thin lines ) from ref.@xcite .",
    "two separate sets of the gap minima around @xmath302.5 and @xmath307 mv are clearly seen in the low fields . ]    a series of @xmath22 measured in magnetic field is shown in fig.[m163](inset ) with clearly seen two sets of the gap minima ( double - gap features ) .",
    "the main panel in fig.[m163 ] displays the magnetic field dependence of the large and small gaps obtained by the routine btk fitting of the curves from the inset . in spite of the rapid decrease in the intensity of the small gap minima with the field ( a factor of two at 1 t ,",
    "see the inset in fig.[m163 ] ) , the small gap is not suppressed by low fields ( @xmath31 1 t ) , and the estimated critical field 6 - 7 t ( see fig.[m163 ] ) is much higher than that stated - band features in @xmath22 disappear visually ) with the critical field for the @xmath4 band might not be correct . ] in refs.@xcite .",
    "moreover this field corresponds to @xmath32 determined from the onset temperature in the broadened resistive transition in single crystals .",
    "@xcite similar behavior of the small gap persisting up to 5 t was found in ref.@xcite , where visual disappearance of the @xmath4-gap features in the pc characteristics was attributed to broadening of the spectra in the magnetic field .",
    "experimental data for @xmath33 in fig.[m163 ] are in good agreement with the magnetic field dependence of the maximal pair potential @xmath33 for mgb@xmath2 according to ref.@xcite with @xmath29 relation . under this condition",
    ", the smaller @xmath34 ( see fig.[koshel ] , dashed curve ) has a negative curvature in low and near to the critical fields , which is similar to the experimental @xmath35 ( see fig.[m163 ] ) .    the andreev reflection of electrons from the @xmath36 boundary in a @xmath37 point contact ( @xmath38 stands for the normal metal",
    ", @xmath19 is the constriction , and @xmath39 is the superconductor ) produces an excess current @xmath40 in the superconducting state . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 can be written @xcite at @xmath41 as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the superconducting energy gap and @xmath45 being the pc resistance in the normal state .",
    "we determined the reduced @xmath46 either from the raw @xmath0 or mostly by integrating the reduced @xmath47 or @xmath48 after subtracting the normal state background .",
    "the use of the @xmath0 curves provides less accurate results because of the resistance instability for some contacts during the field sweep .     and averaged electron dos @xmath49 at zero energy for two ratios of the diffusion constants @xmath50 for the @xmath3 ( 1 ) and @xmath4 ( 2 ) bands . by courtesy of koshelev and golubov .",
    "@xcite ]    for all investigated contacts the excess current depends on the magnetic field with the overall positive curvature ( fig.[iexcb ] ) . at first , @xmath51 decreases abruptly and then more slowly above 1 t .",
    "this corresponds to the aforementioned drastic suppression of the @xmath1 small - gap minima intensity by a magnetic field about 1 t and to the persistence of the residual superconducting minima on a further increase in the magnetic field .",
    "this is quite different from what is expected for @xmath40 according to ( [ exc ] ) , taking into account that @xmath52 has , as a rule , a negative curvature ( see fig.[koshel ] ) .    generally , the excess current , just like the net current through the contact , is proportional to the contact area @xmath53 ( see , e.g. , eqs.(18 ) , ( 19 ) in ref.@xcite ) , i.  e. @xmath54 . assuming that @xmath40 is caused by the superconducting component of the current , which in the mixed state is determined by the superconducting volume ( part ) in the pc area , the coefficient @xmath53 in the above - mentioned formula should be effectively reduced by the contribution of the nonsuperconducting volume .",
    "koshelev and golubov @xcite calculated the magnetic field dependence of the electron density of states ( dos ) @xmath55 at @xmath56=0 averaged over the vortex unit cell .",
    "we assume that in the first approximation the _ averaged _ @xmath57 can be regarded as a measure of the nonsuperconducting region in the mixed state , and , vice versa , @xmath58 characterizes the superconducting phase portion .",
    "thus , according to above reasoning , we suppose that @xmath59 with the weight factors @xmath28 and @xmath60 for large and small gaps , respectively ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are taken from fig.[koshel ] , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 . here , @xmath40 is presented is proportional to @xmath66 in the gapless state for a s - c - n junction with magnetic impurities ( see , e.g. , s.  i.  beloborodko , low temp .",
    "phys . , * 29 * , 650 ( 2003 ) and corresponding refs . therein ) .",
    "therefore , our assumption about the @xmath40 dependence on the averaged zero - energy density of states has some physical grounds .",
    "] by ( [ ikosh ] ) as a sum of two contribution from the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands weighted by @xmath67 factors , which along with @xmath33 were derived from the fitting of the andreev - reflection features in @xmath22 at zero field .",
    "vs magnetic field behavior for 3 pcs between the mgb@xmath2 single crystal and cu at 4.2k : ( a ) junction with small - gap minima and normal state resistance @xmath68=1.5@xmath13 , ( b ) junction with large - gap minima from ref.@xcite , @xmath68=6.7@xmath13 , ( c ) junction with double - gap structure from fig.[m163 ] , @xmath68=2.2@xmath13 .",
    "the lines present calculated @xmath51 according to ( [ ikosh ] ) with @xmath28 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 shown in each panel .",
    "the error bars show difference between @xmath51 calculated from the experimental ( insets , solid curves ) and btk ( insets , dashed curves ) @xmath22 .",

    "vertical bars are drawn to show relative @xmath22 value with respect to the contact resistance @xmath68 . ]",
    "figure[iexcb ] shows the magnetic field dependence of @xmath40 for three different types of @xmath22 with visually distinct small , large and double gap structures . here",
    ", we also plotted @xmath40 calculated by ( [ ikosh ] ) .",
    "the most unexpected result is the observation of @xmath22 ( see fig.[iexcb](b ) ) with large - gap minima only , which is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the large - gap minima are only slightly affected by magnetic fields of a few tesla .",
    "this is in contrast to the small - gap minima , which according to refs.@xcite should vanish above 1 t .",
    "the curve in the bottom panel was calculated taking @xmath28 from the fitting of the double - gap structure ( see fig.[m163 ] ) , while in panel ( a ) and ( b ) , where only the small- or large - gap structures are seen , @xmath28 can vary from zero to its highest value 0.34 .",
    "@xcite the latter @xmath28 value was used for the spectra in the middle panel in which only large - gap minima are seen .",
    "evaluation of @xmath28 for the spectrum in panel ( a ) inset is not straightforward because the spikes present at higher energies mask the large gap features .",
    "however , selected @xmath72 and @xmath73 fit reasonably both zero - field @xmath22 and @xmath51 curves in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .    in general , the experimental and calculated curves agree well in spite of the simple empiric model adopted for @xmath40 .",
    "the calculated curves describe qualitatively the experimental data , especially the abrupt initial decrease in @xmath40 , pronounced in the curves with the dominant small - gap features ( fig.[iexcb](a ) ) . in fig.[iexcb](c ) , showing two curves with different @xmath74 ratios , it is seen that better correspondence can be reached with an intermediate ratio between @xmath75 values .",
    "the same occurs for the data in fig.[iexcb](b ) for the large - gap spectrum , though the experimental data for large - gap and small - gap spectra are closer to the cases with @xmath29 .",
    "this fact testifies that in this case the @xmath3 band is closer to the clean limit , also mentioned in ref.@xcite .",
    "we have investigated the excess current in pcs based on single crystals of mgb@xmath2 in the magnetic field and proposed an empiric model for the excess current behavior in the mixed state . using this model , a magnetic field dependence of the excess current",
    "was obtained , which is in qualitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "the anomalous magnetic field dependence of the excess current in pcs reflects the specific two - band structure of the superconducting order parameter and the spatial dos behavior in mgb@xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 can be used for evaluation of the diffusivity in both bands on the base of koshelev and golubov s theory .",
    "we are indebted to a.  e.  koshelev for providing theoretical data and l.  v.  tyutrina for the help in the @xmath1 fitting . the fruitful discussion with s. i. beloborodko , s .- l . drechsler and a. n. omelyanchouk and their comments are highly acknowledged .",
