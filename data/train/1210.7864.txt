    "this picture has had tremendous success describing the proton structure at very short distances , high-@xmath0 jets in hadronic collisions , and more . however , for a probe of fixed size @xmath1 ( well below the confinement scale of @xmath2  fm ) in the high - energy limit this picture is expected to break down .",
    "this is due to ample radiation in qcd of soft gluons as phase space opens up  @xcite . as a consequence , although the qcd coupling at the scale @xmath1 may be small there are many @xmath3 partners to interact with .",
    "thus , at high energies hadrons rather correspond to a dense system of gluons and non - perturbatively strong fields , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the high occupation number these can be described as classical color fields sourced by the `` valence '' charges at higher rapidities which have been integrated out  @xcite .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) is an effective theory describing the dynamics of non - linear color fields at high energies .",
    "exploring its properties and systematically improving its accuracy is one of the main goals of the high - energy nuclear physics programme .    at present ,",
    "the most suitable process for studies of high gluon density qcd is p+a collisions where a relatively dilute projectile probes a dense target .",
    "particle production in the forward region of d+au collisions at rhic energy has discovered an interesting suppression relative to a simple superposition of binary p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , due to limited phase space those measurements are restricted to relatively low transverse momenta and can not probe accurately the tails of the intrinsic gluon transverse momentum distributions .",
    "also , quantitative calculations suffer from large uncertainties from a variety of sources : the large-@xmath5 parton distributions of the projectile ( @xmath6 ) , the large-@xmath7 behavior of parton fragmentation functions ( @xmath8 ) , nlo corrections to the `` hybrid formalism '' at high @xmath9 ( see below ) , and so on .",
    "presently , many eyes in this community are therefore focused on the upcoming p+pb run at the lhc at @xmath10  tev which will open up phase space for small-@xmath5 physics tremendously .",
    "this write - up shall therefore also focus mainly ( but not exclusively ) on recent predictions for p+pb collisions at the lhc based on the cgc approach .",

    "this distribution is gaussian  @xcite , [ eq : s_mv ] s_mv [ ] = d^2r dy  .",
    "the variance @xmath13 is proportional to the thickness of the target ( @xmath14 for a nucleus , on average over impact parameters ) since the sources act coherently .",
    "the classical field @xmath15 is obtained from @xmath11 by solving the yang - mills equations , analogous to the weizscker - williams approach in electrodynamics .    at the purely classical level",
    "the saturation momentum is energy independent .",
    "energy dependence arises from quantum corrections to the classical field .",
    "it is not presently known how to incorporate all quantum corrections but a specific class of quantum fluctuations , those which are approximately boost invariant and are proportional to @xmath16 can be re - summed .",
    "for the two - point correlation function of light - like wilson line operators , the so - called dipole scattering amplitude ( r ) =  , this is accomplished by the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation : = d^2 r_1 k(r , r_1,r_2 )  .",
    "[ eq : bk ] due to the presence of non - linear effects this equation leads to _ saturation _ of the scattering amplitude at large dipole sizes @xmath1 or small intrinsic transverse momenta @xmath17 .",

    "( [ eq : bk ] ) is nowadays solved with running coupling accuracy  @xcite , and one of the main goals in this field is to test whether the evolution speed predicted by rcbk is consistent with observations or if improved accuracy is required . from the fourier",
    "transform of @xmath20 ( transformed to the adjoint representation ) one obtains the ( dipole ) unintegrated gluon distribution ( ugd ) @xmath21 .    solving  ( [ eq : bk ] ) requires an initial condition @xmath22 , where the reference rapidity @xmath23 is typically estimated to be @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite performed detailed fits to ( the most recent ) hera dis data and found that a larger value for the initial `` anomalous dimension '' is preferred .",
    "below , we shall see that semi - hard @xmath9 distributions in p+p collisions are consistent with the aamqs initial condition coupled with rcbk evolution but clearly exclude the mv model initial condition for protons . as a first quantitative achievement we thus note that the proton rcbk - ugd at small @xmath28 ( averaged over impact parameter ) is now known to some degree of accuracy .",
    "however , the physical origin of the aamqs correction to @xmath29 , which corresponds to a suppression of the classical @xmath30 bremsstrahlung tail , is not very well understood .",
    "since the valence charge density in a proton at @xmath31 is not very large one may consider corrections of order @xmath32 to the mv model action  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-integrated multiplicity of charged particles is the most basic observable in particle collisions . for a variety of reasons",
    "though , the `` details '' are too many to discuss here , it is also hard to compute precisely , unfortunately .",
    "that said , one may hope that the main dependence of @xmath33 on energy and system size is through the saturation scale @xmath34 and so it is certainly warranted to check how this compares to data .",
    "this issue was first addressed by the kln model which indeed is in reasonable agreement , certainly well within its level of accuracy and credibility , with the centrality dependence of the multiplicity at midrapidity in au+au and d+au collisions at rhic , pb+pb collisions at lhc , and even p+p collisions from 0.9  7  tev ; for the most recent compilation and references to the original kln papers we refer to ref .",
