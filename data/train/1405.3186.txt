    "the herschel space observatory @xcite is the fourth `` cornerstone '' mission in the esa horizon 2000 science programme .",
    "it has been the first large aperture space far  infrared ( fir)/sub  mm observatory , performing photometry and spectroscopy in the 55672@xmath0 m wavelength range .",
    "the observatory consisted of a telescope with a large ( 3.5 m ) monolithic low emissivity passively cooled mirror and three focal plane science instruments enclosed in a large heii cryostat : the pacs instrument @xcite , consisting of _ ( a ) _ a dual - band photometer , comprising a `` blue photometer '' with two filters mounted in a wheel , allowing to select a range centred at either 70@xmath0 m or 100@xmath0 m and a `` red photometer '' covering a spectral range centred at 160@xmath0 m ; and _ ( b ) _ an integral field spectrometer in the range .",
    "the photometric bands covered the same field - of - view ( fov ) , while the fov of the spectrometer was offset from the photometer .",
    "the spire instrument @xcite consisted of a three - band imaging photometer and an imaging fourier transform spectrometer .",
    "as for the pacs instrument , the photometer and spectrometer did not operate simultaneously .",
    "the three photometer arrays provided broad - band photometry in bands centred at 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath0 m with a common fov , and the spectrometer was also offset from the photometer . finally , the hifi instrument @xcite was a high - resolution heterodyne spectrometer with a continuous coverage from 480 to 1250  ghz in five bands , plus two bands providing a coverage of the 14101910  ghz range .",
    "both polarisations of the astronomical signal were detected for maximum sensitivity . to cover a wide frequency range with high sensitivity , hifi was designed to have 7 mixer bands and 14 local oscillator sub - bands ( two frequency sections per band ) .",
    "figure [ herschel_fov ] shows the position of the instruments apertures within the herschel fov .",
    "the herschel spacecraft ( s / c ) had a modular design , comprising the extended payload module ( eplm ) and the service module ( svm ) .",
    "the eplm consisted of the payload module described above , the sunshade and solar array and payload associated equipment .",
    "the svm housed `` warm '' payload electronics and provided services such as power , attitude and orbit control , the on - board data handling and command execution , communications , and safety .",
    "the herschel s / c was stabilised in three - axes .",
    "the attitude was commanded by means of reaction wheels and controlled using star trackers and gyroscopes , as described in section [ sec : acms ] .",
    "the s / c pointing modes were based either on stare pointings ( fine pointing mode ) or moving pointings at constant rate ( line scan mode ) .",
    "raster maps are `` grids '' of stare pointings at regular spacings ; scan maps are sequences of line scans at regular spacing . allowed scan angular speed ranged from 0.1arcsec",
    "/ s to 1arcmin / s .",
    "in addition , the herschel spacecraft could track moving solar system targets at rates up to 10arcsec / min .",
    "the s / c slewed between different pointing positions at rates up to 7arcmin / s .",
    "the pointing calibration tasks were aimed , on the one hand , to provide an accurate alignment of the different fields of view of each instrument and instrument mode described above with respect to the telescope and the s / c attitude reference frame , and on the other , to characterise the performance of the various pointing modes .",
    "this paper describes these activities and is structured as follows : in section [ sec : acms ] , we discuss the basic elements of the attitude control and measurement system ( acms ) and the route of telemetry ( tm ) data from the spacecraft to the herschel science centre ( hsc ) at the european space astronomy centre ( esac ) . section [ sec : products ] is devoted to the pointing - related products generated at the hsc : the pointing product , the acms tm product and the spacecraft / instrument alignment matrices ( siam ) product .",
    "section [ sec : calib_params ] deals with the main calibration parameters of the herschel spacecraft pointing system and historical description of the evolution of the indicators of its performance , that in general met or surpassed the requirements set . however , given a clear scientific motivation for further improvement ( see section [ sec : calib_params ] ) , an outstanding effort has been done and is still being invested : in section [ sec : pointing_improvement ] , the work carried out within the ground segment centres to improve the s / c pointing measurements is described . on - going and future developments towards a final refinement of the herschel astrometry are also described .",
    "the control of the positioning of the herschel spacecraft ( s / c ) was carried out by its attitude control and measurement system ( acms ) .",
    "the main components were @xcite : _",
    "( i ) _ the attitude control computer ( acc ) ; _ ( ii ) _ gyroscopes ( gyr ; four units ) ; _ ( iii ) _ star trackers ( str ) : two units , with boresights approximately opposite to that of the telescope ; _ ( iv ) _ the assembly of four reaction wheels ( rwa ) to perform pointing manoeuvres ; _ ( v ) _ the reaction control system ( rcs ) , i.e. the set of thrusters used for orbit manoeuvres and reaction wheel biasing ; _ ( vi ) _ the sun acquisition sensors ( sas ) ; _ ( vii ) _ the coarse rate sensors ( crs ) ; and _ ( viii ) _ the attitude anomaly detectors ( aad ) .",
    "the different elements of the acms are depicted in fig .",
    "[ acms_blocks ] and described in @xcite .",
    "the star trackers ( str ) were small telescopes with ccd detectors whose main function was the determination of the s / c attitude . the herschel s / c had two ( cold ) redundant autonomous units built by selex galileo s.p.a .",
    "the str telescope had a focal length of 30 mm and an f / number of 1.2 , yielding a large fov of 16.4@xmath116.4deg@xmath2 .",
    "the ccd detector used was the atmel th78900 , with 512@xmath1512pixels of 17@xmath0 m .",
    "the plate scale was therefore 116.9arcsec / pixel ( the ccd area is slightly larger than the fov ) .",
    "the herschel strs had the ability to determine the inertial position from a `` lost in space '' situation , or tracking from a known attitude .",
    "to this end , an on - board star catalogue , based on hipparcos , was used .",
    "the criteria applied to build this catalogue included a specific range of brightness , a colour threshold , a low variability tolerance , reduced proper motion and absence of close companions or neighbours @xcite .",
    "the on - board catalogue contained 3599 stars , out of which originally 3047 ( 85% , but cf .",
    "section [ subsec : od1011_to_eol ] ) were enabled for tracking purposes .",
    "a minimum of 3 stars should be acquired within the fov . due to hardware limitations",
    ", a maximum of 9 stars could be simultaneously used for attitude determination .",
    "nevertheless , there was an enhanced performance mode called `` interlacing function '' , only applicable if @xmath315 trackable stars were located within the fov . in this mode ,",
    "the str determined the attitude using two different sets of stars from two consecutive frames , ( i.e. each set of stars were sampled at half the nominal 4hz sampling frequency ) . in this way , up to 18 stars could be used for attitude determination . due to the large weight of the str measures in the attitude estimation , the highly undersampled str fov was the largest contributor to the absolute pointing error ( ape ) . on top of that ,",
    "the position - dependent str bias was caused by flat - fielding effects and optical distortions .",
    "on average , the contribution to the ape was 0.8@xmath1@xmath4arcsec .",
    "the mounting of the strs with respect to the s / c and telescope viewing direction is shown in fig .",
    "[ str_sketch ] ( left ) .",
    "note that the strs pointed approximately at 180@xmath5 w.r.t .",
    "the telescope boresight ( @xmath6 ; see definition in section [ sec : products ] below ) .",
    "both strs were mounted on a carbon fibre platform suspended by struts from the lower dome of the cryostat vacuum vessel ( cvv ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ str_sketch ] ( right ) .",
    "the struts were partly made of glass fibre , to minimise the conducted heat input to the cvv , and partly of carbon fibre , to minimise the thermoelastic distortions @xcite .",
    "only one str could be operative at a given time , the other unit kept as backup .",
    "the possibility of using both strs simultaneously to ease the calibration of their mutual misalignment was ruled out due to the alteration of the pointing due thermoelastic distortion caused by the excessive heat dissipated .",
    "the herschel s / c used hemispherical resonating gyroscopes .",
    "these consist of a thin - walled quartz shell that is energized by an electrical field to produce a vibration pattern within itself .",
    "the gyroscopes were used to sense and respond to changes in the inertial orientation of its spin axis .",
    "rate / rate - integrating gyroscopes provided high - precision measures of the s / c angular speed . the herschel s acms was provided with four gyroscopes mounted in a tetrahedral configuration .",
    "the four gyroscopes were hot - redundant .",
    "the fourth gyroscope was not used for control , but served to detect an inconsistency in the output of the other three .",
    "estimates of the satellite attitude quaternion and inertial rate vector were obtained combining data from gyr and str .",
    "the estimator was based on a `` model replacement approach '' in which a dynamical model for the evolution of the quaternion states was replaced by integration of the kinematics equations of motion , driven by angular rate measurements from the gyro . in the nominal estimator the state ( attitude quaternion , rate estimate and gyr bias )",
    "was propagated from the previous estimate using the gyro data .",
    "this was then combined with the latest str measurement to obtain an updated state estimate which was subsequently used for control .",
    "the main reason for the inclusion of gyr data in the model is that the str measurements were delayed by 1.5 cycles due to integration and internal processing .",
    "finally , the actuation was performed by means of the rwa .",
    "the attitude information derived by the acms was down - linked at a rate of 4hz when the s / c is in normal science mode ( scm ) operation .",
    "the telemetry ( tm ) was processed at the mission operations centre ( moc ) .",
    "the flight dynamics team produced the so - called `` attitude history file '' ( ahf ) per operations day ( od ) basis .",
    "the ahf packed the acms scm tm generated at 4hz for slew , point and line scan operations .",
    "it was an ascii - formatted file that included the on - board time , commanded attitude , acms - processed attitude ( the so - called filtered attitude ) , three - axes x , y and z calibrated angular rates , s / c solar aspect angle ( saa ) , measurement quality flags etc .",
    "the ahf was transferred automatically to the hsc within 8 hours of the end of the od .",
    "it triggered the start of the processing of auxiliary products ( e.g. housekeeping telemetry , radiation monitory data , orbit data , etc . ) at the hsc .",
    "the information produced by the acms was processed ( and is still re - processed ) by the hsc and stored in `` products '' .",
    "these data structures can be accessed from the observation context ( a sort of container of the scientific and housekeeping data belonging to a given observation ) .",
    "the pointing - related products belong to the `` auxiliary products '' category .",
    "three classes have been defined : pointing product , acms tm product and spacecraft / instrument alignment matrices ( siam ) product .",
    "the pointing product is the most important of these data structures .",
    "it packs the information contained in the ahf , combined with up - link information from the planned observation sequence ( pos ) file . the pointing product consists of sequences of table data sets ( analogous to fits binary tables ) including : on - board time , commanded attitude quaternion , different estimates of the attained attitude quaternion , attitude error estimates , number of tracked stars , etc .",
    "it is produced per od , but sliced per observation .",
    "the detailed contents of the product can be found in table [ pointingprod ] .",
    "the acms tm product contains all the relevant information required to re - estimate the s / c attitude from scratch . sliced per observation , uses essential tm , scm tm and diagnostics tm .",
    "it includes many acms database parameters as metadata entries ( analogous to the fits header s keywords ) .",
    "product s data records include estimated attitude quaternion , str quaternion , calibrated gyro rates , ids , positions , magnitudes and colours of tracked stars , gyr calibration parameters etc .",
    "the spacecraft / instrument alignment matrices ( siam ) product contains 3@xmath13 proper orthogonal rotation matrices dcm@xmath7 converting the coordinates of a vector in the herschel spacecraft reference frame ( spacecraft control axes , sca ; also known as attitude control axes , aca ) into a given instrument reference frame ( ins ) , i.e. :    @xmath8    the product contains one rotation matrix per instrument ( see a brief description of the instruments in section in [ intro ] ) , i.e. 2 matrices for pacs ( one for the photometer aperture and one for the spectrometer one ) , 56 matrices for hifi ( the apertures are defined for the 7 bands , 2 sub - bands per band , 2 polarisations and 2 chopper positions ) and 75 matrices for spire ( the spire apertures are defined at pixel level , 17 for the photometer and 57 for the spectrometer , plus an additional aperture for the so - called spire / pacs parallel mode ; this aperture is placed in the midpoint between the pacs and spire photometers , approximately in the centre of the telescope fov . in normal scientific operation , only the central photometer and spectrometer apertures , plus the parallel mode one , are used ) .",
    "the alignment matrices were determined by means of dedicated calibration observations , mainly during performance verification phase ( see section [ sec : calib_params ] ) . for astrometrical purposes ,",
    "there are two valid siam files across the whole mission : 0122_0001 ( od@xmath9320 ) and 0341_0001(od@xmath3320 ) .",
    "this is due to the change in the str ccd reference temperature that took place in od320 and will be thoroughly explained in the next section .",
    "the main pointing calibration activities were carried out during commissioning ( cop ; some 60 ods ) and performance verification ( pvp ; approximately 90 ods ) phases using the scientific instruments .",
    "these calibrations were aimed , on the one hand , to accurately determine the location of the different instrument apertures ( i.e. computation of the siams ) , and on the other hand , to derive the main figures of merit characterising the pointing performance .",
    "these are according to @xcite the absolute pointing error ( ape ) , defined as the angular separation between the desired direction and the instantaneous actual direction ; the pointing drift error ( pde ) , defined as the angular separation between the average pointing direction over some interval ( nominally 55min ) and a similar average at a later time ( nominally after 24hours ) , is a measure of the long - term stability of the s / c pointing , while the relative pointing error ( rpe , also referred to as pointing stability ) is the angular separation between the instantaneous pointing direction and the short - time average pointing direction at a given time period ( fixed at 60s ) ; finally , the spatial relative pointing error ( srpe ) is defined as the angular separation between the average orientation of the satellite fixed axis and a pointing reference axis which is defined relative to an initial reference direction : this measurement is important to characterise the accuracy of the relative astrometry in a map comprising several pointings ( e.g. a raster or scan map ) .    the pointing error specifications are expressed as half - cone angles of the line - of - sight ( los ) and half - sector angles around the los .",
    "they are specified at a temporal probability level of 68% , which implies that the error will be less than the requirement for 68% of the time for each pointing direction . for herschel",
    ", it was required that the ape in stare pointings was 3.7arcsec ( los ) and 3.0arcmin ( around los ) .",
    "the pde requirement ( measured within a 24h period ) is 1.20arcsec ( los ) and 3.0arcmin ( around los ) .",
    "the rpe requirement ( for a period of 60s ) is 0.30arcsec ( los ) and 1.5arcmin ( around los ) . finally ,",
    "regarding the spatial relative pointing accuracy , it was required that , in consecutive pointings within a 4@xmath5@xmath14@xmath5 spherical area , the srpe of all pointings following the initial pointing , as referred to the average pointing direction of the first pointing shall be less than 1arcsec ( los ) . table [ req_pred ] summarises the initial requirements for the main pointing figures of merit as given in the early mission definition phase and their predicted performance from pre - launch testing campaigns .",
    "it was anticipated a non - compliance of the srpe ( 2.24arcsec predicted vs. 1.0arcsec required ) but the rest of the requirements were clearly met or exceeded . as will be shown below ,",
    "the in - orbit performance of the herschel s / c confirmed these predictions . however , beyond the early defined requirements shown in table [ req_pred ] ( issued when the final characteristics of the instruments were only barely known ) , and given herschel instruments beams as small as 5arcsec fwhm at the shortest wavelengths , there was a clear scientific motivation for further improvement , for better centring of spectroscopic observations on source , as well as for better a posteriori reconstruction of the actual pointing in imaging and spectroscopy .",

    "new siams were derived by planning and executing dedicated calibration observations with the pacs , spire and hifi instruments , as described in @xcite and @xcite . the first calibration ( serving as reference for the initial bulk shift of all instruments apertures with respect to the original siam set used at launch time ) , the alignment of the pacs photometer aperture , and almost all measurements of the pointing performance were carried out with the pacs photometer point - source mode and the `` blue '' camera with the 70@xmath10 m filter ( the shortest photometric wavelength ) since this configuration gave the best spatial resolution .",
    "a thorough description of the pacs chopped point - source photometry observing mode is given in @xcite .",
    "a catalogue of several hundred stars with strong , purely photospheric fir flux densities compiled by the pacs instrument control centre ( icc ) @xcite was used , in order to ensure that their fir emission was as compact as possible ( i.e. no dust shells ) .",
    "the observations were processed using dedicated scripts within the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sky positions of the centroids of the target stars within the 70@xmath0 m pacs photometer maps , derived from the herschel astrometry were compared with the catalogue positions ( either hipparcos or 2mass ) .",
    "this was done for relatively large sets of targets ( typically more than 40 ) in order to obtain distributions of offsets along the y and z axes .",
    "these were generally very well fitted by gaussian distributions .",
    "the ( @xmath11 ) average offsets were used to derive the alignment matrices , while the standard deviations of the distributions were used to derive a proxy , ape@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 , for the absolute pointing accuracy that would be achieved with the alignments corrected is not the proper ape , that is defined in temporal terms .",
    "a justification for the use of this proxy is given in @xcite , where it is shown that it introduces an additional error of typically only 0.1arcsec .",
    "the original set of matrices obtained from pvp observations were derived with a str ccd reference temperature of 20@xmath5c . in od320",
    ", the reference temperature was lowered to -10@xmath5c in order to reduce the number of `` warm '' str ccd pixels ( see below ) . as a result ,",
    "a bulk shift of all instruments apertures occurred and a new siam set was computed accordingly .",
    "this new collection of matrices was used throughout the rest of the s / c operations .",
    "the main figures of merit , namely ape , srpe and rpe were derived from pacs photometer pvp observations ( see section [ subsec : launch_to_od320 ] ) .",
    "the pointing drift dependency on the solar aspect angle ( saa ; angle from the s / c boresight x axis to the sun vector ) was also assessed ( and estimated to be significant only for saa@xmath3110@xmath5 ) .",
    "in routine science phase ( rsp ) , a new pointing calibration plan was designed @xcite ; its goal was twofold : on the one hand , to provide a periodic verification of the pointing calibration ( alignment matrices ) , and on the other , to detect potential variations of the pointing performance .",
    "more than one - thousand pointing calibrations have been performed during rsp .",
    "the pacs photometer in point - source mode ( with dithering ) and the `` blue camera '' with the 70@xmath0 m filter was preferentially used .",
    "but some scan map observations were included as well ( pacs photometer mini - map mode ) .",
    "the pointing performance was found to be similar to that obtained in point - source mode ( see below ) .",
    "also , an accurate calibration of the relative misalignment of the two str units ( prime and backup ) was performed in od732 ( 44 calibration observations were planned and executed with the backup str unit configured as operational . in this way , not only the misalignment of both strs but also the pointing accuracy achievable with the backup unit was estimated ) .",
    "since the accessible area of the sky was restricted during the daily telecommunications period ( dtcp ) , rsp pointing calibration observations compatible with the dtcp restriction were generally selected .",
    "this optimised the scientific return by not blocking with these calibration measurements observing time outside the dtcp with much more flexible pointing constraints ( and therefore more suitable for general scientific observations ) .",
    "however , the drawback of this strategy was that position - dependent effects could not be detected at earlier stages ( see section [ subsec : od320_to_od762 ] below ) .",
    "one of the main pointing issues found early in the mission was the existence of the so - called `` speed bumps '' , namely events of departure from the nominal attitude observed in scan maps , easily recognizable in the s / c velocity norm profile as local maxima ( `` bumps '' ) .",
    "the cause of these anomalies was traced by the acms manufactures to the existence of a growing number of high - signal or `` warm '' pixels in the str ccd .",
    "this problem was corrected by lowering the reference temperature of the str ccd to -10@xmath5c in od320 .",
    "unfortunately , a side effect of this action was an important increment of str plate scale errors and section [ subsec : implemented_improvements ] . ] ( equivalent to unequal focal length corrections in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes ) , introduced by the str ccd temperature change .",
    "these errors produced systematic , orientation - dependent offsets .",
    "the problem was partially corrected by applying a one - dimensional str focal plane correction that took place in od762 ( this was implemented by modifying the nominal on - board focal length value of the str , @xmath17 .",
    "this is equivalent to assume identical focal length corrections in both axes , i.e. @xmath18 ) .",
    "the final on - board performance was greatly improved thanks to three major developments , implemented step by step :    1 .   in a first step ( tested in od858 and used from od866 to od1010 ) ,",
    "a linear two - dimensional str correction ( i.e. @xmath19 ) was uploaded , boosting the pointing performance to ape@xmath12@xmath201.0  1.1arcsec .",
    "2 .   in a second step ( since od1011 ) , the full str focal plane distortion correction ( 8 polynomial coefficients per axis ) , computed in parallel by the pacs icc and the esa / flight dynamics systems ( fds ) team at the moc was uploaded , producing a further improvement in the performance , ape@xmath12@xmath200.8  0.9arcsec .",
    "3 .   in a third step ( since od1032 ) , several `` dubious '' stars ( see section [ subsec : od1011_to_eol ] ) were removed from the on - board str tracking catalogue , yielding the final ape@xmath12 figure rather homogenous in the sky , provided that enough tracking stars were available and that `` cold '' s / c attitude conditions applied110@xmath5 were considered as problematic due to the risk of heating some components of the str support structure . ] .    in the following subsections ,",
    "the evolution of the pointing performance is detailed .",
    "the most representative ape@xmath12 estimate was derived using pacs photometer point source observations during the pvp .",
    "a large set of observations ( approximately 250 ) in six ods ( 38 , 64 , 86 , 92 , 101 & 104 ) were used to derive the pacs photometer aperture position ( named ` p01_0 ` ) and also the absolute pointing performance figure .",
    "in addition , a large pointing campaign was implemented in od274 to determine the pointing performance depending on the str interlacing ( il ; see section [ sec : acms ] ) mode : _ il - disabled _ , up to 9 stars tracked at a time , and _",
    "il - enabled _ , from 15 to 18 stars sampled alternatively in two `` planes '' .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ ape_tab1 ] .",
    "the ape@xmath12 was measured to be between 1.9 and 2.2arcsec depending on the enabling of interlacing .",

    "the first routine pointing calibration observations were executed .",
    "the plate scale errors translated into variations of the dispersion of the distribution of pointing calibration observations ; nevertheless , this was not clearly and immediately reflected in the statistical results obtained from the pointing calibration campaigns : while in cycles 1522 , the ape@xmath12 was consistent with pvp results , an outstanding increase was observed in cycles 2331 and a decrease thereafter , as summarized in table [ ape_tab2 ] .",
    "the investigation revealed that the effect was very small when the distribution of tracked stars was uniform across the str fov , but large , sometimes as much as @xmath258arcsec when the distribution of guide stars was asymmetric ( see a detailed explanation in sect .",
    "2.4.2 of @xcite .",
    "this explains the different behaviour of the dispersion of measurements depending on the considered period , since , as explained above , the rsp pointing calibration observations were preferentially performed in the relatively small sky area compatible with the dtcp constraints .",
    "this sky patch changes and moves slowly across the sky and therefore varies usually little within the time frame of a cycle .",

    "a thorough study of the evolution of the attitude offsets across the whole period was performed ( see fig .",
    "[ pointing_offset_evolution ] ) : while the y axis showed no trend ( just random dispersion around a zero offset ) , the z axis exhibited a clear trend towards negative z offsets , with two peaks separated by exactly one year .",
    "the offsets were apparently not associated to problems ( e.g. incorrect astrometry ) of the pointing targets themselves .",
    "rather , the problem was traced to be related to the scheduling of long observations at negative beta ( pitch ) angles , corresponding to `` warm '' attitudes . as explained before",
    ", the term refers to attitudes where the str supporting structures are subject to thermal distortions since they are not completely shaded from sunlight .",
    "in fact , in all but two cases of large astrometric z offsets ( larger than 2.5arcsec ) , long periods ( @xmath310hr ) at `` warm '' attitudes ( -20@xmath5@xmath28@xmath29@xmath28 - 10@xmath5 i.e. 110@xmath5@xmath3saa@xmath3100@xmath5 ) took place two or less hours before the time of the pointing calibration observations . on the other hand , none of the correct ( i.e. with reduced offset ) observations investigated ( randomly picked )",
    "were carried out in or after negative attitude periods .",
    "this indicated that the impact of relatively `` mild '' negative beta angles was larger than previously suspected .",
    "therefore , scheduling restrictions in the range 110@xmath5@xmath3saa@xmath3100@xmath5 were enforced until the end of the operational mission .        after removing several suspicious ods ( 872 , 911 , 932 , 969 , 1172 , 1216 , 1236 , 1251 , 1265 & 1266 ) from the statistics ,",

    "a long staring observation for 8.25 hours , similar to the one for hip  117591 was performed , to monitor the influence of the previous warm attitudes onto the pointing performance .",

    "the relative offsets dy and dz in arcseconds from the expected centre position are shown . since for both stars ,",
    "the measurements are separated into three parts , each having 60 chop / nod cycles , each graph contains the information of 180 elementary pointing measurements .",
    "the time evolution is indicated by a colour coding , going along the 8.25 hours per star from deep purple towards bright red . for hip  117591 ,",
    "an evolution of the pointing offsets mainly in ( negative ) z - direction is clearly visible , an imprint of the warm attitude , which gets obvious after the first chunk of measurements , lasting for 2.75 hours .",
    "also visible is the effect of re - pointing after 60 and 120 chop / nod cycles , which separates the offset values into three distinct clouds of points .",
    "the second graph , for hip  72208 , then demonstrates that after 12 hours at very warm attitudes , the relaxation to a normal pointing performance takes a long time . after the beginning of these observations at cold attitudes , the pointing offset in z - direction continues to increase further by roughly one arcsec , which might indicate a slight hysteresis effect in the thermal relaxation of the str structures . even after dwelling for 8.25 hours at this cold attitude , the pointing offset in z - direction",
    "did not improved much compared to the beginning of the measurement .",
    "this demonstrated that such extreme warm attitudes had to be avoided for normal s / c operations .",

    "3 .   for the trackable stars within the fov , determine the direction vectors using the str `` focal length '' linear correction factors provided by fds .",
    "these linear factors are introduced in the following way : the direction vector of a star in the str boresight frame can be expressed in the small angle approximation as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the star s coordinates in the str ccd frame , and @xmath34 is the str telescope s focal length . the linear `` focal length '' correction terms are introduced by replacing @xmath34 by @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the y and z axes , respectively . therefore , @xmath37 gets replaced by @xmath38 and an identical expression for the z axis .",
    "then , the corrected star vectors can be approximated as : @xmath39 ^ 2 + \\left [ \\frac{z}{f } \\left ( 1 - \\frac{\\delta f_z}{f } \\right ) \\right]^2}\\ ] ] + specific correction factors have been derived and provided by fds for the different mission periods up to od866 ( when the linear 2d was implemented on - board ) .",

    "for the chosen stars , given the direction vectors and the inertial ( reference ) vectors , determine the best attitude using the _ * q * method _ ( see @xcite and references therein ) that provides a means for computing an optimal three - axis attitude from many vector observations .",
    "replace the filtered quaternion by the modified quaternion computed by the _ *",

    "<S> we present the activities carried out to calibrate and characterise the performance of the elements of attitude control and measurement on board the herschel spacecraft . </S>",
    "<S> the main calibration parameters and the evolution of the indicators of the pointing performance are described , from the initial values derived from the observations carried out in the performance verification phase to those attained in the last year and half of mission , an absolute pointing error around or even below 1arcsec , a spatial relative pointing error of some 1arcsec and a pointing stability below 0.2arsec . </S>",
    "<S> the actions carried out at the ground segment to improve the spacecraft pointing measurements are outlined . on - going and future developments towards a final refinement of the herschel astrometry </S>",
    "<S> are also summarised . a brief description of the different components of the attitude control and measurement system ( both in the space and in the ground segments ) is also given for reference . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the importance of the cooperation between the different actors ( scientists , flight dynamics and systems engineers , attitude control and measurement hardware designers , star - tracker manufacturers , etc . ) to attain the final level of performance . </S>"
