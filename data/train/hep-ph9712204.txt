    "hadron internal dynamics is described by qcd but in deriving their properties many problems arise essentially due to the mathematical complexity of relativistic bound state problems in non abelian gauge theories .",
    "this has led to techniques and approximation schemes to perform phenomenological calculations which differ according to the species of the hadron .",
    "since qcd is flavor independent but the hadrons are not , it is only natural that quark masses which distinguish flavor appear as crucial quantum numbers not only in fixing the scale of the hadronic masses but in determining the choice of the approximation itself .",
    "a relativistic or non - relativistic model is usually invoked depending upon whether the ratio @xmath1 or to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hadronic scale and @xmath4 the quark mass .",
    "it would then appear that the dynamics for light quarks should be largely detemined by @xmath5 and by @xmath4 for heavy flavors .",
    "the case of heavy- light systems would lie somewhere in between .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the question of quark mass dependence in a systematic way .",
    "our analysis is based on the construction of regge trajectories under the the following two hypotheses .",
    "first , we assume all trajectories to be linear in the squared mass ( of the hadronic state ) for all flavours .",
    "( s ) = ( 0)+ s  [ regge ] for light baryons and mesons , we have ample and compelling phenomenological evidence supporting this assumption .",
    "our analysis finds no evidence for strong deviations from linearity also for heavier flavors .",
    "the second assumption is that the functional dependence of the two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 on quark masses is through the combination ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "arguments in support of this hypothesis are presented in * section two*.    in * section three * through an analysis of regge trajectories for mesons of all flavors , we obtain analytic forms for the slope as well as the intercept parameters as a function of ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the `` distances '' between trajectories are also investigated in the same fashion . in * section four * trajectories",
    "are constructed on which physical mesons lie . in * section five *",
    ", we employ their analytic continuation into the space like region to discuss how heavy flavour production is suppressed . the case of d meson trajectory exchange",
    "is analysed in some detail .",
    "our model predictions are compared successfully with available experimental data . in * section six",
    "* we address the implications which our regge trajectories may have on the dynamics underneath .",
    "the decrease in the slope for heavier flavors is argued to imply that the confining potential is strongly flavor dependent .",
    "a non - relativistic potential model exhibiting linear trajectories is constructed where a simple linear dependence on the quark mass ( for the confinement term ) reproduces the appropriate behavior in the slope .",
    "let us consider a meson of mass @xmath10 as a bound state of a quark of mass @xmath11 and an anti - quark of mass @xmath12 .",
    "quite generally , m may be parametrized as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "since quarks have never been observed as free particles , there is no unique definition of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . transcending the bound state dynamics",
    ", this uncertainty further complicates how @xmath15 depends on @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for the constituent quark picture adopted here , we present arguments below in favor of @xmath17 being the relevant parameter upon which @xmath15 depends , for practically all cases where data are available . in some cases , where the dependence on @xmath16 turns out to be small but not negligible ,",
    "it may be incorporated perturbatively .    as a widely accepted convention ,",
    "quarks are considered light if @xmath18 ( u , d , s ) and heavy if @xmath19 ( c , b , t ) , indicating that very different properties arise depending on this scale ( @xmath20 gev ) .",
    "given the above classification for quark masses , there are four types of mesons : ( i ) both quarks are light ; ( ii ) both quarks have the same mass ; ( iii ) one quark is light and the other heavy ; ( iv ) both quarks are heavy . for case ( i ) , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are much smaller than @xmath21 , hence negligible in our scale for all quark masses . for case(ii ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 degenerate into a single parameter . for case ( iii ) , @xmath17 is the only remaining parameter .",
    "hence , the question whether @xmath17 is the dominant parameter is of relevance only for case ( iv ) . for the subclass of ( iv ) which can be described via non - relativistic dynamics , the dependence on @xmath16 ( or , equivalently on the reduced mass ) must by implication be small .",
    "in such cases , it can be included perturbatively .",
    "for the rest of class ( iv ) , the dependence on @xmath16 can not a priori be guaranteed to be small . in practical terms , this may be quite relevant only for the ( @xmath22 ) system , where appreciable differences in masses may occur in parametrizations with or without the inclusion of terms containing @xmath16 .",
    "thus , data on this system would be crucial in distinguishing between the two choices .",
    "all the analysis of the next section will be performed using the @xmath17 variable . without the above justification",
    ", the same choice has also been made in @xcite .",
    "corrections due to electric charge or isospin are not included here .",
    "in this section , we derive analytic forms for the slope and intercept parameters for the regge trajectories for all mesons . for this purpose ,",
    "we use experimental data @xcite as well as results from theoretical models .",
    "theoretical information is required to supplement the experimental one for mesons composed of heavy quarks where only the lowest part of the spectra has been measured .",
    "we selected some models which fit the measured energy levels and predict the masses for higher resonances .",
    "for some states , quark model needs to be invoked to fix the spin @xcite , whenever it has not been determined experimentally .",
    "the spin quantum number being crucial for our analysis , it is essential to verify whether the quark model prediction is confirmed by other independent calculations . as experimental spectra are almost unkown for the b mesons and poorly measured for the d mesons , we do not attempt for them the same detailed analysis as has been done for charmonium and bottomium . for the d system",
    ", only a rough determination of the regge trajectories can be made from experimental data .    while using experimental data , our choice for the quark masses are as follows : m_u = m_d=0.03gev ,   m_s=0.5gev ,   m_c=1.7gev  and   m_b=5gev . while using inputs from theoretical models , values for quark masses",
    "are fixed according to the ones used in the particular model .",
    "let us begin with the slope parameter . in fig.1 input data for the slopes are presented .    for light mesons",
    ", we refer to a recent analysis of regge trajectories in @xcite , and to the mit bag model@xcite which gives the theoretical value for @xmath25 . in this model ,",
    "the bag is supposed to be a rapidly rotating , linearly extended object , where the massless quarks are fixed at the ends ; the slope parameter is obtained through a classical calculation of the energy and angular momentum of the bag .",
    "the four experimental points ( the bullets ) for light mesons , have been determined analyzing leading regge trajectories for systems with different isospin ( along with their quark content ) : i=0 , both @xmath26 ( @xmath27 bound states ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 bound states ) resonances- with slightly different slopes ; i=1 , @xmath16 resonances ; i=1/2 , k resonances . for charmonium",
    ", we calculate the slope parameter using the masses of the two states that have been experimentally measured both for the leading [ @xmath30 and for the second trajectory [ @xmath31 which differ by one unit of spin .",
    "a similar situation is found for bottomium . for both these systems a more complete spectrum",
    "is provided by theoretical models ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we check that an almost linear behaviour is reproduced with the predicted masses for the higher j states . for both systems ,",
    "the calculated slopes are very close to the ones derived from our analysis .",
    "this is not an obvious result because the model predictions for the unkown j states are given in a completely independent way without imposing any linear behaviour .",
    "the theoretical models we analyse are non relativistic potential models ( relativistic correction terms are included by hand ) where a central potential describes the interaction . in @xcite a smooth function interpolating between the coulomb and the linear term fits the spectra .",
    "the other choices for the potential are : @xmath32 for @xcite and @xmath33 for @xcite .",
    "for these three models , the slopes are calculated and included in our analysis .",
    "experimental data for the d and @xmath34 mesons are used to obtain their slope .",
    "predictions from a semirelativistic model in @xcite for the d and b mesons are also included .",
    "all the inputs described above have been used in our analysis and are shown in fig.1 , along with a global fit .",
    "the analytic behaviour for the slope is found to be = gev^-2 [ apt ] an identical analysis has also been carried out for @xmath24 , where the subscript i refers to the leading regge trajectory .",
    "all input data points are shown in fig.2 along with the following analytic expression _",
    "i ( 0)=0.57- [ at ] in fig.2 only two entries ( they refer to the @xmath35 system ) have too small a value compared to the general trend .",
    "we are unable to explain these deviations from the expected behaviour . before concluding this section , we consider some consequences following from our result for the slope parameter , eq.[apt ] .",
    "the 3/2 power implies a rather large value for the kinetic energy possessed by bound state of heavy quarks .",
    "this becomes substantial already for the @xmath35 system , and is certainly so for toponium and top mesons .",
    "unfortunately , mass spectra are completely unkown in the first case @xcite , while top bound states are predicted neither to form , due to the large mass and short life time ( through weak decays ) of the top quark .",
    "presently , it is not possible to verify from data whether such a large kinetic energy term exists .",
    "it must be emphasized that parametrizations which include other quark mass dependences than @xmath9 alone , might change significantly the 3/2 power law .",
    "the accuracy of present data renders difficult such an analysis in terms of more than one combination of the quark masses .    in string",
    "type models @xcite , where the associated kinetic energies are not overly large , @xmath36 would be linear in @xmath37 ( within our assumption that @xmath23 only depends upon @xmath17 ) . hence , we tried to constrain the fit to reproduce this behavior .",
    "a phenomenological problem arises however with the light sector .",
    "since , @xmath38 has a large negative derivative for small @xmath17 , there appear significant variations for the slope in that region . on the other hand ,",
    "we require for all the slopes of the light sector- @xmath39 . such can be obtained only with an almost perfect degeneracy in the u , d and s quark masses .",
    "we hope to return to this interesting but delicate question elsewhere .",
    "below we continue our analysis with the unconstrained fit , eq.[apt ] , which reproduces the observed fall off in the slope quite well .",
    "let us now consider the spacing between the first and successive trajectories for various mesons .",
    "this distance is defined to be the energy squared gap between states of fixed j for successive trajectories , @xmath41 ^ 2-[e^{i}_{j}]^2 $ ] .",
    "we also analyse the corresponding energy level splitting @xmath41-[e^{i}_{j}]$ ] .",
    "there is phenomenological evidence suggesting that successive trajectories alternate between states of normal and abnormal parity .",
    "that is , the first trajectory contains the normal set starting with @xmath42 , followed by the abnormal set with @xmath43 , and so on . in particular , lowest j=1 states for any meson @xcite has negative parity . as energy increases , we encounter a state of positive parity , followed by a negative parity state and so on .",
    "this trend is summerized in table i.     state & p&state&p & state&p & state&p + @xmath44&-&@xmath45&+&@xmath46 and @xmath47 & - & ? & + + @xmath48 & -&@xmath49&+&@xmath50&- & ? & + + @xmath51 & -&@xmath52&+&@xmath53 & - & @xmath54 & + + @xmath55&-&@xmath56&+&@xmath57&- & ? & + + @xmath58&-&@xmath59&+ & ? & - & ? & + + @xmath60 & -&@xmath61&+ & ? & - & ? & + + @xmath62 & -&@xmath63&+&@xmath64 and @xmath65&- & ? & + + @xmath66 & -&@xmath67&+&@xmath68&-&@xmath69 & + +    table i : _ spectrum of spin one states .",
    "_    exceptions to this regularity are present and we discuss them briefly in the following . for example , for the omega resonances , we have two closely lying states , @xmath70 and the @xmath71 , which have both been assigned negative parity .",
    "a similar situation is found for the charmonium states , @xmath72 and @xmath65 states .",
    "another possible exception concerns the @xmath73 , @xmath42 state , which was observed but not reconfirmed .",
    "in fact this state is omitted from summary table , even if reported in @xcite .",
    "if such a state did exist , it would be out of the scheme presented above .",
    "on the other hand , for k mesons the situation is extremely regular .",
    "first three states follow this pattern",
    ". then somewhat doubtful k(1650 ) of positive parity is followed by @xmath74 of negative parity .",
    "this last entry is not shown in the previous table for lack of space .    as can be seen in table i ,",
    "data are scarce for d mesons . in any case , the known states follow the regular pattern and we have included them in our analysis .",

    "apart from these possible exceptions , the alternating behaviour between normal and abnormal sets of regge trajectories seem to be confirmed .",
    "in fig.3 , energy splitting and the energy squared gap between spin one states from columns i and ii of table i are plotted as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "no input from theoretical models are available since only normal states were considered there .    as a general behaviour , in fig.3 energy splitting seems to be almost constant around 0.4 gev for all existing mesons , while energy squared increases .",
