    ".    in general ma appears as the first lesson for diabetic retinopathy .",
    "reliable detection of ma has major importnace for diabetics screening purpose . in color fundus images ma appears as small red dots with very small radius less than that of the major optic vain . in reality",
    "these are tiny swollen capillaries in the retina , can discharge blood leading to other pathological symtoms such as exudates , heamorrhages etc . various challenges such as vessels bifurcations and crossing , illumination and contrast changes , artifacts , degradation of image due to imageing device setup etc",
    ". appears in automatic fundus image based dr screening system .",
    "ma detection is a well investigated research area for dr mass screening system .",
    "our motivation of these works is to present a new method to detect ma under different challenging situation and to achieve high sensitivity and specificity .",
    "[ fig : over ] depicts typical retinal image with pathological features such as microaneurysms , exudates etc and non - pathological features such as the optic disc , the macula etc .",
    "complexity of ma detection can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : over ] .",
    "most of the ma detection works presented till now have common pipeline of three to four stages ; first prepocessing the image , secondly manual feature extraction followed by classification and a postprocessing step . also the use of high contrast green channel of the fundus image is very common in ma detection research . in general exisiting methods used morphological method , filtering based and supervised classification using hand crafted features etc .",

    "@xcite had developed ensemble - based microaneurysms detection system and claimed first prize in roc online challege and also achieved good result on other dataset .",

    "@xcite microanurysms was detected using rotating cross section profiles based method which depends on cicularity and diameter of mas .",
    "for each profiles peak was detected and features such as size , height and shape was calculated .    in this work , we propose a deep learning based pixel wise ma classification method invariant to luminane , contrast changes and artifacts .",
    "no image based preprocessing or feature extraction stages is required .",
    "in addition to that this method perforamnce independent on vessel structures , the optic disc and the fovea . hence extraction or detection of these features",

    "we have achieved state - of - the - art performance with very low flase positive rate on publicly available datasets .",
    "microanerysms ( ma ) usually follow a guassian like intensity distribution and have isolated structures from neighbours . to detect this tiny structures",
    "a pixel based deep neural network ( dnn ) @xcite is developed .",
    "pixel based classification is useful for this type of complex detection .",
    "every pixel of a image is classified as ma or non - ma . for any given pixel , class label",

    "an overview of the method has been depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : algo ] .          because of local maximum structures of ma ; rest of pixels of the window centered on that pixel need to be processed efficiently to get high classification probability . for account of this effect input data",
    "was modified by using two techniques for neighbouring data supression , specifically foveation and nonuniform sampling .",
    "the concept of foveation orginated from uneven size and organization of photo - receptive cells and ganglions in the human eye .",
    "visual acuity is maximum at the middle of the retina termed as fovea and decreases towards periphery of the retina .",
    "foveation proved to ve very effective in nonlocal means denoising algorithms @xcite . in foveation central section of the window",

    "standard deivation of gaussian blur kernels increases with distance from central section .",
    "+ it has been observed that increasing input window size in dnn improves performance significantly , but at the same time computational complexity also increases .",
    "nonuniform sampling was used to selectively depreciate window pixels towards periphery . only central section of input window",
    "is smapled at full resolution , while smapling resolution decreases towards periphery . using this method large window",

    "we have incorporated dropout [ ] training algorithm for three convolutional layers and one fully connected hidden layer . and",
    "maxout activation function is used for all layers in the network except the softmax layer .      the convolutional layer @xcite is the core building block of a deep neural network parameterized by the input volume size @xmath0 , the receptive filed or filter size @xmath1 , the depth of conv layer @xmath2 and the stride or skipping factor @xmath3 .",

    "windows with a ma pixel at the center is consided as ma smaples and that of with non - ma consided for non - ma samples for training .",
    "moreover to reduce overfitting and to ensure rotational invariance the most common method is to enlarge the dataset using random rotations and using horizontal reflections for border pixels .",
