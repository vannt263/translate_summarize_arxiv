    "the uniform thickness of a knotted curve is the radius of the largest tubular neighborhood around the curve without intersections of the normal discs .",

    "uniform thickness has been studied extensively in several articles including [ bs ] g. buck and j. simon , [ cks ] j. cantarella , r. b. kusner , and j. m. sullivan , [ di ] y. diao , [ d1 , d2 , d3 ] o. c. durumeric , [ gl ]  o. gonzales and r. de la llave , [ gm ]  o. gonzales and h. maddocks , [ ka ]  v. katrich , j. bendar , d. michoud , r.g .",

    "@xmath11    in this article , we study a ball - model to describe nonuniform thickness , which allows a nonuniform distribution of the strength of the forces along a curve in the euclidean space .",
    "this model can help us to understand the local shape of large polymers which do not have a uniform structure .",
    "most of the results of this article are true for surfaces or submanifolds of @xmath0 , but the results about the focal points are qualitative and the proofs are detailed . in order to have explicit expressions for the behavior and location of the singular ( focal ) points , and to be able to obtain the rigidity in theorem 2 , we concentrated on the curves in the euclidean space . even though our motivation comes from examples in @xmath4 all results",
    "are stated and proved in @xmath0 since our proofs are independent of the dimension of the ambient space , and they do not simplify for @xmath12 @xmath13 in our model , a curve @xmath2  is a union of finitely many disjoint closed curves and it is furnished with a weight function @xmath14 the nonuniform @xmath15tubular neighborhood @xmath16 is the union of metric balls of radius @xmath17 centered at each @xmath18 as @xmath19 increases , the size of these balls increase at fixed rate at each point , but the rate differs from point to point of @xmath20 this model is different from the disc - model which allows the growth of the normal discs at different rates .",
    "one of the reasons that we chose to investigate the ball - model is that the physical forces , such as electrical and magnetic forces have effects in every direction rather than being restricted to chosen planes .",
    "furthermore , the ball - model can be investigated more thoroughly , since there is a natural potential function , @xmath21    [ ptb ]    we study the problem by using distance function methods from riemannian geometry . throughout the article , we use the squared @xmath22distance functions @xmath23 .",

    "the second derivatives become negative immediately after the focal points as @xmath19 increases . therefore , a line normal to @xmath2 is never minimizing the distance to @xmath2 past a focal point , and the exponential map can not be injective past a focal point .",

    "since there is a quadratic term @xmath39 in the second derivative of the restriction of @xmath40 to @xmath41 points with zero second derivatives can be isolated away from the set of points with negative second derivatives . as a result , there are some cases with an exponential map which is a homeomorphism within the injectivity radius but not a diffeomorphism . in other words , the injectivity radius can be larger than the @xmath22distance to first focal points . as a consequence , we need to modify the notion of injectivity radius .",
