    "the total number of @xmath20 plaquettes is denoted @xmath42 using @xmath43 we define the average density @xmath44 in statistical mechanics , @xmath45 would be the free energy density multiplied by @xmath7 and @xmath46 the energy density .",

    "these three solutions have matrices of second derivatives with eigenvalues of opposite signs and correspond to saddle points rather than minimum or maximum . in the three cases @xmath72 .    for general @xmath2 ,",
    "it is clear that we can always find at least one group element @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is an absolute minimum . in particular , for @xmath2 even , @xmath75 is such a group element , with @xmath76 ( the individual matrix elements must have a complex norm less then one ) . for @xmath77 and",

    "this solution ( the element of the center the closest to @xmath81 ) gives an absolute minimum of @xmath51 for @xmath5 and we conjecture that it is also the case for larger @xmath2 .",
    "we can now obtain an absolute minimum of the action if we can build a configuration such that @xmath82 takes its absolute minimum value for every plaquette .",
    "this can be accomplished by the following construction . in the appendix",
    ", we show that ( at least for for @xmath83 ) and for @xmath41 even , it is possible to construct a set of lines on the lattice such that every plaquette shares _ one and only one _ link with this set of lines .",

    "it is useful to make the following ( gauge invariant ) argument : in order to have an absolute minimum of the action , for every @xmath91 plaquette @xmath33 , the product @xmath92 of the @xmath31 along @xmath33 starting at any site @xmath93 of @xmath33 , is a nontrivial element of the center . under a local gauge transformation , @xmath94 since @xmath92 commutes with any @xmath0 matrix .",
    "for the same reason , changing @xmath95 along the plaquette amounts to a @xmath96 conjugation and has no effect on the center .",
    "consequently , configurations with a different set of @xmath97 are not gauge equivalent .",
    "one can think of @xmath98 as a set of electric and magnetic field configurations .    for @xmath22 ,",
    "there is only one , uniform , set @xmath98 where all the elements @xmath99 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "this can be realized in 4 different ways by putting @xmath81 on the 4 distinct sets @xmath84 .",
    "these 4 configurations are all gauge equivalent .",
    "the gauge transformations that map these 4 configurations into each others can be obtained by taking @xmath100 on every other sites of the lines of @xmath84 . for @xmath89 , it is also possible to show that the 8 configurations that can be constructed with a similar procedure can also be shown to be gauge equivalent .",
    "the gauge transformation can be obtained by taking @xmath100 on every other sites of the lines of @xmath84 pointing in two particular directions and in such way that one half of the lines created by the gauge transformation associated with one direction `` annihilate '' with one half of the lines created by the gauge transformation associated with the other direction .",
    "we conjecture that in higher dimensions , the configurations that minimize the action for @xmath22 are also related by gauge transformations .",
    "for @xmath23 the situation is quite different because for every link of a particular @xmath84 , we have two possible nontrivial element of the center .",
    "since there are @xmath101 plaquettes on a @xmath40 lattice and one link of @xmath84 per plaquette , shared by @xmath102 plaquette , we have @xmath103 links in any @xmath84 . picking a particular @xmath84 ,",
    "it possible to construct @xmath104 distinct @xmath98 . consequently , there are at least @xmath104 gauge inequivalent minima of the action for @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath104 always is an integer for @xmath41 even , which has been assumed . in the case",
    "@xmath105 , the degeneracy is simply @xmath106 which is the same as the number of configurations of an ising model on a @xmath107 lattice .    in summary , we predict a discontinuity in @xmath46 as @xmath6 changes sign . in the limit @xmath50 , we have @xmath108 , while in the limit @xmath48 , we expect @xmath109 for @xmath2 even , and @xmath110 for @xmath2 odd .",
    "in this section we discuss @xmath22 gauge theories at negative @xmath7 .",
    "the basic idea is that it is possible to change @xmath111 into @xmath112 by making the _ change of variables _",
    "@xmath113 for every link @xmath30 of a particular @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath81 is an element of @xmath22 and since the haar measure is invariant under left or right multiplication by a group element , this does not affect the measure of integration .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath114 taking the logarithmic derivative as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdef ] ) , we obtain @xmath115 this identity can be seen in the symmetry of the curve @xmath116 shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : pp2 ] ) can be further checked by calculating the difference @xmath117 which should be zero except for statistical fluctuations .",
    "[ fig : pdelta ] illustrates this statement and shows that the statistical errors of our calculations are of order @xmath118 or less .",

    "( [ eq : pp2 ] ) together with the assumption that @xmath122 , is in agreement with the statement made in section [ sec : limit ] that @xmath46 seen as a function of @xmath123 , jumps discontinuously by 2 as @xmath6 becomes negative .",
    "this invalidates the idea that @xmath46 could have a regular expansion about @xmath124 with a non - zero radius of convergence .",
    "this relation can also be used in the opposite limit and expanded about @xmath125 .",
    "the odd terms cancel automatically .",
    "the even terms of order 2 and higher add and can not cancel .",
    "consequently , the even coefficients of the strong coupling expansion of @xmath116 and the odd coefficients of the free energy should vanish , in agreement with explicit calculations @xcite .",
    "the discontinuity at @xmath124 can be extended to wilson loops of odd area ( in plaquette units ) .",
    "to see this , let us consider a wilson loop @xmath126 with @xmath127 a contour that is the boundary of an area made out of @xmath24 plaquettes . for simplicity ,",
    "let also assume that this area is connected and has no self - intersections . under the change of variables @xmath113 for every link @xmath30 of an arbitrary set @xmath84 , we have @xmath128 .",
    "this follows from the fact that for any line , the parity of the number of links of @xmath127 shared with this line , is the same as the number of plaquettes of the area in contact with this lines .",
    "since @xmath84 shares a link with every plaquette , we obtain the desired result .",
    "this can be summarized as @xmath129    we can now try to interpret the change of the wilson loop with the area in a term of a potential .",
    "we consider a rectangular @xmath130 contour @xmath127 and write @xmath131 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : parity ] ) this implies @xmath132 this property can be related to the fact that the configurations of minimum action are invariant under translations by two lattice spacings but not under translations by one lattice spacing .",
    "this also confirms our expectation that the hamiltonian develops a nonhermitian part .",
    "for @xmath5 , @xmath81 is _ not _ a group element and the closest thing to the change of variables used for @xmath4 that we can invent is a multiplication by a nontrivial element of the center @xmath133 for the links of a particular set @xmath84 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath134 in the case @xmath4 , @xmath135 is replaced by -1 , @xmath136 becomes 1 and we recover eq .",
    "( [ eq : su2id ] ) . in the case of @xmath23 ,",
    "the factor @xmath136 prevents us from deriving an exact identity analog to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp2 ] ) for @xmath22 .",
    "it is however possible to obtain an approximate generalization which is a good approximation for small @xmath7 . setting @xmath137 , taking the logarithmic derivative with respect to @xmath138 and setting @xmath139",
    ", we obtain @xmath140 taking the real part and using @xmath141 , we obtain @xmath142 which can be seen as an approximate @xmath23 version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp2 ] ) .",
    "the cancellation of the terms of order 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 occurs independently of the values of the coefficients at these orders .",
    "the absence of contribution of order 3 and the presence of a nonzero contribution at order 6 comes from the fact @xcite that @xmath143 has a zero ( nonzero ) contribution at order 4 ( 7 ) .",
    "as it does not seem possible to obtain @xmath116 for @xmath7 real and negative from our knowledge at @xmath7 real and positive , we have to resort to a direct numerical approach .",

    "our best estimate of the critical @xmath7 for this volume is -22.09 . the first initial configuration was completely ordered ( in the @xmath146 sense , with @xmath46=1.5 ) by putting a nontrivial element of the center on a set of lines @xmath84 . as we set @xmath147",
