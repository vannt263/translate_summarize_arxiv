    "around 1953 , g. i. taylor @xcite published a series of papers in which he studies the dispersion of particles injected in a poiseuille flow through a cylindrical tube .",
    "as the particles are carried along , their elution profile broadens along the flow axis @xmath0 into a co - moving gaussian shape , with a mean square displacement described by an effective diffusive law , @xmath1 ^ 2 \\rangle=2 kt $ ] .",
    "he calculated the value of the `` taylor dispersion coefficient '' : @xmath2 , a result also obtained by westhaver in his study of electro - migration @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the suspended particles , @xmath4 the average flow velocity and @xmath5 the radius of the tube . as an application",
    ", he discusses how such a set - up allows to estimate @xmath3 , which is typically very small , by measuring @xmath6 , a method used routinely in biophysics by now @xcite .",
    "the catch is that the gaussian regime is attained for times larger than the typically very long time @xmath7 for the particles to diffuse over the tube s radius .",
    "the dispersion of particles in a flow is one example of a more general phenomenon , referred to as generalized taylor dispersion , which we briefly review below , and which includes applications in chromatography , the sedimentation of non - spherical particles , spin relaxation and phase diffusion in limit cycles , models for kinetic theory , random evolution , etc . @xcite .",
    "after pioneering work by h.  cramer and i.  n.  sanov , the mathematical theory of large deviations was primarily shaped in a series of influential papers by m.  d.  donsker and s.  r.  s.  varadhan @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen an ever increasing number of studies of large deviations in statistical mechanics , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the gaussian distribution as it appears in taylor s problem corresponds to the quadratic approximation for the so - called large deviation function ( ldf ) .",
    "the explicit evaluation of the ldf for taylor dispersion was done in @xcite and provides a more precise description of the large time regime .",
    "but , as we will show in the present paper , the connection between both problems runs deeper : the large deviation description for generalized taylor dispersion can be mapped onto that for empirical distributions .",
    "the empirical distribution is the probability distribution observed in a sample realization of a stochastic process .",
    "it plays a crucial role in statistics and its properties form a cornerstone of large deviation theory proper .",
    "the connection between taylor dispersion and empirical distributions allows to compare and exchange techniques and results between both fields of research .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : gen ] we shortly review generalized taylor dispersion and explicitly establish the relation to the theory of empirical distributions .",
    "we then turn in section [ sec : disc ] to the large deviation analysis of taylor dispersion in layered systems for which the underlying stochastic process acts in a discrete state space . in section [ sec : cont ] we discuss continuous flow fields including the poisieulle flow studied originally by taylor .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "to set the scene , we start with a brief review of generalized taylor dispersion . a variable @xmath0 has a rate of change @xmath8 , which is driven by a stochastic process @xmath9 , independent of @xmath0 : @xmath10 in the example described in the introduction , @xmath0 is the coordinate measured along the tube , @xmath11 is the radial position of the particle undergoing molecular diffusion , and @xmath12 the flow profile , cf .",
    "[ fig : comparison]a . by integrating the equation of motion ,",
    "one finds the relation between the sample position @xmath13 at time @xmath14 , and the particular realisation @xmath15 $ ] , of the stochastic process : @xmath16 we will assume that the stochastic process @xmath9 is stationary , with stationary distribution @xmath17 , and does not display long - time correlations . the resulting displacement @xmath0",
    "will , for long times , be the sum of essentially uncorrelated and identically distributed contributions , corresponding to subsequent displacements during time intervals larger than the correlation time of @xmath9 .",
    "hence one expects from the central limit theorem that the distribution for @xmath0 approaches a gaussian in the long time limit : @xmath18 with the average speed @xmath19 and the taylor dispersion coefficient given by a green - kubo formula : @xmath20 [ u(\\bold{y}(0))-\\bar{u } ] \\rangle d\\tau.\\ ] ]    the large deviation analysis of generalized taylor dispersion builds on the well studied large deviation properties of the empirical density of the underlying stochastic process @xcite . to make the connection explicit let us consider the case in which the rate of change @xmath21 of the coordinate @xmath0 depends on a discrete variable @xmath22 , rather then the continuous variable @xmath9 discussed before , cf .",
    "[ fig : comparison]b .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eqm ] ) , is thus replaced by @xmath23 .",
    "the discrete state @xmath24 undergoes an independent stationary stochastic process with steady state distribution @xmath25 . during a realization of the stochastic process of duration @xmath14",
    ", the system will spend relative times @xmath26 in each of the states @xmath22 .",
    "the object , @xmath27 , called the empirical density and itself a random variable , is to be distinguished from the `` genuine '' distribution @xmath28 . nevertheless , for an ergodic process @xmath29 will converge to @xmath30 in the long - time limit .",
    "more precisely , one finds for large @xmath14 @xmath31 with the ldf @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , deviations of @xmath29 from @xmath30 are exponentially suppressed in the long - time limit .    instead of considering the sample displacement at time @xmath14 , @xmath13",
    ", we now focus on the sample velocity @xmath36 , which is clearly given by : @xmath37 this expression links the stochastic properties of @xmath38 to those of the empirical distribution @xmath29 . in particular , the large time properties of the sample speed are specified by a large deviation principle of the form @xmath39 with the ldf @xmath40 linked to @xmath32 by the contraction principle of large deviation theory @xcite : @xmath41 this property corresponds to the intuitively obvious observation that an exponentially rare sample speed @xmath38 is realised by the least unlikely , exponentially rare realisation of an empirical distribution @xmath29 .",
    "we have explicitly included the constraint that @xmath29 is normalized , @xmath42 .",
    "note that the central limit approximation , cf .",
    "( [ clt ] ) , corresponds to the quadratic approximation of the ldf around its minimum , @xmath43 whereas the exact large deviation function will have contributions of higher order in @xmath38 .    to proceed , we will assume that the stochastic process @xmath24 is markovian , and represents an equilibrium situation .",
    "this covers most applications in generalized taylor dispersion .",
    "the markov process is characterized by a transition matrix @xmath44 .",
    "its elements are the rates @xmath45 , corresponding to the probability per unit time to make a transition from state @xmath46 to state @xmath24 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "they obey the detailed balance property : @xmath49 in this case , the ldf of the empirical distribution is known explicitly @xcite : @xmath50 to account for the constraints in the contraction we introduce two lagrange multipliers @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the vector @xmath53 minimizing @xmath54 has to fulfill the system of linear equations : @xmath55 multiplying by @xmath56 and summing over @xmath24 yields : @xmath57 so all that needs to be determined are the values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in general there will be several solutions . to select the proper one it is instructive to write in matrix form : @xmath58 showing that @xmath51 is an eigenvalue of the symmetric @xmath59 matrix @xmath60 with elements @xmath61 , with all entries of the corresponding eigenvector positive .",
    "hence , by the frobenius - perron theorem , the largest eigenvalue of @xmath62 is the relevant solution for the lagrange multiplier @xmath51 .    as a first application of the above formalism and to demonstrate its consistency with previous work , we rederive the exact expression and bounds for the taylor dispersion coefficient @xmath6 . in order to capture the gaussian regime",
    "we only need the quadratic expansion of the ldf @xmath40 around the most probable sample value at @xmath63 , cf .",
    "( [ clti ] ) . starting from",
    "we derive in appendix [ sec : a ] the general expression @xcite @xmath64 here @xmath65 denotes the inverse of @xmath45 on the subspace of non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "it is usually difficult if not impossible to evaluate this inverse exactly . as an alternative , the variational form of invites for the derivation of bounds on @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 it suffices to keep the first order deviations @xmath68 in ( [ lded ] ) before doing the contraction . in this way",
    "we show in appendix [ sec : a ] @xmath69 where we used the scalar product @xmath70 and @xmath71 is any vector perpendicular to @xmath72 and fulfilling @xmath73 .",
    "this expression is identical to the lower bound for @xmath6 derived previously in @xcite .",
    "turning to the large deviation properties , we first focus on the simplest model capturing the essential ingredients of taylor dispersion .",
    "it consists of just two layers with velocities @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . because of galilei invariance we may choose @xmath76 without loss of generality .",
    "we denote by @xmath77 and @xmath78 the rates of transition from layer @xmath79 to @xmath80 and back , respectively . in this case",

    "the ldf @xmath40 follows directly from because the two constraints @xmath84 and @xmath85 already uniquely fix @xmath53 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the contraction becomes trivial : @xmath86 this result can , of course , also be obtained directly from the large - time limit of . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2-layer model sedimentation t1 ] we exemplarily compare the exact solution , with the gaussian approximation , and the large - deviation result .",

    "are also results of numerical simulations using the gillespie algorithm .",
    "as expected the large - deviation expression is superior to the gaussian approximation for reproducing the tails of the distribution and follows the exact result down to rather low probabilities .",

    "plugging the result into the two constraints results in two equations for @xmath89 and @xmath90 from which @xmath40 is determined via .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , we focus on the simple case of constant upward and downward rates given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 for all @xmath24 ( with however boundary rates @xmath93 ) , and consider the simple linear shear flow profile @xmath94 fig .  [",
    "fig : n - layer model sedimentation t1 ] demonstrates the accuracy of the large deviation approach also for this system . as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2-layer model sedimentation t1 ] the ldf compares very well with the simulation results and is clearly superior to the gaussian approximation .",
    "the failure of the latter is again particularly prominent for asymmetric transition rates @xmath95 .",
    "this situation models a horizontal layered system in which taylor dispersion is affected by sedimentation .",
    "furthermore , the non - gaussian deviations become stronger when the number of layers @xmath87 increases .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that particles have more options to get stuck in slow or fast lanes .",
    "we now return to the case of a continuous variable  @xmath9 instead of the discrete index @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath96 represents a stochastic process with detailed balance we may again build on explicit expressions for the ldf of the empirical density . more precisely , let the dynamics of @xmath9 be given by the stratonovich langevin equation @xmath97 with a deterministic drift derived from a potential @xmath98 and a gaussian noise source with zero mean and correlations @xmath99 .",
    "the large deviation functional for the empirical density ( cf .  )",
    "@xmath100 is then given by @xcite : @xmath101=\\int   d(\\bold{y})\\ , p(\\bold{y } )           \\left(\\nabla\\sqrt{\\frac{q(\\bold{y})}{p(\\bold{y})}}\\right)^2 d\\bold{y},\\ ] ] where , as before , @xmath17 denotes the stationary distribution of the process . in appendix",
    "[ sec : b ] we include a simple derivation of this expression from for the special case of a biased random walk in one dimension .",
    "starting with the contraction to @xmath40 is now defined by the variational problem @xmath102 under the constraints @xmath103 it is convenient to minimize in @xmath104 . introducing as before the lagrange multipliers @xmath89 and @xmath90 the corresponding euler - lagrange equation reads @xmath105 where at the boundary the normal component of @xmath106 has to vanish .",
    "multiplying by @xmath107 , integrating over @xmath108 , and using the boundary condition gives back .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "form a sturm - liouville problem , its concrete solution depends on the flow profile @xmath109 .",
    "note that for @xmath110 independent of @xmath111 , which is the case in many physical applications , the large deviation function becomes proportional to @xmath3 . for the original problem of taylor dispersion in a poiseuille flow through a cylindrical tube one can , by a choice of the units of time and space , furthermore set @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "hence the corresponding large deviation function @xmath40 divided by @xmath3 reduces to a single master function , which we proceed to calculate below .",
    "starting with @xmath114const .",
    "and @xmath115 acquires the form @xmath116 due to rotational symmetry the solution of this equation will depend only on @xmath117 and it is sufficient to keep the radial part of the laplacian .",
    "we hence have to solve @xmath118 together with the boundary conditions @xmath119 this eigenvalue problem was also obtained in @xcite ( their eq .",
    "( 3.28 ) ) .",
    "the auxiliary function @xmath120 introduced in this paper is hence nothing but the square root @xmath121 of the empirical density .",
    "the general solution of may be written as @xmath122 with the kummer functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 @xcite , two constants @xmath125 and @xmath126 as well as @xmath127 the first part of involving @xmath123 obeys the first boundary condition , at @xmath128 , automatically .",
    "because of the behaviour of @xmath129 for small @xmath130 this boundary condition can not be fulfilled by the second part of implying @xmath131 .",
    "the second boundary condition , at @xmath132 , and the two constraints then form a system of equations to determine @xmath125 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . from",

    "in particular the asymmetry of the distribution , which in this case is due to the circular geometry of the setup , and which is clearly beyond the capabilities of the gaussian approximation is accurately reproduced .",
    "[ fig : poiseuille]b displays the function @xmath134 for different values of @xmath38 that highlights which regions in the cross section of the pipe contribute most to the respective large deviations of the sample velocity . as intuitive small velocities require long residence of the particles near the wall whereas large values of @xmath38 are realized by particles staying most of the time near the centre of the tube .",
    "the inset shows the universal function @xmath133 for taylor dispersion in poiseuille flow .",
    "note that both curves are independent of @xmath14 .",
    "we discussed the connection between the large deviation properties of taylor dispersion and the empirical measure of the underlying stochastic process .",
    "the large deviation function @xmath40 provides an accurate long - time characterization of particle separation in shear flows .",
    "in particular for biased transport perpendicular to the flow direction the gaussian approximation was found to yield a rather poor description only whereas the large deviation function reproduces the actual distribution down to very small probabilities .",
    "we conclude with a discussion about a converse issue , namely the interest and relevance of taylor dispersion for the theory of large deviations .",
    "first , results from taylor dispersion can feedback into the theory of empirical distributions .",
    "an example is the exact solution for the dispersion in a general nearest neighbour random walk @xcite , which can be translated back into an exact expression for the correlations of the empirical distribution .",
    "second , we note that the ldf @xmath40 , albeit obtained via contraction from the ldf @xmath135 , is in fact a functional of the velocity field @xmath136 . hence ,",
    "if we know @xmath137 for a suitable chosen set of flow profiles @xmath136 we can in principle reconstruct @xmath32 .",
    "third , as far as experiments are concerned , taylor dispersion provides a rather direct way to measure the empirical distribution .",
    "if the transition matrix governing the @xmath108-dynamics can be modified experimentally , e.g. , by applying appropriate biasing fields between the states , the results of this `` tilt '' will be promptly seen in the particle dispersion along the flow .",
    "here we give a short account on how our results for the large deviation function @xmath40 of taylor dispersion relates to results for the taylor dispersion coefficient @xmath6 derived previously . since @xmath6 describes the gaussian long time regime of the process it is determined by the second derivative of @xmath40 at @xmath66 : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is given by ( cf .  )",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath141 is determined by @xmath142 then , since @xmath143 , @xmath144 from the constraints @xmath145 and @xmath146 we find by differentiation with resprect to @xmath38 @xmath147 hence , together with , it follows @xmath148 and the second term in vanishes .",
    "therefore @xmath149 using the detailed balance condition @xmath150 we find from @xmath151 and therefore @xmath152    to determine @xmath153 at @xmath66 we take the derivative of with respect to @xmath38 to find @xmath154 since @xmath155 is a homogeneous function of @xmath156 , @xmath157 , we have @xmath158 and , for @xmath159 , @xmath160 reproducing .",
    "this implies @xmath161 on the other hand , multiplying by @xmath162 and summing over @xmath24 gives @xmath163 such that @xmath164 therefore @xmath165 from we hence obtain @xmath166 or , using , @xmath167 this is a system of linear inhomogeneous equations to determine @xmath153 at @xmath66 in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath168 .",
    "the matrix @xmath45 is singular , however , by definition of @xmath169 , the r.h.s of is orthogonal to the left eigenvector @xmath170 corresponding to the zero eigenvalue and the system is hence solvable .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 the inverse of @xmath45 on the subspace orthogonal to the zero eigenvector to get @xmath171 plugging this result into we find the well - known expression @xcite @xmath172    in addition to this exact expression for @xmath6 the variational form of the contraction forms a convenient starting point to derive bounds on @xmath6 . from",
    "we see that a galilei transformation @xmath173 does not change @xmath6 . in the following we therefore assume for simplicity @xmath174 .",
    "small deviations @xmath38 from @xmath174 result from small deviations of @xmath175 from @xmath72 .",
    "if we parametrize these deviations by @xmath176 and use the detailed balance condition we find @xmath177 which , using and , yields @xmath178 here the infimum has to be taken under the constraints @xmath179 and @xmath180 .    as an interesting trial ansatz , we set @xmath181 .",
    "then the first constraint is automatically satisfied while the second implies @xmath182 this gives @xmath183 the equality sign is realized for a kangaroo process defined by @xmath184 , where @xmath185 denotes the overall relaxiation time .",
    "indeed one finds in this case that the infimum in is realized for @xmath186 .",
    "hence for a kangaroo process with @xmath174 we get the simple result @xmath187 finally , using @xmath188 we may rewrite in the form @xmath189 where the infimum is now over all vectors @xmath71 orthogonal to the stationary distribution @xmath190 and fulfilling @xmath73 . here , the scalar product is defined by @xmath191 the bound @xmath192 resulting from was already derived in @xcite .",
