    "disk galaxies like the milky way are long - lived systems , evolving ( in the absence of interactions ) only on timescales of several orbits .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) also evolves slowly overall , such that there are well - defined ism properties when averaged over a spatial domain of several disk scale heights and several tenths of an orbit . on small spatial scales , however , the ism is highly structured , and can change rapidly as both thermal and dynamical timescales are short .",
    "these short timescales suggest that the ism will be able to evolve to a quasi - equilibrium state , in which heating balances cooling , and in which the mean pressure in the diffuse gas at any height balances the weight of the overlying ism .",
    "the ideas that thermal and vertical `` hydrostatic '' equilibrium should approximately apply are widely held and have been studied in detail over many decades in the astrophysical literature .",

    "many processes may contribute to turbulent driving , but those associated with feedback from young stars are likely to be the most important on scales relevant for vertical dynamical equilibrium within the disk .",
    "similar to the case for thermal pressure , empirical measures of the supernova rate have often been used to obtain predictions for the turbulent pressure in ism models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we also vary the heating efficiency @xmath9 that connects the heating rate and the sfr surface density .",
    "this allows us to explore how e.g. varying dust abundance ( which would alter radiation penetration and heating ) may affect the saturated state and evolution .",
    "as we shall describe , our simulations show that realistic star formation rates are obtained when momentum feedback at the levels expected from the corresponding type ii supernova rates are included .",
    "this affirms the conclusions reached in our previous numerical studies ( paper  i , so12 ) .",

    "first , the feedback from sn explosions is realized solely via expanding sn remnants rather than injecting thermal energy , which would create a hot ism @xcite .",
    "more realistically , the hot ism would occupy a significant volume even near the midplane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , together with the cold and warm phases in approximate pressure equilibrium .",
    "due to its large scale height , however , most of the hot gas does not participate in supporting the weight of the warm / cold diffuse gas , although expansion of highly overpressured hot sn remnants is crucial in driving turbulence within the surrounding warm / cold ism ; we model the latter effect . based on our conclusion that the sfr is regulated by midplane total pressure ( section [ sec : scaling ] )",
    ", we believe that our main findings are robust , in spite of our simplified treatment of sne .",
    "we note that using preliminary simulations in which sne are modeled with thermal energy input ( rather than momentum input ) , we recover similar results for sfrs to those reported here .",
    "a second caveat is that the feedback we apply is instantaneous , whereas a more realistic treatment of stellar evolution would include inputs from stellar winds and expanding regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prior to sn explosions .",
    "since sne are the most powerful driving source of turbulence averaged over the ism ( @xmath85 for stellar winds and expanding regions would be an order of magnitude lower than that of sne ; see os11 ) , we believe that the current simplified approach is an adequate first approximation for modeling sfr self - regulation in diffuse - dominated regions .",
    "feedback from earlier stages of massive star evolution would , however , affect the detailed properties and lifetimes of gravitationally - bound clouds ( gbcs ) , so including these effects will be important in modeling higher-@xmath2 galactic regions where most of the ism mass is in gbcs rather than diffuse structures .",
    "for this reason , we confine ourselves here to the regime @xmath86 in which the observed ism is predominantly in the diffuse atomic component .",
    "when spiral arms or bars are taken into account , the time delay between the epochs of star formation and feedback would likely also be important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is presumably because the total mass swept up by an expanding shell is larger in 3d models ( spherical volume @xmath155 ) than in xz models ( cylindrical volume @xmath156 for @xmath157 ) .",
    "although the feedback is normalized for the xz models such that the injected momentum is the same as for 3d models ( see paper  i ) , the resulting turbulent velocities at high @xmath153 are smaller in 3d because the larger swept - up mass in 3d reduces the mean velocity at large @xmath153 .",
