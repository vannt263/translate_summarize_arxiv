    "tidal interactions between galaxies in a cluster are expected to be frequent and may induce structural changes in the disturbed galaxies .",
    "for example , numerical simulations by moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) indicate that fast tidal encounters produce harassed   looking galaxies , reminiscent of the distorted spirals in clusters at a redshift of @xmath2 0.4 as observed by the hubble space telescope .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of galaxies in a cluster ( e.g. roos & norman 1979 , see dressler 1984 for a review ) suggest that these tidal encounters cause galaxies to loose a substantial fraction , @xmath3 per cent , of their stars to the cluster potential where they are left free to roam as intergalactic tidal debris .",
    "zwicky ( 1951 ) associated excess light he had observed between the galaxies in coma with such debris from tidal interactions .",
    "subsequent searches for intergalactic light in clusters of galaxies ( usually in coma ) and hickson s compact groups , using either photographic plates , direct photometric observations or ccd imaging , were not all equally conclusive ( e.g. de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1970 , vilchez , pello & sanahuja 1994 , and references therein ) , with many observers concluding that the amount of intergalactic light could be attributed to low surface brightness galaxies , inaccurate subtraction of foreground stars and halos of galaxies .",
    "another line of attack to track down the debris is to look for intergalactic supernovae . of the thirteen supernovae detected in coma over a period of fifteen effective search years , crane , tammann and woltjer ( 1977 )",
    "could associate all of them with galaxies , either in coma or in the background .",
    "they concluded that the intergalactic debris in coma is at least six times less active per unit light in producing supernovae than the coma galaxies are .",
    "harris ( 1986 ) , following up ideas of merritt ( 1983 , 1984 ) , suggested that the central galaxy in a cluster might be surrounded by a population of globular clusters , stripped from their parent galaxies .",
    "this proposal was investigated by muzzio ( 1987 , and references therein ) and more recently by west et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who suggest that the pronounced globular cluster overabundance of some galaxies in the centres of galaxy clusters is best explained by assuming the existence of a population of intergalactic globular clusters .",
    "in this letter we report on the identification of ten candidate intergalactic planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the fornax galaxy cluster .",
    "fornax ( @xmath4=@xmath5 @xmath6=@xmath7 ( j2000.0 ) , distance @xmath8mpc , mcmillan , ciardullo and jacoby 1993 ) is a poor , dense cluster of galaxies , relatively rich in early type galaxies ( ratio of early to late types a factor of two higher than in virgo , ferguson 1989 ) .",
    "it has a high central density of galaxies ( 500 per mpc@xmath9 ) and a low velocity dispersion ( 350 @xmath10 , ferguson 1989 ) .",
    "its central galaxy , ngc 1399 , is a cd galaxy with both an extended halo of diffuse light ( schombert 1986 , warren , theuns & williger 1996 ) and an abundant and extended globular cluster population ( grillmair et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) .",
    "all these properties suggest that fornax should have a substantial population of intergalactic stars .",
    "since these stars should be similar to the stars in the galaxies , they would also have a sub - population of pne .",
    "the detection of intergalactic pne as far away as fornax is feasible technically , since pne within galaxies in fornax have already been found .",
    "mcmillan et al . ( 1993 ) used narrow - band imaging to identify 72 candidate pne in ngc 1399 .",
    "arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) later obtained spectra for 54 of them and they were able to obtain velocities for a subset of 37 .",

    "criterion 1 requires that the candidates have significant excess flux in the narrow - band frame relative to the flux in the broad - band frame .",
    "criterion 2 states that the line ews are consistent with being large : at the @xmath35 level they are consistent with being infinite .",
    "criterion 3 is an attempt to remove compact emission - line galaxies from the sample . in particular galaxies in these fields at @xmath36 ,",
    "for which the line [ oii ] @xmath37 falls in the narrow - band filter , but which have a substantial @xmath38 break , will be eliminated by this means .",
    "application of the above selection criteria leads to the indentification of 4 , 2 , and 4 candidates in fields 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively . we have checked the images of each candidate in every ccd frame used to make the combined frames , to ensure that the unusual colours are not due to flaws in individual frames , or e.g. cosmic rays , or satellite trails .",

    "the estimated line fluxes , where @xmath40 is the flux per unit wavelength of a continuum source with the same @xmath25 , @xmath41 is the transmission of the filter as a function of wavelength , and @xmath42 is the average transmission over the central few angstroms . ]",

    "to summarise the previous sections , we have discovered 10 objects in our fields whose angular sizes and magnitudes in the three bands are consistent with their being intergalactic pne in the fornax cluster .",
    "we now consider in more detail whether any of the candidates could be distant galaxies , rather than pne , because either [ oii ] 3727 ( @xmath36 ) or ly@xmath4",
    "1216 ( @xmath49 ) falls within the narrow - band filter .",
    "the question is not straightforward to answer as there are few surveys which reach the faint line - flux limits of our narrow - band images , and the continuum fluxes of our candidates , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , are beyond the limits of the faintest magnitude - limited spectroscopic surveys .",
    "nevertheless the lower redshift appears unlikely .",
    "the mean rest - frame ew of the candidates if at @xmath52 is @xmath53 , and such large ews have not been seen for [ oii ] in deep galaxy surveys ( colless et al . 1990 , cowie et al .",
    "furthermore galaxies at this redshift would likely be resolved in our frames .",
    "we can check whether the higher redshift @xmath49 is a possibility by making a direct comparison against the results of the emission - line searches for high - redshift galaxies by lowenthal et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and thompson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . on the basis of their quoted detection limits ,",
    "if our candidates are galaxies at @xmath49 , we estimate that in each of these surveys three galaxies @xmath54 would have been found above the 3@xmath24 detection limits , whereas none was discovered .",
    "this is fairly clear evidence against our candidates being galaxies at @xmath49 .    on the basis of the foregoing we consider it likely that our candidates are intergalactic pne .",
    "we have also compared the distribution in luminosity of our candidates against the luminosity function of ciardullo et al .",
    "a k - s test indicates a satisfactory fit , which increases our confidence in our identification . just before completing this letter we received a preprint by arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who , while searching for pne in the outer halo of the virgo elliptical ngc  4406 , serendipitously found three pne with radial velocities widely different from that of the target galaxy .",
    "they concluded that these pne may be intergalactic stars in the virgo cluster . with the wide - field ccd cameras becoming available",
    "it appears that it may now be possible to detect intergalactic pne in large numbers .",
    "proceeding on the assumption that our 10 emission - line candidates are intergalactic pne , we next try to estimate the contribution of intergalactic stars to the total light in the fornax cluster .",
    "our observations reach about one magnitude below @xmath55 in the pne luminosity function , and we adopt the value for the luminosity - specific planetary nebula density for m31 , @xmath56 ( ciardullo et al .",
    "( we note , however , that the value of @xmath57 is probably different for different stellar populations ( hui et al .",
    "1993 ) , and therefore the chosen value may not be appropriate for intergalactic debris . ) we surveyed 104 arcmin@xmath58 , so this provides an estimate for the surface brightness in tidal debris of @xmath59 per arcmin@xmath58 .",
    "the total luminosity contributed by galaxies contained in the central 200arcmin@xmath60 200arcmin region of fornax is @xmath61 ( caldwell 1987 ) , corresponding to a surface brightness of @xmath62 per arcmin@xmath58 . comparing these two values we estimate that the contribution of intergalactic stars to the total light in the fornax cluster could be as much as @xmath63 .    to summarise , with narrow - band imaging we have searched for intergalactic pne in the fornax cluster , and discovered 10 good candidates , which require spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "future surveys could detect hundreds of such objects .",
