    "high@xmath7 superconductivity often occurs when the system is driven from its pristine phase to the verge of magnetic quantum critical point via external parameters such as chemical doping , magnetic field or pressure ( @xmath8 ) in most of the cuprates , heavy fermions , pnictides , and organic superconductors .",
    "however , several recent breakthrough discoveries of a second superconducting ( sc ) dome @xmath9 completely isolated or slightly connected to the first sc dome @xmath9 without the intervention of any competing order as a function of @xmath8 in several families of high-@xmath10 superconductors,@xcite and/ or extreme chemical doping in kfe@xmath2as@xmath2,@xcite lafeaso@xmath11h@xmath12@xcite or strain@xcite have questioned this expectation .",
    "much higher optimal @xmath10 value than that of the first dome , as well as a substantial increase in electronic mass with @xmath8 as obtained in iron - based compounds suggest an interesting and exotic phenomena of superconductivity along this tuning axis .",
    "it is notable that in stochiometric srfe@xmath2as@xmath2 , a sc dome appears both as a function of @xmath8,@xcite as well as crystallographic strain@xcite near the quantum critical point of spin - density wave , as often observed in other high-@xmath10 superconductors , further supporting the notion that the @xmath8 induced superconductivity is unconventional . in this paper , we present a model that allows us to capture the onset of the second sc phase with different pairing symmetry as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "our approach is based on the weak or intermediate coupling scenario in which the shape of the fermi surface ( fs ) topology plays a key role in creating pairing instability at the ` hot - spot'.@xcite for such case cooper pairing arises from repulsive interaction with sign - reversal pairing symmetry constrained by the fs topology and crystal symmetries .",
    "this theoretical framework consistently describes @xmath13wave pairing in cuprates,@xcite and ce - based heavy fermions,@xcite @xmath6-pairing in iron - pnictides and chalcogenides,@xcite and nodeless @xmath5-wave in @xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 [ @xmath3=k , cs , rb,(tl , rb ) , ( tl , k ) ] families.@xcite    here , we focus on the latter family in which a second isolated dome is observed , as shown fig .",

    "constrained by these experimental facts we postulate that uniform @xmath8 renormalizes the bands in a way that goes beyond standard fermi - liquid ( fl ) behavior , as also shown in first - principles calculations,@xcite and thereby affects the fs topology . in @xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 systems , both first principles calculation and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) have demonstrated that a hole - pocket lies slightly below the fermi level ( @xmath16 ) at ambient @xmath8 . with band renormalization",
    "this hole pocket appears on the fs above a critical @xmath8 , and the overall fs topology changes from only electron - pockets at @xmath17 to the coexisting electron and hole pocket as in pnictides .",
    "this topological fs transition induces a crossover from fs nesting along diagonal @xmath18 direction to along zone direction @xmath19 which makes a pairing symmetry transition from nodeless @xmath5-wave to @xmath6-pairing .",
    "we explore these postulates via first - principles band structure and pairing eigenvalue calculations within random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the first - principles calculation is performed for kfe@xmath2se@xmath2 within the atomic sphere approximation by using the tight - binding - linearized muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) code.@xcite for a given @xmath8 , the uniform volume contraction is evaluated using birch - murnaghan equation of state@xcite formalism ( given below ) . the key here is to optimize the se atomic position with respect to the fe plane by minimizing total energy at each @xmath8 .",
    "we find @xmath20 at @xmath17  gpa and @xmath21 at @xmath22  gpa .",
    "the obtained band structure in fig .  [ fig1](c ) shows that at @xmath2312 gpa , the bands are renormalized by @xmath24 ( see inset ) which allows the hole - pockets to appear on the fs .",
    "the change of fs via band renormalization can be understood this way . as deduced below",
    ", the pressure - induced renormalization affects the hopping energies , not the chemical potential .",
    "thus at each pressure a new fermi energy appears which allows the shifting of the band along the energy direction .",
    "this result is unexpected from the standard fermi liquid picture .",
    "therefore the dominant fs instability arises along @xmath25 at a critical pressure , and thus @xmath6 pairing with large coupling constant commences .",
    "we also semi - quantitatively reproduce the phase diagram of the @xmath5 and @xmath6-pairings within the conditions for best nestings along each channels .",
    "to grasp further insight into how @xmath8 modifies electronic structure , and also to enable adding correlations for pairing symmetry calculations , we use a low - energy five - bands tight - binding ( tb ) formalism from ref .",
    "@xcite at zero pressure , and include pressure effects by band renormalizations .",
    "the tb hopping integrals @xmath26 in a given crystal is defined as @xmath27 , @xmath28 is coulomb interaction between lattice and electron . since the tb hopping involves integration over the unit - cell volume , the simplest approximation to account for the change in tb parameters due to the change in unit cell volume is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the tb parameters and lattice volume at any given @xmath8 @xmath8 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are their corresponding values at ambient @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath35 does not renormalize the spectral weight , and thus at each pressure a new fermi level occurs to keep the number of electron unchanged .",
    "this constraint allows the change in fs upon renormalization of the bands .",
    "we compute the fermi level @xmath16 self - consistently , beyond a simple rigid band shift approximation , by integrating the density of state upto @xmath16 .",
    "this electron number can be related to the fs volume in a slightly revised luttinger theory as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the unitless fs volume at @xmath17 .",
    "this formula can be contrasted with the conventional luttinger theorem which says that the fs volume , after applying a fl - like renormalization , does not change , because @xmath47 , where @xmath48 should be read as bare fs volume .",
    "the important different between the present formalism and fl thus comes from the fact that while in fl @xmath35 renormalizes both spectral weight and dispersion , in the present case it only renormalizes the band not the spectral weight .",
    "this allows the change in fs topology and volume as a function of pressure , while @xmath49 remains constant , constrained by the number of of electron .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] reveals the evolution of electronic states at ambient @xmath8 and at @xmath8=12 gpa . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the hole pockets lies at 60  mev below @xmath16 at @xmath4-point , as is also seen in arpes data.@xcite in this case , the presence of electron pockets at x - points ( in 1 fe per unit cell notation ) is well established.@xcite with the uniform band renormalization by @xmath50 at @xmath22gpa , according to eq .  1 , we find that two concentric hole pockets are fully formed on the fs as seen from figs .",

    "<S> recent observation of pressure induced second superconducting phase in @xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 [ @xmath3=k , ( tl , rb ) ] calls for the models of superconductivity that are rich enough to allow for multiple superconducting phases . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the model where pressure induces renormalization of band parameters in such a way that it leads to changes in fermi surface topology even for a fixed electron number . </S>",
    "<S> we develop low - energy effective model , derived from first - principles band - structure calculation at finite pressure , to suggest the phase assignment where low pressure superconducting state with no hole pocket at @xmath4 point is a nodeless @xmath5-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> it evolves into a @xmath6 state at higher pressure when the fermi surface topology changes and hole pocket appears . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the pairing interactions using five band tight binding fitted band structure and find strong pairing strength dependents on pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the energy and momentum dependence of neutron spin resonances in each of the phases as verifiable predictions of our proposal . </S>"
