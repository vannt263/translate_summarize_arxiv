    "the formation and the properties of random structures have been a major theme in statistical physics for many years . in case",
    "the formation of such structures obeys local rules , these processes can often be expressed in the language of population growth .",
    "it is well known that two particular growth processes lead to random structures with the properties of percolation clusters .",
    "the so called simple epidemic process ( sep ) leads to directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite .",
    "the sep is also known as epidemic with recovery , gribov process  @xcite , as the stochastic version of schlgls first reaction  @xcite or in elementary particle physics as reggeon field theory  @xcite .",
    "the so called general epidemic process ( gep )  @xcite , also known as epidemic with removal , generates isotropic percolation ( ip ) clusters  @xcite and models therefore the universality class of dynamic isotropic percolation ( dip ) .",
    "epidemic models like the sep and the gep are relevant for a wide range of systems in physics , chemistry , biology , and sociology . undoubtedly , the potential of such simple models has its limitations because they rely on strong simplifying assumptions such as the homogeneity of the substrate  @xcite , isotropy of the infections , immobility of individuals and so on .",
    "however , the transition between population survival and extinction of these processes is a nonequilibrium continuous ( second order ) phase transition phenomenon and hence is characterized by _",
    "universal _ scaling laws which are shared by entire classes of systems . near these transitions , simplistic epidemic models like the sep and",
    "the gep are of great value , because they are powerful workhorses to study the mutual properties of their entire universality class which also should include more realistic models .",
    "the universal properties of dp and dip are well known today thanks to numerous studies of the sep and gep , respectively .",
    "relatively little is known , on the other hand , whether and under what modifications these stochastic growth processes allow for first order phase transitions between their endemic and pandemic states , and by the same token , for tricritical behavior at the phase - space boundary between first and second order transition . in the context of dp ,",
    "these questions where addressed to some extend by ohtsuki and keyes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study this intriguing topic in the context of dip by generalizing the famous gep .",
    "the standard gep , assumed for simplicity to take place on a lattice @xcite , can be described with help of the reaction scheme    [ gep]@xmath5 with reaction rates @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 respectively denote susceptible , ill , and dead ( or immune ) individuals on nearest neighbor sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 . a susceptible individual",
    "may be infected by an ill neighbor with probability @xmath6 [ reaction  ( [ reacta ] ) ] . by this mechanism",
    "the disease ( henceforth also called the agent ) spreads diffusively .",
    "ill individuals die with a probability @xmath7 [ reaction  ( [ reactb ] ) ] .",
    "there is no healing of infected individuals and no spontaneous infection . in a finite system the manifold of states without any infected individual is inevitably absorbing . whether a single infected site leads to an everlasting epidemic in an infinite system depends on the ratio @xmath13 .",
    "with @xmath7 fixed there is a certain value @xmath14 that for all @xmath15 an eternal epidemic ( a pandemic ) occurs .",
    "the probability @xmath16 for the occurrence of a pandemic as a function of @xmath6 goes to zero continuously at the critical point @xmath17 .",
    "the behavior of the model near this critical point is in the universality class of dip .    of course",
    ", one can conceive many alterations of the gep .",
    "some modifications will lead to models which still belong to the dip universality class whereas other alterations will produce models belonging to other universality classes . as an example for the latter , one might think of mobile susceptible or immune individuals which , say , diffuse through space .",
    "the resulting models are reaction - diffusion type models which have nothing to do with dip  @xcite .",
    "we are not interested in this kind of alterations .",
    "rather , we are interested in modifications of the gep that preserve the dip universality class and which , for certain parameter values , allow for tricriticality and first order percolation transitions .",
    "to be more specific , we are interested in the most relevant mechanism leading to tricritical and first order dip . in spirit our model",
    "is closely related to the canonical model for tricriticality in eqilibrium systems , viz .  the @xmath18 model with an additional @xmath19 term where the free energy density is of the form @xmath20",
    "if @xmath21 is positive then higher order terms including the @xmath19 term are irrelevant and one has in mean field theory a second order transition when @xmath22 passes through zero .",
    "otherwise , however , one has an instability and higher order terms are required for stabilization of which the @xmath19 term is the most relevant one . for @xmath23 one",
    "has a first order transition at a critical value of @xmath22 that depends on @xmath21 and @xmath24 and the point @xmath25 constitutes a tricritical point .",
    "our model to be defined in the next paragraph is so that it introduces a similar instability in the gep and via this instability it allows for tricriticality and first order percolation . in its field",
    "theoretic description our model features , compared to the standard gep , an additional higher order term which becomes the most relevant stabilizing term when the usual gep coupling vanishes .",
    "our modification of the gep can be defined in simple terms .",
    "the basic idea is to enrich the reaction scheme  ( [ gep ] ) by introducing _ weak _",
    "individuals @xmath26 . instead of being infected right away by an ill neighbor , any susceptible individual may be weakened with a reaction rate @xmath27 by such an encounter .",
    "when the disease passes by anew , a weakened individual is more sensitive and gets sick with a rate @xmath28 . in the following we refer to this model as the generalized gep ( ggep ) .",
    "in addition to the reactions  ( [ gep ] ) , the ggep is described by the reactions    [ ggep]@xmath29 as we go along , we will show that the occurrence of the weak individuals gives rise to an instability that can lead to a discontinuous transition and compact ( eden @xcite ) growth of the epidemic if @xmath30 is greater than a critical value @xmath31 .",
    "in the enlarged three - dimensional phase space spanned by @xmath6 , @xmath27 , and @xmath30 with fixed @xmath7 , there exists a critical surface associated with the usual continuous percolation transition and a surface of first order transitions characterized by a finite jump in the probability @xmath32 for the occurrence of a pandemic .",
    "these two surfaces of phase transitions meet at a line of tricritical points .",
    "the focus of this paper lies on the universal properties of the ggep near this tricritical line . by using the methods of renormalized field theory we work out a scaling description of the new universality class of tricritical dynamic isotropic percolation ( tdip ) to which the tricritical ggep belongs .",
    "we study a multitude of static and dynamic observables that play important roles in percolation theory .",
    "in particular we calculate the critical exponents describing the scaling behavior of these observables below 5 dimensions as well as logarithmic corrections to the mean - field scaling behavior in 5 dimensions .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ meanfieldsec ] we consider the ggep in a mean - field theory . as the main result of sec .",
    "[ meanfieldsec ] , the mean - field analysis will reveal the structure of the phase diagram .",
    "with the aim of studying the effects of fluctuations , we condense the principles defining tdip into a field theoretic model in sec .  [",
    "sec : fieldtheory ] . in sec .",
    "[ staticggep ] we work out the scaling properties of static aspects of tdip .",
    "section  [ dynggep ] treats the dynamic scaling properties .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "there is one appendix in which we sketch the calculation of a parameter integral that is helpful in computing feynman diagrams .",
    "a mean - field description of the ggep can be formulated by treating the reaction equations ( [ gep ] ) and ( [ ggep ] ) as deterministic equations without fluctuations .",
    "this deterministic approximation leads to the system of differential equations    [ meanfield]@xmath33 governing the dynamics of the different kinds of individuals .",
    "here , @xmath34 denotes summation over the nearest neighbors of @xmath11 . at each lattice site",
    "there is the additional constraint    @xmath35    thus , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and @xmath10 can be interpreted as the probability of finding the corresponding state at a site @xmath11 .",
    "note that the processes can only proceed at places where the probability to find ill individuals in the neighborhood is not zero .",
    "we use the canonical initial condition that all sites of the initial state are susceptible except for the site at the origin which is ill , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "equations  ( [ means ] ) and ( [ meany ] ) are are readily integrated .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 where we have defined @xmath40 .",
    "the time scale @xmath7 has been set to unity for simplicity .",
    "equation  ( [ meane ] ) together with the constraint  ( [ constraint ] ) leads finally to the mean - field equation of motion of the ggep , @xmath41 in the asymptotic regime @xmath42 one can neglect time and space dependence in ( [ ggepstate ] ) and use the approximation @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "hence the asymptotic values of @xmath10 are the solutions of the equation of state @xmath45 by setting @xmath46 , corresponding to @xmath47 , one obtains the equation of state of the usual gep @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 determining the second order phase transition corresponding to ordinary isotropic percolation . for @xmath50 , eq .

    "@xmath52 arises , signalling the percolative pandemic character of the disease .",
    "these types of solutions exist also in the full equation of state  ( [ asymptsol ] ) . using @xmath53 ,",
    "one demonstrates easily that @xmath54 increases monotonically from zero to one in the interval @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath51 is always a solution of eq .",
    "( [ asymptsol ] ) .",
    "it follows from the equation of motion  ( [ ggepstate ] ) that only solutions of eq .",

    "the line of tricritical points where the first and the second order transitions meet in the @xmath6-@xmath64-@xmath30 phase space is determined by @xmath65 .    in the following we focus on the phenomena arising near the tricritical line . in this region of the phase space , @xmath66 is , except for a microscopic region around the origin @xmath67 of the position space , small and slowly varying .",

    "in this section we will derive a dynamic response functional @xcite for the ggep based on very general arguments alluding to the universal properties of tdip .",
    "first we will distill the basic principles of percolation processes allowing for tricritical behavior .",
    "next , we cast these principles into the form of a langevin equation .",
    "then we refine the langevin equation into a minimal field theoretic model .    as an alternative avenue to a field theoretic model for the ggep one migtht",
    "be tempted to use the so - called `` exact '' approach which , as a first step , consists of reformulating the microscopic master - equation for the reactions  ( [ gep ] ) and ( [ ggep ] ) as a bosonic field theory on the lattice . the next and pivotal step in this approach is to take the continuum limit .",
    "albeit the `` exact '' approach with a naive continuum limit leads to a consistent dynamic functional for the ggep ( after deleting several irrelevant terms ) this approach must be cautioned against .",
    "strictly speaking , one has to use wilson s statistical continuum limit @xcite in the renormalization theory of critical phenomena .",
    "this procedure consists of successive coarse graining of the mesoscopic slow variables ( order parameters and conserved quantities as functions of microscopic degrees of freedom ) , the elimination of fluctuating residual microscopic degrees of freedom , and a rescaling of space and time . in general , microscopic variables do _ not _ qualify as order parameters .",
    "alarming examples are the pair contact processes ( pcp and pcpd ) , where a naive continuum limit of the microscopic master - equations leads to untenable critical models .",
    "therefore , we devise our field theoretic model representing the tdip universality class using a purely mesoscopic stochastic formulation based on the correct order parameters identified through physical insight in the nature of the critical phenomenon",
    ". hence , our dynamic response functional stays in full analogy to the landau - ginzburg - wilson functional and provides a reliable starting point of the field theoretic method .      the essence of isotropic percolation processes can be summarized by four statements describing the universal features of the evolution of such processes on a homogeneous substrate . denoting the density of the agents ( the infected individuals ) by @xmath99 and the density of the debris ( the immune or dead individuals ) which is proportional to the density of the weakened substrate by @xmath100 , these four statements",
    "read :    1 .",
    "there is a manifold of absorbing states with @xmath101 and corresponding distributions of @xmath102 depending on the history of @xmath103 .",
    "these states are equivalent to the extinction of the epidemic .",
    "the substrate becomes activated ( infected ) depending on the density of the agents _ and _ the density of the debris .",
    "this mechanism introduces memory into the process .",
    "the debris ultimately stops the disease locally .",
    "however , it is possible that the activation is strengthened by the debris through some mechanism ( sensibilization of the substrate ) .",
    "the process ( the disease ) spreads out diffusively .",
    "the agents ( the activated substrate ) become deactivated ( converted into debris ) after a short time .",
    "there are no other slow variables .",
    "microscopic degrees of freedom can be summarized into a local noise or langevin force @xmath104 respecting the first statement ( i.e. , the noise can not generate agents ) .",
    "the general form of a langevin equation resembling these statements is given by    [ eq : general langevin]@xmath105 where @xmath7 is a kinetic coefficient and the gaussian noise correlation reads    @xmath106    the first row in eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalnoise ] ) represents time - local reaction noise .",
    "the second row describes noise originating from diffusion and the last row shows an example of possible time - non - local noise ( quenched noise ) that may be acquired through random disorder or through the elimination of microscopic slow variables , e.g. , fluctuations of the debris .",
    "the structure of the 3 terms is so that they respect the absorbing state condition .",
    "of course many further contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalnoise ] ) are conceivable ( hence the ellipsis in the third row ) including non - markovian and also non - gaussian noise .",
    "we will see below , that all these terms turn out being irrelevant , and that only the simplest form of reaction noise contributes the minimal field theoretic model .",
    "the dependence of the rate @xmath107 on the density of the debris @xmath100 describes memory of the process mentioned above .",

    "@xmath109 , and @xmath110 . the justification for the truncation of the expansions will be given later by ir relevance - irrelevance arguments .",
    "as long as @xmath82 , the second order term @xmath111 of the rate @xmath112 is irrelevant near the transition point and the process models ordinary dynamic isotropic percolation  @xcite .",
    "we permit both signs of @xmath76 so that our model accounts for sensibilization ( weakened substrate ) and allows for compact ( eden ) spreading",
    ". consequently we need the second order term for stabilization purposes , i.e. , to limit the density @xmath103 to finite values .      in order to apply the renormalization group ( rg ) and field - theoretic methods",
