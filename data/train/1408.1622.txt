    ", quite significant amount of works are dedicated to this issue .",
    "particularly , light interference is an widely investigated topic and , no doubts , its importance for various applications is enormous @xcite . due to quantum interference effects for instance elimination of spectral lines or complete cancellation of the spontaneous decay",
    "can occur .",
    "spatial interference shows interesting features as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , suppression of the resonance fluorescence in a lossless cavity was demonstrated in @xcite whereas cavity - field - assisted atomic relaxation and suppression of resonance fluorescence at high intensities was shown in @xcite .",
    "inhibition of fluorescence in a squeezed vacuum was demonstrated in @xcite while suppression of bragg scattering by collective interference of spatially ordered atoms within a high - q cavity mode was demonstrated , respectively , in @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "cavity - enhanced single - atom spontaneous emission was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite while suppression of spontaneous decay at optical frequencies was shown in @xcite .",
    "the control of the spontaneous decay as well as of the resonance fluorescence is of particular interest for quantum computation processes @xcite where , in addition , highly correlated photons are required @xcite . combining few coherent driving sources one can achieve a further degree of control of the atom s quantum dynamics . actually , the bichromatic driving of single atoms was intensively investigated recently emphasizing interesting interference phenomena . in particular ,",
    "the resonance fluorescence of a two - level atom in a strong bichromatic field was analyzed in @xcite and the response of a two - level system to two strong fields was experimentally studied in @xcite , correspondingly .",
    "the decay of bichromatically driven atom in a cavity was investigated in @xcite .",
    "broadband high - resolution x - ray frequency combs were obtained via bichromatically pumping of three - level @xmath0type atoms @xcite . moreover ,",

    "the above mentioned works may be of particular relevance in a quantum network @xcite , for instance .",
    "related systems have been already proven to act as an optical diode @xcite - an important ingredient in a quantum network . since a precise control over system s properties",
    "is highly required in such a network , here , we investigate the feasibility of controlling the cavity output electromagnetic field in a system consisting of a moderately strongly pumped two - level emitter .",
    "if a second coherent driving is applied through one of the mirrors and perpendicular to the first laser - beam then the output cavity field can be almost completely inhibited in the good - cavity limit .",
    "notice that the lasers are in resonance with the cavity mode frequency .",
    "we have found that the interference between the second weaker light beam and the light scattered by the two - level emitter into the cavity mode due to stronger pumping is responsible for the suppression effect .",
    "the destructive interference can be turned into constructive one ( or viceversa ) via varying the phase difference of the applied lasers .",
    "furthermore , the inhibition requires the laser frequency to be out of atomic frequency resonance while for photonic crystals surroundings it can be even on resonance .",

    "the hamiltonian describing a two - level atomic system having the transition frequency @xmath1 and interacting with a strong coherent source of frequency @xmath2 while embedded in a pumped micro - cavity of frequency @xmath3 , in a frame rotating at @xmath4 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . in the hamiltonian ( [ hm ] ) the components , in order of appearance , describe the atomic and the cavity free energies , the interaction of the two - level emitter with the micro - cavity mode and the atom s interaction with the first laser field with @xmath8 being the corresponding rabi frequency , and respectively , the interaction of the second driving field with the cavity mode with @xmath9 being proportional to the input laser field strength amplitude . the atomic bare - state operators @xmath10 and @xmath11^{\\dagger}$ ] obey the commutation relations for su(2 ) algebra , i.e. , @xmath12=2s_{z}$ ] and @xmath13=\\pm s^{\\pm}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the bare - state inversion operator .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the excited and ground state of the atom while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the creation and the annihilation operator of the electromagnetic field ( emf ) in the resonator , and satisfy the standard bosonic commutation relations , namely , @xmath19=1 $ ] , and @xmath20=[a^{\\dagger},a^{\\dagger}]=0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 are the corresponding phases of the coherent driving sources .",
    "we shall describe our system using the laser - qubit semiclassical dressed - state formalism defined as @xcite : @xmath22 . applying this transformation to ( [ hm ] )",
    "one arrives then at the following dressed - state hamiltonian @xmath23 with @xmath24 here , @xmath25 while @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we employed also @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31^{\\dagger}$ ] in the hamiltonian ( [ hm ] ) and dropped the tilde afterwards .",
    "the new quasi - spin operators , i.e. , @xmath32 , @xmath33^{\\dagger}$ ] and @xmath34 are operating in the dressed - state picture .",

    "considering that @xmath37 the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) can be ignored under the secular approximation .",
    "therefore , the master equation describing the laser - dressed two - level atom inside a leaking pumped resonator and damped via the vacuum modes of the surrounding emf reservoir is : @xmath38 = - \\kappa [ a^{\\dagger},a\\rho ] -\\gamma_{0}[r_{z},r_{z}\\rho ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & - &   \\gamma_{+}[r^{+},r^{-}\\rho ] - \\gamma_{-}[r^{-},r^{+}\\rho ]   + h.c .. \\label{me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 respectively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the single - atom spontaneous decay rates being dependent on the density of modes , @xmath42 , at the dressed - state frequencies @xmath43 , while @xmath44 signifies the pure dephasing rate . in free space one",
    "has that @xmath45 .",
    "note that the master equation ( [ me ] ) was obtained either under the intense - field condition or far off detuned field , i.e. , it is valid when @xmath46 .",
    "the equations of motion for the variables of interest can be easily obtained from the master equation ( [ me ] ) .",
    "therefore , the quantum dynamics is described by the following system of linear differential equations : @xmath47 in the system of equations ( [ sseq1 ] ) , we have used the trivial condition @xmath48 which is the case for a single - qubit system .    in the following section",
    ", we shall discuss our results , i.e. , the possibility of inhibiting the cavity output field in the steady - state via interference effects .",
    "one of the solutions of system ( [ sseq1 ] ) in the steady - state represents the mean - photon number in the micro - cavity mode , namely : @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath45 , the coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by the following expressions : @xmath54 because of the quadratic dependence on @xmath9 , the minimum value of the mean - photon number is : @xmath55 the above value is achieved at : @xmath56 based on eqs .",
    "( [ kf ] ) and ( [ min ] ) it follows that @xmath57 is independent on @xmath58 and its value does not exceed @xmath59 .",
    "the cavity output field , i.e. , the number of photons escaping the cavity per second , can be evaluated via @xmath60 .",
    "particularly , in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) the minimum value of the steady - state mean - photon number is @xmath61 and is achieved when @xmath62 .",
    "an explanation of the steady - state behaviors shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) can be found if one represents the mean - photon number given by ( [ apm ] ) as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath64 from the above expression ( [ cint ] ) , one can see that for @xmath50 the mean - photon number due to weaker external pumping of the cavity mode is proportional to @xmath65 while that due to stronger driving of the two - level qubit to @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "there is also a cross - contribution proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "all these terms demonstrate interference effects among the contributions due to two pumping lasers and , hence , the minima s nature in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath68 one has from eq .",
    "( [ cint ] ) that @xmath69 while for @xmath70 we have , respectively ,    @xmath71    thus , indeed , the output field suppression ( or enhancement ) occurs because of the interference effect taking place among the fraction of light @xmath72 scattered by the atom into the cavity mode due to stronger pumping by the first laser beam and , respectively , the photon field of the second weaker laser field characterized by @xmath73 ( see , also , figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the nature of destructive or constructive interference can be understood as follows : in the dressed - state picture both lasers are simultaneously in resonance with the dressed - state transitions @xmath74 and @xmath75 and , hence , different signs in front of the last term in eqs .",
    "( [ cint1],[cint2 ] ) . actually , if @xmath68 the atom is located on the lower dressed - state @xmath76 while it resides on the higher dressed - state @xmath77 when @xmath70 .",
    "however , the destructive interference can be turned into constructive one ( or viceversa ) via varying the phase difference @xmath78 ( see eq .",
    "[ cint1 ] and eq .",
    "[ cint2 ] ) .",
    "this allows a better control of the output cavity field",
    ". notice that on resonance , i.e. , @xmath79 , the inhibition effects are absent when @xmath80 because @xmath81 resulting in @xmath82 ( see eq .  [ cint ] ) .",
    "also , one can obtain small values for @xmath83 if @xmath84 .",
    "however , in this case we are in the bad - cavity limit and , therefore , lower values for mean - photon number or even zero are expected @xcite .",
    "thus , in contrary , the cavity output field suppression reported here occurs in the good - cavity limit , i.e. , when @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "apart from the dependence of the expression ( [ cint ] ) on the parameters @xmath87 it depends also on the generalized dressed - state decay rates @xmath88 .",
    "these decay rates can be modified either by varying the detuning @xmath89 in free - space with @xmath80 or via modification of the density of modes at the dressed - state frequencies @xmath90 and , consequently , @xmath91 which is a typical situation in photonic crystal environments @xcite , for instance .",
    "in particular , one can have also the situation when @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "figure ( [ fig3 ] ) shows the mean - photon numbers obtained with the help of the expression ( [ cint ] ) when the two - level emitter is located inside a microscopic cavity engineered in a photonic crystal material . in this case",
    ", the output cavity field can be suppressed even on atom - laser frequency resonance , i.e. when @xmath79 ( see the dotted curve ) , because @xmath91 and the population will be distributed unequally among the dressed states while @xmath94 negative values for the dressed - state inversion with @xmath95 lead to cavity output field suppression ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] and eq .",
    "[ cint1 ] ) . for the sake of comparison",
    ", the solid curve stands for ordinary vacuum - cavity environments .",
    "thus , finalizing , we have shown here how the output cavity field can be minimized due to interference effects .",
    "summarizing , we have demonstrated the feasibility of cavity output field control via interference effects .",
    "the system of interest is formed from a strongly pumped two - level atom placed in an optical micro - resonator . a second weak laser being in resonance with the cavity mode frequency is probing the whole system through one of the cavity s mirror .",
    "consequently , interference effects occur among the light scattered in the cavity mode by the strongly pumped atom and the incident weaker laser field leading to output cavity field inhibition or enhancement .",
    "furthermore , the destructive interference can be turned into constructive one ( or viceversa ) via varying the phase difference of the applied lasers providing in this way a better control over output electromagnetic field.the idea works for photonic crystal environments as well .",
