    "there is growing evidence that the properties of the gas in the nuclei of starburst galaxies may be very different from those seen in galactic star - forming regions and that a high kinetic temperature in the molecular gas may lead to a non - standard initial mass function in the next generation of stars @xcite .",
    "observations of gas - phase atoms and molecules in starburst galaxies allow us , in principle , to study the physical characteristics of environments that are quite different from those found in our own galaxy , e.g. lower or higher abundances of heavy elements , stronger radiation fields and different cosmic - ray ionisation rates .",
    "starbursts can occur in disk galaxies , and irregular galaxies often exhibit knots of starburst activity , which can be spread throughout their ism . infrared photometry and , later , infrared spectroscopy have provided powerful diagnostics to distinguish between the main emission mechanisms in starburst galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are characterised by uncommonly high star formation efficiencies ( sfe=@xmath9/sfr ) , but it remains unclear what physical conditions in the molecular gas produce such high efficiency .",
    "invariably , high star formation efficiency is associated with high column densities of molecular material ( e.g. the kennicutt - schmidt law ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "much of the interest in starburst galaxies arises from the fact that some galaxies , and often very small regions within their nuclei , manage to effectively convert a large amount of gas into stars in a very short time .",
    "often there is plenty of molecular gas present ( inferred via its co emission ) , so it is not a fuelling question so much as a collection puzzle .",
    "it is important to take advantage of the bright emission lines in these types of galaxies in order to investigate the mechanisms that are taking place in the regions they trace .",
    "emission lines of different coolants , such as , , and co rotational transitions , are widely used to determine the gas properties . in particular , is the dominant cooling line in the warm neutral ism @xcite .",
    "it emits predominantly from the surface layers of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , where the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation from the hii region is impinging .",
    "oxygen has a slightly higher ionisation potential than hydrogen and therefore is principally in atomic form within neutral regions .",
    "in particular , is emitted primarily from warm and dense gas and is the main coolant in pdrs after . since and both [ oi ]",
    "lines are emitted from the surfaces of pdrs , their ratios provide a good diagnostic for the strength of the fuv field .",
    "however , the line suffers from self - absorption , the amount of which is uncertain and depends on the properties of the pdr ( i.e. its density structure , the strength of fuv radiation , cosmic - ray ionisation rate , etc .",
    "the antennae galaxies , ngc 4038/9 ( arp 244 ) , are one of the best - known examples of interacting starburst galaxies .",
    "the two nuclei and the dust obscured overlap region in between exhibit one of the most stunning examples of starburst activity in the nearby universe @xcite . with a luminosity just below 10@xmath10 @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the antennae do not qualify as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , however they maintain a high star formation rate .",
    "the distance to the antennae has been a subject of recent controversy : although the most commonly assumed value is 19.2 mpc @xcite , more recent observations by @xcite have increased the distance estimate to @xmath13 mpc .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the antennae galaxies using observations of several low-@xmath6 co emission lines .",
    "they found that the two nuclei , ngc 4038/9 , are both regions of high star formation rate .",
    "ngc 4038 is likely to be a streamer caused by the galaxy interaction and it seems to be less disturbed by the collision than ngc 4039 . of particular interest is the ` interaction region ' ( iar ) or ` overlap region ' which connects ngc 4038/9 and which appears to be optically thick , containing high density regions .",
    "probably most of the star formation activity takes place here , as revealed by _",
    "herschel_-pacs observations @xcite , and at an even higher rate than in the nuclei of ngc 4038/9 .",
    "the bulk of the current star formation in the interacting system , which extends over tens of kpc , is confined to just two compact regions @xcite .",
    "usually in a starburst situation , a predominant fraction of the pah emission arises from the diffuse ism , heated only by the interstellar radiation field , with only a small fraction arising from pdrs @xcite .",
    "however , in colliding starburst galaxies such as the antennae , the situation is reversed , with most of the pah emission coming from the regions of recent star formation , as in the map shown by @xcite , where pah emission primarily traces the pdrs and hence the environment of ob clusters .",
    "the nuclei of both ngc 4038 and ngc 4039 are thus very active star - forming regions , surrounded by regions of moderately active star formation . finally , while the nucleus of ngc 4039 appears brighter in the [ neiii ] and [ siv ] emission lines , the lack of [ nev ] emission and the low [ oiv]/[neii ] ratio rules out the presence of an agn for both nuclei @xcite .    maps of the antennae galaxies in the cooling line , at an angular resolution of 55 , showed that the starburst activity is confined to small regions of high sfe @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an excellent correlation between the strengths of the co emission and the 15@xmath14 m broad band emission seen by _ iso _ , and determined masses of 36@xmath1510@xmath16  @xmath17 for the largest molecular complexes , typically an order of magnitude larger than the largest structures found in the disks of more quiescent spiral galaxies .",
    "recently , schirm et al .",
    "( 2013 , _ in press _ ; hereafter ` s13 ' ) presented _ herschel _ spire - fts observations of five co transition lines ( @xmath183 to @xmath197 ) , both [ ci ] transitions and the [ nii ] 205@xmath14 m transition . using radiative transfer analysis they found that a one - component model can not represent a physical solution , since it only recovers warm kinetic temperature ( @xmath20 ) and low density ( @xmath21 ) molecular gas .",
    "instead , they find evidence for a two - component model with an additional cold ( @xmath2230 k ) molecular gas component . using pdr models performed by @xcite , they found that in both ngc 4038/9 nuclei , as well as in the overlap region , their emission line observations were best fit by models with an average interstellar radiation field strength of about @xmath23@xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the standard @xcite field .",
    "the work by @xcite using high resolution n - body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations produced remarkably similar morphological density structures to those observed . using dust radiative transfer calculations , they also found a good agreement with the observed @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared observations of the @xmath29co(10 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 32 ) and lines with pdr models .",
    "they found good agreement when the modelled clouds had moderately high densities , up to @xmath30  @xmath31 , and rather low kinetic temperature ( @xmath32  k ) .",
    "this allowed them to estimate the total molecular gas mass of the antennae to be @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "however , several authors have considered the presence of various heating mechanisms other than uv radiation .",
    "@xcite argued that in the nucleus of ngc 4039 the observed h@xmath35 10 s(1 ) line is primarily emitted by c - shocks and not by the uv - exposed gas in pdrs .",
    "@xcite presented two scenarios based on co observations to explain the strong mid - ir continuum emission seen in some ` super - giant molecular complexes ' , namely : i ) the presence of young star - forming sites in which the embedded o stars have not yet managed to blow away the surrounding dust ; and ii ) the presence of shocked boundary layers of colliding clouds .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that apart from shock - driven heating , cosmic rays and ambipolar diffusion could potentially increase the emission of the observed lines , while s13 argue that the mechanical heating by supernovae and turbulence is probably sufficient to match the total cooling and heat up the molecular gas in the antennae .",
    "recently , @xcite using alma co(32 ) interferometry and vlt / sinfoni imaging spectroscopy of h@xmath35 10 s(1 ) found that the emission of molecular hydrogen is powered by shocks and that those two lines can be used respectively as tracers for energy dissipation and gas mass .",
    "in this paper we present results from a suite of pdr models computed using the 3d - pdr code @xcite and we compare our models with ground - based , _",
    "iso_-lws and the recent _ herschel _ spire - fts observations of the ngc 4038 nucleus .",
    "we investigate the correlation between the local density and the uv field strength in different co transition lines and fine structure lines .",
    "while previous studies have suggested that pdrs can not be the only source of emission lines and that additional heating mechanisms are needed , we explore whether this claim still holds if one relaxes the assumption of a single - component model . in section [ sec : numeric ] we discuss the numerical treatment we follow for the pdr models . in section [ sec : observ ] we describe the observations of ngc 4038 taken from the literature and our methodology for convolving them to a common beam size . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results from our grid of pdr models and in section [ sec : disc ] we provide further discussion on our outcomes .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we use 3d - pdr @xcite , a three - dimensional time - dependent astrochemistry code designed for treating pdrs of arbitrary density distribution .",
    "3d - pdr has been fully benchmarked with other pdr codes following the tests presented in @xcite and has been previously used to study the chemistry in turbulent star - forming clouds @xcite . for full technical details about the code , see @xcite .",
    "we consider one - dimensional uniform density clouds following the same methodology as described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we place 20 elements ( depth points ) in @xmath36 dex intervals , starting at @xmath37 .",
    "the total visual extinction in all clouds is fixed at @xmath38 .",
    "thus , each cloud consists of @xmath39 elements distributed logarithmically with increasing cloud depth .",
    "the elements of the cloud are aligned with two opposing healpix rays @xcite while we assume very high optical depths for all other ray directions , implying that each cloud is a semi - infinite one - dimensional slab . in this setup ,",
    "convergence of the various model properties is treated as described in @xcite . in all cloud models discussed below",
    ", we note that the temperatures , abundances and line emissions are calculated up to the maximum @xmath0 , however we examine the resulting integrated intensities ( surface brightnesses ) up to smaller values in visual extinction .    the chemical network we use in this paper",
    "is a subset of the most recent umist data base of reaction rates ( umist 2012 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this `` reduced '' chemical network consists of 33 species ( including electrons ) and 320 reactions and is used to model the gas - phase chemistry .",
    "it includes the four most abundant elements h , he , o , and c , as well as mg .",
    "we include mg to represent the metal contribution in the ionization fraction .",
    "it neglects polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , although they have been considered for the photoelectring heating .",
    "we use the umist 2012 rates with the exception of the reaction rates for the photodissociation of h@xmath35 and co and the photoionisation of carbon . for these particular cases",
    "we adopt the treatment of @xcite and @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "following a recent update of the 3d - pdr code , we calculate the rate of molecular hydrogen formation on grains using the detailed treatment of @xcite . the dust temperature for each cloud element is determined using the methodology of @xcite based on heating due to fuv photons incident on the cloud surface .",
    "we have assumed that dust is made of a mix of silicate and carbonaceous grains . the grain radius , @xmath40 , is taken to be @xmath41 , the grain number density , @xmath42 , is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gas density , and the gas - to - dust mass ratio , @xmath45 , is @xmath46 .",
    "the turbulent velocity resulting from energy dissipation through shocks , which governs the turbulent heating and escape of cooling line emission within the cloud , is set to @xmath47  kms@xmath48 , typical of individual molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further details of the model parameters can be found in @xcite . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the cosmic - ray ionization rate per h@xmath35 molecule , @xmath49 , plays a crucial role in determining the chemistry and the thermal balance in pdrs .",
    "it is a dominant factor controlling the cosmic - ray - driven chemistry and heating and has a significant effect in the innermost part of the cloud . in this paper",
    "however , we do not explore @xmath49 as a free parameter .",
    "instead we assume it to be constant with a value of @xmath50 .",
    "a higher value of this rate would increase the temperature of the inner part of pdrs .",
    "3d - pdr performs an iterative scheme to determine the gas temperature by balancing the heating and cooling rates in each cloud element .",
    "we evolve the chemistry in each simulation for 10 myr , by which time it has reached equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this timescale is smaller than the 100myr commonly used , however due to the initial conditions adopted here we reach equilibrium in a much shorter timescale .",
    "@xcite used starburst99 @xcite models to fit the cluster colour - colour diagrams for ngc 4038/9 and found that the system is best reproduced assuming solar chemical composition .",
    "conversely , they found that models with subsolar chemical composition can clearly be excluded .",
    "direct abundance estimates based on nebular electron temperature diagnostics have not been published for the antennae galaxies .",
    "x - ray spectra have indicated abundances in many regions that are consistent with solar @xcite",
    "so we adopt the solar abundances of @xcite , a summary of which is shown in table [ tab : abund ] .",
    "we note that these abundances do not correspond to the standard milky way gas - phase abundances but rather to undepleted solar abundances .",

    "* ) . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flines ] , we use the / line ratio as a diagnostic for the uv field .",
    "although , as we have mentioned above , the local emissivity of the line peaks at intermediate depths , the best - fit models for this ratio indicate the presence of a strong radiation field , which is required to heat the gas in order to excite the line",
    ". we find here that the uv field is in general @xmath51 .",
    "we note that , of the fine structure lines , only was observed using a different telescope ( cso ) and thus is subject to a different amount of beam dilution .",
    "if the emission is more diluted than we have assumed when convolving to the 80  beam , then the best - fit region in the middle panel of fig.[fig : flines ] would move upward , implying stronger best - fit uv field strengths .",
    "for the line intensity , which is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flines ] , the model line emission shows little sensitivity to density and is instead constrained by the uv field .",
    "we find that the observed line intensity is in general reproduced by models with a uv field strength of @xmath52@xmath53 .",
    "if the emission is diluted by the beam , then this would suggest that a stronger uv field would be required .",
    "this in turn would lead to better agreement with the uv field implied by the / ratio .",
    "we find that in order to reproduce the uv field strength implied by the / ratio , the required beam dilution factor would be @xmath54 .    .",

    "this line suffers from beam dilution and we find that it is highly underestimaed by a factor of @xmath54.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    we note that the emission is matched by a very low radiation field , lower than @xmath55 , which contradicts the outcomes we find from all the other lines .",
    "we explain this by the following scenario : if the pdr surfaces cover the region and fill the beam , then the lower value can not be a result of beam dilution .",
    "therefore , either the pdrs are not uniformly distributed across the region , or their outermost layers are very thin , significantly less than @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we reproduce the observed intensity with a pdr layer of only @xmath59 . for model clouds of the same density interacting with @xmath60",
    ", we match the observed intensity for @xmath61 , while for @xmath62 and @xmath60 , only @xmath63 of pdr material is needed to reproduce the line intensity . in all cases @xmath64 .    in addition , as discussed above , the line suffers from self - absorption , the amount of which is not constant .",
    "@xcite used the smmol radiative transfer code @xcite to model the [ oi ] emission from pdrs and found that the line intensity may be reduced by 2080% , depending on the pdr parameters .",
    "we have adopted the assumption that the clouds have distinct velocities along the line of sight . under this assumption",
    "the intensity is not prone to mutual shielding and self - absorption and therefore the clouds do not attenuate .    in this paper",
    "we choose not to present ratios involving fine structure lines with co lines , as these lines have been observed by different instruments and thus the beam dilution factor is not known .",
    "this is of crucial importance as the fine structure line is emitted from the outermost and thinnest parts of pdrs , contrary to the co lines which are emitted from a wider region in the innermost parts of pdrs , as discussed in the introduction to this section .      from our analysis",
    "so far we see that different transitions are tracing gas components characterised by different excitations and densities .",
    "we thus argue that within the low spatial resolution beams available to extragalactic studies , it is reasonable to exclude discussions about _ average _ conditions , i.e. densities or radiation fields . nevertheless",
    ", it can be instructive to plot all our results together and draw a summary of our findings . from fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] , where we plot the best fits for all the observed co line intensities in a density - uv plane , we find the following quantitative results :    a.   the co(10 ) transition can be fitted by the largest range of @xmath44uv combinations , where a low density requires a low radiation field strength and vice - versa . taken in isolation",
    "this transition does not provide us with any information on the density or radiation field of the gas .",
    "b.   as we move towards higher transitions , the parameter space is more constrained in density , i.e the co(65 ) and co(76 ) lines are best fitted by densities between @xmath65 . c.   although the best fit for each transition is given by a different model , there is a @xmath44uv space convergence in the ranges of @xmath66@xmath67 in density and @xmath68@xmath69 in radiation strength .",
    "we see that all co lines converge towards higher best - fit densities and uv field strengths than those implied by the fine structure lines .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that some fraction of the co line emission arises from gas heated by other mechanisms , such as turbulent heating , supernova - driven shocks or shocks produced by colliding giant molecular clouds .",
    "however , we do not perform any further analysis here to study these different mechanisms .    in summary , while it may make sense to derive an average radiation field for the region ( and hence obtain an idea of energetics ) , it is less meaningful to infer a single best fit value for the density of the gas .",
    "our findings from the unified picture are generally in agreement with those of other authors who have attempted to model the antennae galaxies , pointing to a stronger - than - galactic uv field together with a gas component at high enough density to reproduce the observed intensities .",
    "early work by @xcite using _",
    "iso_-lws observations found that the typical cloud properties of pdrs corresponded to densities of @xmath70 interacting with uv fields of @xmath71 times the local interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , and that their temperatures were about @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite used observations and assumed a single emission component in the beam to infer that the average density in ngc 4038 is @xmath73 with a uv radiation field of @xmath74 .",
    "they also found that the bulk of the emission comes from pdrs and that only a minor fraction of the line emission can come from ionised gas in hii regions .",
    "@xcite also found that the observed emission lines of ngc 4038/9 can be explained using a best fit model with density @xmath75 and uv field of @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast , @xcite derived a best fit density @xmath77 and a uv field strength @xmath78 .",
    "these latter values , especially those of @xcite , are significantly higher than those we infer .",
    "@xcite analysed co @xmath790 to @xmath802 line observations and argued that the average isrf is between 500 and @xmath81 , and that most of the co emission arises from small and moderately dense clumps with @xmath82 .",
    "these authors used low-@xmath6 transition lines for their analysis which corresponds to the first crossing shown in fig.[fig : all ] . however including higher @xmath6 transition lines shifts the best - fit area to higher densities interacting with stronger uv radiation fields .",
    "hence such additional information may give rise to a different interpretation of the data .",
    "in the work by s13 , the pdr models they used suggested the presence of a warm gas component with an average isrf of @xmath83 and a cold component exposed to @xmath84 .",
    "they also claim that these values are consistent with all three regions of the antennae ( the ngc 4038/9 nuclei and the overlap region ) . for their pdr models they used the results of @xcite . to make a more quantitative comparison , we have also run a grid of simulations using the same metallicity as they used , corresponding to standard milky way abundances .",
    "we found that by increasing the abundances above the milky way values , they act to lower the uv field needed to reproduce the observed line intensities .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that greater abundances compensate for the lower temperatures produced by weaker uv fields .",
    "due to its lack of a dipole moment , molecular hydrogen is not directly detectable at the low temperatures found in the bulk of the ism , and alternative methods have therefore been developed to trace it .",
    "the most common is through the so - called @xmath8 factor , in which the co emission is related to the column density of molecular hydrogen , @xmath85 , along a line of site , although early work by @xcite and recently by @xcite has found that in some instances atomic carbon might be a better tracer of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the theoretical definition of the @xmath8 is given by : @xmath86\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the denominator corresponds to the integrated antenna temperature of @xmath87 line .",
    "from fig.[fig : all ] we find that the best fit models must satisfy a relation between the density and the strength of the uv radiation field . as discussed earlier , low density regions may in principle interact with strong uv fields and higher density regions with weaker uv fields .",
    "given that the column density of molecular hydrogen and the integrated intensity of the co(10 ) line are computed by the pdr model along the line of sight into the cloud , we are able to produce a map of @xmath8 factor values as a function of parameter space for our grid of simulations .",
    "this map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xfactor ] .",
    "the contours correspond to @xmath88 ( see eqn.[eqn : xfactor ] ) . comparing the best - fit regions indicated by fig.[fig : all ] , we find a range of values for @xmath8 .",
    "for example , in the @xmath44uv region where the co lines converge ( i.e. @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , we find @xmath91 , which is less than the canonical milky way value of @xmath92@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the general trend in the @xmath8 values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xfactor ] is consistent with that found by @xcite .",
    "the x - factor decreases as the density rises , and increases as the uv field becomes stronger .",

    "the thick solid line corresponds to the canonical value of the milky way of @xmath94 .",
    "the ellipse corresponds to the best - fit area as obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "we argue that these are the best values of the @xmath95 factor to estimate the mass of molecular hydrogen , @xmath96 , in the different regions of ngc 4038.,width=340 ]",
    "for the simulations presented in this paper , the mass of a spherical cloud corresponding to a given one - dimensional slab model is determined by the equation : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the maximum depth reached in the pdr model , @xmath99 is its h - nucleus density , @xmath100 is the hydrogen mass , and @xmath101 is a mass correction factor to account for the contribution from helium and heavier elements .    given the cloud density ranges inferred from the co line ratios and the associated number of clouds required to reproduce the observed line intensities ( see  [ ssec : nclouds ] ) , we can derive estimates for the total mass of the molecular gas contained in these model clouds . adopting our maximum @xmath36 of 2 mag and the @xmath102 and @xmath103 values from table [ tab : nclouds ] , we find masses for individual clouds that vary from @xmath10410 @xmath105 up to @xmath9210@xmath106 @xmath105 , and total masses from all clouds of 10@xmath107 to 10@xmath108 @xmath34 .",
    "while we can immediately rule out some of the inferred model scenarios as being unphysical ( e.g. , those leading to individual cloud masses less than 10 @xmath34 ) , the range of total masses may form two extremes of the ism conditions .",
    "the low total mass estimates could indicate that the emission we are reproducing with our models comes from the surface layers of numerous , larger clouds , in which case these masses are those of the total gas contained in pdrs spread across the telescope beam .",
    "alternatively , the upper end of the total mass range is comparable to estimates of the total virial mass within ngc 4038 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , in which case our model clouds would represent the entirety of the molecular gas contained within this region , and consequently imply that _ all _ molecular gas resides within smaller , low @xmath36 clouds that fill the beam . for the best - fit region of parameter space described in  [ ssec :",
    "unified ] we find that the observed gas corresponds to a total mass of @xmath109 .",
    "this mass corresponds to the warmer pdr component only , and not to the total gas mass , which includes the cold component ( at @xmath110 ) deep within gmcs .",
    "we note that the larger total mass estimates come from the lower end of the density range we infer from the low-@xmath6 co line ratios , indicating that , under this scenario , the molecular gas is present within more typical gmcs of larger size and intermediate density",
    ". however , the higher densities that we infer from the high-@xmath6 co line ratios are more consistent with those implied by the fine structure lines , which would mean that the emission we are modelling is that of the uv - illuminated surfaces of larger cloud structures .",
    "regarding the adopted distance of @xmath111 @xcite described in the introduction of the present work , we note that @xcite have estimated a much smaller distance to the antennae of about @xmath112 . if we assumed the latter distance , we note that the results described in this paper would not be altered , as our basic model representation does not depend on the distance to ngc 4038 and thus would remain unaffected .",
    "this applies also to our derived cloud properties for the best - fit range of densities and uv field strangths .",
    "however , assuming a smaller distance would affect the determination of the molecular mass from the @xmath8 factor when using the total co(1 - 0 ) luminosity instead its integrated intensity .",
    "in this paper we use the 3d - pdr code to produce a grid of @xmath113 pdr models in order to understand the conditions of the ism occuring in the ngc 4038 nucleus of the antennae interacting galaxies complex , using observations of various lines taken from ground - based telescopes such as sest and cso , as well as from space telescopes such as _ herschel _ and _",
    "iso_.    the pdr clouds are considered to be one - dimensional slabs with uniform densities in the range @xmath114 , interacting with various plane - parallel interstellar radiation fields in the range @xmath115 .",
    "we have integrated all line intensities up to a cloud depth of @xmath56 .",
    "integrating to larger depths leads to absolute line intensities that are greater than the observed ones .",
    "we adopted solar abundances and used a subset of the most recent umist data base ( umist 2012 ) of rates and reactions .",
    "we analysed the model cloud emission in the and fine structure lines and eight co transition lines with @xmath4 up to @xmath116 .",
    "we find that the number of cloud surfaces needed to match the different co @xmath6 transitions varies , as different transitions will be tracing different gas components . for low-@xmath6 transitions we obtain a diagonal best - fit region extending from low densities and low uv field strengths to high densities and high uv field strengths . for high-@xmath6 transitions",
    "we find a weak dependence on the uv field and the best - fit region constrains the densities to be @xmath7 .",
    "since a fairly wide density range is needed to explain the co line intensities , we argue that using a single component model to explain all results is not meaningful , as it leads to large uncertainties in the derived properties .",

    "this range of total masses may correspond to two extremes of the ism conditions : the low total mass end would indicate emission from the surfaces of large clouds that suffer from beam dilution , while the high total mass end indicates that all molecular gas resides within smaller clouds that fill the beam .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained by fitting the co line intensities suggest that the mass of gas in pdrs corresponds to @xmath109 .    finally , we find that the co - to - h@xmath35 x - factor value is less than the canonical milky way value , in agreement with the values found for agn and other starburst galaxies @xcite .",
