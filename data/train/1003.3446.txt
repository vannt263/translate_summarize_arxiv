    "the formation history of massive galaxies is not well understood .",
    "present - day galaxies with stellar masses @xmath15are typically giant elliptical galaxies in the centers of galaxy groups .",
    "these galaxies have old stellar populations and follow tight scaling relations between their velocity dispersions , sizes , surface brightnesses , line strengths , and other parameters ( e.g. , djorgovski & davis 1987 ; thomas et  al . 2005 ) . at redshifts @xmath12 massive galaxies form a more complex population .",
    "a fraction of the population is forming stars at a high rate , as determined from their brightness in the rest - frame uv or ir , emission lines such as h@xmath16 , and other indicators ( e.g. , steidel et  al . 1996 ; blain et  al .",
    "2002 ; rubin et  al .",
    "2004 ; papovich et  al .",
    "2006 , and many other studies ) .",
    "however , others have no clear indications of ongoing star formation and have spectral energy distributions ( seds ) characterized by strong balmer- or 4000  breaks ( e.g. , daddi et  al . 2005 ; kriek et  al .",
    "the existence of these `` quiescent '' galaxies at this early epoch is in itself remarkable , and provides constraints on the accretion and thermodynamics of gas in massive halos at @xmath17 ( e.g. , kere et al .",
    "2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ) .",
    "what is perhaps even more surprising is that these galaxies are structurally very different from early - type galaxies in the nearby universe : their effective radii are typically 12kpc , much smaller than nearby giant ellipticals ( e.g. , daddi et  al . 2005 ; trujillo et  al .",

    "several explanations have been offered for the dramatic size difference between local massive galaxies and quiescent galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the simplest is that observers underestimated the sizes and/or overestimated the masses .",
    "although subtle errors are almost certainy present in the interpretation of the data , recent studies suggest that it is difficult to change the sizes and the masses by more than a factor of 1.5 , unless the imf is altered ( e.g. , muzzin et al .",
    "2009 , cassata et al .",
    "2010 , szomoru et al .",
    "other explanations include extreme mass loss due to a quasar - driven wind ( fan et  al .",
    "2008 ) , strong radial age gradients leading to large differences between mass - weighted and luminosity - weighted ages ( hopkins et  al . 2009",
    "; la barbera & de carvalho 2009 ) , star formation due to gas accretion ( franx et  al . 2008 ) , and selection effects ( e.g. , van dokkum et  al . 2008 ; van der wel et  al .",
    "perhaps the most plausible mechanism for bringing the compact @xmath12 galaxies onto the local mass - size relation is ( minor ) merging ( e.g. , bezanson et  al .",
    "2009 ; naab , johansson , & ostriker 2009 ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "2010 ; carrasco , conselice , & trujillo 2010 ) .",
    "numerical simulations predict that such mergers are frequent ( guo & white 2008 ; naab et  al .",
    "2009 ) ; furthermore , they may lead to stronger size growth than mass growth ( bezanson et  al .",
    "2009 ) . from an analysis of mass evolution at fixed number density , van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) infer that massive galaxies have doubled their mass since @xmath18 , and suggest that @xmath19% of this mass growth can be attributed to mergers .    although qualitatively consistent with observations and theory the minor merger scenario currently has little direct evidence to support it .",
    "it is also not clear whether properties other than sizes and masses are easily explained in this context ; one of the open questions is why present - day elliptical galaxies are so red and homogeneous if half of their mass was accreted from the general field at relatively recent times .",
    "ideally we would identify and study the infalling population directly at high redshift , but so far this has been hampered by the limitations of ground - based spectroscopy and ground- and space - based near - ir imaging .    in this _ letter _ , we use the exquisite wfc3 grism on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , in combination with wfc3 imaging , to study the environment of a quiescent compact galaxy at @xmath20 . as we show below",

    "the early release science ( ers ) wfc3 imaging observations of the goods - south field comprise a mosaic of eight hst pointings . all eight pointings",
    "were observed with a suite of imaging filters but only one was observed with the g102 and g141 grisms .",
    "the grism data are important for measuring the redshifts , ages , and star formation rates of massive galaxies at high redshift and indispensable for measuring the redshifts of any faint companion galaxies .",

    "we reduced the grism observations and extracted spectra using a combination of standard pyraf tasks ( e.g. , multidrizzle ) , the axe package ( kmmel et  al . 2009 ) , and custom scripts to improve background subtraction and optimize the extraction apertures ( see , e.g. , pirzkal et  al .",
    "the wavelength calibration and extraction apertures for g102 and g141 are based on undispersed images in @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",

    "the average rest - frame equivalent width of h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and h@xmath5 is 8@xmath7 , which implies that a post - starburst population dominates the rest - frame optical light .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population synthesis models ( see , e.g. , kriek et  al .",
    "good fits are obtained for populations with low star formation rates at the epoch of observation but relatively young luminosity - weighted ages ( @xmath8gyr ) , combined with a moderate amount of dust ( @xmath46 ) . adopting simple top - hat star formation histories",
    ", we find that the data can be fit with an extreme burst of @xmath47yr@xmath22 at @xmath48 ( purple ) , or with a star formation rate of @xmath49yr@xmath22 sustained over @xmath50gyr ( orange ) . in the latter model the star formation truncated only 150myr prior to the epoch of observation , comparable to the dynamical time at the distance of the companion galaxy .",
    "models with less dust and higher luminosity - weighted ages do not fit the spectrum well as they have stronger cah+k and weaker h@xmath5 absorption than is observed ; as an example , the red model in fig .",

    "we also extracted a spectrum of the companion galaxy from the grism data , even though it is quite faint at @xmath53 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spec.plot ] we clearly detect the continuum , thanks to the low background from space and the lack of sky lines .",

    "interestingly , the spectrum of the companion galaxy is redder than that of , although this is difficult to quantify due to contamination of its spectrum from a nearby object .",
    "this may be caused by dust and/or the presence of an old stellar population .",
    "as discussed in  1 , massive quiescent galaxies at @xmath12 typically have very small sizes . despite its spiral arms",
    "this is also the case for , as most of its light comes from a compact core .",
    "we quantified this by fitting sersic ( 1968 ) models to the @xmath11 image using galfit ( peng et  al .",
    "other objects in the field , including the companion galaxy , were masked in the fit .",
    "the fit and the residuals are shown in fig .",

    "the formal errors are very small ; the quoted uncertainties indicate the full range of solutions obtained when using different stars in the field as psfs , but do not include other sources of systematic error .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the s / n of the grism data is sufficiently high that we can compare the spectrum of the core to that at larger radii . as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d.plot ] the average spectrum of the inner 4 pixels ( @xmath59 ) is similar to that at large radii ( @xmath60 ) , with the notable exception of h@xmath3 : it is undetected away from the center , which implies that it is filled in by emission .",
    "we demonstrate this by subtracting the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model shown in fig .",
    "[ spec.plot ] from both the central spectrum and the outer spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the inner parts shows no systematic residuals , but the spectrum away from the center shows a positive residual at the wavelength of h@xmath3 .",
    "we infer that  is not entirely `` dead '' but is forming stars in the spiral arms .",
    "the amount of star formation is difficult to quantify and depends on the assumed reddening ; assuming @xmath61 it is @xmath62yr@xmath22 .",
    "the wfc3 grism and imaging data of  may provide `` smoking gun '' evidence for minor mergers as an important growth mechanism of massive galaxies :  is a massive , compact galaxy at @xmath12 which is interacting with a @xmath63 less massive companion .",
    "the quiescent spectrum of the primary galaxy is qualitatively consistent with the spectra of other compact high redshift galaxies and with the old stellar ages of present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "this mode of growth has been proposed by several recent studies to explain the size difference between massive galaxies at high redshift and low redshift ( e.g. , bezanson et  al .",
    "2009 ; naab et  al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "nearby ellipticals have gradients in their color and metallicity , such that they are bluer and more metal - poor at larger radii ( e.g. , franx , illingworth , & heckman 1989 ) .",
    "interestingly , we can begin to address the origin of these gradients with the kind of data that we are now getting from hst .",
    "the relatively strong oxygen lines and weak h@xmath3 of the infalling galaxy imply @xmath64 , and a metallicity that is @xmath65 times the solar value ( pilyugin & thuan 2005 ) .",
    "the spectrum extracted from the disk of  has , by contrast , no detected oxygen lines and an unambiguous detection of h@xmath3 .",
    "it has @xmath66 , which implies a solar or super - solar metallicity .",
    "qualitatively these results are consistent with the idea that the metallicity gradients of elliptical galaxies reflect a gradual increase with radius in the fraction of stars that came from infalling low - mass satellites .",
    "the apparent absence of star formation in the central regions of might be related to its active nucleus .",
    "it has been suggested by many authors that agn could prevent gas cooling and star formation ( e.g. , croton et  al .",
    "2006 ) and in this context the observed properties of , such as the lower limit on the ratio of its x - ray luminosity to [ oiii ] and h@xmath3 , may provide constraints on the mechanism(s ) of agn feedback ( see also fiore et  al .",
    "2008 ; kriek et  al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) . in any case , the fact that both interacting galaxies host an agn is remarkable , as it demonstrates that their black holes are undergoing a `` growth spurt '' prior to their merger .",
    "we note here that the only indication of the agns in the optical and near - ir is a faint emission line in the vimos spectra of , which we now identify as civ .",

    "there is evidence for star formation in the companion ( although its emission lines could be influenced by its active nucleus ) and also in the spiral arms of . in most models",
    "such `` residual '' star formation takes place in the center of the most massive galaxy ( see , e.g. , naab et  al .",
    "2009 ) , but that is in fact the only place where we do _ not _ see evidence for star formation .",
    "we note , however , that because of the large mass of  the specific star formation rate of the entire system is low at sfr / m@xmath67@xmath68yr@xmath22 .",
    "second , although the spectrum of  resembles those of the compact galaxies studied in kriek et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) and van dokkum et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the galaxy formed its stars at significantly lower redshift . as shown in  3",
    "its star formation rate probably was @xmath49yr@xmath22 as recently as @xmath69myr prior to the epoch of observation , i.e. , at @xmath70 .",
    "it is therefore not a direct descendant of quiescent galaxies at @xmath71 .",
    "interestingly , star forming galaxies at @xmath17 are typically larger than  in the rest - frame optical ( e.g. , toft et  al .",
    "2007 ) , which may imply that  is unusual or that a significant fraction of the star formation in massive galaxies at @xmath72 takes place in heavily obscured , compact regions .",
    "third , the fact that the time since the truncation of star formation is similar to the dynamical time calls into question whether we are witnessing a `` two - stage '' galaxy formation process , with steady accretion of satellite galaxies following an initial highly dissipational star formation phase ( e.g. , naab et  al .",
    "2009 ; dekel et  al .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the companion galaxy is somehow related to the truncation , for example by triggering the agn in  @xmath73myr ago .",
    "numerical simulations that aim to reproduce both the 2d spectrum and the morphological features might shed some light on these issues . as illustrated in this _ letter _",
