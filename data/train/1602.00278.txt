    "the usefulness of anomalies is partially related to the fact that they are exact and can be determined at strong coupling .",
    "this is a consequence of certain non - renormalization properties and allows nonperturbative insight .",
    "indeed abj axial anomaly can be captured perturbatively by one - loop feynmann diagram . however , the result is non - perturbative , being exact from low to high energies since the anomaly reflects the spectral flow at all scales .",
    "recently son and yamamoto derived an anomaly matching condition which relates the @xmath1 avv triangle anomaly @xcite , fig.([anomaly3 ] ) , to the two - point vv and aa current functions , where v refers to vector current and a to the axial current .",
    "the result was obtained via holography and can be regarded as a non - perturbative exact relation between three- and two - point current functions .",
    "they used a five - dimensional yang - mills action of holographic dual of qcd and considered a holographic mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking via the boundary conditions for the gauge fields in the infrared .",

    "like in holographic qcd dual action can be considered as the worldvolume action on the probe flavor brane therefore it involves the 3d yang - mills and chern - simons terms .",
    "the duals of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional systems in this approach have been considered in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the case of the single flavor in the boundary nonabelian gauge theory at large n. the cigar geometry implies that like in 4 + 1 case we have to consider left and right copies of the gauge group in the 3d bulk theory reflecting the global @xmath2 symmetry at the boundary .",
    "the 2d qcd enjoys the chiral symmetry breaking @xcite via chiral condensate formation .",
    "there is the pion - like degree of freedom whose mass is related with the fermion mass via analog of the gor relation .",
    "there is some important difference between the 4 + 1 and 2 + 1 bulk gauge theories .",
    "the son - yamamoto relation has been derived in 5-dim theory taking into account that the contribution of cs terms is suppressed by the large t - hooft coupling .",
    "therefore it was possible first consider the equation of motion without cs term derive the constant wronskian condition and then treat the cs term as a kind of perturbation .",
    "the situation in 2 + 1 is different and there is no any suppression of cs term anymore which is crucial for the imposing the self - consistent boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore we have to consider the equation of motion including the cs terms which have the opposite signs for the left and right fields .",
    "therefore there is no naive constant wronskian condition and therefore naive 1 + 1 analog of son - yamamoto relation .",
    "however the numerical analysis of the equations of motion demonstrates that the wronskian exhibits a platoe in the very wide interval of the radial holographic coordinate and the transition to the platoe is very sharp .",
    "one could also have in mind the formal regime when ym terms dominate .",
    "therefore we can explore the constant wronskian condition with some reservations in 2 + 1 case as well .",

    "we obtain from the son - yamamoto relation an estimate for the pion decay constant .",
    "we note that it is derived in the region when the application of the low - energy theory is questionable .",
    "hence this result should be taken with some reservation and deserves the additional study .",
    "an additional question concerns rg flow of our holographic model .",
    "this question is related to renormalization and regularization of effective theories in holography , that was solved along two avenues .",
    "first is the method of standard holographic renormalization that involves the cancellation of all cut - off related divergences from the gravity on - shell action by adding the counterterms on the cut - off boundary surface and the subsequent removal of cut - off @xcite .",
    "holographic renormalization has been used in calculation of two - point functions in deformed cft @xcite . in parallel development , the hamilton - jacobi equation was advocated to use for renormalization in order to separate terms in the bulk on - shell action , which can be written as local functions of boundary data .",
    "the remaining non - local expression was identified , according to the ads / cft prescription , with the generating functional of a boundary field theory @xcite . in hamilton - jacobi equation",
    "the bulk radial coordinate is treated as the time variable , which is consistent with holographic identification of radial coordinate with rg energy scale .",
    "the second approach provides correct results for anomalies and gives a simple description of rf flow in deformed cft s @xcite .",

    "this means that in the limit @xmath215 in order to get one- and two - point functions of the currents , we calculate correlators for the two - dimensional fermions , and then sum over the fermi zero modes using the density of states in the lll @xmath241 and schematically @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are fermion currents in @xmath203d and @xmath3d , respectively .",

    "instead a different state described approximately by tomanaga - luttinger theory @xcite is generated .",
