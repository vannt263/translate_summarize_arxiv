    "phase transitions , critical phenomena , and the corresponding critical exponents are fundamental topics in statistical mechanics .",
    "though they should have a close relation with critical points of maps  @xcite , catastrophe theory  @xcite , and singularity theory  @xcite in mathematics , there is little application to these simple physical problems . in these geometrical standpoints",
    ", it is natural to expect critical points to be singularities on a certain surface or a curve . a critical phenomenon , accompanied by the hamilton - jacobi structure , is simply visualized in the present paper .",
    "we take ising model in the mean field approximation as an example .",
    "relations between thermodynamics and hamilton - jacobi theory have been discussed for many years  @xcite .",
    "however , they are mostly considered under the quasi - static conditions . among them , one notable proposal was offered by suzuki  @xcite .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics can be considered as a variational principle that determines reversible or irreversible processes .",
    "he recognized a finsler structure in the variational principle , and identified the equation of state , or the virial relation , as the constraint which inevitably arises in the finsler - lagrangian formulation  @xcite , and derived a hamilton - jacobi structure .",
    "the idea was supplemented by one of the authors  @xcite .    following suzuki s method ,",
    "we review the finsler - lagrangian formulation in the next section . in section 3",
    ", we apply this method to the mean field ising model and show several graphs which reveal singularities at the critical points .",
    "here , we review a finsler geometrical formulation of lagrangian formalism , which we call finsler - lagrangian formulation  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a configuration space and @xmath1 be a lagrangian .",
    "it is well known that the lagrangian @xmath2 constructs a finsler metric @xmath3 on the extended configuration space @xmath4 as @xmath5 the set @xmath6 becomes @xmath7-dimensional finsler manifold .",
    "this technique is known as homogenization technique . in mathematics ,",
    "finsler metric should satisfy several conditions  @xcite , which are too strong for physical applications .",
    "we only assume 1 )  homogeneity of @xmath3 and 2 )  domain of @xmath3 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a subbundle of @xmath10 where @xmath3 and its derivative is well defined .",
    "time evolutions of the system are represented by oriented curves @xmath11 on the extended configuration space @xmath12 .",
    "the action of the lagrangian system is defined by a line integral of @xmath13 along an oriented curve @xmath14 @xmath15=\\int_{\\bm{c } } f:=\\int_{\\tau_0}^{\\tau_1 }    f\\left(x^\\mu(\\tau),\\frac{dx^\\mu}{d\\tau}(\\tau)\\right)d\\tau,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is an arbitrary parameter of @xmath17 . by homogeneity condition 1 ) , @xmath18 $ ] does not depend on the choice of the parametrization .",
    "the variational principle @xmath19=\\int_{\\tau_0}^{\\tau_1 } \\left\\ {   { \\frac{\\partial { f}}{\\partial { x^\\mu } } } \\delta x^\\mu+{\\frac{\\partial { f}}{\\partial { dx^\\mu } } } \\frac{d\\delta x^\\mu}{d\\tau }   \\right\\ } d\\tau   = \\int_{\\tau_0}^{\\tau_1 } \\left\\ {   { \\frac{\\partial { f}}{\\partial { x^\\mu}}}-\\frac{d}{d\\tau } \\left({\\frac{\\partial { f}}{\\partial { dx^\\mu}}}\\right )   \\right\\ } \\delta x^\\mu d\\tau,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leads to a covariant euler - lagrange equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the important fact is the covariant euler - lagrange equation is parametrization invariant .",
    "the homogeneity condition 1 ) is equivalent to the euler s formula @xmath25 and differentiating it with respect to @xmath26 on both sides , we have @xmath27 where we define a covariant conjugate momentum @xmath28 ( [ noleg ] ) indicates the matrix @xmath29 does not have the inverse matrix .",
    "the inverse function theorem promises that there exists at least one constraint @xmath30 among the variables @xmath31 .",
    "when we consider a relativistic free particle on an @xmath7 dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath32 , we can take a finsler metric on @xmath12 as @xmath33 in this case , we have a constraint @xmath34 for a non - relativistic particle under a potential force , the corresponding finsler metric is @xmath35 and we get @xmath36 as a constraint .",
    "hamilton s principal function @xmath37 is defined as a line integral along a solution curve of ( [ el - eq ] ) , @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is a solution curve connecting between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath42 is fixed , @xmath37 can be considered as a function on @xmath12 : @xmath43 . an infinitesimal transformation @xmath44 which acts only the neighborhood of @xmath45 leads to @xmath46 for arbitrary @xmath47 . here",
    ", @xmath48 stands for the quantity @xmath49 contracted by the velocity @xmath50 at @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the principal function @xmath51 admits the relation @xmath52 the constraint @xmath53 becomes @xmath54 this is the covariant expression of the hamilton - jacobi equation , which is necessarily derived from the homogeneity condition 1 ) in the finsler - lagrangian formulation .",
    "let @xmath55 be the quantity of heat flowing into the system from the environment of temperature @xmath56 during an infinitesimal process , and @xmath57 be the difference of entropy between the initial and final equilibrium states .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics can be written as @xmath58 if equality is satisfied , the thermal process is reversible .",
    "on the other hand , inequality represents irreversible process .",
    "we will assume the right - hand side is supposed to be given by an integration of some finsler metric defined on thermodynamic state space @xmath59  @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a thermal process which is represented by an oriented curve on @xmath12 .",
    "reversible processes maximize this integral .",
    "integral of @xmath62 on a reversible process @xmath61 becomes the entropy difference between @xmath63 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 and the maximal ( stationary ) integral of the rhs of ( [ thermofin ] ) gives the hamilton s principal function @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the hamilton s principal function in thermodynamics is identical to the entropy function : @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we get the relation @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are conjugate momenta of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and the third equality of ( [ dw = ds ] ) is the first law of thermodynamics . from the above equation ( [ dw = ds ] )",
    ", we can conclude the covariant conjugate momenta of @xmath72 are @xmath73 the constraint from the finsler - lagrangian formulation @xmath53 turns into an equation : @xmath74 suzuki found out that this is the virial relation in thermodynamic system .    in the case of the ideal gas , it has the internal energy @xmath75 and the equation of state @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number of the gas particles , @xmath78 the boltzmann constant , @xmath79 temperature , @xmath80 pressure , @xmath71 volume of the gas .",
    "its virial relation is @xmath81 with ( [ eq2 - 16 ] ) , it becomes @xmath82 from this virial equation and @xmath83 we can derive following hamilton - jacobi equation of the ideal gas : @xmath84 the solution of the partial differential equation ( [ ideal ] ) gives the entropy of the ideal gas @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are constants . using ( [ puspvs ] ) , we also have @xmath88 which reproduce the internal energy and state equation of the ideal gas .",
    "it is believed that the definition of the ideal gas needs both relations .",
    "however , the procedure of this section tells that only the virial relation is needed , and through the hamilton - jacobi equation , the rest follows .",
    "we apply the formulation reviewed in section 2 to a spin system .",
    "the hamiltonian of ising model in the mean field approximation is expressed as @xmath89 when there is no magnetic field . here",

    "@xmath96 is a parameter related to the fluctuation of the total magnetization @xmath97 , and is proportional to the external magnetic field @xmath98 . throughout this section ,",
    "we assume @xmath96 to be nonzero , since an infinitesimally small magnetic field is necessary for the phase transition .",
    "the grand massieu function @xmath99 , which is a function of @xmath100 and @xmath96 , generates the magnetization @xmath12 and the internal energy @xmath70 as @xmath101 the equation is the self - consistent equation and gives a relation between @xmath70 and @xmath12 which should be kept all the time .",

    "the energy change should be given by @xmath107 thus , we have @xmath108 .    the self - consistent equation is a candidate for virial relation .",
    "however , it should not contain the statistical quantity @xmath77 inherently , since virial relation is a concept of thermodynamics . from the relation",
    ", we have @xmath109 which should take a value between @xmath110 . substituting it into to get rid of @xmath77",
    ", we obtain our virial equation for the mean field ising model : @xmath111 it transforms into @xmath112 after substituting the derivatives of @xmath113 for @xmath114 in ( [ sce2 ] ) using ( [ par ] ) .",
    "this is the hamilton - jacobi equation for the ising model in mean field approximation .    by solving the partial differential equation directly , assuming homogeneity of @xmath113 with respect to @xmath115",
    ", we find the general solution for the entropy as @xmath116 where @xmath63 is an arbitrary constant . the last term is set to be a linear function of @xmath117 because of the extensive property of the entropy .",
    "when @xmath70 takes a value 0 , this term pushes the entropy out to infinity , which makes it unphysical . therefore we choose @xmath118 for a physical solution .",
    "its @xmath115-dependence is illustrated in fig .",
    "the vacant region in the middle indicates the non - allowed combination of @xmath70 and @xmath12 to be an argument of @xmath119 .     and",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath120).,width=302 ]    after evaluating and substituting , we obtain @xmath121 by substituting the above relations , the entropy becomes @xmath122 which is identical to what is derived from except for a constant term .",
    "the expression , or - , has much more information than , since @xmath100 and @xmath96 are parametlized by @xmath92 .",
    "it produces a curve in @xmath123 space as shown in fig .",

[ energy ] ) to see a drastic change in the energy at the critical point .",

    "all these exponents are the same as the standard results .",
    "an exact solution for the higher - dimensional ising model with non - zero magnetic field would define an exotic surface as the cusp catastrophe surface in @xmath147 space by considering the equation @xmath148 .",
