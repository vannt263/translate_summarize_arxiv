    "the study of connections between random matrix theory and properties of the riemann zeta function , @xmath5 , has known recently significant developments @xcite .",
    "a central point is hugh montgomery s ( generalized ) conjecture @xcite that in the asymptotic limit ( high on the critical line for @xmath6 ) the fluctuation properties of non - trivial riemann zeros are the same as for the circular unitary ensemble ( @xmath7 ) of @xmath8 random unitary matrices ( with haar measure ) in the limit of large dimensionality , @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the normalized pair correlation function of the riemann zeros with @xmath10 is conjectured to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unfolded distance between zeros ( i.e. the mean spacing is set to one ) .",
    "andrew odlyzko , since the late 70 s , started accurate and extensive numerical computations of riemann zeros in order to check this and other conjectures @xcite .",
    "his main result is that in the limit @xmath10 correlation functions of riemann zeros do agree with random matrix predictions .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) the density distribution @xmath13 of spacings among consecutive zeros of @xmath5 ( called the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution in random matrix literature ) is plotted for a billion zeros around the @xmath14-th zero .",
    "the agreement with the cue asymptotic prediction @xmath15 ( represented by a solid line in that figure ) is remarkable .",
    "it is interesting to look at the difference @xmath16 between the computed and the conjectured distributions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) . though the difference is small ( of order @xmath17 ) it has a clear structure with a nontrivial @xmath12 dependence .",
    "one may wonder how this difference compares with the one obtained , within random matrix theory , between the asymptotic and a finite @xmath18 calculation .",
    "to proceed , one needs a criterion for the size of the matrix to compare with .",
    "the simplest assumption is to choose @xmath19 , where @xmath20 this matrix size is obtained by equating the local density of zeros at height @xmath2 along the critical line to the density of eigenvalues of the @xmath21 unitary matrix @xcite .",
    "= 6.7 in = 2.5 in    [ fig1 ]    this dimensional correspondence has been successful when comparing statistical properties of @xmath22 at finite @xmath2 with those of characteristic polynomials of @xmath7 matrices of size @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the riemann zeros in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are located in a window around @xmath23 , which gives @xmath24 .",
    "the difference between the finite @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) and the asymptotic nearest neighbour spacing distributions is represented by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "though the functional form of the correction is qualitatively correct , its amplitude is clearly too small ( by a factor of order 20 ) . in his paper @xcite ,",
    "a. odlyzko commented : clearly there is structure in the difference graph , and the challenge is to understand where it comes from. the purpose of this note is to provide some elements in this direction .",
    "let us first analyze the corrections to the asymptotic two  point function ( [ r2gue ] ) for @xmath21 random matrices from the circular unitary ensemble @xmath25 and for zeros of the riemann zeta function .",
    "the comparison between them will provide an effective set of rules or correspondences between both sequences .",
    "we start first with random matrix theory . for @xmath18-dimensional unitary matrices",
    "the @xmath26point correlation functions are given by @xcite @xmath27 @xmath28 is the corresponding kernel , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 in particular , the unfolded two  point correlation function takes the form @xmath32 the expansion ( [ kern ] ) leads to @xmath33 this formula expresses the correlation function as the asymptotic result eq .",
    "( [ r2gue ] ) plus corrections proportional to inverse even powers of the matrix dimension .",
    "notice that the corresponding expansion for random hermitian matrices ( gaussian unitary ensemble ) is different , it is non  analytic and includes a term proportional to @xmath34 ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "we now need an equivalent result for the riemann zeros .",
    "an heuristic formula for the two - point correlation function for these zeros was obtained by bogomolny and keating in ref.@xcite using the hardy - littlewood conjecture for the distribution of prime pairs ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "it states that the two - point correlation function of riemann zeros , @xmath35 , is the sum of three terms @xmath36 where the smooth density of zeros , @xmath37 , is asymptotically @xmath38 and the diagonal , @xmath39 , and off - diagonal , @xmath40 , parts are given by the following convergent expressions @xmath41\\ ] ] and @xmath42 + { \\rm c. c. } \\ .\\ ] ] here the summation and the product are taken over all primes @xmath43 . in @xcite it was checked that these formulas agree very well with odlyzko s results for the two - point correlation function of riemann zeros .",
    "the unfolded two  point correlation function is obtained by measuring distances between zeros in units of the local mean spacing , @xmath44 we are interested in the corrections to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath45 in the limit when @xmath1 . in this limit @xmath46 and the argument of @xmath47 in eq.([r2u ] ) becomes small ( keeping @xmath12 finite ) .",
    "therefore , one can expand @xmath35 for @xmath48 . to perform the expansion",
    "it is convenient to use the known series @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the stieljes constants , and the following auxiliary expansions : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 = 1 + c_0 \\epsilon^2 + { { \\rm i}}q \\ \\epsilon^3 + { \\cal o } ( \\epsilon^4)\\ ] ] with @xmath54    collecting the different terms in the expansion , one gets @xmath55 and @xmath56 { { \\rm e}}^{{{\\rm i}}2 \\pi { \\overline{\\rho}}\\epsilon } + { \\rm c. c.}\\ .\\ ] ] the unfolded two  point correlation function takes therefore the form @xmath57 equation ( [ r2r1 ] ) expresses the two  point correlation function of riemann zeros as the asymptotic random matrix result given by eq .",
    "( [ r2gue ] ) , plus corrections that are proportional to inverse powers of the average density of zeros .",
    "the comparison of eqs.([r2cue ] ) and ( [ r2r1 ] ) shows that the leading terms coincide , as conjectured by montgomery . to relate sub - leading terms we proceed as follows .",
    "up to @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ r2r1 ] ) , the term of @xmath59 can be absorbed in the term of @xmath60 by rescaling the @xmath12 variable .",
    "equation ( [ r2r1 ] ) now takes the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ r2cue ] ) and ( [ r2r2 ] ) leads to the following conclusions :    * to leading order in @xmath64 the two  point correlation function of the riemann zeros coincides with that of eigenvalues of random @xmath7 matrices of effective dimension @xmath65 , where @xmath66 where @xmath67 . *",
    "the next - to - leading order is obtained by rescaling the variable @xmath12 in the first correction term according to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by eq.([alpha ] ) .",
    "the effective matrix size obtained from our analysis is , therefore , different from @xmath70 ( eq .  ( [ n0 ] ) ) , the relation between them being a multiplicative factor @xmath71 .",
    "in general , to compute the nearest  neighbour spacing distribution it is necessary to know correlation functions of arbitrary number of points .",
    "though for the riemann zeros the hardy - littlewood conjecture is sufficient to obtain all correlation functions @xcite , the computations are cumbersome and for simplicity we shall use another method .    for cue , the nearest",
    " neighbour spacing distribution may be expressed as @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 \\ , 1 \\leq j , k \\leq n \\ .\\ ] ]    some physical arguments @xcite indicate that to leading order , under quite general conditions deviations from standard random matrix theory in systems with no time reversal symmetry are reduced to a change of the kernel only , and that the correction term is the same as for @xmath7 matrices with an effective matrix size .",
    "= 6.6 in = 2.4 in    [ figg2 ]    if we accept this conjecture then from the results of the previous section it follows that to leading order _ all _ correlation functions of the riemann zeros are the same as those of @xmath7 matrices with effective dimension given by eq .",

    "in particular , it means that the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution of the riemann zeros can be calculated as follows .",
    "first , find the expansion of the nearest ",
    "neighbour distribution for @xmath7 random unitary matrices in inverse powers of @xmath18 , namely @xmath74 ( the fact that the first correction is of order @xmath75 follows from results in @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion ( [ pscue ] ) is difficult to derive analytically .",
    "we have therefore computed numerically the spacing distribution @xmath76 from eqs .",
    "( [ psdef]-[enofs ] ) .",
    "the correction term is then obtained by computing @xmath77 $ ] for increasing values of @xmath18 .",
    "an alternative method would be to use a non - linear differential equation for @xmath78 as derived in @xcite .",

    "( [ pscue ] ) @xmath18 by @xmath79 given by eq .",
    "( [ neff ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall approximate the next - to - leading correction of @xmath80 according to the rule ( [ sca ] ) .",
    "in such an approximation the nearest ",
    "neighbour spacing distribution of the riemann zeros equals the universal random matrix result , @xmath81 , plus the correction @xmath82 , where @xmath83 @xmath79 and @xmath69 are given by eq .",
