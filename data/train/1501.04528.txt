    "whether diagonal long range orders [ such as charge - density - wave ( cdw ) and spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ] and off - diagonal long range orders [ such as superconducting and superfluid ( sf ) states ] can coexist homogeneously in correlated electronic systems is a central issue in condensed matter physics .",
    "coexistence of superconductivity and cdw has been studied in three - dimensional systems @xcite ( such as @xmath1 doped with @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) , quasi - two - dimensional systems @xcite ( such as the dichalcogenide @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite ( such as the trichalcogenide @xmath6 and doped spin ladder @xmath7 ) .",
    "supersolidity , defined as homogeneous coexistence of superfluidity and crystalline order , was theoretically proposed more than 4 decades ago @xcite and has been a subject of debate since then .",
    "the first experimental claim @xcite of observing supersolidity in helium-4 further intensified the debate and enhanced the interest in understanding the phenomena .",
    "the general consensus @xcite is that a supersolid ( ss ) is not realizable in a perfect hcp crystal of @xmath8 ; nevertheless , superflow can occur along vacancies that can collect near extended structural defects @xcite .",
    "thus , the occurrence of supersolidity in bulk solid helium-4 is being seriously questioned .",
    "cold - atom systems offer another opportunity for realization of supersolidity .",
    "theoretically @xcite , lattice bosons with various types of interactions in diverse geometries have yielded supersolidity .",
    "however , there has been no experimental creation of optical lattices with effective long - range interactions that produce supersolidity .",
    "furthermore , experimental techniques to detect signatures of supersolidity also need to be developed for optical lattices @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous studies of supersolidity involving hard - core - bosons ( hcbs ) @xcite . a lattice model for quantum liquids , such as",
    "the interacting bosonic helium-4 at low temperatures , needs a hard - core constraint to account for the exclusion of occupation of more than one atom at each lattice point @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the ground state and low temperature excitations of such systems are largely controlled by couplings with phonons .",
    "furthermore , local cooper pairs [ comprising of two electrons ( of opposite spin ) at a site ] can also be regarded as hcbs @xcite . in bismuthates , such hcbs couple to the breathing mode of the oxygen cage surrounding the bismuth ions @xcite .    here , in this article , we study a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose - holstein ( bh ) model for hcbs on a square lattice where they can hop to nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites and experience the hcb - phonon interactions via a holstein - type term .",
    "previously , exact diagonalization calculations were done on this model @xcite for a small system ( i.e. , @xmath9 lattice ) to study the resulting phase diagram .",
    "here we use stochastic - series - expansion ( sse ) based quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique to simulate large - size lattices so that various phases in the thermodynamic limit can be identified more clearly . unlike the @xmath10 model , a ss is realized in our bh system due to non - negligible transport within the same sublattice . at densities",
    "not far from half - filling and at sufficiently large hcb - phonon couplings , phase coexistence occurs ; furthermore , in the phase - coexistence region , the system tends to phase separate at stronger couplings .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with a discussion of the bh hamiltonian , its transformations and its mapping to the equivalent spin model .",
    "section iii covers a description of the numerical method and the observables employed to characterize the orderings . in section iv , we detail our results and the corresponding analysis , both with and without the presence of same - sublattice hopping terms .",
    "lastly , in section v , we summarize our results and draw conclusions .",
    "the bh hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the annihilation operators for phonons and hcb particles , respectively , and @xmath14 @xmath15 is the number operator for hcbs at site @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 is the amplitude for hopping at nn sites denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the frequency of optical phonons @xcite .",
    "an effective hamiltonian for the hcb particles is obtained by first transforming this bh hamiltonian to the polaronic frame of reference ( using the lang - firsov transformation ) and then performing perturbation theory as detailed in refs . .",
    "interestingly , second - order perturbation theory yields a two - step hopping which produces , in a 2d square lattice , both next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) and next - to - next - nearest neighbor ( nnnn ) hopping terms besides the usual nn hopping term in the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , a nn repulsion also results from two - step virtual hopping back and forth .",
    "so we get an effective @xmath20 hamiltonian for hcb particles on a 2d square lattice @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote nnn and nnnn sites respectively ; @xmath24exp@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 $ ] ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] . in the regime @xmath31 , we can make the approximations @xmath32 and @xmath33 \\sim \\frac{e^{2g^2}}{2g^2}$ ] with the approximations becoming exact for @xmath34 .",
    "the small parameter is @xmath35 and is obtained from @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] ( see ref . for details ) ; our perturbation analysis is done in the nonadiabatic regime ( @xmath37 ) and at strong coupling ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "since all the hoppings are non - frustrated , a qmc simulation of the system does not suffer from the negative sign problem .",
    "we employ sse technique in our qmc simulation and investigate the co - existence or competition of cdw and superfluidity in various regimes of the parameter space . here",
    "we should mention that our @xmath20 model for hcbs is equivalent to an extended xxz spin-1/2 hamiltonian as shown below : @xmath38 + \\nonumber\\\\&\\frac{j_{2xy}}{2}\\sum_{<<i , j>>}(s_i^+s_j^-+{\\rm h.c.})+\\nonumber\\\\ & \\frac{j_{3xy}}{2}\\sum_{<<<i , j>>>}(s_i^+s_j^-+{\\rm h.c.})-h_0\\sum_is_i^z , \\label{xxz_ext}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 stand for nn , nnn , and nnnn pairs respectively .",

    "a large interaction strength suggests the possibility of a cdw .",
    "thus , our objective is to study the compatibility of these two long range orders .",
    "now , these two orders can coexist either in a phase separated form or homogeneously as a ss .",
    "it should be pointed out that , a @xmath10 model on a square lattice does not show a thermodynamically stable ss phase for hcbs @xcite . on the other hand , striped ss behavior is found away from half filling when nnn repulsion ( @xmath55 ) is considered in the @xmath56 model@xcite .",
    "we now give details of the sse - qmc simulation of our @xmath20 model , or equivalently , our extended xxz spin-1/2 model . finding the phase diagram in the present problem requires exploring various limits of the parameters ( including high anisotropy in our spin model ) . in our numerical computations ,",
    "we used directed loop update for efficient sampling of the configurations @xcite .",
    "the ground state properties are captured by simulating at low enough temperatures , i.e. , @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the linear dimension of the square lattice@xcite .",

    "this is necessary so that they can be treated as probabilities .",
    "the value of @xmath61 can also affect the autocorrelation time of the desired variable .",
    "we found that keeping the numerical value of @xmath61 equal to at least a quarter of the anisotropy parameter @xmath62 , particularly near the transition region , helps keep the data in various bins uncorrelated when each bin contains data from large number of monte carlo sweeps ( i.e. , at least 15,00,000 ) ; for the value of @xmath61 used in the xxz model , see ref .",
    ".    in this work we are concerned with the diagonal order parameter @xmath63 [ i.e , the structure factor at the neel ordering vector @xmath0 ] and the off - diagonal order parameter of the sf density @xmath65 . a general expression for @xmath66 ( for our hcb system ) is given as @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the ensemble average . since @xmath14 ( or @xmath69 in our spin model ) are diagonal in the basis ,",

    "we consider @xmath84 in the present study .    to obtain the phase diagram for our system , the interplay between the diagonal and off - diagonal orders and the transition between them needs thorough investigation .",

    "the magnitude of the jump increases as the coupling @xmath96 increases .",

    "a histogram analysis can also capture the jump in @xmath78 values . in fig .",
    "[ figure 3](b ) , plotted for @xmath100 , the @xmath78 histograms change when magnetic field values are varied .",

    "[ figure 3](b ) ] .",
    "then , at a slightly higher magnetic field of @xmath104 , all the @xmath78 values seem to be centered around a mean value close to 0.18 .",

    "[ tab1 ] , at intermediate values of @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath106 ) , nnn hopping is comparable to nn hopping ; consequently , a ss state can occur .",
    "whereas at larger values of @xmath96 ( i.e. , for @xmath107 ) , nnn hopping is fairly smaller than nn hopping and we can expect the same behavior as in the @xmath10 ( or the xxz ) model . on account of particle - hole symmetry in our model ,",
    "the phase diagram is symmetric about half - filling .",
    "we will now examine various features of the phase diagram of fig .",

    "the variation of magnetization with magnetic field in a @xmath95 lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure 6 ] in the transition region .",
    "the results for @xmath108 show that the magnetization increases gradually without any jump as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "hence , in fig .  [ figure 6](a ) , for @xmath109 cdw and sf phases coexist homogeneously resulting in a ss state .",
    "here we must mention that fig .",
    "[ figure 1](a ) ( depicting simultaneous coexistence of cdw and sf phases through non - zero values of @xmath63 and @xmath65 ) corroborates this conclusion .    as a matter of fact , large anisotropy [ i.e. , large values of @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) ] in the model requires large simulation time .",
    "thus , as we increase the value of @xmath96 and thereby increase the value of @xmath111 or @xmath112 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , the numerical calculation suffers from appreciable slowing down and with our computational constraints we can not study for large values of @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath113 ) .",
    "we can set a cut - off for the anisotropy parameter @xmath114 above which the essential physics for the system does not change much ; for values of @xmath115 above the cut - off , we expect that nn occupancy is in effect projected out .",
    "more precisely , we find that we can deal with large values of @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) by setting @xmath117 and still get the correct behavior of the observables thereby saving computational time . fig .",

    ", a change in the anisotropy parameter @xmath120 can be shown to produce an additional effective field of @xmath121 ( at the mean - field level ) .",
    "so in fig .",
    "[ figure 4](a ) , we shifted the @xmath50 scale accordingly in an attempt to make the @xmath78 plots coincide .",
    "the good agreement between the two cases for @xmath122 and @xmath123 gives us the freedom to use a cut - off of @xmath124 at large values of @xmath96 ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) .",

    "<S> exploring supersolidity in naturally occurring and artificially designed systems has been and will continue to be an area of immense interest . here , we study how superfluid and charge - density - wave ( cdw ) states cooperate or compete in a minimal model for hard - core - bosons ( hcbs ) coupled locally to optical phonons : a two - dimensional bose - holstein model . </S>",
    "<S> our study is restricted to the parameter regimes of strong hcb - phonon coupling and non - adiabaticity . </S>",
    "<S> we use quantum monte carlo simulation ( involving stochastic - series - expansion technique ) to study phase transitions and to investigate whether we have homogeneous or phase - separated coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian involves , besides a nearest - neighbor hopping and a nearest - neighbor repulsion , sizeable double - hopping terms ( obtained from second - order perturbation ) . at densities </S>",
    "<S> not far from half - filling , in the parameter regime where the double - hopping terms are non - negligible ( negligible ) compared to the nearest - neighbor hopping , we get checkerboard - supersolidity ( phase separation ) with cdw being characterized by ordering wavevector @xmath0 . </S>"
