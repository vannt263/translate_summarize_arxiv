    "sne  iib show strong hydrogen lines around the time of their maximum brightness , but later these lines become weak or even disappear , while he  i lines develop .",
    "sne  ib develop strong he  i lines after maximum , while hydrogen lines are weak or absent .",

    ".    two recent papers ( matheson et al . 2001 , hereafter m01 ; branch et al 2002 , hereafter b02 ) have advanced our understanding of sn  ib and ic spectra .",
    "m01 presented a large number of optical spectra of sne  ib and ic , and were able to clarify some of the spectroscopic properties of these two types .",
    "b02 compared photospheric ",
    "phase spectra of 11 sne  ib ( mostly from m01 ) with synthetic spectra generated with the parameterized supernova synthetic - spectrum code synow .",
    "they found a tight relation between the velocity at the photosphere , as determined by fe  ii features , and the time relative to maximum light .",
    "they also found the minimum detectable velocity of he  i lines to be usually higher than 7000 .",
    "hydrogen appeared to be generally present in sne  ib , with a minimum velocity around 12,000 .",
    "the sample of b02 was restricted to events that showed deep , obvious he  i absorptions .",
    "b02 mentioned that sn  1991d , an event that had weaker he  i lines , would be discussed in a separate paper . in this paper",
    "we present and discuss photometric and spectroscopic observations that show that this object was an over - luminous and spectroscopically peculiar sn  ib that did not conform to the behavior of the events in the b02 sample .",
    "we also present some comparisons with synow synthetic spectra that raise the issues of whether lines of ne  i are present in sn  1991d , and whether in some sne  ib of the b02 sample the strongest optical line of ne  i , @xmath4 , may be an alternative to an h@xmath5 identification . in sect .",
    "[ res ] light curve models to v data and a qualitative progenitor scenario able to explain the main characteristics of sn  1991d are discussed .",
    "sn  1991d was discovered by remillard et al . on ccd images obtained on feb .  6 and 7 ut on a faint spiral arm of pgc  84044 , a seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "kirshner and filippenko & shields classified the event as type  ib / c and ib , respectively , on the basis of spectra taken on feb .",
    "10 - 11 and feb . 23 .",
    "kirshner also noted that given the magnitudes reported by remillard , sn 1991d could be as luminous as a type - ia supernova ( see sect .",

    "ccd photometric and spectroscopic observations were obtained at la silla on 10 different nights using five different telescopes .",
    "data reduction followed the standard procedures making use of a psf fitting technique for the sn photometric measurements .",
    "the measured magnitudes of sn  1991d and the estimated internal errors ( in brackets ) are reported in tab .",
    "[ obs_tab ] .",
    "the internal consistency of the sn magnitudes in different nights has been checked mostly using star a of fig .",

    "+    the b , v and r light curves of sn  1991d are shown in fig .",
    "[ phot_fig ] .",
    "the light curves are very fast and show that the sn was discovered near maximum .",
    "the post - maximum ( up to + 30d ) decline rates are @xmath10mag ( 100d)@xmath11 , @xmath12mag ( 100d)@xmath11 and @xmath13mag ( 100d)@xmath11 , very similar to the well observed type  ic sn  1994i ( 14.4 , 12.0 and @xmath14mag ( 100d)@xmath11 for the b , v and r bands respectively ; see also fig.[abs ] ) .",
    "the decline rates computed on the radioactive tails using the few points available after phase + 50d are : @xmath15 mag  ( 100d)@xmath11 and @xmath16 mag  ( 100d)@xmath11 . during this phase ,",
    "the optical light curves are powered by the thermalization of @xmath17-rays and positrons from the radioactive decay of @xmath1co into @xmath1fe . since in sn",
    "1991d the decline rates are steeper than the @xmath1co decay rate ( 0.98 mag  ( 100d)@xmath11 ) , the @xmath17-rays increasingly escaped from the ejecta without being thermalized , consistent with a low  mass of the ejecta .            because emission from shock break - out is not included in our model , to bracket possible uncertainties in the parameter estimate , we calculated semi - analytic models of sn 1991d including ( case a ) , and neglecting ( case b ) , the first two uncertain photometric points in the fit .",
    "the results of the fit of the light curve and line velocity profile of sn 1991d are displayed in table [ th_tab ] and figure [ fit ] .",
    "the main difference between the two cases is the value of the initial radius .",
    "fitting the light curve in case a requires a progenitor with an extremely large initial radius ( @xmath21 cm ) .",
    "yet , in this case the total explosion energy ( @xmath22 erg ) is about one half that required in case b , essentially because of the lower envelope mass .    in both cases , to account for the high luminosity in the tail , the explosion that originated the supernova must have been capable of producing a large amount of radioactive @xmath1ni ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is about 510 times larger than the typical yield of a type ib / c supernova @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the rapid evolution of the early light curve and the relatively low expansion velocity demand that the ejected envelope mass be small ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this fact lends support to the possibility that the progenitor of sn  1991d was a star in a close binary system ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1994 ) , rather than an isolated very massive star stripped of the envelope .",
    "we suggest a rather speculative scenario which may explain the main properties of sn  1991d : a binary system consisting of a white dwarf and a low mass helium companion ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "systems of this type have been proposed in other contexts to explain the origin and properties of the emission of cataclysmic variables , supersoft x - rays sources , and some supernovae ( tutukov & yungelson 1996 , iben and tutukov 1994 ) .",
    "concerning supernovae , two possibilities have been considered : either the wd accretes matter from the companion and exceeds the chandrasekar mass exploding as a type ia sn ( hachisu et al .",
    "1999 ) ; or the c+o core of the helium star collapses to produce a sn  ib , if a substantial fraction of the he envelope is left , or a sn ic , if it is lost ( nomoto et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "what if the wd ignites while it is hidden inside a he envelope , that is during a common envelope phase ( tutukov & yungelson 1996 ) , or while it is spiraling into the giant companion ( cf . sparks & stecher 1974 ) ?",
    "qualitatively , we would expect that because of the large radius of the helium envelope , the sn would exhibit a high peak luminosity . yet , since the envelope mass is small , the luminosity decline would be very fast . though camouflaged , this is essentially a type ia sn and therefore the mass of radioactive @xmath1ni is expected to be large and the radioactive tail quite luminous . again , because of the low ejected mass , gamma - rays from radioactive decays would not be completely trapped and the late decline of the light curve would also be fast . in this respect , we emphasize that the m@xmath26 light curve of sn  1991d is intriguingly similar to that of sn  1994d both in shape and luminosity , except for the first two brighter points ( see fig .",
    "[ fit ] ) . in these assumptions",
    ", the early spectrum is expected to show strong he lines but , because in the composition structure of a helium star the second most abundant element after he is ne ( cf .",
    "habets , 1986 ) , the presence of ne lines in the spectra would not be surprising .",
    "even the narrow  lines observed in the late spectra may be the fingerprint of the h envelope lost during the first non - conservative mass transfer / loss episode .",
    "eventually , when the sn enters the nebular phase , strong [ feii ] and [ feiii ] lines should emerge in the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the last spectrum of sn 1991d has been obtained only 78 days after maximum and is not decisive in this respect .",
    "however we note that spectra of this type have already been observed in some type ib / c supernovae .",
    "in fact , sn  1993r and sn  1990aj , two supernovae discovered in the nebular phase , showed peculiar type ib / c spectra with very intense iron lines similar to those seen in the nebular phase of snia @xcite .      clearly , to confirm",
    "if the proposed scenario is really viable , detailed numerical radiation - hydrodynamic calculations should be performed , and detailed non  local ",
    "equilibrium spectral calculations , including nonthermal ionization ( e.g. , baron et  al .",
    "2000 ) , should be carried out .",
    "in particular , these calculations will show whether ne i can produce lines of the appropriate strength . from the observational point of view , in the fortunate circumstance that a similar object will be discovered in the future , an effort should be made to secure spectra in the nebular phase .",
    "the very existence of peculiar sne like sn  1991d naturally leads to other issues .",
    "bright sne of this type might contaminate the sample of high - z objects used for the determination of the geometry of the universe .",
    "although , as speculated above , they might originate from thermonuclear explosions and share some photometric properties typical of snia , on the other side they would lead to misinterpretation of the observed data .",
    "in the recent past another bright atypical sn , the peculiar type ic sn  1992ar , has been pointed out as a possible contaminator of the snia high - z sample @xcite .",
    "although the rate of such events in the local universe seems relatively small , their frequency at high - z remains to be determined .",
