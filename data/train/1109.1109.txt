    "trojans of jupiter , which reside in the neighbourhood of @xmath2 and @xmath3 lagrangian points , serve as an important test of the planetary migration theory ( morbidelli et al .",
    "their inclination distribution , namely the large spread of  @xmath4 , can be explained as a result of chaotic capture during a brief period when jupiter and saturn encountered a 1:2 mean - motion resonance .",
    "moreover , the late heavy bombardment provides the timing of this resonant encounter @xmath5gyr ago ( gomes et al .",
    "it is thus important to understand the population of trojans accurately .",
    "there are several unresolved problems regarding trojans , however , for example the number of families , which is a stringent constraint for collisional models .",
    "roig et al .",
    "( 2008 ) studied as many as ten suggested families , using relatively sparse sloan data and spectra .",
    "they noted most families seem to be heterogeneous from the spectroscopic point of view , with one exception  the c - type eurybates family . as we argue in this paper , the number of families ( with parent - body size @xmath6 ) is indeed as low as one .",
    "another strange fact is the ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath3 trojans .",
    "szab et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used sloan colour data to reach fainter than orbital catalogues and estimated the ratio to @xmath7 .",
    "there is no clear explanation for this , since the chaotic capture as a gravitational interaction should be independent of size or @xmath8 membership .",
    "any hypothesis involving collisions would require a relatively recent disruption of a huge parent body , which is highly unlikely ( obrien and morbidelli 2008 , d.  obrien , personal communication ) .",
    "this is again related to the actual observed number of trojan families .",
    "bro and vokrouhlick ( 2008 ) studied another resonant population , the so called hilda group in the 3/2 mean - motion resonance with jupiter , and reported only two families : hilda and schubart with approximately 200 and 100 km parent bodies .",
    "this number might be in accord with low collisional probabilities , assuming the hilda family is very old and experienced the late heavy bombardment ( bro et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "levison et al . ( 2009 ) compared the observed distribution of d - type asteroids and the model of their delivery from transneptunian region .",
    "they found a good match assuming the d - types ( presumably of cometary origin ) are easy - to - disrupt objects ( with the strength more than 5 times lower than that of solid ice ) .",
    "note that trojan asteroids are a mixture of c- and d - type objects and we have to discriminate between them with respect to collisional behaviour .",
    "all of the works mentioned above are a good motivation for us to focus on asteroid families in the trojan population .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first , we describe our data sources and methods in section  [ sec : methods ]",
    ". a detailed study of orbital and physical properties of families ( and other ` false ' groupings ) is a matter of section  [ sec : families ] .",
    "section  [ sec : evolution ] is devoted to the modelling of long - term dynamical evolution .",
    "finally , there are concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use the symplectic swift integrator ( levison & duncan 1994 ) for orbital calculations .",
    "our modifications include a second order scheme of laskar & robutel ( 2001 ) and on - line digital filters , which enable us to compute suitable resonant proper elements : libration amplitude  @xmath9 of the @xmath10 oscillations , where @xmath11 is the osculating semimajor axis of an asteroid and @xmath12 that of jupiter , eccentricity @xmath13 and inclination @xmath14 .",
    "( in figures , we usually plot a mean value @xmath15 of semimajor axis plus the libration amplitude  @xmath9 . )",
    "we employ their definition from milani ( 1993 ) .",
    "the source of initial osculating elements is the astorb catalogue , version @xmath16 ( oct 31st 2010 ) .",
    "there are actually two independent filters running in parallel : in the first one , we sample osculating elements every 1yr , compute mean elements using the filter sequence b , b with decimation factors 3 , 3 ( refer to quinn , tremaine & duncan 1991 ) a store this data in a buffer spanning 1kyr .",
    "we then estimate the libration frequency  @xmath17 by a linear fit of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the mean longitudes of an asteroid and jupiter and @xmath21 for @xmath2 or @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the revolution of angle @xmath22 must not be confined to the interval @xmath23 , of course .",
    "the amplitude of  @xmath9 is computed for the already known  @xmath17 by a  discrete fourier transform .",
    "finally , an off - line running - average filter with a window 1myr is used to smooth the data . of mean longitudes",
    "anyway , there is a linear relation between @xmath9 and @xmath25 . ]    in the second filter , we compute proper eccentricity  @xmath13 and proper inclination  @xmath14 by sampling osculating elements ( 1yr step ) , computing mean elements using a filter sequence a , a , b and decimation factors 10 , 10 , 3 , and then we apply a frequency modified fourier transform ( nesvorn & idlichovsk 1997 ) , which gives us the relevant proper amplitudes .",
    "the values of the resonant elements agree very well with those listed in the astdys catalogue by kneevi & milani ( see figure  [ trojans - hcm_20100915_follow.proper.out_dfd_0myr_astdys4_e ] ) .",
    "there are only few outliers , probably due to a different time span of integration .",
    "we computed proper elements for 2647 @xmath2 and 1496 @xmath3 trojan asteroids .",
    "this sample is roughly twice larger than previously analysed .",
    "the ratio of populations valid for @xmath26 asteroids is thus @xmath27 .    the overall distribution of trojans in the @xmath28 space is shown in figure  [ trojans_l4_arer_sizes ]",
    "note there is only one cluster visible immediately in the bottom - left panel  around ( 3548 )  eurybates .",
    "the reason is its tight confinement in inclinations ( @xmath29 ) .     to aid a comparison.,width=226 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ 9799_tab ]    let us compare trojan clusters to the well known asteroid families in the outer main belt ( figure  [ main_belt_families_nv_all ] ) .",
    "most families ( e.g. , themis , koronis , eos ) exhibit a steady increase of  @xmath1 until they merge with another families or the entire outer main belt .",
    "eurybates , aneas and 1988  rg@xmath30 are the only trojan clusters which behave in a similar fashion . the veritas family ( dynamically young , nesvorn et al",
    ". 2003 ) exhibits a different behaviour  for a large interval of @xmath31 the number of members  @xmath1 remains almost the same , which indicates a clear separation from the background population . with respect to the @xmath32 dependence ,",
    "the ennomos cluster is similar to veritas .",
    "dependence for seven outer main - belt families .",

    "it is a reasonable assumption if the family is of collisional origin .",
    "we can then calculate sizes from absolute magnitudes and construct size - frequency distributions .",
    "figure  [ l4_size_distribution ] shows a comparison of sfd s for the clusters detected by the hcm is flat .",
    "size - frequency distribution is not very sensitive to this selection anyway . ] and for the whole population of @xmath2 and @xmath3 trojans .",
    "a slope  @xmath34 of the cumulative distribution @xmath35 is an indicative parameter . for @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "trojans it equals to @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the intermediate size range 15 to 60 km .",
    "( these numbers are compatible with the study of yoshida & nakamura 2008 . )",
    "the slope is steeper at large sizes .",
    "the uncertainties are mainly due to a freedom in selection of the size range and the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 sfd s does not seem significant .",
    "the clusters have typically similar slope as background ( within 0.1 uncertainty ) , thought sometimes the results are inconclusive due to small number of members .",
    "the eurybates family with @xmath38 slope is on the other hand significantly steeper than the mean slope of the whole trojan population .",
    "] there are two more groups which exhibit a relatively steep slope , namely laertes in @xmath2 ( @xmath39 ) and 1988  rg@xmath30 in @xmath3 ( @xmath40 )",
    ".    we should be aware , however , that even the background exhibits a trend with respect to inclinations ( see figure  [ trojans - hcm_20090623_trojans_sini.lsm_all ] ) .",
    "slope  @xmath34 typically decreases with inclination  @xmath14 , which is especially prominent in case of the @xmath2  cloud .",
    "we have to admit if we compare the eurybates family to its surroundings only ( @xmath41 ) , the difference in slopes is not so prominent",
    ". an interesting feature of the @xmath3  cloud is a dip in the interval @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to the approximate location of the 1988  rg@xmath30 group .",
    "the @xmath43 dependence among trojans is not unique .",
    "e.g. low - inclination bodies in the j3/2 resonance also have the sfd steeper than background ( @xmath44 versus @xmath45 ) , without any clear family and a few big interlopers",
    ". may be , this feature reflects different _ source reservoirs _ of low- and high - inclination bodies among trojans and j3/2 ?",
    "it may be also in concert with a colour  inclination dependence reported by szab et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "we also test albedo distributions dependent on size , since the measurements by fernndez et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested small trojans are significantly brighter and thus smaller .",
    "large asteroids have @xmath46 while small @xmath47 .",
    "this is a significant change of the sfd , which occurs around the size @xmath48 .",
    "the sfd thus becomes shallower below this size , e.g. for eurybates we would have @xmath49 and for l4 trojans @xmath50 , so the sfd s become comparable with respect to the slope . thought , as we stated above , for a real collisional family we expect the albedo distribution to be rather homogeneous and independent of size .            of the size - frequency distributions @xmath51 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 trojans and their dependence on the inclination  @xmath14 .",

    "2008 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ pc1_vs_pc2_err_eurybates ] .",
    "it is clearly visible that the distribution of the eurybates family in the space of @xmath61 colours is different from the trojan background . on contrary ,",
    "the 1988 rg@xmath30 group covers essentially the same area as the background .",
    "the aneas is only slightly shifted towards larger @xmath58 and @xmath59 with respect to the background .",
    "there is a lack of data for the ennomos group  three bodies are not sufficient to compare the colour distributions .",
    "alternatively , we may use principal component analysis of the sdss colour indices .",
    "we use only data with uncertainties smaller than 0.2mag , which resulted in 70887 records .",
    "we calculated eigenvalues ( @xmath62 , 0.0532 , 0.0249 , 0.0095 ) , corresponding eigenvectors and constructed the following three principal components ( trojanov 2010 ) : @xmath63 which have a clear physical interpretation : pc@xmath64 corresponds to an overall slope , pc@xmath65 is a variability in the @xmath57  band , and pc@xmath66 a depth of the @xmath67 absorption band .",
    "the eurybates family is different from trojans in all three principal components ( mean pc@xmath64 of the eurybates members is smaller , pc@xmath65 and pc@xmath66 larger ) .",
    "the aneas group has the same distribution of pc@xmath65 and pc@xmath66 as trojans and the 1988  rg@xmath30 group is similar to trojans even in all three components .",
    "hence , we confirm the eurybates family seems distinct in color even in the fourth version of the sdss - moc .",
    "this fact is consistent with previous work of roig et al .",

    "the distribution of velocities `` at infinity '' follows the function @xmath71 with the exponent @xmath72 being a  free parameter , @xmath73 a normalisation constant and @xmath74 the escape velocity from the parent body , which is determined by its size  @xmath75 and mean density  @xmath76 .",
    "the distribution is cut at a selected maximum allowed velocity @xmath77 to prevent outliers .",
    "we typically use @xmath78 .",
    "the orientations of velocity vectors in space are assigned randomly .",
    "we assume the velocity of fragments is independent on their size .",
    "there are several more free parameters , which determine the initial shape of the family in the space of proper elements : initial osculating eccentricity  @xmath79 of the parent body , initial inclination  @xmath80 , as well as true anomaly  @xmath81 and argument of perihelion  @xmath82 at the time of impact disruption .",
    "an example of a synthetic family just after disruption and its comparison to the observed eurybates family is shown in figure  [ eurybates - impact4_f0_ae ] .",
    "usually , there is a significant disagreement between this simple model of impact disruption and the observations .",
    "synthetic families usually look like thin ` filaments ' in the @xmath28 space , which are curved due to the mapping from osculating elements to resonant ones . on the other hand ,",
    "observed groups among trojans are much more spread .",
    "however , this only indicates an importance of further long - term evolution by chaotic diffusion and possibly by planetary migration .    in case of the ennomos group members ,",
    "they are distributed mostly on larger semimajor axes than ( 4709 ) ennomos , thought isotropic impact disruptions produce fragments distributed evenly on larger and smaller  @xmath11 .",
    "may be , it is an indication of an anisotropic velocity field ? or a different parent body of this cluster ?",
    "if asteroid families are very old , planetary migration might influence their current shape . in order to study of late stages of planetary migration , which is caused by interactions with a planetesimal disk ,",
    "we construct the following model .",
    "we treat the migration analytically within a modified version of the numerical symplectic swift - rmvs3 integrator ( levison & duncan 1994 ) , which accounts for gravitational perturbations of the sun and four giant planets and includes also an energy - dissipation term , as described in bro et al . (",
    "the speed of migration is characterised by the exponential time scale @xmath83 and the required total change of semimajor axis @xmath84 .",
    "we use an eccentricity damping formula too , which simulates the effects of dynamical friction and prevent an unrealistic increase of eccentricities ( morbidelli et al .",
    "the amount of damping is determined by the parameter @xmath85 .",
    "we try to adjust initial orbital parameters of planets and the parameters of migration in such a way to end up at currently observed orbits .",
    "the integration time step is @xmath86  days and the time span is usually equal to @xmath87 , when planetary orbits almost stop to migrate .      on long time scales ,",
    "the yarkovsky thermal force might cause significant perturbations of orbits .",
    "we use an implementation of the yarkovsky thermal effect in the swift n - body integrator ( bro 2006 ) .",
    "it includes both the diurnal and seasonal variants .",
    "the yorp effect ( thermal torques affecting spin states ; vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2006 ) was not taken into account in our simulations .",
    "the reason is that the respective time scale  @xmath88 is of the order 100my to 1gyr so as a ` zero ' approximation , we neglect the yorp effect on these `` short '' time scales and keep the orientations of the spin axes fixed .    for trojan asteroids captured in a zero - order mean motion resonance ,",
    "the yarkovsky perturbation only affects the position of libration centre ( moldovan et al .",
    "note that the perturbation acts ` instantly '  there is no systematic secular drift in eccentricity nor in other proper elements which is an important difference from first - order resonances , where a @xmath13-drift is expected ( bro & vokrouhlick 2008 , appendix  a ) .",
    "this is another reason we do not need a detailed yorp model here .",
    "the thermal parameter we use are reasonable estimates for c / x - type bodies : @xmath89 for the surface and bulk densities , @xmath90 for the surface thermal conductivity , @xmath91 for the heat capacity , @xmath92 for the bond albedo and @xmath93 for the thermal emissivity .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss properties of selected clusters : eurybates , ennomos , aneas and 1988  rg@xmath30 .",
    "we focus on these four clusters , since they seem most prominent according to our previous analysis .",
    "the eurybates family can be detected by the hierarchical clustering method for cut  off velocities @xmath94 , when it merges with menelaus ( see figure  [ l4_nv_random ] ) . yet",
    ", we do not rely just on the hcm !",
    "another selection criterion we use is a ` meaningful ' shape of the family and its changes with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "a very important characteristic of the eurybates family at low values of @xmath31 is a tight confinement of inclinations ( @xmath14 within 0.01 ) .",
    "it breaks down at @xmath95 , so we consider this value as an upper limit . the eurybates family is also confined in semimajor axis , being approximately twice smaller than other groups .",
    "the diameter of the parent body is @xmath96 for albedo @xmath97 if we sum the volumes of the known bodies . of course ,",
    "in reality it is slightly larger due to observational incompleteness .",
    "if we prolong the slope of the sfd @xmath98 down to zero we obtain @xmath99 .",
    "the geometric method of tanga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) gives an upper limit @xmath100 .",
    "spectral slopes of family members are rather homogeneous and correspond to c / p - types ( roig et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the cluster around ( 4709 ) ennomos can be recognised for a wide interval of cut  off velocities @xmath101 when it stays compact and confined in inclinations @xmath102 . very probably , there are several interlopers , because we can count 4 to 10 asteroids in the surroundings , i.e. , in the same volume of the @xmath28 space ( see figure  [ trojans_l5_arer_sizes_ennomos ] ) . since small bodies dominate the ennomos group we suspect large bodies might be actually interlopers .",
    "a very intriguing feature is a high albedo of ( 4709 ) ennomos @xmath0 measured by fernndez et al .",
    "apart from other explanations , the authors speculated it may result from a recent impact which covered the surface with pristine ice .",
    "if true the relation between the fresh surface and the collisional family might be a unique opportunity to study cratering events .",
    "we can not exclude a possibility that ( 4709 ) ennomos is actually an interloper and the family is not related to it at all .",
    "nevertheless , our hypothesis is testable : family members should exhibit a similarity in spectra and albedos .",
    "the only information we have to date are sdss colours for three members : 98362 , 2005  yg@xmath103 are probably c - types and 2005  ar@xmath104 is a d - type . in case",
    "new data become available we can remove interlopers from our sample and improve our analysis .",
    "the size distribution of the ennomos group is barely constrained , since small bodies are at the observational limit .",
    "moreover , removal of interlopers can change the sfd slope completely ( from @xmath105 to @xmath106 or so ) .",
    "the minimum parent body size is about @xmath107 if all members have high albedo @xmath108 .",
    "the aneas group looks like a middle portion of the @xmath3 cloud with approximately background density .",
    "it spans whole range of semimajor axes , as background asteroids do .",
    "the minimum size of a hypothetical parent body is @xmath109 ( for albedo @xmath110 ) .",
    "this size is very large and an impact disruption of such body is less probable ( see section  [ sec : collisions ] ) .",
    "the size - frequency distribution is shallow , with approximately the same slope as background .    according to roig et al .",
    "( 2008 ) the colours are rather homogeneous and correspond to d - types , with @xmath111 of probable interlopers .",
    "the group around asteroid ( 11487 ) 1988 rg@xmath30 again looks like a lower portion of the @xmath3  cloud at low inclinations , with @xmath112 .",
    "the sfd is steeper ( @xmath113 ) than surroundings in @xmath3 and the resulting parent body size @xmath114 is relatively small .",
    "the colours seems heterogeneous ( roig et al .",
    "2008 ) and we can confirm this statement based on the new sdss - moc version  4 data .",
    "the remaining clusters ( hektor , teucer , sinon , 1986  wd , laertes , asios , polydoros , panthoos , etc . )",
    "may be characterised as follows : ( i )  they have a density in @xmath28 space comparable to that of background ( surroundings ) ; ( ii )  when identified by the hcm their semimajor axes span the whole range of trojan region ; ( iii )  the slopes of their sfd s are comparable to the background ; ( iv )  they are often inhomogeneous with respect to colours ( according to roig et al .",
    "these reasons lead us to a conclusion that these clusters are not necessarily real collisional families .",
    "we try to model long - term evolution of the eurybates family . at first",
    ", we generate a synthetic family ( consisting of 42 bodies ) by an impact disruption of the parent body with required size .",
    "then we integrate the synthetic family and compare it at particular time to the observed eurybates family .",
    "the time span of the integration is 4gyr .",
    "the main driving mechanism is slow _",
    "chaotic diffusion _ ( the yarkovsky effect is present but inefficient in the trojan region ) .",
    "initially , the spread of inclinations of the synthetic family is consistent with the observed one . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape in @xmath115 elements is clearly inconsistent .",
    "since the inclinations evolve only barely we focus on the evolution of in the @xmath115 plane ( see figure  [ eurybates - impye2_ae_500myr ] ) .",
    "the point is the synthetic family , namely the ` filament ' structure , has to disperse sufficiently .",
    "after 500myr it is still recognisable but after 1gyr of evolution it is not .",
    "so we may constrain the age of the eurybates family from 1  to 4gyr .",
    "distributions : initially the ks distance is @xmath116 and the probability @xmath117 , which means the distribution are incompatible . at @xmath118 ,",
    "the values are @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which indicates a reasonable match . ]",
    "a similar analysis for the ennomos group indicates that chaotic diffusion is faster in this region ( given the large inclination ) and the most probable age thus seems to be from 1 to 2gyr . beyond 2gyr",
    "the inclinations of the synthetic family become too large compared to the observed ennomos group , while the eccentricites are still compatible .",
    "we try to model aneas and 1988 rg@xmath30 groups too ( see figure  [ aneas - impye2_ae_4gyr ] ) . in these two cases",
    ", there is a strong disagreement between our model and observations .",
    "the observed groups are much larger and chaotic diffusion in respective regions is very slow .",
    "even after 4gyr of orbital evolution , the synthetic family remains too small .",
    "the only free parameter which may substantially change our results is the initial velocity distribution . theoretically , the distribution might have been strongly anisotropic",
    ". however , we can not choose initial velocities entirely freely , since their magnitude should be comparable to the escape velocity from the parent body , which is fixed by the size @xmath121 and only weakly dependent on a - priori unknown density @xmath76 .",
    "another solution of this problem is possible if we assume families are very old and they experienced perturbations due to planetary migration .                  the major perturbation acting on trojans are _ secondary resonances _ between the libration period  @xmath122 of the asteroid in the j1/1 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and the period @xmath123 of the critical argument of jupiter ",

    "( the so called great inequality period ) thought it is weaker than @xmath123 .",
    "we find no asteroids perturbed by secondary resonances connected with @xmath127 or @xmath128 which are present ` en route ' .",
    "neither uranus nor neptune play an important role . ]",
    "all synthetic families are strongly unstable when @xmath129 and even during later stages of migration with @xmath130 the eccentricities of family members are perturbed too much to match the observed families like eurybates or ennomos ( see figure  [ eurybates - mig3_dampe_ae_at_00000300 ] ) .",
    "there are practically no plausible migration scenarios  regardless of time scale @xmath83  which would produce a sufficiently compact group , unless jupiter and saturn are almost on their current orbits .",
    "we tested @xmath131 and even for @xmath132 as small as @xmath133 and @xmath134 the perturbation was too strong .",
    "the reason is that one has to avoid @xmath135 secondary resonance to preserve a low spread of a synthetic family .",
    "let us conclude if any of trojan families was created during planetary migration and if the migration was smooth ( exponential ) the family can not be visible today .",
    "however , we can not exclude a possibility that final stages of migration were entirely different , e.g. , similar to the ` jumping - jupiter ' scenario ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2010 ) .     in this case ) .",
    "top panel : the state at 0myr , middle : 100myr , bottom : the respective orbital evolution of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the family is almost destroyed and it is definitely incompatible with the observed eurybates family.,width=313 ]      we studied a possibility that some families can not be identified because the breakup occurred at the outskirts of the stable libration zone and some fragments were ejected outside the j1/1 resonance .",
    "we thus chose 30  largest asteroids near the edge of the @xmath2  libration zone and we simulated breakups of these asteroids which create families with 30 fragments each .",
    "we assumed the diameter of all parent bodies equal to @xmath136 and their density @xmath137 .",
    "the breakups always occurred at the same geometry @xmath138 , @xmath139 . after the breakup , we calculated proper elements of the family members and plotted their distribution ( see figure  [ ballistic_transport_ei ] ) .",
    "we can see all 30 synthetic families can be easily identified . in most cases ,",
    "more than 95% of family members remained within the stable libration zone .",
    "we can thus conclude that the ejection of fragments outside the libration zone does not affect the number of observed families among trojans .",
    "we can estimate collisional activity by means of a simple stationary model .",
    "trojan collisions play a major role here , because trojans are detached from the main belt . in case of eurybates , the target ( parent body ) diameter @xmath140 , the mean impact velocity @xmath141 ( delloro et al . 1998 )",
    ", the strength @xmath142 ( benz & asphaug 1999 ) and thus the necessary impactor size ( bottke et al . 2005 ) @xmath143 number of @xmath144 projectiles among @xmath2 trojans is @xmath145 and we have @xmath146 available targets .",
    "an intrinsic collision probability for trojan  trojan collisions @xmath147 ( delloro et al .",
    "1998 ) and corresponding frequency of disruptions is @xmath148 over the age of the solar system @xmath149 ( after the lhb ) , we have a very low number of such events @xmath150 .",
    "this number seems to be in concert with only one @xmath151 family currently observed among trojans . while the number of observed families with @xmath152 is about  20 ( durda et al .",
    "these two numbers are comparable at least to order - of - magnitude . ] in a less - likely case , the material of the eurybates parent body was very weak and its strength may be at most one order of magnitude lower , @xmath153 ( see leinhardt & stewart 2009 , bottke et al .",
    "we then obtain @xmath154 and @xmath155 , so the conclusion about the low number of expected trojan families remains essentially the same .",
    "the parent body of aneas group is 1.5 larger and consequently the resulting number of events is more than one order of magnitude lower . on the other hand , clusters with smaller parent bodies ( @xmath156 ) or significantly weaker ( @xmath157 )",
    "might be more frequent .    during the late heavy bombardment epoch",
    "we may assume a substantial increase of collisional activity ( levison et al .",
    "hypothetical old families were however probably ` erased ' due to the late phases of planetary migration ( see section  [ sec : migration ] ) unless the migration time scale for jupiter and saturn was significantly shorter than the time scale of the impactor flux from transneptunian region which is mainly controlled by the migration of uranus and neptune .",
    "increasing number of trojan asteroids with available proper elements enables us to get new insights into this important population . essentially , new faint / small asteroids filled the ` gaps ' in the proper - element space between previously known clusters and today it seems most clusters are rather comparable to background .",
    "one should be aware that the number of families among trojans may be low and one should not take the number of @xmath158 families as a rule .    only the c - type eurybates family fulfils all criteria to be considered a collisional family .",
    "this is probably also true for the newly discovered ennomos group .",
    "moreover , there might be a potentially interesting relation between the high - albedo surface of ( 4709 ) ennomos and the collisional family thought we do not have enough data yet to prove it independently ( by colours , spectra or albedos ) .",
    "note there may exist clusters among trojans which are not of collisional origin .",
    "they may be caused by : ( i )  differences in chaotic diffusion rates ; ( ii )  @xmath159-dependent efficiency of original capture mechanism ; or ( iii )  it may somehow reflect orbital distribution in source regions .",
    "we can not exclude a hypothetical existence of old families which were totally dispersed by dynamical processes , e.g. , by perturbations due to planetary migration which is especially efficient in the trojan region .",
    "finally , note there seem to be no d - type families anywhere in the solar system  neither in the trojan region , nor in the j3/2 ( bro et al .",
    "2011 ) and cybele regions ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2010 ) . may be , the d - type parent bodies are too weak and the target is completely pulverized during a collision ?",
    "this might have important implications for collisional models of icy bodies .",
