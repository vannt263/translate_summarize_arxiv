    "note that if there is an edge from @xmath3 to @xmath15 and an edge from @xmath15 to @xmath3 then we have two unknowns @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the negative of the _ laplacian _ of the digraph @xmath4 .",

    "<S> toric dynamical systems are known as complex balancing mass action systems in the mathematical chemistry literature , where many of their remarkable properties have been established . </S>",
    "<S> they include as special cases all deficiency zero systems and all detailed balancing systems . </S>",
    "<S> one feature is that the steady state locus of a toric dynamical system is a toric variety , which has a unique point within each invariant polyhedron . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the basic theory of toric dynamical systems in the context of computational algebraic geometry and show that the associated moduli space is also a toric variety . </S>",
    "<S> it is conjectured that the complex balancing state is a global attractor . </S>",
    "<S> we prove this for detailed balancing systems whose invariant polyhedron is two - dimensional and bounded .    _ this paper is dedicated to the memory of karin gatermann ( 19612005 ) . _        chemical reaction network , toric ideal , complex balancing , detailed balancing , deficiency zero , trajectory , birch s theorem , matrix - tree  theorem , moduli space , polyhedron </S>"
