    "in summary , we proposed gauged njl inflation as an alternative for higgs inflation .",
    "specifically , the gauged njl model is studied as the realistic particle physics model for the composite scalar . applying the auxiliary field method and performing the renormalization group improvement ( for review of rg in curved spacetime , see @xcite ) ,",
    "the model is represented by the gauge - higgs - yukawa theory .",
    "we assumed that the gauge - higgs - yukawa theory well describes the model at the scale of inflation at the @xmath161 limit .",
    "then the produced cmb fluctuations have been calculated in the gauge - higgs - yukawa theory with the compositeness conditions at the fixed gauge coupling .",
    "the behavior for inflationary parameters @xmath93 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 has been numerically evaluated as a function of the couplings , the renormalization scale , the e - folding number and the number of the fermion species .",
    "it is found that the smallness of the density fluctuation can be realized by tuning the gauge coupling .",
    "we proved that the model with a small number of fermion species , @xmath102 satisfies the planck 2015 data . in this case the spectral index , the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the running of the spectral index develop almost fixed values , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 for @xmath119 . for a large number of fermion species , these inflationary parameters depend on the renormalization scale @xmath29 .",
    "however , the obtained trajectories of the inflationary parameters are consistent with the planck 2015 data .",
    "therefore , the gauged njl model naturally generates inflationary parameters consistent with the planck 2015 observation and may serve as viable inflationary theory .    at the next step , one has to consider the end of inflation and graceful exit .",
    "it is clear that higher - derivative rg corrected terms ( like @xmath160 , etc ) which are induced as vacuum polarization beyond the linear - curvature approximation may naturally provide the graceful exit .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the reheating process in the gauged njl model .",
    "in fact , this goes beyond this work .",
    "however , the preliminary considerations of preheating process indicate reheating maybe successful as it is in usual scalar theories of inflation ( in fact , our model is effectively scalar inflationary theory ) .",
    "these questions will be considered elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , njl model may pretend to the role of dark matter ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , hence presumably unifying inflation with dark matter .",
    "the authors are grateful to t.  kugo for useful comments .",
    "the work by ti is supported in part by jsps kakenhi grant number 26400250 and that by sdo is supported in part by mineco ( spain ) , project fis2013 - 44881 and by mes ( russia ) .",
    "let us discuss the slow - roll solution in the njl model .",
    "it is obtained by omitting the gauge interaction .",
    "here we consider the njl limit , @xmath162 , where the gauge interaction is eliminated . at the limit the running couplings ( [ running : y ] ) and ( [ running : lambda ] ) reduce to @xmath43^{-1 }",

    "( [ running : mass ] ) and ( [ njl : y ] ) we obtain @xmath163 where we renormalize @xmath164 suitably to obtain a finite expression @xcite .",
    "following the similar procedure in sec .",

    "it suppresses the effective potential for a large @xmath18 . the effective potential ( [ ve : njl ] ) has a maximum at @xmath172 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : potentialnjl ] the typical behavior of the effective potential ( [ ve : njl ] ) is shown .",
    "it is observed that the horizon crossing @xmath89 should take place near the maximum of the potential to obtain large enough e - folding @xmath173 .",
    "the e - folding is plotted as a function of @xmath149 in fig .",
    "[ fig : efnjl ] .",
    "it blows up at @xmath172 .",
    "we noted that the @xmath101 dependence gives only a negligible contribution to the e - folding .",
    "the result introduces a fine- tuning problem why @xmath174 . to avoid this fine - tuning problem",
    "one should modify the potential .",
    "since the potential can be easily modified by including terms which are neglected in our approximation , the fine - tuning problem seems to be not so serious .",
