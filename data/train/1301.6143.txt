    "let @xmath4 be a real or complex separable banach space of infinite dimension , and @xmath5 a bounded linear operator  on @xmath4 .",
    "an important question in operator  theory is to determine whether or not @xmath6 always admits a non trivial invariant closed subspace , i.e. if there exists a closed subspace @xmath7 of @xmath4 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "this problem is called the _ invariant subspace problem _ , and it has been answered in the negative in the @xmath11 s by enflo @xcite and read @xcite : they constructed some separable spaces @xmath4 along with some operators  @xmath6 on @xmath4 having no non - trivial invariant closed subspaces .",
    "then read @xcite , @xcite gave examples of such operators  on some classical banach spaces such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "all these operators  live on non - reflexive banach spaces .",
    "the invariant subspace problem remains open for reflexive banach spaces , and in particular for the hilbert spaces .",
    "the best counterexample in this direction is due to read @xcite : he constructed an operator  without non - trivial  invariant closed subspace on @xmath12 , the @xmath13-sum of countably many copies of the james space @xmath14 . since @xmath14 has codimension @xmath15 in its bidual , the space @xmath16 is separable .    the _ invariant subset problem _ , which is to know whether a bounded operator   @xmath6 on @xmath4 always admits a closed subset @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , is even more widely open than the invariant subspace problem .",
    "the only known counterexamples to this problem are due to read , who constructed in @xcite operators  on @xmath0 ( and more generally on any space containing a complemented copy of @xmath21 ) with no non - trivial  invariant  closed subset .",
    "the invariant subspace and subset problems can be reformulated in terms of cyclic   and hypercyclic  vectors : recall that if @xmath22 is any vector of @xmath4 , the _ orbit of @xmath22 under the action of @xmath6 _ is the set @xmath23 .",
    "its closure @xmath24 is the smallest closed subset of @xmath4 which is invariant by @xmath6 and contains @xmath22 , while the closure of the linear span of the orbit of @xmath22 is the smallest closed subspace of @xmath4 which is invariant  by @xmath6 and contains @xmath22 .",
    "the vector @xmath22 is said to be _ cyclic _ for @xmath6 is the linear span of the orbit of @xmath22 is dense in @xmath4 , and _",
    "hypercyclic _ if the orbit itself is dense in @xmath4 .",
    "hence @xmath6 has no non - trivial  invariant  closed subspace if and only if every non - zero vector is cyclic for @xmath6 , and no non - trivial  invariant  closed subset if and only if every non - zero vector is hypercyclic  for @xmath6 .",
    "we will be concerned in this paper with read s type operators : by this we mean operators  of the kind constructed by read in his various works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite on invariant subspaces and subsets issues .",
    "they are of a very combinatorial nature , and although the constructions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite rely on a basis of common techniques , each of them has to be adapted to the particular space one is working with .",
    "for instance , the constructions of @xcite and @xcite rely heavily on the additive properties of the @xmath0 norm , while those of @xcite depend on some particular features of the canonical basis of the spaces involved , namely @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "our first aim in this paper is to present a unified approach to all these constructions , and to show how all the known counterexamples to the invariant subspace or subset problem on `` concrete '' banach spaces can be derived from a single general statement .",
    "we are especially interested in determining which geometric properties of a banach space will ensure that it supports an operator  without non - trivial invariant  closed subset .",
    "this is of interest in the view of the recent works of argyros and haydon @xcite and argyros and motakis @xcite : in @xcite , examples are constructed of spaces on which every operator  is of the form @xmath25 , with @xmath26 a scalar and @xmath27 a compact operator , and it is well - known that such operators always have a non - trivial closed invariant  subspace @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors exhibit reflexive banach spaces on which every operator   has a non - trivial invariant  closed subspace .",
    "the spaces of of @xcite and @xcite are hereditarily indecomposable , so they are certainly very far from the kind of spaces which we are going to consider in our forthcoming theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "here is our first main result , which yields a large class of non - reflexive banach spaces on which operators  without non - trivial invariant  closed subsets can be constructed .",
    "contrary to the spaces of @xcite and @xcite , which support no operator  with no non - trivial  invariant  closed subspace , the spaces to which theorem [ th1 ] applies are decomposable in a very strong sense .",
    "[ th1 ] let @xmath28 be a non - reflexive banach space admitting a schauder basis .",
    "let @xmath4 be one of the spaces @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 , where we denote by @xmath29 or @xmath31 the direct @xmath32- or @xmath1-sum of infinitely many copies of the space @xmath28 .",
    "then there exists a bounded operator  @xmath6 on @xmath4 which has no non - trivial invariant  closed subset .",
    "the same conclusion holds true for any ,  space which contains a complemented copy of one of the spaces @xmath4 above .",
    "we retrieve in particular the existence of an operator  on @xmath33 with no non - trivial invariant  closed subset @xcite , and improve the results of @xcite by showing that @xmath1 and @xmath2 support operators  without non - trivial invariant  closed subsets .",
    "an interesting consequence of theorem [ th1 ] is :    [ cor2 ] let @xmath4 be an infinite - dimensional non - reflexive  ,  space having an unconditional basis . then there exists a bounded operator  on @xmath4 with no non - trivial  invariant  closed subset .    indeed by a classical result of james @xcite",
    ", such a space @xmath4 contains a complemented subspace which is isomorphic to either @xmath34 or @xmath21 .",
    "it then suffices to apply theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "if we are only interested in operators without non - trivial  invariant  closed subspaces , the analogue of corollary [ cor2 ] follows already from this argument and the works @xcite and @xcite of read .",
    "theorem [ th1 ] and corollary [ cor2 ] impose as an assumption that the space @xmath4 one is working with be non - reflexive .",
    "as mentioned previously , all known counterexamples to the invariant subspace problem live on non - reflexive banach spaces , and the role played by reflexivity in these questions is not really clear .",
    "our second goal in this work is to shed some light on this question , and to explain at which point of a read s type construction the non - reflexivity assumption becomes really crucial .",
    "two - thirds of such a construction can be adapted to any kind of `` reasonable '' space ( for instance , to all the @xmath35 spaces ) , in particular to the hilbert space .",
    "this was shown in the paper @xcite , where operators  on the hilbert space with few invariant  closed subsets were constructed .",
    "we quote here the main result of @xcite ( combined with a remark from @xcite ) , which shows which kind of properties of read s type operators  can be enforced in the hilbertian setting .",
    "[ th0]@xcite there exists a bounded operator  on a ,  ( real or complex ) hilbert space @xmath36 which satisfies the following two properties :    @xmath37 for every @xmath38 the closure of the sets @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] coincide ;    @xmath41 the family @xmath42 of the closures of the orbits of @xmath6 is totally ordered , i.e. for any pair @xmath43 of vectors of @xmath36 , either @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "it follows from this that the set of non - hypercyclic  vectors for @xmath6 is very small in the sense that it is contained in a countable union of closed subspaces of @xmath36 which are of infinite codimension in @xmath36 .",
    "property ( p1 ) can be reformulated as `` the closure of any orbit is a subspace '' , while operators  satisfying property ( p2 ) are usually called _ orbit - unicellular_. the combination of properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) is already a strong requirement on the structure of the lattice of invariant closed subspaces of @xmath6 , and this is what forces the set of non - hypercyclic  vectors to be very small ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) for more details ) .",
    "still , properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) are no sufficient in order to guarantee that @xmath6 has no non - zero non - hypercyclic  vector , and it is proved in @xcite that the read s type operators   on the hilbert space constructed in @xcite do have non - trivial invariant  closed subsets ( which are automatically subspaces by ( p1 ) ) . in order to go one step further and gain more information on vectors which are close to the orbit of any non - zero vector , non - reflexivity of the space becomes essential .",
    "we prove the following theorem , which can be seen as a kind of `` first step '' towards the construction of operators  without non - trivial invariant  closed subsets :    [ th2 ] let @xmath4 be a separable non - reflexive  banach space having a schauder basis and containing a complemented copy of one of the spaces @xmath32 , @xmath46 , or @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the canonical basis of this space @xmath32 or @xmath1 , where we suppose without loss of generality that @xmath48 .",
    "for any @xmath49 there exists a bounded operator  @xmath6 on @xmath4 for which @xmath50 is hypercyclic and which has the following three properties :    @xmath37 for every @xmath51 the closure of the sets @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] coincide ;    @xmath41 the family @xmath52 of the closures of its orbits is totally ordered ;    @xmath53 for any non - zero  vector @xmath51 the distance of the orbit @xmath39 to @xmath50 is less than @xmath54 : @xmath55 .",
    "we have observed that an operator  @xmath5 has no non - trivial  invariant  closed subset if and only if  every non - zero vector is hypercyclic  for @xmath6 . a natural way to check",
    "this is the following : pick a given hypercyclic  vector of norm @xmath15 , in our context the vector @xmath50 . then prove that whenever @xmath49 and @xmath51 a non - zero  vector , there exists a nonnegative integer @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , i.e. that the distance of @xmath39 to @xmath50 is less than @xmath54 .",
    "property ( p3 ) gives this for a fixed @xmath49 . in order to show that any non - zero vector @xmath22 is hypercyclic  for @xmath6",
    ", we would need property ( p3 ) to hold true for a sequence @xmath58 of real numbers in @xmath59 going to zero as @xmath60 goes to infinity .",
    "this is where the assumption of theorem [ th1 ] comes into the picture : infinitely many copies of the non - reflexive space @xmath28 are needed in order to @xmath61-approximate the vector @xmath50 by an element of the orbit of any non - zero vector for arbitrary @xmath61 .",
    "but if we require this approximation for one _ single _",
    "@xmath61 , one copy of this space @xmath28 is enough .",
    "property ( p3 ) can be very close to forcing some operator  on the space to have no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace at all .",
    "when @xmath4 is a hilbert space , this is indeed the case .",
    "this is the content of our next theorem , which highlights again the role played by the geometry of the space in such considerations :    [ th3 ] let @xmath50 be a norm - one vector of the complex hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a fixed real number .",
    "suppose that there exists a bounded operator  @xmath6 on @xmath13 which has no eigenvector and satisfies the following property :    @xmath62 for any non - zero  vector @xmath51 , the distance of the closed invariant subspace @xmath63 $ ] generated by @xmath22 to the vector @xmath50 is less than @xmath54 : @xmath64 .",
    "then there exists a bounded operator  @xmath65 on @xmath13 which has no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace .    as a straightforward corollary one obtains :    [ cor3bis ] let @xmath50 be a norm - one vector of the complex hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a fixed real number .",
    "suppose that there exists a bounded operator  @xmath6 on @xmath13 which satisfies property ( p3 ) of theorem [ th2 ] above",
    ".    then there exists a bounded operator  @xmath65 on @xmath13 which has no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace .",
    "it is funny to note that one can come surprisingly close to constructing an operator  on a hilbert space which satisfies the assumption of corollary [ cor3bis ] :    [ th3bis ] let @xmath50 be a norm - one vector of the complex hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a fixed real number .",
    "there exists a bounded operator  @xmath6 on @xmath13 and a non - zero vector @xmath66 such that @xmath50 is a hypercyclic vector for @xmath6 , @xmath67 , and    @xmath68 for any vector @xmath69 not colinear to @xmath70 , the distance of the orbit @xmath39 to @xmath50 is less than @xmath54 .    in particular , the distance of @xmath50 to any closed non - trivial invariant  subspace of @xmath6 is less than @xmath61 .",
    "the operator  @xmath6 constructed in the proof of theorem [ th3bis ] is not injective : @xmath71 , and so it definitely has non - trivial invariant  subspaces .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th3bis ] shows that any non - trivial invariant closed subspace of @xmath6 necessarily contains the vector @xmath70 .",
    "there is an obvious class of non - reflexive banach spaces to which theorem [ th1 ] does not apply , although theorem [ th2 ] might : these are the quasi - reflexive spaces , i.e. the non - reflexive spaces @xmath28 such that the quotient @xmath72 is finite - dimensional .",
    "for instance the james space @xmath14 , which contains a complemented copy of @xmath13 , supports by theorem [ th2 ] operators  which satisfy ( p1 ) , ( p2 ) and ( p3 ) , but it is not known whether it supports an operator  with no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace .",
    "there seems to be a good reason for this :    [ th4 ] suppose that there exists a ,  quasi - reflexive space @xmath28 of order @xmath15 which supports an operator  with no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace .",
    "then there exists a ,  reflexive space @xmath4 which supports an operator  with no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace .",
    "this is not hard to prove , and is implied by the following more general statement ( see proposition [ propnewd ] ) : suppose that we are given a ,  banach space @xmath28 and a bounded operator  @xmath6 on @xmath28 which has no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace ( resp .",
    "subset ) , and that @xmath6 is weakly compact .",
    "then there exists a reflexive ,  banach space @xmath4 and a bounded operator  on @xmath4 which has no non - trivial invariant  closed subspace ( resp .",
    "subset ) . now every operator  on a quasi - reflexive space @xmath28 of order @xmath15 can be written as @xmath73 , where @xmath26 is a scalar and @xmath74 is a weakly compact operator  on @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ th4 ] follows from this .",
    "the closest one can get for the time being to constructing an operator  without non - trivial invariant  subspaces on a quasi - reflexive space is the following :    [ th5 ] there exists a ,  quasi - reflexive space @xmath28 of order @xmath15 whose dual @xmath75 ( which is also a ,  quasi - reflexive space of order @xmath15 ) supports an operator  @xmath6 with no non - trivial invariant  @xmath3-closed subspace .    as this operator  is again obtained via a read",
    "s type construction , it is not an adjoint .",
    "it was first proved by troitsky and schlumprecht in @xcite that the operators  constructed by read in @xcite on @xmath0 are not adjoints of an operator  on any predual of @xmath21 , and it is a general fact that no read s type operator  on a dual space @xmath4 is ever an adjoint of some operator  on a predual of @xmath4 ( see section [ sec7 ] for details ) .    the paper is organized as follows : we recall in section [ sec2 ] the general principle of read s type constructions , define the operators  which will be used in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] and present some of their general properties .",
    "theorem [ th2 ] itself is proved in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we then show how the operators  introduced previously have to be modified if we want them to satisfy the conclusion of theorem [ th1 ] , and we prove theorem [ th1 ] in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we investigate in section [ sec5 ] how far these constructions may be extended to the hilbert space setting , and prove there theorems [ th3 ] and [ th3bis ] .",
    "we consider the case of quasi - reflexive spaces in section [ sec6 ] , where theorems [ th4 ] and [ th5 ] are proved .",
    "section [ sec7 ] contains miscellaneous remarks and comments .",
    "we present first in an informal way the general philosophy of read s type constructions : they can be carried out on spaces of the form @xmath76 , @xmath30 , or @xmath77 , or more generally on any space of the form @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a space with a symmetric basis on which weighted shifts with bounded weights can safely be defined .",
    "the space @xmath28 is a ,  space , which is usually assumed to have a schauder basis .",
    "it is always possible to incorporate in the construction an arbitrary ,  banach space @xmath80 : the proofs can be extended without any trouble to spaces of the form @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "this does not present any new difficulty in this setting compared to the works @xcite or @xcite of read , so we refer the reader to one of these papers where the argument is given in detail , and restrict ourselves from now on to the case of spaces of the form @xmath83 or @xmath77 .",
    "when writing @xmath83 , we mean that the direct sum between @xmath32 and @xmath28 is an @xmath32-sum , and when writing @xmath77 that it is an @xmath84-sum .    denoting by @xmath85 the canonical basis of @xmath32 or @xmath1 , and by @xmath86 a schauder basis of @xmath28 , we construct two sequences @xmath87 and @xmath88 of vectors of @xmath4 in the following way : @xmath87 is a basis of @xmath4 , obtained by choosing a certain amount of vectors from the basis @xmath85 , let us say vectors @xmath89 , then another amount of vectors @xmath90 from the basis @xmath86 , then again vectors @xmath91 from @xmath85 , etc .",
    "since we choose these vectors without changing the order in the two sequences @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and without skipping any of them , we get a basis @xmath87 of @xmath4 with @xmath92 .",
    "the vectors @xmath93 are finitely supported with respect to  the basis @xmath87 , @xmath94 , and for every @xmath95 they are such that @xmath96=\\textrm{sp}[f_{0},\\ldots , f_{j}]$ ] . in other words",
    ", @xmath93 belongs to the linear span of the vectors @xmath97 , and its @xmath98 coordinate in the basis @xmath87 is non - zero .",
    "the operator  @xmath6 is defined on the set of finitely supported vectors with respect to  the basis @xmath87 by the formula @xmath99 if the vectors @xmath93 are suitably constructed , it will be possible to extend @xmath6 into a bounded operator  on @xmath4 , which hopefully will have few invariant  closed subsets .",
    "the construction of the vectors @xmath100 and @xmath93 , @xmath101 , is done by induction . at step @xmath56 , @xmath100 and @xmath93",
    "are defined for @xmath102 belonging to a certain interval @xmath103 $ ] , where @xmath104 is a sequence of integers with @xmath105 which will be chosen to grow very fast .",
    "there are different types of definitions for the vectors @xmath93 for @xmath106 $ ] , depending on whether @xmath102 lies in some sub - intervals of @xmath106 $ ] which are called _ working intervals _ , or in their complement which consists of _ lay - off intervals_. working intervals are those on which something happens .",
    "they are separated by very long lay - off intervals , on which @xmath6 acts simply as a ( forward ) weighted shift , and their role is to allow us to sew harmoniously the working intervals together , and to prevent side effects from one working interval  on another .",
    "when @xmath102 belongs to a lay - off interval , @xmath93 is defined by the relation @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a positive coefficient which is very large if @xmath102 lies in the beginning of the lay - off interval  and very small if it lies towards the end , with @xmath109 extremely close to @xmath15 . when both @xmath102 and @xmath110 belong to a lay - off interval , @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath6 acts on these vectors as a weighted shift with weights very close to @xmath15 .",
    "working intervals are of three types , which we call ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) . the ( c)-part is the part which makes property ( p1 ) hold true ; then adding the ( b)-part yields property ( p2 ) . the ( a)-part is the part in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which provides the vectors belonging to the closures of the orbits of non - zero  vectors .",
    "the ( c)- and ( b)-parts of a read s type construction use only the copy of the space @xmath32 or @xmath1 which is present in the decomposition of @xmath4 as @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "the space @xmath28 is simply incorporated in the construction , but could as well be dispensed with : non - reflexivity plays no role here , and this is why operators  enjoying properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) could be constructed in the hilbertian setting in @xcite .",
    "but non - reflexivity becomes crucial in the construction of the ( a)-part .",
    "the way non - reflexivity appears here is via a result of zippin @xcite which characterizes reflexive  spaces within the class of spaces having a schauder basis .",
    "it states that a space @xmath28 having a schauder basis is reflexive  if and only if  all the schauder bases of @xmath28 are boundedly complete .",
    "recall that if @xmath114 is a schauder basis of @xmath28 , @xmath114 is said to be _ boundedly complete _ if whenever @xmath115 is a sequence of scalars such that @xmath116 is finite , the series @xmath117 is automatically convergent in @xmath28 .",
    "the prototype of a non - boundedly complete basis in a non - reflexivebanach space is the canonical basis @xmath118 of @xmath1 : @xmath119 but @xmath120 does not converge in @xmath1 .",
    "the result of @xcite is that such a basis @xmath114 exists in any non - reflexive  space with a schauder basis .",
    "we will actually need a more precise version of the result of zippin , which follows from the proof of @xcite , and is also proved in a more general context in kalton s paper @xcite : if @xmath28 is a non - reflexive  banach space with a schauder basis , it admits a schauder basis @xmath114 with @xmath121 which is not _ semi - boundedly complete _ : there exists a sequence of positive scalars @xmath115 and a strictly increasing sequence @xmath122 of integers such that @xmath123 is finite but the sequence @xmath115 is bounded away from zero .",
    "in particular the series @xmath124 obviously can not converge in @xmath28 .",
    "very roughly speaking , this basis @xmath114 of @xmath28 is used in the construction of the ( a)-part in the following way : for instance in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] , we choose @xmath125 and @xmath126 as above , with @xmath127 .",
    "the construction is done in such a way that for any non - zero  vector @xmath51 the distance of @xmath128 to @xmath39 can be made arbitrarily small for infinitely many integers @xmath14 .",
    "hence the distance of @xmath50 to @xmath39 is less than @xmath54 .",
    "the construction fails if the series @xmath129 is convergent to a certain point @xmath130 , because the construction of the operator  @xmath6 forces the norms of the vectors @xmath131 to go to zero as @xmath14 goes to infinity .",
    "then necessarily @xmath132 .",
    "since the orbit of every non - zero  vector under the action of @xmath6 comes within @xmath54-distance of @xmath50 infinitely many times , this forces @xmath133 to be equal to @xmath134 , which is impossible .",
    "we now suppose that the assumptions of theorem [ th2 ] are in force .",
    "we denote by @xmath47 the canonical basis of either @xmath32 or @xmath1 , and by @xmath114 a non semi - boundedly complete basis of @xmath28 as above .",
    "then there exists a sequence of positive scalars @xmath115 which is bounded away from zero ( there exists a @xmath135 such that @xmath136 for every @xmath137 ) and a strictly increasing sequence @xmath122 of integers such that @xmath138 .",
    "the way of defining the operator  is similar in many places to the one employed in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , so we will sometimes refer the reader to these works for some details .",

    "if @xmath144 is a polynomial , the modulus @xmath145 of @xmath146 is @xmath147 .",
    "we construct by induction on @xmath56 :    @xmath148 a sequence @xmath149 of integers increasing very quickly ;    @xmath148 two sequences @xmath150 and @xmath151 of vectors of @xmath4 , where at step @xmath56 the vectors @xmath100 and @xmath93 are constructed for @xmath106 $ ] ;    @xmath148 two sequences @xmath152 and @xmath153 of integers increasing very quickly ;    @xmath148 a sequence @xmath154 of positive numbers going very quickly to zero and a sequence @xmath155 of integers going to infinity in a suitable fashion ;    @xmath148 for each @xmath156 , a sequence @xmath157 of polynomials which form an @xmath158-net of the closed ball of @xmath159 $ ] of radius @xmath160 for the norm @xmath161 , and a sequence @xmath162 of integers also increasing very quickly .",

    "the sequence @xmath648 will play the role of the non semi - boundedly complete basis of @xmath28 in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] , but of course it is now boundedly complete in @xmath1161 .",

    "we have @xmath1163 set @xmath1164 for each @xmath95 .",
    "with these choices of the sequences @xmath648 , @xmath650 and @xmath1165 , we construct the operator  @xmath6 exactly as in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] ( in particular @xmath1166 ) .",
    "then @xmath6 is a bounded operator  on @xmath36 , and we have the following obvious fact :    [ factnewa ] for every @xmath187 we have @xmath1167 the sequence @xmath1168 converges in norm in @xmath36 to the vector @xmath1169 , where @xmath1170    the convergence of the sequence @xmath1168 is the most crucial difference with what happens in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] . since @xmath1171 for each @xmath156 , it follows that @xmath1172 . the vector @xmath1169 being obviously non - zero , @xmath6 is not an injective operator .",
    "let us now review the various steps in the proof of theorem [ th2 ] , and see whether they still hold true or not in this new context .",
    "fact [ factb ] is obviously still true , while fact [ factbis ] is wrong since the sequence @xmath650 is not bounded away from zero .",
    "but the same proof shows that    [ factnewb ] there exists a positive constant @xmath7 such that @xmath1173 for each @xmath156 .",
    "the fact that the norm of @xmath389 is a bit larger than previously does not change anything to the relevant parts of the proof ( actually , and this was used in the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , the only important thing is that the norm of @xmath389 is controlled for each @xmath156 by a quantity which depends only on @xmath169 ) .",
    "thus , going again through the proof , we see that proposition [ prop2 ] still holds true in this hilbertian setting .",
    "now we come to an important difference between the non - reflexive and the hilbertian cases , which is that , for a vector @xmath38 , @xmath386 does not necessarily tend to @xmath22 as @xmath56 tends to infinity . indeed , since @xmath1174 @xmath1175 converges to zero if and only if  @xmath1176 tends to zero as @xmath56 tends to infinity , which is of course not always the case ( actually , the important point is that @xmath1177 may be strictly positive ) .",
    "so facts [ factc ] and [ factd ] are not true anymore here .",
    "this is a difficulty we already faced in the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , and so at this point we shift from the proof of theorem [ th2 ] to the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , and observe that proposition [ prop5bis ] holds true here .",
    "also , it is not difficult to check , thanks to the remark above , that if @xmath38 is a vector such that @xmath1176 tends to zero as @xmath56 tends to infinity , then the closure of the orbit of @xmath22 under the action of @xmath6 coincides with the closure of the linear span of this orbit . in other words , property ( p1 ) is true for these vectors @xmath22 . in particular , the vector @xmath1166 is still a hypercyclic  vector for @xmath6 .",
    "the most important step in the proof of theorem [ th3bis ] is the following proposition :    [ propnewc ] if @xmath597 is a sequence of positive real numbers such that each @xmath616 is sufficiently large with respect to  @xmath169 , the following statement holds true :    for any vector @xmath22 in @xmath36 with @xmath474 which is not colinear to @xmath1178 , and for any integer @xmath583 , there exist an @xmath476 and a @xmath598 $ ] such that @xmath1179    it is important to remark that this analogue of proposition [ prop5 ] can not hold true for _ all _ vectors @xmath22 of norm @xmath15 : if we choose @xmath1180 , then @xmath609}x_{0}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\alpha _ { j}z_{j}+e_{0}=e_{a_{n}},\\ ] ] so that @xmath1181 .",
    "so the conclusion of proposition [ propnewc ] does not hold true for the vector @xmath1182 .",
    "but these are the only vectors for which such a situation can take place .",
    "the beginning of the proof is the same as that of proposition [ prop5 ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 , with @xmath474 , is such that for every @xmath1183 and every @xmath598 $ ] , @xmath1184 the same argument as in the proof of proposition [ prop5 ] shows then that the quantity @xmath1185}x - e_{a_{n}}^{*(a_{n})}(x)e_{a_{n}}||$ ] tends to @xmath440 as @xmath56 tends to infinity , i.e. that @xmath1186 tends to @xmath22 .",

    "where @xmath1487 or @xmath1491 , @xmath339 belongs to the linear span of the vectors @xmath1497 .",
    "we now apply exactly the same procedure at steps @xmath171 , then at step @xmath1498 , etc . in order to obtain that for each @xmath1499 , @xmath1500\\setminus\\{a_{m}-1,a_{m}\\},\\ ] ] and that @xmath339 belongs to the linear span of the vectors @xmath1501 for every @xmath1502 .",
    "this proves the claim .    setting @xmath1503 to be the supremum of all these quantities @xmath1504 for @xmath1505",
    ", we have eventually obtained that @xmath1506 . for each",
    "@xmath56 sufficiently large ( [ 44bis ] ) holds true , where the constant @xmath1503 depends only on the construction until step @xmath56 while @xmath1442 is chosen after the construction at step @xmath56 is completed .",
    "so we can for each @xmath156 choose @xmath1507 so small that @xmath1508 . making @xmath56 tend to infinity in ( [ 44bis ] ) yields that @xmath1509 equation ( [ zero ] ) can hence be rewritten as @xmath1510 the second sum as well as the third term in this expression belong to the closed linear span of the vectors @xmath1511 and @xmath1495 for @xmath902 .",
    "also , if @xmath102 does not belong to @xmath276 , @xmath110 can not be equal to @xmath169 or @xmath1512 for some @xmath156 , nor to @xmath440 .",
    "it follows that @xmath1513 for every @xmath1369 .",
    "putting things together , we see that we have proved that @xmath1513 for every @xmath101 not belonging to the set @xmath1514 .",
    "this finishes the proof of lemma [ factbizarre ] .",
    "we now go back to the proof of proposition [ propbizarre ] .",
    "consider , as in the proof of theorem [ th4 ] , the operator  @xmath1515 acting on @xmath32 .",
    "for every @xmath1387 we have @xmath1516 if both @xmath102 and @xmath110 do not belong to @xmath276 , then @xmath1517 . if @xmath102 does not belong to @xmath276 but @xmath110 does , then @xmath1518 .",
    "it follows that @xmath1519 i.e. that @xmath1520 where @xmath1521 and @xmath1522 are operators  on @xmath32 defined as @xmath1523 and @xmath1524 then the operator  @xmath1522 is easily seen to be nuclear , as @xmath1525 by ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the operator  @xmath1521 is a forward weighted shift on @xmath32 , which we can further decompose as in remark [ remadd ] as the sum of a contraction and a compact operator : setting @xmath1526 and @xmath1527 we have @xmath1528 , where @xmath1529 is a contraction on @xmath32 and @xmath1530 is a compact operator .",
    "denote by @xmath1531 the kernel of @xmath1234 , and by @xmath1532 the quotient space @xmath1533 .",
    "let @xmath1534 and @xmath1535 be the operators  defined by @xmath1536 for every @xmath1537 , and @xmath1538 for every @xmath1387 .",
    "obviously @xmath1539 , and @xmath1540 is a bounded operator  on @xmath1532 .",
    "lemma [ factbizarre ] now implies that @xmath1531 is invariant by the operator  @xmath1529 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath366 belongs to @xmath1531 , then @xmath1513 for every @xmath102 not belonging to the set @xmath1514 .",
    "so in particular @xmath1513 for every @xmath102 such that @xmath102 and @xmath110 do not belong to @xmath276 .",
    "thus @xmath1541 . in particular",
    "@xmath1542 , and it makes sense to define @xmath1543 by setting @xmath1544 for @xmath1387 .",
    "hence @xmath1545 can be decomposed as @xmath1546 , where @xmath1547 is a contraction of @xmath1532 and @xmath1548 is a compact operator  on @xmath1532 .",
    "so @xmath1549 for every @xmath156 .",
    "if the space @xmath4 is complex , @xmath1532 is a complex reflexive banach space and we can apply the lomonosov inequality to the weakly closed sub - algebra of @xmath1550 generated by @xmath1551 : there exist two non - zero  vectors @xmath1552 and @xmath1553 such that @xmath1554 for every @xmath156 .",
    "so the closure of the orbit of the vector @xmath1552 under the action of @xmath1545 is a non - trivial  invariant  closed subset of @xmath1545 .",
    "since @xmath1555 has dense range and @xmath1556 is injective , the same reasoning as in the proof of theorem [ th4 ] implies then that @xmath6 itself has a non - trivial  invariant  closed subset , which is an invariant  subspace by property ( p1 ) .",
    "proposition [ propbizarre ] is hence proved in the complex case .",
    "if @xmath4 is a real banach space , we need to go back to the proof of theorem @xmath15 in @xcite in order to show that @xmath1545 has a non - trivial  invariant  closed subset in @xmath1532 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that lemma @xmath1557 as well as the main part of lemma @xmath1558 of @xcite hold true in the real case as well , so that we have the following result :      ( a1 ) there exist two non - zero  vectors @xmath1355 and @xmath1559 such that @xmath1560 is dense in @xmath1253 for every non - zero  vector @xmath1355 , and in this case there exist an operator  @xmath1561 , different from the identity operator , such that @xmath15 is an eigenvalue of @xmath1562 .",
    "let @xmath1351 be the uniformly closed sub - algebra of @xmath1550 generated by the operator  @xmath1551 .",
    "if ( a1 ) of theorem [ thlom ] above holds true , then we know that @xmath1545 has a non - trivial  invariant  closed subset in @xmath1532 , and we are done .",
    "so suppose that ( a2 ) is true : since @xmath1532 is reflexive , there exist an operator  @xmath1563 and a non - zero  vector @xmath1564 such that @xmath1565 is not the identity operator  and @xmath1566 .",
    "since @xmath1351 is commutative , we have @xmath1567 for every @xmath1356 .",
    "assumption ( a2 ) implies that the set @xmath1568 is dense in @xmath1532 , so @xmath1569 which is impossible .",
    "so ( a2 ) can not hold , and ( a1 ) is true .",
    "this proves proposition [ propbizarre ] in the real case .",
    "the operator  @xmath6 is induced by an operator  @xmath1571 acting on @xmath1570 on one of its invariant  subspaces @xmath346 , where @xmath1571 is one of the operators  on @xmath1570 given by theorem [ th2 ] for some @xmath49 .",
    "the proof of proposition [ propbizarre ] above , plus the observation that the space @xmath1572 is isometric to @xmath13 in this case , show that @xmath1571 can be factorized through the space @xmath13 in the following way : there exist @xmath1573 with dense range and @xmath1574 injective such that @xmath1575 .",
    "let us now define @xmath36 to be the closure in @xmath13 of the linear space @xmath1576 .",
    "then @xmath36 is a hilbert space , and since @xmath346 is @xmath6-invariant  the operator  @xmath1577 maps @xmath36 into @xmath346 .",
    "it follows that the operator  @xmath1578 defined on @xmath13 leaves @xmath36 invariant .",
    "moreover , we have seen in the proof of proposition [ propbizarre ] that @xmath1545 could be written as @xmath1546 , where @xmath1579 and @xmath1548 is a compact operator  on @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath1580 be the operator  induced by @xmath1545 on @xmath36 . if @xmath1581 denotes the canonical injection of @xmath36 into @xmath13 and @xmath1582 denotes the orthogonal projection of @xmath13 onto @xmath36 , then @xmath1583 , and @xmath1584 is again a contraction on @xmath36 while @xmath1585 is compact .",
    "proceeding in the same way as in the proof of proposition [ propbizarre ] , we see that @xmath1580 has a non - trivial  invariant  closed subset .",
