    "in these proceedings , the contribution by burgay et al .  describes the discovery of the compact double neutron star system j0737@xmath03039 and its implication for the detection rate for ground - based gravitational wave detectors and tests of general relativity ( see also burgay et al .",
    "2003 ) . with the discovery of radio pulses from the companion , the system becomes unique in its potential as a testbed for relativistic gravity . the data resulting in the timing parameters presented for both pulsars by lyne et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and shown in table 1 , were obtained with the parkes radio telescope and the lovell telescope at jodrell bank .",
    "an updated timing solution covering a full year of observations will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( kramer et al .  in prep .",
    "the contribution by manchester et al .  discusses the implications for studying pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "since neutron stars are very compact massive objects , double neutron star ( dns ) binaries can be considered as almost ideal point sources for testing theories of gravity in the strong - gravitational - field limit .",
    "tests can be performed when a number of relativistic corrections to the keplerian description of the orbit , the so - called `` post - keplerian '' ( pk ) parameters , can be measured . for point masses with negligible spin contributions , the pk parameters in each theory",
    "should only be functions of the a priori unknown neutron star masses , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the well measurable keplerian parameters . with the two masses as the only free parameters",
    ", the measurement of three or more pk parameters over - constrains the system , and thereby provides a test ground for theories of gravity . in a theory that describes the binary system correctly ,",
    "the pk parameters produce theory - dependent lines in a mass - mass diagram that all intersect in a single point .",
    "( see contributions by weisberg & taylor for an update on the tests provided by psr b1913 + 16 and by stairs et al .  for tests",
    "possible with psr  b1534 + 12 . )",
    "as shown in table  1 , we have measured psr j0737@xmath03037a s advance of periastron , @xmath3 , and the gravitational redshift / time dilation parameter @xmath4 and have also detected the shapiro delay in the pulse arrival times of a due to the gravitational field of psr j0737@xmath03039b ( see fig .  1 ) , providing a precise measurement of the orbital inclination of @xmath5 and the `` range '' parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this already provides four measured pk parameters , resulting in a @xmath7 plot shown in figure  2 where we label @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 as predicted by general relativity ( damour & deruelle 1986 ) .",
    "in addition to tests with these pk parameters , the detection of b as a pulsar opens up opportunities that go well beyond what is possible with previously known dnss . with a measurement of the projected semi - major axes of the orbits of both a and b ( see table 1 ) , we obtain a precise measurement of the mass ratio , @xmath12 , providing a further constraint displayed in figure  2 . for every realistic theory of gravity , we can expect the mass ratio , @xmath13 , to follow this simple relation ( damour & taylor 1992 ) .",
    "most importantly , the @xmath13-line is not only theory - independent , but also independent of strong - field ( self - field ) effects which is not the case for pk - parameters .",
    "this provides a stringent and new constraint for tests of gravitational theories as any intersection of the pk - parameters _ must _ be located on the @xmath13-line in fig .  2 . with four pk parameters already available ,",
    "this additional constraint makes j07373039 the most overdetermined dns system to date where the most relativistic effects can be studied in the strong - field limit .    .observed and derived parameters of psrs  j0737@xmath03039a and b.",

    "we expect to measure the orbital period derivative , @xmath14 , by autumn 2004 .",
    "we note that the distance to this pulsar will be needed to correctly account for relative accelerations and hence to interpret @xmath14 in the context of gravitational theories .",
    "vlbi observations to determine the system s parallax are underway . in the longer term , further effects should be measurable .      in general relativity ,",
    "the proper reference frame of a freely - falling object suffers a precession with respect to a distant observer , called geodetic precession . in a binary pulsar system this geodetic precession leads to a relativistic spin - orbit coupling , analogous of spin - orbit coupling in atomic physics ( damour & ruffini 1974 ) . as a consequence , the pulsar spin precesses about the total angular momentum , changing the relative orientation of the pulsar towards earth .",
    "since the orbital angular momentum is much larger than the pulsars spins , the total angular momentum is practically represented by the orbital spin . the precession rate ( barker & oconnell 1975 , brner et al .  1975 )",
    "depends on the period and the eccentricity of the orbit as well as the pulsar and companion mass . with the parameters shown in table 1 , general relativity predicts precession periods of only 75  yr for a and 71  yr for b.    geodetic precession should have a direct effect on the timing as it causes the polar angles of the spins and hence the effects of aberration to change with time ( damour & taylor 1992 ) .",
    "these changes modify the _ observed _ orbital parameters , like projected semi - major axis and eccentricity , which differ from the _ intrinsic _ values by an aberration dependent term , potentially allowing us to infer the system geometry . other consequences of geodetic precession can be expected to be detected much sooner .",
    "these arise from changes in the pulse shape and its polarisation properties due to changing cuts through the emission beam as the pulsar spin axis precesses . due to these effects ,",
    "which may complicate the toa determination , geodetic precession is detected for psrs b1913 + 16 ( kramer 1998 ; weisberg & taylor , these proceedings ) and b1534 + 12 ( arzoumanian 1995 ; stairs et al . , these proceedings ) . for psr b1913 + 16",
    "it is used to derive a two - dimensional map of the emission beam ( weisberg & taylor 2002 ) and to determine the full system geometry leading to the prediction that the pulsar will not be observable from earth around 2025 ( kramer 1998 ) . since the precession rates for a and b are about four times larger",
    ", the visible effects in j0737@xmath03039 should be much easier to detect .      in all previous tests of general relativity involving pk parameters",
    ", it was sufficient to compare the observed values to theoretical expressions computed to their lowest post - newtonian approximation .",
    "however , higher - order corrections may become important if relativistic effects are large and timing precision is sufficiently high . whilst this has not been the case in the past",
    ", the double pulsar system may allow measurements of these effects in the future ( see lyne et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "higher - order corrections to the present description of the light propagation would account for the assumptions currently made in the computation of the shapiro delay that gravitational potentials are static and weak everywhere .",
    "corresponding calculations taking these next higher order corrections into account have been presented by wex ( 1995a ) , kopeikin & schfer ( 1999 ) and kopeikin ( 2003 ) .",
    "in addition to light propagation effects causing time delays , others exist that are related to light bending and its consequences .",
    "light bending as discussed by doroshenko & kopeikin ( 1995 ) would be superposed on the shapiro delay as a typically much weaker signal , which arises due to a modulation of the pulsars rotational phase by the effect of gravitational deflection of the light in the field of the pulsar s companion .",
    "this aberration - like effect would only be visible for very nearly edge - on systems since it depends crucially on the orientation of the pulsar s spin - axis in space .",
    "the double pulsar system fulfils these requirements .",
    "in contrast to newtonian physics , general relativity predicts that the neutron stars spins affect their orbital motion via spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this effect would be most clearly visible as a contribution to the observed @xmath3 in a secular ( barker & oconnell 1975 ) , and periodic fashion ( wex 1995b ) . for the j0737@xmath03039 system ,",
    "the expected contribution is about an order of magnitude larger than for psr b1913 + 16 ( lyne et al .",
    "2004 ) , i.e.  @xmath15 deg yr@xmath16 ( for a , assuming a geometry as determined for psr b1913 + 16 ; kramer 1998 ) .",
    "as the exact value depends on the pulsars moment of inertia , a potential measurement of this effect would allow us the moment of inertia of a neutron star to be determined for the first time ( damour & schfer 1988 ) .",
    "if two parameters , e.g.  the shapiro parameter @xmath17 and the mass ratio @xmath13 , can be measured sufficiently accurately , an expected @xmath18 can be computed from the intersection point .",
    "this value can be compared to the observed value @xmath19 which is given by ( see damour & schfer 1988 ) @xmath20,\\ ] ] where the last two terms represent contributions from the pulsars spins . in these terms , @xmath21 are geometry - dependent factors whilst @xmath22 arise from relativistic spin - orbit coupling ( barker & oconnell 1975 ) , formally at the level of first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) approximation .",
    "however , it turns out that for binary pulsars these effects have a magnitude equivalent to second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) order ( wex 1995b ) , so that they only need to be considered if @xmath3 is to be studied at this higher level of approximation .",
    "we find @xmath23 ( damour & schfer 1988 ) , so that with precisely measured masses @xmath24 the moment of inertia @xmath25 can be measured and the neutron star equation - of - state and our understanding of matter at extreme pressure and densities can be tested .",
    "the dependence of @xmath26 on the spin period @xmath27 suggests that only a measurement for pulsar @xmath28 can be obtained .",
    "it also requires that at least two other parameters can be measured to a similar accuracy as @xmath3 . despite being a tough challenge , e.g.  due to the expected profile variation caused by geodetic precession , the prospects are promising .",
    "simulations indicate that a few years of high precision timing are sufficient ( kramer et al .  in prep .",
    "the double pulsar system offers improved but also new tests of general relativity .",
    "the current data indicate an agreement of the observed with the expected shapiro parameter of @xmath29 ( kramer et al .  in prep .",
    ") where the uncertainties are likely to decrease , enabling the other discussed applications .",
