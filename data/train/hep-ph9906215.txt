    "the search for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is an ongoing endeavor .",
    "usually , a search for new physics implies investigating higher and higher energy regime where new physics effects are expected to appear .",
    "nevertheless , it remains a necessary and useful approach to study the low - energy regime where interesting phenomena may be expected in a particular model .",
    "the work presented here is an example where new physics diminishes in some of the very low - energy processes and flourishes in the others .",
    "the flavor physics of the third generation is particularly mysterious for the smallness of the mixing angles and the huge hierarchy in masses .",
    "furthermore , the heavy top quark mass can be an indication for a new dynamics in the third fermion generation different from the first two generations .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the idea of treating the third generation differently from the first two generations in the context of strong or electroweak interactions .",
    "fortunately , the already available low energy data can largly constrain such a picture . in this regard ,",
    "several studies have been pursued in the literature . in the context of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "interaction , we refer the reader to refs .  @xcite . in the context of the electroweak interaction ,",
    "several published works also exist . as an example , in the context of tecnicolor theories , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the idea that the third generation carries a seperate @xmath19 was proposed in refs .",
    "the two models in refs .",
    "@xcite differ in the assignment of the quantum numbers to the higgs sector which leads to different phenomenological implications .",
    "constraints from low energy data on such models have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed a model in which the third generation feels a different gauge dynamics ( with a new @xmath19 gauged symmetry ) from the usual weak interaction proposed in the sm .",
    "( no modification to the qcd interaction was considered , because that case has been discussed elsewhere @xcite . ) consequently , a new spectrum of gauge bosons emerges in the model .",
    "we , then , used the available cern large electron positron ( lep ) and slac stanford linear collider ( slc ) data to constrain the parameters of the model .",
    "we found the model to be consistent with data ( at the 3@xmath20 level ) as long as the heavy gauge boson mass is larger than 1.3 tev .",
    "a similar conclusion was also found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this current work ,",
    "we first update the previous analysis on constraining the parameter space of the proposed model using the most recent lep and slc data @xcite , then discuss the zero - momentum transfer physics in the low - energy regime where interesting effects may be expected in both lepton and quark sectors .",
    "we find that flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) may exist in the lepton sector and are unavoidable in the quark sector . as a consequence , neutrinos can mix via gauge interaction despite of their zero mass .",
    "furthermore , deviations from the sm predictions are expected for some particular low - energy processes .",
    "for example , the decay process @xmath21 can impose a stronger constraint than the @xmath0-pole data for some particular parameter space .",
    "similarly , the @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing and the rare decay rates of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons , such as @xmath11 and @xmath22 are expected to exceed the sm prediction for some region of the parameter space .",
    "non - sm decay modes , such as @xmath23 , can also occur .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly review the model . in sec . 3",
    ", we discuss the constraints on the model from the @xmath0-pole data at lep and slc . after a general discussion on the possible new effects on low energy data in sec .",
    "4 , we discuss all possible new physics effects , including all fcnc processes as predicted by this model , in secs . 5 and 6 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "for the detailed structure of the model , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . in this section",
    "we only outline the main features of the proposed model .",
    "the model is based on the gauge symmetry g=  @xmath24 .",
    "the third generation of fermions ( top quark , @xmath25 , bottom quark , @xmath26 , tau lepton , @xmath27 , and its neutrino , @xmath28 ) experiences a new gauge interaction , instead of the usual weak interaction advocated by the sm . on the contrary , the first and second generations only feel the weak interaction supposedly equivalent to the sm case .",
    "the new gauge dynamics is attributed to the @xmath29 symmetry under which the left - handed fermions of the third generation transform in the fundamental representation ( doublets ) , while they remain to be singlets under the @xmath30 symmetry . on the other hand , the left - handed fermions of the first and second generation",
    "transform as doublets under the @xmath30 group and singlets under the @xmath29 group .",
    "the @xmath31 group is the sm hypercharge group .",
    "the right - handed fermions only transform under the @xmath32 group as assigned by the sm . finally the qcd interactions and the color symmetry @xmath33 are the same as that in the sm .",
    "the symmetry breaking of the lie group g into the electromagnetic group @xmath34 is a two - stage mechanism .",
    "first , @xmath35 breaks down into @xmath36 at some large energy scale .",
    "the second stage is that @xmath36 breaks down into @xmath34 at an energy scale about the same as the sm electroweak symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry - breaking of the group @xmath37 is accomplished by introducing two scalar matrix fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 which transform as @xmath40 i.e. , the @xmath38 field transforms as a doublet under both @xmath30 and @xmath29 and as a singlet under @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath39 field transforms as a doublet under @xmath30 , as a singlet under @xmath29 , and its hypercharge quantum number @xmath41 is 1 .",
    "thus , the scalar doublet @xmath39 carries equivalent quantum numbers as the sm higgs doublet .    as a realization of the symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 fields transform as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . for completeness",
    ", we briefly discuss the structure of the boson and lepton sectors as follows .",
    "the covariant derivatives of the scalar fields are defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and where @xmath48 are the gauge boson fields of the @xmath49 groups , respectively .",
    "( @xmath50 s are the pauli matrices , and @xmath51 . )    with these definitions , the gauge invariant lagrangian of the boson sector is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the scalar potential .",
    "we assume that the first stage of symmetry breaking is accomplished through the @xmath54 field by acquiring a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 the second stage is through the scalar @xmath57 field by acquiring a vacuum expectation value @xmath58 , so @xmath59 where @xmath58 is at the same order as the sm symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "because of this pattern of symmetry breaking , the gauge couplings are related to the @xmath34 gauge coupling @xmath60 by the relation @xmath61 we then define @xmath62 where @xmath63 plays the role of the usual weak mixing angle and @xmath64 is a new parameter of the model .",
    "the scalar fields , except @xmath65 from the @xmath57 doublet and @xmath20 from the @xmath66 matrix field , become the longitudinal components of the physical gauge bosons .",
    "the surviving @xmath65 field behaves similar to the sm higgs boson except that it does not have the usual yukawa couplings to the third generation .    to derive the mass eigenstates and physical masses of the gauge bosons , we need to diagonalize their mass matrices . for @xmath67 ( equivalently @xmath68 )",
    ", we require @xmath69 ( which implies @xmath70 ) so that the perturbation theory is valid .",
    "similarly , for @xmath71 , we require @xmath72 . for simplicity , we focus on the region where @xmath73 is much larger than 1 , and ignore the corrections which are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath74 . to the order @xmath74 , the light gauge boson masses are found to be @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 . while for the heavy gauge bosons , one finds @xmath78 it is interesting to notice that up to this order the heavy gauge bosons are degenerate in mass .",
    "this is because the heavy gauge bosons do not mix with the hypercharge gauge boson field , @xmath79 .      as discussed before",
    ", the third generation interacts with the @xmath29 gauge bosons , and the first and second generations interact with the @xmath30 gauge bosons .",
    "explicitly , under the @xmath80 symmetry , the quantum numbers of the fermions are assigned as follows .",

    "this can be an indication that the mass generation of the third family is due to a different mechanism than the first two generations .",
    "one way to realize this is to assume that our proposed symmetry can be embedded in a larger symmetry at a much higher energy scale .",
    "the breaking of the large symmetry is responsible for the generation of the third family masses as it is also responsible for the new non - universal gauge dynamics . at the low energy scale",
    "this can be effectively written in terms of higher dimension operators .",

    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath96 , so that the mass of @xmath92 is about equal to @xmath97 .",
    "thus , although the masses of the first and second generations are generated through the yukawa interactions as in the sm , the mass spectrum of third generation must be generated by a different mechanism .",
    "this conclusion may be attributed to strong flavor dynamics which could be evident at high energies , where the interactions become strong .",
    "another scenario @xcite for generating the third family masses in this model is to introduce an additional scalar doublet which only couples to the third generation through the usual yukawa interactions . in general",
    ", this scenario will introduce extra interaction terms to the gauge dynamics and will modify the conclusions presented in this paper .    given the fermion mass matrices , one can derive their physical masses by diagonalizing the mass matrices using bilinear unitary transformations .",

    "as previously mentioned , lepton mixing is an interesting feature of this model .",
    "however , because of the almost null measurement of @xmath229 and @xmath230 , we expect the mixing between the first and second lepton families to be highly suppressed .",

    "therefore , to keep the leading contribution of order @xmath237 , we set the total decay width , used in the above equation , to be the sm value .",

    "consequently , with this choice , this model predicts no transition between @xmath142 and @xmath60 leptons .",
    "although both cases of lepton mixing are allowed , it is more natural to assume the mixing strength between leptons to be directly related to their masses .",
    "if so , one would expect the mixing between the second and third families to be more significant than the first and third families .",

    "the phases in the matrix @xmath255 can be simply absorbed in the definitions of the lepton fields .",
    "it is easy to see that if there is no mixing among leptons , then all the leptonic decay rates are identical to the sm , and @xmath27 lifetime is not modified .",

    "the ratio @xmath280 , can be written as @xmath281 where @xmath282 is a phase factor given by @xcite @xmath283 hence , an increase by a factor of @xmath284 is expected in the above ratio .",
