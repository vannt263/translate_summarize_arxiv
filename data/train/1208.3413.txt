    "very recently the atlas and cms collaborations have independently reported the observation of a higgs - like resonance with a mass about 125 gev @xcite . at the same time , the cdf and d0 collaborations have also updated their combined results for the higgs searches in @xmath6 channel , which support the lhc observation @xcite . since in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) a sm - like higgs boson is predicted with a mass below 130 gev , the observation of such a 125 gev higgs boson supports susy , albeit quite restrictive on the parameter space of susy @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the direct searches for susy particles ( sparticles ) have been performed at the lhc .",
    "based on about 5 fb@xmath7 luminosity , the atlas and cms collaborations have reported null results and obtained some bounds on the sparticle masses , which is about 1 tev for the gluino and first generation of squarks @xcite , 330 gev for the electroweak gauginos , 180 gev for the sleptons @xcite , 465 gev for the stops and 480 gev for the sbottoms @xcite .",
    "these bounds indicate that susy may be heavier than expected and the sparticles may be significantly heavier than the electroweak scale @xcite .    in case that the sparticles are heavy and beyond the lhc scope of direct production ,",
    "search for the indirect susy effects via loop corrections will be of great importance .",
    "since the loop effects of heavy sparticles are usually small , we should look for some processes in which the heavy sparticles have residual loop effects .",
    "one type of such processes are higgs productions at the lhc , such as the production of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in which the heavy sparticles have sizable residual loop effects for a small value of @xmath3 and a large value of @xmath2 @xcite ( when @xmath3 getting large , such effects will vanish ) .",
    "the reason for these residual loop effects is that the couplings in the loops are proportional to some susy mass parameters and can be enhanced by the large values of @xmath2 .    in this note",
    "we focus on the production of @xmath10 at the lhc and calculate the complete one - loop susy qcd corrections to this process . as an important higgs production channel for the mssm",
    ", this production has been studied in the literature @xcite , where the residual susy qcd effects are found to be large ( reach -40% for @xmath11 ) .",
    "we revisit this production for the following reasons : firstly , in the literature the susy qcd corrections to this process are calculated only partially ( only the corrections to the @xmath10 vertex have been considered ) .",
    "the complete one - loop corrections involve pentagon feynman diagrams , whose calculations are rather complicated and have not been performed .",
    "secondly , the cms collaboration has recently measured this channel and given constraints on the plane of @xmath2 versus @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "since the residual susy qcd effects in this production is sensitive to the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we should update the calculations by considering such new constraints .",
    "moreover , other experimental constraints , such as the dark matter direct detection limits and the sm - like higgs boson mass around 125 gev , are also rather restrictive and should be considered . in this work ,",
    "we consdier all current experimental constraints to scan the mssm parameter space and then in the allowed parameter space we calculate the process @xmath12 with the complete one - loop susy qcd corrections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "we describe the calculations for the process @xmath12 .",
    "in sec.iii we show numerical results . finally , we draw the conclusions in sec",
    "in the mssm the lighter cp - even higgs mass ( @xmath13 ) is smaller than @xmath14 at tree level but receives large corrections at the loop level .",
    "the leading part of the corrections is from the stop sector and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the stop mixing parameter .",
    "we see that a large stop mass or a large stop mixing parameter is needed to increase @xmath13 to 125 gev . in our calculations",
    "we consider the collider constraints on the mssm higgs sector , using the packages @xcite and @xcite to calculate the observables in the higgs sector and require them to satisfy the constraints from the lep , tevatron and lhc .",
    "the susy qcd corrections to @xmath17 production at the lhc involve the sbottoms and gluino in the loops .",
    "the sbottom mass matrix takes the form @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the soft - breaking mass parameters for the left - handed squark doublet @xmath22 and the right - handed down squark @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the sbottom soft - breaking trilinear coupling and @xmath25 is the susy - preserving bilinear coupling of the two higgs doublets in the superpotential",
    ". this mass matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation which rotates the weak eigenstates @xmath26 to the mass eigenstates @xmath27 , @xmath28 with the sbottom masses @xmath29 and the mixing angle @xmath30 determined by @xmath31 , \\\\",

    "the numerical calculations are performed by using @xcite . in fig.1",
    "we display the representative pentagon feynman diagrams for the susy qcd corrections in the subprocesses @xmath32 . due to no massless particles in the loop , all the feynman diagrams with the gluino and sbottoms in the loops are infrared ( ir ) finite .",
    "we take the definitions of the scalar and tensor two- , three- , four- and five - point integral functions presented in ref.@xcite . for the calculation of the pentagon diagrams , we use passarino - veltman method@xcite to reduce the n - point(n @xmath33 5 ) tensor functions to scalar integrals .",
    "our programs have been used to study the susy - qcd corrections to the process @xmath34 at the lhc @xcite and have been checked with ref.@xcite therein . in order to further validate the calculation of the pentagon diagrams , we used our programs to calculate the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath35 in the sm at the lhc and compared with the results in ref.@xcite .",
    "as shown in table i , our results argee with those in ref.@xcite very well . in order to preserve supersymmetry , we adopt the constrained differential renormalization ( cdr ) @xcite to regulate the ultraviolet divergence ( uv ) in the self - energy and vertex corrections , which is equivalent to the dimensional reduction method at one - loop level @xcite .",
    ".[tab1 ] the comparison of our numerical results for the process @xmath36 in the sm at the lhc with those in ref.@xcite , where the lo and nlo qcd corrected cross sections for different higgs mass are listed with the relevant parameters and the pdfs being the same as in ref.@xcite , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38  gev and the mrst pdfs . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our calculations , we assume a common susy mass @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 .",
    "we fix slepton mass parameters @xmath41 tev and scan the following mssm parameter regions : @xmath42 in our scan we consider the following constraints on the parameter space : ( i ) we require that the bounds for higgs bosons from lep , tevatron and lhc are satisfied and the mass of light cp - even higgs is in the region of 123 gev@xmath43 129 gev ; ( ii ) for the constraints from flavor physics and electroweak precision tata , we checked by using the package @xcite that they are safely satisfied because we assume relatively heavy sparticles .",
    "( iii ) we consider the dark matter constraints from the wmap relic density and the direct detection results by using the package @xcite .",
    "since the b - quark yukawa coupling may receive large radiative corrections in the mssm , we use the running b - quark mass ( @xmath44 ) and use the method induced in @xcite to absorb the mssm corrections into the effective b - quark yukawa couplings . but for the b - quark in the final state , we take the pole mass to assure the correct on - shell behavior .    in our numerical calculations ,",
    "we take the input parameters of the sm as @xcite @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the qcd-@xmath47 bottom - quark mass , which is related to @xmath44 as @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the number of the active quark flavors . for the strong coupling constant @xmath50",
    ", we take its 2-loop evolution with qcd parameter @xmath51 and get @xmath52 .",
    "we use cteq6l1 and cteq6 m @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdf ) for the sm tree level and susy qcd one - loop level computations , respectively . the renormalization scale @xmath53 and factorization scale @xmath54",
    "are chosen to be @xmath55 .",
    "we numerically checked that all the uv divergence in the loop corrections canceled .     versus @xmath56 .",
    "the blue region is excluded by the lhc data , in particular , by the search of new particles decaying into @xmath57 and the measurement of @xmath58 .",
    "the yellow region is excluded by the non - observation of higgs boson at lep2 .",
    "the red dots represent the samples survied all the constraints.,width=384,height=336 ]    in fig.2 we project the survived samples satisfying all the experimental constraints on the planes of @xmath2 and @xmath59 versus @xmath56 and also present the excluded regions .",
    "it can be seen that a large part of the parameter space ( the light blue region ) has been ruled out by the 7 tev lhc data , in particular , by the search of new particles decaying into @xmath57 and the measurement of @xmath58 .",
    "for the small @xmath2 and low and moderate @xmath60 region , it has been excluded by the non - observation of higgs boson at lep2 .",
    "we also note that , with the very recently released 7 + 8 tev lhc results of @xmath61 based on @xmath62 fb@xmath7@xcite , the excluded lower limit on the plane of @xmath63 has been further pushed down and overlaps with the one of lep2 in the low @xmath60 case . since we require the higgs boson mass to be in the range of 123 - 129 gev indicated by the lhc data(126@xmath643 gev ) , the parameter space that can correctly produce the higgs boson mass is highly constrained and situated in a region with a modest @xmath60 ( @xmath65 gev ) and a small @xmath2 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , for other parts of the parameters space , they produce a too heavy higgs boson ( @xmath67 gev when @xmath68 ) or a too light higgs boson ( @xmath69 gev when @xmath70 ) .    ) versus @xmath60 and @xmath2 for the samples satisfying(red triangles ) or not satisfying(green dots ) the lhc constraints .",
    "the lower panel shows the susy - qcd corrections from the contributions of pentagon diagrams(@xmath71 ) for the red triangle samples.,width=480,height=432 ]    in fig.3 we present seperately the pentagon diagram contribution ( lower panel ) and the total susy - qcd contribution ( upper panel ) for the surviving samples . in order to show the influence of the recent lhc data , we present the complete one - loop susy qcd corrections for the samples satisfying or not satisfying the lhc constraints .",
    "we can see that the complete susy qcd corrections will be significant for the samples which have a large @xmath2 and a low value of @xmath3 .",
    "this can be understood by the contribution to the effective b - quark yukawa coupling after integration of the heavy sparticles , which is @xmath72 $ ] @xcite .",
    "since we assume @xmath73 , the yukawa coupling will be independent of the sparticle masses and be greatly enhanced by a large @xmath2 .",
    "however , it should be noted that these samples will lead to the excess of the production rate of @xmath74 and thus have been excluded by the current measurements . with the increase of @xmath3 and the decrease of @xmath2 , the corrections drop rapidly and approach zero in the decoupling limit .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath75 can be heavily reduced by the cancellation between @xmath2 and @xmath76 , which have a relation as @xmath77 for a large @xmath56 . from the lower panel of fig.3",
    ", we see that contributions of those pentagon diagrams are small and maximally reach about 0.8% .",
    "this is because in those pentagon diagrams the higgs boson only couples to sbottoms while the @xmath17 vertex does not appear .",
    "so the large residual loop effects in the @xmath17 vertex are absent in the pentagon diagrams .",
    "for the samples which survived all the constraints , the complete susy qcd corrections can only reach about @xmath5 at the lhc with @xmath1 tev .",
    "detecting such a size of susy qcd effects may be challenging in the future measurement of the process @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "in this work , we calculated the complete one - loop susy qcd corrections to the process @xmath0 at the lhc with @xmath1 tev .",
    "we found that the large susy qcd corrections in the non - decoupling regime with a large @xmath2 and a low @xmath3 has been excluded by the latest results of lhc non - standard higgs searches .",
    "for the survived decoupling regime which have modest values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the susy qcd corrections can maximally reach @xmath5 .",
