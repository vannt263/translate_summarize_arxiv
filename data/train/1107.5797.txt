    "the propulsion of some industrial fluids are take place by this mechanism .",
    "peristaltic transport has also found various applications in roller and finger pumps , heart - lung machines , blood pump machines , dialysis machines and also transport of noxious fluid in nuclear industries .",
    "a few theoretical studies on peristaltic transport of different physiological fluids were carried out by usha and rao @xcite , mishra and rao @xcite , misra et al @xcite , as well as eytan et al . @xcite .",
    "the analyses were mostly restricted to consideration of small peristaltic wave amplitude and the assumption that the fluid inertia is negligible .",
    "taylor @xcite conducted an investigation on asymmetric wave propagation in wavy sheets with the main objective of deriving some information regarding the mechanical interaction between spermatozoa . in order to study some fluid dynamical aspect of the problem of peristaltic transport in an asymmetric channel under stokes flow conditions , the boundary integral method along with a suitable numerical technique",

    "bile ( alternatively called as gall ) is a greenish yellow secretion that contains various biochemical substances like bile acids , bile salts , pigments , cholesterol , phospholipids and electrolytic chemicals .",
    "bile is produced in the liver . in adult humans ,",
    "the quantity produced in a day is about one litre . after passing through several bile ducts , which penetrate the liver ,",
    "bile flows into to the the common bile duct .",
    "it helps accelerate the fat absorption process and there by plays an important role in absorbing the vitamins d , e , k and a that are soluble in fat .",
    "it has been suggested by recent physiological researchers ( cf .",
    "vries et al.@xcite ) that uterine peristalsis resulting from myometrial contraction can take place in both symmetric and asymmetric directions .",
    "various investigators have carried out different studies pertaining to the gastrointestinal tract , intra - pleural membranes , capillary walls , human lung , bile duct , gall bladder with stones and small blood vessels , as well as flow in porous tubes and deformable porous layers .",

    "@xcite reported that an impulsive magnetic field can be used as a theraptic means to treat patients who have stone fragments in their urinary tract .",

    "this system contains the liver , gallbladder and biliary tract namely cystic , hepatic and common bile ducts .",
    "although several analytical and physiological aspects of the human biliary system have been analyzed elaborately , we have only insufficient information about the mechanism of bile flow in the system .",

    "incidence of the gallstone disease indicates considerable geographical and regional variations @xcite .",
    "lauga and stone @xcite made an experimental attempt to evaluate the effective slip length of the resulting flow as a function of the degrees of freedom describing the surface heterogeneities , namely the relative width of the no - slip and no - shear stress regions and their distribution along the pipe .",
    "they gave a possible interpretation of the experimental results which is consistent with a large number of distributed slip domains such as nano - size and micron - size nearly flat bubbles coating the solid surface .",
