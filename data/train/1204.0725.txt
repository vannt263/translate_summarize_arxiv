    "star clusters are often considered as building blocks of galaxies . understanding how these objects form and evolve is vital to our comprehension of the structure , formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "for instance , the open cluster ( oc ) system has been used to analyse the structure , dynamics , composition , and evolution of the galactic disk @xcite .",

    ". in practical terms , astrophysical parameters can in fact be determined for an oc more easily than for a single star .

    "it is accepted that at this stage , the fate of a cluster is determined by the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and the mass of the more massive stars .",
    "if the ec blows out the gas adiabatically , the cluster will remain bound as long as the sfe is higher than @xmath2 , but if the gas expulsion is explosive , the sfe needs to be higher than @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gas expulsion can be very disruptive and because of this @xmath4 of the ecs do not survive to become ocs @xcite , with the survivors keeping at most @xmath3 of their stars ( _ infant weight loss _ - * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite argue that the variation in cluster initial conditions is the most important parameter for dissolution by gas expulsion .",
    "this occurs because the stellar distribution can change significantly , changing the relative importance of the stellar and gas potentials .",
    "star formation occurs inside massive and dense gas clumps in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "these structures contain many cores that form stars .",
    "some cores can group themselves in small sub - clumps where the sfe can be higher than in the overall clump .",
    "this way , @xcite suggest that the determinant factor for cluster survival is the virial state of the stellar content immediately before the gas expulsion . in this context , both _ infant mortality _ and cluster infant stellar loss depend on the radial density profile ( rdp ) just before the gas expulsion @xcite and the relative distribution of stars and gas @xcite .",

    "due to the relatively large distance of the ocs and 2mass photometry limitations , we do not have access to the whole stellar mass range of these clusters . therefore , for the old oc fsr 893 we use kroupa s ( 2001 ) mass function to estimate the total stellar mass , down to the h - burning mass limit ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the estimated mass is shown in table  [ mass2 ] .    for ms stars in young clusters we simply count stars in the cmds ( within the region @xmath6 ) , and sum their masses as estimated from the mass - luminosity relation implied by the respective isochrone solution ( sect .",
    "[ sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , we count the number of pms stars and multiply by an average mass value adopted for these stars to estimate the mass within the pms . assuming that the mass distribution of the pms stars also follows kroupa s ( 2001 ) mf",
    ", the average pms mass - for masses within the range @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "the estimated mass ( table  [ tab8 ] ) should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "the early ec s structure reflects the underlying fractal structure in the dense molecular gas in which they are formed @xcite , but the dynamical evolution may erase this shape leading these objects to a smooth structure .",
    "previous works suggest that ecs are not virialised and , as a consequence , are sub - structured with a rdp presenting bumps and dips comparable to the field fluctuation . because of this , they can not be fitted by king s profile that describes the structure of clusters close to spherical symmetry and centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "however , after the gas expulsion , surviving ocs are probably not virialised , so the bumps and dips may be the result of a non relaxed cluster before the gas expulsion , or a consequence of the gas expulsion .",
    "an additional explanation is the presence of other clusters in the neighbourhood .",
    "objects like stock 8 , fsr 780 , cbb 3 , and neighbours ( fig .",
    "[ rdp2 ] ) are possibly examples of out - of - equilibrium star clusters . in addition , the presence of other objects creates bumps in the rdp ( fig .",
    "[ rdp2 ] ) . therefore",
    ", their structural parameters can not be derived by a king law , but it does not mean that the rdp does not provide information on the cluster structure .",
    "for example , it can be useful to differentiate physical systems from field fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the cmd morphology may provide clues to their nature @xcite .",
    "however , deeper observations of the less - populated clusters with irregular rdps could solve this problem by checking if the irregularities are intrinsic to the cluster structure or result from the photometric constraints .",

    "for clusters with age @xmath13 myr the disk frequency in intermediate mass stars is often higher than for low mass stars @xcite .",

    "@xcite estimated for ic 417 a kinematic distance of @xmath22 kpc .",

    "we suggest that bpi 14 @xcite is associated with ic 417 supporting @xcite results .",

    "the stellar density distribution in aur ob2 shows small peaks coinciding mainly with massive stars ( fig .",
    "the formation of massive stars in early cluster phases may destroy them , because winds blow out gas and dust .",
    "however , as most massive stars form in clusters @xcite the occurrence of isolated ones may be related to the infant mortality rate .",
    "it is possible that massive star formation within an ob association occurs in _ clumps _ that merge forming massive clusters , or disrupt them becoming field ob stars .",
    "recent works suggest that stars may be formed in low density stellar groups ( ldsgs ) that disperse in the field without requiring gas expulsion @xcite .",
    "ldsgs are generally distributed along filamentary structures of gas and dust @xcite .",
    "filamentary structures are sites of turbulent gas motion , which seems to favour the formation of individual stars or ldsgs , with turbulence enhancing gas densities , and decreasing the jeans mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that only @xmath26 of the ysos near the sun are located in ecs .",
    "this scenario explains probable young stars outside clusters , and the continuous distribution of ysos between stock 8 and bpi 14 , supporting sequential star formation ( fig .",
    "[ ic ] ) .",
    "the stellar distribution in aur ob2 suggests that formation in clustered environments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and similar works ) and in ldsgs may be part of a global scenario , where star formation occurs in groups with a continuous range of stellar densities depending on the natal gas density , with dense _",

    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "ecs with the gas centrally concentrated are more dependent on the sfe than sub - structured ones , which are less affected by gas expulsion .",
    "ldsgs probably result unbound , or merge forming a cluster .",
    "the latter is a way to form clusters in low density molecular gas and contributes to explain the low sfe in gmcs .",
    "these groups may contribute to forming associations of clusters , since filamentary structures are often found near ecs .",
    "nevertheless , these stars might be ejected from the clusters by dynamical effects ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) .",
    "sequential star formation is also possible for fsr 777 , kronberger 1 , and cbb 7 . in this scenario",
    "the star formation might have been triggered by massive stars in fsr 777 and the o star below kronberger 1 ( fig .",
    "@xcite estimated for kronberger 1 a distance from the sun of 1.9 kpc and age of @xmath27 myr , but we argue , based on the very young age indicators ( table  [ tab7 ] ) and cmd ( fig .
