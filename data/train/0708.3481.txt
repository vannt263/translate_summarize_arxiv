    "quantum algorithms such as shor s factoring algorithm @xcite and grover s search algorithm @xcite exemplify the potential speedup offered by quantum computers .",
    "although the origin of this speed - up is not fully understood , there are indications that quantum entanglement plays a crucial role @xcite",
    ". therefore , it is of interest to quantify the entanglement of the quantum states of multiple qubits that appear in quantum algorithms , using suitable measures .",
    "the special case of bipartite entanglement has been studied extensively in recent years and was established as a resource for quantum teleportation .",
    "the entanglement of pure bipartite states is completely determined by their schmidt coefficients .",
    "thus , any measure of bipartite entanglement must be a function of these coefficients .",
    "for example , the von neumann entropy is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , which are the squares of the schmidt coefficients .",
    "for mixed bipartite states , several measures were proposed , namely the entanglement of formation and the entanglement of distillation @xcite . in particular , for states of two qubits an exact formula for the entanglement of formation was obtained @xcite .",
    "the more general case of multipartite entanglement , in a register of @xmath0 qubits , is not as well understood , partly because no analogue of the schmidt decomposition was found for multipartite systems .",
    "axiomatic considerations have provided a set of properties that entanglement measures should satisfy @xcite .",
    "these properties include the requirement that any entanglement measure should vanish for product ( or separable ) states ; it should be invariant under local unitary operations and should not increase as a result of any sequence of local operations complemented by only classical communication between the parties .",
    "quantities that satisfy these properties are called entanglement monotones .",
    "these properties provide useful guidelines in the search for entanglement measures for multipartite quantum states .",
    "entanglement measures based on metric properties of the hilbert space @xcite and on polynomial invariants @xcite were proposed and shown to satisfy these requirements .",
    "although some measures have been studied extensively , the connection between such measures and the efficiency of quantum algorithms remains unclear .",
    "the common framework of quantum computation is based on a universal set of one and two qubit gates @xcite .",
    "repeated operations of these gates enable to obtain any desired quantum state of the register . to generate multipartite entanglement encompassing all the qubits in a register",
    ", one applies a series of two qubit gates between pairs of qubits , in addition to single qubit gates .",
    "one can visualize this process as a network , in which the qubits are represented by nodes and two qubit operations are represented by edges that connect the corresponding nodes .",
    "quantum entanglement is transitive in the sense that if we apply a gate that entangles qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 and then a gate that entangles qubits @xmath2 and @xmath3 , this typically also gives rise to entanglement between qubits @xmath1 and @xmath3 . by entanglement between qubits @xmath1 and @xmath3 we mean that any two parties , each including one of these qubits , can not be in a product state with each other .",
    "thus , in order for the entanglement to encompass all the qubits in the register , the nodes associated with any pair of qubits must be connected , either directly or indirectly .",
    "in recent years , several possible implementations of quantum computers have been proposed . in some of these schemes the interactions between qubits",
    "are non - local in the sense that two - qubit gates may apply between any pair of qubits .",
    "other schemes are based on a rigid geometry in which only nearest neighbor qubits may interact . in particular , they may be arranged in a one dimensional chain , as in solid state quantum computers using quantum dots @xcite . in a one - dimensional geometry , two qubit gates may apply on only @xmath4 or @xmath5 pairs of qubits ( depending on the boundary conditions ) , out of the @xmath6 possible pairs .",
    "it is interesting to examine to what extent the geometrical restriction reduces the efficiency of the quantum computer .",
    "this limitation was addressed in the context of certain quantum algorithms @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the rate of formation of multipartite entanglement in a register of @xmath5 qubits by repeated operations of one and two - qubit gates .",
    "starting from a product state , we repeatedly apply a combination of random single qubit rotations and a fixed two - qubit gate on pairs of qubits .",
    "two geometries are considered : a non - local geometry in which any pair of qubits may interact with each other and a one dimensional chain , in which two qubit gates may apply only between nearest neighbor qubits .",
    "the resulting entanglement is evaluated using two measures : the average bipartite entanglement @xcite and the groverian measure @xcite .",
    "it is found that the non - local scheme is more effective , namely it requires fewer steps to produce a certain level of multipartite entanglement compared to the local scheme .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the entanglement measures used in this paper are briefly presented in sec .",
    "ii . the entanglement generating schemes , with local and non - local geometries are shown in sec .",
    "the simulations and results are presented in sec .",
    "iv , followed by a discussion in sec . v and a summary in sec .",
    "consider a quantum register of @xmath5 qubits in a pure state @xmath7 . the bipartite entanglement between a given qubit and all the other qubits is given by a single parameter @xcite , namely , all the entanglement monotones for such partition are the same up to a monotonic function",
    ". one of these monotones is the largest eigenvalue @xmath8 of the reduced density matrix , @xmath9 , of the single qubit .",
    "this eigenvalue is also the square of the largest schmidt coefficient .",
    "another monotone is @xmath10 , which is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath8 in the relevant interval @xmath11 . to evaluate the entanglement in a register of @xmath5",
    "qubits we average this measure over all @xmath5 choices of the single qubit , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the reduced density matrix of the @xmath1th qubit , obtained by taking a partial trace over all the other qubits . after a suitable normalization and shift ,",
    "one obtains the entanglement measure @xcite    @xmath14    this measure was used in order to evaluate the entanglement generated by repeated operations of random gates @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 is an entanglement monotone only for the most refined partition , where each qubit is considered as a separate party .",
    "it is thus commonly considered as a measure of multipartite entanglement .",
    "in fact , the measure @xmath15 essentially quantifies bipartite entanglement , which is averaged over @xmath5 different partitions . in each partition , one party consists of a single qubit while the other party consists of @xmath4 qubits .",
    "one may define other partitions of the register into two parties , where one party includes @xmath3 qubits and the other party includes @xmath16 qubits . for a given value of @xmath3 ,",
    "the entanglement measure is obtained by averaging tr@xmath17 over all possible partitions of this type . in a more general framework",
    ", the register can be partitioned into any number of parties between 2 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "grover s algorithm performs a search for a marked element @xmath18 in a search space @xmath19 containing @xmath20 elements @xcite .",
    "we assume , for convenience , that @xmath21 , where @xmath5 is an integer .",
    "this way , the elements of @xmath19 can be represented by an @xmath5-qubit register @xmath22 , with the computational basis states @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the meaning of marking the element @xmath18 , is that there is a function @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 for the marked element , and @xmath27 for the rest . to solve this search problem on a classical computer one",
    "needs to evaluate @xmath28 for each element , one by one , until the marked state is found . in the worst case , this requires @xmath20 evaluations of @xmath28 . on a quantum computer , where @xmath28 can be evaluated _ coherently _ , grover s algorithm , represented by the unitary operator @xmath29 , can locate a marked element using only @xmath30 coherent queries of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is based on quantum oracle , with the ability to recognize the marked states @xcite . starting with the equal superposition state ,    @xmath31    and applying the operator @xmath29 , one obtains the state @xmath32 , which is then measured .",
    "the success probability of the algorithm is almost unity .",
    "the adjoint equation takes the form @xmath33 .",
    "if an arbitrary pure state , @xmath34 , is used as the initial state instead of the state @xmath35 , the success probability is reduced to @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "the success probability is thus determined by the fidelity , between @xmath7 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "consider grover s search algorithm , in which an arbitrary pure state @xmath7 is used as the initial state . before applying the operator @xmath29",
    ", there is a pre - processing stage in which arbitrary local unitary operators @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are applied on the @xmath5 qubits in the register .",
    "these operators are chosen such that the success probability of the algorithm will be maximized .",
    "the maximal success probability is thus given by    @xmath42    which can be re - written as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the space of all tensor product states of the form @xmath45 .",
    "the groverian measure is given by @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "in the case of pure states , for which @xmath47 is defined , it is closely related to the entanglement measure introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite for both pure and mixed states and was shown to be an entanglement monotone . based on these results , it was shown @xcite that : @xmath48 , with equality when @xmath34 is a product state ; @xmath47 is invariant under local unitary operations and can not be increased using local operations and classical communication .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 is an entanglement monotone for pure states .",
    "a related result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the evolution of the quantum state during the iteration of grover s algorithm corresponds to the shortest path in the hilbert space using a suitable metric .",
    "the groverian measure was used in order to evaluate the entanglement generated by quantum algorithms such as grover s algorithm @xcite and shor s algorithm @xcite .",
    "it was also generalized to the case of mixed states @xcite and to arbitrary partitions of the register @xcite .",
    "here we use a different version of the groverian measure , referred to as the logarithmic groverian measure , given by    @xmath49    this is an entanglement monotone , because the logarithmic function is monotonically increasing , and it vanishes for product states , for which @xmath50 . unlike the measure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is restricted to the range of @xmath51 , the logarithmic groverian measure may take values in the range @xmath52 .",
    "this enables to better distinguish and compare between highly entangled states which involve a large number of qubits .",
    "furthermore , the logarithmic groverian measure exhibits the additivity property described below .",
    "consider the state @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are pure states of two different registers , of @xmath56 and @xmath57 qubits , respectively , and @xmath58 .",
    "one can express the product state @xmath59 of @xmath5 qubits in the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are product states of @xmath56 and @xmath57 qubits , respectively . since @xmath7 is a tensor product of @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ", we obtain that @xmath63 .",
    "thus , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax ] ) we find that @xmath64 . as a result ,",
    "the logarithmic groverian measure satisfies    @xmath65    the additivity enables to compare between the entanglement in registers which include different numbers of qubits .",
    "to examine the rate of multipartite entanglement formation in quantum circuits we consider a scheme for the production of pseudo - random states of @xmath5 qubits @xcite .",
    "the number of random amplitudes in a random state of @xmath5 qubits is exponential in @xmath5 .",
    "while the randomization of the state of each qubit alone requires only linear resources , the formation of entanglement between them is more costly .",
    "nevertheless , it can be achieved by a combination of random single qubit gates and a fixed two - qubit gate , which apply repeatedly on pairs of qubits .",
    "it was shown that this _ rotate - entangle - rotate _ scheme provides pseudo - random states with only polynomial resources @xcite .",
    "the random single qubit rotation is obtained using    @xmath66    where at each step @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are drawn from a uniform distribution over the unit interval @xmath51 .",
    "this parametrization provides operators drawn uniformly from the haar measure @xcite .",
    "for the two - qubit gate , we use the controlled - phase gate @xcite    @xmath70    expressed in the canonical decomposition form given in ref .",
    "this is a sensible choice because this operator can produce maximally entangled states .",
    "the initial state of the entanglement generating scheme is a random product state , @xmath71 , of @xmath5-qubits , where the state of each qubit is drawn from a uniform distribution on the bloch sphere .",

    "these three functions strongly fluctuate when evaluated for a single run of the entanglement generating scheme .",
    "to reduce the noise and elucidate the systematic trends , we perform a large number of runs using different initial states @xmath82 and calculate the averages @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 vs. @xmath72 .     vs. time in the local scheme ( a ) and in the non - local scheme ( b ) .",

    "the sharp increase of @xmath83 is explained by the fact that the fidelity is highly sensitive not only to two - qubit operations but also to single - qubit operations .",
    "hence , the first few steps of the scheme can decrease the fidelity substantially . to explain the overshoot , notice that product states have smaller fidelity with each other than entangled states , since the fidelity of two product states is simply the multiplication of the fidelities of the tensor components ( all smaller then 1 ) .",
