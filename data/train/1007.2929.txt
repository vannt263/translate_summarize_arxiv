    "the big bang singularity ( bbs ) is a notorious problem that present in standard big bang theory as well as inflation theory @xcite .",
    "people have made a lot of efforts in solving this problem , and lots of mechanisms have been carried out , among which there are scenarios from string theory , quantum gravity theory and so on . either reduced from these theories , or directly arisen from the effective field theory , we are able to obtain a bounce solution in 4-dimensional space - time . bouncing cosmologies , especially non - singular ones , has gained more and more development in many aspects @xcite . as an alternative of the standard theory in the early universe , it can not only avoid bbs , but also gives well favored observational effects compared to the astronomical data , such as scale invariant power spectrum and suppression of cmb low quardrupole on large scales @xcite . besides , a scenario of bouncing cosmology can give rise to large nongaussianities @xcite .",
    "if we take our universe to be flat , thus within the framework of einstein s general relativity in 4 dimensional space - time , a bounce is usually realized by quintom matter @xcite . as has been briefly proved in @xcite , in order for a bounce to happen , where the scale factor of the universe contracted to some value and then expanded , the hubble parameter has to evolve from a negative value to a positive one .",
    "it will cause the equation of state of the universe will be less than @xmath0 , violating the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "generally , some phantom part will get involved that makes the physics unclear @xcite .",
    "however , this dilemma can be ameliorated in many ways , such as to introduce non - scalar fields , or higher derivative operators and so on .",
    "one of the simplest ways is to go with the help of non - minimal coupling to gravity @xcite . in quantum gravity in curved space - time",
    ", it is argued that the existence of the non - minimal coupling term is required by the quantum corrections and renormalization @xcite .",
    "this coupling includes scalar - tensor theories where the ricci scalar couples to the field through the term @xmath1 @xcite ( as will be called `` linear coupling '' for convenience ) , which contains brans - dicke theory @xcite or dilaton theory @xcite , see @xcite for a comprehensive review . since the inclusion of non - minimal coupling term can drive cosmic acceleration with a wider class of potential than usually considered , it can also be utilized as inflaton in the early time @xcite and dark energy at current epoch @xcite . with the help of the non - minimal coupling , a single scalar field can also behave like systems of multi - degree - of - freedom without really involving a ghost field , such as having its equation of state ( eos ) cross the cosmological constant boundary as a  quintom \" matter @xcite .",
    "moreover , a great deal of non - minimal coupling theories can find their equivalence to the modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the possibility of realizing bouncing scenario with a single scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "we find that generally speaking , it does work as expected , except that for some specific case where gravity couples linearly , some constraints have to be imposed on the field action .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we shortly demonstrate the general case for a non - minimal coupling field to drive a bounce , in section iii and iv we investigate the linear coupling case and non - linear coupling case respectively , while conclusions come in the last section .",
    "to begin with , let us consider the most general action containing one scalar field and gravity , of which the two components are coupled in a very general form : s = d^4x\\{+p(x , ) }  , where @xmath2 and the metric used here is @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the kinetic term of the field : @xmath5 .",
    "what we re working throughout this note is under jordan frame . by variation of the action",
    "we can easily obtain the friedmann equations : [ fe1 ] --^2p(x,)+^2p_x+3(+h^2)f_r-3h&=&0  , + [ fe2 ] + ^2p(x,)-f_r(+3h^2)++2h&=&0  , where @xmath6 , and the equation of motion for the field @xmath7 is : [ eom ] -p_x - p_xx_x^-p_x_^+p_+=0  .where @xmath8 and similarly @xmath9 is the derivative of @xmath10 with respect to the field @xmath7 .    as mentioned before , for a flat universe with standard einstein gravity in 4-dimensional space - time",
    ", a bounce happens only when the null energy condition ( nec ) is violated .",
    "we can learn from einstein equations that this leads to the vanishing of hubble parameter @xmath11 with a positive time derivative , namely @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the bounce point @xcite .",
    "substituting the first condition to the above equations one gets : & & 3f_r+^2(+3p)+f=0  , + & & h=>0  .    in following sections",
    ", we will analyze in detail the application of these conditions to the non - minimal coupling scalar field . before starting",
    ", we would like to classify the coupling term into two categories according to its properties : one is a more specific case that the gravity couples linearly to the field , and the other is a more general case which refers to non - linear coupling .",
    "actually , these two categories are very different due to the different numbers of degree of freedom in the background equations . due to this reason",
    ", it may cause very different conclusions .",
    "among the various possible forms the coupling terms may have , it is the simplest to study the one that ricci scalar couples linearly to the field , which is easy to get a renormalizable theory without any suppression .",
    "moreover , as differ from its non - linear counterpart , in this case the higher order derivative of @xmath14 is zero , thus higher order time derivatives of @xmath11 will not get involved into the background equations . to study the general solution of this case ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath15 , where the first term in the bracket denotes the standard term from general relativity , and the second comes from the non - minimal coupling . from eqs .",
    "( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) , one can get : -+^2 + 3(1-f())&=&0  , + + ^2p(x,)-(1-f())&=&0  , which can be furtherly simplified to a very neat form : -3h^2(1-f)+^2 + 3h&=&0  , + 2 ^ 2xp_x+2(1-f())-2xf_-f_&=&0  .in deriving these equations , we have made use of the fact @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the last one of the above equations gives =  .for @xmath12 , we have & = & 0  , + & = & -^2  .in deriving the last equation we also made use of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) .",
    "we can see from above that for case of gravity coupling linearly to scalar field , a bounce requires the rhs of the above equation to be larger than 0 as well as the energy density equals to 0 .",
    "this can be viewed as a general condition for this case .",
    "at first let us consider the simplest case in which the field has a standard canonical form : [ canonical ] p(x,)=_^-v ( )  , where @xmath18 is its potential .",
    "thus the energy density of the field @xmath19 .",
    "the condition of @xmath20 requires that at the bounce point @xmath21 , or equivalently @xmath22 . it can be straightforwardly seen that as long as @xmath23 at this point , one needs @xmath24 , namely , a potential containing negative values at least at some region is required , while a positive - definite potential as usual does nt work . but",
    "is that the case even for the possible case where @xmath25 , though it refers to a very specific point in @xmath26 space and needs strong fine - tuning ? to see this , let s take a look at the other condition of @xmath27 , which then indicates : < 0",
    ".where we used @xmath28 as well as @xmath29 . from this equation",
    "we notice that @xmath30 can be either larger or less than 0 , depending on the form of @xmath31 .",
    "for example , if we assume that @xmath32 , then the condition is @xmath33 .",
    "but anyway , as long as @xmath34 at the bouncing point where @xmath35 , there will inevitably be some region where @xmath24 .",
    "so this will be a generic constraint on the potential of the field . in usual case",
    ", this will break down the positive - definition of the energy density , which causes unphysics . however , here it is fine both because of the positive kinetic term and the effects of gravity .",
    "thus , after some proper choice of parameters , we can still get a self - consistent system .    as a further study , we also derived the second derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath36 at the bouncing point .",
    "it appears to be : h&=&\\{[2 ^ 2(1-f)+3f_^2 ] [ ^2(-2 ^ 2 - 4f_-4hf_-4h^2f _ + & & -v_f_-v_f_+f_^3 + 2f _ ) -12hf_^2 - 12h^2f_f _ ] + & & + ( 2 ^ 2f_-6f_f_)[^2(-^2 ^ 2 - 4hf _ -v_f_+f_^2)-6h^2f_^2 ] }  .it can be straightforwardly read off that for the @xmath25 case ( note that @xmath12 ) , @xmath37 will vanish at the bouncing point .",
    "this means that in this case , the velocity of hubble parameter always reaches its extreme value when passing through the bouncing pivot .",
    "this is a new property that hasnt been pointed out by other authors in the literature .    in order to support our analytical calculation",
    ", we also try to find some regions in parameter space which can give good numerical results . in order to satisfy the constraints on the potential",
    ", we take into account two forms of potentials : 1 ) @xmath38 and 2 ) @xmath39 .",
    "we add some negative zero - point energy to the potential to let it get some negative region . for the coupling term",
    ", we choose @xmath32 , where @xmath40 is some coupling constant . in figs .",
    "[ linear1 ] and [ linear2 ] we show some numerical calculations on hubble parameter @xmath11 and scale factor @xmath41 .",
    "we can see that a bounce can happen naturally with @xmath11 crosses the zero divide line .",
    "this indicates that by this way , the big bang singularity can be avoided .",
    "and the coupling term is @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter is chosen to be @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the initial conditions are @xmath46 , @xmath47 . ]     and the coupling term is @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter is chosen to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the initial conditions are @xmath51 , @xmath52 . ]      beside canonical ones , there is another form of scalar field that is very common used in cosmology : the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) form .",
    "actions of this form effectively describes tachyon dynamics , which can be obtained naturally in string theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can also drive the acceleration of the universe and can act as inflaton @xcite and dark energy @xcite .",
    "as inflationary models inspired by the string theory , the dbi action non - minimally coupled to gravity has also been investigated in the literature , cf .",
    "ref . @xcite . here",
    "we study the last case to see whether it can avoid the big - bang singularity .",
    "the dbi lagrangian containing non - minimal coupling term is : [ dbi ] p(x,)=-v ( )  , where @xmath53 is some positive constant .",
    "its energy density can be calculated as @xmath54 .",
    "one can also obtain its equation of state and sound speed square by their definitions : w=2x-1  ,  c_s^2=  , which shows that this kind of action is stable under classical perturbations @xmath55 with quintessence - like behavior ( @xmath56 ) .    from ( [ dbi ] )",
    "we obtain the equation of motion for the scalar field : ----v_-=0  , where we get : = -and the friedmann equation : & & 3h^2(1-f())=^2 + 3hf _  , + & & =",
    ".    from above we can see that the first condition at the bounce point @xmath20 only requires @xmath57 , which is looser than that of the canonical scalar field case .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 is still required by the second condition @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , in order to have a bounce , a region of negative value of @xmath18 is also inevitable .",
    "we also make the numerical calculations , with the potential of the form @xmath39 and some proper parameter choice .",
    "the bounce happens naturally from the view of the plots . as a side remark",
    ", one may notice that due to different initial conditions , the model may present various behaviors . from fig .",
    "( [ dbi3 ] ) we can see that , the hubble parameter varies very fast after the bounce , from increasing to decreasing , indicating that the universe will enter into a moderate accelerating or decelerating expansion phase soon . while from fig .",
    "( [ dbi2 ] ) , one may note that the hubble parameter experienced a period of slow variation .",
    "this indicates that it is also possible to give rise to an inflationary period after bounce , although we will not discuss in detail as it goes beyond current topic .",
    "and the coupling term is @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter is chosen to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 , and the initial conditions are @xmath61 , @xmath62 . ]     and the coupling term is @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter is chosen to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 , and the initial conditions are @xmath63 , @xmath64 . ]",
    "as a comparison , in this section , we will focus on a more general case where , in the coupling term , gravity possesses a non - linear form .",
    "the most general form of basic equations comes from eq .",
    "( [ fe1]-[eom ] ) , however , for the sake of simplicity , we only discuss about the canonical field ( [ canonical ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can derive the friedmann equations and the equation of motion explicitly : h&=&[(rf_r - f)/2 - 3hf_r+^2(+v())-3f_rh^2]-4hh  , + h&=&[h(f_rrr+f_r)-2f_rh-^2 ^ 2-f_rrrr^2 - 2f_rrr - f_r^2-f_r]-4hh-4h^2  , where + 3h+v_-=0  .",
    "since the non - linear term of gravity has been involved , the higher order derivatives of @xmath11 appears in the equation , which makes the equations difficult to solve analytically .",
    "but as the order of derivative increases , the number of effective degrees of freedom becomes more , and it will be easier to violate nec and realize the bouncing process .    figs .",
    "[ log3 ] and [ log4 ] show that a canonical field with coupling term contains logarithm function of @xmath14 .",
    "the logarithm coupling may seem strange , however , one can find the similar form in previous phenomenological studies , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we can see from the plot that with proper choice of parameter , this kind of coupling may also give rise to a bounce scenario .",
    "[ exp2 ] is the plot of universe behavior for the coupling of @xmath65 to some exponential potential of @xmath7 .",
    "this kind of potential looks like the dilaton potential in string theory @xcite . with this kind of coupling",
    ", the universe can also pass through the bouncing point smoothly .     and",
    "the coupling term is chosen as @xmath66 .",
    "the parameter is chosen to be @xmath67 , @xmath50 and @xmath68 , and the initial conditions are @xmath69 , @xmath70 . ]     and the coupling term is chosen as @xmath66 . the parameter is chosen to be @xmath67 , @xmath50 and @xmath68 , and the initial conditions are @xmath63 , @xmath71 . ]     and the coupling term is chosen as @xmath72 . the parameter is chosen to be @xmath43 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and the initial conditions are @xmath75 , @xmath76 . ]",
    "in this note we investigated the possibilities of a single scalar field giving rise to a bouncing scenario in the very early universe , with some non - minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "along with some explicit examples , we showed that it is quite possible .",
    "however , for the common case that gravity couples linearly to the field , the field will suffer from some severe conditions , such as abandoning the positive - definition of the potential .",
    "for other cases where gravity couples non - linearly , it will be more free to get a bounce since more degrees of freedom have been evoked .",
    "the realization of bounce with non - minimal coupling field is important in the sense that , with the involvement of gravity , one no longer needs any ghost field to violate nec , which might cause problems .",
    "recently there have been many works on construction of bouncing cosmologies within the framework of non - minimal coupling theories , which have some relation to our work while focus more on their fundamental origins @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that with proper choice of the coupling form , it is also possible to obtain right amount of observational signatures to meet the data , and to give rise to some new features and predictions for future experiments , for example , a recent work shows that the matter bounce scenario with non - minimal coupling will give rise to scale - invariant spectrum and large particle productions @xcite .",
