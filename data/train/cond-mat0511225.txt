    "in recent years substantial efforts have been invested in miniaturizing chemical processes by building microfluidic systems . the `` lab on a chip '' concept integrates a great variety of chemical and physical processes into a single device @xcite in a similar way as an integrated circuit incorporates many electronic devices into a single chip .",
    "these microfluidic devices do not only allow for cheap mass production but they can operate with much smaller quantities of reactants and reaction products than standard laboratory equipments .",
    "even though most available microfluidic devices today have micron sized channels , further miniaturization is leading towards the nano - scale .",
    "there are two main lines of development for microfluidic systems .",
    "the first one encompasses systems with closed channels , essentially microfabricated tubes . however , closed channel systems have the disadvantage that they can be easily clogged by solute particles such as colloids or large bio - polymers .",
    "the second type consists of systems which are open with a free liquid - vapor interface , where the fluid is confined laterally not by geometrical but by chemical walls .",
    "the idea is that the liquid will be guided by lyophilic stripes on an otherwise lyophobic substrate @xcite .",
    "the substrate surfaces can be structured chemically by printing or photographic techniques .",
    "all these techniques are confined to two dimensions .    while liquid flow in closed channel systems can be pumped by applying a pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet",
    ", the liquid - vapor interface of an open system would yield to the pressure ( like a very soft rubber tube ) and droplets would form .",
    "furthermore , upon pumping flow directions in interconnected open channel systems would be difficult to predict because small droplets may or may not inflate into larger ones , depending on details of the channel geometry and the filling state . however , there are a number of alternative ways to drive a liquid through a chemical channel .",
    "the most obvious one is to use inertia to drive the flow , e.g. , centrifugal forces or gravity , as occurs when a liquid film flows down an inclined plane . for films with thicknesses in the nanometer range",
    "one needs stronger accelerations in order to achieve a decent throughput .",
    "these can be realized most conveniently on a rotating disc ( e.g. , a spin coater or a centrifuge ) .",
    "electric forces are also commonly used in order to drive flows in small channels , e.g. , by using the electro - osmotic effect which , however , only works for liquids containing ions .",
    "since water is the most interesting liquid for biological applications , this is not a serious restriction . depending on the wall potential ,",
    "a charged layer a few  in thickness forms and an electric field applied parallel to the substrate will set the liquid in this layer in motion .",
    "while the electro - osmotic effect drives the liquid molecules at the substrate , the marangoni effect drives the molecules at the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "the origin of the marangoni forces are gradients in surface tension which arise from temperature gradients or from gradients in surfactant concentrations .",
    "the fourth method to cause flow in a chemical channel is wicking , i.e. , the sucking of a droplet into a chemical channel by capillary forces .    here",
    "we consider inertial driving of the liquid , which is one of the most promising methods to generate flow in open microfluidic devices .",
    "marangoni forces could be induced easily by local heating of the liquid , but for volatile fluids like water this will lead to enhanced and undesirable evaporation .",
    "wicking is slow for longer channels and ceases to act as a driving force once the channel is filled . in principle , electrical forcing has the advantage that the direction of the force can be controlled on very small scales , but the required fields are high and might lead to electrolysis .",
    "in contrast , inertial driving can be realized easily by centrifugal forces and does not affect the liquid sample .",
    "our focus in this paper is the stability and robustness of one - dimensional channel flow ( i.e. , flow in a straight channel ) with inertial forcing aligned with the channel direction .",

    "the liquid is often driven off the substrate .    in order to relate the md simulation results to macroscopic hydrodynamics , we consider the special case in which the liquid occupies just half of a cylinder with a 90@xmath0 contact angle , with initial height @xmath54 . as discussed below in sects .",

( the explicit analytic form of the shear stress can be obtained from the formulas in sec .",
    "[ sec : stab ] and the md counterpart is the irving - kirkwood expression @xcite . ) in order to obtain these fields from the simulations , the flow domain in the @xmath42-@xmath43 plane was divided into square bins of size @xmath46 , and the appropriate quantity in each bin was averaged both over time ( @xmath55 ) and the length of the system in @xmath2-direction ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "a larger averaging time interval was impractical due to the eventual development of systematic interfacial fluctuations , while smaller sampling bins lead to excessive noise in the stress ( and wall - induced oscillations in the liquid density near the solid @xcite ) .",
    "the jaggedness in the ns figures results from the relatively small number of bins ( @xmath57 ) occupied by the liquid , while that in the md figures incorporates thermal fluctuations as well .",
    "the first point to note is that the md liquid - vapor interface is rather diffuse , corresponding to a width of about 7 sampling bins .",
    "this feature is not easily accounted for in the ns calculation , so that close agreement should not be expected .",
    "secondly , we see that while the shear stress values are in qualitative agreement both in shape and magnitude and the velocity fields have the same shape , the velocity values differ by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "this comparison depends critically on the value chosen for the liquid ridge height in the ns calculations : a larger height increases the velocity values and decreases the stress , so that a different choice could make both agree to 50% . here , in computing the ns flow field , we selected the numerical value of the height @xmath36 based on the reasonable but arbitrary definition as the point where the md density dropped to half the value at the center of the ridge ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : wurst ] and [ fig : snap ] ) .",
    "the fact that the md velocities are larger may result from the fact the free surface region of the ridge exhibits a transition between liquid and gaseous phases and time - averaged velocities in the latter are larger . in any case , the degree of agreement between md and ns hydrodynamics is worse than in similar comparisons where the liquid is completely confined by walls @xcite , which we attribute to the diffuse top boundary of the liquid .",
    "a final remark is that the ( thermal ) fluctuations in the md results are largest for the stress , moderate for the velocity , and almost invisible in the density .",
    "the reason is that the stress computation involves the intermolecular force , which is a rapidly varying function of atomic separation , while the velocities result from an integration over the force , which provides some smoothing .",
    "the density follows from the atomic positions , which are a further integral of the velocity , and is thus still smoother .",
    "turning now to the systematic study of pearling instabilities , we have conducted a number of simulations in which we explore the effects of several operating parameters . for a fixed number of liquid atoms ( 128,000 , or 32,000 molecules ) we vary    *",
    "filling : the number of liquid particles per stripe length on the wetting stripe . in practice , we choose different widths for the solid wetting stripe , and since the liquid is effectively pinned to the edges of the stripe , it adjusts its height and contact angle such that a circular cross section emerges . * wetting : the region exterior to the completely wetting stripe can be either completely non - wetting ( i.e. , drying ) or partially wetting . in the former case the liquid",

    "[ fig : flow_comp ] ) . as a result , it is difficult to identify from the simulations the individual modes of the stability analysis , and their growth rates can not be measured directly .",
    "the onset of the instability at contact angle @xmath68 as well as the wavelength of the instability are reasonably well predicted by a simple long - wavelength expansion of the stokes free boundary problem . within this approximation ,",
    "the only non - trivial part of the calculation is the numerical determination of the mobility ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lw ] ) .",
    "however , since the most unstable wavelength is of the order of the ridge diameter , only qualitative results can be expected .",
    "in contrast to the md results as well as to the full stability analysis , within this approximation the maximally unstable wavelength turns out to be independent of the acceleration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gr_real ] for the real part of the dispersion relation ) .",
    "the agreement between the md simulation results and hydrodynamics ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : flow_comp ] ) is less satisfactory than in other geometries without a free surface .",
    "the main reason seems to be the presence of thermal fluctuations of the liquid - vapor interface , i.e. , capillary wave - like excitations , which broaden the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "the incorporation of thermal fluctuations has proven successful in relating md simulations of a free liquid jet to the ns equations @xcite , and more recently , have been included in a hydrodynamic thin film model @xcite .",
    "an extension of this technique to liquid ridges with large contact angles in chemical channels might improve the agreement with the simulations .",
    "another possible source of disagreement between the md simulations and the ns results is the neglect of the disjoining pressure in the hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "the issue arises because large portions of _ thin _ liquid films are exposed to the long - ranged substrate potentials and to the absence of liquid molecules outside the films @xcite , and is expected to be important in the nanoscale flows studied here . in the simple case of a film of nearly constant thickness atop an infinite homogeneous substrate ,",
    "the effect of the disjoining pressure is captured by adding a contribution @xmath210 to the pressure , where @xmath211 is the hamaker constant , which is positive in a completely wetting case . if we repeat the long - wavelength analysis with this additional term added to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ laplacepress ] ) , the effect of the disjoining pressure is to modify the amplitude growth rate to @xmath212^{-1 }                                                           \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left\\{\\left[\\frac{2\\,(h_0 ^ 2/a^2 - 1)}{(h_0 ^ 2/a^2 + 1)^2 }        -\\frac{3a_h}{\\gamma a^2 }         \\left(\\frac{a}{h_0}\\right)^4\\right]\\,(k\\,a)^2-(k\\,a)^4\\right\\}~ ,                                                           \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the disjoining pressure has a stabilizing effect .",
    "it lowers the maximum growth rate and shifts the most unstable mode towards longer wavelength . in terms of the stability criterion , it leads to @xmath213^{1/2}$ ] instead of @xmath214 . for realistic values of @xmath211 @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath215 .",
    "such a difference will be masked by the uncertainties in md simulations due to thermal noise and is undetectable at the present level of accuracy of our results .",
    "this calculation is only approximate , since the geometry in this paper is rather more complicated than a nearly - uniform film on a homogeneous substrate .",
    "other authors have extended this disjoining pressure analysis to the wedge - shaped geometries arising in drop spreading @xcite , and to substrates with heterogeneous chemical patterns @xcite , but we feel that dealing with the other effects noted above is more pressing .",
    "note that the md simulations did not include a _",
    "long_-ranged disjoining pressure contribution per se , since the lj interaction is cut off .",
    "the reason is that in md simulations of flow at the 10 nm scale , the principal effect arises from the short - ranged interactions between liquid and solid atoms , and the long - ranged tail has a negligible effect ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for wetting _ transitions _ however , this tail is quite important @xcite . in particular on chemically structured surfaces ,",
    "the influence of the laterally inhomogeneous substrate potential on the wetting film thickness has been discussed in detail @xcite and on chemical stripes morphological phase transitions have been predicted @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have confirmed the theoretical predictions on the structure of wetting films on a chemical stripe @xcite .",
    "however , the thermodynamical ensemble plays a crucial role here .",
    "there are three types of ensembles which have to be distinguished due to their distinct characters . if the substrate is exposed to a large vapor reservoir one deals with a grand canonical ensemble as studied theoretically in refs .",
    "@xcite and experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a volatile liquid enclosed into an isolating container one has a canonical ensemble ; the md simulations presented here correspond to this case . for a completely non - volatile liquid the liquid volume in the ridge",
    "is strictly conserved ; this case has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and corresponds to the situation considered for the analytic hydrodynamic analyses in sects .",
    "[ sec : stab ] and [ sec : lw ] .",
    "the md simulations are well described by the non - volatile stokes dynamics , because the vapor pressure is very low and the vapor volume is small .",
    "instabilities , such as the pearling instability , can not be observed in a grand canonical setting ( in accordance with the experimental observations in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , because they only occur in situations in which the pressure in the liquid ridge decreases with increasing volume . in this case , in a grand canonical setting , however ,",
    "more and more molecules would be drawn out of the reservoir onto the ridge and it would grow without limit .",
    "interestingly , the authors of ref .  @xcite",
    "find that the disjoining pressure does not influence the ridge shape above a ridge height of approximately 8  nm .",
    "this finding corroborates our conjecture given above , that the influence of the substrate potential on the instability studied in the present paper is small .    in this work",
    "we have considered inertial driving , i.e. , a force acting on every liquid atom in the system independent of its distance from the substrate surface .",
    "although the physical mechanism for driving the liquid is qualitatively different , we expect electro - osmotically driven liquids to behave very similarly , in particular for low ion concentrations .",
    "if in such systems the debye layer thickness is on the order of the ridge diameter , the ions are almost homogeneously distributed inside the ridge and the electrical force acts equally everywhere .",
    "this is in contrast to macroscopic systems , where the debye layer is thin as compared to the system size and the electrical force only acts at the boundary of the system .    since the pearling instability increases the flow through a chemical channel ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vel ] ) , it might be an advantage to operate a microfluidic system in the unstable regime .",
    "moreover , since the initially formed pearls have a relatively narrow size distribution , a chemical channel could be used as a nano - droplet dispenser .",
    "for longitudinal driving , the liquid stays on the chemical stripe even at high accelerations and when the instability is fully developed . for applications the stability with respect to non - longitudinal driving as well as the behavior at junctions and bends will be important . full three - dimensional stokes flow simulations , possibly taking into account the effect of long - ranged interactions and thermal fluctuations , should be used in order to interpret the results of md simulations in such complicated geometries .",
