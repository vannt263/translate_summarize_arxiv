    "in recent years , there has been considerable interest in string cosmology because cosmic strings play an important role in the study of early universe .",
    "it is generally assumed that after the big bang , the universe may have undergone a series of phase transitions as its temperature lowered down below some critical temperature as predicted by grand unified theories @xcite@xmath1@xcite . at the very early stages of evolution of the universe",
    ", it is believed that during phase transition the symmetry of the universe is broken spontaneously .",
    "it can give rise to topologically stable defects such as domain walls , strings and monopoles .",
    "in particular , cosmic strings are produced in the breaking of u(1 ) symmetry , are good candidates to seed the formation of galaxies .",
    "these cosmic strings have stress - energy , and couple to the gravitational field .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the gravitational effects that arise from strings .",
    "the pioneering work in the formulation of the energy - momentum tensor for classical massive strings was done by letelier @xcite who considered the massive strings to be formed by geometric strings with particle attached along its extension .",
    "first used this idea in obtaining cosmological solutions in bianchi - i and kantowski - sachs space - times .",
    "stachel @xcite has studied massive string .",
    "the observed universe is satisfactorily described by homogeneous and isotropic models given by the frw space - time .",
    "but at smaller scales , the universe is neither homogeneous and isotropic nor do we expect the universe in its early stages to have these properties .",
    "the anomalies found in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure observations stimulated a growing interest in anisotropic cosmological model of universe . here we confine ourselves to models of bianchi - type ii .",
    "bianchi type - ii space - time has a fundamental role in constructing cosmological models suitable for describing the early stages of evolution of universe .",
    "asseo and sol @xcite emphasized the importance of bianchi type - ii universe .",
    "roy and banerjee @xcite have dealt with locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) cosmological models of bianchi type - ii representing clouds of geometrical as well as massive strings . wang @xcite studied the letelier model in the context of lrs bianchi type - ii space - time .",

    ", kumar @xcite has investigated string cosmological models in bianchi type - ii space - time .",
    "in last few decades there has been considerable interest in alternative theories of gravitation .",
    "the most important among them being scalar - tensor theories proposed by lyra @xcite .",
    "lyra suggested a modification of riemannian geometry which may also be considered as a modification of wey s geometry . in lyra s",
    "geometry , weyl s concept of gauge , which is essentially a metrical concept , is modified by the introduction of a gauge function into the structure less manifold .",
    "this alternating theory is of interest because it produces effects similar to those produced in einstein s theory .",
    "also vector field in this theory plays similar role to cosmological constant in general relativity @xcite .",

    "<S> the paper deals with a spatially homogeneous and totally anisotropic bianchi ii cosmological models representing massive strings in normal gauge for lyra s manifold . </S>",

    "<S> this law generates two type of solutions for average scale factor , one is of power law type and other is of exponential law type . </S>",
    "<S> the power law describes the dynamics of universe from big bang to present epoch while exponential law seems reasonable to project dynamics of future universe . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the displacement actor @xmath0 is a decreasing function of time and it approaches to small positive value at late time , which is collaborated with halford ( 1970 ) as well as recent observations of sn ia . </S>",
    "<S> the study reveals that massive strings dominate in early universe and eventually disappear from universe for sufficiently large time , which is in agreement with the current astronomical observations .     </S>",
