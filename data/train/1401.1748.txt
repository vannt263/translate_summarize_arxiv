    "the correction factor moves the distribution obtained with local interactions in the direction of the distribution including the non - local interactions . in the case of @xmath4sn@xmath0 at @xmath8 mev , the correction factor overshoots at the first peak , but the overall shape of the corrected distribution is in better agreement with the exact result .",
    "it should be noted that the pcf is only valid for non - local potentials of the perey - buck form .",

    "the optical potential must be energy dependent due to non - localities arising from channel couplings . while the specific form chosen for the perey - buck potential is convenient for numerical calculations , a single gaussian term mocking up all energy - independent non - local effects is likely to be an oversimplification .    in an earlier study , rawitscher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the exchange non - locality in @xmath89o scattering and examined the pcf .",
    "the wave functions obtained from their microscopically derived exchange non - locality were reasonably corrected by the pcf .",
    "the exchange non - locality is based on anti - symmetrized wave functions , which will naturally reduce the amplitude of the wave function in the nuclear interior due to the pauli exclusion principle , similarly to the pcf .",
    "results in @xcite show that the pcf is able to approximately take into account the effects of including exchange . in another study by rawitscher @xcite ,",

    "the pcf obtained from the wronskian was also strongly angular momentum dependent , and was found to be larger than unity in some cases .",
    "the channel coupling non - locality is therefore very different than the exchange non - locality , and one should not expect it to be corrected for in the same way . in those studies",
    "@xcite , the exchange and channel coupling non - localities were analyzed separately . to the authors knowledge",
    ", no study has examined the simultaneous inclusion of exchange and channel coupling non - localities .",

    "both the local and non - local binding potentials reproduced the experimental binding energies .",
    "the scattering and bound state wave functions were used in a finite range dwba calculation in order to calculate @xmath0 transfer cross sections .",
    "the pcf was applied to the wave functions generated with the local equivalent potentials .",
    "for the @xmath0 transfer reactions , we found that the explicit inclusion of non - locality to the entrance channel increased the transfer distribution at the first peak by @xmath88 .",
    "the transfer distribution from using a non - local potential increased relative to the distribution from the local potential in most cases . in all cases , the pcf moved the transfer distribution in the direction of the distribution which included non - locality explicitly .",

    "<S> * background : * the effects of non - local potentials have historically been approximately included by applying a correction factor to the solution of the corresponding equation for the local equivalent interaction . </S>",

    "<S> * purpose : * in this work we investigate the validity of the perey correction factor for single - channel bound and scattering states , as well as in transfer @xmath0 cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> * method : * we solve the scattering and bound state equations for non - local interactions of the perey - buck type , through an iterative method . using the distorted wave born approximation , we construct the t - matrix for @xmath0 on @xmath1o , @xmath2ca , @xmath3ca , @xmath4sn , @xmath5sn , and @xmath6pb at @xmath7 and @xmath8 mev . </S>",
    "<S> * results : * we found that for bound states , the perey corrected wave function resulting from the local equation agreed well with that from the non - local equation in the interior region , but discrepancies were found in the surface and peripheral regions . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the perey correction factor was adequate for scattering states , with the exception of a few partial waves corresponding to the grazing impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these differences proved to be important for transfer reactions . * </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : * the perey correction factor does offer an improvement over taking a direct local equivalent solution . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the desired accuracy is to be better than 10% , the exact solution of the non - local equation should be pursued .    </S>",
