    "[ fig : na_diag ] , [ fig : k_diag ] , and [ fig : tio_diag ] ) are clearly not independent ; not only do they share a common color axis , but a star s ,  and tio line strengths all depend on both temperature ( color ) and surface gravity .",
    "the degeneracy between the dwarf and rgb pdfs in these diagnostics at bluer colors ( especially in  and tio ) results in much of their discriminating power coming from the color distribution .",
    "therefore , if most of the stars in the sample are bluer than  @xmath77 , the inclusion of all five of these diagnostics ( , two , and three tio ) will overly weight the color distribution in determining overall likelihood values .",

    "although the vertical axes of the , cmd , and [ fe / h ] diagnostics ( figs .  [ fig : na_diag ] , [ fig : cmd_diag ] , and [ fig : feh_diag ] ) are independent of each other , there is a complicated dependence between the horizontal axes of these three diagnostics .",

    "the tails of the dwarf distribution in the other diagnostics show the same behavior as in this example : no correlation was found between diagnostics .      while our likelihood - based rgb / dwarf separation method is vastly superior to the radial velocity cut used in other spectroscopic surveys of m31 stars (  [ sec : rvcut ] ) , it is far from optimal and will no doubt undergo improvements in the not - too - distant future .",
    "these improvements are beyond the scope of the present paper and will be tackled in a future paper ; we list them here for the sake of completeness .",
    "the covariance of the diagnostics has been discussed in  [ sec : covariance ] .",
    "the degeneracy between the horizontal axes ( color - dependence ) of the two - dimensional diagnostics can be lifted by converting them to one - dimensional diagnostics .",
    "one method which holds promise for the future is to fit a spline to the distribution of training set stars in each diagnostic .",
    "the distribution of vertical distances of the training set stars from the fit will yield a one - dimensional pdf .",
    "once a two - dimensional diagnostic is collapsed into a one - dimensional diagnostic in this way , the latter will have no sensitivity to differences in the  color distribution between m31 rgb and mw dwarf star populations .",
    "this will enable us to incorporate the  and tio diagnostics into the overall likelihood .",
    "another future improvement to the method will be to account for radial trends in the m31 rgb star properties .",
    "we are currently using one m31 rgb training set for all of our fields .",
    "however , we have discovered that m31 rgb stars at large radial distances are systematically more metal - poor than those at smaller radial distances @xcite .",
    "our present method is sub - optimal in that our rgb pdfs do not track the change in the  color distribution of m31 stars with radial distance and are based on a training set that is drawn mostly from m31 s inner spheroid . in order to track this radial trend",
    ", we will need a significantly larger sample of rgb stars in m31 s outer halo to use as a training set .",
    "we expect that a much larger outer halo rgb sample will be available in the next few years .",
    "the likelihood - based method developed in this paper does not explicitly take advantage of our ( admittedly rough ) knowledge of the measurement errors in the quantities used in our various diagnostic plots (  [ sec : error ] ) . for idealized error distributions ,",
    "each training set star can be treated as a gaussian whose width is the quadrature sum of its own measurement error and that of the star for which the likelihood estimate is being made .",
    "naturally , these would be one - dimensional gaussians for the radial velocity and diagnostics and two - dimensional gaussians for the , cmd , and [ fe / h ] diagnostics .",
    "the integral under the gaussian would be the same for each training set star .",
    "the m31 rgb and mw dwarf pdfs would then be the sum of all the gaussians corresponding to the training set stars .",
    "the integral under each pdf would be set to unity .",
    "we hope to implement such a procedure in the future ; with enough stars in the training set the sum of all the gaussians should be smooth enough that it will no longer be necessary to fit analytic functions in order to derive pdfs .      through most of this paper",
    "we have focused on the question : which stars are m31 rgb stars and which ones are mw dwarf stars ?",
    "alternatively , one might ask : what is our best statistical estimate of the number of m31 rgb stars and mw dwarf stars in the sample ?",
    "the first question is clearly important for addressing a wide variety of scientific topics ( such as the metallicity or dynamics of a clean sample of m31 rgb stars ) , but the second question is more relevant when it comes to studies of the spatial density distribution of rgb stars and surface brightness profile and m31 s halo .",
    "the distinction between the above two questions can be illustrated by the following simple scenario .",
    "let us assume there is a measurable @xmath80 and that m31 rgb stars and mw dwarf stars are characterized by different , but overlapping @xmath80 distributions .",
    "armed with only this information , it is impossible to assign a clear designation to any star whose @xmath80 value lies in the overlap region .",
    "however , if the _ shape _ of underlying parent @xmath80 distribution is known for m31 rgb and mw dwarf stars , one can fit a weighted sum of the rgb and dwarf star parent distributions to the observed @xmath80 distribution and thereby determine the fraction of each stellar type in the sample .    in the context of our method , the rgb and dwarf pdfs for each diagnostic ( modulo the other planned improvements of course ) can be treated as the underlying parent distributions .",
    "one could then fit , simultaneously for all diagnostics , a weighted sum of the pdfs to the observed distribution of points .",
    "the outcome of the fit would be our best estimate for the m31 rgb fraction in each field .",
    "we plan to explore such a method in a future paper .",
    "we assess the performance of the likelihood - based method presented in this paper by comparing it to the use of a simple radial velocity cut to select m31 rgb stars .",
    "most previous spectroscopic studies of m31 rgb stars have resorted to using radial velocity cuts : for example , @xcite used @xmath81  km  s@xmath13  while @xcite used @xmath82  km  s@xmath13 .    to investigate the improvement in m31 rgb sample size gained through using our diagnostic method , we applied a velocity cut of @xmath81  km  s@xmath13  to our smooth spheroid sample .",
    "( the disk - dominated field h13d and the stream stars in fields h13s and a3 are excluded from this count . )",
    "this resulted in an rgb sample of 208 stars , compared to 207 stars identified by the likelhood method as secure ( class  + 3 and + 2 ) rgb stars .",
    "however , only 192 stars are in common between the two samples .",
    "this velocity cut recovers 93% of the m31 rgb stars , and 8% of the velocity - selected rgb stars are actually mw dwarf star contaminants .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the outer halo fields ( fields a13 through m11 ) , this velocity cut yields 42 stars while our likelihood method yields 40 secure rgb stars , with 36 stars in common .",
    "thus , a velocity cut of @xmath81  km  s@xmath13  in the outer halo recovers 90% of the m31 rgb stars in these fields , but suffers from a mw dwarf star contamination rate of 19% . as an extreme case , an @xmath83 cut in the radial velocity diagnostic ( which corresponds @xmath84  km  s@xmath13 ) yields four stars in our outermost field  m11 ( @xmath45  kpc ) , but only two of these are secure m31 rgb stars , while one each is a secure mw dwarf and a marginal mw dwarf  i.e . ,  a 50% contamination rate .",
    "moreover , one of the secure m31 rgb stars in this field fails this velocity cut .",
    "if a less conservative velocity cut is made , all the rgb stars can be recovered , but at the price of a larger dwarf contamination rate . when a velocity cut of @xmath82 km  s@xmath13  is made in h11 , our innermost smooth spheroid field",
    ", it yields 120 stars , while our likelihood method finds 102 secure rgb stars .",
    "the sample selected solely on the basis of this velocity cut would have a dwarf contamination rate of 15% .",
    "if this velocity cut is made in field a0 as well as h11 , it yields 203 stars , versus 167 secure rgb stars , for a dwarf contamination rate of 17.7% . finally , if a somewhat more conservative velocity cut of @xmath85 km  s@xmath13  ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is made in the smooth halo fields beyond @xmath43  kpc from the nucleus ( a0 , a13 through m11 ) the total number of stars selected is 140 , compared to 105 secure rgb stars , for a dwarf contamination rate of 25% .    in conclusion , we find that the radial velocity cuts that have been used to isolate m31 rgb stars in other spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield samples that contain a significant fraction of foreground mw dwarf star contaminants and/or are incomplete .",
    "while this may be acceptable for statistical studies of the inner regions of m31 where the surface density of rgb stars greatly exceeds that of foreground mw dwarf stars , the dwarf contamination presents a serious obstacle for studies of m31 s sparse outer halo . as discussed above ,",
    "using a conservative radial velocity cut ( say @xmath86 km  s@xmath13 ) reduces the dwarf contamination rate but causes other complications .",
    "for example , any dynamical analysis of a radial velocity - selected sample of rgb stars would have to take the cut into account .",
    "given the large spread of m31 rgb radial velocities around @xmath87 km  s@xmath13  ( in its dynamically hot bulge and halo and fast rotating disk ) , a radial velocity cut of @xmath86 km  s@xmath13  would lead to substantial incompleteness / bias .",
    "by contrast , our likelihood - based method produces a clean unbiased sample of m31 rgb stars that can directly be used for dynamical ( and other ) studies .      in this section",
    "we switch our attention from comparison with other spectroscopic studies to comparisons with photometric studies of the surface brightness profile of m31 .",
    "it has long been recognized that star count studies are far superior to integrated light measurements @xcite .",
    "star count studies typically select m31 rgb candidates based on location within the cmd and use control fields for statistical subtraction of the `` background '' ( i.e. , foreground mw dwarf star and background field galaxy contaminants * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , systematic errors in background subtraction ( e.g. , due to photometric and/or seeing variations ) limit these techniques to regions of m31 where the surface density of rgb stars is comparable to or greater than the background level ( @xmath88  mag  arcsec@xmath89 ) .",
    "a variety of photometric filtering techniques have been used to increase the contrast of m31 rgb stars with respect to contaminants .",
    "an example of this is the use of @xmath90 photometry to reject background galaxies @xcite . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , @xcite used  photometry to select m31 rgb candidates .",
    "this technique reduces the surface brightness level of the background to @xmath91  mag  arcsec@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above methods , using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics allows us to reliably pick out very sparse groups of m31 rgb stars by rejecting foreground mw dwarf star and background field galaxy contaminants .",
    "the three secure m31 rgb stars identified in our outermost field m11 constitute only a few percent of the overall sample of -selected rgb candidates in that field ; the rest are mw dwarf stars or galaxies .",
    "we use the ratio of secure m31 rgb stars to secure mw dwarf stars , in conjunction with a galactic model @xcite , to estimate m31 s surface brightness profile @xcite .",
    "this allows us to map the outer halo of m31 down to an unprecedented surface brightness level of @xmath92  mag  arcsec@xmath89 .",
    "@xcite study the metallicity distribution of m31 rgb stars isolated by our diagnostic method and find that the stellar halo is significantly more metal poor than the bulge ; this is in contrast to findings from previous photometric studies of a metal - rich stellar `` halo '' in m31 ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as part of a large spectroscopic survey of the outer halo of m31 , we have developed a method to isolate a clean sample of rgb stars in m31 .",
    "this method uses five  diagnostics to isolate rgb stars : radial velocity , photometry , the ew of the  absorption feature , cmd position , and a comparison of spectroscopic vs.  photometric [ fe / h ] estimates .",
    "we also explored diagnostics based on the ews of the k@xmath93 and k@xmath94 absorption features , and the strengths of the tio bands at 7100 , 7600 , and 8500   .",
    "the first five diagnostics are more or less independent of one another ; the , and ti0 diagnostics all show a dependence on stellar effective temperature and are only effective for cool ( red ) stars .",
    "the overall likelihood based on a combination of diagnostics proves to be a much more powerful tool than any of the individual diagnostics alone .",
    "the diagnostic method gives us the ability to confidently identify very sparse populations of m31 rgb stars , and has led to the discovery of stars as distant as @xmath2  kpc ( in projection ) from the galaxy s center .",
    "this technique has allowed us to reach surface brightness levels of @xmath95  mag  arcsec@xmath89 and has enabled us to find an extended stellar halo in m31 that follows an @xmath96 surface brightness profile out to @xmath2  kpc @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the properties of these rgb stars shows that the stars become increasingly metal - poor with increasing distance from m31 s center : beyond @xmath97  kpc , the mean metallicity of our secure m31 rgb sample is found to be @xmath98_{phot}\\rangle=-1.26\\pm0.10 $ ] @xcite .",
    "in addition to identifying sparse populations , our method for isolating m31 rgb stars has the benefit of permitting detailed dynamical studies of the m31 halo , since the selection of stars does not depend on a radial velocity cut and the resulting rgb sample is therefore not kinematically biased .",
    "the application of the diagnostic method to our m31 halo survey provides an unprecedented level of sensitivity , allowing us to reliably study the extent , structure , and kinematics of the remote m31 halo .",
    "we are grateful to sandy faber and the deimos team for building an outstanding instrument and for extensive help and guidance during its first observing season .",
    "we thank peter stetson , jim hesser , and james clem for help with the acquisition and reduction of cfht / megacam images , phil choi , alison coil , geroge helou , drew phillips , and greg wirth for observing some deimos masks on our behalf , drew phillips and marla geha for help with slitmask designs , leo girardi for providing an extensive grid of theoretical stellar isochrones , ricardo schiavon for expert advice on spectral features , jeff lewis , bill mason , and matt radovan for fabrication of slitmasks , and the deep2 team for allowing us use of the spec1d / zspec software .",
