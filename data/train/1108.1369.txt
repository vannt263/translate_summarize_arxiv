    "most of the baryonic matter in the universe is outside stars and galaxies .",
    "it exists primarily as very diffuse plasma in large scale cosmic filaments and galaxy clusters that have formed and are still forming through gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations . both theory and observation",
    "have established that the diffuse intra - cluster media ( icms ) are highly dynamical environments with active `` weather '' driven by ongoing accretion and merging activity , as well as large energy inputs from starburst - driven galactic winds and very fast outflows from active galaxies .",
    "the icms are criss - crossed by complex winds at a fair fraction of the local sound speed that generate weak - to - moderate - strength shocks , contact discontinuities ( known in the community as `` cold fronts '' ) and bulk shear .",
    "provided reynold numbers are large enough such flows should become turbulent .",
    "turbulence is clearly manifested in simulations of cluster formation , and there is growing observational support as well .",
    "for instance random flow velocities appear to have reduced resonance scattering of the 6.7 kev fe emission line @xcite of the icm in the perseus cluster .",
    "thermal pressure fluctuations in the coma cluster are consistent with kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .",
    "patchy faraday rotation patterns looking through several clusters also indicate highly disordered and possibly turbulent magnetic field structures @xcite , as does the absence of large scale polarization in the diffuse synchrotron emission of radio halos seen in a growing number of cluster cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "direct information about the existence of turbulence in cosmic filaments is currently lacking , although there are theoretical reasons to expect the diffuse media of filaments also to develop turbulence ( @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence in these environments is important to understand for many reasons .",
    "turbulent pressure provides support against gravity , so is relevant to cluster mass estimates made from x - ray measurements .",
    "turbulence transports entropy , metals and cosmic rays ; all important cluster evolution diagnostics .",
    "it transports and amplifies magnetic fields ( focus of this paper ) , which in turn control the viscosity , resistivity and thermal conduction in the diffuse media , as well as the propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays .",
    "there is , of course , an extensive literature on turbulence , including mhd turbulence ( see , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "much of the astrophysical mhd turbulence literature ( @xcite ) aims to understand galactic , interstellar media , where the magnetic fields are relatively stronger ( @xmath0 ) than in cluster and filament media ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the simulation effort behind this report focuses on driven mhd turbulence in situations where the initial magnetic field is very weak , so especially relevant to clusters and filaments ( see @xcite for an early report from this study ) .",
    "as noted above the environments of interest are commonly filled with strong drivers of gas motion .",
    "turbulence describes motions possessing significant random velocities .",
    "this random velocity field can include both compressive ( @xmath2 ) and vortical , or solenoidal ( @xmath3 ) components , where @xmath4 is vorticity .",
    "significant amplification of magnetic fields depends on the presence of flow stretching , so on the vortical velocity component ( see equation [ eq : induct ] ) .",
    "thus , understanding mhd turbulence begins with an identification of the sources of vorticity and the manner in which vorticity evolves .",
    "the equation of motion for a viscous fluid can be expressed in terms of vorticity as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinetic viscosity ( assumed constant and isotropic ) @xcite . in an ideal ( @xmath7 ) flow",
    "in which the baroclinic term , @xmath8 , vanishes the net vorticity of a fluid element is conserved ( @xmath9 ) . when the pressure and density gradients are not aligned , such as in colliding flows , vorticity can be added through this term , while viscosity leads to decay of vorticity . in truly isothermal flows , such as those in the simulations we report here",
    ", the baroclinic term will always be zero , since @xmath10 everywhere .    on the other hand a steady , uniform flow ( @xmath11 ) obliquely crossing a curved shock surface will exit downstream with a post - shock vorticity given by `` crocco s theorem '' @xcite , @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the upstream and downstream gas densities , @xmath15 the upstream flow velocity in the shock rest frame , @xmath16 the shock surface curvature tensor , and @xmath17 the shock normal unit vector .",
    "crocco s theorem depends only on mass and momentum conservation at the shock ( on differential flow refraction ) , so it applies even in isothermal shocks , where baroclinicity is absent .",
    "we will explore this vorticity source explicitly below in simulations of compressible , isothermal turbulence driven entirely by sound waves .",
    "turbulence develops as motions driven on a scale , @xmath18 , cascade into chaotic motions on smaller scales , provided the viscous dissipation scale , @xmath19 , is much smaller than @xmath18 . in our context",
    "the driving scale is generally comparable to such things as the curvature radius of a shock , the size of a cluster substructure core , or the scale of an active galaxy or starburst wind outflow .",
    "these likely range for clusters from @xmath20 10s of kpc to @xmath20 100s of kpc . in filaments",
    "even larger driving scales are likely .",
    "the appropriate viscous dissipation scales in these media are far less clear .",
    "they are hot , ionized and very diffuse , so coulomb collisions are ineffective .",
    "the associated mean free path , @xmath21 , ranges from 10s of pc to 10s of kpc in these environments . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the plasma temperature in kev , @xmath23 is the density in @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the ion thermal velocity in 100 km / sec . the corresponding viscosity , @xmath26 is very large , and associated the reynolds numbers , @xmath27 , rather small with @xmath28 the flow velocity on the driving scale .",
    "hence the viscous dissipation scale due to coulomb scattering alone , @xmath29 , would range from fractions of a kpc in cool cluster cores to at least several 10s of kpc in cluster outskirts .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of even a weak magnetic field may reduce the dissipation scale as a result of gyroscale instabilities , such as the firehose and mirror instabilities . then the scattering of particles by the resulting magnetic fluctuations could reduce the particle mean free paths , so also the viscous dissipation scale @xcite .",
    "the detailed picture is still uncertain , however .",
    "we assume below that the physical dissipation scale is at least as small as the effective dissipation scale of our `` ideal fluid '' simulations ; of order the grid resolution . in cluster contexts",
    "this would correspond roughly to kpc dissipation scales .",
    "the magnetic field evolution in a conducting medium is governed by the induction equation . for a generalized ohm s law in the mhd approximation",
    "this is ( @xcite ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the resistivity ( assumed constant and isotropic , ) while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electron density and pressure , respectively .",
    "the last term in equation [ eq : induct ] , which is analogous to the baroclinic source term for vorticity , comes from different electron and ion mobilities .",
    "it is the so - called `` biermann battery '' source term for magnetic fields frequently invoked as a contributor to the generation of cosmic magnetic fields , especially at curved shocks .",
    "it is not commonly included explicitly in mhd simulations and not in those discussed here ( but see , @xcite )    the first term on the right of equation [ eq : induct ] accounts for the important `` stretch - fold '' mechanism that leads to `` small scale '' or `` turbulent '' dynamo field amplification . the resistance term controls field dissipation , of course .",
    "the resistive dissipation scales , @xmath34 , are also uncertain in these environments . in a turbulent flow with @xmath35 , we would have @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "it is possible that the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath38 in the media of interest here . to illustrate ,",
    "if one assumes coulomb scattering controls both dissipative processes , @xmath39 ( @xcite ) . in the simulations reported below the resistivity , like the viscosity has numerical origins ,",
    "so that the resistive dissipation scale is also similar to the grid resolution ; thus , @xmath40 .",
    "isolating turbulence from coherent `` weather '' in the very complex and inhomogeneous flows associated with clusters and filaments is difficult ( but see , @xcite ) . as an alternative tool to explore some of the basic physics we are conducting a high resolution simulation study of the evolution and saturation of driven 3d mhd turbulence in computational domains that resemble these media . since these media , while magnetized , are not magnetically dominated , we focus on turbulence developed with initially very weak magnetic fields .",
    "the full study considers both compressible and incompressible fluids as well as ideal and non - ideal media with a range of magnetic prandtl numbers .",
    "we discuss here , however , only some cases of ideal , compressible flows in isothermal media .",
    "the simulations used an isothermal ideal mhd code that is an updated version of the code presented in @xcite .",
    "initially the medium has a uniform density , @xmath41 , gas pressure , @xmath42 ( so isothermal sound speed , @xmath43 ) and a uniform magnetic field with @xmath44 .",
    "the cubic box has dimensions @xmath45 with periodic boundaries .",
    "the box sound crossing time is thus 10 units .",
    "turbulence is driven by velocity forcing drawn from a gaussian random field determined with a power spectrum , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 @xmath48 , and added at every @xmath49 .",
    "the power spectrum peaks around @xmath50 , or around a scale , @xmath51 .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations is tuned so that @xmath52 or @xmath53 at saturation , close to what results in full cluster simulations ( e.g. , @xcite . using a helmholtz decomposition",
    ", the driving velocity field is separated into solenoidal ( @xmath54 ) and compressive ( @xmath55 ) components .",
    "the fraction of the total driving kinetic energy put into solenoidal motions is designated below by the symbol , @xmath56 .",
    "results are presented here for purely solenoidal , @xmath57 , and , for comparison , purely compressive , @xmath58 driving .",
    "turbulence driving in a cosmic structure formation context will be somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "they are useful , however , in allowing us to focus on the the connection between magnetic field amplification and vorticity on the one hand , and on the possible roles for shocks on the other hand .",
    "our preliminary analysis of intermediate cases , @xmath59 , indicate behaviors that one might reasonably intuit from the two extremes . for the @xmath57 case",
    "we show results from simulations carried out on both @xmath60 and @xmath61 grids .",
    "while not fully converged they agree well in their general properties . for compressive",
    "driving , @xmath58 , we present results from a @xmath62 simulation , which is our highest resolution run to date for that case .",
    "the turbulent kinetic energy balance seems relatively well converged at this resolution , as well as the kinetic energy power spectra on large scales .",
    "the magnetic field properties may not yet be converged for reasons outlined below .",
    "our setup gives a characteristic timescale of bulk motion , @xmath63 .",
    "in that time the motions in both cases spawn some form of hydrodynamical turbulence with power from the driving scale down to the viscous dissipation scale ( a few grid zones ) .",
    "consider first the case with solenoidal driving , which is illustrated in fig .",

    "this is evident for the magnetic field in the power spectrum changes in fig .",
    "[ lineplots ] . the inverse cascade of magnetic energy can be understood as follows .",
    "the field is wrapped more quickly around smaller scale eddies , because the eddy turn over time varies as @xmath76 .",
    "maxwell stresses , @xmath77 , then , feed back on the kinetic turbulence , causing significant modifications in the fluid motions , thus saturating the magnetic field growth on a given scale , @xmath78 , when @xmath79 .",

    "it is not surprising then that the turbulent kinetic energy is predominantly in compressive modes , with the energy ratio , @xmath91 , the inverse of our @xmath57 result .",
    "given the absence of any vorticity in the driving and the absence of any baroclinic vorticity sources , it is actually remarkable that there are vortical motions at all . as noted earlier , the vorticity in this case is created at curved shocks and especially intersecting shocks in accordance with crocco s theorem ( equation [ eq : shock_vort_gen ] ) .",
