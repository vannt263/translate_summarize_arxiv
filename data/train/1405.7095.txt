    "the nucleon structure function physics works out in a fine balance of the perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . the standard approach to the deep - inelastic - scattering",
    "( dis ) physics is based on the so - called factorization theorem , which states that the dis scattering cross section is factorized into two parts , i.e. the hard part which is tractable within the framework of perturbative qcd and the soft part containing the information of nonperturbative nucleon structure @xcite -@xcite .",
    "customarily , the soft part is treated as a black box , which should be determined through experiments .",
    "this is certainly a reasonable strategy .",
    "we however believe that , even if this part is completely fixed by experiments , one would still want to know why those pdfs take the forms so determined .",
    "furthermore , we now realize that a key ingredient to reveal the nonperturbative chiral dynamics of qcd is hidden in the soft part of the dis physics in the form of the flavor structure ( or flavor dependence ) of the sea - quark ( or anti - quark ) distributions @xcite -@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , what can be extracted from the well - founded inclusive dis analyses are only the combinations of quark plus sea - quark ( or anti - quark ) distributions .",
    "to separate out anti - quark distributions , we need either of neutrino - induced dis scattering measurements , semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) measurements or drell - yan measurements . because of the smallness of the neutrino - induced dis cross section , here we are forced to use nuclear targets , which inevitably introduces large theoretical uncertainties in addition to statistical errors arising from the smallness of the event counting rate of neutrino - induced reactions @xcite -@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a lot of efforts have been made for understanding the sidis mechanism @xcite -@xcite , in particular , the fragmentation mechanism of a quark or an antiquark into observed hadrons @xcite -@xcite .",
    "still , one must say that our understanding of the the semi - inclusive reaction mechanism remains at fairly lower level than that of inclusive reactions .",
    "a complementary approach to dis physics is necessary here to clarify possibly important role of chiral dynamics of qcd in the dis physics , based on effective models of qcd or on lattice qcd .",
    "although there are lots of models of baryons , the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) , first proposed by diakonov , petrov and pobylitsa , would probably be the best one @xcite , at least as an effective model of internal partonic structure of the baryons including the nucleon .",
    "( the practical numerical method for handling the cqsm was established in @xcite based on the general methodology of kahana and ripka @xcite .",
    "the unique feature of the cqsm , which plays an important role in the so - called nucleon spin problem , was also pointed out in this paper . for early reviews of the cqsm ,",
    "see @xcite -@xcite . )",
    "the cqsm has a lot of merits over other effective models of baryons .",
    "first , it is a relativistic mean - field theory of quarks , with inclusion of infinitely many dirac - sea orbitals , which means that it is a field theoretical model including infinitely many dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "second , the mean - field is of hedgehog - shape in harmony with the nonperturbative dynamics expected from large @xmath1 qcd .",
    "one interesting consequence of this unique feature of the model is strong spin - isospin correlation ( or anti - correlation ) in the generated nucleon seas @xcite .",
    "third , in association with the first advantage , its field theoretical nature enables us reasonable estimation not only of quark distributions but also of antiquark distributions @xcite - @xcite .",
    "last but not least , only one parameter of the flavor su(2 ) version of the model .",
    "i.e the dynamically generated quark mass @xmath2 , is already fixed to be @xmath3 from low energy phenomenology as well as from theoretical ground @xcite . to handle the strange - quark degrees of freedom in the nucleon",
    ", we must extend the model to flavor su(3 ) .",
    "however , this flavor su(3 ) extension of the model need to introduce only one additional parameter , i.e. the mass difference between the strange and nonstrange quarks @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this means that we can still make nearly parameter - free predictions for parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with variant species of meson cloud ( convolution ) models , which are also believed to incorporate the nonperturbative chiral dynamics of qcd .",
    "in fact , the meson cloud models contain quite a few model parameters such as several meson - quark coupling constants , coupling form factors , parameters of parton distributions in the mesons , and so forth @xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , the model predictions often depend critically on how many meson - baryon intermediate states are included in the theoretical calculations .",
    "this last fact is sometimes a serious obstruction for giving unique and quantitatively trustable predictions on the sea - quark distributions in the nucleon .",
    "we emphasize again that the cqsm does not suffer from these bothersome problems , because it is nearly parameter - free . as a matter of course , the biggest problem or shortcoming common in all the low energy",
    "effective models of the nucleon including the cqsm is a lack of explicit gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "this point should always be kept in mind when applying low energy models of the nucleon to the dis physics , as we shall discuss later .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to unravel the nonperturbative chiral dynamics of qcd hidden in the parton distribution functions of the nucleon through the analysis of the flavor structure of the nucleon seas .",
    "an important point is that the flavor structure of the nucleon seas including the strange quark degrees of freedom is analyzed simultaneously for the unpolarized pdfs and for the longitudinally polarized pdfs within a single theoretical framework .",
    "it is the flavor su(3 ) version of the cqsm , which contains only one adjustable parameter , i.e. the effective mass difference between the strange and nonstrange quarks .",
    "to get a feeling about the reliability of the model , we first carry out a systematic comparison between the model predictions and the results of the most recent unbiased global fits by the nnpdf group . in our opinion , this systematic comparison is of special importance .",
    "this is because , if one picks up only a specific distribution functions , it would not be extremely difficult to reproduce the corresponding empirical distributions , especially by the models like the meson cloud models containing many parameters as well as freedoms .",
    "unfortunately , it sometimes happens that such an agreement is fortuitous and the same model with the same set of parameters fails to reproduce other independent distributions .",
    "this is the reason why we believe it important to check how well a particular model can or can not reproduce wide class of empirical pdfs simultaneously .",
    "we also investigate the charge - symmetry - violating ( csv ) effects in the parton distribution functions based on exactly the same theoretical framework .",
    "the motivation to investigate the csv effects in the nucleon parton distributions is as follows .",
    "it is known that , to resolve the widely - known anomaly on the weinberg angle of the electroweak standard model raised in the analysis of the neutrino - induced dis measurements by the nutev group @xcite,@xcite , the two mechanisms of qcd origin are believed to play important roles .",
    "they are the asymmetry of the strange and anti - strange quark distributions in the nucleon and the csv effects in the valence - quark distributions in the proton and the neutron . which of these ingredients is more important is not a completely settled issue @xcite -@xcite .",
    "we believe that the analysis of the @xmath4-@xmath5 asymmetry and the csv distributions within a single theoretical framework would provide us with a valuable information on the relative importance of these two mechanisms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . first , in sect.ii , through the comparison of the predictions of the su(3 )",
    "cqsm for the unpolarized pdfs with the recent global fits by the nnpdf group @xcite , we try to estimate the degrees of reliability of the model .",
    "after that , we concentrate on inspecting the characteristic feature of the model predictions for flavor structure of the unpolarized light - flavor sea quark distributions , which has not been determined very reliably on the observational basis alone",
    ". the characteristic predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm will be compared with the predictions of other models of the sea - quark distributions in the nucleon as well as with other empirical information if available . in sect.iii ,",
    "a similar analysis is carried out for the longitudinally polarized pdfs , the global analyses of which was recently reported by nndpd group @xcite .",
    "next , in sect.iv , we investigate the csv effects in the light - flavor quark and anti - quark distributions within exactly the same framework of the su(3 ) cqsm .",
    "a main emphasis there is put on getting useful information on the relative importance of the csv effects and the strange and anti - strange quark asymmetry in the resolution of the nutev anomaly for the weinberg angle .",
    "then , we summarize what we have learned on the flavor structure of the nucleon seas in sect.v .",
    "the theoretical formulation of the flavor su(3 ) cqsm for evaluating the pdfs in a baryon was already described in detail in our previous papers @xcite,@xcite .",
    "( the su(3 ) cqsm itself was first proposed in @xcite . )",
    "we therefore give here only a brief sketch of it by confining to its basic theoretical structure .",
    "the model lagrangian of the flavor su(3 ) cqsm is a straightforward extension of the su(2 ) one .",
    "it is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the su(3 ) symmetric part of the lagrangian , while @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the su(3 ) breaking part resulting from the mass difference between the strange and non - strange quarks .",
    "( here , we neglect the light - quark masses so that @xmath11 . )",
    "the above effective lagrangian contains eight meson fields instead of three in the case of the flavor su(2 ) model .",
    "however , we recall that , in the framework of the cqsm , these meson fields are not independent fields of quarks , as inferred from the fact that there is no kinetic term of the meson fields in the above basic lagrangian of the model .",
    "now , fundamental dynamical assumptions of the model is as follows .",
    "* first , the lowest energy classical solution ( or the mean - field solution ) is obtained by the embedding of su(2 ) mean - field solution of hedgehog shape into the su(3 ) matrix .",
    "( the same dynamical assumption is also used in more familiar su(3 ) skyrme model @xcite-@xcite . )",
    "* second is the su(3 ) symmetric quantization of the rotational motion in the collective coordinate space . *",
    "the third is the perturbative treatment of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking mass term .",
    "we recall that this mass difference @xmath0 between the strange and nonstrange quarks is _ only one parameter _ of the model .",
    "we fix this only one parameter of the model is as follows .",
    "it is taken as an adjustable parameter between the physically reasonable range @xmath12 . as a general rule ,",
    "the distribution functions for the light - flavor @xmath13- and @xmath14-quarks are generally rather insensitive to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "as naturally expected , what are most sensitive to the value of @xmath0 is the strange - quark distributions .",
    "we found that overall good reproduction of the shape of the empirical strange quark distribution @xmath15 is obtained with the choice @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore fix the value of @xmath0 to be @xmath17 and continue to use it throughout all the following calculations .",
    "this means that there remains no more free parameter in the model .    before going to the discussion on the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm for the unpolarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in comparison with the empirical information given at the high energy scales , we think it important to explain our general strategy for applying an effective model to dis physics .",
    "it is widely believed that the predictions of effective models of hadrons should be taken as those given in the low energy domain of nonperturbative qcd , while the parton distribution functions extracted from experiments correspond to high energy scale of perturbative qcd .",
    "a difficult question is how to harmonize two domains of qcd .",
    "it is customarily assumed that the model predictions for pdfs given at the low energy scale can be related through qcd evolution equation to empirically extracted pdfs at high energy .",
    "the central difficulty we encounter here is a matching scale problem .",
    "that is , it is far from trivial how to specify the exact model energy scale from which one starts the evolution as above . most effective models of baryons like the mit bag model or the meson cloud models use fairly low starting energy @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "there is some argument that the starting energy of the cqsm should be taken to be a little higher .",
    "in fact , we recall here the argument by petrov et al .",
    "based on the instanton picture of the qcd vacuum @xcite,@xcite , which is thought to give a theoretical foundation of the cqsm .",
    "according to them , the scale of the cqsm is set by the inverse of the average instanton size @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "although reasonable , it seems to us that the relation between the choice of initial scale and the average instanton size is very qualitative .",
    "it just indicates that any choice between @xmath21 and @xmath22 would be equally well .",
    "a fully satisfactory choice of the initial energy scale of evolution would be obtained only when one carries out a proper renormalization procedure of nonperturbative qcd , as is actually done in the framework of lattice qcd , although the calculation of the pdfs is not yet possible in this promising framework .",
    "( another advantage of the lattice qcd treatment is that the renormalization is carried out at fairly high - energy scale , i.e. @xmath23 , where one can safely starts the perturbative evolution to higher energy scales . ) even though there is a theoretical indication that the model scale of the cqsm is higher than those of other effective models of baryons , it is still much smaller than the scale of @xmath24 , so that some sensitivity of the final predictions on the choice of the initial scale of evolution can not be completely avoided .",
    "for instance , we find that the two choices @xmath25 and @xmath26 cause difference in the range of @xmath27 for the heights of valence - like peaks of the unpolarized pdfs at @xmath28 . since better agreement with the empirical pdfs is obtained with the choice @xmath25 , we continue to use this value , which was the value used in our previous studies @xcite -@xcite .     at the nlo in dependence of @xmath29 .",
    "the filled triangle ( red in color ) corresponds to the frequently used starting energy scale of evolution in the mit bag model or meson cloud models , whereas the filled square ( blue in color ) to the starting energy scale used in the cqsm.,width=321 ]    in any case , we emphasize again that the value @xmath25 which we use as the initial scale of evolution in the cqsm is a little higher than the value @xmath18 frequently used in many effective models of baryons like the mit bag model or the meson cloud models .",
    "this difference is sometimes critical , because the validity of using perturbative evolution equation at too low energy scales is a delicate question .",
    "in fact , we show in fig.[fig01_alphas_nlo ] the qcd running coupling constant at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "( here we have used the exact solution of the nlo evolution equation with the standard @xmath30 scheme in the fixed - flavor scheme with @xmath31 even beyond the charm threshold . however",
    ", the effects of charm on the quantity discussed here would be very small as compared with the necessary precision of our discussion . ) one sees that the @xmath32 at the scale of @xmath33 already shows a diverging behavior , which throws a little doubt on the use of the perturbative renormalization group equation at such scales . on the other hand , at the initial energy scale of the cqsm , i.e. at @xmath34",
    ", the perturbative qcd may be barely applicable .",
    "( whether the value of @xmath35 at the scale @xmath36 is large or small is a delicate question .",
    "however , more transparent measure of the applicability of the perturbative renormalization group equation is provided by the change rate of @xmath32 as a function of @xmath29 , which can be easily read in .",
    "another remark is that , if one uses the lo evolution equation , the diverging behavior of @xmath37 appears at lower energy scale .",
    "this is one of the reason why many low energy models like the mit bag model or the meson cloud models adopt the lo evolution equation together with very low starting energy of evolution .",
    "however , since the main purpose of our analysis is to compare the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm with the nnpdf fits carried out at the nlo , the consistency requires to use the evolution scheme at the nlo . )    as shown above , although our choice of a little higher starting energy of evolution is preferable from the standpoint of using the scheme of perturbative renormalization group equation , there is one thing which we must pay attention to .",
    "the key quantities in our argument here are the momentum fractions of quarks and gluons as functions of the energy scale @xmath29 .",
    "up to this time , the momentum fractions of quarks and gluons in the nucleon at the high - energy scale are fairly precisely known .",
    "given below are the empirical values for the quark and gluon momentum fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 given at @xmath23 by the mrst2004 analysis @xcite,@xcite : @xmath40 here , for simplicity , we have neglected very small error bars . as an interesting trial",
    ", we carried out a _ downward evolution _ of the quark and gluon momentum fraction , by starting with these known empirical values at the high energy scale .",
    "the results are respectively shown by the solid and the long - dashed curves in fig.[fig02_xq_xg_nlo ] .",
    ", obtained by solving the qcd evolution equation at the nlo with the initial conditions @xmath41 and @xmath42 given at @xmath23 by the mrst2004 analysis @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the filled square ( blue in color ) corresponds to the starting energy scale used in the cqsm.,width=340 ]    as anticipated , as @xmath29 decreases , the quark momentum fraction @xmath38 increases , whereas the gluon momentum fraction @xmath39 decreases to eventually become zero at a certain energy scale .",
    "an important observation here is the fact that , at the model energy scale of the cqsm , i.e. @xmath34 , the gluon still carries about 20 % of the nucleon momentum . since the cqsm is an effective quark model , which does not contain explicit gluon degrees of freedom , to start the evolution at @xmath36 amounts to neglecting important role of gluons , which are likely to carry about 20 % of the nucleon momentum even at this relatively low energy scale .",
    "we will show later that this observation has an important phenomenological consequence in the interpretation of the predictions of the cqsm evolved to the high energy scales .    before proceeding further",
    ", it would be fair to refer to another limitation of the cqsm .",
    "the limitation is due to general restriction from the limit of large numbers of colors @xmath1 . as argued by diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , the cqsm provides a practical realization of large-@xmath1 qcd , so that the parton distribution functions depend on the bjorken variable @xmath43 in such a way that @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 . since @xmath46 in nature",
    ", this dictates that the cqsm is a good approximation to qcd only in the region of `` not too small '' @xmath43 in order to comply with the above scaling law . more concrete argument on the applicability range of @xmath43",
    "was given in the paper by petrov et al .",
    "since the cqsm is an effective theory of qcd , which is not renormalizable , it needs a physical cutoff .",
    "an effective regularization energy @xmath47 is provided by the inverse of the average instanton size @xmath19 as @xmath48 .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "argued that , in the region @xmath49 , the model predictions for the parton distributions are sensitive to the cutoff energy and/or the detail of the regularization method , so that they are not necessarily reliable . in the following study , we take less ambitious pragmatic standpoint that the cqsm is one of the effective models of baryons like the mit bag model or the meson cloud models , and will show the predicted pdfs in the whole range of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath50 , although the above caution should be kept in mind .",
    "now we are in a position to compare the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm for the unpolarized pdfs with the empirically extracted ones .",
    "first , to get a feeling about the degrees of success or failure of the model , we compare our predictions with the recent unbiased global fits of unpolarized pdfs by the nnpdf group .",
    "( here , we use the nnpdf nlo2.1 fits at the nlo with @xmath31 @xcite . )",
    "the nnpdf fits are given at @xmath28 for the following combinations of the pdfs :    * the singlet distribution , @xmath51 , * the gluon , @xmath52 , * the total valence , @xmath53 , * the nonsinglet triplet , @xmath54 , * the sea asymmetry distribution , @xmath55 , * the strange anti - strange sum , @xmath56 , * the strange anti - strange difference , @xmath57 .    for making a comparison , the cqsm predictions given at the initial scale @xmath25",
    "are evolved to the corresponding scale of @xmath28 by using the evolution equations at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "to @xmath28 in comparison with the nnpdf2.1 nlo global fits shown by the shaded areas @xcite .",
    "the solid curves are the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm .",
    "the long - dashed curves for the strange quark distribution are the reduced predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm by a factor of @xmath58 explained in the text.,width=566 ]    fig.[fig03_allunpol_nsinglet ] show the comparison for the pdfs , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "we find fairly good agreement between the theory and the nnpdf fits for the flavor nonsinglet triplet distribution @xmath63 and the light - flavor sea asymmetry @xmath64 .",
    "the detailed inspection reveals that the agreements are not perfect .",
    "however , in view of almost parameter - free nature of the model , this agreement can be taken as one of the nontrivial successes of the cqsm , which properly takes account of the chiral dynamics of qcd .",
    "( incidentally , we stress that these distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath0 . )",
    "turning to the strange distributions , we find that the model prediction for @xmath65 appears to overestimate the nnpdf fit roughly by a factor of two .",
    "this feature of the model prediction could be anticipated . as was intensively discussed for the su(3 ) skyrme model , the su(3 ) symmetric collective quantization supplemented with the perturbative treatment of the su(3 ) breaking mass difference term , which is taken over to our treatment of the su(3 ) cqsm , has a danger of overestimating the effects of kaon clouds , which might in turn lead to an overestimation of the strange quark components in the nucleon @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we conjecture that plausible predictions for the strange and anti - strange distributions in the nucleon would lie just between the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm and the su(2 ) cqsm , which amounts to multiplying a reduction factor @xmath58 to the su(3 ) cqsm predictions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the reduction factor of just @xmath58 has no strict foundation and rather ad hoc .",
    "it can be any number between @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in principle",
    ", this reduction factor can be treated as additional parameter of the model . however , there is no absolutely trustworthy empirical information to fix this parameter .",
    "we therefore simply say that , as seen from fig.[fig03_allunpol_nsinglet ] , after multiplying this reduction factor of @xmath58 , the model prediction for @xmath70 is order of magnitude consistent with the current nnpdf fit , except for larger @xmath43 region , where the nnpdf fit does not necessarily respect the positivity of the distribution .    also very interesting is the asymmetry of strange and anti - strange distributions .",
    "noteworthy feature of the nnpdf fit is that the difference distribution @xmath71 $ ] has a peak around @xmath72 .",
    "very curiously , this feature is perfectly consistent with the prediction of the su(3 ) cqsm .",
    "the good agreement is not limited to the position of the peak .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the asymmetry is also consistent with the nnpdf fit .",
    "note that the bare prediction of the su(3 ) cqsm and the reduced prediction by a factor of @xmath58 are both consistent with the nnpdf fit within the uncertainty band , although we prefer the reduced prediction .",
    "next , in fig.[fig04_allunpol_singlet ] , we show the model predictions for the singlet distribution @xmath73 , the gluon distribution @xmath52 , and the net valence distribution @xmath74 , in comparison with the nnpdf fits . as compared with the success for the nonsinglet distributions , we find that the model prediction overestimates the nnpdf fit by about 20 % .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy may be interpreted as follows .",
    "we already pointed out that , at the starting energy scale of evolution , the gluon field is likely to carry about 20 % of the total nucleon momentum , which means that the quark fields carry only about 80 % of the nucleon momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "the cqsm is an effective quark model , which does not contain explicit gluon degrees of freedom , the net nucleon momentum is naturally saturated by the momenta of quarks and anti - quarks at the model scale .",
    "thus , we simply had to set the gluon distribution to be zero at the starting energy scale of evolution , i.e. at @xmath25 .",
    "this naturally fails to take account of the fact that the net momentum fraction of quarks at the initial scale must be only about 80 % , which would then lead to an overestimation of the flavor singlet combination of the quark and anti - quark distribution @xmath73 by about 20 % . by the same reason",
    ", we can not expect that the model can give a reasonable description of the gluon distribution even though nonzero gluon distribution is generated through evolution .",
    "naturally , the gluon distribution obtained in this way has no valence - like peak as observed in the empirical fit .    turning to the total valence distribution @xmath74",
    ", one again observes that the model prediction overestimates the nnpdf fit by about 20 % .",
    "the reason of this overestimation is slightly more complicated than the singlet distribution @xmath73 . since this distribution @xmath74 is given as a difference of the quark and anti - quark distributions , it does not couple to the gluon distribution at the process of scale evolution different from the distribution @xmath73 .",
    "still , since it is a symmetric sum of the three flavors , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath4 , the possible overestimation of the net distribution at the initial energy scale pointed out before is likely to remain also at higher energy scales .",
    "another possible reason would be that the model might still underestimate the sum of the light - flavor sea quark distributions , i.e. , @xmath75 , which leads to the overestimation of the combination @xmath76 , provided that the contribution of @xmath77 in this combination is small .",
    "a lesson learned from the above analysis is as follows .",
    "the overall agreement between the su(3 ) cqsm and the nnpdf2.1 nlo fits are fairly good in view of nearly parameter - free nature of the model predictions . however , the agreement is not naturally perfect .",
    "the main reason of discrepancy would be the neglect of the gluon degrees of freedom , which appears to play non - negligible roles in the flavor - singlet channel even at relatively low energy scales .",
    "on the other hand , we shall see in the next section that the role of gluons at the low energy model scale of the cqsm is likely to be much less important in the case of longitudinally polarized distributions .",
    "after having got a feeling on the degrees of reliability of the model as well as its limitation , through the comparison with the unbiased global fits of the unpolarized pdfs by the nnpdf groups , we now turn our attention to more detailed inspection on the flavor structure of the sea - quark ( anti - quark ) distributions in the nucleon . to unravel the underlying physics , particularly instructive here",
    "is a comparison with related theoretical investigations as well as other experimental information if available .",
    "first , we call attention to the strange distribution @xmath15 in the nucleon extracted from the analysis of charged kaon production in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) by the hermes group @xcite .",
    "as is widely known , the extracted @xmath15 distribution appears to have intriguing two - component structure as illustrated in fig.[fig05_xs_chang_peng ] . here ,",
    "following the paper @xcite , the hermes data with @xmath78 are represented by the open circles , while those with @xmath79 are by the filled black circles just by the reason of guidance for eye .     from the initial scale of the model @xmath80.,width=302",
    "]    the observed two - peaked structure motivates chang and peng to introduce an interesting physical interpretation to be explained below @xcite .",
    "( see also more recent paper by chang , cheng , peng and liu @xcite . )",
    "their interpretation is based on the idea of intrinsic charm in the nucleon proposed many years ago by brodsky , hoyer , petesen , and sakai @xcite,@xcite ( bhps model ) . according to bhps ,",
    "the intrinsic sea is a component that is expected to have valence - like peak at larger @xmath43 , while the extrinsic sea is thought to be generated through qcd splitting processes .",
    "inspired by this idea , chang and peng et al .",
    "proposed an idea that @xmath81 hermes data are dominated by `` intrinsic '' sea , while @xmath78 data from `` extrinsic '' sea @xcite . according to them ,",
    "a component of the hermes data , which has a peak around @xmath82 can be reproduced by the intrinsic 5-quark model ( see the solid curve in fig.[fig05_xs_chang_peng ] ) with the mixing rate @xmath83 of the 5-quark component in the nucleon . at first sight",
    ", this appears to provide a reasonable explanation of the peak structure of @xmath84 $ ] in the higher @xmath43 region .",
    "however , the following question immediately arises . admitting that the account of the 5-quark component nicely explains the peak structure at higher @xmath43 , how can one explain the sea - like component in the lower @xmath43 domain ?",
    "what is important to recognize here is the fact that the solid curve in fig.[fig05_xs_chang_peng ] shows the theoretical prediction , which was obtained after taking account of the evolution effects by solving the evolution equation starting from the scale @xmath85 .",

    ", this is just a feature expected from the kaon cloud model of the nucleon advocated by signal and thomas @xcite , burkardt and warr @xcite , and also by brodsky and ma @xcite many years ago . according to the kaon cloud picture , the strange and anti - strange quark distributions in the proton",

    "although we believe that this meson cloud picture gets straight to the point in a qualitative sense , its quantitative predictability can not be expected too much , because the meson cloud models generally contain too many adjustable parameters and large ambiguities .",
    "a great advantage of the cqsm is that it does not assume any explicit meson - baryon intermediate states like the nucleon and pion , the nucleon and rho meson , and the lambda and kaon , etc .",
    "note that the above difference between the strange and anti - strange quark distributions is an automatic consequence of almost parameter - free calculation . here",
    ", it is very important to recognize the fact that not only the valence - like component but also the sea - like component are generated as a consequence of solving the bound state equation of the nucleon . in this sense",
    ", one can call the latter too as `` intrinsic '' sea not `` extrinsic '' sea , even though it is not a component with valence - like character .",
    "the point is that the basic theoretical framework of the cqsm is the mean - field theory ( followed by the collective quantization of the zero - energy rotational modes ) , which enables us to incorporate infinitely many higher multi - quark components in the language of perturbative fock - space expansion .",

    "in fact , according to chang and peng , the strange quark distribution @xmath84 $ ] also contains the `` intrinsic '' component .",
    "but , this `` intrinsic '' sea requires at least 5-quark component , which needs to take account of disconnected seas within the framework of lattice qcd .    in our opinion , just like that the decomposition into the `` intricsic '' sea and the `` intrinsic '' is a model - dependent idea , the decomposition into the connected sea and the disconnected sea is an idea , which has a definite meaning only within the framework of the lattice qcd formulation of qcd .",

    "furthermore , within the framework of the cqsm , there is no idea of decomposing the anti - quark distributions into the two components like the `` intrinsic '' and `` extrisic '' sea . both",
    "are contained within a single theoretical scheme without any separation between them .",
    "this reconfirms again that the separation of the anti - quark distribution into the `` intricsic '' and `` extrinsic '' components or into the connected and disconnected seas is a _ theoretical - scheme - dependent idea _ , although we never deny its usefulness for understanding the nature quark seas in the nucleon .",
    "in this section , we compare the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm for the longitudinally - polarized pdfs with empirically extracted ones .",

    "remember that , in the case of unpolarized pdfs , the flavor singlet quark distribution was not reproduced very well .",

    "put another way , a good agreement for the flavor - singlet polarized distribution @xmath135 indicates that the neglect of the gluon contribution at the model energy scale does little harm .",
    "accordingly , the following picture emerges . at the low energy scale corresponding to the cqsm ,",
    "the gluon is likely to carry about 20 % of the nucleon momentum fraction , but it carries negligiblly small polarization .",

    "this gives @xmath179 this means that the nutev measurement of @xmath180 will be shifted to @xmath181 which agree with the standard value @xmath182 , although we should perform more careful analysis in view of the approximate nature of the above correction formula .",
    "anyhow , our finding here can be summarized as follows .",
    "the effect of the particle - antiparticle asymmetry of the strange quark distribution to the nutev anomaly seems to be much larger than the csv effect in the valence quark distribution originating from the @xmath13-@xmath14 quark mass difference .",
    "however , the csv effect due to the qed splitting mechanism is an increasing function of the scale @xcite,@xcite and its effect on the nutev anomaly can have the same order of magnitude as that of the strange asymmetry at the scale of @xmath150 .     in comparison with the corresponding distributions generated by the qed splitting mechanism @xcite.,width=340 ]    since one of the advantages of the cqsm is that it can give reasonable predictions not only for the quark distributions but also for the antiquark distributions , we think it interesting to evaluate the csv effect in the sea - quark distributions in this model .",
    "the solid and long - dashed curves in fig.[fig18_gdr_csv_sea ] represent the csv light - flavor sea - quark distributions defined by @xmath183 here , the solid and long - dashed curves ( black in color ) correspond to the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm , while the dash - dotted and short - dashed curves ( blue in color ) correspond to the predictions based on the qed splitting mechanism @xcite . very curiously , the predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm for @xmath184 and @xmath185 and the corresponding predictions due to the qed splitting mechanism have nearly equal magnitudes but their signs are opposite .",
    "this means that , if we add up both contributions , a sizable cancellation occurs , which would indicate that the net csv effects on the sea - quark distribution would be very small and hard to observe experimentally .",
    "$ ] with @xmath186 in comparison with the csv effects to the light - flavor valence - like distributions @xmath187 $ ] and @xmath188$].,width=340 ]    finally , just to make sure , we estimate the csv effect on the valence - like strange quark distribution , i.e. @xmath189 in comparison with the csv effects on the light - flavor valence quark distribution .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig19_csv_uds_val ] .",
    "one simply confirms that the csv effect on the strange distribution is in fact very small .",
    "to conclude , we have analyzed the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized pdfs in the nucleon within a single theoretical framework of the su(3 ) cqsm , which contains only one adjustable parameter @xmath0 , the mass difference between the strange and nonstrange quarks . through detailed comparisons with the recent global pdf fits by the nnpdf group , the dssv group , and the cteq group , etc . , we could confirm that , despite its nearly parameter - free nature , the model reproduces all the qualitative characteristics of the empirically determined pdfs .",
    "besides , it gives unique and nontrivial predictions on the flavor structure of the sea - quark distributions .",
    "they are the flavor asymmetry of the unpolarized sea - quark distributions , @xmath190 , dictated by the famous nmc measurement , the flavor asymmetry of the longitudinally polarized sea - quark distributions , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , the particle - antiparticle asymmetry of the unpolarized strange quark distribution , @xmath193 , and also the particle - antiparticle asymmetry of the longitudinally polarized strange quark distributions , @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "the success is naturally connected with the fact that the model incorporates the most important feature of the qcd in the nonperturbative low energy domain , i.e. the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the appearance of the associated goldstone bosons .",
    "still , an important difference with more familiar meson cloud models should be clearly recognized . as stated above",
    ", the cqsm predicts large isospin asymmetry not only for the unpolarized seas but also for the longitudinally polarized ones . on the other hand , although the meson cloud models nicely explains the flavor asymmetry of the unpolarized sea - quark distributions , they generally predict very small spin polarization of sea quarks , reflecting the fact that the pion carries no spin and the effects of heavier meson cloud are suppressed . in view of this important difference",
    ", more unambiguous confirmation of the flavor asymmetry of the longitudinally polarized sea - quark distribution is an urgent task .",
    "we have pointed out that , for that the model predictions are taken as reliable also in a quantitative sense , we need two remedies . first , the information from phenomenological global fits indicates that the gluon carries about 20 % of the nucleon momentum fraction even at the low energy scale corresponding to the cqsm .",
    "naturally , this fact is not properly incorporated in effective quark models like the cqsm .",
    "as we have seen , this seems to be a cause of about 20 % overestimate of the flavor - singlet combination of the unpolarized pdfs .",
    "however , we have also shown that the neglect of the gluon degrees of freedom at the model energy scale is likely to do little harm in the case of the longitudinally polarized pdfs .",
    "this is the reason why the success of the model is more salient for the longitudinally polarized pdfs than for the unpolarized pdfs .",
    "the second problem is that the su(3 ) symmetric collective quantization ( with the subsequent perturbative treatment of the su(3 ) symmetry breaking mass difference between the strange and nonstrange quarks ) might tend to overestimate the kaon cloud effects , thereby having a danger of overvaluing the magnitudes of the strange quark distributions .",
    "as the present analysis , especially the detailed comparison with the unbiased nnpdf global fits , strongly indicates , plausible predictions for the strange and antistrange quark distributions would corresponds to an average of the su(3 ) and su(2 ) cqsm , which means that we can get reliable predictions for the strangeness - related distributions if we multiply a reduction factor of about @xmath58 to the bare predictions of the su(3 ) cqsm .",
    "after this modification to the strange quark distributions is taken into account , we have good reason to believe that the su(3 ) cqsm is already giving reliable predictions with @xmath196 accuracy for both of the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized pdfs , including the key issues of the present research , i.e. the flavor structure of the sea - quark distribution in the nucleon .",
    "we hope that these characteristic predictions reported in the present paper will be tested through more elaborate analyses of the neutrino - induced dis measurements , the semi - inclusive dis measurements , the polarized drell - yan processes in @xmath197 or @xmath198 collisions , etc .",
    ", to be carried out in the near future .",
