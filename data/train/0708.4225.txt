    "mixing in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system has been searched for for more than two decades without success  until this past year .",
    "both `` @xmath4-factory '' experiments , belle and , have recently published evidence for this phenomenon  @xcite . here",
    "we review these measurements and discuss their implications . in total four measurements",
    "are presented , involving the following decay modes  @xcite : , , , and .    mixing in heavy flavor systems such as that of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is governed by the short - distance box diagram . however , in the @xmath0 system this diagram is both doubly - cabibbo - suppressed and gim - suppressed relative to the amplitude dominating the decay width , and thus the short - distance rate is very small .",
    "consequently , @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing is expected to be dominated by long - distance processes that are difficult to calculate ; theoretical estimates for the mixing parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 range over two - three orders of magnitude  @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the differences in the masses and decay widths , respectively , of the two @xmath0-@xmath1 mass eigenstates , and @xmath11 is the mean decay width .",
    "all methods discussed here identify the flavor of the @xmath12 when produced by reconstructing the decay @xmath13 or @xmath14 ; the charge of the accompanying pion identifies the @xmath15 flavor . because @xmath16 , which is relatively small , the pion has very low momentum and thus is denoted @xmath17 ( `` @xmath18 slow '' ) .",
    "the @xmath0 decay time ( @xmath19 ) is calculated via @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the distance between the @xmath22 and @xmath0 decay vertices and @xmath23 is the @xmath0 momentum .",
    "the @xmath22 vertex position is taken to be the intersection of the @xmath17 momentum with the beamspot profile .",
    "most of the precision on @xmath19 is due to the vertical ( @xmath24 ) component of @xmath21 , as the spread of the beamspot is only a few microns in this dimension . to reject @xmath25",
    "decays originating from @xmath4 decays , one requires @xmath26 , which is the kinematic endpoint .",
    "the decay  is in principle an ideal signature for mixing , as this `` wrong - sign '' ( ws ) final state can be reached only via a @xmath27 transition ( in contrast to the `` right - sign '' ( rs ) final state @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , the neutrino in the final state precludes the decay from being fully - reconstructed , and consequently the decay time measurement is smeared .",
    "the decay time dependence is given by @xmath29 $ ] , and both belle and   measure the coefficient @xmath30 by fitting the decay time distribution .",
    "to reduce backgrounds , only the electron channel ( @xmath31 ) has been used .",
    "belle uses 253  fb@xmath32 of data  @xcite , making a relatively loose event selection and fitting the resulting @xmath33 and @xmath34 distributions to determine the yield of ws events . to improve the resolution on both @xmath9 and the decay time",
    ", two corrections are made to better determine @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total four - momentum of all tracks and photons in the event besides the @xmath17 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 candidates , and @xmath39 is the four - momentum of the center - of - mass ( cms ) system .",
    "first , @xmath36 is rescaled by a factor @xmath40 such that @xmath41 ; second , @xmath42 is rotated in the plane of @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "the ratio of ws to rs events are measured for six bins of decay time ranging from one to ten @xmath0 lifetimes .",
    "summing over all bins , @xmath45 rs and @xmath46 ws events are found .",
    "for each bin the ratio depends on @xmath47 , and the six resulting values of @xmath47 are fit to a constant .",
    "the result is @xmath48 where the first error listed is statistical and the second error is systematic .",
    "the latter is dominated by uncertainty in the background @xmath9 pdf .",
    "as much of the @xmath47 likelihood is in the unphysical ( negative ) region , belle uses a feldman - cousins  @xcite approach to calculate an upper limit ; the result is @xmath49 at 90% c.l .",
    "this limit implies both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath52% .",
    "the  experiment uses 344  fb@xmath32 of data  @xcite and , in contrast to belle , imposes tight selection criteria to reduce background as much as possible ( with a corresponding loss in efficiency ) .",
    "the most restrictive criterion is that events must have a @xmath25 decay fully reconstructed in the hemisphere opposite that of the semileptonic decay , where the modes @xmath13 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are used .",
    "this `` double - tagging '' eliminates copious background from real @xmath0 s combining with random @xmath57 tracks to make false @xmath22 candidates , but it reduces the signal efficiency by an order of magnitude . the neutrino momentum is determined via a neural network algorithm , and events are required to have decay times in the range 600 - 3900  fs ( corresponding to 1.5 - 9.5 @xmath0 lifetimes ) .",
    "a separate neural network is used to select signal events , and a final set of kinematic selection criteria are applied to the signal side .",
    "these criteria include cuts on the @xmath17 and @xmath38 momenta , and on the @xmath58 of the electron track in the silicon vertex tracker .",
    "the final candidate samples for ws data and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : semi_babar]a and [ fig : semi_babar]b , respectively . in the data ,",
    "three events are observed in the signal region @xmath59 , whereas the mc predicts ( for the luminosity of the data ) @xmath60 background events .",
    "together these values give @xmath61% , where the error corresponds to where the log - likelihood function for @xmath62 ( the true number of signal events ) rises by 0.50 units with respect to the minimum value .",
