    "in mason _ _ et al.__@xcite , we introduced a new interpretation of the probability flux operator @xmath0 by expressing its eigenstates as the limit of measurements by infinitesimally small coherent states .",
    "our approach yields a new perspective on flux measurements and provides a novel tool for visualizing wavefunctions which parallel the probability flux map .",
    "because they are based on the husimi projection technique@xcite , these visualizations are called husimi maps .",
    "husimi maps improve the understanding of the semiclassical paths underlying the quantum wavefunctions and can be of use even for systems where the traditional flux has little success ( i.e. , when it is either zero or strongly misleading ) .",
    "later work@xcite further developed the numerical framework of the husimi map and applied it to a wider variety of systems by incorporating local potentials and examining flux through open systems .",
    "this article expands the husimi map technique from continuous , free - particle systems like the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) to crystalline systems like graphene . while the extended wavefunction of an electron in a crystal is continuous , the potential imposed by the nuclei can be modeled by replacing the continuum with localized wavefunctions centered at individual tight - binding lattice sites .",
    "these individual wavefunctions combine to form a model of the entire wavefunction , which now defines their envelope function . in this model , eq .",
    "[ eq : flux - operator ] describes not the probability flow at an infinitesimal point , but the flow of probability in and out of the localized wavefunction at a single site .",
    "lattice systems can behave very differently from continuous systems .",
    "for instance , the orientation of the group velocity vector , which dictates classical dynamics , can strongly diverge from the wavevector , which was the initial foundation of the husimi projection .",
    "in fact , the group - velocity space can be so strongly restricted that classical trajectories are only permitted along certain directions , dramatically affecting the dynamics of states that inhabit lattice systems .",
    "when these trajectories hit a boundary , internal bragg diffraction can produce additional nonclassical ray reflections .    here",
    "we explore two - dimensional square and honeycomb lattices ; extension to three - dimensional systems is straightforward .",
    "honeycombs induce an additional phenomenon : the presence of multiple bands and valleys , by which different quasiparticles can propagate and interfere . while the flux operator is unable to reflect any of these behaviors , in this article",
    "we show that with proper modifications , the husimi projection can handle them with ease .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sub : husimi - projection ] we provide the definition of the husimi projection for continuous system and then modify the husimi projection in section [ sub : group - velocity - method ] to represent the group velocity and multiple bands . in section [ sub : billiard - eigenstates ] , we apply the husimi projection to square lattices near the band center where group - velocity effects are strongest , and in section [ sub : graphene - eigenstates ] , we examine the graphene honeycomb lattice .",
    "finally , in section [ sub : internal - bragg - diffraction ] , we provide an interpretation of unusual boundary reflections found in sections [ sub : billiard - eigenstates ] and [ sub : graphene - eigenstates ] by demonstrating and measuring internal bragg diffraction .",
    "building off work in husimi@xcite and mason _ _ et al.__@xcite , we define the husimi function as a measurement between a wavefunction @xmath1 and a coherent state @xmath2 , which minimizes joint uncertainty in spatial and momentum coordinates . for lattice systems ,",
    "the wavefunction represents the probability amplitude multiplier of localized wavefunctions indexed at discrete lattice sites , which are associated with discrete positions in the set @xmath3 .",
    "the coherent state is also an envelope function over localized wavefunctions , defined by the gaussian function @xmath4 centered around @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 defines the spatial spread of the coherent state and the uncertainties in space and momentum according to the well - known relation @xmath8 as a result , there is a trade - off for any value of @xmath7 selected : for small @xmath7 , spatial resolution is improved at the expense of resolution in momentum space , and vice versa for large @xmath7 .",
    "we can explicitly write out the projection of the wavefunction onto the coherent state as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the number of dimensions in the system . the husimi function",
    "is then defined as @xmath11 if we weight the husimi function by the central wavevector @xmath6 , we obtain the husimi vector .",
    "when momentum space is explored at a point by many husimi vectors , the result is the full husimi projection .",
    "if all the husimi vectors at a point are summed , the husimi function can be used to construct and generalize the flux operator , resulting in the vector - valued function @xmath12 equal to @xmath13 earlier work has shown that for @xmath14 , eq .",
    "[ eq : husimi - vector - old ] is proportional to the traditional flux vector expectation value @xcite . for lattice systems ,",
    "the traditional flux becomes a finite - difference approximation defined by the lattice .",
    "this paper examines hamiltonians using the nearest - neighbor tight - binding approximation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the creation operator at orbital site @xmath17 and we sum over the set @xmath18 of nearest neighbors .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is the on - site energy and @xmath20 is the hopping energy scale .",
    "for the square lattices , we set @xmath21 . for systems at energies",
    "@xmath22 , the tight - binding hamiltonian is a close approximation to the effective mass envelope function hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the mesh lattice spacing .",
    "for the honeycomb lattice , parameters are set to the common values in the literature for graphene : @xmath26 and @xmath27@xcite .",
    "eigenstates of closed stadium billiard systems are computed using the standard sparse matrix eigensolvers .      in the original introduction of the husimi map@xcite ,",
    "each husimi function is weighted by the wavevector of the coherent state to produce a visual guide to the classical dynamics of the system .",
    "summing all the vectors equates to the flux operator ( eq .  [ eq : husimi - vector - old ] ) when the coherent states are sufficiently small .",
    "this equivalence holds in lattices , however , the direction and magnitude of the group velocity @xmath28 can strongly diverge from the wavevector .",
    "since a coherent state , which is now defined as an envelope function over localized wavefunctions , follows the group - velocity vector instead of its wavevector , it is necessary to weight the husimi function by group - velocity vectors to indicate the classical dynamics . as a result ,",
    "the husimi projection indicates the classical flow of quasiparticles , in contrast to the flux operator ( eq .  [ eq : flux - operator-1 ] ) , which instead indicates the flow of probability .",
    "the two - dimensional dispersion relation for the square lattice demonstrates strong group - velocity warping at the band center ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "for example , at energies near the band center of @xmath29 , there are only four directions available to the group velocity in the square lattice , as shown in the solid white contour in fig .",

    "wavevectors are chosen with these angles to satisfy the dispersion relation for a given energy .    at energies away from the band center for",
    "the square lattice , semi - classical trajectories can assume any direction , but near the band center they must follow preferred directions determined by the group - velocity warping .",
    "however , the manner in which they do so may differ .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sunbursts ] which examines two cosine - wave states with different wavevectors .",
    "as the energy of the system increases from left - to - right , group - velocity warping draws husimi vectors , and the classical paths , towards four preferred directions .",
    "when the generating wavevector points along one of these directions , group - velocity warping merely sharpens the profile . when the generating wavevector points _ in between _ the preferred directions , as in the bottom row of fig .  [ fig : sunbursts ] , the classical trajectories are more strongly dependent upon the system energy .",
    "any expectation value over a wavefunction must be evaluated , usually by an integral , over a complete basis . as a result",
    ", any expectation value derived from the husimi projection must be first computed from the wavevector basis ; modifications to account for group velocity are determined afterwards .",
    "for instance , in the multi - modal algorithm , which approximates the full husimi projection by a subset of local plane waves ( see mason _ _ et al.__@xcite for more details ) , each approximation is achieved by computing the dot product between the husimi projection and template projections in @xmath34-space . because of group - velocity warping , the resulting wavevectors no longer indicate classical flow . to address this problem ,",
    "the resulting dominant wavevectors are then mapped onto group velocity by taking the local derivative of the dispersion relation .",
    "the number of bands for a lattice system is equal to the number of tight - binding orbitals in the unit cell@xcite .",
    "the square lattice has only one unique tight - binding orbital and only one band , but due to the warping in the band structure , distinct behaviors result at energies above @xmath29 , corresponding to the hole pocket ( see the contour lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion relation ] near the corners of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "however , because the quadratic dispersion relations at @xmath35 and @xmath36 are separated by energy , a semi - classical interpretation of a wavefunction is always constrained to one relation or the other .    like the square lattice in fig .",

    "but more interestingly , the band structure warps each band to produce the inequivalent @xmath39 and @xmath42 valleys at the dirac point , which are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion relation - graphene ] . unlike the square lattice ,",
    "these two valleys co - exist in the energy range @xmath43 .",
    "these valleys exhibit a linear dispersion relation near the dirac point@xcite . at energies away from the dirac point ,",
    "the two valleys undergo group - velocity warping that emphasizes three directions , which is referred to as `` trigonal warping''@xcite .",
    "the effects of trigonal warping can be significant even at energies as low as @xmath44 .",
    "the husimi map can assist visualizations of intervalley scattering , the scattering of quasiparticles between the two valleys which are part of the same band . to resolve the two valleys ,",
    "it is simply necessary that the uncertainty of the coherent state is small enough in @xmath34-space to unambiguously resolve the wavevectors of each valley . because the two valleys of graphene are well - separated and only come close at the corners of each triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion relation - graphene ] , the husimi projection can clearly resolve the two valleys at most energies .",
    "more complicated lattices can have additional bands , and any automated method for calculating husimi maps for these systems have to take their mutual distance in @xmath34-space into account .",

    "the husimi map for the higher energy eigenstate in fig .",
    "[ fig : billiard eigenstates]b instead _ only _ indicates classical trajectories along the @xmath52 diagonals .",
    "moreover , the trajectories in the higher - energy system are much clearer since they are reinforced by a restricted group - velocity space .",
    "the husimi map makes it possible to measure `` angular deflection '' , which reflects how classical trajectories deviate from the straight line in response to the system .",
    "angular deflection thus provides a map of where the boundaries or external potentials most strongly effect these dynamics , and can be interpreted as a force on the particle represented by the wavefunction .    for lattice systems , the original definition of angular deflection provided in mason _",

    "[ fig : billiard eigenstates ] shows angular deflection in blue , concentrated on the boundary as expected .",
    "because the resolution of angular deflection is limited by the spread of the coherent state used for husimi sampling , its spread into the bulk from the boundary exhibits the same gaussian distribution that is used for the test wavepacket .",
    "it is worth noting that without the proper modifications , angular deflection based on the wavevector shows non - trivial results in the bulk of the system even when there are no external fields .",
    "this also suggests that modifications may be in order for other metrics for lattice systems .",
    "for instance , by coordinating the boundary divergence with each wavevector , one can compute the quantum analog of a state s poincare map@xcite . in birkhoff coordinates@xcite",
    ", the angle of impact is mapped against a coordinate along the boundary , and both fully quantum@xcite and classical@xcite variations have become valuable tools in quantum chaos . by incorporating group - velocity considerations ,",

    "this causes the flux operator and eq .",

    "the same is true for the honeycomb lattice , except that the range of wavevectors available at low energies point towards the @xmath39 and @xmath42 valleys .",

    "if one examines the husimi projection for each valley individually , it is no longer true that each husimi vector is accompanied by its opposite .",

    "we have also shown that husimi projections can isolate multiple bands which are simultaneously represented in the wavefunction , using the two valleys of the honeycomb as an example .",
    "for the honeycomb lattice , we have shown that one can identify locations of scattering between valleys by measuring the divergence of the husimi map for each valley separately .",
