    "the quantum adiabatic theorem ( qat ) and its approximation ( qaa ) have been the backbone in many areas of quantum physics , namely , in condensed matter theory ( via the born - oppenheimer approximation )  @xcite , in atoms , molecules and quantum chemistry  @xcite , in quantum field theory via the gell - mann and low theorem  @xcite , and presently in the adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the theorem was first discussed by ehrenfest  @xcite , and later was formally derived by born and fock  @xcite and kato  @xcite .",
    "other modern proofs for qat can be found in refs .",
    "we refer the readers to refs .",
    "@xcite for thorough reviews on the development of qat .",
    "apart from the historical perspectives , comparat  @xcite have also proven the existence of two sufficient qat conditions for the oscillating schwinger hamiltonian .",
    "teufel - spohn  @xcite and avron - elgart  @xcite on the other hand , have provided the proof for the validity of qat for systems obeying the born - oppenheimer approximation , and for gapless systems , respectively .",
    "we will revisit the two conditions given by comparat to prove that these conditions are in fact equivalent to the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the respective external and internal timescales .",
    "subsequently , we will discuss how the new theorem proven here addresses the gapless system .",
    "due to numerous applications of qat in physics , a proper theorem with explicitly defined conditions is needed . here",
    ", we prove the existence of such a theorem , which can also be exploited to understand the origin of chemical reactions .",
    "to arrive at the standard qat for gapped system , we first let @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 to be the time - dependent hamiltonian , eigenfunction and eigenvalue , respectively , such that  @xcite @xmath6 and @xmath7 constitutes a complete orthonormal set that satisfies @xmath8 in which @xmath9 can be expressed as a linear combination @xmath10 with the phase factor @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we use @xmath13 and @xmath14 to denote the set of positive integers excluding zero and the set of real numbers , respectively . here , eq .  ( [ eq:77.2 ] ) is the general solution to the time - dependent schr@xmath15dinger equation @xmath16 therefore , one can show that if the initial hamiltonian , @xmath17 evolves very slowly to a new final hamiltonian , @xmath18 , then a particle that starts out in the @xmath19 eigenstate ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath17 is expected to occupy the ground state ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath18 .",
    "observe that the final eigenstate has non - trivially , picked up only a harmless phase factor @xmath22 in the above formulation , griffith used eqs .",
    "( [ eq:77.2 ] ) and  ( [ eq:77.3 ] ) to obtain the required coefficient ( in explicit form )  @xcite , @xmath23 that can be used to find out how slow the evolution should be , so that the initial particle still occupies the ground state of the new ( final ) hamiltonian . here ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the @xmath26 and @xmath19 eigenstate coefficients , respectively , such that @xmath27 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.5 ] ) , we can notice that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 exist at all times , and their eigenfunctions are orthogonal .",
    "this means that if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are degenerate at certain point of time , then eq .  ( [ eq:77.5 ] ) can not be used to derive the adiabatic criterion .",
    "the reason is that the gap that exists when @xmath30 does not exist for @xmath31 .",
    "now , assuming non - degeneracy , the qat criterion is given by @xmath32 which needs to be satisfied for one to exploit qaa .",
    "here , @xmath33 is the usual @xmath34-dependent eigenfunction for the @xmath26 eigenstate and @xmath28 is the @xmath34-dependent eigenvalue for the @xmath19 eigenstate , and the dot represents time derivative .",
    "there are two important assumptions associated to the original qat given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1 ] ) .",
    "first , there is no quantum phase transitions or chemical reactions when the initial quantum system evolves from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "secondly , the qat is only applicable for a two- or a multi - level system with well - defined energy gaps ( strictly no energy level crossings ) .",
    "for example , when one considers a two - level system for simplicity , then there exist two @xmath34-dependent eigenfunctions , observable at all times , and they are always nondegenerate and the two eigenvalues are @xmath28 @xmath37 @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , we can add as many eigenfunctions as we possibly could ( as denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , but we chose two , to keep the discussion straightforward .",
    "of course , later we will go through the examples with large number of energy levels and energy level crossings .    for the sake of argument however , if we assume that @xmath40 @xmath37 @xmath41 ( this is definitely different from @xmath42 @xmath37 @xmath43 , as described earlier ) then we can not apply the quantum adiabatic approximation [ given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1 ] ) ] simply because both of these eigenvalues ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) are not observable simultaneously .",
    "recall that @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40",
    "@xmath37 @xmath41 implies the energy gap ( @xmath45 ) in the form of @xmath46 .",
    "the energy gap in this form _ can not _ be defined as an energy gap because @xmath47 in other words , physically valid energy gaps must satisfy @xmath48 .",
    "later , we will show that @xmath49 can be associated to the possibility of a particle traveling forward and backward in time .",
    "now , it is also important to note here that if the external disturbances with a timescale , @xmath50 approaches @xmath51 due to @xmath52 , then one can not apply qaa .",
    "now , one should not be carried away into thinking that eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1 ] ) lacks a small parameter , which is required to understand the quantum adiabatic evolution . for example , the smallness is usually controlled by the dilation operator , @xmath53 such that @xmath54 . in our formalism however , this smallness is controlled by the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , without the need to introduce any _ ad - hoc _ control parameter _ by hand_. we will get to this point in detail in example 1 when we proof eq .  ( [ eq:77.7tex ] ) .",
    "the adiabatic criteria , @xmath55 and eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1 ] ) have been proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , without the proper definitions for these timescales .",
    "the existence of @xmath49 means that we are equating @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath33 with @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", we are referring to only one eigenfunction at all times such that @xmath57 evolves to @xmath58 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 may or may not be orthogonal to each other .",
    "if they are orthogonal , then one obtains @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "if they are not orthogonal , then @xmath49 does not exist .",
    "in addition to our arguments based on eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.7 ] ) , comparat  @xcite have also shown that the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1 ] ) is valid provided that the hamiltonian is real , gapped and non - oscillating .",
    "however , the generalized conditions derived there  @xcite , which are valid for any hamiltonian , do not consider gapless systems nor the hamiltonians that allow @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization .",
    "in addition , the internal and external timescales are also not properly taken into account .",
    "the @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization and large changes to the hamiltonians ( due to large external disturbances ) are essential because they can lead to continuous or second - order quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) during chemical reactions .",
    "the readers are referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for further details on the concept of qpt and its applications in strongly correlated matter .",
    "we anticipate that this continuous qpt proposed by sachdev  @xcite and senthil  @xcite can also occur due to the existence of energy level crossings due to large external disturbances , with or without the @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization , which could be the origin of any chemical reaction between two chemical species .",
    "this means that the energy levels of unreacted species must cross by overcoming the activation energies to form new compounds , and these new compounds ( if formed ) will have a new set of energy levels or bands .",
    "if the formed compounds are of non free - electronic systems , then there is a theorem based on the ionization energy theory that states@xmath59 the energy level spacing of such a system is proportional to their constituent atomic energy level spacing  @xcite .",
    "physically , this means that the energy level spacing of this newly formed compound is proportional to the energy level spacing of their constituent chemical elements .",
    "before we move on , let us first try to understand the concept of internal and external timescales in the qat .",
    "it is well known now that there are different versions of qats available for different applications as reviewed by teufel  @xcite , and avron - elgart  @xcite . however , all the existing qats are solely based on the scaled time , @xmath60 , @xmath61 $ ] , without explicitly referring to the internal and external timescales . in particular",
    ", @xmath62 here is independent of the internal timescale .",
    "the reason for this scenario is that there are no available equations to properly define @xmath1 and @xmath2 independently .",
    "anyway , the scaled ( dimensionless ) time , @xmath62 contains the dilation time or a time dilation operator , @xmath63 , such that @xmath63 allows us to slow down the time @xmath64 to obtain a slowly varying hamiltonian with respect to the value 1 ( when @xmath65 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath64 is the original ( unscaled ) physical time for the hamiltonian , and @xmath63 determines the dilation of this external physical time .    in the unscaled formalism ,",
    "we simply write @xmath1 to denote external timescale , to avoid confusion with @xmath34-dependence in @xmath3 and @xmath66 ( eigenfunction ) .",
    "otherwise , we will have to write @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and this notation will confuse the readers into thinking that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are not normalized to the real - space physical time , @xmath34 , or @xmath68 is from a different hamiltonian , and so on . as a consequence , we can see that the hamiltonian with scaled time , @xmath69 does not take the internal timescale into account , which can only be taken into account by defining the time variation in the wave functions or the eigenfunctions for a given @xmath69 .",
    "similar to @xmath62 , we can also define @xmath70 , where @xmath71 $ ] . in these scaled notations",
    ", @xmath72 refers to the original physical time of the wave functions , and @xmath73 determines the dilation of the internal physical time . here",
    ", @xmath74 is independent of the external timescale .",
    "again , in the unscaled formalism , we write @xmath2 to denote internal timescale .",
    "having understood the different notations used in the scaled and unscaled formalisms , we can now properly define the time , @xmath1 as the external timescale ( characteristic time for changes in the hamiltonian ) , while @xmath2 is the internal timescale ( characteristic time for changes in the wave function or eigenfunction ) . in order to understand the existence of these properly defined timescales",
    ", we do the following : we can define @xmath75 and write @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this normalization transforms @xmath69 back to @xmath3 , and the only thing left to do here is to find the inequality relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , this @xmath69 or @xmath3 still ignores the internal timescale ( because it is fixed as a constant ) , which leads to an important question@xmath59 how small should @xmath63 ( or @xmath1 ) be with respect to @xmath2 in order to violate the qaa ?",
    "this question means that we can not claim a given hamiltonian varies slowly if @xmath78 because we have to make sure @xmath73 does not go to @xmath79 when @xmath78 .",
    "we will prove here that the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 needs to be treated as a separate condition altogether .",
    "now we will discuss why the concept of quantum adiabaticity is correct , and why any violation that may exist only indicate the non - applicability of the qaa for certain systems .",
    "the existence of non - orthogonality in strongly interacting physical systems ( or non - linear quantum systems ) has been discussed by yukalov  @xcite as a result of non - linear terms in a given hamiltonian that destroys the adiabatic evolution .",
    "these non - linear terms can originate from various interactions such as electron - electron , electron - phonon , spin - orbit , spin - spin and so on , which may give rise to numerous energy - level crossings along the time line , @xmath34 .",
    "as anticipated , this means that we need to keep track of the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions with respect to time ( which will be explained in the subsequent sub - section ) .",
    "it is to be noted here that strongly correlated systems , including quantum dots and nanostructures ( non - free - electron systems ) do not form gapless systems .",
    "for example , the electrons and the phonons can not be decoupled , unless @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "any violation to a given qat means the existence of a non - adiabatic process , and this does not imply the qat is incorrect . violating the qat deliberately is important as a crosscheck because if the qat is violated for adiabatic processes , then the qat is either ( a ) not applicable for that process ( for example , applying gapless or gapped qat to a system that has time(@xmath34)-dependent orthogonalization ) , or ( b ) the said qat is insufficient ( again , this does not mean the concept of quantum adiabaticity is incorrect ) .",
    "consequently , deliberately violating a given qat can be used as a mean to crosscheck the correctness and sufficiency of the conditions given in a particular qat , as well as to have a deeper understanding of the conditions needed to guarantee the qaa , for example , with respect to the existence of self - orthogonality  @xcite .    here",
    ", we develop a new version of the qat that ( i ) allows @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization for each single eigenfunction as an additional condition , which can be used to explain the possibility of a particle traveling backward in time , ( ii ) allows to understand the origin of chemical reactions in the absence of , and in the presence of @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization , and ( iii ) gives a proper definition for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 and establishes the relationship between them as a valid and separate condition",
    ". points ( i ) to ( iii ) are the main results of this paper .",
    "in addition , we apply our theorem to degenerate energy levels due to energy level crossings to validate the qaa with properly defined @xmath1 and @xmath2 without invoking any rabi oscillation .",

    "in the discussion and proofs given above , we should not be falsely led into thinking that the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) imposes orthogonality . on the contrary , eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) allows the final eigenfunction to remain the same , or acquire some phase factors or be mathematically different from the initial eigenfunction , or even be different such that the final eigenfunction is orthogonal to the initial one .",
    "moreover , the proof for eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) also correctly exposes the intrinsic reason why we need to guess the eigenfunction , for instance , we have used the linear combination of the atomic eigenfunction in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.9 ] ) .",
    "in other words , we need to understand what is the mechanism involved , which gives us the license to rewrite @xmath269 as @xmath268 .",
    "well , of course @xmath268 is one of the acceptable solution to the hamiltonian that gives the lowest ground state energy .",
    "but we still lack the fundamental knowledge that enabled us to construct @xmath268 _ by hand_.    for example , we reconsider a h@xmath266 molecular ion such that the single electron molecular orbital , @xmath268 can be constructed , either from the molecular - orbital ( mo ) , or valence - bond ( vb ) theory  @xcite . in mo theory one uses the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) approach to construct the molecular orbital , namely , @xmath268 is constructed from the atomic orbitals of the type , @xmath269 . in this case , one immediately starts the construction in the molecular framework , meaning , in the presence of both h and h@xmath273 . in vb theory ,",
    "one still uses the atomic orbitals , but they are combined non - linearly  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in both cases , the constructions of @xmath268 are carried out in the molecular framework  @xcite , even though they are generated from the atomic orbitals in different ways .",
    "now , the chemical reaction between h and h@xmath273 , physico - chemically means that we are bringing two isolated atomic h and h@xmath273 ion closer from infinity , or they may come closer on their own due to some attraction between them via the coulomb interaction at finite distances . either way ,",
    "once they are close enough , and with sufficient external heat ( @xmath278 ) , but not higher ( than the h@xmath59h@xmath273 bond energy ) , the single electron in h can be excited ( or polarized ) to the highest possible atomic energy level and binds to the h@xmath273 ion , to form h@xmath266 . when one reads the above chemical reaction carefully , two intrinsic phenomena pop out that can be written as two statements .",
    "* statement 1 * : there is a change in the mathematical property of the wave function ( beyond the phase factor ) when @xmath269 for h transforms to @xmath268 for h@xmath266 .",

    "* statement 2 * : in both mo and vb theories , @xmath268 have been constructed based on the assumption that the chemical reaction has already taken place , since the construction of wave functions were carried out within the molecular framework .",

    "we have actually proven these two statements by proving the existence of the condition stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) .",
    "for example , we can observe that eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) correctly captures the effect of the chemical reaction by requiring an electronic phase transition ( due to wave function transformation ) , in which , the existence of this transition justifies why remark 2 is necessary",
    ". simply put , even though time is a continuous parameter , we can not construct a continuous @xmath34- or @xmath279-dependent eigenfunction for an electron that starts as an atomic orbital of an isolated atomic h that goes through an electronic phase transition to form h@xmath280 . here , @xmath279 denotes the @xmath34-dependent electron coordinate , which means , we do not require @xmath268 to be both @xmath281 and @xmath34 dependents explicitly .    as a consequence , just because @xmath268 can not be written as a continuous function of @xmath279 ( starting from isolated h and h@xmath273 , until the formation of h@xmath266 )",
    ", one should not assume that the above - stated wave function transformation ( or phase transition ) never took place , or should be ignored .",
    "the very moment we combine the atomic orbitals ( linearly or otherwise ) within the molecular framework proves the existence of this transformation , which we discovered from eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eq:77.1new ] ) also leads us to understand why the activation energy for the above chemical reaction exists@xmath59 because it is needed to initiate the wave function transformation ( non - observable ) or the electronic phase transition ( observable ) .",
    "this is consistent with the finite - temperature quantum phase transitions proven in ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , before we conclude , let us recall the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) arguments given by teufel  @xcite . here , eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new ] ) does not apply for an obvious reason@xmath59 a given wave function in a particular quantum system , that does not go through a quantum phase transition or @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization , does not transform beyond the phase factor with time .",
    "therefore , we just need to invoke eq .",
    "( [ eq:77.1new1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : x2 ] ) for such systems , which can be done within these well - known theories , mo , vb and the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "briefly , bo approximation is valid for as long as the electrons average kinetic energy equals , or larger than that of the ions , @xmath282 , which in turn implies @xmath283 and @xmath55 if @xmath284 .",
    "obviously , the above assumption does not violate eq .",
    "( [ eq : x2 ] ) , hence qaa is applicable .",
    "it is also true that repulsive interaction ( due to electron - electron interaction ) can be invoked to explain the existence of finite energy gap  @xcite , however , energy levels do cross due to `` lucky coincidences '' in many - body systems , as shown in example 3 . even in the presence of such coincidences",
    ", we can still check the applicability of qaa via eq .",
    "( [ eq : x2 ] ) .",
    "now , in the worst case scenario , we will have ( refer to example 3 ) @xmath285 then qaa seems to be not applicable .",

    "of course , mathematically one can construct the eigenfunctions such that @xmath289 and still satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : new ] ) .",
    "but this is like saying , we are attempting to invalidate qaa , solely for the purpose of violating qaa without any physical justification .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a new version of the quantum adiabatic theorem that takes the time - dependent orthogonalization into account , and even in the absence of this orthogonalization , we found that these ( with and without the @xmath34-dependent orthogonalization ) effects are very relevant to study the dynamics of chemical reactions .",
