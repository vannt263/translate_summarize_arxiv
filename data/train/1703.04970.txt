    "in this series of papers we take the perspective of open quantum systems ( oqs ) and examine from their nonequilibrium ( neq ) dynamics the conditions when the physical quantities , concepts , constructs and the time - honored laws of thermodynamics ( td ) become well defined and viable for quantum many body systems .",
    "we utilize one broad class of models where the nonequilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly  the brownian motion of strongly coupled ( sc ) harmonic oscillators , interacting strongly with a scalar field environment  to explore a range of basic issues in quantum thermodynamics ( qtd ) .",
    "the exact solutions possible in these oqss enable us to examine and define these conditions more precisely in a quantitative , systematic and transparent way .",
    "this approach hopefully compensates for the rather loose , qualitative and at times contrived way thermodynamic descriptions for quantum systems are proposed because of the need to adhere to the dictum of classical thermodynamics , which is valid only under very special conditions .    a clarification in the meaning and contents of quantum thermodynamics ( qtd ) @xcite might be useful before we proceed : to us , it is the study of the thermodynamic properties of quantum many - body systems ( mbs ) .",
    "quantum now refers not just to the particle spin - statistics ( boson vs fermion ) aspects  the rather limited meaning of ` quantum ' in traditional quantum statistical mechanics ( qsm ) , but also includes in the present era the quantum phase aspects , such as quantum coherence , quantum correlations and quantum entanglement .",
    "this is where quantum information has a hand in qtd @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics connotation can be extended to include systems not necessarily in equilibrium at all times , thus encompassing dissipative and relaxation processes for systems deviating from equilibrium , including linear or nonlinear response theories applied to quantum mbs  , familiar in condensed matter or chemical physics and for classical mbs , topics incorporated in the traditional field of neq td  @xcite .",
    "these considerations can be extended to weakly nonequilibrium conditions but not for far - from - equilibrium , fully arbitrary time evolutions .",
    "that is when an open quantum system treatment becomes necessary .",
    "the issues addressed in this first paper encompass the nature of internal energy , heat capacity and the third law for a fully nonequilibrium ( neq ) system .",
    "we demonstrate what it takes for it to evolve to an equilibrium ( eq ) condition , and from that point establish the connection with traditional td theory .",
    "the conditions for traditional td theory to be well - defined and operative for a classical or quantum system are very specific despite its wide ranging applicability : a system of relatively fewer degrees of freedom in the presence of a thermal bath of a huge number or infinite degrees of freedom ( we shall consider only heat but no particle transfer here and thus the td refers only to canonical ensembles ) , the coupling between the system and the bath is vanishingly small , and the system is eternally in a thermal equilibrium state by proxy with the bath which is impervious to any change in the system  .",
    "this also involves new challenges at zero or very low temperatures when quantum features become prominent , challenges posed by non - markovian environments and in the treatment of non - markovian dynamics . by virtue of its ability to provide a first principles derivation of noise from quantum fluctuations ( e.g. , for gaussian noise via the feynman - vernon identity , instead of being put in by hand ) , and linking fluctuations and noise with dissipation and relaxation by dynamical relations ( such as the fluctuation - dissipation relation which can be traced to the unitarity in the original closed system before one coarse grains the environment to a description of mean field dynamics and its fluctuations ) , the open quantum system approach is also a natural setting for incorporating stochastic thermodynamics @xcite , which has seen a wide range of chemical and biological science applications .",
    "the set - up : in our opinion , the neq dynamics of open quantum systems , e.g. , in the tradition of feynman - vernon , caldeira - leggett _ et al _ @xcite even though requiring more work , is the preferred setting for addressing _ new issues in quantum thermodynamics for future challenges _  .",
    "this is in comparison with a popular set - up which has been studied more in the literature namely , that of a global thermal state ( cgts ) assumed for the combined or closed system ( c ) = system ( s ) + bath ( b )  . in the cgts set - up",
    "the initial and final states of c are the same , namely the combined system remains in a equilibrium global thermal state , because the dynamics of the combined closed system is unitary .",
    "this is visibly closest to the setting of thermodynamics and thus naturally convenient for exploring small extensions of thermodynamics .",
    "by contrast the open system neq ( oneq ) approach deals with time evolution of the open system .",
    "it requires the specification of the initial conditions and the derivation of the late time behavior of the open system . for those systems that upon interaction with a bath equilibrate at late times",
    ", one may then connect its behavior with the descriptions of thermodynamics .",
    "for sure this is a many - to - one relation - many different initial conditions can produce the same final steady / equilibrium state , or that there is no common final steady / equilibrium state .",
    "a lot depends on the structures of the system , the properties of the bath and the way they interact .",
    "all the above mentioned factors need to be considered for interacting quantum many - body systems before we construct thermodynamical quantities , address thermodynamical issues and invoke ( or hasten to claim success in revoking @xcite ) the well - established thermodynamical laws .",
    "we will elaborate on their differences in a subsection below .",
    "there are three main components in this paper :    \\1 ) set - up and conditions : the physical differences of the set - ups , comparing our open system nonequilibrium ( oneq ) approach ( level 2 ) with traditional td ( level 0 ) on the one hand , and with the global thermal ( cgts ) state set - up ( level 1 ) on the other . in td , as mentioned above , the system - bath coupling has to be vanishingly small whereas in both the level 1 and 2 treatments the system - bath coupling can be strong .",
    "we will mention the cgts approach as many existing work is based on this setup , but focus more on how to use an open system approach to define and quantify quantum thermodynamics . in a companion paper @xcite we will attempt to build some bridges between these two approaches , via generating functional and reduced density matrix formulations .",
    "the hope is that from the open system perspective , one may be able to identify which entities and concepts are more suitable for treating new problems in qtd and which are residues of the old which may hinder new developments .",
    "other authors using an open system approach to quantum thermodynamics include duarte and caldeira @xcite who treated a coupled - oscillator system by the influence functional method , carrega _ et al _ @xcite who treated a two level system via moment - generating functionals , and esposito _ et al _ @xcite using nonequilibrium green s functions .",
    "\\2 ) model with exact solutions : we use a quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) model of harmonic oscillators with strong - coupling both within the system ( @xmath1 ) and interacting with a scalar field bath ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the merit of this model which represents a rather broad class of physical problems is that being a gaussian system it can yield exact solutions which enable us to cross - examine the relevant issues leaving little room for speculation .",
    "even when familiar quantities like energy and entropy can be defined in different ways under different conditions , since we are treating neq dynamics , if we make precise specific conditions , these quantities are defined .",
    "there is no worry about ambiguity .",
    "the results from this model study are used for addressing the following issues :    \\3 ) issues and consequences :    a. energy extensivity : thermodynamic functions are well defined under the conditions when thermodynamics theory is viable , namely , that the system is very weakly coupled to the bath , the bath being a passive source which provides a temperature parameter , not a dynamical variable which can back - react on the system .",
    "it is a meaningful question to ask if the nice properties we are accustomed to in conventional thermodynamics , e.g. , the extensive property of internal energy will still hold for strongly interacting quantum systems . in the model we studied here we answer this question in the affirmative ,",
    "that the internal energy remains extensive under strong coupling .",
    "b. heat capacity : from the internal energy we calculate the heat capacity and examine its behavior toward @xmath3 .",
    "we find a power law , not an exponential decay .",
    "this has significan implications .",
    "this aids us to address a version of the third law and to resolve some puzzles raised in the literature such as the claimed negative specific heat near absolute zero even in well behaved systems @xcite .    c. third law .",
    "there are several formulations and statements of the third law .",
    "we approach it from the behavior of the heat capacity near absolute zero , which aids us to resolve some puzzles raised in the literature such as the claimed negative specific heat near absolute zero even in well behaved systems @xcite , and address some concerns expressed by hanggi , ingold , talkner , weiss _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "d. vedral _ et al _ @xcite invoked heat capacity as an indicator of entanglement , and raised the issue of how the entanglement at a system s ground state bears on the third law . for the ( spin ) system they studied they made the claim that  the validity of the third law of thermodynamics relies on quantum entanglement \" . using the behavior of the heat capacity at @xmath3 we derived here , combined with our earlier results on the entanglement between two coupled oscillators interacting with a zero temperature bath @xcite",
    ", we show that this is not the case at least for the coupled oscillator system .",
    "there is no connection between entanglement in the system and the third law .",
    "e. the oneq approach we adopt for the dynamics of the system provides means to calculate entropy production , but not before the meaning and definition of entropy for interacting quantum systems can be understood and clarified .",
    "we say this because even the most commonly invoked von neumann entropy has problems if not used and understood properly .",
    "we shall mention this issue at the end of this paper but leave a proper treatment of heat , entropy , entanglement , and from it the first and second law , to the second paper @xcite in this series .",
    "we begin by stating a few basic facts connecting the three levels of treatments : level 0 thermodynamics ( td ) , level 1 closed system ( system and environment combined ) in a global thermal state ( cgts ) and level 2 open system evolving to an equilibrium state ( oneq ) .",
    "a. traditional statistical mechanics treats many body systems in thermal ( canonical distribution ) and chemical ( grand canonical ) equilibrium .",
    "the starting point of quantum statistical mechanics ( qsm ) is probability density , no quantum phase information is invoked .",
    "this is encoded in _ the two fundamental postulates of quantum statistical mechanics _ : equal a priori probability to all accessible states and random phase approximation .",
    "thus from a quantum information viewpoint , the system of interest to qsm is already fully decohered in the energy basis and behaves classically in an effective way ",
    "what is quantum in qsm only pertains to quantized energy levels and particle spin - statistics .",
    "b. partition function is well defined only for systems in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it _ is ill - defined for systems under nonequilibrium conditions when the notion of temperature is lacking .",
    "_ pathologies may ensue if it is forced upon even perfectly normal systems ( in contradistinction to systems for which the canonical ensemble does not exist and the heat capacity is negative in the microcanonical ensemble , such as gravitating systems ) . as noted in @xcite",
    "if one proceeds from assuming that the combined system + environment is in a thermal state the behavior of the heat capacity of the system is different when it is derived from the energy of the central system at equilibrium or from a partition function approach @xcite . by examining the open system nonequilibrium dynamics with no reference to the partition function one",
    "never encounters these pathologies .",
    "likewise , old notions such as _ the hamiltonian of mean force @xcite are only meaningful in the conceptual framework of equilibrium systems _ @xcite as in cgts .    c. the oft - heard statement ,",
    "that the generating functional ( in quantum field theory ) is equal to the partition function ( in equilibrium statistical mechanics ) is true only for thermal fields , i.e. , there exists a canonical distribution where a thermal state is well defined for all times .",
    "this statement arises from treating thermal ( finite temperature ) fields with imaginary ( matsubara ) time quantum field theory . _",
    "if one uses real time representation to describe the neq dynamics of open systems the generating functional remains well defined but it is not the ( canonical ) partition function defined in imaginary time .",
    "_    d. if an open system upon interaction with its environment can equilibrate at late times , and if it is further thermalized , it enters a thermal state . but",
    "this equilibrium state is different from that of a system in contact with a heat bath which behaves in a totally passive and non - dynamical way , in particular , with no backaction on the system .",
    "the latter is where a theory of quantum thermodynamics is often constructed , namely , from a simple extension of conventional classical thermodynamics .",
    "the difference lies in the dynamical correlations between the system and the bath , which conventional thermodynamics ignores completely by assuming a vanishingly small coupling .",
    "e. as for the differences between oneq and the cgts setups , there are important physical consequences .",
    "let us illustrate this with a simple model calculation from the ubiquitous qbm .",
    "below we use an illustrative calculation based on the ubiquitous quantum brownian motion to drive home this important point .    consider a system of an harmonic oscillator bilinearly coupled to an environment consisting of harmonic oscillators , also referred to as the quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the combined system is : @xmath4 where the variables in capital are associated with the system , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the mass and the oscillating frequency of the system oscillator .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the coupling strength between each bath mode @xmath8 and the system oscillator @xmath9 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are their respective conjugate momenta .",
    "such a combined system is sufficiently simple to serve our current purpose .",
    "at some initial time @xmath12 the system and environment are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "moreover , the environment is in the thermal state with respect to its isolated hamiltonian @xmath13 : @xmath14 in the above equation @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "if the environment is very large and the system - environment coupling is such that the system relaxes to a unique steady ( or equilibrium ) state irrespective of the initial state , we call the environment a thermal reservoir or a heat bath . under these assumptions of equilibration it has been shown that @xcite the unique steady ( or equilibrium ) state @xmath16 has the form : @xmath17\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is defined analogous to @xmath19 above , and @xmath20 is the reduced state of the system , evolved out of the initially uncorrelated global state .",
    "this state is referred to as the equilibrium state to distinguish it from the thermal state given by the boltzmann - gibbs distribution with respect to the system hamiltonian alone .",
    "it is important to note that although the system relaxes to the equilibrium state , the global state of the system+environment is not in equilibrium .",
    "in particular , @xmath21 the density matrix @xmath22 here is the state of the combined system and environment , evolved from the initial state ; thus @xmath23 .",
    ".   is true because the thermal state of the combined system+environment is a stationary state of the full hamiltonian and thus can not be reached from a nonstationary state under hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "what says is that the reduced system state is consistent with a global thermal state and that no further information about the nonequilibrium state of the combined system+bath can be obtained if one has access to the system only . in other words the information on the non - equilibrium state of the combined system+environment is not stored in the system but rather in the environment and in the correlations between the system and the environment .    to demonstrate this point , we focus our attention to a single bath mode .",
    "the solutions to the equation of motion are : @xmath24 + \\frac{p_k(t_i)}{m_k \\omega_k}\\ , \\sin[\\omega_k(t - t_i ) ] + \\int_{t_i}^t ds\\ ; \\frac{\\sin[\\omega_k(t - s)]}{m_k \\omega_k}\\ , g_k\\ , q(s)\\ , , \\\\",

    "@xmath26 as @xmath27 .",
    "this is the reason why the system can not keep any of the memory of its initial state .",
    "however , since the closed system dynamics is unitary , that information is not lost .",
    "rather , it is distributed over the bath modes .",
    "the first two terms in the expression for @xmath28 do keep the memory of the initial thermal state of the bath .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the important observation is that although @xmath25 and @xmath30 are decaying functions , the above integrals are oscillatory .",
    "( this can be seen explicitly by choosing @xmath31 ( ohmic case ) and doing the integrals explicitly . ) as a result , the information on the initial state of the system survives forever in the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly , information on initial state also survives in the correlations between the system and bath modes as can be seen by studying the late - time limit of @xmath32 .",
    "however , the coupling to each mode is extremely small under the assumption of equilibration , and this makes it practically impossible to extrat this information in reality .    under the assumption of equilibration ,",
    "the reduced system relaxes to the equilibrium state at late times , irrespective of the initial state of the system . as a result",
    "any thermodynamic formulation that only relies on the reduced state of the system for its definitions , will be independent of the initial state of the system .",
    "moreover , all the information about the reduced state of the system can be obtained by assuming a global thermal state without introducing any errors .    in the weak coupling limit , @xmath33",
    ", the equilibrium state approaches the thermal state .",
    "but in general , the equilibrium state differs from the thermal state .",
    "it is common to define the so called `` hamiltonian of mean force '' to quantify this difference .",
    "in essence , hamiltonian of mean force is the operator with respect to which the equilibrium state has the boltzmann - gibbs form , where the temperature is that of the bath .    in conclusion ,",

    "b ) however , the final global states are different , despite the fact in both cases the dynamics is generated by the same hamiltonian ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is because two global systems start out with different initial states , and the unitary evolution does not change the distinguishability between the states .",
    "c ) note that in the cgts set up , even though the closed system is assumed to be in a global thermal state , the system is not necessarily in a thermal state .",
    "one needs extra assumptions , such as the system is very weakly coupled to the bath .",
    "it is under the same condition that the open system can reach thermalization .",
    "one should be mindful of these presumptions when comparing the thermal states in both setups .",
    "we mention these facts as a cautionary note to remind ourselves and for those who want to compare quantities calculated in these three different setups .",

    "when this coupling is finite , we may instead understand the extensive property of the internal energy in terms of the normal modes of the coupled oscillators .",
    "we have shown that with this definition of extensivity the internal energy becomes extensive after the system reaches equilibrium , as implied by .",
    "it is interesting to note that the degrees of freedom of the oscillators used to describe the extensive property of the internal energy are neither the original degrees of freedom associated with each oscillator , nor the modes that decouple their equations of motion .",
    "rather they are the degrees of freedom that diagonalize the oscillation frequency matrix @xmath35 . in this regard ,",
    "the extensive property of the internal energy in the final equilibrium state is the same as that of coupled oscillators in conventional thermodynamics , that is , in the vanishing system - bath coupling limit .",
    "this offers an explicit theoretical justification , from the open - system viewpoint , of conventional thermodynamics when applied to such a many - body system .",

    "our view is that the third law depends on the nondegeneracy of the ground state manifold and has nothing to do with entanglement directly .",
    "indeed it has been shown @xcite in the case of two spatially separated but coupled oscillators in a zero - temperature shared bath that the equilibrated state of this two oscillator system is not always entangled .",
    "for example , with sufficiently strong oscillator bath interaction , the reduced state of the two oscillators is separable .",

    "the requirement that @xmath341 and @xmath335 are positive matrices implies that @xmath370 is indeed a retarded green s function and @xmath324 does not have any pole along the real axis of @xmath220 and on the upper half of the complex @xmath220 plane .",

    "thus , even merely using the uncertainty principle argument , one can see that these quanta are highly nonlocalized , distributed over the whole configuration space .",
    "by contrast for harmonic oscillators , the ground state and the excited states of each bath oscillator are essentially confined by the corresponding harmonic potential @xmath394 .",
    "thus the higher the value of the natural frequency @xmath395 is , the more localized the corresponding mode .",
    "the difference between a field and a collection of harmonic oscillators shows up , for example , when there is a spatial boundary present . the boundary will modify the mode functions of the field and alter the two - point functions of the bath to recognize the effects of the boundary .",
    "it is not obvious how this boundary - induced spatial dependence can be naturally implemented in the bath - oscillator model .",
    "additional complexity emerges when the system contains more than one oscillator which are spatially separated from one another , since the @xmath371-oscillator bath model does not have the dynamical degrees of freedom to register the locations of the spatially - separated constituent oscillators in the system unless extra input of the spatial information of the system constituents and how it enters in their interaction with the bath is provided .",
    "more often than not , one simply ignore the spatial distances between the system constituents by assuming that this separation is so small that we can essentially view them as being situated at the same spatial location or by taking the dipole approximation .",
    "this creates a causality problem . for relativistic quantum fields , the influence of an object at one spacetime point on another object at another spacetime point is effected by the former s imprint on the field , which propagates causally to the latter when it begins to exert its influence .",
    "the dynamics of the latter will in turn trigger a new disturbance , on top of the previous one it received , in the field , which propagates at finite time and exerts its influence on the motion of all the other components .",
    "this field - induced interaction among the spatially separated components of the system depends on the history of its constituents and is thus fundamentally non - markovian in nature ( see , the plots in e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notably this causal propagation feature is mostly lacking in the oscillator - bath mode if the spatial information of the system constituents is not properly accounted for  . the field - bath model being relativistic",
    "naturally incorporates the spatial correlation and respects the causality .",
    "as a preamble we bring up the rather special conditions whereupon the foundation of thermodynamics is laid , from an open system perspective : a small open system interacting with a vast environment ( whose thermal properties can be captured by a few physical parameters , its temperature , chemical potential ) , it is in the limit of vanishing coupling between them , only when the system can equilibrate and thermalize at late times , that thermodynamics makes sense .",
    "these considerations can be extended to nonequilibrium conditions but not for far from equilibrium , fully arbitrary time evolutions .",
    "we mentioned the important differences in the setups for treating quantum thermodynamics ( qtd ) , namely , between level 1 assuming the closed system ( comprising the system and its environment ) remains in a global thermal state ( which we call cgts ) and level 2 an open system approaching equilibrium at late times ( we call it oneq ) , which is the preferred approach we adopt for the discussion of lvel 0 .",

    "the absence of such a state for open quantum systems severs the linkage to thermodynamics .",
    "qtd in the form described here does not exist for these systems .",
    "\\1 ) the internal energy for certain strongly bounded systems may not be straighforwards to define ( e.g. , the presence of self energy as when gravity is involved ) but fortunately not so in the model we studied : it is the sum of the kinetic energy of each oscillator , the harmonic potential energy , and their coupling energy .",

    "we are concerned with a ) low temperature behavior , b ) the positivity and c ) the extensivity of heat capacity .",
    "\\3 ) the internal energy and the heat capacity for a system consisting of only one harmonic oscillator have been derived before in the cgts setup  @xcite .",
    "they are derived here in an open quantum system oneq setup , which in the epoch after equilibration , can be compared , in the weak osc - bath coupling limit , with the quantities derived in the cgts and in the conventional thermodynamics .",
    "they all agree with each other .",
    "\\4 ) complexity arises when the system has more than one constituent .",
    "the bath - induced non - markovian effects can not be properly described in conventional thermodynamics .",
    "this also brings in question the validity of energy extensivity because the system constituents are not only directly coupled ( which is easy to deal with by normal mode separation ) but are indirectly coupled or intertwined in a non - markovian way by the induced interaction through their common environment .",
    "\\5 ) with the proven existence of an equilibrated state for @xmath0 spatially separated but mutually coupled system oscillators we have shown that even a strongly coupled system can still have asymptotic extensivity of the internal energy , and the heat capacity remains positive as long as the motion is stable .",
    "\\6 ) to compare results calculated in the three different levels , cgts , oneq and conventional thermodynamics , we need to beware of their respective regimes of validity and identify their common denominators , e.g. , the common physical quantities and the states they are in .",
    "we work here with an open system oneq set up , namely , we allow the system to evolve from a nonequilibrium initial state to a final equilibrium state .",
    "if the system thermalizes then the results obtained in the oneq setup can be compared to results in conventional thermodynamics , as we did . since the reduced density matrix of the oneq after equilibration and that of the system in the cgts setups",
    "are the same  @xcite , the results from these two setups can be compared using this quantity .",
    "for the same system we have studied here there are claims of negative heat capacity in variance to our findings .",
    "e.g. , the author of @xcite working with a global thermal state cgts setup claims that the heat capacity of the system of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators can be negative at low temperatures for 1 ) stronger system - bath interaction , or 2 ) smaller number of system constituents .",
    "however , we have demonstrated under rather general conditions that after the system reaches equilibration , the heat capacity of the system is always positive and approaches zero , for the full range of system - bath interaction strength .",
    "thus the third law , from the aspect of low - temperature behavior of the heat capacity of the system , is not violated .",
    "our findings of the extensivity of the energy and the positivity of heat capacity for @xmath0 coupled oscillator system should hold in all three levels of inquiry .      in ref .",
    "@xcite wieniak _",
    "_ have  shown that the low - temperature behavior of the specific heat can reveal the presence of entanglement in bulk bodies in the thermodynamical equilibrium \" .",
    "they drew this conclusion by showing that the heat capacity is an entanglement witness for some spin models .",
    "this involves finding a lower bound on heat capacity that can be achieved by separable states of the system .",
    "the third law requires the heat capacity to approach zero asymptotically with the temperature .",
    "this means that at low enough temperatures the behavior of heat capacity is not compatible with separable states , and is thus an indicator of entanglement .",
    "here we find that specific heat is not a reliable indicator of entanglement for our model .",
    "we see no requirement that the zero temperature state is always entangled . for vanishingly weak coupling to the bath the system relaxes to its ground state at zero temperature , which is entangled due to the coupling among system oscillators .",
    "however , for strong system - bath coupling the system relaxes to a mixed state at zero temperature ( the equilibrium state ) and the entanglement among system oscillators can vanish . in this state",
    "the system oscillators get entangled with the bath oscillators , which in turn can undermine the entanglement among system oscillators .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the monogamy of entanglement .    at the same ,",
    "we have shown that the third law is valid for our model in all parameter regimes .",
    "there is no connection between the third law and entanglement . moreover , even in the models / parameter regimes in which this connection exist , we do not interpret this observation as the third law relying on quantum entanglement .",
    "the third law stands . the claim that the third law implies the existence of entanglement",
    "could well be affected by the use of entanglement witness as a criterion .    [",

    "we have focused on the internal energy and heat capacity of the system , but not heat , which is the energy transfer between the system and the environment .",
    "this is because heat transfer as energy change contains ambiguities in an open system context .",
    "for example esposito _",
    "et al _ @xcite found that any heat definition expressed as an energy change in the reservoir energy plus any fraction of the system - reservoir interaction is not an exact differential when evaluated along reversible isothermal transformations , except when that fraction is zero . even in that latter case",
