    "lead chalcogenides ( pbs , pbse , pbte ) are iv - vi narrow gap semiconductor compounds with rock salt crystal structure . in nanocrystalline form",
    "these materials manifest superior optical and electrical properties which opens a wide field of applications .",
    "their small gap ( 280 - 410 mev at room temperature@xcite ) , a large exciton diameter ( e.g. , @xmath1 in pbs and @xmath2 in pbse @xcite ) and small effective electron and hole masses make them a good medium for optoelectronics , photovoltaic devices and quantum confinement studies  @xcite .",
    "an infrared diode laser was constructed  @xcite based on pbse / pbeute quantum dots .",
    "recent studies  @xcite indicate that pbse nanocrystals might be good candidates for high - efficient solar cells . because of impact ionization ( an electron - hole pair with large energy decays into several electron - hole pairs with lower energy ) ,",
    "efficient carrier multiplication occurs .    in order to fully understand the de - excitation of hot carriers - in particular ,",
    "the ratio of radiative versus non - radiative decay channels and the mechanisms of line broadening - it is necessary to learn more about the electron - phonon coupling in lead chalcogenides . while high - quality calculations of the electronic bands are available ( ref .   and references therein )",
    ", the understanding of the phonon dispersion of the lead chalcogenides is much less complete .",
    "experimentally , phonon dispersion relations of pbs , pbse , and pbte were obtained by inelastic neutron scattering measurements @xcite .",
    "simulations of the phonon dispersions have been done so far mainly on the level of the semi - empirical shell model @xcite .",
    "all three materials exhibit the same anomalies in the dispersion relation : a strong softening of the to ( transverse optical ) phonon branch around @xmath0 and an unexpected dip of the lo ( longitudinal optical ) branch at @xmath0 .",
    "the to softening is due to the near - ferroelectric character of the lead chalcogenides  @xcite ( in a truly ferroelectric material , this mode would acquire a complex frequency , i.e. , the fcc structure would no longer be the most stable one ) .",
    "different explanations were proposed for the lo dip .",
    "cowley and dolling attributed the dip to screening by free carriers in the crystal . a term for free carrier doping",
    "was consequently introduced in the recent semi - empirical phonon calculations by upadhyaya et al .",
    "maksimenko and mishchenko  @xcite explain the lo dip by the dipolar pseudo - jahn - teller effect  @xcite .",
    "recent _ ab - initio _ calculations of the phonon dispersions of pbs , pbse , and pbte @xcite displayed a minimum of the lo mode at @xmath0 which ( for pbse and pbte ) turned into a strongly pronounced dip when spin - orbit coupling was taken into account .",
    "the reason for the strong dip enhancement remained open .",
    "we present in this paper a systematic _ ab - initio _ study of the three phonon dispersion relations of the lead chalcogenides . the small gap and the near - ferroelectric behavior demand a careful choice of calculation parameters such as sampling grid and pseudopotentials .",
    "our calculations reproduce quantitatively the acoustic modes .",
    "the anomalies of lo and to modes are qualitatively reproduced in the calculations ( since they are strongly temperature dependent @xcite , anharmonic effects would have to be taken into account in order to quantitatively reproduce the measurements which were performed at room temperature ) .",
    "our calculations show that a pronounced lo dip is present in the pure materials even without free carrier doping .",
    "we explain this dip in analogy to the kohn anomalies @xcite that occur in the semi - metal graphene @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that _ ab - initio _ calculations can reproduce very well the specific heat of pbs and compare with recent calculations @xcite that include the effect of spin - orbit effects .    in section [ details ]",
    "we summarize the computation method and give the details of the calculations . in section [ dispersion ]",
    "we discuss the dispersion relations of the three lead chalcogenides .",
    "section [ cvsec ] presents data on the specific heat in comparison with experimental data . in the appendix",
    ", we show that the electronic k - point sampling must be dense enough around the high - symmetry point l in order to reproduce the lo dip at @xmath0 .",
    "in the harmonic approximation , the phonon frequencies ( as a function of the wave - vector @xmath3 ) are obtained from the equation @xmath4 the dynamical matrix @xmath5 corresponds to the force on atom @xmath6 in direction @xmath7 linearly induced by a displacement of atom @xmath8 in direction @xmath9 .",
    "we calculate it with density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite as implemented in the code abinit @xcite .",
    "we use the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "the wave - functions are expanded in plane waves .",
    "core electrons are replaced by pseudopotentials .",
    "we found that the phonon frequencies are very sensitive to the choice of the lead pseudopotential .",
    "in particular , it is important to include the lead 5d semi - core electrons as valence electrons in the calculation .",
    "( this is different from the case of pure lead , where the 5d electrons do not alter the phonon frequencies significantly @xcite ) .",
    "the reason lies in the strongly ionic character of the lead chalcogenides : the lead atoms tend to transfer the 6p valence electrons to the anions .",
    "it is then the overlap of the remaining 6s and 5d electrons of lead with the 3p orbitals of the anion that determines the covalent part of the pbx bond ( where x stands for the anion s , se , or te , respectively ) .",
    "since the 5d orbitals contribute to this bonding , their density should be calculated explicitly and not be substituted by a pseudopotential .",
    "we tested different troullier - martins pseudopotentials created with the fhi pseudopotential generation code @xcite .",
    "we verified that the corresponding fhi potential for lead and the chalcogens from the abinit web - page yielded converged results for the phonon frequencies .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff is 40 ha .",
    "it has been observed for ferroelectric materials that _ ab - initio _ phonon calculations give better agreement with experimental data if they are performed at the experimental lattice constant , rather than the lattice constant obtained by total energy minimization ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "the reason is that the lda tends to underestimate the lattice constant and in ( near ) ferroelectric materials even a small underestimation of 1% strongly influences the ferroelectric instability .",
    "our phonon calculations are performed using the experimental lattice constants at 300k .",
    "the experimental lattice constant are given in table  [ latconsttable ] together with the values of the optimized lattice constants . since anharmonic effects are neglected ( and very difficult to include on an _ ab - initio _",
    "level @xcite ) , we do not expect to fully reproduce the temperature dependence of the phonon dispersions .",
    ".calculated lattice constants in comparison with experimental lattice constants @xcite at 30 k and at 300 k. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that the lo dip is considerably less pronounced in our calculated phonon dispersion of pbte .",
    "this is due to the strong overestimation of the gap of this material @xcite ( see table [ gaptable ] for our values obtained on the dft - lda level and a comparison with the experimental values ) . at this point",
    ", we have to discuss if the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) leads to an improvement of the phonon - calculations .",
    "it has been shown by hummer et al .",
    "@xcite that soc strongly reduces the electronic gap for the three lead chalcogenides .",
    "e.g. , for pbte , the gap is reduced to 60 mev .",
    "the inclusion of electron - correlation effects , e.g. , on the level of the gw - approximation , is needed in order to `` re - open '' the gap and to obtain values in good agreement with the experimental gaps @xcite . for the calculation of the lo - dip",
    "this means that inclusion of soc does not necessarily yield better results ( unless electron - correlation effects are properly taken care of at the same time ) : the underestimation of the gap leads to an overestimation of the lo dip .",
    "such an effect can be seen , e.g. , in the pbte phonon dispersion of romero et al .",
    "( fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "we note that a recent _ ab - initio _ calculation of cardona et al .",
    "@xcite yielded considerably higher phonon frequencies for pbs than the experimental data .",
    "this is due to two reasons : they use the optimized lattice constant @xmath10 which underestimates the experimental lattice constant at 30k by 1.7% and the room temperature lattice constant by 2.2% .",
    "furthermore , their use of a pseudo - potential with the lead 5d electrons in the core may lead to different phonon frequencies . including soc ,",
    "leads to a general softening of the phonons and improves the agreement with experimental data @xcite ( except for the lo dip at @xmath0 ) .",
    "our calculations with the experimental lattice constant at 300 k are in very good agreement with the acoustic branches of the experimental dispersions .",
    "inclusion of soc would probably lead to less agreement .",
    "the optical phonons are in worse quantitative agreement with the experimental data points than the acoustic modes . in particular , for the to mode around @xmath0 , strong deviations occur .",
    "this is not surprising , since our calculations take into account temperature effects only through the choice of the room temperature lattice constant while phonon renormalization through phonon - phonon interaction  @xcite is neglected within the harmonic approximation .",
    "due to the near - ferroelectricity , the renormalization of the to mode as a function of temperature will be particularly strong .",
    "e.g. , the model calculation by maksimenko and mischenko  @xcite predicts for pbte that the to mode at room temperature stiffens by about 15 @xmath11 with respect to its value at 4k .",
    "another test of the quality of our _ ab - initio _ phonon calculations is the comparison with available experimental data for the specific heat , @xmath12 , of pbs , pbse , and pbte @xcite .",
    "the specific heat depends on the phonon densities of states , @xmath13 , ( right panels of figs .",
    "[ pbsdisdos],[pbsedisdos],[pbtedisdos ] ) .",
    "we calculate it numerically through the formula @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 is the avogadro constant .",
    "note that @xmath13 is normalized to 6 , i.e. , the number of phonon branches .",
    "the resulting specific heat as a function of temperature is plotted in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ cvfig ] .",
    "all three curves display the typical convergence towards the petit and dulong value @xmath17 for a material with two atoms in the primitive cell .",
    "following the discussion of cardona et al.in refs .  , we also display @xmath18 in the low temperature regime ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ cvfig ] ) .",
    "all three curves display a maximum between 8 and 12 k.    the agreement between the experimental and theoretical height of the maximum of @xmath18 was used in ref .   as a critical test for the quality of the _ ab - initio _ phonon calculations .",
    "they obtained a maximum height of the _ ab - initio _ curve at 1160 @xmath19j / molk@xmath20 while the experimental height is at 1520 @xmath19j / molk@xmath20 .",
    "the deviation was tentatively assigned to the absence of soc in the calculations .",
    "recently , it was shown for elemental bismuth @xcite and antimony @xcite that inclusion of soc in the phonon calculations leads to a lowering of the acoustic modes and thus to an increase of the maximum @xmath18 . also for elemental lead ,",
    "a lowering of the acoustic modes through the inclusion of s - o coupling has been observed @xcite .",
    "since our dispersion relations have been calculated with the room temperature lattice constants , we expect that we underestimate the frequencies of the acoustic phonons at very low temperature ( where the lattice constant shrinks and the inter - atomic force constants stiffen )",
    ". consequently , our computed @xmath18 for pbs should overestimate the measured one .",
    "[ cvfig ] ( blue dashed line ) shows that this is indeed the case : we obtain the maximum @xmath18 at 1750 @xmath19j / molk@xmath20 . for a better assessment of the specific heat at low temperature",
    ", we have repeated the calculation of the phonon dispersion and the dos using the pbs lattice constant at 30k ( see table  [ latconsttable ] ) . the resulting @xmath18 ( solid black line in fig .",
    "[ cvfig ] ) is in excellent agreement with the measured data . for pbse ,",
    "the agreement with experiment is also fairly good .",
    "however , in the case of pbte , the specific heat calculated with the phonons at the low temperature lattice constant is somewhat lower than the experimental data .",
    "consequently , spin - orbit coupling ( which has a stronger effect in pbte than in pbse and pbs @xcite ) might be needed to yield good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "further calculations of the phonon dos including soc effects ( and the 5@xmath21 electrons of pb in the valence ) are needed to resolve this issue .",
    "we have calculated the phonon dispersion relations for lead chalcogenides .",
    "strict convergence parameters ( concerning the lead pseudopotential and the k - point sampling ) enabled us to obtain good agreement with experimental dispersion relations and measurements of the specific heat .",
    "the acoustic phonon modes are reproduced almost exactly .",
    "the pronounced dip of the lo mode at @xmath0 is related to the narrow band gap and can be understood as a near kohn anomaly .",
    "this work provides the starting point for the investigation of electron - phonon coupling in nanocrystals of lead - chalcogenides .",
    "we would like to thank c. delerue , j. serrano , m. cardona , a. romero , x. gonze , and m. verstraete for stimulating discussions .",
    "funding was provided by the french national research agency through project anr pjc05_6741 .",
    "calculations were done at the idris supercomputing center , orsay ( proj .",
    "for most semiconductors , a 4@xmath224@xmath224 or 6@xmath226@xmath226 ( shifted ) monkhorst - pack k - point sampling of the electronic structure is sufficient to reproduce the phonon dispersion , including the lo / to splitting at @xmath0 for polar materials . in this appendix",
    ", we show that for lead chalcogenides a much higher sampling is needed to properly reproduce the lo mode dispersion around @xmath0 .",
    "[ samplingfig ] shows the lo mode dispersion close to @xmath0 for different n@xmath22n@xmath22n monkhorst - pack samplings .",
    "we used here a troullier - martins pseudopotential with the 5d electrons in the core ( from the abinit web - page ) .",
    "this allowed us to go to very high k - point samplings .",
    "the phonon frequencies marked by the symbols have been obtained by directly calculating the dynamical matrix for the corresponding phonon wave - vector ( avoiding interpolation of the dynamical matrix ) . obviously , it makes a big difference if @xmath23 is even or odd . for @xmath23",
    "even , we obtain higher frequencies and for @xmath23 odd , we obtain lower frequencies than in the limit @xmath24 . the difference between the 7@xmath227@xmath227 and the 8@xmath228@xmath228 sampling amounts to more than 40 @xmath11 for the lo mode at @xmath0 ! ( for the to mode - not shown here - the corresponding difference is less than 3 @xmath11 . ) even between the 19@xmath2219@xmath2219 sampling and the 20@xmath2220@xmath2220 sampling , there remains a difference of 2 @xmath11 for the lo mode ( while the to mode is converged to within 0.03 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the origin of the even - odd discrepancy for the different k - point samplings lies in the electronic structure of the lead chalcogenides which all have a very small direct gap at the high - symmetry point l. the small gap is ( among other factors ) responsible for the very high dielectric constants ( @xmath25 ) of the lead chalcogenides .",
    "the point l is included in the samplings when n is odd , but not when n is even .",
    "we noticed that response - function calculations with odd samplings tend to strongly overestimate @xmath26 while the even samplings underestimate it .",
    "the link between the dielectric screening and the lo / to splitting is given by eq .",
    "a variation of @xmath26 due to insufficient k - point sampling will strongly influence the lo mode frequency while the to mode frequency may already be converged . since @xmath26 occurs in the denominator , overestimation of @xmath26 in an odd sampling",
    "leads to underestimation of the lo mode frequency .",
    "since a calculation of the full dispersion relation with a very dense monkhorst - pack grid ( and with the 5d electrons in the valence ) was not feasible , we used a nested ( 7,3 ) grid .",
    "this is a 7@xmath227@xmath227 mp grid where , in addition , the cubic volume element around the point",
    "l is sampled by a simple 3@xmath223@xmath223 grid .",
    "the high k - point density around l corresponds thus to the density in a uniform 21@xmath2221@xmath2221 grid and the solid line in fig .",
    "[ samplingfig ] demonstrates that we obtain the lo frequency in very good agreement with the 20@xmath2220@xmath2220 and 19@xmath2219@xmath2219 samplings .    due to the pronounced dip",
    ", the calculation of the dispersion relation from a fourier - interpolated dynamical matrix is therefore not feasible for the lo mode around @xmath0 .",
    "this is the reason , why in our dispersion relations ( figs .",
