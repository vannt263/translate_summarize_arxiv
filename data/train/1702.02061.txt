    "in the last years , several models of opinion dynamics were studied in order to analyze social phenomena like polarization , extremism , conformity , and others @xcite .",
    "indeed , social systems are interesting even from the theoretical point of view : they exhibit rich emergent phenomena , that results from the interaction of a large number of agents .",
    "this interdisciplinary topic is usually treated by means of computer simulations of agent - based models , which allow us to understand the emergence of collective phenomena in those systems .",
    "the impact of conformity / nonconformity in opinion dynamics has attracted recent attention of the physicists @xcite .",
    "nonconformity behaviors like anticonformism or independence , that are introduced in opinion models as disorder or noise , lead to the occurrence of phase transitions , making the models more realistic since distinct opinions can coexist in the population , as occurs usually in referendums and elections @xcite .",
    "the independent behavior was discussed recently in opinion models @xcite .",
    "independent individuals tend to resist to the groups influence , taking your own opinions regarding a subject independent of the other individuals .",
    "independence is a kind of nonconformity , and it acts on a opinion model as a kind of stochastic driving that can lead the model to undergoes a phase transition .",
    "in fact , independence plays the role of a random noise similar to social temperature @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the impact of independence on agents behavior in a kinetic exchange opinion model defined on regular d - dimensional lattices . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a probability @xmath0 of agents to make independent decisions . in the absence of noise the population reaches consensus with all agents sharing one of the extreme positions .",
    "our numerical results suggest that the model undergoes phase transitions at critical points @xmath2 that depend on the lattice dimension .",
    "these transitions are of order - disorder type , presenting the same critical exponents of the ising model within error bars .",
    "the results also suggest that the upper critical dimension of the model is @xmath3 , as for the ising model .",
    "the organization of the work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic rules that define the model . in section 3",
    "the numerical results are discussed for the model defined on dimensions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
