    "the potential equations may be used to classify motions in the same manner as in the case of perfect fluids [ 6,7 ] .",
    "the simplest case is for fluids of grad 2 ( or thermocapillary fluids ) : the internal energy is a function only of the density , the entropy and their first spatial derivatives @xmath6 and @xmath7 adds little except for complications in the momentum balance equation .",
    "if we consider flows through liquid - vapour interfaces and use convenient physical units , the equations of thermocapillary fluids are able to study non - isothermal motions and yield a possible interpretation of film boiling phenomena [ 8,9 ] .",
