    "light compound nuclei ( cn ) formed in low energy ( e / a@xmath215 mev / nucleon ) heavy - ion reactions are highly excited and carry large angular momenta .",
    "the compound systems so formed decay by emitting multiple light particles ( n , p , @xmath11 ) and @xmath12-rays , which in the statistical hauser - feshbach ( hf ) analysis is understood as an emission process from the equilibrated cn , resulting in cn fusion cross sections . apparently , the decay process must depend on temperature and angular momentum dependent potential barriers  @xcite . for light compound systems with @xmath13 ,",
    "the above noted light - particles ( lp ) emission is always accompanied by intermediate mass fragments , the imfs of z@xmath32 and 4@xmath2a@xmath220 , also called `` complex fragments '' or `` clusters '' , whose contribution , though small of the order of 5 to 10% , is to be included in the cn fusion cross sections . then , the temperature- and spin - dependent potentials must also be mass - asymmetry dependent . in other words ,",
    "the structure effects of the compound system also become important .    in order to understand the imf production , not only the hf analysis",
    "is extended to include the fragments heavier than @xmath11-particle in the busco code @xcite or in the extended hauser - feshbach scission - point model @xcite , but also other statistical fission model descriptions  @xcite have been used that are based on either the scission - point or saddle - point configuration , in the gemini code @xcite or the saddle - point `` transition - state '' model ( tsm ) @xcite , respectively . the lp emission in these fission models",
    "is still treated within the statistical hf method .",
    "it is interesting to mention that light - nucleus emission can also be qualitatively well described in the framework of a generalized rotating liquid - drop model , proposed recently by royer and collaborators @xcite .",
    "since the measured angular distributions and energy spectra of emitted complex fragments are consistent with fission - like decays of the respective compound system , the fusion - fission process is now well established in light dinuclear systems  @xcite .",
    "the statistical fission models , for which the fission - decay of a cn is determined by the phase space ( level density ) available at the saddle - point  @xcite ( or scission - point  @xcite ) configuration , may however lack in terms of not including more explicitly the structure effects of the compound system .",
    "large structure effects have been shown to be important in the @xmath14ni compound system through a strong resonance behaviour  @xcite of the excitation functions of large - angle @xmath15si+@xmath15si elastic and inelastic scattering yields  @xcite . although neither similar resonant effects nor orbiting processes  @xcite have been evidenced in the @xmath7s+@xmath8 mg reaction  @xcite studied here , a fully dynamical theory for more complete description of the emission of both the lps and imfs in the framework of the statistical model of the decay of such a hot and rotating nuclear @xmath14ni system",
    "remains highly desirable .",
    "a recent attempt towards the dynamical treatment of the decay of a hot and rotating nucleus is the work of gupta and collaborators @xcite , where a dynamical collective clusterization process is proposed as a possible alternative of the fission process .",
    "both the lps and imfs are considered as the dynamical mass motion of preformed fragments or clusters through the barrier .",
    "note that , in terms of the barrier picture , a cluster - decay process is in fact a fission process with structure effects of the cn also included via the preformation of the fragments , but without any phase space arguments ( i.e. with no level density calculations ) .",
    "alternatively , the dynamical fission process has been considered by some authors @xcite simply as a continuous deformation of the cn @xcite .",
    "the above noted dynamical cluster - decay model ( dcm ) of gupta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is so - far used to calculate the decay constant and total kinetic energies ( tkes ) of imfs alone , and that too in a re - normalization procedure only . in other words ,",
    "only the angular momentum @xmath16=0 ( s - wave ) solution and tke for fixed @xmath16-value are considered . in this paper",
    ", we develop the dcm further for the calculation of actual ( summed up , `` total '' @xmath16 ) cross sections and the average total kinetic energies @xmath17 for both the emitted light particles and complex imfs .",
    "interesting enough , the light particles , though treated within the same dynamical collective clusterisation process , are found to possess different characteristic properties .",
    "brief reports of the present work have recently been presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the data for imfs chosen here , to apply the dcm , are those of the @xmath7s+@xmath8mg@xmath18ni@xmath19 reaction , where the mass spectra for a = 12 to 28 fragments , and the average total kinetic energy ( @xmath10 ) for only the most favored ( enhanced yields ) @xmath11-nucleus fragments , are measured at two incident energies @xmath20 = 121.1 and 141.8 mev , or equivalently at @xmath9 = 51.6 and 60.5 mev , respectively @xcite ( only even - even fragments are observed for @xmath9 = 51.6 mev ) . in this experiment , by detecting both fragments in coincidence , it was possible to deduce the primary mass distribution for the decay process i.e. the mass distribution before the occurrence of the secondary light - particles emission from the fragments .",
    "these primary , pre - evaporation mass distributions show that the mass - asymmetric channels are favored over the symmetric ones , with @xmath11-nucleus , a=4n , fragments having enhanced yields .",
    "the imf emission cross section , estimated in one of these experiments @xcite , is @xmath21 mb .",
    "the cn fusion cross section data due to multiple lp emission at these energies are also deduced later from the same experiment @xcite , and as quoted in @xcite , are @xmath22 and @xmath23 mb , respectively , at @xmath9 = 51.6 and 60.5 mev , which fit the other available earlier measurements at similar and other energies for this system @xcite .",
    "the total fusion cross section is then the sum of this cross section due to the lp emission and the fission - like imf emission cross section .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section ii gives briefly a description of the dcm for hot and rotating light - mass nuclei .",
    "the model is presented for the emission of both the lps and imfs .",
    "the calculations are presented in section iii .",
    "the discussion of our results and a summuary constitute section iv .",
    "the dcm for hot and rotating nuclei is a reformulation of the preformed cluster model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators for ground - state decays in cluster radioactivity ( cr ) and related phenomena @xcite .",
    "thus , like pcm , dcm is also based on the dynamical ( or quantum mechanical ) fragmentation theory of cold fusion phenomenon in heavy ion reactions and fission dynamics @xcite , including the prediction of cr @xcite .",
    "this theory is worked out in terms of : + ( i ) the collective coordinate of mass ( and charge ) asymmetry ( h and l stand , respectively , for heavy and light fragments ) @xmath24 @xmath25 and ( ii ) relative separation r , + which in dcm characterizes , respectively , + ( i ) the nucleon - division ( or -exchange ) between outgoing fragments , and + ( ii ) the transfer of kinetic energy of incident channel ( @xmath9 ) to internal excitation ( total excitation or total kinetic energy , txe or tke ) of the outgoing channel , since the fixed @xmath26 ( defined later ) , at which the process is calculated , depends on temperature t as well as on @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 .",

    "the individual contributions of imfs are illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , for the @xmath107 emission and the @xmath132 emission .",
    "we notice that the contributions of the lighter imfs towards @xmath5 are much larger than that for heavier imfs .",
    "this result is consistent with the observation of an asymmetric mass distribution , which is favored .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same results ( as presented in figs . 6 and 7 ) can be obtained in the statistical fission model calculations for this reaction ( see , for example , fig .",
    "14 in @xcite ) .",
    "the noticeable difference is that , in the statistical fission model @xcite , @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) also reduces to zero at @xmath129 , which is due to the chosen phase space ( the sharp cutoff approximation ) in that model .",
    "another point of interest to note in dcm is that the so - called promptly emitted lps are really not that prompt but they do have a considerable overlap with the binary - decay process ( of cluster emission ) for the higher @xmath16-values .",
    "this is also consistent with the statistical fission model of @xcite .",
    "it is true that lp emission starts early but continues along with the emission of imfs till the decay process itself stops for @xmath135 .    before giving the quantitative comparison of @xmath4 and @xmath5 calculations with experimental data ,",
    "we study here the role of changing @xmath56-value and the nature of emitted light - particle(s ) .",
    "8 shows the results of dcm with the use of different @xmath56-values for the lps and imfs , taking @xmath136 fm for lps , but keeping the same @xmath56=1.28 fm ( as in fig .",
    "6 ) for imfs .",
    "we notice that the magnitude of ( total @xmath16-summed ) @xmath4 reduces considerably ( by a factor of about 2 ) where as @xmath5 remains nearly the same ( rather an increase by about 20% can be observed ) . furthermore , if we also change the proton - emission to neutron - emission , as in fig .",
    "9 , the @xmath102-value remains the same , but the magnitude of @xmath4 reduces further to about 60% , keeping the @xmath5 almost unchanged .",
    "these results in figs . 8 and 9",
    "are to be compared with the respective measured values of @xmath4=1050 mb and @xmath5=60 mb .",
    "the agreement for @xmath5 can be further improved if the @xmath16-values are summed only upto the point where @xmath88 ; then the calculated @xmath5=103 or 106 mb in fig . 8 or",
    "9 , respectively .",
    "note that the drastic reduction of @xmath4 in fig .",
    "9 occurs because the lower @xmath16-values ( @xmath137 ) also do not contribute to the lp emission cross section .",
    "it is known for experiments that it is more difficult to evaporate a neutron than a proton , as is also shown to be energetically the case in fig .",
    "2 . however , we do not make a search for the exact emission of lps , since we do not attempt a one - to - one comparison with the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the general success of dcm is demonstrated here for the first time to give the lp emission in a non - statistical formalism .    the total cross section @xmath138 for decay of @xmath14ni@xmath19 at @xmath9951.6 mev to light fragments @xmath106 ( for both the lps and even - a , n = z imfs ) is plotted in fig .",
    "10 for the case of fig . 8 , and compared with other calculations based either on the saddle - point transition - state model ( tsm ) @xcite or on the scission - point model , the so - called ehfm scission - point model @xcite , and available experimental data @xcite for @xmath139 imfs .",
    "the tsm calculations for lps are performed within the hf formalism @xcite , and hence are the same for ehfm model @xcite .",
    "the ehfm calculations for imfs are done for @xmath14012 fragments and are thus joined straight from @xmath1414 to @xmath14112 . only even -",
    "a fragments are plotted since the imf - spectra at @xmath9951.6 mev is measured for only even - a fragments @xcite . for the lp emission at this energy , as already stated above , the measured ( fusion or evaporation residue ) cross section is available ( @xmath142 mb ) but the separate yields for each emitted lp is not given for a possible direct comparison between the experiment and model calculations .    in fig .",
    "10 , we can notice that the known discontinuity at the point between @xmath1414 and 6 in both tsm and ehfm calculations , due to the use of hf formalism for lps ( @xmath1434 ) , is no more present in the present dcm calculations .",
    "the dcm treats both the lps and imfs emission in a similar manner , although the present calculations ( corresponding to the case of fig . 8) overestimate @xmath4 by a factor of more than two .",
    "this discrepancy in dcm is mainly due to the contribution of mass - one - particle , here the proton .",
    "for example , the replacement of proton with neutron ( fig .",
    "9 ) yields the calculated @xmath4 to be in better agreement with the data .",
    "apparently , for the calculation of the evaporation residue cross section @xmath4 or @xmath144 , it is very important to know exactly the contributing particles ( i.e. their multiplicities ) for comparisons with experiments .",
    "note further that the hf analysis gives nearly equal cross sections for each of the four emitted particles ( @xmath106=1 - 4 ) , whereas a decreasing function of the light - particle mass is obtained in dcm .",
    "it will be of high interest to measure the lp s trends in the near future .    for the imfs , in fig .",
    "10 , the general comparison between the experimental data and dcm is of the same quality as for the tsm or ehfm , at least for @xmath145 . for @xmath146 the tsm and ehfm predictions appear to be better .",
    "note that in dcm calculations @xmath56=0.41 fm for lps and @xmath56=1.28 fm for imfs .",
    "however , a closer comparison of dcm calculations with experiments ( fig .",
    "12 , discussed below ) favors the use of a fragment - dependent @xmath56 or the actual @xmath147 , calculated from @xmath54 , presented in fig .",
    "11 for light mass fragments .    in fig .",
    "11 , we notice that @xmath147 has an oscillatory nature , if compared to the smooth variation of @xmath51 or @xmath148 with @xmath27 .",
    "the maxima in @xmath147 correspond to @xmath11-nuclei imfs and the minima to n = z non-@xmath11-nuclei imfs , with the odd-@xmath106 fragments lying in between . for light - particles , the @xmath147 values increase almost monotonically . in any case , the division between the lps and the imfs is clearly evident from the variation of @xmath55 with @xmath27 .",
    "figure 12 shows the dcm calculations for use of different average @xmath56-values and the actual @xmath147 obtained in fig .",
    "11 from calculated @xmath54 .",
    "these calculations are presented here only for even - a imfs .",
    "we have also added here the dcm calculations for @xmath56=1.28 ( from fig .",
    "it is clear that @xmath56=1.28 fm gives the optimum fit to imf data , though the oscillatory nature of data is almost smoothed out , particularly for the heavier imfs .",
    "interesting enough , this oscillatory structure of the cross section gets restored with the use of actual @xmath147 obtained from calculated @xmath54 , though the fit with data is now deteriorated . apparently , an improvement in @xmath147 is required .",
    "this calls for an improvement in the calculations of @xmath54 and hence in the ground - state and t - dependent binding energies .    the histograms in fig .",
    "13 show the comparisons of the absolute imf cross sections for the best fit ( @xmath56=1.28 ) , the experimental data @xcite and the two alternate model - calculations of tsm @xcite and ehfm @xcite , for @xmath139 at both the available energies .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "14 shows the dcm calculated excitation functions ( cross sections at different @xmath9 ) for the emission of @xmath95 from the excited @xmath6 cn .",
    "we notice in fig .",
    "14 that , independent of the choice of @xmath56-value ( i.e. a constant or t - dependendent value ) , the @xmath95 emission cross section , @xmath149 , increases as the incident energy increases and reaches a maximum around @xmath9 = 90 mev and then starts to decrease at higher incident energies .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar results are obtained in the hf calculations , using busco code , for the emission of @xmath95 from @xmath150 cn @xcite . from figs .",
    "13 and 14 it is clear that the dcm contains the required features of the experimental data , as well as of other models ( ehfm  @xcite and tsm  @xcite ) .",
    "a better treatment of the binding energies and missing aspects , such as the deformations of the fragments and neck formation between them , would also ameliorate the predictions of the present model . in view of this hope , in the following , we further analyze the comparisons of the dcm calculations for average @xmath10s with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure 15 shows the dcm calculated average total kinetic energy @xmath151 compared with the experimental data for the @xmath7s+@xmath8 mg reaction @xcite leading to hot @xmath14ni@xmath19 at the two chosen energies . here",
    ", for each fragment , the tke for each @xmath16 is averaged over its corresponding production cross section @xmath152 _ w.r.t . _ the total cross section @xmath153 .",
    "we have also calculated the total kinetic energy @xmath154 for a best fit to the @xmath16-value . apparently , the comparisons with data are reasonably good for both the calculations and it is difficult to distinguish between the calculated @xmath155 and @xmath10 .",
    "the maximum @xmath16-value is nearly the same in both case .",
    "however , it is not clear why this maximum @xmath16-value is much less than the @xmath102-value .",
    "the simple model - dependence used for handling the deformations of the fragments and neck formation between them need further improvements .",
    "we have further developed the dcm for the decay of a hot and rotating cn , formed in light heavy - ion reactions , into multiple lp evaporation and imf emission .",
    "the lp emission ( evaporation residue ) cross section @xmath4 , constitutes the cn fusion cross section @xmath156 for a negligible emission of imfs , since @xmath157 , also referred to as @xmath131 . the statistical equilibrated cn evaporation process , successfull for the emission of lps , could not explain the imf emission .",
    "alternatively , the imf emission alone could be understood as the statistical fission process in the saddle - point  @xcite or scission - point model @xcite . on the other hand , in dcm ,",
    "both the lps and imfs are treated identically as the dynamical collective mass motion of preformed fragments or clusters through a barrier , i.e. quantum mechanical tunnelling of clusters that are considered pre - born with different probabilities before they actually penetrate the barrier .",
    "thus , the cluster preformation probabilities contain the structure effects of the cn , that are found to be important in the description of the measured excitation functions of large - angle elastic and inelastic scattering yields in the experiments under study .",
    "the dcm is worked out in terms of only one parameter , the neck - length parameter , that depends on the total kinetic energy of the fragments tke(t ) at the given temperature t of the cn , which itself is defined for the first time in terms of the binding energies of the emitted fragments in their ground - states and the binding energy of the hot cn .",
    "the hot cn is considered to achieve its ground - state by giving away its extra binding energy to the emitted lps , which is shown to leave the emitted imfs in their respective ground states with total kinetic energy tke(t=0 ) .",
    "the remaining ( excitation ) energy txe(t ) must go in to the emission of secondary light - particles from the imfs which are otherwise already in their ground - states in the radial motion .",
    "such an emission of secondary light - particles is not included here in the dcm so - far ; rather the model predictions are compared with the primary imf experimental data @xcite , corrected for such an emission .",
    "the dcm is applied here to the decay of @xmath6 , formed in the @xmath7s+@xmath8 mg reaction at two incident energies @xmath9= 51.6 and 60.5 mev , where both the lp cross section and imf spectra , as well as the total average kinetic energy ( @xmath10 ) for only the favored @xmath11-nucleus fragments , are measured @xcite",
    ". the interesting result of dcm is that both the preformation factors and penetrabilities , as a function of angular momentum , behave differently for the lps and the imfs . in other words",
    ", there is an explicit division at mass - four fragment between the lps and imfs with @xmath120 belonging clearly to the lp regime .",
    "the preformation factor is shown to contribute more to the observed behaviour of imf cross section @xmath5 , which can be compared with the experimental data reasonably well , favoring an asymmetric distribution .",
    "furthermore , the variation of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 with angular momentum , as well as the individual contributions of imfs to @xmath5 , and the excitation functions of the emitted imfs , match exactly the predictions of the statistical fission model , and the hf analysis .",
    "since , unlike fission models , the dcm does not depend on the chosen phase space it has the advantage that the @xmath83-value is fixed by the initial conditions of the experiment via @xmath102 , rather than by the available phase space .",
    "this distinguishing feature is evident in @xmath5 not going to zero when @xmath4 goes to zero at @xmath114 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath4 , however , depends strongly on the type of particles involved and their multiplicities , as expected .",
    "the calculated @xmath10 also reproduces the experimental data , though at an @xmath158-value , which has perhaps to do with the way the deformations of the fragments are included here simply through the same neck - length parameter that accounts for the temperature effects .",
    "the model is being improved both for the neglected deformation effects and neck - formation between them as well as the binding energies used to calculate this neck - length parameter .    the financial support from the department of science and technology ( dst ) , and the department of atomic energy ( dae ) , govt .",
