    "as the centre  of  mass energy of an e@xmath3e@xmath4 collider is increased , measurements of the photon structure function , @xmath5 , can be extended into two new kinematic regions .",
    "a preliminary study  @xcite has shown that a 500 gev e@xmath3e@xmath4 linear collider with a luminosity of 10 fb@xmath7 per year provides sufficient hadronic gamma - gamma events with a tagged electron or positron to give good statistics at both high @xmath8 ( 10@xmath9 gev@xmath10 ) and low bjorken-@xmath6 ( @xmath11 ) . events at high @xmath8 would allow for the qcd test of the linear rise of @xmath5 with @xmath12 .",
    "the high statistics at small @xmath6 presents the possibility of observing whether @xmath5 behaves in the same way as the proton structure function i.e. increasing as @xmath6 decreases .",
    "it is also the region in which theoretical predictions of @xmath5 differ significantly .",
    "however , lep measurements have since demonstrated that measuring @xmath5 at low-@xmath6 is not trivial  @xcite and requires a good knowledge of the hadronic response of the forward region detectors , in addition to having an electromagnetic calorimeter at small angles for tagging .",
    "this is also true of the future e@xmath3e@xmath4 linear collider ( lc ) detector .",
    "the measurement of the low-@xmath6 behaviour of @xmath5 is not trivial for the following reason . in the singly  tagged regime ,",
    "the determination of @xmath6 requires both the @xmath8 of the probe photon ( measured from the tag ) and the invariant mass , @xmath13 , of the hadronic final state ( measured from the particles other than the tag ) .",
    "however , the visible invariant mass is less than the true invariant mass mainly due to losses in the beam pipe and poor hadronic acceptance in the forward regions .",
    "this results in increasing the reconstructed @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) and therefore the @xmath6 distribution has to be corrected by an unfolding procedure to obtain @xmath5 .",
    "this unfolding heavily relies upon information , both before and after detector simulation , from the monte carlo that is used to model the tagged two  photon process .",
    "the critical point is that this monte carlo must correctly model the final state , so that the particle losses are properly accounted for .",
    "if an unfolding monte carlo has final state particles that are more forward  going than the ones in the data events , the unfolding procedure can falsely increase the result at small @xmath6 ( and correspondingly decrease it at high @xmath6 ) and even introduce a false low-@xmath6 rise into a result . clearly , the analysis of the hadronic final state is vital to the low-@xmath6 analysis .",
    "the energy flow of the final state relative to the tagged electron ( or positron ) has been introduced  @xcite and was used to demonstrate that the presently available tagged @xmath0 monte carlos do not model the lep data very well  @xcite , even in the central acceptance .",
    "this results in uncertainties at low-@xmath6 that are too large to be conclusive about the existence of a low-@xmath6 rise .",
    "the herwig  @xcite generatorgrv leading order , beamsstrahlung photon spectrum _ not _ incorporated .",
    "] has been used for this generator level study to produce tagged @xmath0 events corresponding to lep1 and lc beam energies ( 45.6 and 175 gev respectively ) . for each tagging region considered , every final state particle ( other than the tag ) has been entered into a histogram corresponding to its pseudorapidity ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 is the polar angle of the particle measured from the direction of the beam that has produced the target photon ) using the particle energy as a weight .",
    "the resulting ` energy flow ' distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : flows ] , and are true energy distributions without the loss of energy due to acceptance effects .",
    "the histograms are energy flows _ per event _ corresponding to @xmath17 events ( solid line ) and @xmath18 events ( dashed line ) .",
    "the following cuts were made : @xmath19 gev ( above charm threshold ) ; @xmath20 ( n.b . changes with beam energy ) ; @xmath21 mrad . the cross  sections after the cuts are shown in table  [ tab : xsec ] .    .cross",
    " sections for each beam energy and tagging region after the cuts described in the text .",
    "note that requiring a minimum invariant mass reduces the cross section in the @xmath22 mrad range at @xmath23 gev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the shapes of the energy flow distributions are quite similar for the different beam energies considered .",
    "this is an important observation as it means that the progress and conclusions of the lep studies of @xmath5 , especially at low-@xmath6 , are almost directly applicable to the lc analysis .",
    "it is already known that herwig generates the final state particles more forwardly than the lep data  @xcite , but nevertheless the distributions are a reasonably good approximation to those those expected at the lc ( assuming beamsstrahlung does not alter these energy flow distributions too much ) .",
    "if the shapes are so similar under a change of beam energy , then those seen at beam energies of 45.6 gev and 175 gev indicate what those at higher beam energies might be like .",
    "there are two vital components to a low-@xmath6 @xmath5 measurement at the lc .",
    "the first is having the small angle tagger ( lcal ) to measure the low angle tags , and hence the low-@xmath6 events .",
    "this also maintains tagging continuity in @xmath8 from lep to the lc  @xcite .",
    "the second is to constrain the final state models of the @xmath0 monte carlos with the data . to do this",
    ", one must understand the hadronic response of the whole detector very well , especially the mask ( if it is to be instrumented ) and the lcal .",
    "this would provide vital _ sampling _ of the energy flow in the forward region opposite to the tag ( approximately @xmath24 ) .",
    "one need only look at the lower @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) regions , where the low-@xmath6 cross  section is higher , to see the importance of at least sampling the final state at small angles , because this is where the largest differences are seen between low-@xmath6 ( @xmath17 ) and high-@xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) events .",
    "looking at the photon structure problem at low-@xmath6 another way , one is likely to see in the final state the signature of a low-@xmath6 rise , due to the process that would be responsible for it , before ever unfolding to extract @xmath5 - once again it is the knowledge of the hadronic response of the detector that is important .",
    "as the tagging angle increases the situation becomes easier because the final state is more well contained in the central detector ( the @xmath27 of the final state is higher in order to balance the higher @xmath27 of the tag ) .",
    "this is reflected by the energy flow distributions moving more towards the central detector ( cd ) as @xmath25 increases . in this tag region",
    "the measurement of @xmath5 is therefore less model dependent , so the study of the evolution of @xmath5 at high @xmath8 is still an achievable goal .",
    "a critical aspect of measuring @xmath5 is to ensure that the monte carlos used for the unfolding procedure correctly model the final state .",
    "energy flow distributions from tagged @xmath0 events have very similar shapes regardless of the beam energy in e@xmath3e@xmath4 collisions . using this fact , and the present knowledge of the lep @xmath5 analyses , it is forseen that the understanding of the hadronic response of the forward region of the lc detector is vital to the development of the final state models in @xmath0 monte carlos .",
    "this could be especially important in the determination of whether or not a low-@xmath6 rise exists in the photon structure function .",
