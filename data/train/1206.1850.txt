    "multivariate clustering patterns such as segregation and association result from multivariate interaction between two or more classes ( or species ) . for convenience , categories of the points or units",
    "are referred to as  classes \" , e.g. , a class can stand for species , sex , or some other characteristic of the unit / subject .",
    "segregation is the spatial pattern in which points from the same class are closer to each other , while association is the pattern in which points from different classes are closer to each other .",
    "these patterns may have important implications in ecology , plant biology , or epidemiology .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ecology , two tree species could be highly dependent on each other ( as a result of , say , symbiosis or mutualism ) , and thus , coexist in a close vicinity ( i.e. , they are associated ) , or they could be enjoying the company of conspecifics and thus form one - class clumps or groups ( i.e. , they are segregated ) . in epidemiology ,",
    "cases might be clustered compared to controls , due to infectious nature of a disease or closeness to a source of the disease ( i.e. , cases and controls are segregated ) . in a social context , segregation of residences due to the socioeconomic status or ethnicity can be investigated by generative models ( @xcite ) . in literature , spatial segregation",
    "is also used to refer to a univariate pattern of spatial clustering ( @xcite ) , which is referred to as aggregation ( @xcite ) . in a social network ,",
    "segregation of individuals are also modeled via random graph theoretical tools ( @xcite ) . in veterinary epidemiology , a nonparametric method for detecting spatial segregation according to the genotype and year of occurrence of bovine tuberculosis is employed by @xcite .",
    "many univariate ( i.e. , one - class ) or multivariate ( multi - class ) spatial clustering tests are proposed in literature ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "these methods include ripley s @xmath1-function ( @xcite ) , or @xmath2-function ( @xcite ) , nearest neighbor ( nn ) methods ( @xcite ) and so on .",
    "among nn methods , this article concerns the nearest neighbor contingency tables ( nncts ) .",
    "@xcite introduced various tests based on nncts , however , @xcite extended these tests in various directions , and also determined the correct asymptotic distribution of the proposed tests .",
    "@xcite compared nnct - tests in literature , and also proposed various tests based on nncts .    in this article , we introduce various new cell - specific segregation tests and overall tests based on the cell - specific tests .",
    "we compare these tests with the existing nnct - tests in literature ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate that cell - specific tests are asymptotically normal , and overall tests tend to chi - square distribution with the corresponding degrees of freedom . in practice ,",
    "cell - specific tests serve as post - hoc tests to be performed when an overall test yields a significant result . as an alternative post - hoc test after a significant overall test , we discuss one - class - versus - rest ( or one - vs - rest ) type of nnct - tests . by extensive monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we compare the newly proposed tests to the ones in literature in terms of empirical size and power , and determine which tests perform better for the segregation or association alternative and which ones are more robust to differences in relative abundances ( of the classes ) .",
    "we describe the nncts and provide the null and alternative patterns in section [ sec : null - alt - nncts ] , provide the cell - specific tests in section [ sec : cell - spec ] , overall tests in section [ sec : overall ] , empirical size analysis in the two- and three - class cases in sections [ sec : monte - carlo-2cl ] and [ sec : monte - carlo-3cl ] , respectively , and empirical power analysis under segregation and association in the two- and three - class cases in sections [ sec : emp - power-2cl ] and [ sec : emp - power-3cl ] , respectively .",
    "we present the empirical size and power analysis for the one - vs - rest type testing in the three - class case in section [ sec : one - vs - rest - size - power ] , the illustration on the example data set in section [ sec : example ] , and our conclusions and guidelines for using the tests in section [ sec : disc - conc ] .",
    "we describe the spatial point patterns for two classes only ; the extension to multi - class case is straightforward .",
    "our null hypothesis is @xmath3 which may result from _ random labeling _ ( rl ) or",
    "_ independence _ of points from two classes . under independence",
    ", the two classes result independently from the same stochastic process , so that their spatial distribution is identical . in this article , among independence patterns we will only consider complete spatial randomness ( csr ) of points from two classes . roughly , under _ csr independence _",
    ", two classes are independently uniformly distributed in a region of interest , while rl is the pattern in which , given a fixed set of points in a region , class labels are assigned to these fixed points randomly so that the labels are independent of the locations .    as alternatives ,",
    "we consider two major types of deviations from @xmath4 : segregation and association .",
    "_ segregation _ occurs if the nn of an individual is more likely to be of the same class as the individual than to be from a different class .",
    "that is , the probability that this individual having a nn from the same class is larger than the relative frequency of the same class ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "_ association _ occurs if the nn of an individual is more likely to be from another class than to be of the same class as the individual .",
    "that is , the probability that this individual having a nn from another class is larger than the relative frequency of the other class in question .",
    "these patterns are not symmetric , e.g. , for two classes , one class might be more associated with another class .",
    "for example , plant species @xmath5 could be more dependent on species @xmath6 , hence @xmath5 plants occur in close vicinity of @xmath6 plants , while the reverse relation may not be in the same level or type .",
    "also , class @xmath5 points might exhibit a stronger clustering , compared to class @xmath6 points , and so might be more segregated compared to class @xmath6 points .",
    "see @xcite for more detail on the null and alternative patterns .",
    "nncts are constructed using the nn frequencies of classes .",
    "the construction of nncts for two classes is described , e.g. , in @xcite , here we provide a brief description for @xmath7 classes .",
    "suppose there are @xmath8 classes labeled as @xmath9 .",
    "nncts are constructed using nn frequencies for each class .",
    "let @xmath10 be the number of points from class @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . if we record the class of each point and its nearest neighbor , the nn relationships fall into @xmath14 categories : @xmath15 where in category @xmath16 , class @xmath11 is the base class , while class @xmath17 is the class of the nn .",
    "denoting @xmath18 as the observed frequency of category @xmath16 for @xmath19 , we obtain the nnct in table [ tab : nnct - mxm ] where @xmath20 is the sum of column @xmath17 ; i.e. , number of times class @xmath17 points serve as nns for @xmath21 .",
    "note also that @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in cell",
    "@xmath16 , class @xmath11 is called the _ base class _ , and class @xmath17 is called the _ nn class_. here we adopt the convention that variables denoted by upper case letters are random quantities , while variables denoted by lower case letters are fixed quantities .",
    "thus , in our nnct - analysis , row sums are assumed to be fixed ( i.e. , class sizes are given ) , while column sums are assumed to be random and depend on the nn relationships between the classes .",

    "black gums and carolina ashes are segregated for about 2 - 2.5 , 3.5 - 4.5 , 7.5 - 8.5 , and 10.5 - 12 m ; black gums and bald cypresses are segregated for about 2.5 , 3 , and 6 m ; and carolina ashes and bald cypresses are associated for 7 and 9 m.    the pair correlation function estimates have considerably high variability for small @xmath64 if @xmath65 , hence not so reliable for small distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "see for example figures [ fig : swamp - pcfii ] and [ fig : swamp - pcfij ] where the confidence bands for small @xmath64 values are much wider compared to those for larger @xmath64 values .",
    "so pair correlation function analysis is more reliable for larger distances , say , larger than about the average nn distance in the data set .",
    "while the pair correlation function provides information on the univariate and bivariate patterns at all distances , nnct - tests summarize the spatial interaction for distances about the average nn distance in the data set .",
    "we introduce new cell - specific and overall segregation tests based on nearest neighbor contingency tables ( nncts ) .",
    "nnct - tests are used in testing randomness in the nearest neighbor ( nn ) structure between two or more classes with nn probabilities being proportional to the class frequencies .",
    "the overall test is used for testing any deviation from the null pattern in all the nnct cells combined ; cell - specific test for cell @xmath16 is used for testing any deviation from the null case in cell @xmath16 , i.e. , the probability of a ( base , nn ) in which base class is @xmath11 and nn class is @xmath17 is proportional to the product of frequencies of classes @xmath11 and @xmath17 .",

    "the null pattern is implied by the rl or csr independence patterns .",
    "we demonstrate that under the csr independence pattern , nnct - tests are conditional on @xmath68 and @xmath69 , while under the rl pattern , these tests are unconditional .",
    "although we consider five types of cell - specific and overall tests , we demonstrate that actually , these tests yield three distinct types of cell - specific or overall tests . more specifically , dixon s tests and type ii tests are identical , and so are type iii and type iv tests . hence in our empirical size and power",
    "analysis ( as well as in the example data ) , we only use and present dixon s , type i and iii test statistics . in the two - class case ,",
    "cell - specific tests are essentially different only for at most two cells , since cell @xmath70 and @xmath71 yield the same test statistic in absolute value for dixon s cell - specific test , likewise for cells @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "i cell - specific test cells @xmath70 and @xmath73 yield the same test statistic , and the off - diagonal cells give the negative of this value .    we demonstrate that the cell - specific tests tend to standard normal distribution , as the sample size gets larger .",
    "on the other hand , the overall tests tend to chi - square distribution with the corresponding degrees of freedom with the increasing sample size . in terms of the asymptotic distribution of the overall tests",
    ", we have two groups of tests . for @xmath8 classes ,",
    "dixon s overall test has @xmath74 distribution with @xmath75 df , while type i and iii tests have @xmath74 distribution with @xmath76 df .",
    "two major types of asymptotic structures for spatial data exist in literature : infill asymptotics and increasing domain asymptotics ( @xcite ) . in  infill asymptotics \" the region of interest is a fixed bounded region and the number of observed points gets larger in this region .",
    "hence the minimum distance between data points tends to zero as the sample size tends to infinity . in  increasing domain asymptotics \"",

    "we recommend the monte carlo randomization of the tests . in the two - class case ,",
