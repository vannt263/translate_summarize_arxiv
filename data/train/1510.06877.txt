    "the @xmath0 spacecraft is a magnificent instrument to search for long term frequency and amplitude modulations of oscillation modes in pulsating stars . among the 6 pulsating white dwarfs present in the @xmath0 field , kic  08626021",
    "is the unique db pulsator .",
    "it has a rotation period p@xmath1 days , estimated from the observed frequency spacings of 3 @xmath2-mode triplets @xcite .",
    "it has been observed by @xmath0 for 23 months in short cadence ( sc ) mode without interruption .",
    "thus , it is a suitable candidate to investigate the resonant mode coupling mechanisms that could induce long term amplitude and frequency modulations of the oscillation modes .",
    "such resonant couplings are predicted to occur in triplets where the rotationally shifted components have frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the frequency of the central component .",
    "the theoretical exploration of those mechanisms was extensively developed long before the era of space observations @xcite but was almost interrupted more than a decade ago because of the lack of clear observational evidence of such phenomena , due to the difficulty of capturing amplitude or frequency variations that occur on months to years timescales from ground based observatories .",
    "resonant coupling within triplets was proposed for the first time as the explanation for the frequency and amplitude long term variations observed in the gw vir pulsator pg 0122 + 200 @xcite .",
    "we present the analysis of kic  08626021 in which two triplets exhibit amplitude and frequency variations during the 23-month of observation .",
    "such time modulations pave the way to new asteroseismic diagnostics , providing in particular ways to measure for the first time linear growth rates of pulsation modes in white dwarf stars .",
    "the white dwarf star kic  08626021 has been continuously observed by @xmath0 since quarter q10.1 up to q17.2 .",
    "the high precision photometric data cover @xmath7684.2 days ( 23 months ) , with a duty circle of @xmath789 % .",
    "we used a dedicated software , felix , to extract frequencies ( details of the program can be found in @xcite ) . in this study , we concentrate on rotationally split triplets and investigate the variation of amplitude and frequency between components of these triplets and their relationship .",
    "we point out that the frequencies near 3682@xmath8hz reported by @xcite were in fact resolved into several close peaks with the 23-month light curve .",
    "it is therefore probably not a real triplet contrary to the other structures found at 4310 and 5073@xmath8hz ( see below ) . in order to study the variability with time of these modes",
    ", we constructed a filter window covering 200 days and slid the filter window along the whole light curve by time steps of 20 days , thus constructing a time - frequency diagram .",
    "we also prewhithened the frequencies `` chunk by chunk '' , i.e. , the 23-month light curve of kic  08626021 was divided into 20 chunks , each containing 6-month of data except the last 3 chunks being at the end of the observations .",
    "the results for the two triplets are discussed below .",
    "the amplitude and frequency modulations of the triplet near 4310 @xmath8hz are shown in figure[pf_mod ] . the grey scale ( or color scale for electronic version ) in the upper left panel represents the amplitude .",
    "the vertical dashed line in the lower left panel is the average value of the frequency over the entire run .",
    "the right panel shows the amplitude modulations of each component forming the triplet .",
    "both the amplitudes and frequencies show clear signatures of quasi periodic modulations with the same timescale of @xmath7750 days .",
    "the frequencies and amplitudes of the side components evolve in phase and are antiphased with the central component .",
    "figure[sf_mod ] shows the modulations observed in the other triplet at 5073@xmath8hz .",
    "the frequencies in this triplet appear to be stable during the nearly two years of monitoring , while the amplitudes show modulations .",
    "note that the amplitude of the @xmath9 = -1 component went down below the 4@xmath10 detection threshold and was essentially lost in the noise during the last half of the observations .",
    "the frequency and amplitude modulations observed in the triplets of kic 086226021 can be related to nonlinear resonant mode coupling mechanisms .",
    "the first triplet at 4310@xmath8hz ( figure[pf_mod ] ) behaves like if it is in the intermediate regime of the resonance , in which the oscillation modes undergo periodic amplitude and frequency modulations .",
    "theory suggests that the time scale of these modulations should be roughly a few times the inverse of the growth rate of the pulsating mode @xcite .",
    "therefore this periodicity could in principle be used to measure the growth rate .",
    "in addition if we compare the second order effect of rotational splitting as estimated directly from the measured mean frequencies : @xmath11 with the estimated value following @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the first order ledoux constant ( @xmath14 for dipole @xmath2-modes ) and @xmath15 is the angular frequency of the stellar rotation , i.e . ,",
    "@xmath16@xmath70.018@xmath8hz , both are found to be very similar . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the expected periodic modulation timescale is @xmath17 @xcite , which with the values given above leads to @xmath18 days , i.e. , very similar to the amplitude and frequency modulation timescale of 750 days roughly estimated from figure[pf_mod ] .",
    "this further supports our interpretation that nonlinear resonant coupling is indeed at work in this star .",
    "the triplet at 5073@xmath8hz ( figure[sf_mod ] ) would be in a different regime , likely in the nonresonant regime .",
    "the amplitude of the components show clear modulations while the frequency are relatively stable during the observation .",
    "this means the ratio of the real part over the imaginary part of the coupling coefficients is large in that case .",
    "this ratio roughly measures nonlinear nonadiabaticities in the star .",
    "hence our result shows that two neighbor triplets can belong to different resonant regimes ( frequency lock , time dependent or nonresonant ) , as it was also suggested in the white dwarf star gd 358 @xcite .",
    "frequency and amplitude modulations of oscillation modes have been found in several rotationally split multiplets detected in the db pulsator kic 08626021 , thanks to the high quality and long duration photometric data obtained with the @xmath0 spacecraft .",
    "these modulations show signatures pointing toward nonlinear resonant coupling mechanisms occuring among the multiplet components .",
    "this is the first time that such signatures are identified so clearly in white dwarf pulsating stars .",
    "periodic modulations of frequency and amplitude that occur in the intermediate resonant regime may allow for new asteroseismic diagnostics , providing in particular a way to measure for the first time linear growth rates of pulsation modes in white dwarf stars .",
    "such results should motivate further theoretical work on nonlinear resonant mode coupling mechanisms and revive interest in nonlinear stellar pulsation theory in general . finally , we mention that similar modulations are also found in hot b subdwarf stars according to @xmath0 data .",
