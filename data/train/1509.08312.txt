    "temporally correlated residuals are very common in the pulse time of arrival ( toa ) of pulsars , after accounting for the standard model of spin down , astrometric variations , interstellar medium ( ism ) effects and potential binary motion .",
    "the systematic deviations from the rotation model are referred as red timing - noise , since the toa residuals have more power in the low fourier frequencies than in the high frequencies . in order to find the signals of gravitational waves ( gw ) hidden in timing data @xcite , we need to model other sources of red noise as best as possible .",
    "most mechanisms which are proposed to explain the red timing - noise can be sorted into two classes : a ) random transfer of angular momentum , either between the neutron star curst and the interior @xcite , or between the neutron star and the fallback matter @xcite ; b ) variance of the braking torque @xcite .",
    "a new attempt was made by @xcite , who attributed the red noise in the timing residuals of psr b1937 + 21 to an unknown belt of asteroids .",
    "a swarm of orbiting objects around the pulsar is equivalent in mathematics to introducing many sinusoid waves components into the timing residuals .",
    "in fact , the timing residuals of psr b1937 + 21 in the time span of the study of @xcite can be more naturally fitted to a single cubic polynomial rather than to a series of sinusoids @xcite .    in the sample of @xcite ,",
    "a considerable number of pulsars timing residuals show the shape of a cubic polynomial , and some of the other pulsars exhibit the forth - order polynomial residuals or quasi - periodic structures , after fitting the pulse arrival phases to the spin frequency derivative ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "if the braking of pulsars is mainly contributed by the dipole radiation of a constant magnetic field , which is a simplest assumption and is widely used , the timing model needs only to include up to the @xmath4 term .",
    "however , the unexpectedly significant cubic and higher order terms in the timing residuals compel us to revisit such assumption .",
    "assume that the braking of a pulsar can be expressed as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the momentum of inertia and the radius of the pulsar , and @xmath8 is the equivalent magnetic field .",
    "we do not presume the @xmath8 to be constant , and as long as the relative change of the equivalent magnetic field @xmath9 is small , the following expression is valid : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dimensionless time variant part of @xmath8 .",
    "integration of equation ( [ first ] ) twice gives the pulse arrival phase : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is @xmath14 at the beginning of the observation ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is a constant phase offset and @xmath17 .    from equation ( [ five ] )",
    "one can clearly see that the linear term in @xmath11 will give rise to an extra cubic term in the timing residuals , and the @xmath18-th order polynomial term in @xmath11 will produce the @xmath19-th order polynomial term in the timing residuals . in other words :",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the timing residuals defined as : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    as for the evolution of @xmath8 ,",
    "one proposed mechanism is the decay of @xmath24 through ohmic dissipation @xcite .",
    "the monotonically decreasing of @xmath8 can only count for a positive @xmath1 , whereas in observations , the number of positive-@xmath1-pulsars does not overwhelm that of negative @xmath1 . in order to solve that problem",
    ", @xcite proposed that the long term decay of @xmath24 is modulated by short term oscillations . therefore , in a time span shorter than the oscillation period , the value of @xmath24 can be both increasing and decreasing , and",
    "the sign of @xmath1 can be both positive and negative .",
    "another possibility was proposed by @xcite that the magnetic inclination angle @xmath0 drifts , and they argued that the consequent change of the equivalent magnetic field can take account for the 45 years of timing residuals of the crab pulsar . in this work",
    "we further study this possibility . in section 2 and 3 ,",
    "we derive how the evolution of @xmath0 will affect the timing residuals , given that the braking torque is the combination of the dipole radiation and the current loss , and how this model can explain observations . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the origins of the @xmath0 evolution , and what we can learn from the observed braking index . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss how our theory is related to observations , and what can not be explained by this mechanism .",
    "we conclude our work in the final section .",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation braking mechanism predicts that @xmath0 of a pulsar approaches 0 or @xmath25 , and if the braking is dominated by the current loss , @xmath0 approaches @xmath26 @xcite . as was pointed out by many authors @xcite that the dipole braking is not efficient when the pulsar is surrounded by plasma , and the observed profile evolution of the crab pulsar implies that @xmath0 is drifting towards @xmath26 as expected by the current loss mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the total braking torque of a pulsar as a combination of both mechanisms @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is to take account the inefficiency of dipole radiation braking .",
    "@xmath29 is parallel with the spin axis , and its value is : @xmath30 @xmath31 is in the direction of the magnetic dipole ; the component parallel to the spin axis contributes to the braking of the pulsar : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scaling factor proportional to the ratio between the electric - current density in the pulsar tube and the goldreich - julian current ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 12 ) ) .    as a result of the combination ,",
    "the equivalent magnetic field of equation ( [ first ] ) is @xmath34 then equation ( [ ten ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath35 where @xmath36b^2_0 $ ] .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that during the observation time span , the change rate of @xmath0 can be treated as a constant @xmath37 , therefore @xmath38    equation ( [ ele ] ) becomes : @xmath39 suppose the change of @xmath0 is small , thus equation ( [ twelve ] ) can be expanded as : @xmath40 in equation ( [ 13 ] ) , @xmath41 is once again redefined to absorb the factor @xmath42 , and @xmath43 which is a time - independent constant . comparing with equation ( [ four ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath44 as a result , from equation ( [ five ] ) we expect to see the fourth - order polynomial as the pulse arrival phase : @xmath45 where @xmath46    if we use the concept of characteristic age , @xmath47 , then the first equation in equations ( [ 14 ] ) can be written as @xmath48    several conclusions * can be drawn * from equation ( [ a ] ) : a ) for young pulsars whose @xmath49 are small , the first term in the bracket of equation ( [ a ] ) dominates and therefore have @xmath50 ; b ) for old pulsars , the second term in the bracket of equation ( [ a ] ) dominate .",
    "since @xmath51 can be either positive and negative , @xmath52 can be either @xmath53 or @xmath54 ; c ) : the absolute values of @xmath52 are proportional to @xmath55 statistically , as long as the quantity @xmath56 distributes in a small range for all the pulsars .",
    "all of the three predictions have been confirmed by observations ( see * ? ? ? * figure1 ) .",
    "the braking index is defined as @xmath57 . from equation (",
    "[ 14 ] ) we know that : @xmath58 since @xmath18 is widely distributed over eight order of magnitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 10 ) ) , we can infer that @xmath59 for most of the pulsars .",
    "equation ( [ bi ] ) can also be rewritten in terms of the characteristic age : @xmath60 equation ( [ bi2 ] ) can be used to explain the observation fact that the absolute values of @xmath18 are proportional to @xmath49 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) .",
    "we use equation ( [ poa ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) to simulate the toas , and fit a second degree polynomial to the toas .",
    "the resulting timing residuals are plotted in figure [ figure1 ] , under different simulating parameters ( see the caption of the figure ) .",
    "the shapes of four panels of figure [ figure1 ] include most of that of the pulsars timing residuals in the sample of @xcite .",
    "the variety of the shapes of observed timing residuals is due to various values of @xmath61 and @xmath37 at different stages of the evolution .",

    "the evolution of @xmath0 can come from either the intrinsic change of the magnetic field originating from the interior of the neutron star , or a kinematic process due to the rotation of the pulsar . as mentioned above ,",
    "both the magnetic dipole braking and the current loss predict a kinematic @xmath0 evolution , and the combination of them gives @xcite : @xmath73 therefore , @xmath74 from equation ( [ aaaa ] ) we see that if @xmath75 then the magnetic dipole moves towards the equator of the pulsar , and when @xmath76 the magnetic dipole evolves towards alignment with the spin axis .    in equation ( [ bi2 ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath37 is determined by equation ( [ aaaa ] ) , then @xmath77    therefore , as long as @xmath33 is positive ( as widely supposed ) , @xmath78 and @xmath18 is aways larger than 3 .",
    "it is intuitive since the kinematic processes will simultaneously adjust the configuration of the pulsar so that the braking torque decreases . as a result",
    ", a pulsar with @xmath79 requires that the intrinsic magnetic field of the neutron star is evolving .",
    "if we do not assume @xmath80 , then @xmath79 requires that ( from equation ( [ xiongxiong ] ) ) @xmath81",
    "the magnetic inclination angle @xmath0 in this work is defined as the angle between the spin vector of the pulsar and the north pole of the magnetic dipole .",
    "this is different from the magnetic inclination angles @xmath82 which are measured by fitting the rotation vector model ( rvm ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath82 is defined as the angle between the spin vector and the end of magnetic dipole which is being observed .",
    "therefore @xmath0 can be either equal to @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "the same ambiguity also exists in @xmath3 : the observation can only tell whether the magnetic north pole is moving towards the spin axis or towards the equator , but can not tell whether @xmath0 is increasing or decreasing .    from equation ( [ 14 ] )",
    "we have : @xmath84 we denote @xmath85 which is calculated using the left - hand side of equation ( [ 19 ] ) as @xmath86 , and @xmath85 which is calculated by the definition in the right - hand side of equation ( [ 19 ] ) as @xmath87 .",
    "we use equation ( [ 19 ] ) and the parameters from the atnf catalogue @xcite to calculate the values of @xmath86 , which are listed in table [ table ] .",
    "other atnf pulsars which are not listed here have no significant @xmath88 . for a typical value of @xmath61=1rad , which is the expectation value assuming the isotropic distribution , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the estimated distribution of @xmath0 from observation depends heavily on the assumption on the shape of the radio beam . therefore according to the values of @xmath37 implied by table [ table ]",
    ", @xmath0 will approach to @xmath91 or @xmath26 in a time scale from years to thousands of years .",
    "these time scales are several orders of magnitudes less than the ages of pulsars , and based on the above section we expect that @xmath92 for most of the pulsars .",
    "this implies that during the life time of a pulsar , @xmath3 must change its sign for many times , which explains why there are approximately equal number of positive and negative @xmath85 in table [ table ] .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath0 necessarily causes oscillation of the equivalent @xmath24 of a pulsar , and thus might be responsible for the proposed oscillation of the magnetic field of neutron stars in @xcite .",
    ".**the values of @xmath86 of antf pulsars . * * [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      @xcite used the inferred drift of @xmath0 to explain the braking index of 2.5 of the crab pulsar ( psr j0534 + 2200 ) . from table [ table ] we see that @xmath93rad s@xmath67 for the crab pulsar .",
    "however the observation suggests that @xmath94 rad s@xmath67 towards the equator , and @xmath95 or @xmath96@xcite . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath97rad s@xmath67 .",
    "the inconsistency between @xmath86 and @xmath87 indicates that more evolution of the neutron star magnetic field is required for the rotation behavior of the crab pulsar . from section [ section4 ]",
    "we learnt that since the braking index of the crab pulsar is less than 3 , an intrinsic change of the magnetic field is needed .",
    "therefore the strength and @xmath0 of the magnetic field of the crab pulsar might evolve together .",
    "thus , the @xmath24 field strength evolution mechanisms @xcite can not be replaced by the pure @xmath0 evolution .",
    "the pulsar wind braking @xcite is another competitive explanation for the abnormal rotational behavior of the crab pulsar , which has been studied by @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 induces the extra cubic and fourth - order terms in the timing residuals , therefore a fitting to the fourth - order polynomial can remove the effects .",
    "however an arbitrary fitting of polynomial may also remove other useful signals in the timing residuals , e.g. , gw .",
    "although @xmath0 and @xmath37 can be constrained by observations , we can not yet constrain @xmath52 and @xmath98 since @xmath99 is unknown in equations ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , these two terms are coupled with each other by equation ( [ 19 ] ) . therefore if @xmath0 and @xmath3 ( and thus @xmath87 ) are determined by independent methods , we can reduce the number of free parameters as shown in @xmath100 and thus alleviate the removal of other useful signals while fitting a fourth - order polynomial to the timing residuals .",
    "we modeled the braking torque of the pulsar spin - down as a combination of the dipole radiation and the current loss , and derived the red timing - noise caused by the evolution of the magnetic inclination angle @xmath0 of pulsars . with this model , we reproduced the four typical types of timing residuals observed in the sample of @xcite . comparing with observations , we calculated the quantity @xmath101 for nine pulsars in the atnf catalogue .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "the cubic and the fourth - order polynomial terms in the timing residuals can be explained as a result of the evolution of magnetic inclination angle ( see equations ( [ 14 ] ) ) , if we consider the spin - down mechanism of pulsars to be a combination of the magnetic dipole radiation and the current loss .",
    "the variety of shapes of the timing residuals originate from the various values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 at different stages of the evolution ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "2 .   the evolution of magnetic inclination angle can explain the following observation facts : a ) young pulsars ( small @xmath49 ) have @xmath50 ; b ) old pulsars can have either @xmath102 or @xmath50 ; c ) @xmath103 are proportional to @xmath104 among pulsars ; d ) @xmath105 are proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "3 .   the evolution of @xmath0 purely due to rotation kinematics can not explain the pulsars with braking index less than 3 . the intrinsic change of the magnetic field ( either strength or @xmath0 ) is needed .",
    "4 .   the sign of @xmath3 changes many times during the lifetime of a pulsar , which might be responsible for the proposed oscillation of the magnetic field of neutron stars in @xcite . 5 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 is not sufficient to explain the rotation behavior of the crab pulsar .",
