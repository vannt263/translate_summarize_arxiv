    "current high precision data from ground - based @xcite and space - based @xcite cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) telescopes indicate that the origin of structure in the universe is due to a primordial spectrum of nearly adiabatic and nearly scale - invariant cosmological fluctuations . as realized long before these observations @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , a phase of cosmological inflation during the very early universe will generate such a spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "inflation is not the only way to generate such a spectrum .",
    "as realized in @xcite , a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations on super - hubble scales is also generated during a phase of matter - dominated contraction . in order to make contact with the present expanding universe ,",
    "new physics is required to allow for the transition between the contracting and expanding phases .",
    "such a transition can in principle either be singular and from the point of view of the low - energy effective theory ( as in the case of the original ekpyrotic scenario @xcite ) , or non - singular . there are various ways of obtaining a non - singular bounce , e.g. by modifying the gravitational action as in horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , torsion gravity @xcite , or by adding null energy condition violating matter such as a ghost condensate @xcite or galileon @xcite field . a cosmological model with an initial phase of matter - dominated contraction and a non - singular bounce",
    "is called the _",
    "matter bounce _",
    "scenario and it provides an alternative to cosmological inflation for generating the observed spectrum of cosmological fluctuations ( see e.g. @xcite for review articles on the matter bounce scenario ) .    a problem for most bouncing cosmologies is the instability against anisotropic stress , the bkl instability @xcite .",
    "an intuitive way of understanding this problem is to note that the effective energy density in anisotropies evolves with the cosmological scale factor @xmath0 as @xmath1 , and thus increases much faster in a contracting universe than the energy densities in matter and radiation .",
    "hence , unless the initial anisotropies are not tuned to zero to a very high precision , no homogeneous bounce will occur .",
    "the solution to this problem , first implemented in the context of the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , is to introduce a new matter field @xmath2 during the contracting phase whose energy density scales with a higher power of @xmath3 than that of the anisotropy term and which hence dominates the total energy density during the later phases of contraction .",
    "with such a field , the bkl instability can be avoided @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a concrete model was proposed in which the new field @xmath2 generates both the ekpyrotic contraction phase and the non - singular bounce .",
    "this is obtained by giving @xmath2 a galileon - type non - standard kinetic action ( which yields the non - singular bounce ) , and by providing it with a negative exponential potential which then yields the ekpyrotic contraction .",
    "if we assume that the contracting period starts with a phase of matter - domination , we obtain a realization of the `` matter bounce '' scenario . in @xcite",
    "the evolution of the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations across the bounce phase was studied in detail . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the two problems for a certain class of non - singular bounce models discussed in @xcite do not arise the stability of this model against anisotropic stress was then confirmed in @xcite by following the cosmological evolution in the context of an anisotropic bianchi ansatz .    in the model of @xcite ( and in many other implementations of the `` matter bounce '' )",
    "there are two matter fields , the field @xmath2 and a field @xmath4 representing the matter which initially dominates the phase of contraction , and which has an equation of state @xmath5 , @xmath6 denoting the pressure density",
    ". thus , in general there will not only be adiabatic cosmological fluctuations , but also entropic ones . in this paper",
    "we give a careful analysis of the evolution of both background and cosmological perturbations in the two field scenario in which a first field @xmath4 generates a matter phase of contraction , and a second field @xmath2 which has a negative exponential potential and hence yields a later phase of ekpyrotic contraction , and which has a non - trivial kinetic action which generates a non - singular bounce .",
    "we begin in the matter - dominated period of contraction with vacuum fluctuations of both scalar fields . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the resulting power spectrum is blue , since the field has a mass . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the resulting power spectrum on super - hubble scales is scale - invariant . in the far past",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath2 corresponds to the entropy mode , while @xmath4 corresponds to the adiabatic mode .",
    "however , at the transition between the matter phase and the ekpyrotic phase , @xmath2 becomes the adiabatic field , and thus a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations results .",
    "due to the gravitational mixing between the two modes during the matter phase of contraction , the @xmath2 fluctuations induce a scale - invariant component to the spectrum of @xmath4 fluctuations at the end of the matter phase of contraction ( this is the analog of the `` curvaton '' scenario of structure formation @xcite - see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the mode which becomes the entropy mode during the later phases of evolution also inherits a scale - invariant contribution in addition to the original contribution which has a steep blue spectrum .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we discuss the model for a non - singular bounce proposed in @xcite , and how this is affected by the addition of an additional scalar field of k - essence form . in section",
    "iii we describe the background cosmological evolution by splitting the time history of the universe into phases : matter contraction , ekpyrotic contraction , non - singular bounce , and fast roll expansion . to justify this phase structure , and to serve as a evidence that this model is feasible , we study the background numerically . in section iv",
    ", we consider the evolution of perturbations our model , which we then use in section v to calculate the power spectra at late times .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks in section vi .    a word on notation : we define the reduced planck mass by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the sign of the metric is taken to be @xmath9 .",
    "note that we take the value of the scale factor at the bounce point to be @xmath10 throughout the paper .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the model of interest for the present work is that of two scalar fields : a matter field which dominates at very early times , and a bounce field which violates the null energy condition for a brief period , inducing the bounce .",
    "we begin with the most general lagrangian for this class of models , given by @xmath11 where @xmath2 is the bounce field of galilean type , @xmath4 is a k - essence scalar of general form , and have defined @xmath12 as well as the dalembertian operator @xmath13 the lagrangian terms for the bounce field are defined as @xmath14x + \\beta { x}^2 - v(\\phi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath15 where we have parametrized the model via the positive - definite constants ensures that the kinetic term is bounded from below at high energy scales ] @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as well as the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the term @xmath20 is a galileon - type operator which we have introduced to stabilize the gradient term of cosmological perturbations , and leads to a sound speed which is positive - definite at all time except for during the bounce .",
    "note that we have adopted the convention that @xmath2 is dimensionless , and",
    "so we include a factor of @xmath21 in @xmath22 .",
    "the bounce is triggered when @xmath23 , which causes @xmath2 to form a ghost condensate and hence violate the null energy condition .",
    "the function is negligible far from the bounce , such that the bounce field @xmath2 will have canonical kinetic terms at early and late times , given suitable behaviour for @xmath24 .",
    "we can build this function by setting the bounce to occur at @xmath25 , and requiring that @xmath26 when @xmath27 but @xmath28 when @xmath29 .",
    "we choose its form to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath6 are positive constants , with @xmath32 larger than unity , @xmath33 and @xmath6 smaller than unity , @xmath34 .",
    "the bounce field potential @xmath19 is chosen to ensure that the bounce is preceded by a phase of ekpyrotic contraction , which is necessary to dilute anisotropy and avoid the bkl instability .",
    "the potential can also be chosen to give an attractor solution in both the expanding and contracting branches of the cosmological evolution , by making use of exponential functions .",
    "we take the form of the potential to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a positive constant with dimension of @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a positive constant that must be smaller than @xmath39 in order to obtain ekpyrotic contraction , and the constant @xmath40 is an asymmetry parameter for the potential . the attractor solution is induced during expansion by the positive - valued exponential , while the negative exponential leads to an attractor solution in the contracting phase .",
    "we now turn to the second field @xmath4 , which we introduce to play the role of an arbitrary matter field satisfying the null energy condition .",
    "initially , we take its lagrangian to be of k - essence form , @xmath41 , but eventually we will consider a canonical massive free scalar field .",
    "it has pressure and energy density given by @xmath42 there are two important quantities for this system : the equation of state @xmath43 and the sound speed square @xmath44 .",
    "these are given by @xmath45    we now consider the spatially flat frw universe whose metric is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is cosmic time , @xmath48 are the comoving spatial coordinates and @xmath0 is the scale factor .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor can be characterized by the hubble rate : @xmath49 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath47 .    at the background level",
    "the universe is homogenous , and thus both the bounce field @xmath2 and the matter field @xmath4 are only functions of cosmic time .",
    "thus , the kinetic terms of these two fields become @xmath50 the pressure and energy density of the bounce field are given by @xmath51 where dynamics of @xmath2 are governed by the equation of motion @xmath52 and we have introduced @xmath53 from eq .  , it is clear that the function @xmath54 determines the positivity of the kinetic term of the scalar field and thus can be used to determine whether the model contains a ghost or not at the perturbative level ; the function @xmath55 on the other hand , represents an effective damping term . by keeping the first terms of the expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 and setting @xmath56 , which is a good approximation far from the bounce where @xmath57",
    ", one can recover the standard klein - gordon equation in the frw background .",
    "note that the friction term @xmath55 contains the contributions from the matter fluid , which can be suppressed for small values of @xmath58 .",
    "however , these terms will become important during the bounce phase where @xmath58 reaches a maximal value .    for completeness",
    ", we can write down the einstein equations in this background , @xmath59 and the corresponding friedmann equations , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the total energy density and pressure in the frw universe , e.g. the sum of the contributions of the bounce field and the matter field .",
    "the initial conditions of the background are chosen such that the universe is initially dominated by regular matter in the contracting phase , which in our model is mimicked by the matter field @xmath4 . since the potential of the bounce field @xmath19 has an ekpyrotic potential for @xmath63 , the corresponding energy density grows faster than that of regular matter . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath2 eventually becomes dominant , signaling the end of matter contraction .",
    "after that , the ekpyrotic phase of contraction begins , and lasts until the non - singular bounce interval begins ( this is the phase where the effects coming from new physics dominate ) , followed by a period of fast - roll expansion , which in turn ends at a transition to the expansion of standard big bang cosmology .",
    "we choose the initial conditions for the density of regular matter and for the value of @xmath2 such that the temperature at which the ekpyrotic phase begins is higher than that at the time of equal matter and radiation in the standard big bang expanding phase .      in the following we briefly investigate the evolution of the universe in each of the periods mentioned above , and refer to @xcite for a more generic analysis in which the anisotropy was taken into account as well .",
    "we start by considering the period when the universe is dominated by the matter field @xmath4 .",
    "we take the lagrangian of @xmath4 to be that of a free canonically normalized massive scalar field : @xmath64 thus the matter field oscillates around its vacuum state @xmath65 and the time - averaged background equation of state parameter is roughly @xmath66 . in this phase",
    ", the scale factor evolves as @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the final moment of matter contraction and the beginning of the ekpyrotic phase , and @xmath69 is the value of the scale factor at the time @xmath68 . in the above , @xmath70 is an integration constant which is introduced to match the hubble parameter continuously at the time @xmath68 , @xmath71 hence the hubble parameter can be approximated by @xmath72 where the angular brackets stand for averaging over time .",
    "the solution for the scalar field @xmath4 can be asymptotically expressed ( modulo a phase ) as @xmath73 with a time dependent amplitude @xmath74 which yields an equation of state with has vanishing pressure when averaged over an oscillation period of the field .",
    "we assume a homogeneous scalar field @xmath2 which is initially placed in the region @xmath75 in the phase of matter contraction . in this case , the lagrangian for @xmath2 approaches the conventional canonical form .",
    "once @xmath2 begins to dominate the energy - momentum tensor of matter , it then approaches an attractor solution which is given by @xmath76 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is an integration constant which chosen such that the hubble parameter at the end of the phase of ekpyrotic contraction matches with the one at the beginning of the bounce phase .",
    "this attractor solution corresponds to an effective equation of state @xmath78    during the phase of ekpyrotic contraction , the scale factor evolves as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the value of scale factor at the time @xmath81 which corresponds to the end of ekpyrotic contraction and the beginning of the bounce phase .",
    "therefore , the hubble parameter is given by @xmath82 where , in order to make @xmath83 continuous at the time @xmath81 , one must set @xmath84 additionally , we require the scale factor to evolve smoothly and continuously at the time @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to the relation @xmath85      in our model the scalar field evolves monotonically from @xmath75 to @xmath86 . for values of @xmath2 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( assuming one term in the denominator of @xmath18 dominates over the other at each transition time ) ,",
    "the value of the function @xmath18 becomes larger than unity and thus the universe enters a ghost condensate state .",
    "the occurrence of the ghost condensate naturally yields a short period of null energy condition violation and this in turn gives rise to a non - singular bounce @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have two useful parameterizations to describe the evolution of the scale factor in the bounce phase .",
    "one is the linear parametrization of the hubble parameter @xmath89 and the other is the evolution of the background scalar @xmath90 where the coefficient @xmath91 is set by the detailed microphysics of the bounce .",
    "the coefficient @xmath92 can be determined by matching the detailed evolution of the scalar field at the beginning or the end of the bounce phase , which will be addressed in next subsection .",
    "thus , during the bounce the scale factor evolves as @xmath93    note that a non - singular bounce requires that the total energy density vanishes at the bounce point .",
    "the total energy density includes the contributions from the matter fields and the anisotropy factors .",
    "this leads to the following result for the value of @xmath94 @xmath95 \\nonumber\\\\   & \\simeq & \\frac{2(g_0 - 1)}{3\\beta } m_p^2 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made use of approximations that @xmath96 and @xmath97 are much less than @xmath36 and @xmath98 in the second line .",
    "these approximations must be valid for the model to hold since both @xmath96 and @xmath97 are greatly diluted in the ekpyrotic phase and @xmath36 is the maximal absolute value of the potential of @xmath2 which , according to the observational constraint from the amplitude of cosmological perturbations , must be far below the planck scale .      after the bounce , the universe enters the expanding phase , where the universe is still dominated by the scalar field @xmath2 . during this stage ,",
    "the motion of @xmath2 is dominated by its kinetic term while the potential is negligible .",
    "thus , the background equation of state parameter is @xmath99 .",
    "this corresponds to a period of fast - roll expansion , where the scale factor evolves as @xmath100 where @xmath101 represents the end of the bounce phase and the beginning of the fast - roll period , and @xmath102 is the value of the scale factor at that moment .",
    "then one can write down the hubble parameter in the fast - roll phase @xmath103 and the continuity of the hubble parameter at @xmath101 yields @xmath104    recall that , in eq . , we made use of a gaussian parametrization of the scalar field evolution in the bounce phase , with characteristic timescale @xmath92 . in the fast roll phase",
    "we find the following approximate solution for the evolution of @xmath2 : @xmath105 where we have applied in the second equality .",
    "this implies that @xmath106 moreover , the friedmann equation requires that @xmath107 in the fast - roll phase , so that @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      to justify our claims that the background does exhibit this phase structure , we numerically solve the background equations of motion .",
    "we present this solely as a ` proof of principle ' , in order to illustrate the occurrence of a non - singular bounce in the model under consideration . by this",
    "we mean that the parameters are chosen to make the effect of the matter field @xmath4 manifest during the bounce , but this parameter choice does not necessarily satisfy the bounds imposed by observations .",
    "assuming parameter values taking into account the experimental constraints would lead to an ekpyrotic phase which is long enough to dilute all the matter fields , which would decrease the significance of entropy perturbations .",
    "similarly , in the limit that the ekpyrotic phase stretches to the infinite past , the evolution of the background approaches that obtained in a regular isotropic bounce model realized by a single field as studied in @xcite .    in the numerical calculation we work in units of the planck mass @xmath110 for all variables .",
    "we specifically set a group of model parameters as , @xmath111 moreover we choose the initial conditions for the bounce field and matter field as follows , @xmath112    our numerical results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : heos ] and [ fig : rhoomega ] . in order to enlarge the details of the cosmic evolution",

    "the main plot shows that a non - singular bounce occurs , and that the time scale of the bounce is short ( it is a `` fast bounce '' model ) .",

    "[ fig : heos ] . ]    from the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heos ] , one can see that the hubble parameter evolves smoothly through the bounce point with an approximately linear dependence on cosmic time . however , the bounce phase is not symmetric with respect to the bounce point in this model .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heos ] shows that the background equation of state initially takes an average value @xmath66 since the universe is dominated by the oscillating matter field @xmath4 . during the matter contraction ,",
    "the bounce field slowly becomes dominant over and triggers a period of ekpyrotic contraction , where for our parametrization the equation of state is approximately equal to @xmath119 .",
    "when the universe enters the bounce phase , the background equation of state experiences a sudden decrease to negative infinity and then evolves back to a value @xmath120 which signals a fast - roll expanding phase .    in order to better characterize the transitions between different phases , we plot the evolution of the energy densities and density parameters in fig .",

    "the density parameters are defined as @xmath121 where the subscript  @xmath122 \" represents @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this figure explicitly shows that the universe in this model experiences four phases : matter contraction , ekpyrotic contraction , the bounce , and fast - roll expansion .",
    "in this section we study the dynamics of linear cosmological perturbations in the two field matter bounce .",
    "one attractive property of a non - singular bounce cosmology is that perturbation modes can be evolved smoothly through the bounce phase . in linear theory ,",
    "perturbations of scalar type evolve independently from those of vector and tensor type .",
    "this reduces the number of degrees of freedom which must be analyzed .",
    "in addition , as a consequence of linearity one can track each fourier mode independently ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey of the theory of cosmological perturbations and @xcite for an introductory overview ) .",
    "the evolution of the fourier modes depends on the background cosmology .    as per the analysis presented in the previous section",
    ", our cosmological background will first undergo matter contraction , then a period of ekpyrotic contraction , followed by a non - singular bounce , and then a phase of fast roll expansion .",
    "we begin with vacuum fluctuations on sub - hubble scales in contracting phase . during the phase of contraction ,",
    "wavelengths exit the hubble radius ( which is shrinking in comoving coordinates ) .",
    "once they are on super - hubble scales , the modes are squeezed .",
    "both the exiting of the hubble radius and the squeezing on super - hubble scales is similar to what happens during the phase of accelerated expansion in inflationary cosmology .",
    "however , in the case of inflation the hubble length has constant physical size while the physical wavelength of fluctuations increases exponentially .",
    "hence , if the period of inflation was long , the physical wavelength of the fluctuations was initially smaller than the planck length , leading to the ` trans - planckian problem ' for fluctuations @xcite",
    ". this problem does not arise in a bouncing cosmology as long as the energy scale of the bounce is smaller than the planck scale , as is required for the self - consistency of any effective field treatment such as what we are presenting , since then the physical wavelength of the fluctuation modes which we measure today were always much larger than the planck length scale .    as was initially realized in @xcite ,",
    "a consequence of the super - hubble growth of fluctuations in a contracting universe is that the initial vacuum fluctuations of a massless scalar field ( and consequently also the curvature fluctuations in a model in which the only matter component is this massless field ) are converted to a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "it is in this sense that the matter bounce can provide an alternative to inflationary cosmology as a mechanism to form the cosmological fluctuations we observe today .",
    "however , the model under consideration involves two scalar fields , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , with @xmath4 leading to a phase of a matter contraction at early times , and @xmath2 being responsible for the ekpyrotic phase and the bounce . the dominant field in the initial matter phase of contraction is massive and hence its vacuum spectrum does not evolve into a scale - invariant form in isolation . the field @xmath2 , on the other hand , is effectively massless at early times and hence evolves to a scale - invariant spectrum on super - hubble scales .",
    "the field @xmath2 acts an entropy field during the phase of matter contraction .",
    "however , once the ekpyrotic phase begins , @xmath2 becomes dominant and becomes the curvature mode , while the @xmath4 fluctuations become the entropy modes .",
    "as is well known , entropy modes source a growing curvature perturbation on super - hubble scales thus , to determine the final spectrum of curvature and entropy fluctuations in our model we must carefully study the interaction of the two fluctuation modes in each cosmological phase .",
    "as we will show , in the matter phase of contraction , the scale - invariant @xmath2 mode ( which acts as an entropy fluctuation ) seeds a curvature fluctuation ( the @xmath4 mode in the initial phase ) of comparable magnitude .",
    "thus , at the end of the matter - dominated phase of contraction , both modes are scale - invariant and have comparable amplitude . after that time",
    ", it is no longer important to consider the sourcing of the adiabatic mode by the entropy mode since the adiabatic mode is already larger in amplitude ( and the effect of the sourcing can not induce a larger amplitude than that of the source )    in many non - singular bounce models it has been shown that the scale - invariance of curvature fluctuations is preserved during the bounce phase ( see , however , the exceptions discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that this is also the case in our model .",
    "we will also evolve the entropy fluctuations on super - hubble scales and will show that they preserve their scale - invariance on large scales .",
    "moreover the curvature mode are amplified compared to the the entropy mode during the bounce phase , and thus the final spectrum of fluctuations is almost completely adiabatic .    in both the matter contraction phase and the ekpyrotic phase , the lagrangian of the bounce scalar recovers the canonical form , since the higher derivative terms are suppressed by the small value of @xmath58 . in the matter contraction phase , it is convenient to study the evolution of perturbation modes in the spatially flat gauge ( @xmath123 ) and the initial conditions for two field fluctuations can be imposed inside the hubble radius .",

    "considering the group of canonical values for model parameters as given in the previous section discussing the background analysis , we find that this ratio can be as low as of order @xmath277 .",

    "thus , as long as the initial conditions are chosen such that the ekpyrotic period of contraction begins before the anisotropies dominate , the background will evolve towards a homogeneous and isotropic state .",

    "however , the entropy mode continuously seeds a contribution to the curvature fluctuation .",
    "this contribution is scale - invariant , and we have shown that its amplitude at the end of the matter phase of contraction is of the same order of magnitude as the initial entropy fluctuation .",
    "once the ekpyrotic phase of contraction begins , the roles of the adiabatic and entropy modes change : it is now the dominant field @xmath2 which determines the adiabatic mode , and @xmath4 becomes the entropy mode . since the fluctuations in @xmath2 have a scale - invariant spectrum , the curvature perturbations inherit a scale - invariant spectrum at the beginning of the ekpyrotic phase , whereas the fluctuations associated with @xmath4 which have developed a scale - invariant form ( due to the seeding mentioned above ) become the entropy mode .",

    "the curvature fluctuations are amplified during the bounce phase , but for a fast bounce the amplification of the entropy mode is negligible .",
    "hence , the entropic contribution to the late time fluctuations is suppressed .",
    "it is , in fact , suppressed by the same factor as the tensor perturbations to the scalar ones , since the tensor modes have the same squeezing factor as the entropy field .",
    "one serious shortcoming of the model under consideration is the lack of a prediction for the spectral tilt of perturbations in agreement with cmb observations , which require a red tilt . at best ,",
    "this model is capable of producing a scale invariant spectrum for the cmb , however scale invariance has been ruled out by planck at the @xmath278 level @xcite . given this ,",
    "we emphasize that the focus of our work is the study of perturbations through a non - singular bounce , and hence we are primarily concerned with the evolution inside of the ` black - box ' that separates the contracting and expanding branches of the cosmological evolution .",
    "the tilt is due to the choice of contracting branch , and in this study we have chosen matter contraction as our toy model , purely for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , there do exist mechanisms which could induce a red tilted spectrum in this model .",
    "the simplest possibility is to generate the red tilt via a tachyonic coupling to a curvaton field .",
