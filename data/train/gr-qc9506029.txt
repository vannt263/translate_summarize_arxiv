    "recent developement in nonperturbative quantum gravity has shown that the loop representation is quite a decent tool for dealing with generally covariant field theories .",
    "this representation allowed one to find a wide class of solutions of quantum general relativity constraints@xcite , @xcite;there has also been found an interesting interface with the knot theory @xcite . the main goal of this paper is to construct the loop representation for the system which includes fermionic and two gauge fields : gravitational and electromagnetic .",
    "the loop representation in quantum theory is based on using the so - called loop variables which are the well - known in yang - mills theories wilson loop functionals .",
    "the dynamical variables of yang - mills theory ( as well as of general relativity in the framework of ashtekar variables ) are connection field over the spatial manifold and its conjugate momentum .",
    "wilson loop functionals form a set of gauge invariant non - local quantities built from the connection field and the `` loop '' approach is to regard these quantities as basic variables .",
    "this becomes a very powerful means when one considers a generally covariant field theory . in this case",
    "the lack of background structure does not allow one to construct a renormalized operator corresponding to a local classical variable  in other words a renormalization procedure for constructing such an operator turns out to be background dependent .",
    "on the other hand , loop variables are non - local quantities ; one does not need any background structure to construct a representation of these variables in terms of operators in a hilbert space .",
    "so , when there is no background structure available for a quantization procedure , the following strategy has been proposed@xcite : it is to regard loop quantities as basic variables at the classical level and construct quantum theory representing the corresponding poisson algebra of loop variables by a certain operator algebra .",
    "there is also another problem which loop representation seems to be suited for  it is the problem of presence of constraints .",
    "constraints generate symmetry transformations and because of presence of symmetries not all degrees of freedom of the lagrange formulation are physical . the general strategy for quantizing such",
    "a system is to choose the coordinates on its phase space which have the simplest properties under the symmetry transformations and regard them as basic variables .",
    "the loop variables are just these quantities .",
    "the symmetry transformations of general relativity in the framework of ashtekar variables are gauge transformations and spatial diffeomorphisms . as we will see , for the system including also fermionic and electromagnetic fields the symmetry group consists of two similar parts : gauge and diffeomorphism transformations .",
    "it is the advantage of using loop variables that they are gauge invariant and transform very naturally under the diffeomorphism group , namely as the geometrical objects with which they are associated .",
    "that is why their usage simplifies considerably the problem of finding solutions to the gauge and diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "because loop variables contain _ all _ gauge invariant information , _ any _ local gauge invariant quantity can be expressed as a limit of corresponding loop variable .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian constraint of the theory can be written in terms of loop variables with a properly chosen limit procedure .",
    "this provides us with the hamiltonian operator regularization method , because the operator corresponding to a classical `` loop '' expression becomes a well defined operator in the loop space .",
    "it has been shown by rovelli and smolin @xcite that there exists such a way to take a limit that no divergences will appear and there arise a well defined operator in the loop space .",
    "so the loop representation which is based on the usage of loop variables can reduce the problem of solving the hamiltonian constraint to a simple combinatorical problem in the loop space .",
    "as it has been stated above , we develop quantization program for the system which includes not just pure gravitational field , but also fermionic and electromagnetic fields .",
    "it was noted by ashtekar _",
    "et al _ @xcite that there exists a natural possibility of unification gravity with other gauge fields in the hamiltonian framework ; it is to enlarge the gauge group of pure gravity @xmath1 to a group which describes a unified gauge field .",
    "the first work along this line @xcite concerned the loop representation for such a unified theory and its connection to the knot theory .",
    "we continue the developement of loop representation for the unified theory .",
    "it turnes out that enlargening of the gauge degrees of freedom , and therefore enlargening of the symmetry group , leads to some appealing features of the quantum theory in the loop representation .",
    "one of them is that the loop operators act even simpler than in the case of pure gravity : in the latter case momentum operators act with a result which includes both a loop and its inverse ; this is connected to the fact that loop variables corresponding to a loop and to its inverse coincide . in the case of the unified field these two quantities become independent : the loop variables acquire _",
    "orientation_. the difference from the case of pure gravity is that the loop operators never change this orientation when they act in the `` loop '' space .",
    "the poisson algebra of loop variables is described solely in terms of breaking , rearranging and rejoining loops and turns out to be simpler than in the case of pure general relativity .",
    "the example of the loop technique for fermions coupled to gravitational field was given by morales - tcolt and rovelli @xcite .",
    "unlike these authors , we consider the full - featured case when two independent fermionic fields are present .",
    "fermionic fields are described by two complex grasmann - valued spinor fields so the `` loop '' variables , which are mixed `` gauge  fermionic '' quantities , are even grassmann algebra elements .",
    "we construct the loop representation in which the action of quantum analogs of these variables can again be described in a geometric way : we will see that fermionic operators act in the loop space as operators of creation and annihilation of curves .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] we remind briefly the properties of our system in the hamiltonian formulation and introduce the unified einstein - maxwell gauge field . in this section",
    "we also describe the hamiltonian formulation for the fermionic system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : loopvar ] we introduce the loop variables and study the poisson algebra structure .",
    "[ sec : loopr ] is the heart of our paper : it concerns constructing the loop representation .",
    "we introduce a @xmath0-algebra of configurational variables , find a representation space in which these configurational variables become operators and , choosing a basis in this space , define `` loop '' operators .",
    "we begin with the action for gravity and matter fields . fix a four - manifold @xmath2 , which is topologically a direct product @xmath3 for some three - manifold @xmath4 . in the framework of ashtekar variables the lagrangian density for gravity",
    "@xmath5 is the functional of an anti - hermitian soldering form @xmath6 and a self - dual connection @xmath7 on @xmath2 @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the determinant of the inverse soldering form and @xmath10 is the curvature tensor of @xmath11 .",
    "self - dual connection field is chosen to be of dimension @xmath12 m , what is convenient because allows one to regard @xmath13 as a usual yang - mills field .",
    "factor @xmath14 in ( [ gravaction ] ) is the fundamental constant ; @xmath14 is set to have a dimension of @xmath12 m so that the action is dimensionless .",
    "other fundamental constants are set to be @xmath15 .",
    "let us note that the action functional ( [ gravaction ] ) is complex ; the fields @xmath16 and @xmath11 are complex dynamical variables of the complexified general relativity system .    the connection @xmath17 defined by @xmath7 and by electromagnetic vector - potencial @xmath18 via @xmath19 acts only on unprimed spinors .",
    "thus , we shall take the dirac lagrangian density for fermionic fields @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( grassmann - valued ) to be @xmath22\\;+        { im\\over { \\surd \\bar 2}}[\\bar \\eta_{a}\\xi^{a}-                                 \\bar \\xi^{a'}\\eta_{a'}]\\bigr ] .\\ ] ]    the lagrangian density for electromagnetic field is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the curvature tensor of @xmath25 ; metric field @xmath26 here is defined as the squared soldering form @xmath27    the total action of the theory is the sum @xmath28 in order to develop the canonical quantization program we should pass on to the hamiltonian framework , carrying out a space+time decomposition in the action functional ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "then the action takes the following form @xmath29    as it is common for generally covariant field theories , the hamiltonian will be the sum of constraints .",
    "the action in this hamiltonian form provides a canonical phase space description of the system .",
    "this section is aimed to discuss the arising poisson structure and to introduce a set of unified coordinates on this phase space .",
    "let us for the moment restrict our consideration only to the part of the hamiltonian descibing the dynamics of the gauge fields .",
    "the last two terms in the hamiltonian are the generators of local gauge transformations on the phase space .",
    "these transformations are : rotations of the complexified spin basis at each spatial point , which form the group @xmath1 , and phase rotations , which form the group @xmath30 ; the gauge fields lie in the corresponsing lie algebras .",
    "therefore , the full gauge group , which is formed by all internal space symmetry transformations , is @xmath31 . from the hamiltonian ,",
    "i.e. geometric , point of view it is superfluous to distinguish the two gauge fields  the dynamical variables of the theory should be a connection on some bundle over the spatial manifold ( which takes values in the lie algebra of the gauge group ) and its conjugate momentum .",
    "thus , we should regard the two independent connection fields of initial lagrange formulation as the two parts of one connection field  the unified einstein - maxwell field .",
    "so we are to choose the new `` coordinates '' on the phase space of the system which will correspond to the unified gauge field .",
    "the expression for the new gauge variables is straightforward .",
    "let us choose the new connection field to be @xmath32 then the initial einstein and maxwell connection fields can be expressed through @xmath33 as follows @xmath34 having introduced the unified connection field @xmath35 we can define the corresponding momentum field @xmath36",
    ". we shall take it in the form @xmath37 so that it is the canonically conjugate to @xmath35 : @xmath38 here @xmath35 is the pullback of @xmath33 to the tree - manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the factor @xmath39 in ( [ momentum ] ) is important ; it provides the correct ( canonical ) commutational relations between the connection field and its momentum ( [ brackets ] ) .",
    "the gravitational and electromagnetic momentum fields can also be expressed through the unified field @xmath40    having these relations it is just an exercise to rewrite the constraints in terms of the unified fields .",
    "the last two terms in the hamiltonian are the gauss law constraints for the gravitational and electromagnetic fields @xmath41 where @xmath42 we can express it in terms of the new lagrange multiplier @xmath43 , so the gauss law constraint for the unified field takes the form @xmath44 where we have introduced @xmath45    the part of the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath46 expressed through the unified variables takes the form @xmath47 again , the factor @xmath39 from ( [ momentum ] ) was necessary to cansel the factor @xmath48 which appeared from the trace operation . here",

    "then one can obtain the poisson brackets between the canonical variables @xmath72 @xmath73 and analogously for @xmath74 fields .      the hamiltonian constraint of the theory consists of the three parts @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "having introduced the unified connection field and the corresponding conjugate momentum , we shall express the hamiltonian constraint in terms of these fields .",

    "it is given by @xmath87    this accomplishes the aim of this section , which was to obtain all the constraints of the hamiltonian framework expressed in terms of the unified gauge and the fermionic fields .",
    "we will conclude by pointing out that in the form ( [ hamilt ] ) the hamiltonian is not polynomial in @xmath80 variables because of the presence of the factor @xmath88 in the electromagnetic part ; this might cause problems in constructing the corresponding quantum operator .",
    "possible solution of the problem was proposed by ashtekar _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "multiplying the hamiltonian constraint by @xmath89 one may restore its polynomial character ; the hamiltonian constraint becomes a density of weight four ( therefore the corresponding lagrange multiplier - lapse function - becomes a density of weight minus three ) .",
    "another possible way to tackle this problem is discussed in @xcite .",
    "in this section we construct gauge invariant non - local functionals of the dynamical variables . these functionals are associated with loops , curves and ribbons so they will play a role of `` loop '' gauge - invariant coordinates on the system s phase space .",

    "a special attention is paid to a graphical representation of the algebra obtained .",
    "the set of variables which we call configurational loop variables will play a crucial role in the quantization procedure .",
    "let us denote the space of the unified connection fields ( the space of connections on a certain @xmath31 bundle over @xmath4 ) by @xmath90 and consider a wilson loop functional on @xmath90 @xmath91 : = \\tr { \\cal p}\\,\\exp{\\oint_{\\g}{\\cal a}},\\ ] ]",

    "loop variables are invariant under retracing operation @xmath111 where @xmath112 means the composition of loops which intersect at a point , @xmath113 is the inverse of a curve @xmath114 .    as configurational loop variables involving fermionic degrees of freedom we will take certain even grassmann algebra elements .",
    "the infinite - dimensional grassmann algebra is generated by the anticommuting complex objects  our dynamical field variables @xmath115 .",

    "it is one of the reasons for which we introduce the loop variables that the quantum hamiltonian operator can be defined as a certain loop limit of an operator constructed from the basic loop operators .",
    "however , the quantities they consider as basic ones turn into zero when the corresponding curve srinks to a point . in this sense",
    "the loop quantities quadratic in a grassmann field can not serve as basic variables . ]",
    "we propose a convinient notation in which any `` loop '' quantity is denoted by a greek letter in parenthesis .",
    "since ends of a curve correspond to the fermionic degrees of freedom , it is convinient to include symbols of fermionic fields in paranthesis on both sides of a loop symbol to get a symbol which describes the mixed quantity .",
    "thus , @xmath108 in the above expression is the open curve with ends marked by @xmath118 ; we will always put @xmath119 at the _ final _ point of a curve and @xmath114 will mark the _ initial _",

    "then for any three curves @xmath107 and @xmath108 intersecting at a point the following identity holds @xmath126 @xmath127 or using graphical notation for @xmath128 + 0.3 in 3 .",
    "the retracing identity @xmath129",
    "so we have introduced the gauge invariant quantities @xmath102 and @xmath130 .",
    "the above identities imply that these quantities are associated not with loops and curves themselves but with classes of equivalence of loops and curves . in the case of pure gravity",
    "these classes are called hoops and it seems reasonable to keep this name and for equivalence classes of curves .",
    "two loops ( or curves ) belong to the same equivalence class ( or hoop ) if they define the same loop quantities for all fields @xmath131 .",
    "these hoop variables form an abelian algebra under the poisson brackets and will play a role of `` coordinates '' in the loop representation .",
    "let us first construct the quantities which do not involve any fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "we associate such momentum variables with piecewise strips , i.e. piecewise ribbons with ends glued @xcite . inserting the momentum field @xmath80 at points of loops",

    "it is induced by the poisson structure on the space of gauge and fermionic fields ( ( [ brackets ] ) and ( [ fermbrackets ] ) respectively ) .",
    "the remaining part of these section is aimed to describe the resulting algebra of loop variables in a graphical form .",

    "they are represented by classes of diffeomorphism equivalent curves , loops and strips .",
    "the algebraic ( induced poisson ) structure on this quotient algebra is given by _ the same relations _",

    "this fact helps one to solve the problem of finding the solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint in the loop representation .",
    "constructing the quantum representation for our system we will mostly follow the programm of asthekar group ( for recent developments see @xcite ) ; however , the approach described below is more `` physical '' because much importance is attached to the visualization of all relations .",
    "the program of quantization of generally covariant field theories proposed in the number of publications ( see @xcite and references therein ) uses the idea to realize the quantum representation space as the representation space of a configurational variables abelian @xmath0-algebra . the construction is an infinite - dimensional generalization of the standart coordinate representation in quantum mechanics : the space of coordinate representation is the represenation space of the abelian algebra of @xmath150 operators , i.e. @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",

    "we have to define a @xmath0-algebra of configurational variables .",
    "the most natural candidate for this algebra is the algebra of our configurational loop variables over complex numbers .",
    "its elements would be complex even grassmann numbers ( i.e. it would be formed by powers of our configurational loop variables @xmath102 , @xmath158 ) and we would define an involution as the @xmath54-operator .",
    "one , however , runs into some problems on this way .",
    "first , because of the complexity of the ashtekar connection , the parallel transport matrix @xmath159 $ ] is _ not _ unitary ( it belongs to a larger group @xmath31 ) ; therefore , our loop variables behave somewhat complicately under the complex conjugation operation ; for example , given any loop @xmath108 there may not exists such a loop @xmath104 that @xmath160 ; .",
    "but it is still not the worst .",
    "because of the non - unitarity of @xmath161 the elements @xmath102 are _ not _ bounded so the natural sup - norm @xmath162 @xmath163 does _ not _ exists on this algebra . owing to these facts the case of complex @xmath164 ( or the case of lorentzian general relativity ) remained a problem by the last time . the situation get somewhat changed after the coherent state transform had appeared @xcite .",
    "recall that the complex ashtekar connection @xmath164 satisfies the following _ reality conditions _ although in the given form the reality conditions are non - polynomial in @xmath165 , there is a form in which they are polynomial .",
    "@xmath166 thus , being the complex @xmath1 connection field , @xmath167 bears some additional `` unphysical information '' and one can expect that only its `` real '' , @xmath168 part must play a role in the quantization procedure .",
    "this leads to the idea to consider quantum states @xmath169 $ ] which depend only on the connection @xmath164 and do not depend on its complex conjugate @xmath170 .",
    "such functionals @xmath171 are called holomorphic , so the first step to eliminate the superfluous degrees of freedom from the quantization procedure is to consider a representation of lorentzian general relativity in the space of holomorphic functionals of the ashekar connection .",
    "then , as it has been shown in @xcite , there exists an isomorphism ( given by the coherent state transform ) between this space and the space of functionals of the @xmath168 connection .",
    "therefore , having built a quantum representation of the @xmath168 variables algebra , one will have the representation of lorentzian genaral relativity given by the coherent state transform .",
    "so , according to this scheme , we have got to construct a representation of the @xmath168 variables algebra . for the case of pure gravity this actually has been done in @xcite and our aim is to show that the construction allows a natural enlargening to the case when the gauge field and the fermionic matter present .",
    "the @xmath0-algebra of the @xmath168 configurational variables is described as follows .",
    "it is formed by the same `` loop '' quantities @xmath172 ( with the multiplication , additive and @xmath54- operations from the grassmann algebra ) .",
    "the only difference is that the parallel transport matrix @xmath159 $ ] becomes now unitary , so it has a bounded trace and there exists the sup - norm ( [ supnorm ] ) for the loop algebra elements @xmath102 .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath159 $ ] leads also to the following simple properties of our algebra generators with respect to the @xmath54-operation :    * operation @xmath54 acts on the loop quantities @xmath102 as simple complex conjugation and @xmath173 * the action of @xmath54-operation on the fermionic `` loop '' variables is the consequence of our momentum fields definition ( [ momdefine ] ) and is given by @xmath174 these relations are , in fact , the reality conditions which one should impose on the fermionic phase space in order to single out its real part .",
    "it is worthwile to note that we have chosen the form in which they are non - polynomial in the @xmath132 variable ( because of the presence of @xmath9 ) .    next ,",
    "let us introduce a norm which makes the algebra of `` loop '' elements a @xmath0-algebra .",
    "the algebra is spanned by powers of the `` loop '' generators ; i.e. it is spanned by a set of elements which are labeled by pairs of points with curves connecting them ( this correspond to a product of @xmath158 generators ) and by loops ( this correspond to a product of different @xmath102 s ) .",
    "we suppose that algebra elements depend no more than on a countable set of points @xmath175 and loops @xmath176 , so arbitrary algebra element @xmath177 can be written as a functional of the type here k of this `` loops '' @xmath108 are those connecting points @xmath178 where fields @xmath179 are taken .",
    "@xmath180,\\ldots , u[\\g_{n}],\\ldots).\\ ] ] we call such functionals the cylindical functionals .",
    "function @xmath181 is assumed to be a continuous function of all its arguments .",
    "we shall introduce a norm on our algebra by means of the scalar product which we define in the appendix .",
    "this scalar product has the form ( see ( [ scalprod ] ) ) @xmath182^{\\dagger } \\phi_{2}(\\xi,\\etabar ) \\exp {           \\bigl \\ { \\sum(\\xi)^{\\dagger}(\\xi)+            \\sum(\\etabar)^{\\dagger}(\\etabar)\\bigr \\ }   } \\ ;            d(\\xi,\\xi^{\\dagger},\\etabar,\\etabar^{\\dagger}),\\ ] ] where the integration is carried over the fermionic fields ; the result does not depend on @xmath183 : it is a cylindrical functional of connection field ( i.e. it depends on @xmath184 as a continuous function @xmath185,\\ldots , u[\\g_{n}])$ ] )",
    ". therefore , the following function of our algebra elements exists @xmath186 which we will show has all the properties of a norm .    1 .",
    "first , @xmath187 @xmath188 2 .   for two elements",
    "@xmath189 which do not contain fermionic fields the property @xmath190 is obvious . when for example @xmath177 is a purely fermionic while @xmath191 does not contain fermionic fields the property still holds ,",
    "because then @xmath192 does not depend on the connection field , as it follows from our scalar product definition .",
    "so we have to check this property only for the case when both @xmath177 and @xmath191 contain fermionic fields ; we may always consider one of these elements , for instance @xmath177 , to be a generator , i.e. a product of the fermionic `` loop '' quantities .",
    "in the case when @xmath193 it can be explicitly checked that @xmath194 .",
    "for instance , @xmath195 so we have the property required . in the opposite case ,",
    "when @xmath191 does not comprise any curves from those which compose the generator @xmath177 , the scalar product definition gives @xmath196 and the property is satisfied .",
    "so we have only check it for the case when @xmath197 , where @xmath198 does not contain any curves from those composing @xmath177 ( what is equivalent to @xmath199 ) . in this case",
    "it turns out also that @xmath200 , so @xmath201 , and , because any fermionic generator has the property that @xmath202 , we finally have that @xmath203 .",
    ", we have to check the property @xmath204 which makes an algebra with involution a @xmath0-algebra .",
    "because for the loop quantities this property is obvious , it should be checked only for the fermionic generators .",
    "the explicit calculation gives @xmath205 @xmath206 for the elements of higher orders in the configurational fermionic quantities the required property follows from the fact that for any two such quantities @xmath189 @xmath196 .",
    "so the algebra of configurational `` loop '' variables becomes an abelian * -algebra with norm @xmath207 ( which satisfies the relation @xmath208 ) and we can take a completion to obtain a @xmath0-algebra of configurational `` loop '' variables .      having the @xmath0-algebra of configurational variables we are at the point to implement the standard representation theory .",
    "according to gelfand an abelian @xmath0-algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of all continuous functions on its spectrum .",
    "let us give the description of the spectrum of our loop variables algebra .",
    "denote by @xmath90 the space of all ( satisfying the certain boundary conditions ) fields @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are complex spinor fields ( _ non_-grassmann - valued ) which take values in fibres @xmath212 of some @xmath213-bundle over @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding space quotient by the gauge transformations will be @xmath214 where @xmath215 .",
    "then each point of @xmath214 defines a linear homomorphism @xmath216 from the loop variables algebra to @xmath217 ( a character ) as follows : @xmath218 @xmath219 the spectrum is the set of all characters so we have that the points of @xmath214 distinguish the elements of our algebra spectrum ; it is easy to show that @xmath214 is dence ( in gelfand topology ) in the spectrum , so we will denote the later by @xmath220 .",
    "this space becomes a quantum configurational space of our theory .",
    "as in the case of pure gravity its limit points are distributions which we shall regard as generalized fields ( in the sense of dirac s @xmath221-function ) .",
    "we will denote the generalized fields by the same symbols @xmath222 ; so @xmath223 .",
    "thus , the space of `` loop '' algebra representation is the space @xmath224 of all continuous functions over @xmath220 .",
    "this space , however , is too large to define integral and differential calculus on it .",
    "the construction of a smoler space , measure and differential calculus on this smoler space has been proposed by ashtekar _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they proposed to regard the quantum configuration space of an infinite - dimensional case as _ the projective limit _ of finite - dimensional configurational spaces of gravity on floating lattices .",
    "then the representation space becomes the space @xmath225 of cylindrical functionals over the algebra spectrum . by a cylindrical functional on @xmath214",
    "we understand a map @xmath171 of the form @xmath226 @xmath227 one can develop a calculus on @xmath225 by means of the projective limit from the finite - dimensional configurational spaces @xcite .",
    "thus , one can introduce a measure @xmath228 on @xmath225 ; this gives rise to the hilbert representation space @xmath229 .    in order to construct the _ loop representation",
    "_ we choose a certain basis in the representation space @xmath225 so that the loop variables become in this basis simple operators which can be interpreted in terms of operators of creation and annihilation .",
    "the idea is very similar to one , which is used to define , for example , the momentum representation in quantum mechanics .",
    "one chooses the basis formed by all proper states @xmath230 of the momentum operator ( the corresponding waive - functions are @xmath231 ) and defines all the operators by their action on states from this basis .",
    "we introduce the basis of `` loop '' states which in some sense are proper states of momentum loop operators and the loop operators become the operators of creation and annihilation of loops and curves in this basis .    it is convinient to use the dirac s notations and denote the following functionals in our space by dirac s kets @xmath232 depending on whether @xmath121 has ends or not ; and in a similar way a `` multiloop '' state is @xmath233",
    "the order in which loops are taken to compose a multiloop state is not important .",
    "these states form the basis although , in the absence of a scalar product in the representation space , it is note quite legitimate to call the set of states which we will introduce a basis , we use this term because there _ exists _ a scalar product in which the set of states is a basis .",
    "note also , that this basis is not countable . in the representation space and we will call them n - loop states .",
    "the configurational loop variables become operators of multiplication and the dirac s notations allow us to express their action simply by @xmath234 @xmath235 in a similar manner they act on states containing more `` loops '' .",
    "we see , therefore , that if one thinks about the state @xmath236 as about a state containing n `` loops '' , then the action of the configurational operators consists in simply the adding of one more `` loop '' to a state .",
    "it is tempting to regard these operators as `` creation '' operators .",
    "thus , the basis can be obtained acting on a cyclic vector ( unity functional ) by the creation `` loop '' operators .",
    "let us exemine the basis introduced more thoroughly .",
    "due to the identities satisfied by wilson functionals this basis is overcomplete .",
    "its elements are linear dependent , so some of them may be rewritten as linear combinations of others .",
    "for example , any three - loop state may be first realized as the state with three loops intersecting at a point and then reduced to the sum of states containing two and one loop    0.2 in    thus , as it has been found by gambini and pullin @xcite , any n - loop state may be reduced to a linear combination of two- and one - loop states .",
    "consider then a state containing two loops and one open curve .",
    "repeating the above procedure , we may reduce this state to a linear combination of states containing one loop , one open curve and merely open curve states    0.2 in    thus , any state containing n curves and m loops may be reduced to a linear combination of states containing n curves and one loop or n - curve states ( the number of ends in a state can not be reduced ) .",
    "the set of irreduceble elements of our basis consists of states    * n curves no loops , n = @xmath237 , * n curves one loop , n = @xmath237 , * two loops .    having this `` loop '' basis in the representation space we are ready to define the action of other operators by defining it on the basis elements .      in the last part of this section",
    "we construct the representation of the classical momentum `` loop '' variables in the space considered , i.e. we build operators @xmath238 so that their commutational relations coincide to the first degrees in @xmath239 with the poisson brackets of their classical analogs . note",
    "that we represent the poisson brackets by _ commutational _ relations even though the variables involve grassmann fields .",
    "the advantage of the built representation is that we have simultaneously two equivalent descriptions of operators action .",
    "the first , visual one is based on a graphical representation of states and operators , i.e. on dealing with dirac s kets @xmath240 .",
    "the second description is based on representing states as functionals of generalized fields and operators act in the space of functionals . in this",
    "later one there is a naive way to define the momentum operators ; one shold just use the corresponding classical expressions and replace all momentum fields by the functional derivative operators .",
    "the resulting operators will act in the space of functionals of generalized fields @xmath241 $ ]    the `` right '' and `` left '' functional derivatives here have nothing to do with the grassmann properties : this is a useful convention which implies the rules by which our fermionic momentum operators act on the loop states .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that @xmath242 and    @xmath243 ( we omited the integration over the momentum fields in this formula ) , so the right and left vectors over our momentum operators mean simply that the @xmath244 operator glues a curve to the right side of a curve in our ordering ( i.e. to the begining point ) while @xmath245 glues a curve to the left ( to the final point ) .",
    "this also explains the usage of @xmath246 symbols for our loop quantities : one simply has to replace @xmath247 or @xmath248 pair by the composition operation @xmath249 .",
    "@xmath250 : =             i\\;{\\delta\\over\\delta\\a_{a}}\\psi[\\a ] ;   \\nonumber \\\\ \\pitil_{a}\\to{\\hat{\\pitil}}_{a},\\quad({\\hat{\\pitil}}_{a}\\circ\\psi)[f , g ] : =             i\\;{\\lvect{\\delta}\\over\\delta f^{a}}\\psi[f , g ] ;     \\\\ \\label{funcder } % % following line can not be broken before 80 char \\omegatil^{a}\\to{\\hat{\\omegatil}}^{a},\\quad({\\hat{\\omegatil}}^{a}\\circ\\psi)[f , g ]          : = i\\;{\\rvect{\\delta}\\over\\delta g_{a}}\\psi[f , g ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    no problems arise there with operator ordering because functional derivative operators commute when they act at different space points .",
    "these construction leads to the well defined operators , whose action on the introduced basis vectors can be described graphically . moreover",
    ", this latter graphical description can be used as an alternative definition of the `` momentum '' operators .",
    "we shall give the result in the both descriptions .",
    "first , let us define the `` strip '' operator , which describes gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "it is represented by the following operator @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the loop from the loop family covering @xmath137 which intersects with the loop @xmath121 ( when there is no intersection of @xmath121 with the strip the result is zero ) .",
    "the graphical representation of this operator is    0.5 in    i.e. the operator adds the loop to a one loop state and glues these loops in the only way compatible with their orientation . as we have stated above ,",
    "the `` loop '' states are the `` proper '' states of our momentum operators in the sense that the result of their action on a @xmath253-loop state is also a @xmath253-loop state ( when the strip intersects more than one loop from the state the result will be the sum of @xmath253-loop states ) .",
    "let us define the fermionic `` momentum '' operators .",
    "the construction is straightforward from the form of their poisson brackets with the configurational variables ( one can also obtain the following expressions using functional derivative operators from ( [ funcder ] ) ) .",
    "we shall define @xmath254 here we integrated over the initial point of the curve @xmath108 in order to have the same density at the right and the left sides of the expression and the curve @xmath108 at the right side is that one from the family @xmath255 whose final point coincides with the initial point of @xmath121 .",
    "the graphical description of this operator is    0.5 in    i.e. it prolonges @xmath121 by adding the corresponding curve to the final point .",
    "this , linear in the fermionic momentum field operator does not change the number of open ends in a state .",
    "the other linear in the momentum field operator is defined in a similar way @xmath256    0.5 in    the only difference with the previous operator is that this one adds the corresponding curve to the initial point of @xmath121 . and ,",
    "finally , the operator quadratic in the fermionic momentum fields is defined as @xmath257    0.5 in    that is , the operator glues two open ends of a curve , converting it into a loop . acting on more complicated states this operator also reduces ( by two ) the number of open ends in a state .",
    "the result is the sum of states ; in each of these states the operator glues together two open ends ( of different kind ) , and the sum goes through all possible pairs of open ends .    restoring the @xmath239 factor in all relations one can easy check that the above defenitions really give a representation of the classical algebra , i.e. that the commutators among defined operators ( scalled by the factor @xmath258 ) turn into their classical analogs when @xmath239 goes to zero .",
    "there are few words left to be said about the solving of the diffeomorphism constraint in our approach .",
    "this is particularly simple while describing the states and operators graphically , because the elements of quantum algebra are described in terms of geometrical objects and diffeomorphism constraint is represented in quantum case by a generator of transformations of these objects .",
    "commutational relations are also written in terms of geometrical objects and the relations similar in the form hold for all representatives of the diffeomorphism equivalent classes of objects . in order to pick up the physical states ,",
    "i.e. to solve the constraint , one should find a representation of the `` physical '' operators which lie in the corresonding quotient algebra .",
    "it is easy to see that in the approach described this will be the representaion in the space of equivalence classes of loops and curves and all `` physical '' operators will act on classes of diffeomorphic equivalent objects .",
    "there is also another , more rigorous approach for solving the diffeomorphism constraint , which is based on the description of our quantum operators as operators in the space of functionals ; this approach is given by the averaging procedure from @xcite .",
    "we have constructed the representation for our quantum system in which the classical loop variables became operators in the `` loop '' space .",
    "the representation we built differs from the loop representation of pure gravity in the following important points :    1 .   unlike loops describing pure gravitational exitations , loops and curves of the unified theory are oriented .",
    "2 .   the momentum loop operators ( corresponding to the gauge as well as to the fermionic degrees of freedom ) act on the `` loop '' states merely prolonging these `` loops '' in the only compatible with their orientation way .",
    "one can propose an interesting classification of the constructed `` loop '' operators in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we have seen that the operators corresponding to the configurational loop variables act by adding a `` loop '' to a state , so it is natural to regard them as creation operators .",
    "this terminology is especially good for the operator represented by a curve because open ends of a curve in our formalism correspond to fermions .",
    "it can easily be shown that this operator actually creates a pair of `` fermions '' of different charge sign .",
    "indeed , one can define the charge of a quantum state as the eighenvalue of the charge operator for this state .",
    "classical charge is the generator of gauge transformations ; it is given by the quantity @xmath259 where @xmath260 is an arbitrary ( real , integrable ) function .",
    "one can define the quantum charge operator with the regularization procedure of point splitting .",
    "the result is a well defined operator which acts only on the open ends of curves in a state .",
    "each final point on a curve gives @xmath82 while initial points give @xmath261 .",
    "thus , the result of this operator s action on _ any _ state in our representation is zero .",
    "this means that our `` fermions '' are born only in pairs with their `` anti - particles''and that all the states in our representation are electrically neutral .",
    "the operators corresponding to the quantities linear in momentum fields do not change neither number of loops nor number of open ends in a state ; in this sense the `` loop '' states are the `` eighenstates '' of these operators . and",
    "finaly , there are momentum operators of higher orders which change the number of `` loops '' in a `` loop '' state ; they create or annihilate `` loops '' depending on a state they act on .",
    "this completes the description of quantum kinematics for our unified system .",
    "the important problem which has not been discussed in this paper is the construction of a scalar product in the representation space .",
    "there are several points in our scheme where a scalar product is nesessary .",
    "first , having defined the `` loop '' operators with respect to the `` basis '' of `` loop '' states , one should have a scalar product in which the set of `` loop '' states becomes a basis .",
    "second , in order to have a hilbert representation space we need a scalar product with respect to wich the space @xmath262 is complete . and , finally , one needs a scalar product so that the properties of our operators with respect to the hermitian conjugation coincide with the corresponding properties of the classical quantities with respect to the @xmath54-operation .",
    "this collection of problems for the system considered is discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us conclude by pointing out a possible physical meaning of the formalism obtained .",
    "it describes the unified theory , i.e. the gravitational and electromagnetic fields enter the formalism only in a certain combination . on the quantum level exitations of these fields",
    "are described by loops and curves so the formalism predicts that there do not exist pure gravitational or pure electromagnetic quantum exitations and these fields appear always only _",
    "i am very grateful to yuri shtanov for helpful discussion , comments , and criticism .",
    "i thank carlo rovelli and thomas thiemann whose critics was very useful .",
    "i would especially like to thank professor p.i.fomin whose encouragement made this work possible .",
    "let us introduce a scalar product in the space of cylindrical functionals of fermionic fields .",
    "we call a functional @xmath263 on the grassmann algebra cylindrical if it depends on fields @xmath179 taken no more than in a countable set of points @xmath264 here we denote @xmath265 . then , having the involution @xmath54 , we can define a scalar product of two cylindrical functionals @xmath266 as @xmath267^{\\dagger } \\phi_{2}(\\xi,\\etabar)\\;\\exp{\\sum_{p}(\\xi_{p}^{\\dagger})_{a}(\\xi_{p})^{a } +                  \\sum_{p'}(\\etabar_{p'}^{\\dagger})^{a}(\\etabar_{p'})^{a}}\\ ] ] @xmath268 @xmath269 here @xmath270 is to be understood as a cylindrical functional of the fields @xmath271 .",
    "the two sums and products are taken over the points @xmath178 which the functionals @xmath266 depend on .",
    "the integral here is the integral over fermionic grassmann variables ; it acquires a sense if we define the following basic operations on the grassmann algebra @xmath272 and @xmath273 thus , the result of integration of any functional @xmath181 is defined as proportional to the coefficient near the highest order non - zero term in the expansion of @xmath181 by powers of the fermionic fields . then the integration in ( [ scalprod ] ) gives a complex number , so this expression really defines a scalar product in the space of cylindrical functionals .",
