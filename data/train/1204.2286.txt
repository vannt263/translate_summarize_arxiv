    "<S> in bilayer graphene , the phase diagram in the plane of a strain - induced bare nematic term , @xmath0 , and a top - bottom gates voltage imbalance , @xmath1 , is obtained by solving the gap equation in the random - phase approximation . at nonzero @xmath2 and @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram consists of two hybrid spin - valley symmetry - broken phases with both nontrivial nematic and mass - type order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding phases are separated by a critical line of first- and second - order phase transitions at small and large values of @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a critical end point , where the line of first - order phase transitions terminates , is predicted . for @xmath4 , a pure gapped state with a broken spin - valley symmetry is the ground state of the system . as @xmath0 increases , the nematic order parameter increases , and the gap weakens in the hybrid state . for @xmath5 , a quantum second - order phase transition from the hybrid state into a pure gapless nematic state </S>",
