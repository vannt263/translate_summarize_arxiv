    "mass segregation is one of the manifestations of two - body relaxation in collisional stellar systems .",
    "kinetic energy exchanges between stars with different masses cause a slowing down of the heaviest one , which spirals toward the centre of the system in favour of a velocity enhancement of the lighter one , which , instead , migrates toward the outskirt . since the time scale of this process is the dynamical friction ( df ) timescale @xmath1 @xcite , which depends on the local velocity dispersion and ( especially ) on the local density of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is natural to expect different stellar systems to show different levels of mass segregation .    in this respect ,",
    "blue straggler stars ( bsss ) have been used as powerful observational test particles to probe mass segregation in globular clusters ( gcs ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because bsss in gcs have a mass of @xmath2 ( @xcite ) which is larger than the main - sequence turn - off ( ms - to ) mass and the average stellar mass in the system ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) .",
    "hence , bsss experience significant df against \" normal  cluster stars .",
    "moreover , these objects are relatively bright , with visual magnitudes up to 2.5 dex above the ms - to point ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they can be efficiently distinguished from the normal low - mass stars in the cluster . indeed , previous works largely demonstrated that bsss tend to be more centrally concentrated than normal cluster populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and different levels of segregation have been found in different gcs ( see , e.g. , figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite proposed to use the shape of the normalized bss radial distribution as an indicator of the level of dynamical evolution experienced by a stellar system .    following this approach gcs",
    "can be grouped in three main families ( _ family i , ii and iii _ ) of increasing dynamical ages on the basis of the different shapes of their bss radial distribution . in the scenario proposed by @xcite",
    ", df is the main phenomenon that drives the bss sedimentation toward the center of the system .",
    "family i gcs _ , where bsss follow the same radial distribution of the reference population , are dynamically young systems , where df has not started yet to segregate these heavy objects , not even those orbiting the most central regions . in _ family ii gcs _",
    ", where the bss radial distribution is bimodal with a central peak , a minimum in the intermediate region , followed by a rising branch in the external part , the action of df progressively affected bsss at increasingly larger distances from the centre : these systems are dynamically intermediate - age gcs . in particular , four different _ sub - families ii _ , with progressively increasing dynamical ages according to the increasing radial position of the minimum of their bss distribution , have been defined by @xcite ( 2012 ; see their figure 2 ) . finally , in _ family iii gcs _",
    ", where the bss radial distribution shows only the central peak and then monotonically decreases at increasing distance from the cluster center , df nominally segregated the entire population of bsss : these are dynamically - old gcs .",
    "theoretical confirmations of this result have been searched by means of semi - analytic and numerical approaches .",
    "@xcite excluded the possibilty that the shape of the bss radial distribution in family ii clusters is due to a combination of different df times for different mass groups in a multi - mass system , thus confirming that the scenario proposed in @xcite is the most likely explanation of the observed shapes of the bss distribution .",
    "the recent numerical work by @xcite provided some additional support to the observations , confirming the formation of a sharp central peak , which remains a stable feature over time , regardless of the initial concentration of the system . in spite of a noisy behaviour",
    ", a bimodal distribution is seen in several cases , and in the most advanced stages , the distribution becomes monotonic .",
    "however , in that work , the minimum of the bss distribution is not always easily identifiable , and its outward migration occurs over a very short timescale , thus suggesting an insufficient level of realism of the adopted models .",
    "admittedly , in @xcite the total number of particles was limited to only @xmath5 , and the mass spectrum was roughly modelled with only three mass bins .",
    "moreover no populations of white dwarfs ( wds ) and dark remnants ( drs ) , composed of neutron stars ( nss ) and stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) were included . the dark component ( bhs and nss )",
    "is thought to substantially influence the cluster dynamics and structural properties @xcite .",
    "in fact , since their masses are significantly larger than the average , drs are thought to be the main drivers of the cluster core - collapse ( cc ) phase , forming close binaries that strongly interact dynamically with the other stars approaching the core during the evolution .",
    "hence , for the proper interpretation of the observational results , more realistic models of gcs are needed . in the present paper",
    "we discuss a set of simulations that , with respect to those in @xcite , include @xmath6 a significantly larger number ( @xmath7 ) of particles , @xmath8 a much finer mass - spectrum obtained from the evolution of a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , and @xmath9 a population of drs . the number of drs in present - day gcs is poorly constrained and , during the last 30 years",

    "the simulations exploit the graphic processing unit ( gpu ) version of the direct @xmath10-body code @xcite on the supercomputer at indiana university , bloomington .",
    "we performed ten different runs in order to explore both the effect of various percentages of drs , and the effect of different cluster concentrations , on gc dynamical evolution .",
    "the initial conditions have been built as follows .",
    "starting from @xmath11 stars belonging to a @xcite imf , in the mass interval @xmath12 m_\\odot$ ] and assuming a metallicity @xmath13 , we evolved the system for 12 gyr , by means of the stellar evolution recipes implemented in the sse version of the software @xcite .",
    "this procedure generated a population of wds and drs descending from the evolution of stars with initial masses @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , nss have masses peaked at @xmath15 , with a tail up to @xmath16 , while bh masses range between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "to all the runs we also added @xmath18 bsss , modeled as single particles with a mass of @xmath19 . the number of bsss in our runs , although being overabundant with respect to what observed in real gcs , guarantees enough statistics to limit stochastic noise in the results .",
    "we assume the particles follow a king @xcite model distribution with no primordial mass segregation . in order to explore the effect of different concentrations , we have chosen two different values of the king central dimensionless potential : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    with the aim of exploring how cluster dynamics depends on the presence and content of heavy objects , and to isolate the effect of bhs from that of nss , for each of the adopted @xmath22 values we ran five simulations by varying , in the initial conditions ,",
    "the percentage of drs retained within the system : @xmath6 in simulations @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) no drs have been retained ( hence , bsss are the most massive objects in the cluster ) ; @xmath8 in runs @xmath25 and @xmath26 we assumed that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , of nss have been retained , while all bhs have been ejected ; @xmath9 in simulations @xmath29 and @xmath30 we assumed that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , of nss and bhs have been retained .",
    "the number of nss , bhs , and bsss in the initial conditions of each run are summarized in table [ run_table ] .",
    "we start the presentation of our results with a brief description of the evolution of the structural properties of our simulated clusters , and the effects of the presence of drs .",
    "figures [ fig_lag5 ] and [ fig_lag8 ] show the evolution of the @xmath31 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 number lagrangian radii of particles belonging to different populations in the simulations with no drs and in those also including bhs , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "in particular , we compare the evolution of the lagrangian radii of bsss ( i.e. , all the particles with mass @xmath33 ; blue lines ) , of what we call _ reference _ population ( ref ) , corresponding to all the particles with masses between 0.75 and @xmath34 ( red lines ) , and of the overall system , including all particles irrespective of their masses ( grey lines ) .",
    "moreover , for the runs with bhs , we also show in black the evolution of the dr population ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the figures clearly show that the cluster dynamical evolution is highly affected by the presence and amount of drs , and also depends on the initial concentration of the system . quite interestingly , this is true not only in the innermost cluster regions ( as sampled by the @xmath31 and @xmath27 lagrangian radii ) , but the effects also extend much outward , with large differences even at radial distances including @xmath32 of the populations .    the analysis of the results obtained for @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lag5 ] ) shows that if no drs are present ( left - hand column ) bsss drive the cluster toward cc .",
    "this is indeed expected ( see also @xcite ) , since in that case , bsss are the most massive objects within the system .",
    "the time evolution of the lagrangian radii in the cases where only nss are retained ( namely , simulations @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) is very similar to that with no drs ( thus , we provide no explicit figures for these runs ) , since the large majority of nss has masses comparable to that of bsss .",
    "hence , the main effect of including a dr population made of nss only is that the collapse is driven by these objects and bsss segregate just at a slightly slower rate than in the case with no drs at all . in the @xmath39 and even more in the @xmath40 simulations , instead",
    ", drs undergo a rapid decoupling from the other populations , forming a subsystem that quickly sinks toward the centre ( see the black curves in the central and the right columns of fig .",
    "[ fig_lag5 ] ) .",
    "clearly this behaviour is due to the subsystem of bhs , which have masses significantly larger than bsss and nss .",
    "analogous results have been found and discussed also by @xcite and @xcite , and again very recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the effect of bhs on the time evolution of the bss and ref lagrangian radii is negligible if a retention fraction of only 10% is assumed .",
    "in fact , their value in the @xmath39 run is almost the same , at any fixed value of time @xmath41 , as in the @xmath42 ( and the @xmath37 ) case . in the @xmath43 simulation , after the initial phase of rapid dr decoupling , the inner lagrangian radii of these heavy objects stay approximately constant up to @xmath44 , then decrease steadily in time , closely followed by the lagrangian radii of bsss , which therefore start to participate in driving the overall cluster evolution , similarly to what happens in the @xmath45 run . instead ,",
    "for @xmath46 the effect played by bhs is much stronger .",
    "after the initial decoupling from the rest of the system , drs evolve at almost constant lagrangian radii for approximately 6 initial relaxation times , while the other stellar components migrate much more gently inward : the lagrangian radii of all populations are systematically larger , at the same evolutionary time , with respect to what observed in the @xmath43 case , and the difference between the lagrangian radii of the bss and the ref populations is smaller .",
    "the lagrangian radii of bsss start to approach those of drs at @xmath47 , while the same happens much earlier in the @xmath43 run .",
    "the overall system reacts with a continuos expansion of @xmath48 ( grey line in the bottom right panel ) .",
    "the presence and the amount of bhs in the system has a strong impact on the rate at which the dynamical evolution of bsss and refs proceeds : in particular , the evolution of the level of mass segregation of the bss population is increasingly inhibited and delayed as the adopted dr retention fraction increases .",
    "in fact , while the time of cc of the visible component is @xmath49 if no drs or only nss are present , in the simulations including also bhs , it increases to @xmath50 for a 10% dr retention fraction , and further to @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "these behaviours can be explained as an effect of dynamical heating due to the population of bhs , which inhibits mass segregation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inibhition of the mass segregation , due to the heating from a bh subsystem , resembles what @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have found in the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) .",
    "a recent study by @xcite has also shown that the lack of segregation observed in ngc 6101 might be due to a population of bhs , a result consistent with our findings .",
    "similar general comments as above also apply to the case of a much more concentrated system ( @xmath53 , in place of @xmath36 ) , where the impact of drs including a population of bhs is even more apparent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_lag8 ] ) .",
    "overall the time evolution is much faster than in the @xmath36 case , indicating that increasing the cluster concentration accelerates the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "if drs are absent , the inner lagrangian radii ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) of both bsss and ref stars rapidly decrease in time until the cc ( the rapid fluctuation in @xmath54 and @xmath55 are simply a consequence of the ejection of bss binaries ) , while @xmath48 of the ref population remains almost constant during the entire evolution .",
    "if nss and bhs are included ( central and right - hand columns ) all populations segregate much more slowly and the difference between the bss and the ref lagrangian radii is smaller at any fixed evolutionary times . in the @xmath56 run ,",
    "drs rapidly decouple from the rest of the system , then their inner lagrangian radii expand significantly and start to re - contract only after @xmath57 , closely followed by bsss .",
    "hence , according to what expected , massive objects ( especially stellar - mass bhs ) are found to play a fundamental role in the cluster dynamics , driving the cc of visible stars and determining its timescale .",
    "the time evolution of the lagrangian radii discussed in the previous section provides precious information about the processes of segregation and expansion of various stellar populations .",
    "although our simulations are still idealized and not meant to be directly compared to observational data , it is important to identify and follow the evolution of mass segregation indicators that can be more easily adopted in observational studies of the segregation of bss and ref populations .",
    "many previous studies have shown that different gcs are characterized by different cumulative radial distributions , corresponding to different levels of bss segregation in the central regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we therefore study how the cumulative radial distributions of bsss and refs depend on the simulated cluster properties . in order to highlight the inner distance scale , where the effect of df is the most evident",
    ", we choose to express the radial distance from the cluster centre in logarithmic units . since in all simulations we assume no initial mass segregation ( see sect .",
    "[ nbody ] ) , at @xmath58 all populations are perfectly mixed and the bss and the ref distributions are superimposed .",
    "however , as time increases , bsss migrate toward the cluster centre more rapidly than the ref population ( see figs . [ fig_lag5 ] and [ fig_lag8 ] ) and the two corresponding cumulative radial distributions start to separate from each other",
    ".    for illustrative purposes , figure [ cumu_w8 ] shows the cumulative radial distributions of bsss and refs ( blue and red lines , respectively ) for the @xmath59 run , at four different evolutionary times ( normalized to the initial half - mass relaxation time of the run ; see labels in the figure ) . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the radial distance is expressed in units of the half - mass radius of the ref population at the considered time .",
    "a notable feature in the figure is that the separation between the blue and the red lines increases with time , with the bss population always being more centrally segregated ( i.e. , with a steeper cumulative distribution ) than the ref stars .",
    "this is due to df that preferentially affects the heavier component ( bsss , with respect to refs ) , making these objects more rapidly migrate toward the cluster centre .",
    "figure [ cfr_cumu ] compares the cumulative radial distributions obtained for the four models including bhs ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath60 and @xmath59 ) at a fixed evolutionary time , @xmath61 ( when the @xmath62 simulation stops ) . in line with what discussed in the previous sections , we find that bsss are more centrally segregated for the lowest dr retention fraction ( at fixed value of @xmath22 ) and for the largest cluster concentration ( at fixed dr retention fraction ) .",
    "in particular , the accelerating effect on mass segregation due to a larger cluster concentration is clearly dominant in the case of a small population of drs ( @xmath27 retention fraction ) , while it is almost cancelled or even overcome if drs become sufficiently numerous .",
    "in fact , for a fixed @xmath28 retention fraction the cumulative radial distributions in the @xmath36 and @xmath53 cases are quite alike , with the latter becoming different from zero at only slightly lower radii than in the @xmath36 case ( compare panels labeled with @xmath40 and @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ cfr_cumu ] ) .",
    "such an effect is even more apparent from the comparison of the @xmath39 and @xmath59 radial distributions : in spite of a smaller concentration ( and thanks to a lower fraction of drs ) both stellar populations are more concentrated and the two cumulative distributions are more separated in the former case ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the results discussed above suggest that the separation between the cumulative radial distributions can be used to measure the level of bss central segregation with respect to a lighter cluster population taken as reference .",
    "we quantitatively define this new indicator as the area between the bss and the ref cumulative radial distributions in the @xmath63 plane , and we name it @xmath0 .    for perfectly mixed populations ( as it is the case at @xmath58 in our models ) , such a parameter must be equal to zero .",
    "then , @xmath0 is expected to become positive because the effect of df is stronger on bsss ( heavier ) than on the ( lighter ) ref stars , and the cumulative radial distributions of the two populations therefore start to separate from each other .",
    "according to the scenario presented by @xcite , as time passes , the value of @xmath0 is expected to increase progressively , since bsss orbiting at increasingly larger distances from the cluster centre sink to the bottom of the potential well and the increase of a+ with time corresponds to the formation and the growth of the central peak of the normalized bss distribution .",
    "[ fig_area_trh ] shows that @xmath0 always increases with time and confirms that this parameter is indeed a sensitive indicator of the bss sedimentation process .",
    "the figure confirms that nss alone have a negligible impact on the rate of central bss segregation : in fact , for a given value of @xmath22 , there is no significant difference between the models with different percentages of such objects ( see , for instance , the red and the cyan dashed lines : @xmath37 and @xmath38 runs , respectively ) , nor between these models and those with the same @xmath22 but no drs ( compare the lines above with the grey one , @xmath42 , in the figure ) .",
    "instead , bhs clearly appear to play a crucial role , significanlty slowing down the evolution of the system ( see colored solid lines in the figure ) .",
    "in particular , we note that for a given concentration ( @xmath22 ) and time ( @xmath41 ) , the values of @xmath0 are larger for models with a smaller bh retention . on the other hand , for a given time and a given retention fraction , @xmath0 is larger for models with a larger initial concentration . at",
    "any given value of @xmath41 , the largest values of @xmath0 are found for models with the largest concentration and the smallest bh retention fraction ( @xmath60 ) , while the smaller values of @xmath0 are found with lower concentration models with larger bh retention fraction ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "in addition , the parameter is larger in the @xmath39 case than in the @xmath59 run ( at fixed time ) , demonstrating that the ( slowing ) effect of a larger percentage of bhs is stronger than the ( accelerating ) effect of a larger cluster concentration . in our @xmath53 simulations",
    "all bhs are ejected from the system at the end of the run , while three and one bhs are still present at the end of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 simulations , respectively ( see also @xcite for examples of models in which instead all or a large fraction of bhs are lost during the cluster evolution ) .",
    "the gradual loss of the initial population of bhs allows the bss to segregate and @xmath0 to grow and reach values above 0.4 - 0.5 with a rate that is slower for increasing fractions of bhs .",
    "the simulations presented here serve the purpose of illustrating the general effect of a population of black holes on the process of segregation of bss and the extent to which this effect depends on the fraction of bhs retained .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath0 might differ for clusters with different fractions of bhs .",
    "in particular , should the initial fraction of bhs be larger and/or the cluster structural properties allow to retain a larger fraction bhs than those adopted here ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , the rate of bss segregation ( and therefore the growth of @xmath0 ) could be slowed down and delayed more than what shown in the few illustrative cases we have explored .",
    "all these properties are consistent with the conclusions of our discussion about the segregation process in terms of evolution of the lagrangian radii ( see sect .",
    "[ lagr ] ) and show that the new parameter @xmath0 is a reliable indicator of the cluster dynamical evolution as traced by the bss population .",
    "[ fig_area_trh ] also shows that the time dependence of @xmath0 is characterized by two main regimes : an initial , slower phase , followed by a steeper trend toward the end of the simulations , at times approaching the cc time .",
    "this effect is more evident if bhs are included : the evolutionary times when the curves change regime are @xmath64 , 5.5 , 2 and @xmath65 in the @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath60 and @xmath59 runs , respectively",
    ". these epochs also correspond to the moment when the time dependence of the inner bss lagrangian radii also change slope , while those of the ref population evolve in a slower , smoother way ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_lag5 ] and [ fig_lag8 ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 shows a regime of faster time dependence when the cluster is approaching the cc phase further demonstrates that it is an indicator of the level of bss segregation and dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "figure [ fig_area_tcc ] shows the evolution of @xmath0 as a function of time normalized to the cc time of the bss and ref populations ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "interestingly , all the models fall on a relatively narrow band in this plane , irrespective of the amount and the mass of drs they contain .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0 might be used as an approximate indicator of how far a cluster is from cc of the visible component .",
    "we performed a set of direct n - body simulations of gcs with @xmath67 particles , with different initial concentrations ( @xmath36 and @xmath53 ) , and admitting a population of bsss and different fractions of nss and bhs ( including the case of systems with no heavy drs at all ) .",
    "bsss are modelled as single particles of @xmath68 .",
    "the simulations have been used to investigate how a population of heavy objects affects mass segregation and the dynamical evolution of a cluster , and what can be learned from bsss about these processes .",
    "we have shown that the segregation of bsss and of the most massive main sequence stars is significantly slowed down by the presence of bhs .",
    "this is due to the dynamical heating effect of these heavy objects that rapidly decouple from the other components , form a centrally concentrated sub - system and inhibit mass segregation of the less massive components .",
    "the effect of bhs stronger than that of concentration : in fact , in spite of a larger value of @xmath22 , the mass segregation process of currently visible stars ( with masses @xmath69 ) in the @xmath59 run is much slower than that of the @xmath39 simulation .",
    "because of their larger masses , bsss are expected to be more affected by the mass segregation process and to be more centrally segregated than the ref population .",
    "this has been indeed observed in several previous studies , also showing that the level of bss segregation ( and thus the relative separation between the bss and the ref cumulative radial distributions ) varies from cluster to cluster ( see , e.g. , figure 2 in @xcite ) . in the framework of the dynamical clock",
    "@xcite , this is the result of df , which favors the sedimentation of bsss toward the cluster center , causing the formation of a central peak in the normalized bss radial distribution .",
    "here we have proposed the parameter @xmath0 as a new tool to measure this sedimentation level .",
    "we found that @xmath0 shows a clear increasing trend with time that well reflects the evolution of the lagrangian radii observed in the various runs , with analogous dependences on the cluster concentration and the dr retention fraction .",
    "as the system evolves and loses part of the initial population of bhs , the level of bss segregation grows at an increasing rate and diverge from that of the ref stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the time dependence of @xmath0 shows a change in the slope .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath0 is indeed a very good tracer of bss segregation , and can reveal both how advanced bss segregation is and the extent to which the presence of a dr population has inhibited it . in all the considered simulations , the parameter assumes comparable values at any fixed fraction of the cc time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_area_tcc ] ) .",
    "hence , it seems to be a good indicator of the time remaining to the cc of the visible component , reasonably irrespective of the initial concentration and dr content of the system .    in order to illustrate how the strength of the mass segregation depends on the populations chosen , in fig .",
    "[ area_low ] we compare the time evolution of the @xmath0 parameter calculated for bsss and ref stars ( black curves , the same as those plotted in colors in fig . [ fig_area_trh ] ) and the time evolution of the @xmath0 parameter calculated using ref and @xmath70 particles ( grey curves ) . in the former case",
    "the mass ratio between the two populations is @xmath71 , while it is larger ( equal to 2 ) in the latter . while in both cases @xmath0 increases with time , the effect is much stronger in the former . this is because , in spite of a smaller mass ratio between the former populations ( bsss and refs ) , the relative effect of mass segregation on these components is stronger than that on ref and @xmath72 stars .",
    "this behaviour suggests that bsss are more powerful observational tracers of dynamical evolution than , for instance , main sequence stars .",
    "although our simulations are still idealized , they illustrate the general expected evolution of the @xmath0 parameter , and its dependence on the evolutionary stage of a cluster and its dr content . a larger exploration of the parameter space , including a wider grid of values for @xmath22 and @xmath73 , a population of primordial binaries and the effect of a host galaxy tidal field , is needed before drawing more quantitative conclusions .",
