    "supernovae ia observations in 1998 first hinted at the accelerated expansion rate of the universe @xcite . in a homogeneous and isotropic universe",
    "this accelerated expansion can be explained only by assuming a fluid with negative pressure .",
    "such a fluid is referred to as dark energy .",
    "ever since then there have been various candidates proposed for dark energy and also there have been various attempts to explain the accelerated expansion rate without invoking any dark energy component .",
    "the most popular and the simplest candidate for dark energy is cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "as the name suggests the energy density associated with cosmological constant does not evolve with time .",
    "one quantity which can play the role of cosmological constant is the vacuum because vacuum energy has the same equation of state as @xmath0 .",
    "but the problem with @xmath0 is that the value required to match with observation is smaller than its predicted value of vacuum energy from quantum field theory by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the origin of cosmological constant is still unknown . and also the observed value of energy density of cosmological constant is of the same order as that of matter .",
    "this is called coincidence problem .",
    "there are other models of dark energy too namely , quintessence and k - essence models . in these models",
    "the dark energy evolves with space and time .",
    "quintessence models solve the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "k - essence models have non - standard form of kinetic energy . in these models",
    "the universe is likely to go through big rip which means that the scale factor would become infinite some time in future and the large scale structures would be ripped apart and in some quintessence models there would come a time for freeze out which means the structures would collapse into each other .    working within the framework of einstein gravity dark energy",
    "is required only in homogeneous and isotropic universe . since the scale of homogeneity is still not well established , it is perhaps interesting to relax this assumption of homogeneity of space and see whether dark energy is still required to explain the cosmological observations",
    ".    many exact inhomogeneous solutions of einstein equations have been found .",
    "only lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) , szekeres and stephani models have been studied in the context of cosmology .",
    "ltb is spherically symmetric dust solution of einstein equations @xcite .",
    "szekeres is dust solution of einstein equations @xcite .",
    "stephani metric is solution of einstein equation when the energy density of the source has a pressure gradient @xcite . there have been many inhomogeneous models proposed which attempt to explain the cosmological observations without assuming any dark energy component @xcite .    while the existence of dark energy was first hinted by sn ia observations",
    ", there is a recent study which shows that for the generalized second law of thermodynamics to hold in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe a dark energy component or something equivalent in modified gravity models must exist @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite defined the gravitational entropy as sum of matter entropy and the entropy of the apparent horizon .",
    "apart from flrw models , these authors investigated various other cosmological models and found that chaplygin gas models @xcite , some holographic dark energy models @xcite , dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) brane model @xcite and cardessian model @xcite are allowed by generalized second law of thermodynamics .",
    "therefore the existence of dark energy is demanded not only by observations but also by thermodynamics .",
    "now it is interesting to see whether the inhomogeneous models which claim to explain the cosmological observations without dark energy satisfy the generalized second law of thermodynamics . for this",
    "we first need to define the gravitational entropy in inhomogeneous models . as a first step",
    "we follow the work of pavon and radicella by which we mean that we also define gravitational entropy as sum of the matter entropy and the entropy of the apparent horizon . but this definition may not be not universal because the apparent horizon may not exist in some inhomogeneous models while every gravitating system possibly has a gravitational entropy .",
    "therefore , we explore other candidates of gravitational entropy as well .",
    "we consider penrose s weyl curvature hypothesis which proposes the relation between the gravitational entropy and weyl tensor @xcite . following this hypothesis many different forms of entropy",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "and there have been various studies on the thermodynamics of various spacetimes @xcite .",
    "we choose few candidates of entropy and also a realistic inhomogeneous model . by realistic inhomogeneous model",
    "we mean that such an inhomogeneous model which provide a good fit to the data",
    ". then we investigate whether these candidates can represent gravitational entropy for the realistic inhomogeneous models .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : section [ sec1 ] briefly explains pavon and radicellas work related to thermodynamics of cosmological models . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we briefly recall ltb models .",
    "section [ sec3 ] describes the ltb void model for which we want to calculate the entropy . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we explain the apparent horizon and calculate the entropy of the ltb model .",
    "the results are shown in the same section . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "various other candidates of gravitational entropy are calculated in ltb model and the results are shown and interpreted .",
    "then we discuss the results in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "the generalized second law of thermodynamics [ gslt ] states that for a system to tend towards thermodynamic equilibrium its entropy should be ever increasing and its evolution should be of convex nature i.e. the entropy should satisfy the following two conditions : @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , where prime denotes an evolution parameter such as the scale factor or cosmological time .",
    "pavon and radicella [ pr ] have studied the thermodynamics of flrw and some modified gravity models and argued that dark energy ( or alternatively , modified gravity ) is indicated on thermodynamic grounds @xcite .",
    "below we briefly describe pr s work :    pr proceed to calculate @xmath4 and @xmath5 in flrw models as follows : the entropy of a flrw universe is sum of the entropy of the apparent horizon and the entropy of the fluids enclosed by the horizon .",
    "they chose the entropy of apparent horizon because the apparent horizon in flrw universes always exists ( which is not generally true for the particle horizon and the future event horizon ) and is assumed to possess an entropy proportional to its area @xcite and also a temperature @xcite .",
    "besides , it appears to be the appropriate thermodynamic boundary @xcite .",
    "further , they assume that the entropy of the apparent horizon is proportional to its area via the following equation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are planck length and boltzmann constant respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the surface area of the apparent horizon and can be calculated from @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 is the radius of the apparent horizon and @xmath13 the hubble factor of the flrw metric @xcite .",
    "using friedmann equations and the conservation equation it can be shown that @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the equation of state parameter @xmath17 .",
    "( [ primea1 ] ) shows that the area will increase in expanding universes if @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath19 constant eqn .",
    "( [ primea1 ] ) reduces to @xmath20 above equation shows that @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the flrw models with equation of parameter in this range are not favored by the convexity condition of gslt .",
    "the entropy of the fluid enclosed by the apparent horizon is calculated from following equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of dust particles contained within the apparent horizon .",
    "this equation calls for an explanation . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "since one is dealing with pressureless matter ( i.e. dust ) , the matter is cold , and has an effective temperature @xmath25 , which does not permit the definition of an entropy in a traditional manner .",
    "hence they propose associating one unit of entropy ( @xmath26 ) with each particle .",
    "we can also motivate this somewhat differently , by considering the fundamental relation @xmath27 at a constant temperature @xmath28 , and by noting that because the matter is non - relativistic [ dust ] , the pressure is extremely small , and the pressure term may be ignored . then by comparing the left and right hand side , and treating the temperature as a very small but non - zero quantity which cancels out , eqn .",
    "( 2.7 ) follows , being the same relation as proposed by @xcite . in homogeneous and isotropic universe @xmath24",
    "should have the following form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number density of dust particles .",
    "substituting the form of @xmath24 into the expression of matter entropy we obtain @xmath31 which shows that the matter entropy is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "hence @xmath33 is positive .",
    "it shows that @xmath34 in matter dominated flrw universe , which is not in accordance with the gslt .",
    "thus it has been shown by pr that in a pure matter flrw universe the total entropy which is the sum of matter entropy and the entropy of the apparent horizon does not satisfy the convexity condition . when a dark energy component is added to the flrw universe",
    "the entropy satisfies the generalized second law of thermodynamics",
    ". this dark energy can be the cosmological constant or a evolving dark energy i.e. quintessence or k - essence models .",

    "in ltb model there are three arbitrary functions out of which one is fixed by the coordinate choice since the equations so far are covariant under coordinate transformations .",
    "we are interested in studying the evolution of the entropy in a realistic ltb void model which is a good fit to observations .",

    "we will calculate the gravitational entropy in this model and see whether the entropy satisfies both the conditions of gslt . as a first step , following pr we also define entropy as sum of the entropy of the apparent horizon and the matter entropy . before calculating the entropy of apparent horizon",
    ", we briefly recall the definition of apparent horizon and its mathematical expression for ltb models .",
    "since we want to calculate the entropy of apparent horizon , it is necessary to first define what an apparent horizon is and what is the mathematical condition for it to exist in a ltb universe .",

    "2 .   since the area radius of the apparent horizon in ltb spacetime follows the condition given in eqn .",
    "( [ apparenthorizoncondition ] ) , the above two equations reduce to the following two equations at @xmath71 : @xmath72 3 .",
    "we then eliminate @xmath70 from eqns .",

    "[ s_mvst ] shows that the matter entropy increases almost linearly with time .",
    "this linear behavior was expected also .",

    "according to eqn .",
    "( [ apparenthorizoncondition ] ) this mass is proportional to the area radius radius of the apparent horizon which increases linearly with time .",
    "hence , the double derivative of the matter entropy will be very small compared to that of the entropy of the apparent horizon ( fig .",
    "[ s_mvst ] ) .",
    "the total entropy is the sum of the matter entropy and the entropy of the apparent horizon .",
    "since the apparent horizon entropy is of concave nature and double derivative of the matter entropy is very small , the sum of these two entropies will also be of concave nature .",
    "therefore , according to this definition of entropy this minimal void model does not satisfy the second condition of the generalized second law of thermodynamics .",
    "one could hence take the stance that the model is anti - thermodynamic or this definition is not a good representative of entropy in this minimal void model .",
    "another approach however would be to argue that inhomogeneous cosmological models which do not possess spatial symmetry may not have an apparent horizon at all .",
    "keeping such a situation in mind , one could advocate looking for a more generic measure of gravitational entropy , such as weyl curvature .",
    "we investigate this next .",
    "the weyl curvature hypothesis was proposed by penrose . the starting point for the weyl curvature hypothesis",
    "is the observation that the big bang singularity was very special .",
    "penrose argues that the universe must have been in a low entropy state initially in order for there now to be a second law of thermodynamics .",
    "assuming , as is commonly done , that the matter content of the universe was in thermal equilibrium near to the big bang , and therefore in a state of high entropy , one needs the contribution to the entropy from the rest of physics , which means the contribution from gravity or equivalently geometry , to be low .",
    "that is , the geometry must be highly ordered .",
    "penrose introduced the concept of gravitational entropy and proposed that it is related to weyl tensor .",
    "this hypothesis is called weyl curvature hypothesis . the reason for proposing that the gravitational entropy is related to weyl tensor because weyl tensor is zero in a homogeneous state and it is non - zero for a universe with inhomogeneous structures.therefore , if the gravitational entropy is related to weyl tensor , it would evolve from a low entropy state to high entropy state which would be in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .    following the proposal of this hypothesis many candidates of the gravitational entropy",

    "5 .   the product of canonical entropy by the square root of determinant of spatial metric .      1 .",
    "the entropy of the apparent horizon is positive and increases with time . but",

    "the integral of weyl scalar over amv volume is positive but decreases with time .",
    "it does not fulfill the first condition of gslt which requires the entropy to be ever increasing .",
    "hence , integrated weyl scalar does not represent gravitational entropy in amv model .",
    "3 .   the canonical definition of gravitational entropy varies with comoving distance as well as with time .",
    "therefore , we fix different values of @xmath37 and study its evolution .",
    "we find that it shows same behavior for four different values of @xmath37 in the large range 100 - 400 mpc at interval of 100 mpc .",

    "therefore , it can be a good representative of gravitational entropy in amv model .",

    "the integrated version of canonical definition of entropy is positive and is ever increasing also .",
    "however , the rate of increase is of concave nature .",
    "hence , this candidate is not in keeping with the second condition of gslt .",
    "even when added to matter entropy its evolution will not be of convex because the matter entropy increases linearly with time and hence its second derivative with respect to time is zero and therefore it will not alter the overall behavior of total entropy .",
    "the nature of only the gravitational entropy candidate will decide whether the total entropy is concave or convex .",
    "the last candidate which we studied is the product of canonical entropy and the square root of the determinant of spatial metric .",
    "this candidate also depends upon time as well as on the comoving distance @xmath37 .",
    "we fix four different values of @xmath37 in the range 100 - 400 mpc at interval of 100 mpc and study its evolution .",
    "we find that for all these values this candidate shows same behavior .",

    "it is positive and increases monotonically .",

    "<S> we examine a particular minimal void lemaitre - tolman -bondi inhomogeneous model which agrees well with observations . while on the one hand we find that the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is not well - behaved thermodynamically , on the other hand the canonical weyl curvature entropy shows satisfactory thermodynamic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that evolution of canonical weyl curvature entropy might be a useful way to evaluate the thermodynamic viability of inhomogeneous cosmologies . </S>"
