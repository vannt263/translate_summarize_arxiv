    "it is popularly believed among the recent time astrophysicists and the cosmologists that our universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "the strong supports of this idea of cosmic acceleration come from recent observational data of type ia supernovae ( riess , a. g. et al .",

    "2004 , 2005 ) and cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( spergel , d. n. et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) have provided main evidences .",
    "so there was a plenty of requirements for theories to be constructed which would be efficient enough to explain this interesting behavior .",
    "it was seemed that this way of explaination has taken two different paths namely introducing some modified gravity theory , such as @xmath0 gravity , where the extra terms in the modified friedmann equations are responsible for the acceleration .",
    "the second way was to introduce some non - baryonic matter ( known as dark energy ( de ) ) having negative pressure(violating the strong energy condition @xmath1 ) in the framework of general relativity . though still the nature and cosmological origin of the de have remained enigmatic at present , one recent proposal is the dynamical de scenario ( copeland , e. j. 2006 ) .",
    "the cosmological constant puzzles may be better interpreted by assuming that the vacuum energy is canceled to exactly zero by some unknown mechanism and introducing a de component with a dynamically variable equation of state . from some scalar field mechanism which suggests that the energy form with a negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving under a suitable potential the dynamical de paradigm",
    "is often realized .",

    "2003 ; bennett , c. et al . 2003 ; peiris , h. v. et al .",
    "2003 ) indicates that the two - thirds of the total energy of our universe is been occupied by the de where as dark matter occupies almost the rest .",
    "this de is thought to be responsible for the accelerated universe .",
    "many models have been constructed for interpreting this component .",

    "the de density of order @xmath3 , which appears to require the introduction of a new mass scale .",
    "the second difficulty , the cosmic coincidence problem , states : since the energy densities of de and dark mater scale so differently during the expansion of the universe , why are they nearly equal today ? to get this coincidence , it appears that their ratio must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the very early universe . recently",
    ", considerable interest has been stimulated in explaining the observed de by the holographic de(hde ) model .",
    "for an effective field theory in a box of size @xmath4 , with uv cut - off @xmath5 the entropy @xmath6 scales extensively , @xmath7 .",
    "however , the peculiar thermodynamics of black hole(bh ) ( bekenstein , j. d. 1973,1974,1981,1994 ; hawking , s. w. 1975,1976 ) has led bekenstein to postulate that the maximum entropy in a box of volume @xmath8 behaves nonextensively growing only as the area of the box , i.e . , there is a so called bekenstein entropy bound , @xmath9 .",
    "this nonextinsive scaling suggests that quantum field theory breaks down in large volume . to reconcile this breakdown with the success of local quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology , cohen et .",
    "al . ( 1999 ) proposed a more restrictive energy bound .",
    "they pointed out that in quantum field theory a short distance ( uv ) cut off is related to a long distance(ir)cut off due to the limit set by forming a black hole . in the other words , if the quantum zero point energy density @xmath10 is relevant to a uv cut - off , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath4 should not exceed the mass of a bh of the same size , thus we have @xmath11 , this means that the maximum entropy is in order of @xmath12 .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle ( hooft , g. t. 1993 ; susskind , l. 1994 ) is viewed as de , usually dubbed hde .",

    "although the choice of the ir cut off has raised on discussion in the literature ( li , m. 2004 ; pavon , d.et .",

    "@xmath18 is the scale factor of the background metric of the universe and h is the corresponding hubble parameter .",
    "the holographic energy density @xmath10 is then given by(taking @xmath19 ) @xmath20 furthermore , we can define the dimensionless dark energy as : @xmath21 in the case of a dark - energy dominated universe , dark energy evolves according to the conservation law @xmath22 or equivalently : @xmath23 where the equation of state is @xmath24 and consequently the index of the equation of state is of the form : @xmath25 as we can clearly see , @xmath26 depends on the parameter c. in recent observational studies , different groups have ascribed different values to c. a direct fit of the present available sne ia data indicates that the best fit result is the best - fit value @xmath27 within @xmath28 error range ( huang , q. g.et .",

    ", the compact objects , particularly the black holes ( bhs ) , are not visible but can be detected by the presence of the accretion disc around them . by analyzing light rays off an accretion disc",
    ", one can speculate the properties of the central compact object .",
    "although the accretion phenomena around compact objects ( particularly bhs ) have been extensively discussed over the last three decades ( e.g. mukhopadhyay , b. 2003 ) , it was started long ago in 1952 by bondi ( 1952 ) .",
    "he studied stationary spherical accretion problem by introducing formal fluid dynamical equations in the newtonian framework . in the framework of general relativity",
    ", the study of accretion was initiated by michel ( 1972 ) . by choosing the newtonian gravitational potential ,",
    "shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) formulated very simplistic but effective model of the accretion disc .",
    "some aspects of the accretion disc in fully relativistic framework had been studied by novikov and thorne ( 1973 ) and page and thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "subsequently , various aspects related to the critical behavior of general relativistic flows in spherical symmetry have been studied ( begelman , m. c. 1978 ; brinkmann , w. 1980 ; malec , e. 1999 ; das , t. k. 2001 ) .",
    "although there are a few steps forward , still it is extremely difficult to simulate the full scale realistic accretion discs including outflows in a full general relativistic framework .",
    "one may note that in bh accretion , an important issue is that the flow of accreting matter must be transonic in nature , i.e. , there should be sonic point(s ) ( chakrabarti , s. k. 1990 , 1996a , 1996b ) in the flow . on the other hand ,",
    "accretion flow around a neutron star is not necessarily transonic ( i.e. , sonic point may or may not exist ) .    due to present accelerated expansion of the universe , the matter in the universe is dominated by de ( almost @xmath34 of the matter is in the form of de ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume the accreting matter is in the form of de .",

    "section 3 contains the thermodynamical analysis .",

    "so , we have got the stress energy tensor components and the velocity components . now to determine different dynamical parameters we need to construct and solve different differential equations .",

    "the solution will be feasible if it passes through a critical point and it characterizes the fluid falling into the bh with monotonically increasing velocity .",

    "@xmath86 further due to fluid accretion the rate of change of bh mass ( huang , q. g. 2004b ) @xmath87 can be written as @xmath88 it is to be noted that the above equation is independent of the mass of the bh ( contrary to the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstr@xmath89 m bhs ( jamil , m. et .",

    "this radiation ( saskind , l. 1992 ) causes the evaporation of the bh which is balanced by the accretion of matter into the bh and as a result the total system is supposed to be under equilibrium .",
    "but when we analyze the parameters , for example temperature of the accreting fluid at very far from the bh with very near to the bh there will be a huge difference .",
    "but in local cells the parameters show equilibrium nature .",
    "such an equilibrium is called quasi equilibrium . in this paper",
    "we have considered large bhs in general .",
    "now if we think about small bhs then as the hawking temperature of the bh , @xmath91 is inversely proportional to its mass , temperature will increase for the small bhs .",
    "this will cause more radiation according to the standard fourth order rule of black body radiation . under such huge amount of hawking radiation",
    "the accretion - radiation equilibrium may not be the equilibrium one .",
    "in such a case we will not be able to speculate whether the accretion procedure is at all independent of the mass or not .",

    ". then the change of energy across the event horizon is given by ( chakraborty , s.et .",

    "to calculate that we will use ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) in ( [ 30 ] ) and with the help of ( [ 4 ] ) we have @xmath118 which on differentiation gives @xmath119 so , @xmath97 increases when @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the hubble radius , @xmath16 is the radius of the event horizon ( defined in ( [ 2 ] ) ) and @xmath97 decreases when @xmath122 .",

    "now it is quite awkward to hear that the bh is absorbing fluid but the mass of the bh is decreasing .",
    "obviously the negative pressure of the dark energy model is responsible for this incidence .",
    "we shall now examine the validity of the generalised second law of thermodynamics in the present case .",
    "using clausius relation , the time variation of horizon entropy is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the temperature of the event horizon .",
    "we now study the entropy variation of the matter in the form of hde bounded by the event horizon .",
    "we assume that the thermodynamical system bounded by the event horizon is an equilibrium one and hence the temperature of the matter inside the event horizon is same as @xmath128 . from the gibb s equation @xmath129",

    "( [ 34 ] ) ) we see that the term outside the square bracket in the right hand side is positive in phantom era .",
    "so to make the time variation of the total entropy to be positive the square bracket must be a positive quantity also and it is true again in the phantom era .",
    "so gslt is valid in the phantom era .",
    "but in quintessence era the term out side the square bracket is negative .",
    "so the square bracket must be negative to ensure the validity of the gslt , which lead us to a lower boundary for the equation of state parameter as @xmath132",
    "the work deals with the possibility of de accretion onto a general static spherically symmetric bh .",
    "the analysis shows that the evolution of mass of a static bh does not depend on its mass rather it depends on the equation of state of the hde . due to static non rotating bh",
    "the accreting de falls radially ( @xmath44 ) on the bh .",
    "although , the accreting hde satisfies gslt but the bh evaporates in phantom era while in quintessence era bh only accretes but the equation of state must have an lower bound for the validity of gslt .",
    "the figure shows the variation of @xmath97 against energy density @xmath10 and equation of state parameter @xmath66 .",
    "as expected we see that in phantom era whatever be the value of @xmath10 , @xmath97 is negative while in quintessence era @xmath97 is positive .",
    "further , the variation of the bh mass does not depend on any bh parameters , rather it depends on the horizons of the space time .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the geometry of the background space - time has a signified effect on the bh accretion of de.for further work it will be interesting to study the accretion of hde for rotating bh and examine the influence of rotation on the bh evaporation . + * acknowledgement :*    rb wants to thank west bengal state government for awarding jrf .",

    "<S> in this paper we deal with accretion of dark energy in the holographic dark energy model for a general non - rotating static spherically symmetric black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the black hole increases or decreases depending on the nature of the holographic dark energy ( quintessence or phantom ) as well as on some integration parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be illustrated that the enhancement or reduction of mass of a black hole is independent of the mass or size of the black hole itself . </S>",
    "<S> rather it depends only upon the radius of the event horizon of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the generalized second law of thermodynamics has been studied on the event horizon to be assured that the law holds even if when the black hole mass is decreasing though it is engrossing some mass . </S>",
    "<S> +   + key words : black hole accretion , phantom energy , thermodynamics . </S>"
