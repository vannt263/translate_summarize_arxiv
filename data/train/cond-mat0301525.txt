    "path integral methods@xcite are perhaps the most important techniques utilized to account for quantum contributions in equilibrium statistical simulations for many - body systems .",
    "they are based on the feynman - ka formula,@xcite which represents the density matrix and hence the partition function of a canonical quantum system as an infinite dimensional stochastic integral of a brownian bridge functional.@xcite this stochastic integral is then approximated by a sequence of finite dimensional integrals , which in turn are evaluated by monte carlo techniques .",
    "the two most important families of discretization techniques , while not unrelated , can be distinguished by the way the paths are parameterized . the discrete path integral ( dpi ) methods@xcite utilize the trotter product rule@xcite and appropriate short - time approximations to construct a more accurate finite - dimensional approximation of the quantum - mechanical density matrix .",
    "the random series implementations@xcite utilize the ito - nisio theorem@xcite to construct the brownian bridge in the feynman - ka formula .",
    "independent of which method is used , a major concern in the practical applications is the asymptotic rate of convergence as measured against the number of variables used to parameterize the paths @xmath2 as well as the computational time necessary to evaluate the various quantities involved .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the discrete methods is well studied@xcite and is known to be @xmath3 if the expressions of the short - time approximations are functionals of the potential only . in contrast , the relative merits of the random series techniques are poorly understood .",
    "there are two basic implementations of the random series techniques that are important for practical applications : the partial averaging@xcite and the reweighted methods.@xcite in this paper , we shall study the asymptotic rates of convergence of the partial averaging method for different classes of basis entering the ito - nisio theorem as well as for different classes of potentials .",
    "we obtain surprisingly powerful convergence theorems and , most of the time , we provide not only the convergence order of different methods , but also the convergence constants . in the remainder of the introduction",
    ", we try to convince the reader that such an analytical study is important both theoretically and practically .",
    "the partial averaging method has been rarely utilized in practical applications because it requires the gaussian transform of the potential for its implementation . for real life potentials ,",
    "this is a difficult but not impossible task .",
    "however , it was generally considered that the improvement the technique brings in does not warrant the effort of computing the gaussian transform of the potential and the so - called gradient corrected partial averaging method was used instead .",
    "it has been shown that this latter method has general @xmath3 asymptotic behavior for sufficiently smooth potentials and it has been argued that there is not much reason to suspect a better convergence rate for the full partial averaging method.@xcite however , more accurate numerical evidence recently presented in ref .",
    "( ) suggests that the full partial averaging method does have in fact a better behavior : if the technique is used in conjunction with the fourier path integral approach ( fpi)@xcite and if the potential is smooth enough , the asymptotic convergence is @xmath1 .",
    "consistent with these observations , in this paper we show that the asymptotic rate of convergence for the fpi partial averaging approximation ( pa - fpi ) is indeed @xmath1 whenever the potential has second order derivatives in a sense that will be made clear in the text . while we shall prove quite general convergence results valid for almost all series representations ,",
    "the pa - fpi approach , which is based on the wiener - fourier basis , will receive a special treatment .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the wiener - fourier series representation is the optimal representation as to the minimization of the number of variables used to parameterize the paths.@xcite    the importance of the partial averaging method resides also in the fact that it acts as a prototypical strategy for improving the asymptotic rate of convergence of the random series path integral methods . as",
    "such , the reweighted random series technique@xcite achieves superior asymptotic convergence by simulating the partial averaging approach . for this reason ,",
    "there is a close relation between the asymptotic rates of convergence of the two methods .",
    "while the asymptotic behavior of the reweighted method will be the object of a separate paper , we mention that such a study is greatly simplified once the convergence rates of the partial averaging method are known .",
    "the practical importance of the convergence theorems that will be established in the present paper consists in the fact that they give _ a priori _ knowledge about the asymptotic order of convergence based only on readily verifiable properties of the potential .",
    "these theorems also provide useful estimates of the absolute error in the evaluation of the density matrices and , by integration , of the partition functions . moreover ,",
    "if the potential has second order derivatives , the estimates for the density matrix are asymptotically exact and they can be used to derive the convergence constants for many other properties , as for instance the convergence constants for the h - method and t - method energy estimators.@xcite however , such applications require careful analytical work that is beyond the scope of the present paper .    the content of the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we give a short review of the partial averaging method with the purpose of establishing the notation .",
    "we also provide a description of the main classes of potentials for which the asymptotic convergence will be studied . in section  iii , we prove the main convergence theorems , which are valid for most series representations .",
    "we prove some asymptotic bounds for the density matrix in the case when the potential has first order sobolev derivatives and then we give the exact asymptotic behavior for the potentials having second order sobolev derivatives . in section",
    "iv we specialize the results of section  iii for the case of the wiener - fourier series representation .",
    "we prove that if the potential has first order sobolev derivatives , then the convergence is @xmath0 .",
    "then , we show that if the potential has second order sobolev derivatives , then the convergence is @xmath1 and we also provide the exact expression for the corresponding convergence constant . we illustrate the derived asymptotic convergence constants for the simple case of the harmonic oscillator and , in section  v , we summarize and discuss our results .",

    "for sure , the analysis must be restricted to those potentials for which the feynman - ka formula holds and for which the method does in fact converge .",
    "the feynman - ka formula  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is known to hold for a quite large class of potentials which is called the kato class . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been proven@xcite that the partial averaging method is convergent for all series representations and for all kato - class potentials that have finite gaussian transform .",
    "we provide below the mathematical definition of this class .",
    "the readers who find this definition meaningless might get a better insight about the nature of the potentials in this class by studying the examples we later provide .",

    "( ) , the reader may prove that the potentials of the form given by eq .",

    "such potentials include for instance the coulombic potentials as they appear in electronic structure calculations and for which @xmath100 .",
    "remark that the singularities in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15a ] ) can be oriented upward or downward .",
    "it does not make any difference as to the validity of the feynman - ka formula as well as the convergence of the partial averaging method .",
    "another important example of kato - class potentials are the functions @xmath8 that are continuous and bounded from below .",
    "it is trivial to verify that if @xmath101 and @xmath102 are some nonnegative numbers and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are kato - class potentials , then @xmath105 is also a kato - class potential . using this observation , one may argue that any ab initio potential obtained at the level of the born - oppenheimer approximation must be a kato - class potential .",
    "this is so because it can usually be written as a sum between a @xmath88 potential of the type given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:15a ] ) ( the internuclear repulsion term ) and a continuous and bounded from below potential ( this term arises from the electron - nuclear and electron - electron interactions ) .",
    "more generally , even for strongly ionic systems , one notices that the born - oppenheimer potential can have at most coulombic negative singularities and therefore it is of kato - class .",
    "many of the properties of the kato - class potentials were enumerated by aizenman and simon.@xcite as argued by them , the kato - class is the natural and in many aspects maximal class of potentials for which the feynman - ka formula holds .",
    "it is known for instance that any kato - class potential is locally integrable .",
    "that is , @xmath106 for all bounded domains @xmath107 .",
    "because of this restriction , the leonard - jones potential as well as some other empirical potentials are not included in the kato - class due to the @xmath108 singularity .",
    "even if the feynman - ka formula may be well defined for such potentials with positive non - integrable singularities , it is not clear if the computed answer is the green s function of the corresponding bloch equation .",
    "however , as far as the chemical physicist is concerned such issues are hardly of any relevance because the kato class comprises all potentials of physical interest .",
    "the leonard - jones potential can be brought into the kato - class by truncation or other approximations .",
    "the condition that the potentials have finite gaussian transform can be formulated as follows .",
    "for all vectors @xmath109 of strictly positive components , we consider the gaussian measure @xmath110 then , a potential is said to have finite gaussian transform if @xmath111 for all @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "let us notice that from the practical point of view , this additional condition is hardly a restriction .",
    "the potentials used in actual simulations are usually a sum between the born - oppenheimer interatomic potential and a _ constraining _ potential .",
    "the first one always has a finite gaussian transform .",
    "the second one is added in order to ensure that the partition function is finite @xmath114 and is intended to simulate , for example , the effect of the container in which a reaction takes place . for this purpose one",
    "usually uses a continuous and bounded from below potential , which is , of course , a kato - class potential .",
    "if , for instance , the potential increases to infinity slower than any exponential @xmath115 with @xmath116 , then it has a finite gaussian transform .",
    "but this is hardly a restriction since the typical constraining potentials are polynomials .    under these conditions",
    ", it was shown@xcite that the partial averaging sequence of approximations is convergent to the correct feynman - ka result ( which by itself is properly defined ) at least as far as the convergence of the density matrix and the partition function is concerned .",
    "however , we expect that the rate of convergence depends on the smoothness of the potential . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we are interested in establishing the class of potentials for which the fastest convergence is achieved . while the maximal class depends upon the specific series representation , we shall see that there is a sufficiently large class of potentials for which all series representations achieve their fastest asymptotic convergence .    theorem  3.b ) of ref .",
    "( ) says that in order to verify that a potential has a finite gaussian transform , it is enough to verify that @xmath117 for all @xmath113 and an arbitrarily given @xmath118 .",
