    "supernova ia ( snia ) observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite , contrary to friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models , with non - relativistic matter and radiation . also cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) data @xcite is suggesting that the expansion of our universe seems to be in an accelerated state which is referred to `` dark energy '' effect @xcite .",
    "cosmological constant , @xmath0 , as the vacuum energy can be responsible for this evolution by providing a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the observed value of @xmath0 is @xmath1 orders of magnitude smaller than the one computed from field theory models @xcite .",
    "quintessence is an alternative to consider a dynamical vacuum energy @xcite , involving one or two scalar fields , some with potentials justified from supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "however , the fine - tuning problem of these models which arises from cosmic coincidence issue has no satisfactory solution .",
    "the chaplygin gas model is an interesting proposal @xcite , describing a transition from a universe filled with dust - like matter to an accelerating expanding stage .",
    "this model was later generalized in ref .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas model is described by a perfect fluid obeying an exotic equation of state @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a positive constant and @xmath4 .",
    "the standard chaplygin gas @xcite corresponds to @xmath5 .",
    "some publications @xcite and reviews @xcite which studied the chaplygin gas cosmological models have already appeared in the literature .",
    "the chaplygin gas can be obtained from the string nambu - goto action in the light cone coordinate @xcite . since the application of string theory in principle is in very high energy",
    "when the quantum effects is important in early universe , a quantum cosmological study of the chaplygin gas is also well founded .",
    "recently , quantum mechanical description of a frw model with a generalized chaplygin gas has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to retrieve explicit mathematical expressions for the different quantum mechanical states and determine the transition probabilities towards an accelerated stage .",
    "moreover , quantization of frw model in the presence of chaplygin gas has been discussed in ref .",
    "there , we have considered matter as the chaplygin gas and discussed the early time behavior of expectation value of the scale factor through the application of schutz s formalism . in this paper , aside from the chaplygin gas which is coupled to gravity and has an advantage of furnishing a variable connected to matter which can be identified with time , we also include the perfect fluid in this scenario and investigate the analytical solutions in both early and late time universes .",
    "schutz s formalism @xcite gives dynamics to the matter degrees of freedom in interaction with the gravitational field .",
    "using proper canonical transformations , at least one conjugate momentum operator associated with matter appears linearly in the action integral .",
    "therefore , a schrdinger - like equation can be obtained with the matter variable playing the role of time .",
    "the application of schutz s formalism in stephani and frw perfect fluid cosmological models has been discussed in refs .",
    "note that our approach in principle is different from monerat _ et .",
    "@xcite , where they correspond the dynamical variable to the perfect fluid instead of chaplygin gas and resort to the numerical methods to obtain the time evolution of an initial wave packet .",
    "note that there is considerable evidence that the early universe is dominated by radiation .",
    "therefore , a natural setting for quantum cosmology is the one where radiation has the predominant role @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the chaplygin gas is dominated by the non - relativistic matter at early times ( see the following section ) .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with our knowledge of baby universe . according to @xcite",
    ", inflation can be accommodated within the generalized chaplygin gas scenario .",
    "hence , the way adopted to avoid this inconsistency is that the radiation dominated phase is followed by chaplygin dominated period so that we have the so - called chaplygin inflation @xcite .",
    "also , it would be more suitable to consider the field theory representation of the chaplygin gas @xcite to describe quantum cosmology . in this way",
    ", the chaplygin gas can be viewed as a modification of gravity as was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "also , the authors of @xcite have recently shown that the chaplygin gas model has a geometrical explanation within the context of brane world theory for any @xmath6 . consequently in these models the equation @xmath7^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a consequence of stress - energy conservation for a scalar field on the brane @xcite , or conservation of induced dark matter on the brane @xcite . here , @xmath8 is the scale - factor of the universe and @xmath9 is a positive integration constant .",
    "therefore , it is evocative to view the contribution of chaplygin gas to the stress - energy tensor as a brane induced modification of gravity . in this article , we used the fluid description for the chaplygin gas and for lagrangian formalism , the corresponding pressure .",
    "consequently , if we rely on the model described in @xcite , we will have covariance in our model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the quantum cosmological model with a chaplygin gas , as a portion of the matter content is constructed in schutz s formalism @xcite for early and late time universes .",
    "then the schrdinger - wheeler - dewitt ( swd ) equation in minisuperspace is obtained to quantize the model under the action of a perfect fluid effective potential .",
    "the wave function depends on the scale factor @xmath10 and on the canonical variable associated to the chaplygin gas , which in the schutz s variational formalism plays the role of time @xmath11 .",
    "we separate the wave function into two parts , one depends only on the scale factor and the other depends on the time .",
    "the time dependent part of the solution is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we construct wave packets from the eigenfunctions and compute the time - dependent expectation values of the scale factor to investigate the existence of singularities at quantum level .",
    "moreover , we present some analytical solutions in both early and late time epoches . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "the action for gravity plus chaplygin gas in schutz s formalism is written as @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath16 is the induced metric over the three - dimensional spatial hypersurface , which is the boundary @xmath17 of the four dimensional manifold @xmath18 .",
    "we choose units such that the factor @xmath19 becomes equal to one .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 denote chaplygin gas and perfect fluid pressure , respectively .",
    "note that , according to @xcite the above action is equivalent to the usual hawking - ellis formalism for perfect fluid description @xcite .",
    "perfect fluid satisfies the barotropic equation of state @xmath22 the first two terms were first obtained in @xcite and the last term of ( [ action ] ) represents the matter contribution to the total action . in schutz s formalism",
    "@xcite the fluid s four - velocity can be expressed in terms of five potentials @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the specific enthalpy .",
    "@xmath27 is the specific entropy , and the potentials @xmath24 and @xmath25 are connected with rotation which are absent of models in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type .",
    "the variables @xmath23 and @xmath26 have no clear physical meaning .",
    "the four - velocity also satisfies the normalization condition @xmath30 the frw metric @xmath31 can be inserted in the action ( [ action ] ) , where @xmath32 is the lapse function and @xmath33 is the metric on the constant - curvature spatial section . following the thermodynamic description of ref .",

    "however , an analytical quantum mechanical treatment of this frw minisuperspace with the above hamiltonian does not seem feasible .",
    "therefore , it requires some approximation .",
    "we study the chaplygin gas expression in early and late times limits , namely for small scale factors @xmath43 @xcite and large scale factors @xmath44 , separately .",
