    "the global anomalies matching conditions and constrains are discussed in @xcite .",
    "an interesting property of the @xmath1 state is that the three color gauge group breaks spontaneously to a left over @xmath2 subgroup and it can play a role for the physics of compact objects @xcite . in reference @xcite it has been shown that the confining scale of the unbroken @xmath2 color subgroup is lighter than the superconductive gap @xmath3 .",
    "the confined degrees of freedom , glueball - like particles , are expected to be light with respect to @xmath3 , and the effective theory based on the anomalous variation of the dilation current has been constructed in @xcite .    clearly for the physics of compact objects and more generally for a complete understanding of the qcd phase diagram it is relevant to know at what temperature the @xmath2 color gauge group confines / deconfines , the order of the phase transition and the equation of state .",
    "investigating the deconfinement phase transition is , in general , a complex problem . at zero density importance sampling lattice simulations",
    "are able to provide vital information about the nature of the temperature driven phase transition for 2 and 3 colors yang - mills theories with and without matter fields ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "different models are used in literature to tackle / study the features of this phase transition from a theoretical stand point .",
    "some models compute non zero temperature corrections for the glueball lagrangian with or without elementary gluon degrees of freedom ( the latter added to describe the deconfined side of the phase transition ) .",
    "others rely on mean field theories encoding the symmetries of the polyakov loops @xcite .",
    "hence we consider a simple , but predictive , model for the deconfinement temperature which makes use of the glueball lagrangian valid at non zero quark density @xcite .",
    "we investigate the one loop thermal effective potential corrections for the dilatonic lagrangian and observe that as we increase the temperature a new local minimum sets in for a lower value of the gluon condensate with respect to the zero temperature one .",
    "the critical temperature is defined as the value for which the two local minima have the same free energy value . above this critical temperature",
    "the model is no longer applicable since new degrees of freedom like the unconfined gluons are expected to appear ( see e.g. @xcite ) and we will briefly comment on their effects",
    ". an amusing feature of the model is that the critical temperature can be determined analytically .",
    "this is so since the new minimum appears for a zero vacuum expectation value of the gluon condensate and at this point , in the one loop approximation , one can exactly compute the effective thermal potential yielding the following estimate for the critical temperature : @xmath4{\\frac{90\\,v^3}{2e\\pi^2}}\\hat{\\lambda } \\ . \\label{approxtc}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the euler number , @xmath6 is the confining scale of the @xmath2 gluon - dynamics in 2sc and @xmath7 is the gluon @xcite as well as light glueball velocity @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ approxtc ] ) is a good approximation also for the in vacuum theory . here",
    "when eq .",
    "( [ approxtc ] ) is adjusted to take into account the gluonic degrees of freedom the higher order ( in loop ) contributions are shown to be less than 10% ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the deconfining / confining critical temperature is smaller than the critical temperature @xmath8 for the superconductive state itself which is estimated to be @xmath9 with @xmath3 the 2sc gap @xcite .",
    "actually the breaking of lorentz invariance , due to the quark chemical potential and encoded in the glueball velocity , further reduces the critical temperature by a factor @xmath10 relative to the in vacuum case .",
    "this is a general feature independent of the model lagrangian , also observed in @xcite .",
    "the temperatures in play are much less than the value of the quark chemical potential .",
    "the situation is more involved if also rotational invariance breaks spontaneously due , for example , to the appearance of a spin one condensate @xcite .",
    "we study the glueball mass as function of temperature , chemical potential and @xmath3 . in the confined phase the mass is , at a very good approximation , constant with respect to the temperature .    by computing the glueball thermal effective potential we provide part of the equation of state for the 2sc phase at low temperatures . in particular we can compute the pressure , the energy density and the entropy of the system below the critical deconfining temperature .",
    "it is important to stress that in this paper we are considering an ideal 2sc state where the up and down quarks are massless and the strange quark is infinitely massive .",
    "when computing properties related to the physics of compact stars it is very important to introduce in the model the effects of the quark masses as well as the ones induced by a not too heavy strange quark .",
    "these effects may affect the @xmath2 gluon properties and can be investigated using for example the effective theories near the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "it would also be very interesting to see how the non perturbative @xmath2 dynamics might affect the recent results in @xcite .",

    "since the gluon - condensate is not a true order parameter for the deconfining transition the glueball lagrangian can not be used to infer the order of the transition itself . to settle this issue",
    "we modify the polyakov s loop inspired model @xcite to fit the present case and finally predict a second order phase transition .",
    "finally we suggest how ordinary lattice importance sampling techniques can be used to check our results and constitute , at the same time , the first simulations testing the high quark chemical potential but small temperature region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the glueball lagrangian , if extended to describe the transition point , predicts a first order transition which seems to disagree with the prediction based on the order parameter ( polyakov s loop ) .",
    "actually the disagreement is an apparent one . indeed",
    "only the order parameter is obliged to know about the order of the phase transition .",
    "any other gauge invariant quantity does not need to display the same behavior while still bearing information about the phase transition itself ( see for example @xcite page 3 equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) and subsequent discussion ( first reference ) ) . in practice",
    "the critical temperature predicted represents also the limit of applicability of our simple model . at the critical point",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory for the order parameter is the proper way to describe the transition itself and can be used to infer the order of the phase transition .",
    "unfortunately though the ginzburg - landau theory can not predict the critical temperature . the previous discussion does not imply that the glueball and the order parameter ( the polyakov loop ) at the transition are not related @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that in general we have a tower of scalar , pseudoscalar and other excited glueball states in the confined regime together with the other physical states involving quarks of the 2sc state .",
    "we have made the standard assumption that the low energy @xmath2 dynamics is dominated by the associated lightest mode in the theory : the scalar glueball .",
    "this state does not couple to the light ungapped up and down quarks in the direction 3 of color ( for a review of the complete low energy effective theory of the 2sc state see the 7th reference in @xcite ) .",
    "besides , according to @xcite , the quark temperature effects are exponentially suppressed ( @xmath11 ) so for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for an initial investigation , we can neglect these corrections . for temperatures in the range @xmath14 the gapped quark dynamics",
    "is no longer negligible and some of their effects have been computed using transport theory in @xcite .",
    "our model must be considered only as a first step toward a more complete theory of the 2sc state where the @xmath2 non perturbative dynamics is included .    in section [ glueball ]",
    "we provide the light glueball lagrangian and construct the one loop thermal effective action . here",
    "we suggest a way to relate the results obtained by employing different parameterizations for the glueball field . in section",
    "[ features ] we study the relevant features connected with the deconfining transition .",
    "we provide an economical criterion to estimate the critical temperature similar to the one extensively used in literature for the in vacuum yang - mills theories @xcite . finally using the polyakov loop model adapted to the present case",

    "it is also important to stress that the glueballs move with the same velocity as the underlying gluons in the 2sc color superconductor @xcite .",

    "our model applies directly only to the ideal 2sc state and for physical applications we need to consider in some detail the corrections induced for example by the quark masses .",

    "the break down point signals the presence of new lighter degrees of freedom which needed to be taken into account . in the absence of quarks a reasonable order parameter for the @xmath115 yang - mills theory is the polyakov loop @xcite : @xmath116\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 denotes path ordering , @xmath118 is the @xmath115 coupling constant and @xmath119 is the coordinate for the three spatial dimensions while @xmath120 is euclidean time .",
    "the @xmath121 field is real for @xmath122 while otherwise complex .",
    "this object is charged with respect to the center @xmath123 of the @xmath115 gauge group @xcite under which it transforms as @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "a relevant feature of the polyakov loop is that its expectation vanishes in the low temperature regime and is non zero in the high temperature phase .",
    "this behavior has recently lead pisarski @xcite to model the yang - mills ( non supersymmetric ) phase transition as a mean field theory of polyakov loops .",
    "one can simply show that for @xmath2 one expects a second order phase transition ( as function of the temperature ) and a weak first order for @xmath24 .",
    "we can use pisarski s model to predict the order of the transition in the present case . assuming that a local @xmath2 yang - mills action at low energies does exists we construct the simplest polykov loop using the rescaled space time coordinates and fields : @xmath126\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath127 and @xmath128 the @xmath2 pauli matrices , and the connection with the underlying fields is @xmath129 while @xmath130 . the rescaled euclidean time @xmath131 leads to @xmath132 while @xmath19 is a possible magnetic permeability which turns to be equal to one in our case . at this point",
    "the effective mean field type of model a l pisarski for @xmath133 is similar to the one for the in vacuum @xmath2 yang - mills theory .",
    "so if we make the strong but plausible assumption ( as shown above ) that all the way up and above the deconfinement @xmath2 color phase transition the effects of the quark superconductive matter can be taken into account just via a non zero dielectric constant we expect a second order phase transition for the @xmath2 of color in 2sc . it is relevant to mention that the order of the transition might change if we include new contributions arising for example by considering the quark masses .",
    "the deconfining temperature is expected to be the one close to our prediction obtained from the glueball model lagrangian . even if a non zero magnetic permeability exists the present argument",
    "would not be modified .",
    "@xmath2 yang - mills with non zero dielectric and magnetic permeability can be simulated , using standard sampling methods , on the lattice .",
    "for a large body of work on @xmath2yang  mills theory we refer to @xcite .",
    "these results would test at the same time the validity of the glueball model for the prediction of the critical temperature and the order of the phase transition according to the polyakov loop model in a framework slightly modified with respect to the in vacuum case . besides the latter would also constitute the first lattice simulations testing the high quark chemical potential but small temperature region of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the disagreement between the first order phase transition predicted by the glueball lagrangian and the previous argument based on the symmetries obeyed by the order parameter is an apparent one .",
    "in fact any gauge invariant quantity which is not an order parameter does not need to behave as the order parameter itself at the transition @xcite as discussed at length in the introduction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we studied the temperature effects on the unbroken @xmath2 color gauge interactions for the 2 flavor case at high matter density . using a simple model based on a light glueball lagrangian we estimated the @xmath2 deconfinement critical temperature for given chemical potential and superconductive gap value .",
    "we have shown that the deconfining / confining critical temperature is smaller than the critical temperature for the superconductive state itself .",
    "the breaking of lorentz invariance ( already at zero temperature ) , encoded in the glueball velocity , further reduces the critical temperature by a factor @xmath10 relative to the in vacuum case . by computing the glueball thermal effective potential",
    "we have the equation of state for part of the ideal 2sc phase ( i.e. zero up and down quark masses and infinitely massive strange quark ) .",
    "in particular we can compute the pressure , the energy density and the entropy of the system .",
    "another relevant point is that we have developed a general framework according to which any parameterization of the glueball field can be used to construct the full thermal effective action arising from the lagrangian constructed using the anomalous variation of dilation current .      in order to apply our model to the physics of compact objects we should extend it in order to take into accounts the effects of the the up and down quark masses as well as the effects of a not too massive strange quark .",
    "about two months after we submitted this paper the paper @xcite appeared where it is claimed that the 2sc state might not be present on compact stars .",
    "this is a very dynamical issue which deserves further studies .",
    "the present paper deals with the properties of part of the ideal 2sc state and as such our results are not affected by this claim .",
    "however possible astrophysical applications may be affected .",
    "finally also ref .",
    "@xcite which clarifies the relation between the order parameter and the gluon condensate further strengthening our approach appeared after this paper was submitted .    it is a pleasure for us to thank r. casalbuoni for suggesting this problem to us .",
