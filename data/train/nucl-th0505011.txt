    "in nuclei close to the drip lines the low - lying excited states belong mostly to the continuum part of the spectrum . it is therefore not surprising that a lot of effort has been devoted recently to the treatment of the continuum in nuclear models .",
    "one of the first attemps to evaluate continuum configurations in nuclei was done within the continuum shell - model ( see ref.@xcite and the references therein ) . in this shell model approach the coupling to the single - particle continuum",
    "is introduced through the scattering states of real energies .",
    "a different approach for evaluating the continuum processes in the shell - model framework is based on berggren representation . in this representation",
    "the single - particle continuum is formed by a finite number of gamow resonances and a continous set of scattering states of complex energy .",
    "the advantage of a shell model based on berggren representation is that it allows a direct calculation of multi - particle resonant states in nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "the continuum part of the excitation spectrum was also investigated using mean field techniques .",
    "one of the most known of these approaches is the continuum - rpa @xcite . in this approach , well suited for the description of particle - hole ( @xmath2 ) excitations in closed shell nuclei , the contribution of the continuum to the @xmath2 response function is calculated exactly . to single out from the continuum @xmath2 response the states corresponding to the @xmath2 resonances ,",
    "a resonant - rpa approach was also developed @xcite , in which the coupling to the single - particle continuum is introduced through a finite set of gamow functions .",
    "for even - even nuclei with open shells , where pairing correlations are important , the continuum part of the spectrum corresponds to two - quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the unbound two - quasiparticle excitations can be described in the continuum - qrpa approach @xcite .",
    "self - consistent continuum - qrpa calculations are presently done only with zero - range forces @xcite . at variance with the continuum - rpa , in these calculations",
    "the continuum contribution is taken into account only up to an energy cut - off .    in odd - even nuclei",
    "the most simple excitations are of the one quasiparticle type .",
    "the continuum part of the one quasiparticle spectrum can be calculated by solving the hfb equations with scattering type boundary conditions @xcite . by using the behaviour of the phase shift close to a resonance",
    ", one can find the quasiparticle resonances of physical interest .",
    "the quasiparticle resonances can be found also by solving the hfb equations in complex energy plane , as have been already done for some particular hamiltonians @xcite .    however , the simplest framework to evaluate one quasiparticle resonances is the bcs approach .",
    "the contribution of resonant states to pairing correlations can be introduced in the bcs equations through the scattering states with energies located in the vicinity of single - particle resonance energies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the resonant continuum was studied by solving the bcs equations in a basis containing only bound and gamow states @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this study is that the global quantities associated to the bound state of a nucleus ( e.g. , binding energy , radii ) become complex .",
    "the scope of this paper is to show how one can calculate within the bcs approach the energies and the widths of quasiparticle resonances by taking into account the whole contribution of single - particle continuum to pairing correlations and , in the same time , by preserving the correct properties of physical observables .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum is described here within the berggren representation . since",
    "this representation is not very common in nuclear structure calculations , we will first describe it briefly , emphasizing those features that we will need in the present paper . for more details",
    "@xcite .",
    "the berggren representation is formed by bound states , gamow resonances , and a continuous set of scattering states of complex energy . for a given mean field potential ( e.g. , of woods - saxon type ) , the gamow states are the outgoing solutions of the schrodinger equation and correspond to a discrete set of complex wave numbers @xmath3 . to each gamow state @xmath4 with the wave number @xmath3 is associated a `` mirror '' state @xmath5 with the wave number @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 .",
    "the gamow states and their mirrors form a biorthogonal set which can be normalized to unity by using various regularization schemes @xcite .",
    "all the wave functions written above are the radial single - particle wave functions of angular momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the scattering states introduced in the berggren representation belongs to a contour in the complex momentum or complex energy plane .",
    "an example of such a contour in the complex energy plane is shown in figure [ fig : cont ] .",
    "are the vertices defining the contour .",
    "the open circles labelled by @xmath9 indicate the complex energy of the gamow resonances enclosed by the contour while the open squares label by @xmath10 are the bound states .",
    "the dot is a pole of the s - matrix excluded from the berggren expansion[fig : cont],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .",
    "the contour encloses the poles associated to the gamow states which are taken explicitely into the berggren representation .",
    "the scattering states belonging to the contour , @xmath11 , the enclosed gamow resonances , @xmath4 , and the bound states , @xmath12 , form a complete set , i.e. , @xmath13 in numerical applications the integral along the path @xmath14 is evaluated by using a finite number of scattering states of energy @xmath15 defined by a chosen quadrature rule . in what follows this set of scattering wave functions together with the bound and gamow states are denoted by a unique function , i.e. ,    @xmath16    where the quantities @xmath17 depends on the quadrature . in general",
    ", they are defined by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the quadrature weights and @xmath20 are the derivative of the complex contour with respect to the parametrisation variable .    in principle , a berggren representation can be formed by using any set of gamow states enclosed by a contour in the complex plane . however , from physical point of view it is better to choose a basis which includes explicitely only narrow gamow resonances .",
    "the contribution of wide resonances which are not included explicitetly in the berggren representation is automatically taken into account through the scattering states belonging to the contour .",
    "the bcs equations in berggren basis will be derived here from the hartree - fock - bogolibov ( hfb ) equations in coordinate representation . for zero range forces and for spherically symmetric systems the radial hfb equations have the following form @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the chemical potential , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mean field hamiltonian and pairing field , respectively . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the up and down components of the hfb wave function , denoted below by @xmath27 ) . at large distances @xmath25",
    "decays exponentially for @xmath28 and behaves as a scattering state for @xmath29 . on the other hand",
    ", the function @xmath26 goes to zero exponentially for any value of the quasiparticle energy ( for a general discussion on the asymtotic properties of the hfb wave functions see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the quasiparticle spectrum is discrete for @xmath28 and continous for @xmath30 . in the ground state of the system the particle density and the pairing density are given by :    @xmath31    @xmath32    the summations in this equation is over the quasiparticle spectrum of the system ( for @xmath30 the sum should be replaced by an integral ) up to a given cut - off energy .    in the calculations presented in the next section we take for the mean field a wood - saxon potential .",
    "the pairing field is calculated self - consistently by using a pairing interaction of the following form @xcite :    @xmath33 \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r^\\prime } ) \\equiv v_{eff } \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r^\\prime}).\\ ] ]    with this pairing interaction the pairing field is given by : @xmath34    before going further with the derivation , it is worth mentioning how the particle and pairing densities behave in excited states belonging to the continuum part of the quasiparticle sectrum of odd - even nuclei .",
    "formally , in order to get the excited state coresponding to a state @xmath35 of an odd - even nucleus one can simply interchange the eigenvector @xmath36 by @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the particle density corresponding to an excited state @xmath35 will depend on @xmath38 .",
    "thus , if the excitated state belongs to the continuum , the function @xmath39 is of a scattering type ; hence , there is a finite probability for the particle to be found at infinity , as physically required . on the other hand , by interchanging @xmath39 and @xmath40 one does not affect the asymtotic behaviour of pairing density , which is still going to zero exponentially at very large distances .",
    "this is again a physically meaningful condition since when a particle is very far from the nucleus , its contribution to the pairing correlations should vanish .",
    "starting from the hfb equations in coordinate space we can easily get the hfb equations in berggren representation . in order to accomplish that",
    ", we first expand the hfb wave functions in the berggren basis :    @xmath41    @xmath42    where the expansion coeficients , related to the bogoliubov transformation , are complex quantities .",
    "then one multiplies the hfb equations from the left with the complex conjugate of a mirror berggren vector , @xmath43 and one performs the radial integration .",
    "one thus gets the hfb equations in berggren representation :    @xmath44    which formally have the same structure as in any hermitic representation .",
    "the essential difference is that the matrix elements of the pairing field are defined with the berggren metric , i.e. , by using mirror states in the bra positions and employing regularisation techniques for calculating the diverging integrals .",
    "thus , @xmath45 is defined by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mirror state corresponding to @xmath48 .    finally , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hfbm ] ) one can get the bcs equations in the berggren representation by neglecting the off - diagonal matrix elements of the pairing gap matrix .",
    "physically , this approximation means that one neglects the pairing correlations associated to the cooper pairs formed in states which are not time - reversed . in this approximation",
    "the expansions ( 7,8 ) of the hfb wave function are reduced to one term .",
    "the corresponding expansion coeficients , denoted below by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , are complex quantities .",
    "they satisfy the condition @xmath51 , which is obtained from the berggren normalization condition of the hfb wave function @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 . by combining this condition with eq.([eq : hfbm ] ) one gets the bcs equations in the berggren representation :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and the chemical potential is found from the particle number equation : @xmath56 r^2 dr~~.\\ ] ]    in conclusion , apart from the radial integrals which are calculated with the berggren metric ( and a given regularisation procedure ) , the bcs equations in the berggren representation have formally the same expression as in any hermitic and discrete basis .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the pairing gaps and the occupation probabilities associated to the scattering states correspond to an energy interval .",
    "the advantage of working in berggren representation is that the quasiparticle resonances appear as unique states , associated to the gamow functions . in this way",
    "the widths of the quasiparticle resonances , given by the imaginary parts of the quasiparticle energies , are calculated unambiguously .    in principle",
    ", one can get the complex energies associated with the resonant states by solving the bcs equations in complex energy plane . however , due to the strong non - linearity of the bcs equations , this is a difficult numerical task .",
    "one can avoid this task by using the fact that the pairing field and the chemical potential do not depend on the representation .",
    "thus , they can be calculated by solving the bcs equations in a real energy representation , which can be obtained by choosing the @xmath14 contour to be the real energy axis . from the pairing field",
    "calculated using the real energy axis , we can then get , by using eq.(11c ) , the pairing gaps associated to the gamow states . with these values of the pairing gaps , which are complex quantities , one can finally calculate , by using eq.(11b ) , the energies of the resonant quasiparticle states .",
    "the scope of the calculations presented below is twofold : a ) to illustrate , within the approximation discussed above , how the energies and the widths of quasiparticle resonant states behaves in neutron - rich nuclei ; b ) to analyse what is the relative contribution of resonant and non - resonant continuum upon pairing correlations in nuclei close to the dripline . for these purposes",
    "we have performed calculations for the isotopes @xmath0o and @xmath1ni .",
    "the bcs calculations presented in this section are based on a mean field of woods - saxon form .",
    "in addition to the mean field , we take also a standard spin - orbit interaction , with the form factor given by the derivative of a wood - saxon function .",
    "the wood - saxon parameters we used for oxygen isotopes have the following values : @xmath57=55.8 mev , @xmath58=12.12 mev , @xmath59=1.21 fm and @xmath60 = 0.65 fm .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the same for the mean field and for the spin - orbit interaction . with these parameters",
    "we get for the isotope @xmath61o the single - particle energies shown in table [ sps ] .",
    ".[sps ] single- particle energies ( in mev ) corresponding to @xmath61o and @xmath62ni [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have discussed how the energies and the widths of quasiparticle resonances can be calculated by using the bcs equations written in berggren representation . in this representation",
    "the pairing gaps associated to the quasiparticle resonances , @xmath63 , are obtained by integrating the pairing field with the square of gamow states . on the other hand , the pairing field , which does not depend on representation ,",
    "is calculated by solving the bcs equations in a single - particle basis formed from bound states and scattering states of real energies .",
    "then , the energies associated to the quasiparticle resonances @xmath64 are calculated by using the standard bcs formula , i.e . , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are the energies of the gamow states .",
    "since both @xmath66 and @xmath63 are complex quantities , the quasiparticle energies are also complex . as in the case of single - particle resonances ,",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath64 are associated to the widths of the quasiparticle resonances .",
    "the calculation of quasiparticle resonances was illustrated for the case of the isotopes @xmath0o and @xmath1ni .",
    "it was shown that in these isotopes the contribution of the single - particle resonant states upon pairing correlations is dominant compared to the contribution of background continuum .",
    "the most relevant aspect of the bcs calculations presented here is that they describe the excitations in resonant quasiparticle states in term of individual states , as in the case of bound states excitations .",
