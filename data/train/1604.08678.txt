    "usually , traveling wave resonators , such as whispering - gallery ( wg ) microcavities @xcite , hold the mirror reflection geometry symmetry and support clockwise ( cw ) and counter clockwise ( ccw ) traveling wave modes simultaneously .",
    "because of time - reverse symmetry of light , cw and ccw modes degenerate in non - gyromagnetic materials .",
    "when there is external perturbation to the cavity boundary , the cw and ccw modes will couple to each other and form a pair of standing wave modes , which are odd and even symmetric superpositions of cw and ccw waves with equal weights @xcite . in consequence , transmission of a passive cavity or the emission of an active cavity",
    "are symmetric in both directions .",
    "although this feature has no harm for most applications like narrow - band filters , optical resonators with chiral symmetry breaking are of great interest in both physics and many applications including unidirectional lasers @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to break the chiral symmetry of a microcavity system .",
    "one category of approaches addresses the issue by deforming a micro - cavity to break the chiral symmetry in terms of geometry .",
    "people can create deformed microcavities with a chiral boundary shape , such as a spiral micro - cavity @xcite and an asymmetric limacon micro - cavity @xcite , to realize unidirectional emission of light .",
    "a circular cavity can also be tuned to a chiral one with multiple scatterers on the rim @xcite , which will benefit microcavity - based nanoparticle sensing . in another category , a rotation @xcite or a time dependent modulation @xcite along angular direction of a microcavity introduces an effective angular momentum , breaking the time reversal symmetry of light in the wg microcavity .",
    "furthermore , both the geometry and time symmetry are broken by rotating a limacon cavity @xcite , which provides a sensitive on - chip rotation detector by monitoring far - field emission patterns .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative approach to break the chiral symmetry in a micro - ring cavity , based on the engineered dissipation @xcite of optical modes . by balancing the direct reactive coupling and indirect dissipative coupling with proper phase difference ,",
    "the cavity eigenmodes become pure cw or ccw , which are the chiral modes in a micro - ring .",
    "to verify the theory , we introduce dielectric perturbations to a normal micro - ring , that is , adding pure real or imaginary dielectric constant onto original one .",
    "the numerical simulation based on the maxwell equations confirms the prediction of our analytical model .",
    "the chiral eigenmodes and an asymmetric transmission spectra in forward and backward directions are shown in the micro - ring system .",
    "we believe this simple and dissipative - related asymmetry micro - ring can be used as a laser resonator with unidirectional emission and as a key element of a highly sensitive sensor @xcite .     and @xmath0 couple to a common lossy channel @xmath1 ( left penal ) .",
    "it can be reduced to a effective model in which @xmath2 and @xmath0 dissipatively coupled with each other ( right penal ) .",
    "( b ) a micro - ring with dielectric and absorptive materials depositing or doping on each rims works as a pure chiral resonator .",
    "( c ) a phase matching diagram for modes with mode index @xmath3.,width=302 ]",
    "before a detailed study on the wg modes , we briefly discuss a general model of reactive and dissipative interactions between bosonic modes .",
    "suppose there are two ordinary mutual coupled modes @xmath2 and @xmath0 coupling with a lossy mode @xmath1 , then the coupled mode equations described the three mode system are ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch](a ) left penal ) @xmath4 here , the system evolves along the general axis @xmath5 , which can be time , space or other generalized coordinates . in the parameter @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "are intrinsic oscillation frequencies and rates of dissipation to independent channels , respectively .",
    "they vary with coordinate @xmath5 for mode @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the common reactive couplings between modes a , b , and c , which implies the coupling inducing a coherent energy transfer between the modes . if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are satisfied , i.e. relaxation rate of the mode @xmath1 is ultra - fast and the mode @xmath1 is approximately at the static state @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 and we arrive at the effective coupling modes equations ( fig .",
    "[ sketch](a ) right penal ) @xmath17 as expected , the introduced lossy channel to modes @xmath2 and @xmath0 induces additional dissipations @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "however , it is not intuitive that there is an additional term @xmath20 for the coupling between the two modes , due to the coherent interference in the shared lossy channel .",
    "the additional coupling term is a real number , which indicates that it is a dissipative coupling instead of a reactive coupling .",
    "if the the coupling to bath ( @xmath21 ) and the internal coupling ( @xmath10 ) are modulated along @xmath5 , the effective coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath0 can be rewrote as complex function of @xmath5 @xmath22 the nontrivial phase accumulation @xmath23 will lead to interesting effects , which are absent in a system of pure reactive or dissipative coupling . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a specially engineered dissipation in which @xmath24 is a linear equation of @xmath5 . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective coupling @xmath25 includes a generalized momentum @xmath26 , which breaks @xmath5-symmetry of a system .",
    "now , we apply the principle to the wg micro - ring as depicted in fig.@xmath27[sketch](b ) , where @xmath5 denotes an angle @xmath28 .",
    "mode amplitudes in wg micro - ring evolve as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an integer corresponding to the angular momentum ( mode index ) of the mode , and @xmath31 is the quality factor of the mode .",
    "the modes with positive and negative @xmath30 have a degenerate mode frequency but opposite propagation directions , which are called clockwise ( cw ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw ) modes . to obtain an effective coupling between cw and ccw modes with the non - zero momentum @xmath26 ,",
    "extra materials distributed sinusoidally on the inner and the outer rims are constructed , noting that there is a shifted angle @xmath32 between these two perturbations ( fig.@xmath27[sketch](b ) ) .",
    "the reactive coupling between traveling wave modes is controlled by external refractive index perturbation ( dark blue part on the micro - ring in fig.@xmath27[sketch](b ) ) , such as a dielectric pattern on the surface of the micro - ring .",
    "the dissipative coupling can be introduced by putting lossy nanoparticle or doping absorptive atom on the cavity ( orange part on the micro - ring in fig.@xmath27[sketch](b ) ) , which induces losses to cw and ccw modes simultaneously .",
    "we can formalize the effective dielectric perturbation as @xmath33+i\\delta\\varepsilon_{i}(\\cos\\omega\\theta+1)\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\delta\\varepsilon_{+}e^{i\\omega\\theta}+\\delta\\varepsilon_{-}e^{-i\\omega\\theta}+\\delta\\varepsilon_{0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . due to the phase matching condition , the term @xmath38 scatters the light in the mode @xmath30 to the mode @xmath39 .",
    "for example , in fig.@xmath27[sketch ] ( b ) we have a created momentum @xmath40 by engineering the dissipative coupling .",
    "this coupling couples @xmath41 mode to @xmath42 mode ( ( fig.@xmath27[sketch](c ) ) ) .",
    "it is worth noting that besides the phase matching condition , energy conservation is another criterion for effective coupling . as a result , mode coupling occurs between degeneracy modes with a same @xmath43 .",
    "for example , the phase matching condition between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is satisfied , but their mode frequencies are different by two free spectra ranges ( fsr ) , which is many orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic linewidth of the high-@xmath31 wg modes .",
    "so they can not couple with each other in this way .    in the following ,",
    "we take the @xmath3 modes in the micro - ring ( fig.@xmath27[sketch](b ) ) as an example , and denote the cw and ccw modes with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for simplicity .",
    "the evolution of two modes , a specific form of the eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , can be written as @xmath48 here , perturbation effect is proportional to the @xmath49 with a coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "since the light traveling in the micro - ring is with periodic boundary condition , we translate the coordinate @xmath28 to @xmath51 for convenience , where the @xmath52 is the round - trip time of the cavity .",
    "then , in a rotating frame of cavity frequency , the temporal evolution becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the reactive and dissipative coupling strength , respectively .",
    "the normal modes of the coupling system can be solved as @xmath56 where @xmath57 the eigenfrequencies are @xmath58    from the eq.@xmath27([eq : eigenvector ] ) , the ingredients of cw and ccw circulating light in the new normal modes are generally not balanced .",
    "for both normal modes , the portion of ccw light is @xmath59 . here",
    ", we define the chirality of the system as @xmath60 where @xmath61(@xmath62 ) is energy of cw(ccw ) ingredient .    in fig .",
    "[ dw](a ) , the chirality @xmath63 of the modes are theoretically calculated with respect to relative coupling strengths @xmath64 and phase differences @xmath65 .",
    "it is clearly shown that @xmath66 if @xmath55 or @xmath65 is zero , and high chirality is obtained near the points @xmath67 .",
    "specially , if we choose @xmath68 , analytical results will be simplified as @xmath69 . as shown in fig.@xmath27[dw](b ) , the system behaviors have two regions separated by points @xmath70 . in region",
    "@xmath71 $ ] , the frequency splits , i.e. @xmath72 , while the imaginary part are the same @xmath73 , thus the couplings only change the frequencies of the uncoupled degenerated cw and ccw modes . for parameter @xmath64 outside the interval ,",
    "@xmath74 are pure imaginary numbers , which removes the degeneracy by adding different losses .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , the system only supports pure ccw ( cw ) mode as @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) ( fig .",
    "[ dw](c ) ) .",
    "to check the validity of the idea about breaking chiral symmetry in traveling wave optical resonators by engineering the dissipation , we solve out eigenmodes and reflection spectra in those cavities numerically .",
    "such numerical verification is necessary , because the principle and model in previous section are idealized . in realistic systems",
    ", there should be multiple modes , and the coupled mode equations are just results of perturbation theory about the system , these approximations may lead to unpredicted effect to the chiral symmetry breaking .    in the following ,",
    "the model proposed in fig.@xmath27[sketch](b ) is simulated by finite element method ( comsol multiphysics ) . in the simulation , only the geometry and the dielectric constant of the ring distribution",
    "are set in the software .",
    "the eigenmodes and propagations of light are obtained by using the numerical method to solve the maxwell equations , without any assumptions .",
    "therefore , the numerical results in the following part will provide an independent and experiment - feasible verification to our theory .",
    "the geometry of model in comsol is the same as that in fig .",
    "[ sketch](b ) , but simplified in two - dimensional model . in this model , the radii of inner and outer circle are @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , so the width of the ring is @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , amplitudes of both sinusoidal curves are @xmath82 , and shift @xmath83 away from rims to avoid sharp structure which arises singularity in the simulation . in the material side ,",
    "the dielectric constant of the main body of the ring is @xmath84 .",
    "the inner and outer parts sinusoidal curves inclosed dielectric perturbation ( @xmath85 ) of imaginary ( @xmath85@xmath86 ) and real ( @xmath85@xmath87 ) part , respectively .",
    "the @xmath85@xmath86 and the @xmath85@xmath87 are three orders of magnitude less than @xmath88 to insure the validation of the perturbation approximation . as mentioned in the above analysis , the coupling strength @xmath55 ( @xmath54 ) should be proportional to the perturbation @xmath85@xmath86 ( @xmath85@xmath87 ) @xcite .",
    "due to the asymmetric field distribution in the inner and outer rim of the micro - ring resonator , the balanced reactive and dissipative couplings are achieved with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it should be noticed that the sign of @xmath91 determines whether the materials loss ( @xmath92 ) or gain ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath91 changes easily either in theory or in simulation , but in practical experiments loss is preferred for convenience .",
    "we performed the simulation with fixed @xmath68 and @xmath90 but varies @xmath91 from @xmath94 to @xmath95 corresponding to that @xmath64 varies from @xmath96 to @xmath97 . to compare with the theory ,",

    "higher reflection can be achieved by increasing coupling strength @xmath54 , and the maximum achievable @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "in addition , we also check the chiral symmetry breaking for @xmath110 mode . due to the mismatch of energy , reflection is negligible ( figs.@xmath27[trans](b ) and ( d ) insert ) . in backward input situation ,",
    "reflection is negligible as well ( figs.@xmath27[trans](c ) and ( d ) red line ) .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate the proposed structure in experiment by fabricating nanostrucutres on the top of a on - chip micro - ring resonator .",

    "a limitation of the approach studied here is the induced dissipation to the system . the symmetry breaking is realized with the penalty that a part of energy losses into environment . for the cavities studied here ,",
    "the best theoretical asymmetry in spectrum is 1/4 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rb ] ) . in principle , such limitation can be mitigated by replacing the dissipative coupling with a gaining one , or say , by changing the sign of coupling . in this case , the symmetry breaking is obtained without additional loss .    the results presented in fig.@xmath27[dw ] show similar behaviors observed in the study of parity - time ( pt ) symmetry @xcite and exceptional point ( ep ) @xcite in optical cavities .",
    "actually , the perfect chirality is obtained at ep , which is common in non - hermitian systems .",

    "one straightforward generalization is breaking the forward and backward symmetry for wave propagating in two coupled straight waveguides .",
    "the wave is not limited to be light .",
    "it can be any coherent wave source , such as microwave , acoustic wave , spin wave and water wave .",
    "another interesting generalization is breaking time - reversal symmetry , i.e. @xmath133 . in this case , if we apply temporal modulations on the dissipative and reactive coupling between systems , the non - reciprocal wave propagation can be realized @xcite .",
    "we should aware that this approach for non - reciprocity does not conflict with the lorentz reciprocal theorem , because the temporal modulations are nonlinear effects which lead to the non - reciprocity .",
    "in summary , an approach to break the chiral symmetry of light in a traveling wave microresonator is proposed and verified by numerical simulations .",
    "though the discussion is focusing on the chiral symmetry breaking in coordinate @xmath28 , the same concept can be used to break symmetry in coordinate @xmath134 if we straighten the ring into a straight waveguide .",
    "this concept also can be used to break time symmetry or others if we introduce two modulations on @xmath135 or other physical quantities . in terms of @xmath135 , a modulation on the refractive index by @xmath135 in the entirety system together with another modulation in phase and with the same magnitude modulation on loss ( gain ) can break the time symmetry .",
