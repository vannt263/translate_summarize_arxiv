    "introduction of an optical trap liberates them to allow bec to be in a superposition of magnetic sublevels .",
    "therefore , the spinor bec can be represented by a vector order parameter .",
    "the @xmath2 spinor bec was first theoretically studied by ho@xcite , ohmi and machida@xcite by generalizing the gross - pitaevskii equation under the restriction of gauge and spin - rotation symmetry . within the mean - field theory",
    ", they predicted a rich set of new phenomena such as spin textures and topological excitations .",
    "et al._@xcite constructed an excellent algebraic representation of the @xmath2 bec hamiltonian to study the exact many - body states , and found that spin - exchange interactions cause a set of collective dynamic behavior of bec .",
    "since the spinor bec appears feasible by using the @xmath0 multiplet of bosons such as @xmath1na , @xmath3rb , or @xmath4rb , it is necessary to investigate the ground - state structure and magnetic response of @xmath0 spinor bec .",
    "recently , ciobanu",
    "_ et al_. @xcite generalized the approach for the @xmath2 spinor bec developed by ho to study the ground - state structure of the @xmath0 spinor bec .",
    "they found that there are three possible phases in zero magnetic field , which are characterized by a pair of parameters describing the ferromagnetic order and the formation of singlet pairs . from current estimates of scattering lengths",
    "they also found that the spinor bec of @xmath3rb and @xmath1na have a polar ground state , whereas those of @xmath4rb and @xmath5rb are cyclic and ferromagnetic , respectively .",
    "koashi and ueda@xcite studied the exact eigenspectra and eigenstates of @xmath0 spinor bec .",
    "they found that , compared to @xmath2 spinor bec , the @xmath0 spinor bec exhibits an even richer magnetic response due to quantum correlations among three bosons .",
    "different from superfluid @xmath6he , a new feature in a spinor bec is that its response to an external magnetic field is dominated by the electronic rather than nuclear spin .",
    "this opens up possibilities of manipulating the magnetism of superfluid vapors .",

    "in this paper we investigate the time evolution of the @xmath0 spinor bec in the presence of external magnetic fields with longitudinal and transverse field strengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . here",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field lifts the energy degeneracy of the spin states through zeeman effects , whereas the transverse field appears as a coupling between different spin components .",
    "we assume the longitudinal field to be time - dependent and that the transverse field is static .",
    "using perturbation theory , a general formula for the oscillation period to describe the passing across the initial spin - polarized state is obtained .",

    "furthermore , since this paper deals with the quantum coherent behavior of the system under the influence of the external magnetic fields , we assume that the initial spin state of the bec is the eigenstate in the absence of external fields , consequently , contribution from hamiltonian ( 6 ) is a constant energy shift , and can be neglected in the dynamics .",
    "the semiclassical equations of motion in heisenberg representation can be derived from the hamiltonian @xmath41 ( we introduce the state vector @xmath50 )    @xmath51    where @xmath52 here we have defined @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the time evolution of the system has a rich set of intriguing features with different initial conditions . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case that the system begins with unperturbed spin-0 state @xmath55 , i.e. , the @xmath56 polar phase defined by ciobanu _ et al._@xcite .",
    "this phase is possible to be realized in @xmath3rb and @xmath57na .",
    "in this section , we analyze the time evolution of @xmath0 bec described by eq .",

    ", we obtain the time evolution of the population of spin-@xmath47 state as    @xmath69    where @xmath70 , and the matrix element is defined as    @xmath71    in particular , the population of the initial spin-0 state at time @xmath72 is    @xmath73    thus to the first - order approximation in @xmath74 we obtain the analytical expression of the evolution probability for the spinor bec remaining in the initial polar state .",
    "expression ( 17 ) is valid for arbitrary time - dependent external magnetic fields .",
    "obviously , @xmath75 can be expanded as a discrete fourier series , and the time integral is either bounded or increases linearly in time ( on top of an oscillatory piece ) . in the former case",
    ", @xmath76 remains close to unity at all times because of the smallness of @xmath74 .",
    "this high population of the initial spin state is just the spin localization . in the latter case , @xmath76 oscillates between @xmath77 and @xmath78 , implying population transfer between @xmath76 and other @xmath79 ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) .",
    "hence we have the spin delocalization , i.e. , rabi oscillation .",
    "thus , we obtain the oscillation period @xmath82 as    @xmath83    this result is still valid for any time - dependent external fields .",
    "we give two examples of special time - dependent external magnetic fields .",
    "\\(a ) sinusoidal field @xmath84",
    ". according to eq . ( 18 ) , the oscillation period is     @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind . from this result",
    ", it can be seen that when @xmath87 , there exists a finite oscillation period , indicating that the population can transit from an initial polar state to other spin states within the driving process . when @xmath88 , the longitudinal field - free oscillation has period @xmath89 .",
    "the fact @xmath90 implies that @xmath91 .",
    "this shows that the invasion of the longitudinal magnetic field will suppress the coherent population transfer among the five spin components .",
    "the extreme case occurs when the reduced amplitude of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath92 is a root of @xmath86 . in this case , we have @xmath93 , which implies that the population transfer is totally suppressed",
    ". hence the system will stay in the initial polar state during the whole driving process .",
    "this is just the phenomenon of spin localization .",
    "the above analysis is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , where the scaled oscillation period @xmath94 is plotted against @xmath92 .",
    "it can be seen that the oscillation period increases significantly when @xmath92 approaches the roots of bessel function @xmath86 .",
    "\\(b ) a combination of static and sinusoidal magnetic fields @xmath95 . in this case , the oscillation period is    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the anger function@xcite defined by    @xmath98    there exists an infinite oscillation period when @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is an integer ) , which means that the population time evolution will undergo localization in the initially populated spin-0 state during the whole driving process . when @xmath101 , the oscillation period becomes    @xmath102    where @xmath103 are @xmath100-th order bessel functions . from this result , we find that we can have a finite oscillation period only when @xmath92 is not equal to a root of @xmath103 , and in this case the evolution of the initial polar phase is delocalized into other spin states .",
    "if @xmath92 becomes a root of @xmath103 , the oscillation period approaches infinity , and we have the spin localization .",
    "in practice , since the external magnetic field may have a fluctuation component , the effects of external noise has to be considered .",
    "another motivation for the introduction of an external noise is to provide the fluctuations required to destroy the coherence of the population transfer process and , in suitable cases , leads to a rate process for the decay of the population . in the following , we study the dynamics of the system when the external magnetic field has a fluctuating component . in the simplest case ,",
    "the statistical properties of the imposed magnetic field can be prescribed to be independent of the characteristics of the system . as a versatile choice for the noise , an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou )",
    "process@xcite is used .",
    "this permits the investigation of the role of the strength and size of correlation time of the noise on the time evolution of the spinor bec . without loss of generality",
    ", the external longitudinal magnetic field @xmath104 is assumed to contain two components , a stochastic part @xmath105 and a systematic part @xmath106 , i.e. ,    @xmath107    the noise @xmath105 is assumed to be characterized by an ou process whereby it has zero average value and correlation function    @xmath108    here the quantities @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the strength and decay constant of the noise , respectively .",
    "when the noise is external to the system , and therefore not necessarily thermal in character , @xmath109 and @xmath111 can be varied in a controlled manner , and are not restricted by the physical properties of the system . in the absence of an analytic solution , a numerical investigation of population @xmath112 is adapted .",
    "the population distribution in the five components of spinor bec with the external noise are solved numerically by generating trajectories for the different realization of the noise .",
    "the procedure@xcite to integrate the stochastic equations is as follows .",
    "a stochastic term is added at each step with its statistical properties described by an ou process .",
    "the ou process is generated by solving a langevin equation with a delta - correlated noise term .",
    "this ensures that the correlation function of @xmath105 has the desired statistical property given by eq .",
    "( 24 ) .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "2 the time evolution of the population @xmath113 of spin-0 state in the static magnetic field [ @xmath114 in eq . ( 23 ) ] for the value of @xmath115 . in the absence of noise , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the population of spin-0 state is always close to unity during time evolution .",
    "this effect is purely the static spin localization . in this case , the longitudinal magnetic field lifts the degeneracy of the five spin components and consequent energy mismatch hinders the bec transfer from the initially occupied polar state to its neighbours in the spin space . in the case of the intermediate ( @xmath116 ) noise modulation , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) ( solid curve ) , it can be seen that the population of spin-0 state has a damped oscillation with a slow monotonic decay superimposed .",
    "the combination of noise and static magnetic field , suppressing population transfer , produces the decay .",
    "it also shows in fig .",
    "2(b ) that with increasing strength of noise , the decay becomes more rapid .",
    "therefore , the decaying time can be controlled by varying the magnetic field or the strength of noise .",
    "figure 3 shows the time dependencies of @xmath113 in the time - dependent longitudinal magnetic field with the systematic part @xmath117 .",
    "the field parameters are chosen as @xmath118 and @xmath119 , corresponding to the rabi oscillation with scaled period @xmath120 , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) . in the case of a weak noise @xmath121 ( dashed curve ) , the population @xmath76 is still oscillatory in our scope of time , but its oscillation amplitude decreases with time .",
    "when the strength of the noise increases to @xmath122 ( dotted curve ) , the rabi oscillation breaks down completely and the system decays fast towards equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that the coherent rabi oscillation for a spinor bec is sensitive to the external noise and is destroyed even in a weak coupling regime .",
    "we also present in fig .",
    "4 the time evolution of @xmath76 for the value of @xmath123 , corresponding to the dynamic localization , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , we can see that in the case of intermediate ( @xmath124 ) noise modulation ( solid curve ) , the population @xmath76 still remains close to unity for an extremely long time .",
    "this insensitivity to the presence of weak noise reflects the strength of the systematic field . when the strength of noise increases to a strong coupling regime , a more rapid and less oscillatory decay is observed in the population evolution , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) ( dotted curve ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the time evolution of @xmath125 in the external longitudinal magnetic fields consisting of static and time - periodic components [ eq .",
    "the field parameters are chosen as @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , corresponding to the spin dynamic localization , as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) . in the case of intermediate ( @xmath129",
    ") noise modulation , similar to that shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the population @xmath130 of spin-0 state remains close to unity in our scope of time .",
    "even in the strong coupling regime ( dashed curve ) , the fast oscillations still exist , suggesting the fundamental interplay between the systematic and noise fields . with further increase of the strength of noise ,",
    "the system decays rapidly towards equilibrium , and therefore , the spinor bec initially localized in spin-0 state is delocalized and diffuses among all spin states , as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) ( dotted curve ) .",
    "in the above discussions , the single - mode assumption ( sma ) has been used : the wave function for each spin component retains the same spatial profile during the time development .",
    "therefore , the possibility of high - energy mode excitation is neglected and the system dynamics is fully described by the internal population transfer among the spin components .",
    "this sma treatment is valid for a small particle number @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath32 is large , the nonlinear spin - mixing processes induce the large energy transfer from the initial ground state to the excited modes , thus destroying the validity of the sma .",
    "however , when the initial state is taken to be the eigenstate of the mean - field g - p equation , the sma is expected to describe well the dynamics in the absence of dissipation and external driving@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we go beyond the sma by means of a numerical simulation of the time - spatial evolution of the system .    due to anisotropic nature of the optical trapping potential ,",
    "the cigar shaped bec is assumed to be quasi - one - dimensional and hence the wave function associated with the spin-@xmath47 state may be written as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the direction of weak confinement , @xmath133 is the ground - state wave function of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , and @xmath134 the tight confinement frequency . inserting eq .",
    "( 25 ) into eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we obtain the equations of motion for the longitudinal wave functions @xmath135 in a dimensionless form @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 where @xmath141 with transverse structure factor @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",
    "the above equations have been written in dimensionless form and the units for length , energy , and time are @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 , respectively , where @xmath150 is the axial trapping frequency . in the numerical simulation of the dynamic equations ( 26 ) ,",
    "the initial wave functions are taken to be ground state of the one - dimension g - p equations @xmath151 , where @xmath152 satisfies the normalization @xmath153 with @xmath154 the initial particle number in spin-@xmath155 component .",
    "we first discuss the dynamics of the system in the absence of coupling magnetic fields .",
    "figure 6 shows the time evolution of the population of spin-@xmath77 component for two kinds of initial population . the solid line in fig .",
    "6 corresponds to the initial state that five spin components are initially equally populated , whereas the dotted line corresponds to the case that the bec initially populates spin-0 components .",
    "it shows ( solid line ) that during time evolution , the population of spin-0 component develops into a complex oscillatory structure , implying the excitation of high - energy modes .",
    "the excitation originates from the fact that the initial state is not a mean - field eigenstate of the sma hamiltonian ( 6 ) , thus leading to a redistribution of the total energy @xmath156 between the symmetric and unsymmetrical parts ( denoted by @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively ) of the total hamiltonian .",
    "when @xmath158 is sufficiently large , the higher modes are excited by the nonlinear spin - mixing processes and the sma description breaks down for large value of particle number @xmath32 .",
    "when the initial state is chosen to be the sma eigenstate , the population of spin-@xmath77 state does not vary in time ( dotted line ) .",
    "thus , sma treatment is appropriate for the spin polarized state with the bec localized in spin-0 component .    in the presence of external magnetic fields ,",
    "the five spin components are coupled .",
    "the atomic population is featured by rabi oscillations among the spin states . to see the validity of the sma in studying the dynamic spin localization , we present in fig . 7 the time evolution of the population of spin-0 state for several values of amplitude of oscillatory magnetic field .",
    "it shows that the weak transverse magnetic field couples the five spin components , inducing rabi oscillation between the initial populated spin-0 state and the other spin states .",
    "the presence of an additional oscillatory magnetic field slows down the oscillation periods . finally , when the field parameter is modulated to satisfy @xmath159 , as shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , the rabi oscillation completely stops and population of spin-0 state always remains close to unity during its time development .",
    "the good agreement between the sma results and exact numerical solution suggests that _ the phenomenon of dynamic spin localization is well - defined beyond the simple sma .",
    "_ this robustness of dynamic localization against nonlinear atomic interaction is contrast to the case of two - component bec system , where there is no energy - stable spin - polarized states .",
    "in summary , by the application of the external magnetic fields which may contain a random component , we have elaborated on the control of population transfer among the internal spin states for the @xmath0 spinor bec . after taking the mean - field approximation",
    "a general formula is obtained for the oscillation period to describe the quantum transition from the initial spin polar state to other spin states . in particular ,",
    "when the frequency and reduced amplitude of the longitudinal magnetic field are related in a specific manner , the population of the initial spin-0 state is dynamically localized during the time evolution .",
    "in addition , the effects of external noise on the coherent population transfer dynamics of the spinor bec are studied .",
    "we found that ( i ) the rabi oscillations are sensitive to the external noise , and even weak coupling can destroy completely the rabi oscillations in an earlier length of time .",
    "( ii ) when the strength of noise is weak , because of strong suppression caused by the systematic field , the static and dynamic localization may remain for experimentally relevant times .",
    "( iii ) when the strength of noise is strong ,  delocalization due to phase randomness occurs during time evolution and the initially localized bec diffuses among five spin components .",
    "( iv ) the rabi oscillation and dynamic spin localization is robust against the nonlinear spin exchange interaction . thus in order to observe the static or dynamic localization in spin space one should produce stable magnetic fields , which has as little as possible the stochastic component .",
    "although it is difficult to keep the external noise from intruding on dynamics , recent observation of the well - defined coherence between the two becs@xcite suggests that the external noise can be greatly suppressed in experimental setup .",
    "therefore , we expect such macroscopic coherent quantum controls as rabi oscillation and dynamic localization may be realized in spinor bec experiments .",
