    "we are interested first in the study of the static casimir effect for such a theory when the field is assumed to be bounded in a three - dimensional region . in other words , we are interested in a space having the form @xmath11 , where as @xmath12 one can take any manifold permitting an exact casimir effect calculation",
    ". it can be @xmath13 or any other compact manifold with a known spectrum of the dalembertian operator .",

    "suppose now that our gut lives in such a three - dimensional space , where the size of the space is a dynamical variable ( moving mirror or moving universe ) .",
    "hence , we will be interested in the dynamical casimir effect in a three - dimensional region and the back - reaction from the induced radiation on the moving background geometry .",
    "we shall use the adiabatic approximation in this study .",
    "a great simplification comes from adopting a physical picture in which the casimir effect is described as an effective action in curved spacetime ( see @xcite for an introduction ) . here",
    ", spacetime is taken to be an expanding universe with topology @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding metric is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 for @xmath14 ( coordinates are restricted by all radii being equal ) , or the line element of a three - dimensional sphere @xmath15 .",

    "the same reference gives the value @xmath62 so each term in eq .",

    "imposition of periodic boundary conditions at the boundaries of the field volume is a basic physical ingredient in expressions such as eqs .",
    "( [ 3.1 ] ) , ( [ 3.2 ] ) for the casimir energy .",
    "it is analogous to the imposition of perfect conducting boundary conditions , or more generally , electromagnetic boundary conditions , at the walls , when considering ordinary electrodynamics , for example within a spherical volume .",
    "the physical outcome of a calculation of this kind is the residual energy remaining when the influence of the local stresses is separated off .",
    "( presumably , such stresses are absorbed in a kind of renormalization of physical parameters . )",
    "the field theoretical calculation is able to cope only with the cutoff independent part of the physical stress ; the local cutoff dependent parts of the stress are automatically lost in the zeta - function regularization process .",
    "this is an important point whenever the result of the field theoretical calculation is to be compared with experiments .    as a typical example of this sort",
    ", we may mention the calculation of the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball .",
    "one may adopt a field theoretical viewpoint ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite ) , from which the casimir energy is calculated as a cutoff independent , positive , expression .",
    "more detailed considerations , using quantum mechanical perturbation theory @xcite ( cf .  also @xcite ) , or quantum statistical mechanics",
    "@xcite show however how this expression is to be supplemented with attractive cutoff dependent parts .",
    "such terms are presumably not observable . as for the cutoff independent term ,",
    "agreement between the methods is found , so the situation is in this respect satisfactory .",
    "now let us turn to a simplified discussion of the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "we here take into account that we have a dynamical radius @xmath65 , @xmath2 being a dimensionless scale factor .",
    "then , the total effective action is given as @xmath66 where @xmath3 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) and @xmath67 as displayed in eq .",
    "( [ 3.8 ] ) .",

    "we associate a mass @xmath4 with the scale factor @xmath5 , and take the corresponding kinetic energy to be given by @xmath6 .",
    "our essential idea is that the geometrical configuration of the space is treated classically and that the gut field is a quantum object which induces the casimir effect .",
    "one might in principle introduce other expressions for the kinetic energy , but this expression is clearly the simplest choice that one can make .",
    "the newtonian form is moreover in correspondence with our use of the adiabatic approximation , meaning that @xmath69 ; cf .",
    "also the analogous argument in @xcite in connection with the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional case .",

    "we denote the @xmath81 solution by @xmath82 ; it satisfies the equation @xmath83 implying @xmath84      if the casimir energy is attractive , as actually realized in our illustrative calculation given in sec .  3 ,",

    "( [ 4.7 ] ) becomes equal to zero , and we get the casimir solution @xmath88 it is worth noticing here that the proportionality of @xmath82 to @xmath89 is precisely the behaviour shown by the scale factor in the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "this may be surprising at first sight , but does not seem to be so unreasonable after all , since the einstein - de sitter universe is flat , thus in correspondence with our neglect of riemannian curvature terms in the formalism above .",
