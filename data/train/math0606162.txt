    "there is a special reason why someone might want to count immersed two - holed tori in @xmath1 .",
    "to explain , we introduce the 2-holed torus graph @xmath152 of @xmath1 .",
    "the vertex set @xmath153 of @xmath154 is the set of oriented closed geodesics of @xmath1 .",
    "there is a directed edge from @xmath155 to @xmath156 iff there exists an immersed @xmath157-injective 2-holed torus @xmath158 such that if @xmath158 is given the orientation induced by @xmath1 then the boundary of @xmath158 is @xmath159 ( where @xmath160 means @xmath156 with the opposite orientation ) .",
    "a directed cycle in @xmath154 corresponds to an immersed _ closed _",

    "the fundamental group of @xmath18 injects into the fundamental group of @xmath1 .    the definition of a 2-holed torus graph can be generalized to the case when @xmath1 is not a surface except that the vertices then correspond to unoriented geodesics and the edges to ( unoriented ) immersed @xmath157-injective 2-holed tori",
    ". cycles still correspond to immersed surfaces but these need not be @xmath157-injective .",
    "it can be shown using the methods in this paper that every vertex of @xmath154 has infinite valence .",
    "if @xmath1 contains an immersed @xmath157-injective closed surface , then @xmath154 necessarily contains directed cycles .",
    "it would be interesting to have a more ergodic - theoretic proof that @xmath154 contains directed cycles when @xmath1 is closed surface .",
    "note that path components of @xmath154 correspond to homology classes of @xmath1 .    for @xmath161 let @xmath162 be the subgraph of @xmath44 induced by the set of vertices @xmath163 whose underlying oriented geodesic has length in the interval @xmath150 $ ] .",
    "therefore the the classical prime geodesic theorem implies that the number of vertices of @xmath162 is asymptotic to @xmath164 . to obtain asymptotics for the number of edges of @xmath162 we proceed as in the previous example .",
    "so fix a component @xmath165 and let @xmath166 be a fundamental domain for the action of the mapping class group on @xmath167 .    for each @xmath168 ,",

    ", we can not directly apply the theorem above because the sets we are interested in are not @xmath112 neighborhoods and do not necessarily have telescoping pants decompositions .",
    "but the same tricks used in the previous theorem apply here as well",
    ". therefore @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the weil - petersson volume of @xmath178 .",
    "according to [ mirzakhani , 2006 ] @xmath179 is a polynomial of degree 4 in @xmath180 .",
    "the leading coefficients of this polynomial are given by a recursive formula which seems feasible to compute but we did not do it .",
    "so all we can say is that there is some constant @xmath181 such that @xmath182 therefore , the average degree of a vertex in the graph @xmath162 is @xmath183 it would be interesting to know the degree sequence of this graph .",
    "a discrete faithful homomorphism @xmath120 determines a subgroup @xmath184 .",
    "let @xmath185 be the associated covering space .",
    "@xmath186 is naturally endowed with a hyperbolic metric so that @xmath187 is a local isometry .",
    "let @xmath18 be the convex core of @xmath186 .",
    "the map @xmath188 is a locally isometric immersion .",
    "if @xmath189 is @xmath3-conjugate to @xmath190 , then the induced immersion @xmath191 is related to @xmath192 by an isometry @xmath193 in the sense that @xmath194 .",
    "thus up to this natural equivalence relation , a character @xmath75 \\in x(f,\\gamma)$ ] determines a locally isometric immersion @xmath192 .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "so the problem of counting characters is equivalent to the problem of counting locally isometric immersions .    by decomposing @xmath18 into pants",
    "we see that it suffices to count locally isometric immersions of a pair of pants @xmath195 which satisfy various geometric and boundary constraints .",
    "to be more precise , we need to answer questions of the following type .    given a closed geodesic @xmath196 in @xmath1 , what is the number of immersed pants @xmath197 in @xmath1 with one boundary component of @xmath197 equal to @xmath196 and such that the other boundary components have lengths in prespecified intervals ?",
    "because we also care about twist parameters , we need to be able to count the number of such pants with additional restrictions on the relative positions of the other boundary components with respect to @xmath196 .",
    "another type of question we need to answer is as follows . given two closed geodesics @xmath198 , what is the number of immersed pants @xmath197 in @xmath1 with two of its boundary components equal to @xmath199 and @xmath200 and such that the other boundary component has length in a prespecified interval ?",
    "twist parameters come into play here as well .    to answer both questions observe that a hyperbolic structure on a pair of pants is determined by the lengths of its 3 boundary components .",
    "but the hyperbolic structure is also determined by the lengths of just 2 boundary components if the length of the shortest arc between those two is already known .",
    "the shortest arc is perpendicular to both components .",
    "so rather than counting pants immersions directly , it suffices to count `` pairs of eyeglasses '' ; a pair of eyeglasses is a triple @xmath201 such that @xmath202 are closed geodesics in @xmath1 and @xmath196 is a segment that is perpendicular to both @xmath203 and @xmath204 at its endpoints .",
    "such a triple uniquely determines a locally isometric immersion of a pair of pants into @xmath1 .",
    "( indeed , the pair of pants is homotopy equivalent to a regular neighborhood of @xmath205 ) .",
    "both questions can be further reduced ( by a change of variables ) , to counting the number of perpendiculars between two segments .",
    "that is , we now suppose @xmath202 are oriented geodesic segments in @xmath1 and ask how many perpendiculars are there between @xmath203 and @xmath204 with length in some prespecified interval .",
    "it seems possible that this question has appeared elsewhere but we were unable to find it in the literature .",
    "we describe the pertinent result here in a little more detail since it may be of independent interest .",
    "we allow @xmath203 and @xmath204 to depend on a parameter we denote by @xmath19 . for @xmath206 let @xmath207 be the set of unit tangents vectors perpendicular to @xmath208 .",
    "any segment @xmath196 perpendicular to @xmath203 and @xmath204 determines vectors @xmath209 tangent to @xmath196 at its endpoints .",
    "let @xmath210 be the measure on @xmath211 defined by setting @xmath212 equal to the number of perpendicular segments @xmath196 with @xmath213 .",

    "an analogous statement holds in dimension 3 .",
    "see theorem [ thm : perp ] for a precise statement .    in summary , we first prove an asymptotic formula for the number of perpendiculars between two segments .",
