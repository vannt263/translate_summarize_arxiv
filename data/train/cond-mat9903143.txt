    "the concept of skyrmion was introduced by t. skyrme when he represented the nucleon , a fermion , as a topological excitation ( soliton ) of the bosonic pion field @xcite . in the quantum hall ferromagnet , skyrmions are the solitons in the spin space of the non linear field theory for electrons , and have spin much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "+ the theory for the skyrmions , in the 2-d electron gas subject to strong magnetic fields , was developed by shondi et al @xcite based on an effective generalized non linear sigma model ( @xmath1 ) which was deduced from the landau - ginzburg theory of spinful electrons @xcite .",
    "shondi s conjecture was experimentally confirmed by barrett and co - workers in the optically pumped nuclear magnetic resonance experiments @xcite . from both works , @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it can be seen that this topological excitations are detectable in the quantum hall ferromagnet when the exchange interaction dominates over the zeeman coupling .",
    "this situation is possible due to the smallness of the effective land factor ( @xmath2 ) in some particular materials , as in the @xmath3 case .",
    "if this is so , the simple creation or destruction of an electron in the fully occupied spin polarized landau level , @xmath4 for instance , do not produce the low energy configuration to be considered the lowest lying charged excitation . on the contrary ,",
    "a non - uniform cylindrically symmetric spin configuration is produced , in which the spin at the centre is pointing in the wrong direction and smootly rotates as one moves radially outwards until it reaches the right direction according to the polarized state of the 2-dimensional electron gas . later on , hartree - fock numerical calculations @xcite showed that the energy of the quantum hall skyrmion excitation is always smaller than the excitation energy of the localized spin @xmath0 quasiparticle and quasihole , supporting the idea that the skyrmions are for sure the relevant quasiparticles in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "+ in practice it is convenient to regard the skyrmion as a topological object . from this point of view",
    "they can be described as the non - singular mapping of the compactified 2-d real space ( @xmath6 ) onto the 2-d internal space ( @xmath7 ) whose elements are the unitarily normalized spin vectors which cover a 2-d spherical surface .",
    "all non - singular maps of @xmath8 onto @xmath8 can be classified into homotopy classes that form a group isomorphic to the group of integers . and , it is using this set of integers , that we define the topological charge or pontryaguin index @xmath9 , that classifies the skyrmions .",
    "this topological charge can be shown to be a simple measure of the degree of mapping of one surface onto the other and , as a conserved number , helps in finding explicit expressions for the spin configurations ( see @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "+ until now many theoretical studies were devoted to the properties of the quantum hall skyrmions .",
    "most of them are done following two main approches ; the quantum computational calculations and the non - linear semi - classical field theory . in the first case ,",
    "the quantum hartree - fock calculations are shown to be in excellent agreement with exact diagonalizations for small skyrmion sizes , as is demostrated in @xcite . however , when hydrostatic pressure is applied to the quantum hall ferromagnet the @xmath2 factor almost vanishes . in that case there is strong experimental evidence @xcite that skyrmions of large size ( about 33 reversed spins ) are dominant . in this particular situation",
    "computational calculations are not appropriate , making the development of new approaches in the semi - classical field theoretical methods the natural way out to explain the experimental data .",
    "+ in this paper , starting from a specific lagragian density @xcite , we investigate the influence of the ferromagnetic spin wave modes in the temperature dependent dynamical properties of an isolated skyrmion .",
    "our model basically consists of an effective field theory in which the single skyrmion momentum is coupled to the magnon bath total momentum . to begin with",
    ", sec ii is devoted to obtaining the ferromagnetic spin wave modes by computing the quantum fluctuations of the quantum hall ferromagnet around the non - linear sigma model classical solutions .",
    "later on , using the standard collective coordinate method a second quantized hamiltonian that simulates the scattering of the spin waves by the skyrmion in @xmath10-d is obtained .",
    "iii , using the well known feynman - vernon formalism we obtain an effective equation of motion for the centre of mass of the skyrmion .",
    "this equation , that contains all the information about the skyrmion - magnon interaction , is written in terms of a temperature dependent damping matrix function . in our treatment",
    "the possible contribution of inelastic process ( cherenkov like radiation ) to the soliton dynamics is considered .",
    "finally secs .",
    "iv and v are devoted to the explicit calculation of the damping constant matrix elements that define the skyrmion mobility and to present our conclusions .",

    "+ despite of the complex form of ( [ popo ] ) , the solutions of ( [ sho ] ) for the @xmath52-th cylindrical wave component of the ferromagnetic spin waves confined in a cylindrical region of radius @xmath53 can be written as the sum of two contributions @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the hankel functions of first and second kind respectively and @xmath56 is the phase shift matrix which connects the @xmath52 and @xmath57 angular momentum channels .",
    "the first term of the right hand side of ( [ funo ] ) correspond to the incident cylindrically symmetric wave whereas the second term is associated to the shifted @xmath57-th component after the interaction with the potential @xmath58 has taken place .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ popo ] ) , the potential involved in the scattering processes is cylindrically symmetric , therefore @xmath59 is a diagonal matrix and ( [ funo ] ) becomes @xmath60    to calculate the phase shifts for each angular momentum component we used the fredholm method @xcite . in so doing it is convenient to start from the well - known relation , @xmath61 where @xmath62 means the cauchy principal value , and @xmath63",

    "this condition is automatically satisfied by the @xmath69 @xmath70 functions . therefore substituting ( [ ai ] ) into ( [ ae ] )",

    "then , the phase shift for each @xmath52 angular momentum component is given by @xmath77 where we have used @xmath78 to denote the expression @xmath79    so , until now , our model for the quantum hall ferromagnet is composed by a set of static cylindrically symmetric skyrmion excitations given by ( [ pork])-([taka ] ) and non interacting spin waves modes described by ( [ simple ] ) and ( [ aene])-([phase ] ) with frequencies @xmath80 where the momenta @xmath81 can be determined from the boundary condition @xmath82 . therefore using the asymptotic expansion of ( [ simple ] ) we get @xmath83    on the classical level , due to the translational invariance of the system , the skyrmions can move freely , and the position of its centre of mass will be enough to describe its motion . however , if we look at the problem from the quantum field theoretical point of view , the skyrmion will be a particle and its centre of mass a dynamical variable .",
    "in this picture , due to the excitation of the spin wave modes at finite @xmath84 , not all of the degrees of freedom of the system will contribute to the skyrmion formation , this can be interpreted as the origin of the residual skyrmion - magnon interaction that leads to a non trivial dynamics of these objects . to show that , we explicitly evaluate the equation of motion for the @xmath44 field ( our skyrmion field now ) from the equations ( [ son]),([tun ] ) and ( [ seee ] ) .",

    ". then we need to compute only one of its componenets , for instance , @xmath204 which , after some integration and assuming large values of @xmath53 becomes @xmath205 -\\lambda^{(4)}_{lm}{\\cal p}\\frac{k}{k - k^{\\prime } } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\pi^2 \\delta_{l , m}}{l^{2}\\sqrt { kk^{\\prime } } } \\left[i\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\lambda^{(2)}_{lm}+(c_i(k - k^{\\prime})\\lambda^{(4)}_{lm } - c_i(k+k^{\\prime})\\lambda^{(6)}_{lm } \\right ] \\label{gij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 stands for @xmath207 and the set of expressions @xmath208 are defined by @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath211 @xmath212 @xmath213 @xmath214    expression ( [ gij ] ) allows us to write a continuum version of ( [ scatt ] ) for the matrix damping function diagonal elements @xmath215",
    ". explicitly @xmath216 where @xmath217    now , using ( [ gij])-([deff ] ) we can evaluate ( [ hhdd ] ) and obtain an explicit expression of @xmath218 which , by the time , allow us to get the analytic form of @xmath219 in terms of the variables @xmath220 and @xmath187 introduced before .",
    "then , the limit given by ( [ chuva ] ) yields @xmath221 with @xmath222 where the phase shifts @xmath223 are also functions of @xmath220 .    the matrix damping coefficient elements ( [ land ] ) can be written now as @xmath224    in computing this final expression ( [ pvc ] ) we need a numerical evaluation of the phase shift functions defined by ( [ aene])-([phase ] ) .",
    "this was done taking the magnetic field @xmath225 for three different values of the land factor @xmath2 or skyrmion size .",
    "however , the analysis of the high temperature regime of the skyrmion mobility can be done from ( [ pvc ] ) without explicit evaluation of @xmath226 , giving @xmath227 that increases linearly with temperature independently of the explicit form of @xmath228 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath229 in units of @xmath230 for any temperature , is shown in fig.1 .",
    "for three different values of the land factor . due to the smallness of the zeeman energy ( 0.13 mev , 0.013 mev and 0.0013 mev ) in all cases the scattering states are excited leading to a damped motion of the skyrmion",
    "although we do not have an analytic expression for @xmath229 the numerical result shows that near @xmath231 the mobility presents a power law behaviour @xmath232 , as can be seen from the log - log plot in fig.2 , where @xmath233 is a strong dependent land factor coefficient .",
    "here we have succeded in applying the collective coordinate method of quantum field theory to the description of the mobility of the skyrmion excitation in a quantum hall ferromagnet as a function of the temperature .",
    "we have been able to treat both elastic and inelastic effects of the skyrmion - magnon interaction and show that only the former plays a major role in the long time approximation for this problem .",
    "we have also shown that in this limit the mobility of the skyrmion is linear for high temperatures and behaves as @xmath232 for low temperatures .",
    "although we have directly addressed the problem of the quantum hall ferromagnet , our description can be straightforwardly extended to any system which can be mapped into a nl@xmath33 model or any extension thereof .",
    "an investigation of the experimental evidences of our findings is now in process .",
