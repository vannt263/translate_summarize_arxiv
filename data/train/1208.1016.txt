    "to describe the nron severi group of the k3 surfaces considered by oguiso , we introduce a lattice @xmath23 .",

    "we denote the galois conjugate of @xmath34 by @xmath35 , so @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "one has @xmath38 the norm of @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "we define a bilinear form @xmath41 so we get a lattice",
    "@xmath23 : @xmath42 one easily verifies that @xmath43    due to the factor @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 , in particular , there are no @xmath39 with @xmath46 .",
    "the equation @xmath47 has only @xmath48 as solution , since if @xmath49 with @xmath50 then @xmath51 , but this quadratic equation has no solution @xmath52 .    as @xmath53 ,",
    "the map @xmath54 is an isometry of the lattice @xmath23 with inverse @xmath55 .",
    "composing this map with itself @xmath56 times gives an isometry which we denote simply by @xmath57 .",
    "the isometries of @xmath23 are given by the maps @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "to see this , we use that an isometry is given by a @xmath61 matrix @xmath62 on @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "equivalently @xmath65 has integer coefficients , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . as @xmath68 is an isometry with determinant",
    "@xmath69 , we need only consider the case @xmath70 .",
    "one finds that @xmath65 must be a matrix with rows @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus the action of @xmath65 is the multiplication by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so @xmath75 is a unit in the ring of integers @xmath76 $ ] of @xmath77 .",
    "this group of units is well - known to be @xmath78 .",
    "thus @xmath74 implies that @xmath79 for some integer @xmath80 .    with these definitions , oguiso proved the following theorem , except for a refinement which we prove here .",
    "there exist k3 surfaces @xmath0 with @xmath81 , these form a dense subset of an 18-dimensional family of k3 surfaces .",
    "the automorphism group @xmath82 of any such surface @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath31 .",
    "any generator of @xmath82 is a fixed point free automorphism of positive entropy .",
    "moreover , there is a generator @xmath1 of @xmath82 such that @xmath83 on @xmath84 and @xmath85 on the orthogonal complement @xmath86 of @xmath22 in @xmath87 .",
    "* proof.*@xmath88 in view of theorem 4.1 in @xcite , all we need to prove is that @xmath89 and that one of its two generators acts as stated in the theorem .",
    "an automorphism @xmath90 of @xmath82 is determined by its action @xmath91 on @xmath92 ( @xcite , viii , corollary 11.2 ) .",
    "the map @xmath91 preserves the sublattices @xmath22 , @xmath86 of @xmath92 and @xmath91 is uniquely determined by its restriction to the sublattice ( of finite index ) @xmath93 of @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the restriction of @xmath91 to @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath94 preserves the hodge structure on @xmath86 and thus it preserves the two - dimensional subspace @xmath95 of @xmath96 as well as its orthogonal complement @xmath97 .",
    "the intersection form is positive , respectively negative , definite on these spaces .",
    "thus the orthogonal groups @xmath98 , @xmath99 are compact .",
    "as @xmath100 , a discrete group , also lies in a compact group , it lies in a finite set .",
    "in particular , @xmath94 has finite order .",
    "if @xmath101 , a suitable power of it will have a prime order @xmath102 , let @xmath103 be such a power of @xmath94 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath103 are thus @xmath102-th roots of unity and not all eigenvalues are equal to @xmath104 .",
    "if @xmath103 has eigenvalue @xmath104 on @xmath86 , then either the complexification of the sublattice @xmath105 of @xmath103-invariants or its orthogonal complement would contain @xmath106 .",
    "thus either the orthogonal complement of @xmath105 is contained in @xmath22 or @xmath105 itself is contained in @xmath22 .",
    "both cases contradict that @xmath86 is @xmath107 .",
    "thus @xmath108 on @xmath86 , hence also on the dual lattice @xmath109 and therefore also on the discriminant group @xmath110 ( @xcite , proposition 3.3 ) . in case",
    "@xmath111 this leads to a contradiction : @xmath103 induces an automorphism of the subgroup @xmath112 of @xmath113-torsion elements of the discriminant group .",
    "as @xmath103 has order @xmath102 and @xmath114 has order @xmath44 , @xmath103 must be the identity on @xmath112 .",
    "but then @xmath115 for all @xmath116 , a contradiction . in case @xmath117 ,",
    "one considers similarly the action of @xmath103 on the 2-torsion subgroup @xmath118 of the discriminant group to get a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath94 has order @xmath119 for some integer @xmath80 . in case @xmath120 , there is thus an integer @xmath121 such that the restriction of @xmath122 to @xmath86 has order @xmath44 . as above , we can rule out that the restriction of @xmath123 to @xmath86 has eigenvalues @xmath124 , so @xmath125 on @xmath86 and also on the discriminant group .",
    "thus @xmath123 acts as @xmath126 on the subgroup @xmath112 of the discriminant group .",
    "the actions of @xmath123 on @xmath86 and @xmath22 are related through the equality @xmath127 under the natural isomorphism of discriminant groups @xmath128 .",
    "generators of @xmath129 are given in @xcite , proposition 3.3(2 ) , and we checked that the generators @xmath68 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 of the isometry group all induce @xmath130 on the subgroup @xmath112 of the discriminant group .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 can not have an automorphism that has order four on @xmath86 .",
    "thus we must have @xmath132 and , similar to the proof of theorem 4.1 in @xcite , an automorphism of @xmath0 induces either @xmath69 on @xmath86 and @xmath133 on @xmath22 or @xmath134 on @xmath86 and @xmath135 on @xmath22 for some integer @xmath80 .",
    "so @xmath90 acts as @xmath136 or @xmath137 on @xmath93 , where @xmath1 is the fixed point free automorphism found by oguiso .",
    "therefore @xmath90 is a power of @xmath1 .",
    "we will need to know the following values of @xmath138 explicitly : @xmath139 as well as their inverses , with @xmath140 : @xmath141 the reader will notice the appearance of fibonacci numbers ( @xcite , lemma 3.1 ) : @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "in particular , one has @xmath147      with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as in theorem [ thmo ] , the eigenvalues of @xmath148 on @xmath22 are @xmath149 , and @xmath148 acts as @xmath150 on the 20-dimensional orthogonal complement @xmath86 of @xmath22 in @xmath92 .",
    "notice that @xmath151 acts as the identity on the one - dimensional cohomology groups @xmath152 for @xmath153 , that @xmath154 for @xmath155 , and that @xmath156 .",
    "thus the topological lefschetz number of @xmath151 is @xmath157 in particular , the topological lefschetz number of @xmath1 is @xmath158 , a crucial step in the proof of theorem [ thmo ] .",
    "the topological lefschetz number of @xmath159 is @xmath160 , hence @xmath159 does have fixed points ( cf .",
    "@xcite , remark 4.3 ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath161 then @xmath148 has fixed points , but it has no fixed curves since @xmath148 has no eigenvalue @xmath104 on @xmath22 . in section [ explicit ] we will present an example where @xmath159 has exactly @xmath162 fixed points ( see proposition  [ periodic ] ) .      let @xmath0 be a k3 surface with picard lattice @xmath81 as in section [ ns ] .",
    "we will fix the identification @xmath163 in such a way that if @xmath164 is an ample divisor class , so @xmath165 , then @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "as there are no elements with @xmath168 in @xmath26 , any @xmath169 with @xmath170 and @xmath167 is the class of an ample divisor on @xmath0 ( @xcite , viii , corollary ( 3.9 ) ) : @xmath171 the isometry @xmath172 of @xmath22 maps @xmath173 onto itself : @xmath174 .",
    "this is easily seen by observing that an isometry of @xmath26 extends @xmath175-linearly to an isometry of @xmath176 which maps the set @xmath177 defined by @xmath49 into itself .",
    "this set consists of two lines and the four connected components of @xmath178 are thus permuted by an isometry .",
    "the isometry @xmath172 maps @xmath179 to @xmath180 , so it fixes the connected component containing @xmath173 , hence @xmath174 .",
    "we recall the results of saint - donat which imply that any ample divisor on @xmath0 is already very ample ( cf .",
    "@xcite , remark 4.2 ) .",
    "let @xmath181 be the line bundle on @xmath0 defined by an ample divisor class @xmath164 .",
    "as the canonical bundle of @xmath0 is trivial , kodaira vanishing implies that @xmath182 for @xmath183 .",
    "the riemann - roch theorem then asserts that @xmath184 . as an ample divisor @xmath164 on @xmath0",
    "has @xmath165 , we get @xmath185 and thus we may assume that @xmath164 is effective .",
    "as @xmath186 for any divisor @xmath187 on @xmath0 , the linear system @xmath188 has no fixed components ( @xcite , @xmath8 2.7.1 , 2.7.2 ) .",
    "by @xcite , @xmath8 4.1 , the map @xmath189 defined by the global sections of @xmath181 is then either of degree two or it is birational onto its image . in the first case ,",
    "theorem 5.2 of @xcite implies that @xmath0 has a divisor @xmath187 with @xmath190 , which is not the case .",
    "so @xmath189 is birational onto its image and by theorem 6.iii of @xcite , the image of @xmath189 is isomorphic to the image of the map @xmath191 introduced in @xcite , @xmath8 4.2 .",
    "the map @xmath191 is the contraction of all smooth rational curves @xmath187 in @xmath0 with @xmath192 . as @xmath193",
    "but there are no divisor classes with @xmath193 in @xmath0 , the map @xmath191 is the identity on @xmath0 and @xmath194 is an isomorphism , i.e.  @xmath181 is very ample .      let @xmath195 be the class of an irreducible curve @xmath196 , then by adjunction @xmath197 , and thus actually @xmath165 .",
    "as also @xmath198 for any ample divisor @xmath199 , we conclude that @xmath166 with @xmath167 and therefore any curve in @xmath0 is an ample divisor . taking linear combinations with positive coefficients of classes of curves ,",
    "we conclude that any effective divisor on @xmath0 is an ample divisor .      for any integer @xmath56",
    "we define a very ample divisor class @xmath200 a basis of the global sections of the line bundle on @xmath0 defined by @xmath201 defines a projective embedding , denoted by @xmath202 , of @xmath0 in @xmath6 as a quartic surface @xmath203 : @xmath204      the remarkable fact that there is an automorphism of @xmath0 with @xmath205 implies that the quartic surfaces @xmath13 and @xmath206 are the same , after choosing suitable coordinates on the @xmath6 s .    in fact ,",
    "let @xmath207 be a basis of @xmath208 .",
    "as @xmath209 , @xmath210 has basis @xmath211 , where @xmath212 . with a slight abuse of notation",
    ", we then get for all @xmath213 : @xmath214 thus , with these bases , @xmath215 .",
    "moreover @xmath216 implies that @xmath217      to give a more concrete description of @xmath1 , we explain how , in principle , one can describe @xmath218 in terms of @xmath219 . for this",
    "we need to find @xmath210 , given the surface @xmath220 .",
    "the zero locus of a global section @xmath221 of @xmath222 is mapped to a curve in @xmath13 .",
    "this curve is not the ( complete ) intersection of @xmath13 with another surface ( of degree @xmath223 ) in @xmath6 , since such an intersection has class @xmath224 , whereas @xmath225 .",
    "the intersection of such a surface of degree @xmath223 is thus the sum of two effective divisors with classes @xmath222 , @xmath164 respectively and @xmath226 .",
    "as effective classes and ample classes coincide on @xmath0 , the smallest possible degree @xmath223 is the smallest positive integer such that @xmath227 , that is , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which is @xmath230 ( and then @xmath231 ) .",
    "let @xmath232 be the zero divisors of a basis @xmath233 , @xmath212 , of @xmath210 and similarly , let the @xmath234 be a basis of @xmath235 with zero divisor @xmath236 .",
    "then the divisor @xmath237 has class @xmath238 and it is the zero locus of the section @xmath239 in @xmath240 .",
    "consider the exact sequence of sheaves on @xmath6 : @xmath241 where the first non - trivial map is multiplication by the equation of @xmath13 and where @xmath242 is the inclusion map .",
    "as the first cohomology group @xmath243 of any invertible sheaf @xmath244 on @xmath6 is zero , and @xmath245 , we get a surjection @xmath246 therefore , for any @xmath223 , a section in @xmath247 is the restriction of a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath223 on @xmath6 .    in particular , there are homogeneous polynomials @xmath248 of degree @xmath249 in @xmath250 , such that @xmath251 considering the zero loci of these sections we get : @xmath252 the curves @xmath253 , @xmath254 in @xmath6 both have degree @xmath255 , consistent with @xmath256 .    the map @xmath218 is defined by the global sections @xmath257 of @xmath222 . since @xmath258 is very ample , for each @xmath213 there is an index @xmath259 such that @xmath260 .",
    "so ( with slight abuse of notation ) :    @xmath261    on the open subset of @xmath0 where @xmath262 , we thus have : @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the rational map given by the polynomials @xmath265 .",
    "hence on this open subset we get @xmath266 that is , if we identify @xmath0 with @xmath13 , then @xmath1 is just the rational map @xmath267 , for any @xmath259 , and these maps glue to give an isomorphism @xmath268 , which ` is ' @xmath1 .    to find @xmath218 , given @xmath219",
    ", we thus need to find these polynomials @xmath248 on @xmath6 . in practice , even if one is given that @xmath81 this seems quite difficult",
    ". however , in section [ cayleya ] , we construct explicit polynomials of degree @xmath269 which induce the map @xmath268 , corresponding to @xmath1 , using a general method due to cayley . using these polynomials , we were able to find the degree @xmath249 polynomials in the specific example in section [ explicit ] , see section [ deg18 ] .",
    "we now show that a result of beauville provides an explicit description of the k3 surfaces we are interested in : the k3 surfaces @xmath0 with nron severi group isomorphic to @xmath23 are exactly the quartic determinantal surfaces with picard number two .    more precisely , the quartic surfaces @xmath270 from section [ quas ] are all determinantal . in corollary [ class ]",
    "we show how the matrix @xmath271 which defines @xmath272 also provides explicitly the map @xmath273 , once suitable bases of global sections are chosen .",
    "this is actually part of the results of cayley in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a k3 surface with nron severi group @xmath81 as in section [ ns ] .",
    "then , for any @xmath274 , the quartic surface @xmath270 is determinantal .",
    "so there is a @xmath7 matrix @xmath275 , whose coefficients are linear forms in 4 variables @xmath250 , such that @xmath276 is an equation for @xmath272 .",
    "conversely , a general determinantal quartic surface @xmath0 has @xmath81 and thus it admits a fixed point free automorphism of positive entropy .",
    "* proof.*@xmath88the proposition is an easy consequence of @xcite , proposition 6.2 , where beauville proved that a smooth quartic surface @xmath29 is determinantal if and only if there is a curve @xmath277 of degree @xmath278 and genus @xmath279 .",
    "see also @xcite , section 4.2.5 .    given a k3 surface @xmath0 with @xmath81 , there are smooth genus three curves @xmath280 on @xmath0 with class the very ample divisor @xmath281 , for all @xmath274 ( cf .  section [ quartics ] ) .",
    "as multiplication by @xmath282 is an isometry of the lattice @xmath23 , and as one easily computes @xmath283 , we then get that @xmath284 . as @xmath285 is a plane section of @xmath272 ,",
    "the curve @xmath286 is a genus @xmath279 curve of degree @xmath278 in @xmath272 .",
    "hence @xmath0 is determinantal .    for the converse ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a general determinantal quartic surface in @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath0 is smooth ( @xcite ( 1.10 ) ) .",
    "let @xmath199 be the hyperplane class of @xmath0 , so @xmath287 .",
    "let @xmath288 be a degree @xmath278 and genus @xmath279 curve as in @xcite proposition 6.2 .",
    "then @xmath289 and the adjunction formula implies that @xmath290 .",
    "thus the intersection form on the sublattice @xmath291 of @xmath22 is given by the matrix @xmath292 this sublattice is isometric to @xmath23 since the @xmath31-basis of @xmath26 given by @xmath293 and @xmath294 gives this intersection matrix .",
    "thus @xmath22 of a determinantal quartic k3 surface contains @xmath23 as a sublattice and therefore the rank of @xmath22 is at least two . in the next section we provide an example of a ( smooth ) determinantal quartic with @xmath295 ,",
    "thus the same is true for the general determinantal quartic .",
    "for such a quartic we thus have @xmath296 , of finite index . as @xmath297 ,",
    "the index can only be @xmath104 or @xmath298 .",
    "if the index is two then @xmath299 with @xmath300 or @xmath301 or @xmath302 , but @xmath303 is odd in all these cases , so this is impossible .",
    "hence @xmath304 for a general determinantal quartic surface .",
    "the existence of a fixed point free automorphism of positive entropy now follows from oguiso s results in @xcite .",
    "the proposition implies in particular that a general smooth determinantal surface @xmath305 has nron severi group of rank two .",
    "one would thus like to see a curve on @xmath0 which is not a complete intersection , that is , whose class is not an integer multiple of the hyperplane class @xmath199 of @xmath305 . as explained in @xcite ( see also @xcite , example 4.2.4 ) , such curves , of genus 3 and degree 6 , can be found as follows .",
    "the matrix of linear forms @xmath65 , whose determinant defines @xmath0 , also gives a sheaf homomorphism @xmath306 on @xmath6 .",
    "the cokernel is @xmath307 for an invertible sheaf @xmath244 on @xmath0 , where @xmath308 is the inclusion ( @xcite , corollary 1.8 ) .",
    "@xmath309 so @xmath65 defines a line bundle on @xmath0 with sheaf of sections @xmath244 . we will denote this line bundle by @xmath244 as well .",
    "as @xmath310 for all @xmath311 , we obtain an isomorphism @xmath312 in proposition [ line ] we will show that @xmath244 has sections whose zero locus has degree @xmath278 and genus @xmath279 .",
    "we recall some well - known linear algebra . for an @xmath313 matrix @xmath314 , with coefficient @xmath315 in the @xmath311-th row and @xmath259-th column ,",
