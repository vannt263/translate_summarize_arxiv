    "thermal _ transport by spin excitations in low - dimensional quantum magnets has received significant attention due to very large heat conductivities found in a number of materials , for reviews see refs . , .",
    "one may speculate that thermal conductivity could be used to probe elementary excitations in quantum magnets in a fashion analogous to the use of electrical conductivity in metals .",
    "by now it is well established that integrable one - dimensional quantum magnets allow for infinite heat conductivity.@xcite experimentally , however , many spin systems rather remote from integrability also demonstrate large heat conductivities.@xcite understanding the role of coupling of the spin degrees of freedom to an environment , such as phonons and impurities , could be essential in this context .",
    "phonons are ubiquitous heat carriers along with spin excitations in all quantum magnets . usually , interaction between spins and phonons is discussed in the context of dissipation of their respective currents .",
    "significant progress has been made here,@xcite yet , many questions remain open .    in this work we focus on one such question which is rarely addressed : the off - diagonal effect of the flow of one of the excitations facilitating the flow of the other.@xcite it is referred to as `` spin - phonon drag '' , in analogy with electron - phonon drag discussed in the thermoelectric phenomena in metals and semiconductors@xcite .",
    "the second question we address in this work is the relation between two distinct theoretical approaches to transport in a generic coupled two - component system , namely the quasi - classical boltzmann transport theory and the kubo linear - response formalism .",
    "such relations , while of fundamental importance , remain unclear between many techniques@xcite devised in the past . for selected problems and techniques",
    "such correspondence has been established rather firmly,@xcite but , to the best of our knowledge , the comparison discussed in this work has not been performed previously .    historically , the term phonon drag appears in two rather distinct contexts .",
    "the first connotation is the negative effect of phonons on the electrical conductivity by slowing down electrons via processes that are different from the direct scattering effects.@xcite the second , also referred to as the gurevich effect,@xcite is responsible for the dramatic deviation of the thermopower in many materials from the predictions of the `` electron - only '' theory.@xcite in its idealized version,@xcite the phonon drag results in a substantial heat flow due to adjustment of the momentum distribution of phonons to that of the electrons , the latter being displaced by the electric field .    in this work ,",
    "the `` thermal - only '' analog of the gurevich effect for a generic spin - phonon problem is considered . in this case , only the thermal current is of interest . in the standard electron - phonon problem , the thermal - only drag is discarded traditionally . this is because the thermal conductivity by phonons in metals can usually be neglected due to strong scattering of phonons and the very large ratio of the fermi to sound velocity.@xcite however , this is not the case in several magnetic insulators of current interest @xcite where the magnetic and lattice heat conductivity can be of the same order .",
    "therefore , the drag between spin excitations and phonons can be an important phenomenon .",
    "we also note in passing , that in contrast the previous electron - phonon problems the dimensionality of the spin and the phonon system in magnetic insulators can be different .",
    "spin excitations may be confined to chains , ladders , and planes .",
    "thus , the focus of our study is on the general problem of a two - component system and the drag effect in the thermal conductivity .",
    "while the spin - phonon problem is our main motivation , we consider a generic model of bosonic quasiparticle - like excitations , e.g. magnons , coupled to phonons .",
    "we derive the contribution of the phonon drag to the thermal conductivity in the lowest order of the boson - phonon coupling using kubo and boltzmann formalisms .",
    "we demonstrate that both approaches yield _ identical _ results for the drag component of the thermal conductivity , thus establishing a direct correspondence between these methods .",
    "we note that despite a significant body of work on thermoelectric phenomena , to the best of our knowledge , such results have not been discussed before within these two approaches .",
    "while most of the work is devoted to bosonic spin excitations , we have also generalized our consideration to the case of fermionic excitations , as well as to the case of particle non - conserving boson - phonon interactions .",
    "the latter are as common as the `` normal '' , particle - conserving ones and occur , e.g. , in the phases with broken symmetry .",
    "we also note that using our expressions for the drag thermal conductivity we reproduce some of the results of the recent work,@xcite which considers spin - phonon drag in a particular class of quantum magnets using the memory - function approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ". appendix [ sec : analytic - continuation ] is devoted to the evaluation of the kubo diagrams for the drag using an alternative approach .",
    "finally , in appendix [ sec : nbc ] we discuss some corrections beyond the boltzmann results from the kubo diagrams .",
    "spin systems can yield a wide variety of excitations , such as spinons , magnons , triplet excitations , etc .",
    ", depending on the dimensionality , spin value , and geometry of the structural arrangement .",
    "because the focus of this work is on the drag between spin excitations and phonons , we assume that both of them are describable by well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "for the spin excitations we assume energy dispersion @xmath0 and some phenomenological intrinsic or extrinsic transport relaxation rate .",
    "this rate may include scattering caused by impurities , spin - spin interaction , and other degrees of freedom .",
    "the corresponding energy for phonons will be denoted by @xmath1 and they are also assumed to have a finite relaxation rate . in most of the paper ,",
    "we assume the statistics of the spin excitations to be that of bosons . sec .",
    "[ other ] outlines the changes in the drag conductivity which results if the choice of the statistics would be that of fermions .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling occurs because lattice displacements cause changes in the spin interactions and anisotropies.@xcite thus , the simplest , yet very general form of the spin - phonon coupling is _ linear _ in the lattice displacement and quadratic in the spin operators .",
    "after mapping spins onto bosonic quasiparticles , the resultant lowest - order boson - phonon coupling will generally contain the `` normal '' part , which conserves the boson number,@xcite and the off - diagonal , `` anomalous '' bosonic terms.@xcite since the subsequent drag conductivity derivation is conceptually identical for the normal and anomalous forms of interactions , we will postpone consideration of the latter until sec .",

    ". formally this case may raise questions regarding the transition into the disordered state , however is fully analogous to the textbook consideration of the lattice thermal conductivity at @xmath175.@xcite in fact . in this region quasiparticles can be considered as strongly damped .",
    "the rates of the umklapp scattering for spin excitations and phonons are high and are proportional to the occupation numbers of a `` typical '' boson or phonon , thus leading to @xmath176 . the rest of the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ kappatotal ] ) is again straightforward , giving @xmath177 .",
    "this should be compared to the diagonal conductivities in this regime , which show the same asymptotic behavior:@xcite @xmath178 .",
    "this consideration , combined with the low - temperature one , implies that the drag conductivity should go through a maximum at intermediate temperatures , similar to the diagonal conductivities .    when the energy scales of the phonon and spin system are well separated , as in the cuprate - based materials where @xmath179 , another asymptotic regime is possible , @xmath180 .",
    "intuitively , the drag can be expected to diminish together with the phonon conductivity ( @xmath181 ) because phonons are sufficiently equilibrated by the phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "however , the @xmath182-dependence of the drag also depends on the specifics of the relaxation within the spin system .",
    "thus , no definite conclusion on the prevalent behavior of the drag conductivity in this regime can be drawn without identifying such a relaxation .",
    "the disorder dependence of the drag can also be considered using similar qualitative reasoning .",
    "if the disorder affects both types of excitations on equal footing , so that @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the impurity concentration , then the drag conductivity diminishes as @xmath185 . if the disorder can be introduced selectively in one of the sub - systems without significantly affecting the other , as in the case of lattice disorder in the ladder cuprate system ca@xmath186la@xmath187cu@xmath188o@xmath189,@xcite the drag conductivity will be reduced together with the diagonal conductivity of the most affected species of excitations .    thus , intuitive conditions for maximizing the effect of drag are the simultaneous presence of significant population of spin excitations and phonons with long scattering times . since such conditions also imply large diagonal contributions of spins and phonons to the heat current , they are typically satisfied for temperatures that are low enough in comparison with either @xmath190 or @xmath191 but are above the boundary - limited regime .",
    "note that the optimal regime for the phonon drag in thermoelectric phenomenon is often quoted as @xmath192.@xcite such a regime can be of relevance to the recently reported record - breaking thermal conductivity by spin excitation in a high - purity 1d spin - chain material srcuo@xmath157 , ref .  , where a nearly ballistic propagation of spin excitations was reported .",
    "the issue of the separation of the drag component of the thermal conductivity from the `` diagonal '' one may require a series of doping experiments in which disorder is introduced deliberately to suppress the conductivity of one of the species and thus diminishing the drag as well.@xcite      lastly , we would like to come back to the problem of the gapless spin excitations with linear dispersion coupled to phonons , the problem motivated by the 1d spin - chain and 2d layered cuprates where the spin excitations are fast and the phonons are slow , @xmath179 .",
    "analogous to similar estimates of the thermoelectric power,@xcite and without reference to a specific model , the following consideration is not intended to be entirely rigorous , but rather is aimed at deriving an upper - limit estimate of the thermal gurevich effect .",
    "let us assume that the boson relaxation is due to impurities or some other extrinsic or intrinsic mechanism while phonons are dissipationless , a consideration similar to the electron - phonon drag problem.@xcite such a scenario is also potentially relevant to the 1d spin - chain materials in low-@xmath182 regime .",
    "then , the spin - phonon coupling will provide both the dissipation for phonons and the drag between phonons and spin excitations . in the drag conductivity , the phonon relaxation time ( @xmath193 ) enters together with the `` drag rates '' ( @xmath194 ) . as shown in appendix [ app_a].4",
    ", one can demonstrate that for quasiparticles with linear dispersions and for @xmath23-independent boson relaxation time @xmath195 the following simplification for the drag conductivity is possible for an _ arbitrary _ form of the coupling @xmath163 : @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the phonon and boson velocities , and @xmath199 is the phonon specific heat . since the diagonal conductivity of bosons in this case is @xmath200 , where @xmath161 is the dimensionality of the spin system , the ratio of the drag conductivity to the boson one is independent of the scatterings and is defined by the boson and phonon specific heats @xmath201 since the population of phonons at a given temperature can be much larger than that of bosons , the drag conductivity can significantly exceed the one by spin excitations .",
    "similar argument is at the core of the original proposal by gurevich for the large thermoelectric effect in metals,@xcite where the relation @xmath202 also implies the same drift velocities of phonons and electrons .    while the parallel and the similarity between the electron - phonon drag and the thermal - only drag considered in the last example are clear , they are not complete .",
    "the difference is in the presence of another diagonal conductivity term in our consideration , @xmath203 , which , in the limit of the small spin - phonon coupling will dominate both @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , in general , the relation ( [ ratio ] ) _ does not _ imply the equivalence of the drift velocities of phonons and spin excitations .",
    "in this work we have considered a two - component system of phonons and spin excitations and have obtained general expression for the off - diagonal contribution to its thermal conductivity in the lowest order of the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the off - diagonal contribution to the thermal current , referred to as thermal drag , is an enhancement of the heat flux of one of the species due to the flow of another and vice - versa .",
