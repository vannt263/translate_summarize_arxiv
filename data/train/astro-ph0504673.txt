    "2005 ) , has spectroscopically observed approximately 20,000 m and l dwarfs .",
    "these data have been used to examine magnetic activity ( west et al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter w04 ) , search for low mass subdwarfs ( w04 ) , and study the properties of white dwarf- m dwarf binary systems ( raymond et al .",
    "2003 ) with an unprecedented quantity of data .",
    "hawley et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter h02 ) first characterized a sample of the m , l and t dwarfs from the early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) of sdss . as a part of their study",
    ", they provided average colors for each spectral type and calculated both spectroscopic and photometric parallaxes as a function of spectral type and color respectively .",
    "many current studies are using low mass stars to probe the structure and composition of the galaxy ( west et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ; juric et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ; covey et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ; bochanski et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) and rely on the colors and photometric parallaxes provided by h02 .",
    "however , these colors , and therefore the photometric parallaxes , were based on the edr version of the sdss photometric pipeline .",
    "subsequent sdss data releases have utilized updated photometric software , resulting in rms changes of several hundredths of a magnitude compared to the edr photometry .",
    "the photometric pipelines for both data release 1 ( dr1 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) and data release 2 ( dr2 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2004 ) contain improved software that more rigorously calibrates the data and more accurately accounts for sky subtraction in the psf photometry .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline was frozen after dr2 ensuring that the dr3 photometry presented in this paper will not change due to sdss processing alterations .",
    "the latest sdss data releases have also dramatically increased the number of spectroscopically observed stars , allowing us to select a large sample of high signal - to - noise stars , a luxury not possible with the smaller edr dataset .",
    "our signal - to - noise cuts provide more accurate spectral types and photometry .",
    "this ability to make quality cuts on the data and still retain a large sample has substantially altered some of the colors reported in h02 . in this paper",
    ", we report an updated set of low mass star colors from a high signal - to - noise subset of the w04 sample , and derive new photometric parallax relations using the updated photometry of the h02 sample .    in order to aid in the analysis of magnetic activity in w04",
    ", a new technique was designed by walkowicz , hawley & west ( 2004 ; hereafter whw ) for calculating the ratio of the luminosity in h@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "whw determined a @xmath3 factor , that when multiplied by the h@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) , gives the value of @xmath1/@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 factor varies with spectral type and whw used the low mass star colors reported in h02 to derive @xmath3 as a function of color . here",
    "we present new equations for determining @xmath3 , based on our updated photometry .    .",
    "error bars are the spreads reported in h02 .",
    "discrepancies in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors are likely due to our large sample size and high signal - to - noise quality cut . because the @xmath6 and @xmath7 colors are from the _ same _ stars as used by h02 , the color differences in these bands indicate changes in the sdss photometric pipeline . ]",
    "all of the sdss photometry reported in this study has been reduced using the dr3 version of the sdss photometric pipeline ( photo 5_4_25 ) .",
    "our main sample of low mass stars comes from the w04 spectroscopic sample .",
    "the stars were selected from the sdss database based on their @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors ( see w04 for a detailed description ) , and have been spectral - typed using template fitting and molecular band indices as described in h02 .",
    "all spectral types were confirmed by manual inspection . for this study , we have selected stars from each spectral type bin with photometric errors less than 0.05 magnitudes in @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for m dwarfs and less than 0.05 magnitudes in @xmath9 and @xmath10 for l dwarfs .",
    "we have also downloaded the dr3 photometry for the stars from the h02 study in order to recalibrate the photometric parallax measurements in the manner of h02 .",
    "the same quality cuts on photometric errors that are discussed above have been applied to these data .",
    "we adopt the 2mass @xmath11 magnitudes and the spectroscopic parallax relations from h02 .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute @xmath12 magnitudes from that paper are @xmath13 0.5 magnitudes .",

    "the error bars are the spreads given by h02 .",

    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors that we measure for stars with spectral types m0 , m6 and m7 have significant differences from those of h02 .",
    "these offsets are due to our larger sample size , and our use of only high signal - to - noise sdss data .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 data come from the same stars used by h02 , but the edr photometry has been replaced by that of dr3 .",
    "although some of the difference comes from our data quality cut , much of the offset can be attributed to changes in sdss photometry .    using the mean colors ,",
    "we derive new photometric parallax relations for the @xmath5 and @xmath7 colors by plotting the absolute @xmath9-band magnitude as a function of color .",
    "we fit the @xmath16 vs. @xmath5 relation with a 3 part linear piece - wise function , which is a better description of this relation than a polynomial fit .",
    "spectral types later than l0 are not included because of the similar @xmath5 colors for stars cooler than l0 .",

    "these results agree within the uncertainties with the relations derived by williams et al .",

    "individual stars have been binned according to their spectral types .",
    "very few stars with spectral classes later than m6 exist in these samples .",
    "therefore , the late type stars have been binned every 2 spectral types ( m7-m8 and m9-l0 ) .",

    "the @xmath5 color derived from this relation has an uncertainty in the fit of 0.10 magnitudes while the @xmath4 color has an uncertainty of 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "the uncertainty of 0.05 magnitudes is small enough that photometric errors most likely dominate the error budget for the @xmath4 vs. @xmath19 relation , rather than the uncertainty in the fit .    using the @xmath3 values and johnson - cousins/2mass colors for each star as given in whw , we apply equations 3 and 4 to transform the colors of the whw stars to the sdss system",
    ". fits to @xmath14 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 are presented in figure [ fig5 ] and described by the equations :    @xmath25    over the ranges 0.67 @xmath18 @xmath4 @xmath18 2.01 and 0.37 @xmath18 @xmath5 @xmath18 1.84 .",
    "the uncertainty in the fit for @xmath14 is 0.22 for both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath4 relation _ should not _ be used for spectral types later than m6 , as the reddest points in figure [ fig5 ] show significant systematic deviations from the mean relation .",
    "using sdss dr3 photometry and the low mass star samples of w04 , h02 and whw , we calculate updated average colors for low - mass stars and derive new photometric parallax relations .",
    "we stress that the intrinsic scatter in the colors of m and l dwarfs is large and any distances determined from photometric parallaxes carry significant uncertainties . with our updated colors , we also provide new color transformations between @xmath4 and @xmath19 and between @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "equations for calculating @xmath3 ( see whw ) are provided to aid in studying the magnetic activity in cool stars .",
    "again we warn the reader to pay careful attention to the propagation of uncertainties and the boundaries in color space over which our relations are relevant when using these results .",
    "these data will allow for more accurate studies of the distribution of low mass stars in the galaxy . with the bountiful sdss data",
