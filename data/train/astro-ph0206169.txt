    "evolutionary synthesis models have been traditionally used to study the physical properties of unresolved populations , but they should also be able to reproduce the integrated properties of resolved ones . in both cases the discreteness of the stellar populations must be taken into account and model results must be interpreted in a statistical way , i.e. model outputs are a _",

    "intrinsic dispersion_. such dispersion must be taken into account in the interpretation of the data and it is especially important when the number of observed stars is small ( where the definition of `` small '' depends on the observable ) , or in the analysis of surveys .    especially relevant is the use of diagnostic diagrams , that are , virtually , independent on the mass / number of stars in the system .",
    "i show in fig 1 the 90% confidence limits ( cl ) for the ew(wr bump ) and l(wr bump)/l(h@xmath0 ) ratios vs. ew(h@xmath0 ) for different amount of mass transformed into stars for evolutionary tracks with standard mass - loss rates and different metallicities .",
    "the plots show the 90% cl in the results arising from the dispersion in _ both axes _ and the correlation coefficients between them ; the ( gaussian ) covariance ellipses correspond to an effective number of stars larger than 10 , @xmath1 , and the rectangular boxes delimit the uncertainty region for @xmath2 ."
