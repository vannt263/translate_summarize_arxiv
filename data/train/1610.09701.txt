    "the dynamics of incompressible fluids , while an old and active subject , is still very elusive due to the possibility of rapid small - scale creation as well as the inherent non - locality of incompressible fluid motion . since",
    "the work of euler , who wrote down the partial differential equations which model the flow of an ideal fluid , a number of works have been devoted to proving existence , uniqueness , and stability results but only recently did authors start to work on the notion of `` criticality '' in the study of ideal fluids .",
    "critical spaces are those function spaces which are small enough to allow for an existence and uniqueness theory but large enough to allow for the presence of certain fine scale structures ( jump discontinuities or corners , for example ) .",
    "while it may seem that solvability in critical spaces is simply a `` philosophical '' question of how irregular one can take the initial data to be and still solve the given pde uniquely , working in critical spaces allows one to get to the heart of what s going on in the pde , as we shall soon see in the examples of the 2d euler equation and the surface quasi - geostrophic equation . in critical spaces",
    ", one can actually study the evolution of special structures which may satisfy a much simpler dynamic than the full problem .",
    "in particular , since we are working in a `` critical space '' and since criticality is related to a notion of scaling , the dynamic of these special structures may actually be governed by `` scale - invariant '' solutions . furthermore",
    ", the dynamic of these scale - invariant solutions , such as whether they collapse in finite time , will turn out to have a direct bearing on regularity questions .",
    "this is the basic philosophy of this work and we will illustrate it through two examples : the 2d euler equation and the surface quasi - geostophic equation .",
    "in fact , in a companion work , we will also discuss the 3d euler equation , but we elected to give it its own place due to the importance of the questions associated with the 3d euler equation .",
    "we begin by introducing the 2d euler equation and some of the works which have been done in critical spaces .",
    "consider the cauchy problem for the 2d euler equations on the whole plane .",
    "that is , given a divergence - free initial data @xmath10 , we look for solutions of @xmath11 classically , it is well known that if the initial data @xmath12 is regular enough , then one can solve uniquely .",
    "this can be done , locally in time , by energy methods . more concretely ,",
    "if @xmath12 belongs to either @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the dimension of the domain ) or @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , then , there is a unique solution in the class @xmath19;h^s)$ ] or @xmath19;c^{k,\\alpha})$ ] , for some @xmath20 . a key step in showing such a well - posedness result is to obtain an appropriate _ a priori _ estimate , which in this case takes the form @xmath21 applied with the embeddings @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "one sees from this that the lipschitz norm of the velocity actually propagates higher regularity in time . on the other hand",
    ", the lipschitz bound allows one to solve uniquely the following ode system @xmath24 for each @xmath25 in the domain .",
    "then for each fixed @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a diffeomorphism of the domain , called the flow map .",
    "it is useful to define the vorticity of the fluid , @xmath28 .",
    "the following logarithmic estimates are available for smooth solutions : @xmath29 and combined with the standard estimates above , one obtains the criteria of beale , kato , and majda @xcite that as long as we keep @xmath30 in control , the solution of remains smooth .",
    "this is actually automatic in the case of two dimensions ; the vorticity equals a scalar @xmath31 , and taking the curl of , one obtains the vorticity equation ; @xmath32 note that the vorticity is simply being transported by the flow : we have @xmath33 and hence the maximum of the vorticity is a conserved quantity . in the case of the whole plane , when @xmath34 has some decay at infinity ( @xmath35 would suffice ) , it is well - known that the following biot - savart law @xmath36 uniquely recovers the velocity which decays at infinity , and the set of equations , , and gives a formulation of the @xmath37 euler equations , which does not involve differentiation .",
    "now , a bound on @xmath38 only gives that @xmath39 is quasi - lipschitz .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath40 yudovich @xcite showed that for all @xmath41 @xmath42 for some universal constant @xmath43 this allows us to solve the ode uniquely .",
    "these considerations lead to an existence and uniqueness theory for @xmath44 vorticities which was first established by yudovich in 1963 @xcite .",
    "this extension of the well - posedness theory over the classical results is a significant one ; for instance , the class @xmath44 contains patch - type vorticity ( e.g. the characteristic function of a measurable set ) , which models certain physical situations .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath45 bound on @xmath34 does not necessarily lead to lipschitz control on the velocity field can be problematic since a non - lipschitz velocity field can lead to a flow map @xmath27 which loses its regularity in time .",
    "since @xmath46 a bound on the lipschitz norm of @xmath39 is crucial to propagate fine - scale structures which may be present in the initial data .",
    "unfortunately , as has been established in the works of the first author and masmoudi @xcite as well as in the work of bourgain and li @xcite , propagating a bound on the lipschitz norm of @xmath39 is , in general , not possible if @xmath12 is only assumed to be lipschitz continuous . in order to actually propagate a lipschitz bound on @xmath39",
    ", the initial data must be taken to be smoother than just lipschitz .",
    "as noted above , @xmath47 or @xmath48 with @xmath49 would do , but one can also propagate lipschitz bounds on @xmath39 using anisotropic regularity such as is the case with smooth vortex patches ( see @xcite ) . propagating the lipschitz bound on @xmath39 for solutions which have corner like discontinuities",
    "was left open in previous works and will be returned to later on in this work ( see the subsection on the propagation of angular regularity ) .      the usual assumption that @xmath50 may be argued physically unsatisfactory , since the vorticity and the velocity have to decay at infinity .",
    "indeed , the well - posedness of the euler equations with merely bounded velocity and vorticity has been achieved in the works of serfati @xcite , and they have been further expanded and generalized in @xcite . the main result states that ( see @xcite for details ) given a pair of bounded functions @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and an arbitrary continuous function @xmath54 satisfying @xmath55 , there is a unique global - in - time solution to the 2d euler equations where for each time , @xmath56 are bounded functions and satisfies the `` renormalized biot - savart law '' @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the biot - savart kernel in and @xmath59 is some cutoff whose support increases to infinity with @xmath60 . here ,",
    "the `` behavior at infinity '' @xmath61 can be removed with the following change of variables @xmath62 with @xmath63 just in @xmath45 , the biot - savart law clearly does not converge .",
    "the key observation of serfati was that , using the euler equations and integration by parts , for smooth solutions one has the following serfati identity : @xmath64 \\right ) * ( u\\otimes",
    "u ) ( s ) ds~ ,      \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 being some compactly supported cut - off function , and surprisingly the last expression makes sense with @xmath66 , since @xmath67 $ ] has decay @xmath68 , which is integrable .",
    "the identities and are indeed equivalent , see @xcite . in this paper , we keep the assumption @xmath69 but replace the assumption @xmath70 with @xmath34 being @xmath0-fold rotationally symmetric around the origin , for some integer @xmath1 .",
    "our main result shows that one can uniquely solve the 2d euler equation in this symmetry class .",
    "somewhat analogously to the serfati case , the key fact we utilize is that under the symmetry assumption , the biot - savart kernel actually gains integrable decay at infinity ( this fact was obtained in a very recent work of the first author @xcite ) , which in particular enables us to recover the velocity from the vorticity . indeed , using the symmetry of @xmath34 , one may rewrite @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the counterclockwise rotation matrix by the angle @xmath73 , and the point is that @xmath74 in the regime @xmath75 .",
    "this is integrable for @xmath1 , and barely fails to be so for @xmath76 . in this situation ,",
    "the origin is a fixed point for all time , and the velocity and stream function have bounds @xmath77 which are natural in view of physical dimensions .",
    "this in particular removes the non - uniqueness issue arising from @xmath61 in the serfati case .",
    "more importantly , it says that the logarithmic correction @xmath78 ( which we usually expect ) is absent at the origin , and this is a key ingredient in our proof .",
    "in fact , as we will show , the symmetry condition actually allows us to propagate global lipschitz bounds on @xmath39 even though @xmath34 may have a `` corner '' jump discontinuity at the origin which , without the symmetry , was shown to lead to unbounded lipschitz norm in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the symmetry condition gives that for @xmath79 which is lipschitz , its gradient can grow at most exponentially at the origin .",
    "this type of result was recently established by itoh , miura , and yoneda @xcite , which we discuss after giving the proof of our main result .",
    "a natural question is whether one can actually prove bounds on the lipschitz norm of @xmath39 even if @xmath34 has a non - smooth jump discontinuity at the origin .",
    "in fact , one of the basic themes of this paper is to study the question of whether @xmath45 estimates can be established for singular integrals without extra regularity assumptions in the sense of scaling using only symmetry conditions . to this end",
    ", we define a scale of spaces @xmath81 by : @xmath82 these spaces have the same scaling as @xmath45 but , under a symmetry condition , we prove boundedness of the singular integrals arising from the operator which sends @xmath34 to @xmath80 via the biot - savart law and more general problems . we prove :",
    "let @xmath83 be @xmath3fold symmetric for some @xmath4 .",
    "then , @xmath84    there exists @xmath83 with compact support and which is 2-fold symmetric for which @xmath85    these bounds are crucial to prove existence and uniqueness for the sqg equation in a class of merely lipschitz continuous initial data and allow us to propagate lipschitz bounds on the velocity field in the 2d euler equation even when the initial velocity field has a jump discontinuity .",
    "in fact , one can prove the following theorem :    let @xmath86 be @xmath3fold symmetric for some @xmath87 then there exists a unique global solution to the 2d euler equation with initial data @xmath79 belonging to @xmath81 for all @xmath88 moreover , @xmath89 remains bounded for all finite times .",
    "this extension to the yudovich theory contains some interesting classes of solutions .",
    "a distinguished class is the case of bounded and radially homogeneous vorticity , i.e. @xmath34 satisfying @xmath90 .",
    "homogeneity is propagated by the euler dynamics , and , by uniqueness , the system reduces to a simple but nontrivial 1d equation on the unit circle . in particular",
    ", @xmath91 satisfies the following 1d active scalar equation :    @xmath92 @xmath93 this 1d system is even more regular than the 2d euler equations , in the sense that the advecting velocity field is two derivatives more regular than the advected quantity . as a result , @xmath94 can grow at most exponentially in time , in contrast with the double exponential rate for the case of 2d euler .",
    "we show that this exponential rate is sharp when we have a boundary available , and rule it out in the absence of boundaries , under some extra assumptions .",
    "these are shown via establishing that there is a trend to equilibrium as time goes to infinity .",
    "we note that these solutions , while being infinite energy , can be placed into a natural uniqueness class , which is the class of bounded vorticities satisfying the symmetry assumption . as a consequence",
    ", they can also be used to show that solutions with finite energy experience growth of angular derivatives as @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , using our analysis of the 1d model , we can prove that there exist solutions to the 2d euler equation with lipschitz velocity field and which are smooth in the angular variable for all times for which the angular derivative of @xmath96 @xmath97 experience ( at least ) linear - in - time @xmath45 growth .",
    "when a boundary is present , this growth can actually be ( at least ) exponential in time .",
    "this follows simply from analyzing the behavior of the 1d system .",
    "hence , we emphasize , while the solutions of the 1d system are infinite energy , any growth of @xmath94 implies the existence of compact support @xmath34 with @xmath97 growing at least as fast .",
    "the consideration of radially homogenous vorticity is comparable to the well - known _ stagnation - point similitude _ ansatz , which in the case of 2d takes the form @xmath98 ( note that @xmath39 satisfies the divergence free condition ) , and when inserted in the 2d euler equation , one obtains the so - called proudman - johnson equation @xcite @xmath99 to the best of our knowledge , in the context of the euler equations , was first studied by stuart @xcite who showed formation of singularities in finite - time .",
    "this is one of the unfortunate sides of the ansatz because clearly the fact that these solutions form singularities in finite time has no bearing on singularity formation in the 2d euler equation ( since singularities _ can not _ form in finite time for the 2d euler equation ) . in this sense ,",
    "the singularity is `` coming from infinity '' and is a consequence of the solution being of infinite energy .",
    "the ansatz can be inserted in many other nonlinear evolution equations to define a 1d system .",
    "for an example , inserting it to the sqg ( surface quasi - geostrophic ) equation @xcite , one obtains a particular case of the de gregorio model ( discussed in section [ sec : sqg ] ) .",
    "see also a recent work of sarria and wu @xcite where they study the 2d boussinesq model with .",
    "in higher dimensions , one can similarly put @xmath100 this was suggested in gibbon , fokas , and doering @xcite in the context of the 3d euler equations , and was shown to blow - up in finite time in the papers of childress , ierley , spiegel , and young @xcite and constantin @xcite .",
    "notice that in all these cases , the vorticity is never a bounded function ; indeed , from , one sees that @xmath101 grows linearly in space .",
    "our radial homogeneity ansatz is special in this regard , and it seems that having bounded vorticity is the key to having _",
    "uniqueness_.      above , we discussed how , while working in the critical spaces @xmath81 and under a symmetry condition , one can derive information about finite - energy solutions from information about the dynamic of scale - invariant solutions .",
    "we now explain how this can also be done for the sqg equation .",
    "recall the 2d surface quasi - geostrophic equation : @xmath102 this system bears great resemblance to the 2d euler equation except that the biot - savart law ( the relation between @xmath103 and @xmath39 ) is more singular than in the euler case . while in the 2d euler equation ,",
    "the vorticity is one derivative better than @xmath96 here @xmath103 and @xmath39 are at the same level of regularity . for this reason ,",
    "the global regularity problem for the sqg equation is still open . indeed , to prove regularity for the sqg equation , one would basically need an @xmath45 bound on @xmath80 , just as in the euler equation , but this time bounds on the @xmath45 norm of @xmath80 are very far from the obvious conservation laws in the equation@xmath104 conservation of @xmath103 which only leads to @xmath104 bounds on @xmath105 as a way to approach this problem",
    ", one may first try to prove local well - posedness for the sqg equation in the critical space of lipschitz @xmath103 .",
    "unfortunately , this seems to be impossible to do directly due to the presence of singular integrals in the map from @xmath106 to @xmath80 .",
    "one can actually show that the sqg at least `` mildly ill - posed '' in the lipschitz class in the sense given in @xcite .",
    "however , using our intuition from the euler case , one could hope to establish local well - posedness in a critical space which includes `` scale - invariant '' solutions , then derive the equation for scale - invariant solutions and study its properties , and finally deduce some growth mechanism , like finite - time singularity formation for the sqg system with finite energy .",
    "what we will show here is that local well - posedness can indeed be established and a 1d model is derived we then prove a conditional result : if singularities form in finite time for the 1d model , then there exists data with compact support in the local well - posedness class ( a subset of the class of lipschitz functions ) whose unique solution breaks down in finite time .",
    "an interesting open problem is now to establish whether the 1d model breaks down in finite time .",
    "the following theorem sums up the discussion above :    for @xmath18 let @xmath107 be the class of functions @xmath108 for which :    1",
    ".   @xmath109 , 2 .",
    "@xmath110 is @xmath3fold rotationally symmetric and odd with respect to an axis .",
    "then , for every @xmath111 there exists @xmath112 depending only on @xmath113 and a unique solution to the inviscid sqg equation , @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 moreover , there is a one - dimensional evolution equation on @xmath117 , which we call the 1d sqg equation , singularity formation for smooth enough solutions in which implies the existence of @xmath118 which has compact support in space for which the solution of the sqg equation , @xmath119 , with @xmath120 as initial data satisfies that @xmath121 becomes infinite in finite time .",
    "the structure of the rest of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : eu ] is devoted to the analysis of the 2d euler equation : we begin with providing some simple and explicit solutions covered by our analysis",
    ". then we proceed to prove our first main result , which is the global existence and uniqueness of the solution with bounded and @xmath0-fold rotationally symmetric vorticity .",
    "after that we establish global existence in the critical spaces @xmath122 .",
    "we conclude the section with some general bounds in these spaces , which will be useful in the following sections .",
    "then , in section [ sec : homog ] , we study the special case of radially homogeneous solutions to the 2d euler equation .",
    "this consideration gives a 1d active scalar equation , and we establish some basic properties of the model .",
    "in particular , we show that upon a few simple assumptions on the initial data , its solution converges to an equilibrium state .",
    "moreover , by considering measure valued vorticities , we obtain existence of time periodic and quasi - periodic solutions to 2d euler .",
    "in section [ sec : sqg ] we study the sqg equation .",
    "we establish a local well - posedness in the critical spaces , which contains the class of radially homogeneous solutions described by a 1d model .",

    "let us state the main result of this section .",
    "assume that the initial vorticity @xmath79 is just bounded and @xmath0-fold rotationally symmetric with some @xmath1 .",

    "one may proceed as in the proof of theorem [ thm : smooth_away_from_0 ] using the flow maps .",

    "some further examples will be provided in section [ sec : homog ] .    radial and stationary solutions in 2d are widely known , see for instance the book of bertozzi and majda ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "2 ) . take some vorticity function which depends only on the radius ; i.e. @xmath134 for some @xmath110 smooth and compactly supported .",

    "one may consider the limiting case when @xmath140 : our result implies that , @xmath141 on @xmath142 is the _",

    ", consider the following vorticity configuration ( in polar coordinates ) : @xmath146 these solutions are stationary for any @xmath145 ; indeed , the euler equation preserve odd symmetry of the vorticity along a line , and for each line of discontinuity of @xmath147 , it is odd so that the fluid particles can not cross such a line .",
    "now we take the limit @xmath140 : our main result implies that , for @xmath1 , the stationary one is the _",
    "unique _ solution to the euler equation .    in the special case @xmath76",
    ", these solutions for finite @xmath60 are often called the bahouri - chemin solutions @xcite , and the limit @xmath140 is not covered by our analysis .",
    "it serves as an explicit counterexample for us , as the associated velocity vector field near the origin satisfies @xmath148 ( see also ) .",
    "actually , in @xcite we utilized a suitably smoothed - out version of the bahouri - chemin solution to recover ill - posedness of the 2d euler equation in sobolev spaces scale as @xmath30 , a fact established first by bourgain and li @xcite .",
    "our main result confirms that , in a sense , the bahouri - chemin scenario is the `` only option '' for showing such an ill - posedness result , at least near the origin .",

    "there can not exist a limiting solution .    in an interesting recent work @xcite",
    ", the authors have successfully classified all stationary solutions to the 2d euler equation , which has the form @xmath151 for some @xmath152 , and with some regularity assumption on @xmath153 .",
    "the above stationary solutions correspond to the case @xmath154 but they have escaped the classification in @xcite ; our understanding is that the authors work under the situation where @xmath155 on the unit circle ( which is natural to do in their framework ) , while our solutions only satisfy @xmath156 .    taking any linear combination of the above two examples , we get another class of interesting solutions , which simply rotates around the origin with constant angular speed .    for @xmath157 , take any two constants @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and define using polar coordinates @xmath160 on @xmath142 .",

    ", it is an easy matter to show that the particle trajectories of these yudovich solutions converge to those of ours in the limit @xmath168 uniformly on compact sets .",

    "the existence is then easily shown thanks to the biot - savart formula .",
    "once this is done , we have a well - defined vorticity formulation of the 2d euler equation , and we first show uniqueness , using the osgood type uniqueness for odes . then the existence can be actually shown along the similar lines .",
    "these arguments are indeed an adaptation of an elegant proof of the yudovich theorem given in the book ( * ? ? ?",

    "as can be expected , it is possible to prove local well - posedness for bounded vorticities even in the 3d case under a suitable symmetry condition using the @xmath81 spaces we defined above .",
    "this case will be discussed in a forthcoming work @xcite .          in the past few years",

    "indeed , a v - state is defined to be a vortex patch solution to the 2d euler equation where the vortex patch simply rotates for all time .",
    "the general method for proving existence of such v - states , starting with the work of burbea @xcite , is to bifurcate from the base v - state , @xmath860 which is the characteristic function of @xmath861 , which is a stationary solution of the 2d euler equation .",
    "these bifurcation solutions have been shown to be smooth or even analytic in some cases .",
    "hmidi , mateau and verdera @xcite , for example , proved that if a v - state is close in the @xmath862 norm to the disk , then it actually has smooth boundary . in this paper",
    ", we proved the existence of v - states with corners whose support is unbounded .",
    "moreover , it can easily be checked that these  unbounded \" v - states with corners actually lead to v - states with corners when the problem is posed on the unit disk @xcite .",
    "what all this means is that v - states with corners _ do _ exist when the domain is just the unit disk or when the v - states are allowed to be unbounded .",
    "a natural question then arises : can one  cut - off \" the unbounded v - states constructed in this paper to construct bounded v - states which are smooth except at the origin where there is a corner ?",
    "above , we constructed vortex sheets emanating from the origin which exhibit pendulum - like motion which is quasi - periodic in time .",
    "it is not even clear whether there exist vortex patches with quasi - periodic behavior of the type we constructed in this paper ( which are constant along lines emanating from the origin ) .",
