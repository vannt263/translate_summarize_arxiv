    "in this article we present a study of semileptonic decay of the @xmath20 meson into @xmath21 and also to @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 meson , a scalar , though well established experimentally , has a relatively uncertain mass and width @xcite ; in addition there have been claims that the quark content may be a mixture of a traditional quark - antiquark with a four - quark system @xcite .",
    "semileptonic @xmath20 decays provide a pristine environment where the @xmath13 is produced by an isoscalar combination of @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks .",
    "evidence for @xmath23 in semileptonic decays was seen by babar via the @xmath26 channel , where interference was observed by an s - wave with the dominant p - wave @xmath27 decay @xcite .",
    "the first measurement of the @xmath28 , @xmath29 product branching fraction was recently made by cleo @xcite . the semileptonic decay diagram is shown in fig .  [ dssemi ] .",
    "here we investigate this mode using a data sample of 600 pb@xmath30 , approximately double the original size .",
    "this larger sample is sufficient to allow us to determine the @xmath13 mass and width and measure the semileptonic decay form factor as a function of the invariant four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath4 , between the @xmath31 and the @xmath13 .",
    "decay into a @xmath27 or @xmath23 meson.,width=279 ]    cp violation measurements in the @xmath9 system have concentrated on the final state @xmath32 , with @xmath33 . for a review see ref .  @xcite . since",
    "this mode is not a cp eigenstate an angular analysis is required to separate the cp even and cp odd parts , and measure the cp violating phase @xmath34 .",
    "in what follows we will use a simple notation for the decay width of a particle multiplied by the branching fraction for the decay of one of its daughters .",
    "for example , @xmath35    stone and zhang @xcite have suggested that the @xmath32 mode may also contain an s - wave @xmath36 system at the @xmath27 mass with a rate that could be as large as @xmath375% that of the @xmath27 . this s - wave ,",
    "if it should be significant , would require additional parameters in the fit to extract @xmath34 .",
    "they also suggest that the final state @xmath8 may be a useful alternative ; since it is a cp - eigenstate angular analysis is not required .",
    "stone and zhang estimated the branching ratio @xmath38 assuming equality of the ratios @xmath39 the phase spaces for the @xmath40 and @xmath20 decays are quite similar , but the spin structure is not . in these",
    "@xmath20 decays both the @xmath27 and the @xmath13 are produced opposite a spin-0 pion , rather than a spin-1 @xmath41 .",
    "this consideration prompted stone and zhang to suggest that measuring the ratio of decay widths of semileptonic @xmath20 decays containing either an @xmath13 or a @xmath27 at four - momentum transfers , @xmath4 , equal to zero would give a superior prediction @xcite .",
    "specifically they propose that @xmath42 the point @xmath4 equal to zero is chosen to maximize the allowed phase space in order to make it as close as possible to that available in @xmath43 ( or @xmath13 ) decay . in this paper",
    "we will present measurements of this ratio , the form factor in the @xmath44 channel , the @xmath13 mass and width , and update the previously published cleo branching fractions for these two semileptonic decay modes @xcite .",
    "the cleo - c detector @xcite is equipped to measure the momenta and directions of charged particles , identify them using specific ionization ( @xmath45 ) and cherenkov light ( rich ) @xcite , detect photons and determine their directions and energies .",
    "in this study we use 600 pb@xmath30 of data produced in @xmath46 collisions using the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and recorded near a center - of - mass energy ( @xmath47 ) of 4.170 gev . at this energy the @xmath46 annihilation cross - section into @xmath48 plus @xmath1 is approximately 1  nb @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we fully reconstruct a sample of @xmath49 in several ",
    "tag \" modes and then find candidate semileptonic decays in this sample .",
    "mention of any specific decay implies the use of its charge - conjugate as well .",
    "the tag selection is identical to that used in our @xmath50 paper , that can be consulted for details @xcite .",
    "briefly , we select candidates on the basis of their beam - constrained invariant mass",
    ". then we detect an additional photon candidate from the @xmath51 decay , and construct the missing mass squared , mm@xmath52 recoiling against the photon and the @xmath49 tag @xmath53 where @xmath47 ( @xmath54 ) is the center - of - mass energy ( momentum ) , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the energy ( momentum ) of the fully reconstructed @xmath49 tag , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the energy ( momentum ) of the additional photon . in performing this calculation",
    "we use a kinematic fit that constrains the decay products of the @xmath49 to the known @xmath31 mass and conserves overall momentum and energy .",
    "all photon candidates in the event are used , except for those that are decay products of the @xmath49 tag candidate . regardless of whether or not the photon forms a @xmath59 with the tag , for real @xmath60 events",
    "mm@xmath52 should peak at the @xmath61 mass - squared .",
    "we list the number of signal events in each mode in table  [ tab : ntags ] by finding the number of events within @xmath617.5 mev of the @xmath31 mass .",
    "for ease of further analysis we sum all tag modes together , as shown in fig .",

    "in one class of models , the @xmath23 is thought to be a @xmath66 state described in the quark model as composed of quark - antiquark states which form a mixture of strange and non - strange components characterized by a mixing angle @xmath67 defined in terms of the wave - function as described by aliev and savci @xcite @xmath68    since the central value of the mass is below threshold for decay into a kaon pair , the branching ratio to physical @xmath69 states is suppressed .",
    "bes has extracted relative branching ratios using @xmath70 decays where the @xmath71 , and either both @xmath23 s decay into @xmath72 or one into @xmath72 and the other into @xmath36 @xcite . from their results",
    "we obtain @xmath73    assuming that the @xmath74 and @xmath75 decays are dominant we can also extract @xmath76 where we have assumed that the only other decays are to @xmath77 , 1/2 of the @xmath72 rate , and to neutral kaons , equal to charged kaons .",
    "this approach has been used by b. el - bennich _ et al . _",
    "it is possible , however , that the decays @xmath78 or @xmath79 are significant .",
    "if so , then the branching fraction of @xmath13 into two pions will be smaller ,    using the above branching fraction we extract @xmath80 , where the error on the @xmath29 rate has been included in the systematic error , and , in fact , is the dominant contribution",
    ".    we can use this rate to estimate the mixing angle @xmath81 .",
    "aliev and savci using qcd sum rules predict that @xmath82 .",
    "this provides us with a value of @xmath83 where we have truncated the positive uncertainly so that the value does not exceed unity .",
    "this determination gives a somewhat larger but consistent evaluation with other methods @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath13 decay rate into four pions is significant , our value of the mixing angle will be somewhat larger .",
    "the near unity value for @xmath84 poses a conundrum : if the @xmath13 is dominantly an @xmath19 state , why does it decay predominantly into @xmath74 ?",
    "a solution may be that the quark content of the @xmath13 is not composed of just a quark - antiquark state , but may contain a some four - quark content @xcite .",
    "we now return to the determination of the @xmath13 mass and width . in the fit described above we used a relativistic breit - wigner function .",
    "we did not , however , take into account that the phase space for the larger @xmath13 masses is somewhat smaller , due to the finite @xmath31 mass , than for smaller @xmath13 masses .",
    "the changes to the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath13 have been parameterized by dosch _",
    "et al . _",
    "the double differential decay rate in terms of @xmath85 is @xmath86 where @xmath87 and is equal to @xmath88 times the square of the momentum of the @xmath13 in the @xmath31 rest frame , and @xmath89 is the relativistic breit - wigner shape given in equations  [ eq : relbw ] and [ eq : relbw2 ] .",
    "the resulting , slightly shifted mass spectrum , then is given by integrating the above expression over @xmath4 @xmath90    we perform this integral using our fitted form factor shape for @xmath10 and our original fitted parameters for the relativistic breit - wigner function .",
    "this generates a new shape for the mass spectrum , that we fit to the data . in principle",
    "this procedure can be iterated many times ; here we find that only one iteration is sufficient .",
    "the resulting curve fitted to the data is shown in fig .",
    "[ f0mm_new ] .",
    "the systematic errors on the mass are small compared to the statistical error .",
    "the masses of known particles , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath27 , @xmath93 are reproduced in other cleo analyses to better than 1 mev .",
    "changing the background level by @xmath61 standard deviation changes the mass by a negligible amount .",
    "for the width we have identified two sources of systematic error , one the resonance shape and the other the form factor shape . changing the breit - wigner shape from relativistic to non - relativistic causes a change of @xmath62 mev .",
    "we also vary the form factor by @xmath6 one standard deviation resulting in a change of about @xmath62 mev .",
    "our final values for the mass and width are @xmath94 we do not fit our data to a function that allows for the opening of a threshold in another channel , because there is no obvious change in the shape of the dipion mass spectrum near 1 gev , and we do not have enough data to specify the parameters of such a fit .",
    "0.00 cm    = 6.0 in",
    "we present an updated result for the first measurement of @xmath95 assuming a simple pole model for the form factor , @xmath10 , we estimate the pole mass as ( @xmath12 ) gev .    in the final state",
    "the only hadron present is the @xmath13 .",
    "this provides a particulary clean environment that allows us to measure the mass and width as @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we update our measurement of @xmath96    we measure the ratio of decay rates at @xmath97 @xmath98 this ratio has been predicted by stone and zhang to equal @xcite @xmath99 our measurement indicates that the @xmath38 channel may indeed be a useful place to measure cp violation in the @xmath9 system in that the rate can be @xmath10040% that for @xmath101 mode , especially since an angular analysis is not necessary , as the @xmath8 mode is a cp eigenstate .    finally , we show that viewing the @xmath13 as a quark - antiquark state results in a mixing angle between @xmath102 and light quarks whose cosine is close to unity , consistent with other estimates @xcite",
    ". thus , the large rate into @xmath74 may be the result of part of the wave - function being a four - quark state @xcite .",
