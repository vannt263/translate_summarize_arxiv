    "sn  2008s is one of the most mysterious optical transients created by a massive star in the last decade .",
    "it was discovered in february 2008 by @xcite in the prolific supernova factory ngc  6946 .",
    "it was initially classified as a likely  supernova impostor \" due to its faint absolute peak magnitude ( @xmath11  mag ) and optical spectra dominated by narrow balmer , ca  ii triplet , and [ ca  ii ] lines in emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  6946 had been observed by the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) the previous year , and the key piece of evidence from these observations was that there was no optical progenitor @xcite , which was surprising since the `` supernova impostors '' are believed to be eruptions from very massive ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) , evolved stars ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) that should have been easily visible in the lbt observations .",

    "this possibility was confirmed when @xcite found the progenitor star as a @xmath70 , @xmath71  k blackbody in archival spitzer data .",
    "this luminosity is comparable to that of an evolved @xmath72 star , and is well below that corresponding to the more massive stars thought to be required for non - supernova eruptions .",
    "subsequent analyses of the progenitor by @xcite and @xcite were consistent with those by @xcite .    more remarkably , an almost identical event then occurred in ngc  300 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the progenitor was invisible in the optical to even tighter limits ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but we again found the progenitor as a self - obscured star of similar luminosity and ( dust photosphere ) temperature in spitzer mid - ir data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a subsequent analysis of the progenitor by @xcite agreed with our estimates , and an investigation of the progenitor based on its neighboring stars by @xcite was consistent with the progenitor being a massive star of order @xmath73-@xmath74 , where the analysis favored the upper portions of this range but , strictly speaking , the method only provides an upper mass bound .    in @xcite we surveyed the galaxy m33 for mid - ir sources with similar properties to these progenitors and found that they were astonishingly rare , with only a few such sources in the entire galaxy . in the mid - ir , these sources have the properties of super - agb stars , with properties distinct from other classes of massive stars such as lbvs and red supergiants .",
    "the rarity of these sources compared to all massive stars , confirmed in our survey of additional galaxies @xcite , means that the progenitors of the transients are a very short lived ( @xmath75  years ) phase in the evolution of these massive stars and that there is a causal connection between obscuration and explosion .",
    "@xcite concluded that there are a number of possible mechanisms to explain the nature of these transients and their progenitors : ( 1 ) massive white - dwarf birth ; ( 2 ) electron - capture supernova ; ( 3 ) intrinsically low - luminosity iron core - collapse supernova ; and ( 4 ) massive star outbursts .",
    "debates about these possible origins have been raging ever since then , based both on theoretical and observational arguments .",
    "they are basically divided into the ( some kind of ) supernova camp ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the ( some kind of ) massive star outburst camp ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the outburst camp generally argues that the progenitor was not a @xmath76 super - agb star but a more massive @xmath77 star ( supported by @xcite ) , despite their position at the red , high luminosity end of the agb sequence in mid - ir color - magnitude diagrams ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the low mass compared to typical stars with lbv outbursts ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the massive - star outburst interpretation is seriously called into question by our spitzer irs spectrum of the ngc  300 event ( @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum resembles that of carbon - rich proto - planetary nebulae and lacks the silicate - dominated dust features typical of massive star outbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , analyzing post - event spitzer observations of sn  2008s , also found that the silicate dust characteristics of high mass stars were inconsistent with the observations .",
    "@xcite also note that proto - planetary nebulae ( initial masses @xmath78 ) have most of the optical spectral features that led @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to argue for an outburst from a more massive ( @xmath79 ) star .",
    "since `` type iin '' optical spectroscopic properties are seen in some proto - planetary nebulae , massive supergiants , supernova impostors , and the genuine , but very diverse , type iin supernovae , they appear only to be a diagnostic for the presence of strong interactions between ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium rather than a diagnostic for the source of the ejecta .",
    "most recently @xcite re - analyzed the available data for sn  2008s and ngc  300-ot and concluded that both transients were of explosive nature .",
    "if the transients were not explosive , the energy would not be sufficient to destroy the obscuring dust and make the transients visible in the optical .",
    "after the peak of the transient , the dust rapidly reforms from the outside , and the luminosity , which then comes from the shock propagating through the dense wind , is mostly reradiated by that dust in the ir .",
    "the model predicts that the peak obscuration is 2 - 3 years post - transient , when the shock reaches the reformed dust shell and pushes its radius outwards .",
    "it should take another 5 - 10 years ( in the case of sn  2008s ) before it is possible to see through the dust and determine the fate of the progenitor star .    here",
    "we report the data on sn  2008s used in this analysis .",
    "we have been following the sn  2008s event with the lbt in both the optical and near - ir , with hst in the near - ir , and with sst in the mid - ir .",
    "here we report that the source is again too faint to detect in the optical , marginally detected in near - ir hst images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hst ] ) , and still bright in the mid - ir .",
    "it is presently much more luminous than the progenitor and slowly fading .",
    "we describe our observations and results in  2 and discuss their implications in  3 .",
    "the optical observations were done with the large binocular cameras ( lbc , @xcite ) , using the lbc / blue camera for @xmath80 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the lbc / red camera for @xmath17 .",
    "the pixel scale of the lbc cameras is @xmath81 .",
    "since these observations are part of a program whose overall goal is to use difference imaging to characterize variable sources , the sub - images obtained for each epoch were not dithered and sn  2008s was always located at approximately the same point on chip  2 of the cameras .",
    "image exposure times were @xmath82  sec , generally with two exposures for @xmath80 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 and 6 exposures for @xmath17 .",
    "the near - ir observations were made with lucifer ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in the @xmath2 and @xmath19 bands using the f3.75 camera with a pixel scale of @xmath83 . at each dither position we obtained 3 exposures of 33 ( 10 ) sec for @xmath2 ( @xmath19 ) band .",
    "we obtained 10 on - source and 6 off - source dither positions in a 2 - 5 - 2 - 5 - 2 off - on - off - on - off pattern , where the off - source position was shifted 8  arcmin away from the galaxy .",
    "another set of near - ir observations was obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfc3/ir camera in @xmath84 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath2 ) filters ( proposal i d 12331 ) .",
    "the exposure times were 1x800s in @xmath18 and 3x700s in @xmath2 and were taken in august 2010 and 2011 .",
    "in addition to the near - ir hst observations , we obtained mid - ir data with warm spitzer on august and december 2010 ( program i d 70040 ) , with exposure times of 8@xmath8630s at both @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the optical and near - ir lbt data were reduced using standard methods in iraf .",
    "the photometry was obtained using daophot and allstar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical data was calibrated using @xmath87 local standards from @xcite for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands and from @xcite for the @xmath80 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "the near - ir lbt data were calibrated using @xmath88 2mass stars in the field . in both cases",
    "we only applied a zero - point offset to convert the instrumental magnitudes into the standard system .",
    "the photometry on the hst near - ir data was made with the dolphot package ( @xcite ) utilizing the wfc3 module which provides specific psfs and pixel area maps and automatically applies all the necessary corrections . for the mid - ir sst data , we used aperture photometry with an aperture radius 4 pixels ( 2@xmath894 ) and a background annulus 4 - 12 pixels .",

    "fitting a blackbody to the measured @xmath19-band flux and the extrapolated @xmath2-band estimate ( @xmath106  mag ) , we get a temperature of 700  k and a luminosity of @xmath107 .",

    "the source has faded by another 1.25  mag in the @xmath2-band between december 2010 and august 2011 and by now is probably undetectable in the near - ir .",

    "<S> we obtained late - time optical and near - ir imaging of sn  2008s with the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) , near - ir data with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and mid - ir data with the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ( 1 ) it is again invisible at optical ( @xmath0 ) wavelengths to magnitude limits of approximately @xmath1  mag , ( 2 ) while detected in the near - ir ( @xmath2 ) at approximately @xmath3  mag , it is fading rapidly , and ( 3 ) it is still brighter than the progenitor at @xmath4 and @xmath5 m in the mid - ir with a slow , steady decline . </S>",
    "<S> the ir detections in december 2010 are consistent with dust emission at a blackbody temperature of @xmath6  k and a total luminosity of @xmath7  @xmath8 , much higher than the @xmath9 luminosity of the obscured progenitor star . </S>",
    "<S> the local environment also shows no evidence for massive ( @xmath10 ) stars in the vicinity of the transient , consistent with the progenitor being a massive agb star . </S>"
