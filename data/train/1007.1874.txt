    "the full circles denote lattice positions of the ising spins @xmath0 , while the empty ones label lattice positions of the heisenberg spins @xmath1 . for further convenience ,",
    "the total hamiltonian can be defined as a sum of the cluster hamiltonians , i.e. @xmath2 , where each cluster hamiltonian @xmath3 involves all the interaction terms of the heisenberg trimer from the @xmath4-th triangle unit cell depicted in fig .",

    "a crucial step of our approach lies in evaluation of the partition function . due to a commutability of different bond hamiltonians ,",
    "the partition function can be partially factorized to a product @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath17 denotes the absolute temperature and @xmath18 is the total number of the ising spins .",
    "furthermore , the symbol @xmath19 stands for a trace over degrees of freedom of the @xmath4-th heisenberg trimer and the indicated summation runs over all available configurations of the ising spins .    to find an explicit form of the partition function @xmath20 , it is sufficient to consider only two symmetry - distinct configurations of the ising spins enclosing the @xmath4-th heisenberg trimer and to diagonalize the relevant hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) for both independent spin configurations . in this way",
    ", one obtains two different cluster partition functions , the one @xmath21 for all three ising spins aligned parallel and the one @xmath22 for one of three ising spins aligned antiparallel with respect to the other two .",
    "these expressions are rather cumbersome and hence , they are not explicitly given here for brevity .",
    "subsequently , the partition function @xmath20 can be substituted by means of the generalized star - triangle transformation @xcite , as schematically depicted in fig .",

    "considering only two symmetry - distinct configurations of three ising spins enclosing the @xmath4-th heisenberg trimer , the mapping parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be expressed with the help of both independent cluster partition functions @xmath27^{1/4 } \\\\   2 \\beta r \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! & = & \\ ! \\ ! \\ ! \\ln [ { \\cal z}_k ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) ] - \\ln [ { \\cal z}_k ( 1/2,1/2,-1/2 ) ] . \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the precise mapping relationship between the partition function of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the triangle - hexagon lattice and the partition function of a simple spin-1/2 ising model on the triangular lattice can be obtained by direct substitution of the star - triangle transformation ( [ 3 ] ) into the formula ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath28 our exact calculation of the partition function @xmath29 is thus formally completed , since the exact result for the partition function of the spin-1/2 ising model on a triangular lattice is well known @xcite .",
    "note that all the other thermodynamic quantities can also be calculated in a rather straightforward way using the basic relations of thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "first , let us focus on the ground state of the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the triangle - hexagon lattice .",
    "the ground state of this geometrically frustrated spin system consists of two different spontaneously long - range ordered phases and one disordered spin - liquid phase .",
    "the disordered spin - liquid phase with a non - zero residual entropy appears whenever antiferromagnetic interaction between the heisenberg spins ( @xmath30 ) is assumed , because the outer ising spins become geometrically frustrated on behalf of the frustrated character of the heisenberg spins from the inner triangles . for the ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "the ising spins always exhibit a perfect ferromagnetic long - range order , while the heisenberg spins are ferromagnetically aligned with respect to each other in the classical ferromagnetic phase ( cfp ) or display a remarkable two - up one - down spin arrangement in the quantum ferromagnetic phase ( qfp ) .",
    "the phase boundary between cfp and qfp is given by the constraint @xmath32 the cfp occurs whenever @xmath33 , while the qfp appears for any @xmath34 .    next ,",
    "let us discuss the dependence of the critical temperature on the ratio @xmath35 between the heisenberg and ising interactions .",
    "the critical temperature can easily be obtained by comparing the effective interaction @xmath36 with the respective critical value @xmath37 of the corresponding spin-1/2 ising model on a triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the critical temperature is a monotonically decreasing function of the ratio @xmath35 for the easy - axis exchange anisotropies ( @xmath38 ) , while it becomes a more interesting non - monotonic dependence that reflects a crossover from cfp to qfp whenever the easy - plane exchange anisotropies ( @xmath39 ) are considered .      the dependences of critical temperature converge to three different limiting values in the limit of @xmath40 for @xmath39 , @xmath41 and in special case of @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath41 , the critical temperature tends to the value @xmath43{3})/2]}$ ] , for @xmath39 the critical temperature converges to the value @xmath44{3})/2]}$ ] .",
    "the straight vertical lines in the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] represent the phase boundaries between cfp and qfp for three different values of the easy - plane exchange anisotropy @xmath39 .    in conclusion",
    ", the exact solution for the spin-1/2 ising - heisenberg model on the triangle - hexagon lattice has been derived within the framework of the generalized star - triangle transformation , which has been used for a detailed analysis of the ground - state and finite - temperature phase diagrams . in the future , we plan to complete the present study by calculating other thermodynamic quantities confirming aforedescribed scenario ."
