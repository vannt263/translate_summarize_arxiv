    "the magnetic field in the solar photosphere exists in a complex and continually evolving state that is driven by convective motions under the surface .",
    "the dynamic interplay between the magnetic field and the plasma has been called the sun s `` magnetic carpet '' @xcite .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the topology and strength of the magnetic field and the energy deposition that is responsible for the hot ( @xmath0 k ) solar corona .",
    "we also know that the gas pressure associated with coronal heating is an important contributor to accelerating the supersonic solar wind @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to wonder to what extent the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) motions in the magnetic carpet are ultimately responsible for producing at least some of the solar wind s mass loss .",
    "recently , two distinct classes of theoretical explanation have been proposed for the combined problem of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration . in the _ wave",
    "/ turbulence - driven _ ( wtd ) models , convection jostles the open magnetic flux tubes that are rooted in the photosphere and produces waves that propagate into the corona .",
    "these waves ( usually assumed to be alfvn waves ) are proposed to partially reflect back down toward the sun , develop into mhd turbulence , and heat the plasma by their gradual dissipation @xcite . in the _ reconnection / loop - opening _ ( rlo ) class of models , it is assumed that closed , loop - like magnetic flux systems are the dominant source of mass and energy into the open - field regions . some have suggested that rlo - type energy exchange primarily occurs on small , supergranular scales @xcite .",
    "however , other models have been proposed in which the `` interchange reconnection '' occurs in and between large - scale coronal streamers further from the solar surface @xcite .",
    "the wtd idea of a flux tube that is open  and which stays open as the wind accelerates  is conceptually simpler than the idea of frequent changes in the flux tube topology . because of this simplicity",
    ", the wtd models have been subject to a greater degree of development and testing than the rlo models .",
    "in addition , we have a great deal of observational evidence that waves and turbulent motions are present everywhere from the photosphere to the heliosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is of interest to pursue the wtd idea to see how these waves affect the mean state of the plasma in the absence of any other sources of energy .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite showed that a set of wtd models that varied only the magnetic flux - tube expansion rate ( and kept all other parameters fixed , including the wave fluxes at the lower boundary ) can successfully predict a wide range of measured properties of both fast and slow solar wind streams .",
    "rlo models need to be subjected to the same degree of development , testing , and refinement as the wtd models .",
    "this idea has a natural appeal since the open flux tubes must be rooted in the vicinity of closed loops @xcite .",
    "in fact , multiple rlo - like reconnection events have been observed in coronal holes as `` polar jets '' by instruments aboard _",
    "soho , _ _ hinode , _ and _ stereo _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "reconnection at the edges of coronal holes may be necessary to produce their observed rigid rotation @xcite .",
    "there are also observed correlations between the lengths of coronal loops , the electron temperature in the low corona , and the wind speed in interplanetary space @xcite that are highly suggestive of a net transfer of magnetic energy from the loops to the open - field regions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "testing the rlo idea using theoretical models is more difficult than testing the wtd idea because of the complex multi - scale nature of the relevant magnetic fields",
    ". many aspects of rlo - type processes can not be simulated without resorting to fully three - dimensional and time - dependent models of the connection between the magnetic carpet and the solar wind .",
    "the goal of this paper is to begin constructing such models in order to address several of the following unanswered questions about the rlo model .",
    "for example , how much of the magnetic energy that is liberated by reconnection goes into simply reconfiguring the closed fields , and how much goes into changing closed fields into open fields ?",
    "specifically , what is the actual rate at which magnetic flux opens up from the magnetic carpet ? can the observed polar jets provide enough energy to drive a significant fraction of the solar wind ?",
    "lastly , how is the reconnection energy distributed into various forms ( e.g. , bulk kinetic energy , thermal energy , waves , or energetic particles ) that can each affect the accelerating wind in different ways ?    in this paper we present monte carlo models of the solar magnetic carpet that are used to determine the topology , temporal variability , and energy flux along field lines connected with the accelerating solar wind .",
    "section [ sec:2 ] gives an overview of the motivations behind our choices of modeling technique . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we describe the physical ingredients that went into the monte carlo models of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] then presents the results of these models and compares them with a range of observational diagnostics . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we then describe how field lines were extrapolated from the photospheric lower boundary up into the corona , and we discuss the resulting time scales and energy fluxes that were derived for flux tubes relevant to rlo wind acceleration models .",
    "finally , section [ sec:6 ] concludes this paper with a brief summary of the major results , a discussion of some of the wider implications of this work , and suggestions for future improvements .",
    "in this section we summarize the techniques that we chose to simulate the connections between the photospheric magnetic field and the open flux tubes feeding the solar wind .",
    "it is also important to clarify how and why our assumptions are consistent with the goal to quantify the impact of rlo physical processes .",
    "our modeling was done in two steps .",
    "first , we simulated the photospheric magnetic carpet by means of a monte carlo ensemble of positive and negative monopole sources of magnetic flux .",
    "these sources are assumed to emerge from below ( as bipolar ephemeral regions ) , move around on the surface , merge or cancel with their neighbors , and spontaneously fragment .",
    "we specified the rates and other details about these processes by comparing with many different observational constraints .",
    "second , we used the photospheric flux sources to extrapolate field lines up into the corona by assuming a potential field .    despite the model s reliance on flux emergence from below the solar surface",
    ", we did not model the subphotospheric motions explicitly .",
    "a complete treatment of this problem should describe how the photospheric fields are ultimately controlled by the overturning dynamics of convection cells and their interactions with one another ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in many ways , however , the photosphere is believed to act as a relatively `` clean '' transition layer between the highly fragmented fibril fields of the convection zone and the space - filling fields of the corona @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of the rapid change in plasma conditions between these regions to utilize the thin photospheric layer as a natural lower boundary .",
    "thus , we used observations of individual features and their motions to set up statistical rules for how these features evolve in our monte carlo models of the photosphere .",
    "the ultimate test of the validity of these rules is that the resulting complex and multi - scale photospheric field matches a wide range of observations .",
    "( of course , the observations used to test the models must be independent of the observations that were used to determine the rules ; see section [ sec:4 ] below for more details . )",
    "many earlier studies of magnetic flux transport in the photosphere were focused on the net horizontal diffusion of fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a new era was ushered in by @xcite , who constructed a statistical model that also included flux emergence , cancellation , merging , and fragmenting .",
    "numerical simulations of these effects were also produced by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our monte carlo models of the photospheric magnetic carpet are based on these earlier models , but with three main differences : ( 1 ) we use more up - to - date flux emergence rates @xcite , which give at least an order of magnitude faster `` recycling time '' for photospheric flux ; ( 2 ) we model both balanced and imbalanced regions on the solar surface that are designed to simulate both quiet sun and coronal hole areas ; and",
    "( 3 ) we do not presume the existence of supergranular motions on the surface  but the model does produce a network - like organization of the field as a natural output ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at each time step in the monte carlo simulations , we extrapolate magnetic field lines up into the corona by assuming the field is derivable from a scalar potential . although the actual solar field is likely to have significant non - potential components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the approximation of a potential field has been found to be useful in identifying the regions where magnetic reconnection must be taking place @xcite .",
    "the potential - field method is also many orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than solving the full three - dimensional mhd conservation equations .",
    "( doing the latter for a system with a complex , evolving , magnetic - carpet - like lower boundary is still prohibitively expensive in terms of computation time . )",
    "our method involves ignoring the `` internal '' details about how magnetic reconnection actually affects the coronal plasma and only investigating the magnetic energy that is lost via reconnection .",
    "we use longcope s ( @xcite ) _ minimum current corona _ model to take account of the reconnection energetics .",
    "we emphasize that  despite the title of this paper ",
    "magnetic reconnection is not a primary `` driver '' unto itself and is merely the end product of the flux emergence , cancellation , merging , fragmentation , and diffusion that occurs on the photospheric lower boundary .    by modeling only the net changes in the magnetic field from one time step to the next",
    ", we end up ignoring some potentially important plasma effects . for example",
    ", @xcite showed that reconnection may progress much more slowly in full mhd than one would expect from modeling the system as an idealized succession of potential - field states .",
    "also , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others have shown that long - lived , field - aligned currents can exist in the corona due to the injection of magnetic flux from below , and these energetically important structures are not accounted for in potential - field models . however , we do not model the most topologically complicated regions of the corona , such as the footpoints of field lines that connect to the cusps of helmet streamers , or to the heliospheric current sheet , or to other large - scale separatrix and quasi - separatrix layers ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our models generally presume the existence of a simple unipolar field at a large height , in conjunction with the complex and time - varying magnetic carpet field at the bottom .",
    "these `` open '' unipolar fields may in fact close back down onto the solar surface on spatial scales larger than our modeled patches of the sun . whether this occurs or not depends on the global distribution of magnetic flux across the entire solar surface , which is beyond the scope of this paper to model .",
    "there have been many three - dimensional mhd simulations of the coronal response to underlying photospheric motions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this paper does not attempt to reproduce those results .",
    "the spatial and temporal complexity of the footpoint motions in most mhd models , however , has usually been assumed to be simpler than in the full magnetic carpet as modeled here .",
    "we also ignore the possibility that there could be a significant back - reaction from the corona on the dynamics of the photospheric footpoints ( see * ? ? ?",
    "others have studied how the evolving photospheric field can affect the properties of coronal alfvn waves @xcite , coronal mass ejections @xcite , and the large - scale heliospheric magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is much more limited .",
    "we aim to take an initial census of the rate at which closed flux opens up from the sun s magnetic carpet , and to estimate how much magnetic energy may be released by the attendant reconnection .",
    "thus , this paper is envisioned as a kind of `` pathfinder '' study that carves out the order - of - magnitude expectations for what more sophisticated mhd simulations are likely to reveal in detail .",
    "in our model , the topology and energy balance of the coronal magnetic field are assumed to be fully determined by the lower boundary conditions at the solar photosphere .",
    "here we describe how the photospheric field can be simulated by assuming it consists of a collection of evolving flux sources .",
    "we developed a fortran code called bones to produce monte carlo simulations of these flux sources and to trace magnetic flux tubes up into the corona .",
    "the title bones was inspired by the popular conception of the solar magnetic field as a topological _ skeleton _ for locating important sites of energy release @xcite , and also by the dependence on randomness in the monte carlo technique ( i.e. , `` rolling the bones '' ) .    for a monte carlo simulation like this ,",
    "it is not possible to write down a single set of equations that governs the behavior of the magnetic field .",
    "each simulation is a particular realization of an ensemble of possible states ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we must describe the individual processes that govern the motion and evolution of the flux elements .",
    "section [ sec:3.1 ] introduces some of the general attributes of the bones simulations .",
    "the code models the time dependence of the photospheric field as the net result of four processes : emergence of new bipoles ( section [ sec:3.2 ] ) , random horizontal motions ( section [ sec:3.3 ] ) , merging and cancellation between pairs of nearby elements ( section [ sec:3.4 ] ) , and spontaneous fragmentation ( section [ sec:3.5 ] ) .",
    "we modeled a patch of the photospheric solar surface as a horizontal square box that extends 200 mm on each side .",
    "this length scale was chosen to be large enough to encompass several supergranular network cells , but small enough to be applicable to solar wind source regions of roughly uniform character ( i.e. , coronal holes or quiet sun ) and to be able to ignore the radial curvature of the solar surface .",
    "thus , the surface area of the model domain is defined as @xmath1 @xmath2 , or about 0.7% of the sun s surface area .    in the part of the bones code that evolves the photospheric magnetic field ,",
    "each flux element is considered to be a point - like monopole having only three attributes : an @xmath3 position , a @xmath4 position , and a signed magnetic flux @xmath5 .",
    "even though many elements are injected into the simulation in equal - and - opposite pairs ( i.e. , as the footpoints of bipole loops ) , the code retains no memory of that association in subsequent time steps .",
    "we quantized the magnetic flux in units of @xmath6 mx so that incomplete cancellations do not produce a huge number of infinitesimally small elements ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we computed the continuous magnetic field that results from the flux elements in several ways . in section [ sec:5.1 ]",
    "we describe the computation of the vector field @xmath7 above the photospheric surface . here",
    "we show how an upper limit on the magnetic field strength in the flux elements ( in the photosphere ) can be used to obtain a lower limit on their spatial extent .",
    "let us assume that the horizontal cross section of a flux element is circular , and that it is filled with a constant vertical magnetic field .",
    "it is generally assumed that the field in small photospheric concentrations can not be significantly stronger than the so - called equipartition field , in which the plasma is in total pressure equilibrium with its ( approximately field - free ) surroundings . in this case , the upper limit on the field strength is @xmath8 g ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we can estimate a lower limit to the radius of the circular flux element as @xmath9 the typical size of observed intergranular g - band bright points is @xmath10150 km @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the filling factor ( @xmath11% ) and number density ( @xmath12 mm@xmath13 ) of bright points in quiet sun regions , and these values are consistent with a radius of @xmath14 km .",
    "the above range of sizes corresponds appropriately to fluxes at the low end of the range simulated here ; i.e. , between @xmath6 and @xmath15 mx .",
    "elements with larger fluxes may not be completely filled by equipartition fields , and thus they would have larger spatial extents than expected from equation ( [ eq : rc ] ) .    at any one time in the simulation , the sum of all positive fluxes is denoted @xmath16 and the sum of all negative fluxes is denoted @xmath17 .",
    "these are signed quantities , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for all models discussed below that have an imbalance between the two polarities , the sense of the imbalance is always to have @xmath20 .",
    "all results should be equivalent for imbalances in the opposite sense .",
    "the mean magnetic flux densities in the positive and negative flux elements , taken over the entire simulation domain , are denoted @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the total `` unsigned '' or absolute flux density is given by @xmath22 and the net flux density is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the simulation s flux imbalance fraction @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "small values for this ratio ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) are typical for quiet sun regions , and larger values ( @xmath27 ) are typical for coronal holes @xcite .",
    "each run of the bones code begins with specified initial conditions at time @xmath28 . for models having @xmath29",
    ", there are no flux elements in the domain at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "perfect flux balance is maintained by having all new flux elements emerge into the domain at later times as balanced bipoles . for models having @xmath30 ,",
    "the simulation begins with a number of identical flux elements , all having positive polarity , that are distributed randomly over the surface @xmath31 .",
    "these initial elements are assumed to each have an equal flux given by 0.1 times the mean flux in an emerging bipole ( see section [ sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "the number of these initial elements is determined by the input value of the net flux density @xmath32 . as in the @xmath29 case ,",
    "all new flux elements that enter the domain at @xmath33 are balanced pairs , and thus @xmath32 remains exactly constant as a function of time .    for a given simulation that is intended to model a patch of the sun having an imposed flux imbalance ratio @xmath24 ,",
    "the choice of the proper input value of @xmath32 is not known at the outset .",
    "the overall level of magnetic flux that ends up existing in the simulation depends on the collection of dynamical parameters that describe the flux emergence , fragmentation , horizontal diffusion , and merging ( see below ) .",
    "specifically , the emergence rate @xmath34 depends explicitly on @xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , for a given set of dynamical parameters and a desired value of @xmath24 , we had to produce an iterative set of trial runs with a range of guesses for @xmath32 .",
    "only one unique value of @xmath32 gave rise to a model having the proper self - consistent value of @xmath24 .",
    "after doing this for a range of models , the relationship between these two parameters was fit with the following approximate relation , @xmath35^{0.365 } }   \\,\\ , ,    \\label{eq : xifit}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is measured in gauss and @xmath24 is dimensionless .",
    "the discrete time step chosen for the simulations was @xmath37 s , the same as that used by @xcite .",
    "five minutes is a representative time scale for photospheric granulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so using a smaller time scale would only be appropriate if the coherent granular motions were being modeled explicitly .",
    "@xcite found that on spatial scales longer than 300500 km the solar granulation acts as a stochastic , markovian process .",
    "for representative granulation velocities of order 1 km s@xmath38 @xcite , this confirms that the minimum resolvable time scale ( when ignoring coherent convective overturning ) should be about 300500 s. for all processes in the bones code that are simulated as occurring stochastically , we used the ran2 random number generator of @xcite .",
    "this routine does not repeat its pseudo - random sequence until called at least @xmath39 times .",
    "this limit was never approached , since in even the longest runs of the code the ran2 routine was never called more than @xmath40 times .    over the course of each time step @xmath41 , the code updates the properties of each of the flux elements from the effects of the four general sets of processes described below .",
    "bipolar magnetic features are observed to emerge from beneath the photosphere with fluxes spanning several orders of magnitude from @xmath4210@xmath43 mx ( internetwork concentrations ) to @xmath4210@xmath44 mx ( sunspots ) @xcite .",
    "away from active regions , much of the emergence tends to occur in the form of bipolar _ ephemeral regions _ ( ers ) with @xmath45@xmath46 mx ( see ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the individual poles of ers often are advected to the edges of supergranular cells and coalesce to form _ network concentrations _ that end up with similar absolute fluxes as the ers themselves @xcite .",
    "the rate of emergence of er flux , which we denote @xmath34 , has been estimated in various ways from both measurements and models . as the sensitivity and cadence of observations has improved ,",
    "the derived emergence rates have generally increased .",
    "@xcite reviewed earlier measurements and models that pointed to a range of @xmath34 values between about @xmath47 and @xmath48 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "earlier monte carlo models also found that values in this range seemed to behave in similar ways as the real sun .",
    "for example , @xcite used @xmath50 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 , and @xcite used @xmath51 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "@xcite found that a slightly higher value of @xmath52 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 was needed to reproduce _ trace _ measurements of the chromospheric network . assuming a mean flux density in the quiet sun of about 3 to 4 mx cm@xmath13 , it is possible to use the above emergence rates to estimate `` flux recycling times '' between about 0.5 and 20 days .",
    "however , many of these earlier measurements were made with sequences of relatively low - cadence magnetograms .",
    "@xcite found that when the cadences are reduced from about 90 min to 5 min , many more emergence events are observed and the emergence rate increases .",
    "in fact , @xcite claimed that it is virtually impossible to even _ identify _ the same er from one image to the next unless the time cadence between them is shorter than about 10 min .",
    "the revised analysis of @xcite showed that values as large as @xmath53 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 are often seen in regions of balanced magnetic polarities , along with a noticeable decrease in @xmath34 as @xmath24 increases from 0 to 1 .",
    "for most values of the imbalance ratio ( @xmath54 ) , these rates of emergence are consistent with flux recycling times of only 12 hr .",
    "we fit the modified rates shown in table 2 and figure 5 of @xcite with a quadratic function of the imbalance ratio @xmath24 , and found @xmath55 for a region with balanced magnetic flux ( @xmath56 ) , the maximum value of the emergence rate is @xmath57 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 . as @xmath58 ,",
    "the parameterized rate declines to a minimum value of @xmath59 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "note , however , that the largest imbalance fraction in the measurements of @xcite was @xmath60 .",
    "our use of values larger than this represents extrapolation .",
    "it is possible that @xmath34 may decrease more rapidly  possibly to zero  as @xmath24 increases from 0.94 to 1 . in any case",
    ", we never model the completely unipolar case of @xmath61 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath24 used in the models presented below is 0.99 .    in order to determine the number of bipoles ( @xmath62 ) that emerge in each time step in the simulation domain",
    ", we adopted a fiducial value for the average flux per bipole , @xmath63 mx ( see below ) .",
    "thus , @xmath64 . in general , this does not yield an integer number of bipoles . for a given non - integer value of @xmath62 that falls between the two integers @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we used the fractional remainder of @xmath62 ( in excess of @xmath65 ) to determine the statistical chance that the resulting number of bipoles is either @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "for example , if @xmath67 , there is a 22% chance that there will be 11 bipoles , and a 78% chance there will be 10 bipoles .",
    "a new random number is generated in each time step to determine whether there will be @xmath65 or @xmath66 new bipoles .",
    "for each of the emerging bipoles , the bones code determines its total absolute flux by drawing from an empirically constrained probability distribution of the form @xmath68 / \\phi_{0}^{2 } , &      \\phi \\geq \\phi_{\\rm min } \\\\      0 \\ , , & \\phi < \\phi_{\\rm min }    \\end{array }   \\right .",

    "the measurements shown in figure 3 of @xcite provided constraints on the functional form of equation ( [ eq : probe ] ) , as well as values for @xmath70 mx and @xmath63 mx .",
    "these values uniquely specify the value of the exponential slope @xmath71 mx .    in order for the code to sample from the above distribution , we computed the cumulative probability distribution by integrating equation ( [ eq : probe ] ) numerically .",
    "a parameterized functional fit to the inverse of the cumulative distribution was then found which allows a uniform random variable ( between 0 and 1 ) to be mapped into a proper sampling of @xmath72 .",
    "once a random value of @xmath5 has been chosen in this way from the distribution , we divided the absolute flux equally between the two poles .",
    "we note that because the sampling from the distribution is random , and because @xmath62 has been truncated to be an integer , the exact same amount of flux does not emerge in each time step .",
    "however , over many time steps the specified emergence rate @xmath34 is maintained on average .    for each emerging bipole ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 positions of the positive pole are determined randomly .",
    "the position of the negative pole is displaced from the positive pole by a horizontal distance @xmath73 and a random orientation angle .",
    "the separation @xmath73 must be large enough that the poles will not immediately cancel one another out .",
    "we assume that @xmath73 scales with the size of the flux element @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the dimensionless proximity factor that sets the scale for merging and cancellation ( see section [ sec:3.4 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath77 , the poles are constrained to be noninteracting . for this calculation",
    "we use the total flux in the entire bipole in the definition of @xmath74 ( equation ( [ eq : rc ] ) ) , so for the mean @xmath78 , the mean separation @xmath73 is 6.8 mm .",
    "this value of @xmath73 is within the rather wide observational range of separations for newly emerged er bipoles ( approximately 210 mm ) , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite found that @xmath79 , which is a weaker dependence than what we assumed ( @xmath80 ) by using equation ( [ eq : rc ] ) .",
    "magnetic flux concentrations are observed to move around on the solar surface in response to plasma flows that occur on scales ranging from narrow intergranular lanes ( 0.050.1 mm ) up to the supergranular network ( @xmath4230 mm ) .",
    "our models were designed to test the assumption that much of the structuring on the largest scales is a natural by - product of smaller - scale motions ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the motions of flux elements are assumed to be of a diffusive character and dominated by granule - scale ( 12 mm ) horizontal step sizes .",
    "this stands in contrast to other monte carlo models of the magnetic carpet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the motions of the elements are influenced by an imposed supergranular flow pattern .    for each time step @xmath41 , we describe the horizontal motion of a flux element as a linear trajectory with speed @xmath81 and a random orientation angle in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane .",
    "the orientation angle is recomputed in each time step with no memory of its previous value , so that the long - term trajectory of an element is essentially a `` random walk . ''",
    "observationally , the horizontal speeds are known to depend on the absolute fluxes in the elements , with higher - flux concentrations tending to move with lower speeds .",
    "thus , we used a standard exponential fit for the mean speed @xmath82 , @xmath83 where the constant of @xmath84 mx in the denominator is consistent with observations @xcite and earlier models @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath85 is the mean speed in the limiting case of @xmath86 , and it is a key free parameter in these models .",

    "for the strongest flux elements , the radius of influence is not allowed to become larger than 10 mm .",
    "observationally , there do not appear to be any mergings or cancellations that occur on spatial scales larger than this ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "practically , though , the imposition of this upper limit prevents the occurrence of `` long - range '' interactions that would be inconsistent with the existence of the supergranular network .",

    "thus , our use of the larger values of @xmath34 from @xcite implies much more rapid cancellation than was found in earlier models such as @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the original element keeps a random fraction of its original flux ( constrained to be between 0.55 and 0.999 ) , and the new element gets the remainder of the flux .",
    "the position of the original element stays the same , and the new one is positioned a distance @xmath73 away , with a random orientation angle .",
    "this distance @xmath73 is the same value discussed in section [ sec:3.2 ] , and it is large enough to prevent subsequent merging between the two new flux elements .",
    "in this section we present results from a series of models for the photospheric magnetic field as computed by the bones code . a series of tests was first performed to make sure the code was actually evolving the flux elements as desired .",
    "once the tests verified that each individual process was being modeled correctly , runs were performed that included all of the processes together .",
    "we created a basic set of 11 models with the main adjustable parameter being the flux imbalance ratio @xmath24 .",
    "the input values of @xmath32 for each of these models were iterated until the final models had steady - state values of @xmath24 equal to the desired input values of 0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , and 0.99 ( see equation ( [ eq : xifit ] ) ) .",
    "each model used a different integer as a unique seed for the random number generator .",
    "as described above , our final monte carlo models contained a much larger emergence rate @xmath34 than did the earlier simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if all other adjustable parameters had been kept the _ same _ as in those models , a much larger time - steady magnetic flux would have accumulated in the simulation box over time ; i.e. , the averaged flux densities would have been much larger than the typical values of 310 mx cm@xmath13 observed in quiet regions and coronal holes . in order to keep the flux density low , magnetic concentrations need to be destroyed as rapidly as they are injected from below .",
    "this is why the bones code was run with more rapid horizontal diffusion ( @xmath99 km s@xmath38 ) , more sensitive merging and cancellation ( @xmath104 ) , and more rapid fragmentation ( @xmath115 mx@xmath38 s@xmath38 ) than were used in the earlier models .",
    "time will tell if these parameters accurately represent the real sun , but as long as the emergence rate is high , the models need to facilitate a similarly high rate of cancellation in order to produce a realistic steady state .",
    "below we present results concerning the overall time - steady photospheric magnetic fields in the simulations ( section [ sec:4.1 ] ) , the statistical number distributions of flux elements ( section [ sec:4.2 ] ) , and the natural production of supergranular magnetic structures from the smaller - scale granular motions ( section [ sec:4.3 ] ) .",
    "the bones models were evolved in time , using a step size of @xmath37 s , for a total simulation time usually exceeding 100 days and sometimes exceeding 1000 days ( i.e. , @xmath117@xmath118 time steps ) . over the first 1020 days of a simulation , sufficient magnetic flux",
    "is injected so that the initial conditions are completely `` forgotten '' and the magnetic field reaches a state of time - steady dynamic equilibrium .",
    "thus , whenever we calculate quantities that are meant to represent the time - steady parts of a simulation ( e.g. , means and standard deviations ) , we take only @xmath119 days . in the simulated area @xmath31",
    ", the total number of flux elements in the time - steady state tends to average between 100 and 200 .",
    "although the mean absolute flux per _ injected _ flux element was @xmath120 mx , the eventual mean flux per element in the steady state ended up being about a factor of two larger ( see below ) .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] shows simulated magnetogram images for representative time snapshots in two of the models : one for a region of balanced magnetic flux ( @xmath56 ) and one for a large degree of imbalance ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the continuous magnetic field strength at the photosphere ( @xmath122 ) was calculated using the multiple monopole model described in section [ sec:5.1 ] .",
    "a medium gray shade denotes @xmath123 , and the saturation to white and black is imposed at @xmath124 and @xmath125 g , respectively . for the balanced case",
    ", the neutral line meanders through the domain stochastically and splits the region into two roughly equal areas . for the imbalanced case ,",
    "the neutral lines surround and confine the regions of minority polarity .",
    "the balanced `` quiet sun '' model shown in figure [ fig01](a ) has an average total number of flux elements @xmath126 , with roughly equal numbers of positive and negative elements and an average absolute flux per element of @xmath127 mx .",
    "the imbalanced `` coronal hole '' model shown in figure [ fig01](b ) has an average total @xmath128 , with approximately 81 of the elements being positive and 41 being negative .",
    "note that if the absolute flux per element was equal for the positive and negative populations , we would have expected that @xmath129 elements would be positive , and @xmath130 elements would be negative .",
    "since the number of positive [ negative ] elements is smaller [ larger ] than predicted , it is clear that the two populations must have different average absolute fluxes .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath121 model , the average fluxes per element in the positive and negative sets were @xmath131 mx and @xmath132 mx , respectively .    in figure [ fig02 ]",
    "we plot the time dependence of several statistical quantities for the @xmath56 and @xmath121 cases .",
    "these models reached dynamical equilibrium in only about 5 days of simulation time , and only the first 40 days are shown .",
    "after a stochastic steady state has been established , the level of continuing temporal variability appears similar in character to the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the imbalance ratio @xmath24 does not approach a rigidly constant value , but instead fluctuates with a standard deviation that is typically 2%10% of its mean value .",
    "comparing figures [ fig02](a ) and [ fig02](b ) , we see that as @xmath24 increases the mean of the absolute flux density @xmath133 increases and its variance decreases .",
    "larger values of @xmath24 correspond to lower rates of flux emergence ( see equation ( [ eq : efit ] ) ) , so that a typical flux element in the large-@xmath24 simulation tends to have a longer lifetime before it is destroyed .",
    "however , the functional form of @xmath134 is not the only reason for the increase in @xmath135 with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "it is possible to illustrate such an increase with a simple analytic model that assumes a _ constant _ emergence rate .",
    "if the emergence rate @xmath34 is fixed , but the box - averaged rate of cancellation is assumed to be proportional to the product of the positive and negative flux densities present in the box , then their time evolution can be approximated to be a simple balance between these two effects , with @xmath136 in a steady state , the time derivatives can be ignored and we can solve for @xmath137 .",
    "the individual values of the constants @xmath34 and @xmath138 do not need to be specified explicitly , but let us assume their ratio @xmath139 is a known constant called @xmath140 .",
    "thus , it becomes possible to solve for the absolute flux density in closed form , @xmath141 the above expression shows how @xmath135 must increase with an increasing imbalance ratio @xmath24 , even in the case where @xmath34 is independent of @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] shows how the time - steady values of @xmath133 from the simulations vary as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "the error bars on these model points show @xmath142 standard deviations around the mean values . to ensure that specific realizations of the random number sequences did not affect the results , the means and standard deviations for each value of @xmath24 were computed from three independent runs of the bones code .",
    "each run used a different random seed , and each run was performed for a total of 400 days of simulation time .",
    "the modeled absolute flux densities generally fall between the observationally expected limiting values of about 3 and 10 mx cm@xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] also shows two curves that illustrate the functional dependence of the simple analytic estimate of equation ( [ eq : banalytic ] ) above .",
    "the two curves , which were computed using the arbitrary normalization constants @xmath143 and 2.1 g , appear to bracket the modeled points surprisingly well .    in figure [ fig03 ]",
    "we also plotted measurements made by the vector spectromagnetograph ( vsm ) instrument of the synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun ( solis ) facility @xcite .",
    "we used publicly available full - disk longitudinal magnetograms taken in the 6301.5  line . over the time period from august 2003 to november 2009 , we obtained one magnetogram per month for a total of 73 individual full - disk maps . for each magnetogram we generated a grid of `` macropixels '' covering the central part of the solar disk ( out to 0.7 @xmath144 from disk - center ) .",
    "each macropixel was defined to be @xmath145 magnetogram pixels , or 113@xmath146 square ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each macropixel , we measured the average flux densities of the positive and negative polarities , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , and computed @xmath135 and @xmath24 as defined in section [ sec:3.1 ] .",
    "a total of 8264 individual measured data points are shown in figure [ fig03 ] .",
    "the bulk of the low field - strength solis data shown in figure [ fig03 ] appear to follow the same general increasing trend with @xmath24 as do the modeled points and analytic curves .",
    "the `` long tail '' in the data points that extends upward to 10100 mx cm@xmath13 represents times when the macropixels covered parts of active regions .",
    "points on the upper - left of the plot represent active regions that were mostly centered in the macropixel , and points on the upper - right represent times when only one dominant polarity of an active region was in the macropixel .",
    "the models presented in this paper are generally meant to be simulations of quiet sun and coronal hole regions , which are sampled by the majority of weak - field data points in the lower part of figure [ fig03 ] .",
    "an additional way to verify that the bones simulations produce magnetic fields similar to those on the real sun is to examine the _ probability distributions _ of element fluxes and compare them with observed distributions . because the simulations typically have only 100200 elements in them at any one time , we sampled the distributions a number of times in order to accumulate statistics appropriate for a large number of uncorrelated patches of sun . in the models ,",
    "the time cadence for this sampling was fixed at 30 days .",
    "this time cadence was found to be more than adequate for the requirement that any given distribution of flux elements must be completely recycled from ( i.e. , uncorrelated with ) the distribution at the previous sampling time .",
    "for each case discussed below , the simulations were run until the total number of collected flux elements exceeded @xmath118 .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] shows example distributions for the two models discussed above ( @xmath29 and 0.8 ) .",
    "the distributions of positive and negative polarity elements are plotted separately . for comparison ,",
    "the analytic distribution of emerging flux elements given by equation ( [ eq : probe ] ) is also shown .",
    "this latter distribution has been scaled down in flux by a factor of two ( i.e. , shifted to the left in the plot ) to show the distribution of fluxes in the individual poles of the emerging bipoles , not the total absolute flux in the bipoles as specified by equation ( [ eq : probe ] ) .",
    "for ease of comparison with observations , these plots are shown in the same general format as figures 4 and 6 of @xcite and figures 2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "the time - steady distributions shown in figure [ fig04 ] are substantially `` flatter '' than the initial distribution of emerging flux elements . in other words ,",
    "the fluxes have spread out from the relatively narrow range of injected fluxes ( roughly @xmath15@xmath46 mx ) to both lower and higher values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "most noticeably , the populations of flux elements with @xmath149 mx are hugely enhanced with respect to the distribution of injected flux elements .",
    "these stronger flux elements must be the result of mergings between smaller elements of like polarity .",
    "in addition , the existence of this enhanced strong - flux tail is the reason that the mean flux per element is larger than the mean flux in a newly emerged flux element ( see section [ sec:4.1 ] ) .",
    "although it is difficult to see in the plots , there is also a significant number of elements in the simulations with fluxes _ below _ the minimum emergent flux per element ( @xmath150 mx ) .",
    "these weakest flux elements must be the result of fragmentation and partial cancellation . for the @xmath56 case ,",
    "22% of the flux elements have fluxes less than this threshold value . because of their small fluxes , however , these account for only about 2.7% of the total absolute flux in the simulation .",
    "for the @xmath121 case , 18% of the flux elements have fluxes below the emerging threshold value , and they account for 1.2% of the total absolute flux .    figure [ fig04](b ) shows the difference between the distributions of positive and negative elements for the imbalanced case of @xmath151 .",
    "overall , the majority polarity has a flatter distribution than does the minority polarity , but there is an excess of minority polarity elements for the weakest fluxes ( @xmath152 mx ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observational conclusions of @xcite for coronal holes . also , the differences in shape shown in figure [ fig04](b ) are highly reminiscent of the flux element distributions shown in figure 2 of @xcite for coronal holes .",
    "the resemblance between the cellular pattern of solar granulation and that of the larger - scale supergranulation has long been interpreted as evidence that both phenomena are manifestations of the sun s convective instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , because the flow patterns in the supergranular network are weak and intermittent , it has not been possible to definitively prove their convective origin . it may be that multiple interactions between granule - scale structures produce a distributed network of downflows that in turn seeds horizontal supergranular flows and the aggregation of strong network fields @xcite .",
    "alternately , the opposite may be the case ; i.e. , it may be the aggregation of small - scale magnetic fields that gives rise to the weak supergranular flows @xcite . in this section",
    "we show that the bones simulations provide some evidence for the initial magnetic - field aggregation described in the latter scenario .",
    "how are the spatial scales of supergranulation measured ?",

    "@xcite and @xcite applied the autocorrelation technique to magnetograms and found scale sizes between 10 and 25 mm , depending on the precise diagnostic techniques used .",
    "finally , @xcite and @xcite used a range of sophisticated algorithms to trace and characterize supergranular boundaries , and found average diameters of only @xmath4215 mm .    because the bones simulations predict only the properties of the magnetic field  and neither the chromospheric emission nor the doppler velocities  we decided that the most straightforward comparison to make would be with the measured magnetogram autocorrelation functions of @xcite .",
    "first , a random time step from each of the 11 models was used to create simulated magnetograms similar to those shown in figure [ fig01 ] .",
    "then , for each @xmath4 row in the magnetogram , we computed a series of one - dimensional autocorrelation functions in the @xmath3 direction for the scalar value of @xmath153 , i.e. , @xmath154 which was then normalized such that @xmath155 .",
    "figure [ fig05](a ) shows an example autocorrelation function from the @xmath56 simulation , plotted as a function of the lag parameter @xmath156 .",
    "similar results were found when the roles of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coordinates were reversed .",
    "we characterized the model autocorrelation functions by finding both the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the central peak and the distance between the central peak and the next secondary maximum ( sm ) . doing this for each value of @xmath4 gave rise to ensembles of values for fwhm and sm in each of the 11 simulations .",
    "figure [ fig05](b ) shows the mean values for each of these ensembles , along with error bars that show @xmath157 standard deviations about the means .",
    "there is no significant @xmath24 dependence in the modeled values .",
    "for all 11 simulations , the average model fwhm is 4.48 mm and the average sm distance is 25.1 mm .",
    "these values compare favorably to the solar observations reported by @xcite ( shown as gray bars in figure [ fig05 ] ) , who found fwhm values between 4 and 6 mm , and sm distances of 15 to 20 mm .",
    "the benefit of making a direct comparison between simulated and observed fwhm and sm values is that there is no need to interpret these quantities in terms of arbitrarily defined cell diameters .",
    "below for a more intuitive way of visualizing the naturally occurring `` supergranular network '' in these simulations . ]",
    "the models appear to succeed in roughly reproducing the observed autocorrelation properties of the network .",
    "it may be possible to explain this success by invoking processes of _ diffusion - limited aggregation _ as suggested by @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "time - steady magnetic structures `` collect '' on specific scales that depend on the combined emergence , diffusion , and cancellation of flux elements .",
    "supergranular flows may then occur as a result of the magnetic structuring .",
    "@xcite performed tests with a monte carlo model that varied several of the discrete step sizes and interaction distances , and found that the resulting supergranular scale size does not depend on these input parameter choices .",
    "instead , it is the overall level of flux emergence and horizontal diffusion  which in turn drives the cancellation rate  that sets the time - steady distance between network concentrations .",
    "one of the major goals of this paper is to explore how the complex photospheric fields in the magnetic carpet connect with time - variable open flux tubes and closed loops in the extended corona .",
    "thus , here we describe how the field lines are traced upwards and are evolved in time ( section [ sec:5.1 ] ) , we summarize the resulting open and closed fields as a function of the flux imbalance ratio @xmath24 ( section [ sec:5.2 ] ) , we compute relevant time scales for the opening up of closed flux tubes ( section [ sec:5.3 ] ) , we estimate the amount of magnetic energy that emerges in the form of bipoles ( section [ sec:5.4 ] ) , and we compare it to the energy released into the solar wind by magnetic reconnection ( section [ sec:5.5 ] ) .",
    "as summarized in section [ sec:2 ] , we compute the vector magnetic field @xmath158 above the photospheric surface by assuming the field is derivable from a scalar potential . in other words ,",
    "each flux element is assumed to act as a monopole - type source , with @xmath159 where the coordinates @xmath160 specify the locations of each flux element @xmath161 , and the field point @xmath162 can be located anywhere at or above the photosphere ( @xmath163 ) .",

    "to avoid singularities at the solar surface , all elements are assumed to be `` submerged '' below the photosphere @xcite . for simplicity we assumed that all flux elements are at a constant depth .",
    "we chose an optimum value of @xmath165 mm on the basis of the following considerations .",
    "the peak magnetic field strength @xmath166 in the photosphere , due to a single flux element , occurs right over the point itself at @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 .",
    "thus , @xmath170 we want to ensure that @xmath171 is less than the equipartition field strength @xmath172 for all elements in the simulation ( see section [ sec:3.1 ] ) . because we do not model pores and sunspots , we can apply this constraint to elements up to a maximum flux of @xmath173 mx .",
    "thus , applying the condition @xmath174 to equation ( [ eq : bpeak ] ) for this value of the flux gives rise to @xmath175 mm . on the other hand",
    ", observations have shown that the field strength in a recently emerged er is at least a few hundred gauss @xcite .",
    "for the average flux in one pole of an emerging er ( i.e. , @xmath176 mx ) , we apply the condition @xmath177 g and obtain an upper limit @xmath178 mm .",
    "the two above constraints on the magnitude of @xmath179 are formally incompatible with one another , but the value @xmath421 mm appears to be a likely compromise between the two .",
    "the bones code contains a subroutine that can either trace field lines up from the photospheric surface or down from a larger height .",
    "the incremental path length @xmath180 for numerical steps taken along the field varies with height , from a minimum value of 0.03 mm at the photosphere to a maximum value of 10 mm at a height of @xmath181 mm . at intermediate heights ,",
    "@xmath182 where @xmath183 .",
    "field lines that begin at the photosphere are traced until they either curve back down to intersect the @xmath122 plane again ( and are called `` closed '' ) or they climb past a maximum height of 200 mm ( and are called `` open '' ) . as discussed in section [ sec:2 ] , on the real sun",
    "it is possible that many flux tubes that reach higher than 200 mm may eventually be closed back down in the form of large - scale helmet streamers . whether this occurs or not depends on the global distribution of magnetic flux across the entire solar surface . in any case , it is likely that some plasma that reaches large heights in streamers also interacts with the accelerating solar wind @xcite , so it may not be too erroneous to classify these field lines as open .    when the monte carlo simulation of the photospheric field settles into a dynamical steady state ( defined here as @xmath184 days ) , we begin tracing field lines in order to compute the coronal vector field in each time step .",
    "this essentially assumes that any temporal changes occur `` instantaneously ; '' i.e. , with a time scale shorter than @xmath96 min .",
    "in similar kinds of potential - field simulations , @xcite found that the actual delay between a given photospheric impulse and the response higher up in the corona is only of order 2 min .",
    "thus , our assumption that @xmath185 can be recomputed from each time step s new lower boundary condition appears to be reasonable .    in order to quantify the changes that occur in the magnetic field from one time step to the next",
    ", we trace a set of field lines that is associated with the @xmath186 flux elements on the surface .",
    "the general idea is to compare the open / closed topology of flux tubes that can be identified unambiguously both at the beginning of a time step and at the end ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". if a flux element moves around on the surface and does not undergo substantial merging , cancellation , or fragmentation , then we can say that it has `` survived '' that time step , and thus it makes sense to evaluate how its open / closed connectivity may have changed . in cases where the merging , cancellation , or fragmentation makes only a minor change to an original element s flux",
    ", we also consider that element to have survived when the element s flux changes by less than a specified fractional threshold @xmath187 . in most runs of the bones code",
    "presented below , @xmath188 .",
    "this means that if a flux element ends the time step with a flux that is within 10% of its original flux , it is classified as being the same element . flux elements that can not be tagged in this way are not counted .",
    "we discuss the effects of varying the @xmath187 parameter below .",
    "rather than just trace one field line from each flux element , we instead chose to more finely resolve the coronal magnetic field by tracing seven field lines from each element .",
    "the initial footpoints of these seven field lines are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with respect to each flux element s circular `` patch '' on the surface .",
    "one field line is centered on the flux element .",
    "the other six are arranged in a ring around the central point with an angular separation of 60 , each at a horizontal distance of @xmath189 from the central point .",
    "this distance is halfway between the flux element s intrinsic radius @xmath74 and its critical interaction distance as defined in section [ sec:3.4 ] . at the beginning of each time",
    "step the bones code traces @xmath190 field lines and tags each footpoint with a unique ( nonzero ) numerical identifier .",
    "each of the flux tubes associated with element @xmath161 is assigned an equal magnetic flux @xmath191 . during the progress of each time step ,",
    "new flux elements that emerge are given an identifier of zero .",
    "also , if merging , cancellation , or fragmentation changes the flux in an element to a degree greater than the relative threshold @xmath187 , its numerical identifier is reset to zero . at the end of each time step",
    ", the coronal field is traced again for the subset of surviving flux elements that have nonzero numerical identifiers .",
    "the magnetic flux in those elements is grouped into four bins that are defined by whether the flux tubes were open or closed at the beginning of the time step , and whether they are open or closed at the end .",
    "section [ sec:5.2 ] discusses the distributions of magnetic flux in those four bins .",
    "we note that our method of accounting for the open and closed magnetic flux has several potential shortcomings . by not counting either the newly emerged flux elements or those that undergo substantial merging , cancellation , or fragmentation",
    ", we run the risk of not seeing fields that may be releasing lots of energy via magnetic reconnection .",
    "we will see below , though , that the magnetic - carpet evolution is not so vigorous that these flux elements represent a significant fraction of the total number .",
    "in fact , for most models the fraction of magnetic flux that is missed by not counting these `` rapid evolvers '' is only of order 5% to 15% .",
    "another possible limitation of our method is that we trace the identities of individual flux tubes for only one time step .",
    "if we wanted to measure more accurate time scales for flux reconfiguration , it may have been advantageous to follow field lines for _ more _ than just one time step .",
    "however , since the magnetic carpet keeps evolving , the number of flux tubes that would become uncountable ( i.e. , missed by virtue of exceeding the threshold @xmath187 ) increases for each additional time step over which flux - tube survival would be traced . following field lines only over the course of one time step , with @xmath96 min , gave the best balance of time resolution and flux capturing .",
    "figure [ fig06 ] illustrates a selection of field lines for bones models with a mostly balanced lower boundary ( @xmath192 ) and a highly imbalanced lower boundary ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the three - dimensional field lines are shown projected into a two - dimensional plane that is defined by an observer viewing the scene at an inclination angle 82 from the normal to the photosphere .",
    "two different shades denote closed versus open field lines .",
    "models with more imbalanced fields ( i.e. , higher values of @xmath24 ) have both a larger fraction of open flux and a smaller vertical extent for the closed loops . both of these trends are examined quantitatively below .",
    "we studied the statistical properties of the closed loops in the simulations by tracing large numbers of field lines from random starting locations @xmath193 in the photosphere .",
    "example time snapshots from the 11 models ( with varying @xmath24 values ) were used to trace at least 5000 loops in each model . for the six models with @xmath194 ,",
    "for which there were fewer open field lines , we were able to compute at least 20000 loops .",
    "the maximum heights of these loops were collected into 11 statistical distributions , one for each model .",
    "although the means and standard deviations of these distributions were computed , the distributions were far from gaussian in shape .",
    "thus , we quantified them further by computing percentile intervals @xmath195 of the sorted cumulative distributions of heights .",
    "for example , 25% of the loops have heights less than the quartile height of @xmath196 , and 50% of the loops have heights less than the median height of @xmath197 .",
    "we also computed @xmath198 and @xmath199 , with the latter being an approximate indicator of the largest loops ( without being dependent on the statistically insignificant tail of the _ very _ largest loops ) .",
    "figure [ fig07 ] shows how the percentile intervals vary as a function of the flux imbalance ratio @xmath24 . on the smallest spatial scales ( i.e. , for granule - sized loops characterized by @xmath196 and @xmath197 ) there",
    "does not appear to be a significant dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "however , the longest loops follow the trend that is visually apparent in figure [ fig06 ] ; i.e. , the more balanced the photospheric field , the larger the loops .",
    "this trend is apparent not only in @xmath198 and @xmath199 , but also in the mean height @xmath200 that is weighted more strongly by the longest loops .",
    "figure [ fig07 ] also shows approximate observational ranges of mean loop heights for quiet sun ( qs ) and coronal hole ( ch ) regions as determined by @xcite .",
    "these loop - height calculations were similar to ours in that they were based on potential - field extrapolations from photospheric lower boundary conditions , but @xcite used observed magnetograms from the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) instrument on _ soho _ ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the overall agreement with the modeled @xmath24 dependence of @xmath200 is good .",
    "the general trend for high-@xmath24 ch regions to have shorter loops than low-@xmath24 qs regions is also consistent with the trend pointed out by @xcite and @xcite for the source regions of fast solar wind to be correlated with short loops and the source regions of slow wind to be correlated with long loops .",
    "a representative illustration of the footpoints of open field lines is given in figure [ fig08 ] for the @xmath151 model .",
    "this plot shows the locations of the photospheric footpoints of @xmath117 field lines that were traced down from an evenly spaced grid at the top ( @xmath201 mm ) . in order to account for the horizontal flaring of potential field lines from the finite - sized simulation box , the grid of @xmath145 starting points had an overall horizontal size of @xmath202 mm in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions ( centered on the @xmath203 mm simulation box ) .",
    "the overall appearance of figure [ fig08 ] is highly reminiscent of the observed supergranular network .",
    "the apparent `` cell diameters '' tend to be between 20 and 40 mm as on the real sun .",
    "note also the appearance of thin channels , stretched between smaller knots of closed - field regions , that appear to support the connectivity theorems described by @xcite .",
    "all of the @xmath117 open field lines with footpoints shown in figure [ fig08 ] are of positive polarity .",
    "this is the dominant polarity as specified by the initial conditions of the bones code ( see section [ sec:3.1 ] ) .",
    "all negative polarities end up connected to positive polarities in closed loops , and thus there are no `` open funnels '' with the non - dominant polarity .",
    "of course , this is also a highly simplified situation when compared to the real sun , for which there are often network concentrations of both polarities even in strongly unipolar coronal holes .    as described above , at the beginning of each time step there is a set of field lines traced from each of the flux elements .",
    "these @xmath190 field lines are used to estimate the instantaneous fractions of absolute unsigned flux that are either open or closed .",
    "the fraction of flux that is open is denoted @xmath204 , and in figure [ fig09 ] we show its mean value as a function of the @xmath24 imbalance ratio .",
    "this fraction is never exactly the same from one time step to the next , and the error bars show @xmath157 standard deviations about the mean values . on average",
    ", @xmath204 is roughly equal to @xmath24 itself .",
    "in other words , models with balanced fields tend not to have much open flux , but when there is an increase in the unbalanced component of the field there is a corresponding increase in the fraction of open flux .",
    "figure [ fig09 ] also compares the modeled values of @xmath204 with observational determinations of this quantity from @xcite , and there is a similar trend of direct proportionality , with @xmath205 .",
    "we studied the time evolution of magnetic topology in the bones simulations by following the opening and closing of flux tubes from the beginning to the end of each time step . for comparison",
    ", we also computed the recycling time scale for flux to emerge from below the photospheric surface ( see also section [ sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "we defined this quantity as @xmath206 for our models we took @xmath133 from figure [ fig03 ] and @xmath34 from equation ( [ eq : efit ] ) , and we found that the emergence time scale @xmath207 tends to have values around 12 hr ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "regions of extreme flux imbalance undergo slower emergence , with @xmath207 exceeding 1020 hr when @xmath208 .",
    "figure [ fig10](a ) shows the @xmath24 dependence of this time scale .",
    "next we used the flux tubes traced in our simulations to investigate the time scales for magnetic field evolution in the corona .",
    "@xcite performed a similar study in the limit of a balanced field , with @xmath29 .",
    "they computed a so - called _ coronal flux recycling time _ that is meant to characterize a local rate of change of the coronal field .",
    "this rate is driven both by reconnection and by topological evolution of the complex `` hierarchical tree '' of footpoint domains in the magnetic carpet . because changes in the coronal field can take place even without any flux emergence or cancellation",
    ", @xcite found that coronal flux recycling times can be significantly shorter than photospheric flux recycling times .",
    "changes in topological connections can occur purely as a result of the horizontal motions of flux elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used an older photospheric flux recycling time of @xmath209 hr , but they found that the coronal flux recycling time can be as short as 1.4 hr .",
    "when emergence and cancellation were suppressed , the coronal time scale was approximately a factor of two larger ( @xmath423 hr ) but still much more rapid than @xmath207 .",
    "our models differ from those of @xcite in that our photospheric emergence time scale is now of the same order of magnitude as their coronal recycling time scale .",
    "below we describe how we estimate how long it takes for _ just the open flux _ to recycle itself in the corona .",
    "we do not track the ( possibly more numerous ) changes in topology that do not involve open flux tubes . as summarized in section [ sec:5.1 ] , over the course of a time step some of the flux in the model",
    "is unaccounted for because it has either emerged since the last time step or it has evolved beyond recognition as the same flux element .",
    "the remaining fraction of total absolute flux  i.e . , that which survives the time step unaltered  is called @xmath210 , and figure [ fig09 ] shows how its mean value increases steadily from about 0.82 to 0.95 as @xmath24 increases from 0 to 1 . a larger choice for the relative tolerance parameter @xmath187 would give a larger survival fraction @xmath210 ( see below ) , but",
    "it can be argued that too much tolerance would give rise to errors in how flux tubes are identified and tracked .    for flux tubes that survive a time step relatively unchanged , we compared the endpoints of the field lines traced at the beginning and end of the time step .",
    "the fluxes in these field lines are summed into four separate bins that are defined by their connectivity .",
    "the four bins correspond to four fractions of the total surviving absolute flux : @xmath211 ( starts open , ends open ) , @xmath212 ( starts open , ends closed ) , @xmath213 ( starts closed , ends open ) , and @xmath214 ( starts closed , ends closed ) . because the overall magnetic configuration of the system does not vary strongly over a single time step , we found that @xmath215 .",
    "also , the two fractions that denote change ( @xmath212 and @xmath213 ) both tend to be small contributors to the total .",
    "the mean values of @xmath213 in the models tend to vary between about 0.005 and 0.025 , with the largest values occurring for intermediate imbalance ratios of @xmath216 and the smallest values occurring at the extremes of @xmath29 and 0.99 .",
    "we also note that the time averages of @xmath213 and @xmath212 are always roughly equal to one another ( as should be required for a time - steady dynamical equilibrium ) . for all 11 models , the time averages of these two fractions never differ from one another by more than about 2% .    at any one time , we define the amount of open ( absolute ) flux density as @xmath217 .",
    "we computed the instantaneous rate of opening in each time step @xmath41 as @xmath218 note that the above definition makes the implicit assumption that @xmath213 is the fraction of the _ total _ absolute flux density in the simulation that opens up in one time step .",
    "however , this fraction is only approximately @xmath210 times the total absolute flux that opens up .",
    "we assumed that the small fraction @xmath219 that was not counted contributes in the same way as the larger fraction @xmath210 that was counted .",
    "( this assumption is tested below . )",
    "thus , the mean time scale for the opening up of closed flux tubes is @xmath220    because the quantities @xmath213 and @xmath221 can be quite variable from time step to time step , we realized that care should be taken in computing the averages in equation ( [ eq : tauco ] ) .",
    "we ended up computing these averages in two independent ways .",
    "first , we took simple arithmetic averages of the time series for @xmath221 and the other quantities .",
    "second , we integrated the rate defined in equation ( [ eq : dbdtco ] ) as a function of time to build up the _ cumulative _ amount of flux density that is opened up over the course of the simulation .",
    "this is a monotonically increasing function , but its increase with time is intermittent because different amounts of flux are opened up in each time step .",
    "we fit the cumulative growth of opened flux density with a linear function , and then used the slope of this linear fit as the mean value of @xmath221 .",
    "these two methods gave results that agreed with one another to within about 10% , and we used the latter technique for all values reported below .",
    "figure [ fig10](a ) compares the above time scales with one another .",
    "it is clear that @xmath222 in these models . in other words , the time scale for the replacement of the photospheric flux  via emergence from below  is the same as the time scale for replacement of the open flux that feeds the solar wind . at first glance",
    ", this appears to be a simple requirement for a time - steady equilibrium , in the same way that @xmath223 is required to maintain a steady state .",
    "however , one can imagine situations where the rate of flux evolution in the corona is not so strongly coupled to the emergence rate of new flux from below ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case , it is the use of potential fields  which are remapped during each time step with no allowance for the storage of free energy in the corona  that demands @xmath222 . in other words ,",
    "the bones models reproduce the case of highly efficient magnetic reconnection , where the corona `` processes '' the flux as quickly as it is driven ( stressed or injected ) from below .",
    "one can imagine that in a full mhd simulation the efficiency of magnetic reconnection may not be so high , and thus the resulting non - potential , current - filled corona should exhibit @xmath224 .",
    "note that figure [ fig10](a ) does not show the value of @xmath225 for the @xmath29 model .",
    "as equation ( [ eq : tauco ] ) makes clear , in this case both the numerator and denominator are numbers that should approach zero .",
    "ideally , there should be no open fields at all in a _",
    "perfectly _ balanced potential field .",
    "the bones models do in fact give slightly nonzero values for @xmath226 and @xmath227 , but these are believed to be numerical artifacts arising from the discrete nature of the field - line tracing technique .",
    "we reiterate that we do not compute the time scale for _ all _ of the coronal flux to be recycled . that recycling time should be nonzero even for the balanced @xmath29 model @xcite . in all models with @xmath228 ,",
    "the full coronal recycling time is likely to be significantly shorter than @xmath225 .    in order to study the dependence of our results on the assumptions made about flux - tube identification",

    "@xmath187 away from its default value of 0.1 , in a range between 0 and 0.5 .",

    "table 1 shows several resulting parameters of the test simulations , which were all performed for @xmath229 . as we expected , the flux survival fraction @xmath210 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath187 .",
    "however , there does not seem to be any definitive trend with @xmath187 in the fraction of flux that opens up ( @xmath213 ) , the related time scale for flux opening ( @xmath225 ) , or the energy flux released by reconnection into open - field regions ( @xmath230 , see section [ sec:5.5 ] ) .",

    "if a significant amount of solar wind plasma flows out during the time it takes the open field to reorganize itself via reconnection , then the reconnection processes themselves probably _ are not responsible _ for producing the majority of the solar wind .",
    "the rlo idea depends on the plasma in open flux tubes coming from the opening up of closed loops .",
    "thus , we want to determine whether or not a large amount of mass accelerates out in the open flux tubes over the time it would take for significant mass to be processed via loop - opening .",
    "the time scale for wind acceleration from a lower height @xmath236 in the solar transition region ( tr ) to an arbitrary upper height @xmath237 is @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the radial wind speed .",

    "we used the one - fluid solar wind models of @xcite to compute @xmath240 , and we defined @xmath236 as the height at which the temperature in a wind model first reaches @xmath241 k.    figure [ fig10](b ) shows the wind acceleration time scales for several representative upper heights @xmath237 , and for a range of models of the fast and slow wind that have speeds at 1 au between 400 and 750 km s@xmath38 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "two side - by - side plots are necessary in figure [ fig10 ] because there is not a unique one - to - one correspondence between the flux imbalance ratio @xmath24 and the wind speed at 1 au .",
    "we do know , however , that there is some association between slow wind streams and qs regions on the surface ( @xmath242 ) and between fast wind streams and ch regions on the surface ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "thus , the overall left - to - right variations in the two panels can be roughly associated with one another .",
    "the slow solar wind models shown in figure [ fig10](b ) have the shortest acceleration time scales . given equation ( [ eq : tauwind ] ) , this is potentially counterintuitive .",
    "however , we note that the slow wind models from @xcite often have local maxima in @xmath239 of order 100 km s@xmath38 in the low corona that are not present in the more steadily accelerating fast wind models ( see also figure 7a of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these regions correspond to enhanced magnetic fields that were included to simulate open fields at the edges of streamers and active regions .",
    "observations are beginning to show hints of such rapid outflows as well @xcite .",
    "when comparing the time scales for flux opening and solar wind acceleration , we can use the loop heights illustrated in figure [ fig07 ] as an order - of - magnitude guide for the maximum height @xmath237 to use when computing @xmath244 .",
    "for example , when parcels of solar wind exceed a height that is 23 times @xmath199 , it can be safely assumed that the wind has left behind virtually all interactions with closed loops and should be considered to be freely accelerating .",
    "this allows us to compare the time scales between panels in figure [ fig10 ] for the two general types of solar wind :    1 .   for slow wind streams rooted in balanced qs regions (",
    "i.e. , @xmath242 ) , the height at which the wind flows `` free and clear '' of loops is of order 50100 mm .",
    "figure [ fig10](b ) shows that this height corresponds to @xmath2450.3 hr .",
    "this is a shorter time scale than the representative flux - opening time @xmath246 hr that corresponds to the left side of figure [ fig10](a ) , but it is still of the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus , it is possible that rlo processes could be important for slow wind acceleration .",
    "2 .   for fast wind streams rooted in unbalanced ch regions ( i.e. , @xmath243 )",
    ", the height corresponding to 23 times @xmath199 is only of order 515 mm .",
    "the fast wind accelerates to this range of heights in less than about 0.3 hr , but the flux - opening recycling time in coronal holes can be as long as 310 hr . this is a larger discrepancy than in the case of the slow wind , and it implies that it is unlikely that rlo processes are important in accelerating the bulk of the fast wind .",
    "( of course , it still may be the case that rlo processes produce a highly intermittent or episodic injection of mass and energy into the fast wind in coronal holes  just not enough to affect the majority of the accelerating plasma .",

    "the shape of the gray region is roughly independent of wind speed and @xmath24 .",
    "this is because , as one goes from left to right in the plot , the increase in @xmath240 ( for constant @xmath237 ) is offset by the fact that the relevant value of @xmath237 decreases ( because @xmath199 decreases ; see figure [ fig07 ] ) .",
    "finally , we reiterate that the values of @xmath225 shown in figure [ fig10](a ) are likely to just be lower limits to the actual time scales of flux - opening . as discussed above",
    ", our models assume a succession of potential fields that are consistent with the assumption of rapid magnetic reconnection .",
    "if the true mhd state of the corona exhibits less efficient magnetic reconnection , then the photospheric footpoint stressing will build up non - potential fields and current sheets in the corona and thus give rise to larger net values of @xmath225 . in this case",
    ", it is even more certain that @xmath247 , and our conclusion that rlo processes are unimportant in accelerating the solar wind is strengthened .",
    "our primary reason for constructing the bones simulations was to estimate how much energy is deposited into the solar wind by the evolving magnetic carpet .",
    "first , though , it is necessary to compute how much magnetic energy is being injected into the system from below the photosphere .",

    "this gives a reliable upper limit that is independent of the adopted geometry and topology of the emerging flux elements .",
    "observationally , the poynting flux can be estimated from various measured proxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "first , we note that the emergence rate @xmath34 ( equation ( [ eq : efit ] ) ) already describes how much magnetic flux is driven up from below the photosphere , per unit area and per unit time ( i.e. , its units are mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 ) . what we want to know is how much magnetic energy emerges , in units of erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "thus , if we can relate the flux in an emerging bipole to its magnetic energy , we can convert easily from @xmath34 to @xmath252 . treating a pair of equal - and - opposite emerging flux elements as an an ideal ( but partially submerged ) magnetic _ dipole ,",
    "_ we can specify its field strength as @xmath258 where @xmath164 is the absolute flux in each pole , @xmath73 is the horizontal separation between the two poles , @xmath259 is the distance measured from the center of the dipole , and @xmath260 is the polar angle measured from the ( horizontal ) dipole axis . assuming the dipole is submerged at a depth @xmath261 , it is possible to integrate the magnetic energy @xmath262 over the full coronal volume @xmath263 ( i.e. , over all @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and all @xmath264 ) analytically .",
    "we thus found @xmath265 note that the magnetic energy above the photosphere is extremely sensitive to the submerged depth @xmath261 .",
    "once the magnetic energy due to a given bipole is known , we can estimate the magnitude of the poynting flux as @xmath266 where the angle brackets denote the properties of the `` average '' emerging bipole as discussed in section [ sec:3.2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig11](a ) shows this quantity for the 11 models as a function of @xmath24 , and for two reasonable choices of @xmath261 ( 0.8 and 1.2 mm ) . for typical values of @xmath267 mx cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath63 mx , @xmath268 mm , and @xmath269 mm , we find that @xmath270 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .    the second way to estimate @xmath252 was proposed by @xcite . here , we compute the total magnetic energy in the system ( per unit surface area ) and divide it by the flux recycling time . in other words , @xmath271 here , the value of @xmath272 at the photospheric surface is essentially the time - averaged absolute flux density ( i.e. , @xmath273 ) .",
    "it is the height - dependence of @xmath272 , for @xmath274 , that is the major source of uncertainty in evaluating equation ( [ eq : sdef2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is straightforward to follow @xcite and assume a vertical falloff that depends on a power of heliocentric radius .",
    "thus , @xmath275 ( where @xmath276 ) , and then @xmath277 at large distances above the photosphere , the exponent @xmath65 approaches a value of 2 , but it is believed to take on larger values closer to the surface ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a typical value of @xmath278 g and @xmath279 hr , we can estimate an upper limit on @xmath252 by assuming @xmath280 , and thus obtain @xmath281 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 . for a more realistic coronal value of @xmath282",
    ", we have @xmath283 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "figure [ fig11](a ) shows how @xmath252 varies as a function of @xmath24 when the modeled variations in @xmath133 and @xmath207 are used , and when the two above values of @xmath284 and 8 are assumed to define the lower and upper limiting cases .",
    "given the uncertainties , the two alternate methods of estimating @xmath252 give numerical values that are quite consistent with one another .",
    "we used the output of the bones simulations to estimate the amount of energy released by magnetic reconnection for cases of closed flux tubes turning into open flux tubes ( and vice versa ) .",
    "it is important to note that there are also expected to be many _ other _ sites of reconnection and energy release that do not involve open flux tubes .",
    "for example , in a balanced qs region there may be a large number of small - scale `` footpoint - swapping '' events that start with a configuration of closed loops and end with a slightly different topological distribution of closed loops @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explicitly ignore the energy release in the closed  closed events in order to focus on only the subset of events that can input mass and energy into the solar wind .",
    "the basic geometrical picture for a flux - opening event is the `` anemone '' type structure that is believed to exist at the footpoints of many x - ray bright points , coronal jets , and polar plumes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture , a small bipolar magnetic field either emerges or advects into the presence of a larger - scale open field .",
    "magnetic reconnection is believed to occur roughly above the end of the bipole with the opposite polarity as the open field @xcite .",
    "the newly opened flux may take the form of a jet or plume @xcite , and the newly closed flux may `` subduct '' and provide heating to the underlying chromosphere @xcite . in one of these interchange - reconnection type events",
    ", the amount of closed magnetic flux that opens up should be the same as the amount of pre - existing open flux that becomes closed ( i.e. , @xmath223 ) .",
    "because we model the evolution of the coronal magnetic field as a succession of potential fields ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) , we use the quasi - static `` minimum current corona '' ( mcc ) model to estimate the energy loss due to reconnection @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the mean energy flux released in closed - to - open reconnection events is proportional to the rate @xmath221 at which magnetic flux is opened up ( see equation ( [ eq : dbdtco ] ) ) . for our simulations , we derived the mcc energy flux to be @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the mean absolute flux per element , @xmath287 is the mean separation between elements in the simulation , and @xmath288 and @xmath289 are dimensionless constants .",
    "the appendix presents a detailed derivation of equation ( [ eq : fco ] ) for anemone - type reconnection events , including a discussion of the most likely numerical values for @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "it is important to clarify that the energy flux given by equation ( [ eq : fco ] ) is meant to be an order - of - magnitude representation of the magnetic `` free energy '' released by reconnection .",
    "the mcc model depends on an estimate of the current that builds up and is dissipated along an idealized separator , and truly non - potential mhd simulations are needed to verify whether these estimates are valid .",
    "also , the mcc model does not specify how the energy is partitioned into other forms such as thermal energy , bulk kinetic energy , waves , mhd turbulence , and energetic particles . determining this partitioning is a complex problem  one definitely beyond the scope of this paper  that often requires the use of fully kinetic simulations .",
    "however , it has been found that many forms of particle energization that occur rapidly and locally in reconnection regions may eventually become unstable to dissipation that randomizes the velocity distributions @xcite .",
    "thus , much of the energy that initially goes into , e.g. , waves or supra - alfvnic beams may end up released in the form of heat .",
    "this will be our implicit assumption when comparing @xmath290 with the energy fluxes required to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind along open flux tubes .",
    "figure [ fig11](a ) shows the time - averaged quantities @xmath230 for 10 of the standard bones models as a function of @xmath24 ( excluding the case @xmath56 ) .",
    "see below for a discussion of how @xmath290 varies in time .",
    "the lower and upper sets of points were computed by assuming the product of the two dimensionless constants @xmath291 to be 0.003 and 0.011 , respectively ( see the appendix ) . for nearly all of the models , @xmath230 is significantly smaller than the available poynting flux @xmath252 . for the lowest values of @xmath24 , the resulting `` efficiency '' of energy release in open - field regions ( i.e. , @xmath292 ) may be as low as 0.0010.01 .",
    "this means that in qs regions , only a tiny fraction of the magnetic energy that enters the system ends up being available for driving the solar wind via rlo processes .    for most values of @xmath24 , the computed values of @xmath230 are significantly lower than the canonical heat fluxes ( i.e. , @xmath293 to @xmath255 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 ) that @xcite estimated are needed to maintain qs and ch regions on the sun",
    "however , for the most unbalanced ch regions ( @xmath294 ) the modeled energy fluxes do appear to approach both the empirically required heating rates and the empirically constrained poynting fluxes . observed coronal holes , however , exhibit values of @xmath24 over a much wider range of values @xcite , so the models still have a problem with explaining ch coronal heating in general .",
    "figure [ fig11](a ) also shows a curve that represents a linear dependence with the flux imbalance ratio ; i.e. , @xmath295 . for @xmath296 ,",
    "this linear relationship appears to fit the variation in the modeled energy fluxes .",
    "because we also know that @xmath297 ( see figure [ fig09 ] ) , this tells us that the heating rate in flux - opening events is roughly proportional to how much of the time - averaged magnetic field remains open .",
    "as was done in section [ sec:5.3 ] above , we can also compare the results from the bones simulations with earlier models of solar wind acceleration along open flux tubes .",
    "we would like to assess how much energy flux needs to be deposited in open - field regions in order to produce the solar wind .",
    "we used the one - fluid wtd - type models of @xcite to estimate this quantity .",
    "these models involved finding a self - consistent description of the volumetric heating rate @xmath298 ( in units of erg @xmath299 s@xmath38 ) that was able to maintain time - steady corona and solar wind . in order to derive the total energy flux @xmath300 that was dissipated in one of these models , we had to integrate over the entire radial grid , which extended from the photosphere to the heliosphere .",
    "the @xcite models were computed along magnetic flux tubes that have a radially varying cross - sectional area @xmath301 .",
    "thus , the radial integral of the product @xmath302 gives the total power dissipated ( in erg s@xmath38 ) in a flux tube . to express this quantity as an energy flux and compare it to the quantities shown in figure [ fig11](a ) , we normalized the area function @xmath301 to the area of the simulation box ( @xmath303^{2}$ ] ) at a height corresponding to the low corona , at which the supergranular funnels have expanded to fill the `` canopy '' volume . for the @xcite models , this height corresponds to @xmath304 mm .",
    "then the energy flux can be computed by dividing the total power by the box area @xmath31 , and @xmath305 figure [ fig11](b ) shows how @xmath306 depends on the wind speed at 1 au for the same models that were shown in figure [ fig10](b ) .",
    "we point out that @xcite was correct to conclude that the energy flux _ needed _ to accelerate",
    "the solar wind is of the same order of magnitude as the emerging poynting flux @xmath252 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , figure [ fig11](a ) shows that rlo - type flux - opening events do _ not _ appear to be able to release the required energy flux into the open flux tubes .",
    "a key result of many coronal heating models  including the mcc models of @xcite  is that the energy dissipation process should be highly intermittent .",
    "this occurs in the bones simulations as well .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows a snapshot of the time dependence of the quantity @xmath290 for the @xmath192 and 0.8 models .",
    "these heating rates were computed with the upper - limit value of the product @xmath307 .",
    "thus , the time averages of these quantities correspond to the upper set of solid points in figure [ fig11](a ) . for the majority of the models ( @xmath296 ) the standard deviation of @xmath290 is approximately half of its mean value . for the extreme models with the lowest and highest values of @xmath24 , the standard deviations increase to be about equal to their means .",
    "such a scaling would be expected if the energy fluxes were sampled from an _ exponential distribution _ similar in form to that of the emerging bipole fluxes ( equation ( [ eq : probe ] ) ) . in any case",
    ", the variability of the predicted heating rates may be just as useful as the mean values when attempting to distinguish between different coronal heating models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to list some of the ways in which the above models may be incomplete or incorrect . for example ,    1 .",
    "the assumption of a succession of potential fields is likely to limit the verisimilitude of the models .",
    "it is clear that time dependent , three - dimensional mhd models  which contain currents , resistivity , and finite - pressure effects  would shed more light on the dynamics and energetics of this system . if the gas pressure in localized reconnection regions begins to exceed the magnetic pressure ( i.e. , @xmath308 ) , there may be additional ways for the flux tubes to `` break open '' that were not accounted for here .",
    "2 .   even within the confines of a succession of potential fields ,",
    "the assumptions of the mcc model may be too simplistic .",
    "for example , it is known that in three - dimensional reconnection there are both spatial and temporal variations of the current _ along _ separators , which our implementation of mcc does not include ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our assumption of @xmath309 in equation ( [ eq : fco ] ) may be too large , and thus our resulting estimate for the energy flux released by reconnection may be too high .",
    "the simple three - pole magnetic geometry discussed in the appendix did not consider realistic asymmetries in either the footpoint locations or the magnitudes of the flux sources .",
    "when such asymmetries are included @xcite , the resulting range of values for @xmath289 would likely be different .",
    "it is unclear whether @xmath289 would be larger or smaller than the values estimated in the appendix .",
    "the use of the mean flux element separation @xmath287 in equation ( [ eq : fco ] ) is only a rough approximation .",
    "since there may be significant energy release when one flux element gets very close to another , it may be better to use a mean distance that is smaller than @xmath287 . in that case , our estimate for the heating rate could be too low . 6 .",
    "as we mentioned in section [ sec:5.1 ] above , many of the flux tubes that are classified as `` open '' may in fact be closed in the form of hydrostatic helmet streamers . in reality , then , the energy flux that escapes out into the solar wind could be even lower than the values of @xmath230 that were shown in figure [ fig11](a ) .",
    "it is also possible that large - scale interchange reconnection could eventually open up these flux tubes @xcite , but modeling those processes is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "roughly speaking , there appear to be just as many reasons why our results for the rates of rlo heating and flux - opening may be overestimates as there are reasons why they may be underestimates . despite the approximate nature of these models",
    ", however , we believe that the main result ( i.e. , @xmath310 for most values of @xmath24 ) is not likely to be wrong by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the primary aim of this paper was to begin testing the conjecture that the opening up of closed flux in the sun s magnetic carpet is responsible for driving the solar wind .",
    "first , we created monte carlo simulations of the complex photospheric sources of the solar magnetic field .",
    "the resulting time - averaged properties of the models appeared to agree well not only with observations of the flux density and the flux imbalance ratio , but also with observed probability distributions for the flux elements and autocorrelation functions of the field strength . a supergranular pattern of network magnetic concentrations appeared spontaneously in the models , despite the lack of any imposed supergranular motions .",
    "then , armed with some degree of confidence that the model photosphere is an adequate reflection of reality , we then computed the coronal magnetic field . assuming that the coronal field evolves as a succession of potential - field extrapolations , we were able to estimate both the time scales and energy fluxes associated with rlo - type flux - opening events .    from the simulations",
    ", we found that the poynting flux in emerging magnetic elements ( which could be a proxy for the maximum energy flux available for coronal heating ) is typically around @xmath257 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "however , for quiet regions ( @xmath311 ) , only a tiny fraction of the available poynting flux was found to be released in flux - opening events via magnetic reconnection .",
    "a similar situation was found to exist in mixed - polarity regions that can correspond to either quiet sun or coronal holes ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "for the most unbalanced coronal hole regions ( @xmath243 ) , the fraction of poynting flux released in flux - opening events may approach unity . in these regions , however , the time scale for flux opening was found to be significantly longer than the solar wind travel time from the coronal base to heights far above the tops of loops .",
    "thus , it appears that a significant amount of mass accelerates out into the solar wind over the time that it would take for the plasma to be processed via rlo type mechanisms . from the above estimates of time scales and mcc energetics ,",
    "we conclude that _ it is unlikely that the solar wind is driven by reconnection and loop - opening processes in the magnetic carpet . _    despite the negative conclusion regarding the solar wind as a whole , we believe that the physical processes modeled in this paper are likely to be relevant in many other ways . for example , it is possible that more can be learned about the energetics of _ polar jets _ with the methodology developed here .",
    "soft x - ray observations can be used to estimate the energy flux released due to jet eruptions .",
    "these jets are believed to span several orders of magnitude in the total amount of energy released ; i.e. , between about @xmath312 and @xmath313 erg @xcite .",
    "let us take a canonical value of @xmath314 erg from the model of @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite identified 104 jets with the _ hinode _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) over a time span of 44 hours in a polar coronal hole , which gives a mean time between jets ( for the observed area ) of @xmath315 s. the area examined by @xcite was approximately the `` front half '' of the polar cap , viewed from the side , which extended down to about 25 colatitude and thus covered about @xmath316 cm@xmath88 .",
    "thus , we estimate the mean energy flux released in jets to be @xmath318 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with the predicted energy fluxes ( for @xmath3190.9 ) shown in figure [ fig11](a ) .",
    "the flux - opening events modeled in this paper may also be relevant to understanding the small eruptions seen in quiet regions @xcite that may be related to coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "however , it is not guaranteed that every jet - like eruption observed in the corona releases material that accelerates up into the solar wind .",
    "there is observational evidence that at least some coronal jets contain plasma that falls back down because it failed to reach the escape speed @xcite .",
    "this may put some jets into the same category as spicules , which are known to carry orders of magnitude more mass up ( and down ) than is needed to feed the solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a potentially valuable set of observational diagnostics of the processes discussed in this paper are the elemental abundances and ionization states of different particle species that escape into the solar wind @xcite .",
    "the closed - to - open reconnection events that we have modeled may inject some plasma with a distinctly `` closed '' composition signature into regions that have signatures otherwise dominated by flux tubes that remain open .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that there remains disagreement about exactly what kinds of abundance and ionization signatures signal the presence of closed loops , and which do not .",
    "@xcite showed that a range of wtd - type open - flux - tube models can produce values of the commonly measured o@xmath320/o@xmath321 and fe / o ratios that agree reasonably well with in  situ measurements ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we question the popular assertion that the charge - state and first - ionization - potential ( fip ) properties measured in the slow solar wind can only be explained by the injection of plasma from closed - field regions on the sun .    whether or not the solar wind energy budget is accounted for by rlo processes ,",
    "the inherent _ variability _ in the magnetic carpet is likely to cause some kind of mhd fluctuations to propagate up into the corona .",
    "the response of the coronal field to the evolving footpoints may result in alfvn waves with periods of order @xmath322 ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggested that `` flux cancellation '' events in the corona may be the most likely source of the long - period ( i.e. , 0.510 hour ) alfvn waves that dominate in  situ measurements .",
    "the statistical properties of these low - frequency fluctuations may also be consistent with an origin in the motions of coronal field - line footpoints @xcite .    in order to further test the applicability of rlo - type processes to accelerating the solar wind ,",
    "the models need to evolve beyond the approximate potential - field `` skeleton '' and to incorporate mhd effects .",
    "multi - dimensional mhd simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) illustrate the aspects of coronal reconnection that are  and are not  modeled well by potential fields , and future studies need to account for these effects more consistently .",
    "also , analytic models of the micro - scale kinetic physics should be developed further in order to complement the coarser - gridded numerical simulations .",
    "ideas such as stochastic growth theory @xcite or non - modal stability @xcite may be useful ways to understand the partitioning of energy within reconnection regions .",
    "additional work should be done to refine and test the idea that the supergranular network is the natural by - product of smaller - scale granular activity @xcite .",
    "our success in reproducing the measured autocorrelation patterns in magnetograms ( see figure [ fig05 ] ) does not necessarily imply that there is no convective component to supergranulation .",
    "however , our results do appear to provide evidence that at least _ some _ of the 1030 mm magnetic structure on the sun can be built up from @xmath421 mm granulation effects via a kind of diffusion - limited aggregation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "another topic that requires further study is the coupling between waves and flux emergence in the granular convective flows at the photospheric lower boundary .",
    "@xcite estimated that the surface - averaged energy flux of alfvn waves in the low corona is of order @xmath255 erg cm@xmath13 s@xmath38 ( see figure 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "it is probably not a coincidence that this is of the same order of magnitude as the poynting flux @xmath252 due to the emergence of ephemeral regions .",
    "the interplay between convective overturning motions , colliding granular cells , and thin flux tubes may give rise to a rough equipartition between these different sources of energy . by constructing models that contain the seeds of _ both _ wtd and rlo processes",

    "the motions of discrete flux sources on the solar surface give rise to stresses in the coronal field that are concentrated at topological boundaries ( i.e. , separatrix surfaces and separator field lines ) .",
    "electric currents are assumed to form along the separators , and then dissipate as magnetic reconnection occurs in response to the evolution of the flux domains .",
    "@xcite found that the power dissipated in a single flux transfer event must be choppy and intermittent , but its time average can be written as @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the time derivative of magnetic flux that is in the process of transferring its connectivity , @xmath325 is a characteristic current that is assumed to flow along the separator , @xmath288 is a dimensionless threshold constant describing the intermittency of reconnection , and @xmath326 is the speed of light in vacuum .    in the double - bipole configuration of @xcite ,",
    "the transfer of magnetic flux ( @xmath324 ) occurred because a fraction of the flux from the positive pole of one bipole became reconnected with the negative pole of the other bipole . in our model , we consider the transfer of flux from a closed flux tube to an open flux tube , or from open to closed .",
    "equation ( b9 ) of @xcite gave the characteristic current used in equation ( [ eq : longpower ] ) above . correcting a typographical error in @xcite , this current",

    "the above equations let us estimate the power emitted from the loss of magnetic free energy via reconnection .",

    "these building blocks can then be assembled together in a statistical way to account for the total amount of evolving flux in each time step of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite described a simple model of plume / jet events in coronal holes that involved only three discrete flux sources : two that form a localized bipole and a third that represents a unipolar source of open field .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec:5.5 ] , the energy release that is assumed to occur in this system happens when some of the flux in the bipole reconnects with the unipolar region , giving rise to an equal amount of opening and closing of flux ( @xmath333 ) . for geometric simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that all three flux sources are collinear along the @xmath3 axis , with a negative source in between two positive sources .",
    "the flux evolution occurs as the negative pole of the bipole moves away from its original positive partner and towards the positive source of open field .",
    "we want to evaluate the properties of this system at a representative time in the middle of its evolution , so let us posit an additional symmetry ; i.e. , we assume that the negative pole sits at the origin ( @xmath334 ) and the two positive poles are both equidistant from the origin ( @xmath335 ) and of equal positive flux .",
    "this may be an extreme simplification , since it is known that many details of three - dimensional null - point reconnection do depend on whether the geometry is symmetric or asymmetric @xcite .",

    "the _ separator field line _ is the intersection of the two separatrix surfaces , and for this model it is a semicircle in the @xmath4@xmath237 plane .    in order to solve equation ( [ eq : jacobian ] ) we need to evaluate the exact position of the separator .",
    "first , we locate its maximum height @xmath344 by looking for the height of the magnetic null point along the vertical line denoted by @xmath334 and @xmath345 .",
    "we use equations ( [ eq : btrix])([eq : btriz ] ) to solve for the magnitude of the magnetic field strength , but we do not worry about its absolute normalization . along the vertical line in question , @xmath346 , and we find that @xmath347 we set @xmath348 and search for a nontrivial solution for @xmath349 . this is a cubic polynomial equation , and figure [ fig13](b ) shows the numerical solution for the ratio @xmath350 as a function of @xmath341 .",
    "solutions exist only for @xmath351 .",
    "due to the symmetry in our assumed system , the separator field line is confined to the plane @xmath334 , and it subtends a semicircular shape for @xmath352 .",
    "thus , the separator obeys @xmath353 , its length is @xmath354 , and we can use the geometrical factor @xmath330 in equation ( [ eq : istar ] ) .",
    "we estimate the average value of @xmath331 along the separator by just computing its value at the maximum height ( @xmath355 , @xmath356 ) . at this point ,",
    "the field s parallel direction points along the @xmath4 axis , so equation ( [ eq : jacobian ] ) can be written @xmath357 the cross - derivatives in the second term are found to be zero , and it can be shown that @xmath358 where @xmath359 @xmath360 and @xmath361 .",
    "the two dimensionless factors given in equations ( [ eq : cxx ] ) and ( [ eq : czz ] ) are related to equation ( [ eq : bperp ] ) via @xmath362 figure [ fig13](b ) shows the dimensionless factor @xmath363 as a function of the flux imbalance ratio @xmath341 .",
    "the above model gives us the ability to write the average power dissipated ( equation ( [ eq : longpower ] ) ) as @xmath364 where the dimensionless factors dependent on @xmath341 have been collected into a single constant @xmath365 figure [ fig13](b ) shows that @xmath289 varies less strongly as a function of @xmath341 than either of its components . in our models",
    ", we will not keep track of the individual @xmath341 imbalance ratios for each reconnection event .",
    "instead we adopt a _ range _ of values for @xmath289 that spans the majority of the variation for many likely @xmath341 values .",
    "the gray region in figure [ fig13](b ) shows this range of values ; the lower limit is 0.003 , and the upper limit is the maximum value of 0.011 .",
    "the other dimensionless constant in equation ( [ eq : longpower ] ) is @xmath288 .",
    "this parameter is a threshold ratio of the instantaneous current density to the characteristic current @xmath325 , and in the mcc model it is assumed that plasma instabilities ( e.g. , the ion - acoustic instability or tearing - mode instabilities ) will limit the growth of the current to some fraction of @xmath325 .",
    "@xcite argued that @xmath366 was reasonable to expect , and he ended up using @xmath367 in the initial mcc models .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found that some situations appear to demand larger values of order @xmath368 .",
    "we will use the latter value , but we will keep in mind that the resulting heating rate may be an upper limit .    to apply the heating rate derived above to our monte carlo models ,",
    "we note that equation ( [ eq : dbdtco ] ) gives the time derivative of magnetic flux that is being opened up in the simulation box , during each time step . in order to solve equation ( [ eq : avgpower ] ) ,",
    "however , we also need to know the characteristic fluxes in the elements that are interacting , as well as their inter - element distances .",
    "since many reconnection events may be occurring simultaneously in each time step , we must use _ averages _ taken over the box area .",
    "we also divide both sides of equation ( [ eq : avgpower ] ) by @xmath31 in order to express the heating rate per unit area in terms of the variations in magnetic flux density .",
    "thus , @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the mean absolute flux per element in the simulation box , and @xmath371 is the mean separation between flux elements .",
    "this is the form of the mcc energy flux used for the bones results presented in section [ sec:5.5 ] .",

    "<S> the models agree with observed emergence rates , surface flux densities , and number distributions of magnetic elements . despite having no imposed supergranular motions in the models , a realistic network of magnetic `` funnels '' appeared spontaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we computed the rate at which closed field lines open up ( i.e. , recycling times for open flux ) , and we estimated the energy flux released in reconnection events involving the opening up of closed flux tubes . </S>",
    "<S> for quiet regions and mixed - polarity coronal holes , these energy fluxes were found to be much lower than required to accelerate the solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> for the most imbalanced coronal holes , the energy fluxes may be large enough to power the solar wind , but the recycling times are far longer than the time it takes the solar wind to accelerate into the low corona . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is unlikely that either the slow or fast solar wind is driven by reconnection and loop - opening processes in the magnetic carpet . </S>"
