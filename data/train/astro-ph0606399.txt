    "at the first protostars and planets conference in 1978 , the existence of circumstellar disks around sun  like stars was in doubt , with most researchers preferring the hypothesis that young stellar objects were surrounded by spherical shells of material unlike the solar nebula thought to give rise to the solar system ( _ rydgren et al .",
    "_ , 1978 ) .",
    "by the time of protostars and planets ii , experts in the field had accepted that young stars were surrounded by circumstellar disks though the evidence was largely circumstantial ( _ harvey _ , 1985 ) . at that meeting , fred gillett and members of the iras team announced details of newly discovered debris disks , initially observed as part of the calibration program ( _ aumann et al .",

    ", it was well  established that many stars are born with circumstellar accretion disks ( _ strom et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) and at ppiv , it was recognized that many of these disks must give rise to planetary systems ( _ marcy et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) . over the last 15 years",
    ", debris disks have been recognized as playing an important role in helping us understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( _ backman and paresce _ , 1993 ; _ lagrange et al . _ , 2000",
    "; see also _ zuckerman _ , 2001 ) .",
    "after ppiv , several questions remained .",
    "how do debris disks evolve around sun  like stars ?",
    "when do gas  rich disks transition to debris disks ?",
    "can we infer the presence of extra  solar planets from spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and/or resolved disk morphology ?",
    "is there any connection between debris disks and the radial velocity planets ?",
    "is there evidence for differences in disk evolution as a function of stellar mass ?    in answering these questions , our objective is no less than to understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems through observations of the gas and dust content of circumstellar material surrounding stars as a function of stellar age . by observing how disks dissipate from the post  accretion phase through the planet building phase we can hope to constrain theories of planet formation ( cf .",
    "chapters by _ durisen et al . _ and _ lissauer and stevenson _ ) . by observing",
    "how debris disks generate dust at late times and comparing those observations with physical models of planetary system dynamics , we can infer the diversity of solar system architectures as well as attempt to understand how they evolve with time .    today , we marvel at the wealth of results from the spitzer space telescope and high contrast images of spectacular individual systems .",
    "detection statistics that were very uncertain with iras and iso sensitivity now can be compared with models of planetary system evolution , placing our solar system in context .",
    "advances in planetary system dynamical theory , the discovery and characterization of the kuiper belt ( see chapter by _ chiang et al . _ ) have proceeded in parallel and further contribute to our understanding of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "we attempt to compare observations of disks surrounding other stars to our current understanding of solar system evolution .",
    "our ultimate goal is to learn whether or not solar systems like our own are common or rare among stars in the disk of the milky way and what implications this might have on the frequency of terrestrial planets that might give rise to life .",
    "our plan for this contribution is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe recent results from observational surveys for gas and dust surrounding normal stars .",
    "next we describe detailed studies of individual objects in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we review modeling approaches used in constraining physical properties of disks from the observations .",
    "section 5 describes a toy model for the evolution of our solar system which we use to compare to the ensemble of observations .",
    "finally , in section 6 we attempt to address whether or not planetary systems like our own are common or rare in the milky way galaxy and summarize our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the evolution of circumstellar disks astronomers are forced to observe sun  like stars at a variety of ages , in an attempt to create a history , hoping that on average , a younger population of similar mass stars can be assumed to be the evolutionary precursors of the older . although deriving ages of stars across the h ",

    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "however , these results are based largely on the presence of near  infrared excess emission which only traces optically  thick hot dust within 0.1 au of the central star .",
    "indeed the presence of an inner disk appears to correlate with the presence or absence of spectroscopic signatures of active accretion onto the star ( _ hartigan et al .",

    "_ , 1998 ) , the fraction of young stars in clusters that show evidence for optically ",
    "thick inner disks diminishes . yet",
    "what is often overlooked is that the very data that suggest a typical inner disk lifetime of @xmath0 3 myr , also _ suggests a dispersion of inner disk lifetimes from 110 myr_.    what has remained unclear until recently is how these primordial disks left over from the formation of the young star dissipate at larger radii and whether the termination of accretion represents an end of the gas  rich phase of the circumstellar disk . even at the time of ppiii , it was recognized that young stars ( with ages @xmath1 3 myr ) lacking optically  thick near  infrared excess emission but possessing optically ",

    "it is important to distinguish between surveys for primordial disks , gas and dust rich disks left over from the star formation process , and debris disks , where the opacity we see is dominated by grains released through collisions of larger parent bodies .",
    "often this distinction is made based on whether remnant gas is left in the system . with a gas to dust ratio @xmath2 1.0 ,",

    "work has been used to determine the specific incident energy required to catastrophically destroy a particle , @xmath20 .",
    "this energy depends on particle composition , as well as the relative velocity of the collision ( @xmath21 ) , but to a greater extent is dependent on the size of the target .",
    "it is found to lie in the range @xmath22 j kg@xmath23 , which means that for collision velocities of @xmath24 km s@xmath23 particles are destroyed in collisions with other particles that are at least @xmath25 times their own size , @xmath26 .",
    "the collision velocity depends on the eccentricities and inclinations of the particles orbits , the mean values of which may vary with particle size after formation ( e.g. , _ weidenschilling et al . _ ,",
    "for planetesimal growth to occur both have to be relatively low @xmath27 to prevent net destruction of particles . however",
    "to initiate a collisional cascade something must have excited the velocity dispersion in the disk to allow collisions to be catastrophic .",
    "models which follow the collisional evolution of planetesimal belts from their growth phase through to their cascade phase show that this switch may occur after the formation of a planet sized object ( _ kenyon and bromley _ , 2002a , 2004 ) or from excitation by a passing star ( _ kenyon and bromley _ , 2002b ) .",
    "a particle s collisional lifetime is the mean time between catastrophic collisions .",
    "this can be worked out from the catastrophic collision rate which is the product of the relative velocity of collisions and the volume density of cross - sectional area of the impactors larger than @xmath28 . for the smallest particles in the distribution , for which collisions with any other member of the distribution is catastrophic ,",
    "their collisional lifetime is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the orbital period and @xmath31 is the surface density of cross - sectional area in the disk which when multiplied by the absorption efficiency of the grains gives the disk s face  on optical depth ( _ wyatt and dent _ , 2002 ) .",
    "larger particles have longer collisional lifetimes .    in an infinite collisional cascade",
    "in which the outcome of collisions is self - similar ( in that the size distribution of collision fragments is independent of the target size ) , collisions are expected to result in a size distribution with @xmath32 ( _ dohnanyi _ , 1969 ; _ tanaka et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) .",
    "such a distribution has most of its mass in the largest planetesimals , but most of its cross - sectional area in the smallest particles .",
    "_ radiation pressure and p - r drag _ small grains are affected by their interaction with stellar radiation which causes a force on the grains which is parameterized by @xmath6 , the ratio of the radiation force to stellar gravity .",
    "this parameter depends on the size of the grain , and to a lesser extent on its composition . for large particles @xmath6",

    "however , this relation breaks down for particles comparable in size to the wavelength of stellar radiation for which a value of @xmath6 is reached which is independent of particle size ( _ gustafson _ , 1994 ) .",
    "the radial component of the radiation force is known as radiation pressure . for grains with @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) , which corresponds to sub - micron sized grains near a sun - like star",
    ", radiation pressure causes the grains to be blown out of the system on hyperbolic trajectories as soon as they are created .",
    "since grains with @xmath41 have no force acting on them , the blow - out timescale can be estimated from the orbital period of the parent planetesimal : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the semimajor axis of the parent in au , and @xmath44 is the time to go from a radial distance of @xmath43 to @xmath45 . in the absence of any further interaction , such grains have a surface density distribution that falls off @xmath46 .    the tangential component of the radiation force in known as poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag .",

    "such grains have a surface density distribution that is constant with the distance from the star .    _",
    "other processes _ other physical processes acting on dust in debris disks range from gas drag to stellar wind drag , lorentz forces on charged grains and sublimation .",
    "many of these have been determined to be unimportant in the physical regimes of debris disks .",
    "however , it is becoming clear that for dust around m stars the force of the stellar wind is important both for its drag component ( _ plavchan et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) and its pressure component ( _ strubbe and chiang _ , in press ) .",
    "gas drag may also be important in young debris disks .",
    "while the quantity of gas present is still poorly known , if the gas disk is sufficiently dense then gas drag can significantly alter the orbital evolution of dust grains .",

    ", 2001 ; _ klahr and lin _ , 2001 ; _ ardila et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; _ takeuchi et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) . for @xmath6 pic",
    "it has been estimated that gas drag becomes important when the gas to dust ratio exceeds 1 ( _ thbault and augereau _ , 2005 ) .",
    "a debris disk that is not subjected to the stochastic mass  loss processes discussed in sections 4.4 and 5 , will evolve in steady  state losing mass through radiation processes acting on small grains : through p - r drag and consequently evaporation close to the star , or through collisional grinding down and consequently blow - out by radiation pressure .",
    "the competition between collisions and p - r drag was explored in _ wyatt _",
    "( 2005 ) which modeled the dust distribution expected if a planetesimal belt at @xmath50 is creating dust of just one size ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . the resulting distribution depends only on the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "if the disk is dense ( @xmath52 ) , then collisions occur much faster than p - r drag and the dust remains confined to the planetesimal belt , whereas if the disk is tenuous ( @xmath53 ) then the dust suffers no collisions before reaching the star and the dust distribution is flat as expected by p - r drag .",
    "while this is a simplification of the processes going on in debris disks , which are creating dust of a range of sizes , it serves to illustrate the fact that disks operate in one of two regimes : collisional or p - r drag dominated .",
    "these regimes are discussed in more detail below .",
    "_ collisionally dominated disks _ in a collisionally dominated disk ( @xmath52 ) it is possible to ignore p - r drag , since the cumulative migration of particles over all generations from planetesimal to @xmath7m - sized grain is negligible ( e.g. , _",
    "wyatt et al . _ , 1999 ) .",
    "this is because p - r drag lifetimes increase @xmath54 , whereas collisional lifetimes increase @xmath55 ( assuming the distribution of eq .",
    "[ eq : nd ] ) meaning that the migration undergone before a collision becomes vanishingly small for large particles .",
    "there are two components to a collisionally dominated debris disk : dynamically bound grains at the same radial location as the planetesimals , and unbound grains with an @xmath56 distribution beyond that .",
    "the short lifetime of the unbound grains ( eq .  [ eq : tbl ] ) suggests that their number density should be extremely tenuous , and should fall below that expected from an extrapolation of the collisional cascade distribution .",
    "however , recent observations indicate that in some imaged debris disks they are being replenished at a rate sufficient for these grains to dominate certain observations ( e.g. , _ telesco et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; _ augereau et al . _ , 2001 ; _ su et al . _ , 2005 ) , implying a comparable cross - sectional area in these particles to that in bound grains as currently observed .    the size distribution in a collisionally dominated disk varies somewhat from that given in eq .",
    "[ eq : nd ] , since that assumes an infinite collisional cascade .",
    "if the number of blow - out grains falls below that of the collisional cascade distribution , then since these particles would be expected to destroy particles just larger than themselves , their low number causes an increase in the equilibrium number of particles just above the blow - out limit .",
    "this in turn reduces the equilibrium number of slightly larger particles , and so on ; i.e. , this causes a wave in the size distribution which continues up to larger sizes ( _ thbault et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand larger quantities of blow - out grains are present ( e.g. , because their number is enhanced by those driven out from closer to the star ) , then this can actually reduce the equilibrium number of particles just above the blow - out limit ( _ krivov et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "the long term evolution of a collisionally dominated disk was considered by _ dominik and decin _ ( 2003 ) .",
    "they considered the case where the dust disk is fed by planetesimals of a given size , @xmath57 , and showed how collisions cause the number of those planetesimals , @xmath58 , to follow : @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the collisional lifetime of the colliding planetesimals at @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , the evolution is flat until the disk is old enough for the majority of the planetesimals to have collided with each other ( i.e. , when @xmath62 ) , thus eroding their population , at which point their number falls off @xmath63 . since the size distribution connecting the dust to the number of planetesimals is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : nd ] , it follows that the cross - sectional area of emitting dust has the same flat or @xmath64 evolution as does the total mass of material in the disk which is dominated by planetesimals of size @xmath57 .",
    "_ dominik and decin _ ( 2003 ) also noted ways of changing the evolution , e.g. , by introducing stirring .",
    "the quantity of blow - out grains in the disk does not follow the same evolution , since their number is determined by the equilibrium between the rate at which the grains are created and that at which they are lost ( eq .",
    "[ eq : tbl ] ) . the rate at which they are created depends on details of the physics of collisions , but since the rate at which dust is produced by planetesimals is @xmath65 , it follows that their population should fall off @xmath66 or @xmath9 depending on whether @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "_ p - r drag dominated disks _ a conclusion shared by _ dominik and decin _ ( 2003 ) and _ wyatt _",
    "( 2005 ) is that none of the debris disks detected with current instrumentation is in the p - r drag dominated regime .",
    "( 2005 ) explained this as a consequence of the fact that such disks are of too low mass for their emission to be comparable to that of the stellar photosphere .",
    "thus the detection of such disks requires calibration to a few % in the mid- to far - ir , or discovery in the sub - mm .",
    "however , the zodiacal cloud ( and presumably dust from the kuiper belt ) in the solar system is a good example of a p - r drag dominated disk .",
    "it is not possible to completely ignore collisions in a p - r drag dominated disk , since , while the smallest dust makes it to the star without suffering a collision , the largest grains are in a collisionally dominated regime , with intermediate sizes having distributions closer to that of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "matters are complicated by the way p - r drag affects the size distribution .",
    "if collisional processes in a planetesimal belt are assumed to create dust at a rate that results in the size distribution of eq .",
    "[ eq : nd ] in the planetesimal belt , then since small dust migrates faster than small dust ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : beta ] and [ eq : tpr ] ) then the size distribution of the dust affected by p - r drag should follow @xmath70 ( _ wyatt et al . _ , 1999 ) , a distribution in which most of the cross - sectional area is in the largest particles in that distribution .",
    "in other words , the cross - sectional area should be dominated by grains for which p - r drag and collisional lifetimes are roughly equal , with that size varying with distance from the planetesimal belt .",
    "this reasoning is in agreement with observations of the size distribution of interplanetary dust in the vicinity of the earth ( _ love and brownlee _ , 1993 ; _ wyatt et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; _ grogan et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "_ dominik and decin _ ( 2003 ) also looked at the evolution of p - r drag dominated disks within the model described above .",
    "they concluded that the quantity of visible grains should fall off @xmath71 .",
    "perhaps the most important discovery about debris disks is the fact that there are inner holes in their dust distribution .",
    "it is often suggested that planet - sized bodies are required interior to the inner edge of the debris disk to maintain the inner holes , because otherwise the dust would migrate inward due to p - r drag thus filling in the central cavity ( _ roques et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) .",
    "it is certainly true that a planet could maintain an inner hole by a combination of trapping the dust in its resonances ( _ liou and zook _ , 1999 ) , scattering the dust outward ( _ moro - martin and malhotra _ , 2002 ) , and accreting the dust ( _ wyatt et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) . however , a planet is not required to prevent p - r drag filling in the holes in the detected debris disks , since in dense enough disks collisional grinding down already renders p - r drag insignificant ( _ wyatt _ , 2005 ) .",
    "what the inner holes do require , however , is a lack of colliding planetesimals in this region .",
    "one possible reason for the lack of planetesimals close to the star is that they have already formed into planet - sized objects , since planet formation processes proceed much faster closer to the star ( _ kenyon and bromley _ , 2002 ) .",
    "any remaining planetesimals would then be scattered out of the system by chaos induced by perturbations from these larger bodies ( e.g. , _ wisdom _ , 1980 ) .",
    "much of our understanding of debris disks stems from our understanding of the evolution of the zodiacal cloud .",
    "this was originally assumed to be in a quasi steady - state .",
    "however , models of the collisional evolution of the asteroid belt , and the dust produced therein , showed significant peaks in dust density occur when large asteroids collide releasing quantities of dust sufficient to affect to total dust content in the inner solar system ( _ dermott et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) .",
    "further evidence for the stochastic evolution of the asteroid belt came from the identification of asteroid families created in the recent ( last few myr ) break - up of large asteroids ( _ nesvorn et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) .",
    "the link of those young families to the dust band features in the zodiacal cloud structure ( _ dermott et al . _ , 2002 ) and to peaks in the accretion rate of @xmath72he by the earth ( _ farley et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) confirmed the stochastic nature of the inner solar system dust content , at least on timescales of several myr .",
    "more recently the stochastic nature of the evolution of debris disks around a stars has been proposed by _",
    "rieke et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) based on the dispersion of observed disk luminosities .",
    "several debris disks are observed to have small grains ( with very short lifetimes ) at radii inconsistent with steady - state configurations over the lifetime of the star ( e.g. , _ telesco et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; _ song et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; _ su et al . _ , 2005 ) .    the arguments described previously considered the steady - state evolution of dust created in a planetesimal belt at single radius .",
    "the same ideas are still more generally applicable to stochastic models , since a situation of quasi - steady state is reached relatively quickly at least for small dust for which radiation and collision processes balance on timescales of order 1 myr ( depending on disk mass and radius ) .",
    "stochastic evolution of the type seen in the zodiacal cloud arises from the random input of dust from the destruction of large planetesimals . whether it is possible to witness the outcome of such events in extrasolar debris disks is still debated for individual objects .",
    "this is unlikely to be the case for dust seen in the sub - mm , since the large dust mass observed requires a collision between two large planetesimals ( @xmath73 km for dust seen in fomalhaut ) , and while such events may occur , the expected number of such objects makes witnessing such an event improbable ( _ wyatt and dent _ , 2002 ) .",
    "observations at shorter wavelengths ( and closer to the star ) probe lower dust masses , however , and these observations may be sensitive to detecting such events ( _ telesco et al . _ , 2005 ; _ kenyon and bromley _ , 2005 ) .",
    "debris disk evolution may also be affected by external influences .",
    "one such influence could be stirring of the disk by stars which pass by close to the disk ( _ larwood and kalas _ , 2001 ; _ kenyon and bromley _ , 2002b ) .",
    "however , the low frequency of close encounters with field stars means this can not account for the enhanced dust flux of all debris disk candidates , although such events may be common in the early evolution of a disk when it is still in a dense cluster environment .",
    "another external influence could be the passage of the disk through a dense patch of interstellar material which either replenishes the circumstellar environment with dust or erodes an extant , but low density debris disk ( _ lissauer and griffith _",
    ", 1989 ; _ whitmire et al . _ , 1992 ) .",
    "other explanations which have been proposed to explain sudden increases in dust flux include the sublimation of supercomets scattered in close to the star ( _ beichman et al . _ , 2005 ) .",
    "it is also becoming evident that the orbits of the giant planets have not remained stationary over the age of the solar system ( _ malhotra _ , 1993 ; _ gomes et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "the recently investigated stochastic component of giant planet orbital evolution can explain many of the features of the solar system including the period of late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) which rapidly depleted the asteroid and kuiper belts , leading to enhanced collision rates in the inner solar system .",
    "such an event in an extrasolar system would dramatically increase its dust flux for a short period , but would likely do so only once in the system s lifetime .",
    "a similar scenario was also proposed by _",
    "thommes et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) to explain the lhb wherein the giant cores that formed between jupiter and saturn were thrown outwards into the kuiper belt by chaos at a late time .",
    "again this would result in a spike in the dust content of an extrasolar system .",
    "these ideas are applied to own solar system in the next section .",
    "our asteroid belt ( ab ) and kuiper - edgeworth belt ( kb ) contain planetesimals that accreted during the earliest epochs of the solar system s formation , plus fragments from subsequent collisions ( e.g. , _ bottke et al .",

    "collisions in both belts should generate populations of dust grains analogous to extrasolar debris disks .",

    "internal \" collisional processes followed by radiation pressure - driven removal of small fragments is responsible for depletion of either belt .",
    "persistence of basaltic lava flows on vesta s crust is evidence that the ab contained no more than 0.1 m@xmath5 6 myr after the first chondrules formed ( _ davis et al .",
    "_ , 1985 ; _ bottke et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "this implies a factor of at least 40x depletion of the ab zone s mass by that time , impossible for purely collisional evolution of the original amount of material ( reviewed by _",
    "bottke et al . _ , 2005",
    "section 4 of this chapter ) . also , the present ab collisional  pseudo - age \" , i.e.  the model time scale for a purely self - colliding ab to reach its present density , is of order twice the current age of the solar system .",
    "this is further indication that the ab s history includes significant depletion processes other than comminution .",
    "proposed depletion mechanisms include sweeping of secular resonances through the ab as the protoplanetary disk s gas dispersed ( _ nagasawa et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) and as jupiter formed and perhaps migrated during the solar system s first 10 myr or so ( _ bottke et al . _ , 2005 ) .",
    "similarly , several investigators have concluded that the primordial kb was depleted by outward migration of neptune that swept secular resonances through the planetesimal population , tossing most of the small objects either inward to encounter the other planets or outward into the kb s  scattered disk \" .",
    "that scenario neatly explains several features of the present kb in addition to the mass depletion ( _ levison and morbidelli _ , 2003 ; _ gomes et al . _ , 2005",
    "; see the chapter by _",
    "levison et al . _ ) . this substantial re - organization of the solar system could have waited a surprisingly long time , as much as 1.0 gyr , driven by slow evolution of the giant planets orbits before becoming chaotic ( _ gomes et al . _ ,",
    "the timing is consistent with the epoch of the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) discerned in lunar cratering record .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "strom et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) point out that , because jupiter should have migrated inward as part of the same process driving neptune outward , the ab could have been decimated ( perhaps for the second time ) at the same late era as the kb .",
    "the simple model employed herein to track the history of the solar system s ir sed involves calculating the collisional evolution of the ab and kb .",
    "each belt is divided into 10 radial annuli that evolve independently . at each time step (",
    "generally set to 10@xmath78 years ) for each annulus is calculated : ( 1 ) the number of parent body collisions , ( 2 ) the fragment mass produced and subtracted from the parent body reservoir , and ( 3 ) mass lost via  blowout \" of the smallest particles plus p - r drift from the belt inward toward the sun .",
    "parent body collisions are considered only statistically so the model has no capacity to represent  spikes \" from occasional large collisions as discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "mass in grains that would be rapidly ejected via radiation pressure  blowout \" is removed from the model instantaneously when created . if the collision timescale for bound grains of a given size and location is shorter than the p ",
    "r removal time , those grains are not allowed to drift interior to the belt and contribute to the inner zodiacal cloud .",
    "thus , based on the theory explained in the previous section , if the belt fragment density is above a certain threshold , the net mass loss is only outward via direct ejection , not inward .",
    "the terrestrial planets are not considered as barriers to p - r drift but neptune is assumed able to consume or deflect all grains , so the model dust surface density is set to zero between 4 and 30 au .",
    "the system sed is calculated using generic grain emissivity that depends only on particle size .",
    "an indication that the model works well is that it naturally predicts the observed zodiacal dust density as the output from the observed ab large - body mass and spatial distributions without fine - tuning .",
    "our simple results agree with _ bottke et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) and others conclusion that the ab and kb must both have been subject to depletions by factors of 10 - 100 sometime during their histories because simple collisional evolution would not produce the low - mass belts we see today .",
    "the present ab and kb masses can not be produced from the likely starting masses without either ( a ) an arbitrary continuous removal of parent bodies with an exponential time scale for both belts of order 2 gyr , shown in fig 5 ( top ) , or ( b ) one sudden depletion event shown in fig 5 ( bottom ) , which involves collisionally evolving the starting mass for 0.5 gyr , then reducing each belt mass by amounts necessary to allow collisional evolution to resume and continue over the next 4.0 gyr to reach the observed low masses of the two belts .",
    "the toy model scenario a simply predicts that a planetary system would have significant 10 - 30 @xmath7 m flux up to an age of 1 gyr .",
    "the general lack of observed mid - ir excesses in spitzer targets older than 30 myr could mean : a ) most systems do not have belts at temperatures like our asteroid belt , or b ) most have lhb - like events earlier in their histories .",
    "a corollary of the present depleted ab having a large - body collision time scale of 10 gyr is that the ab / zodi system is nearly constant in time ( e.g. , equation 6 ) .",
    "thus , extrapolating backward by _ dominik and decin _ ( 2003 ) t@xmath23 or t@xmath79 scaling laws is inappropriate ( cf .",
    "our model predicts that the ab / zodi and kb ir luminosities both would only decrease by about 30 % in 4.0 gyr after the lhb or equivalent major clearing .",
    "this agrees with the lunar cratering record indicating that the ab , the earth - crossing asteroid population , and the zodiacal cloud have had nearly constant density for at least the past 3.0 gyr .    in another chapter , _ levison et al . _",
    "discuss the idea that our planetary system had a traumatic re - organization about 700 myr after its formation .",
    "an intriguing extension of this idea is that extrasolar debris disk systems that seem brighter than their age cohorts may represent lhb - like events , i.e.collisions of small bodies excited by planet migration that can occur late in a system s development at a time determined by details of the original planetary system architecture .",
    "our  toy \" model results compared with spitzer observations ( e.g. , _ kim et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) support a picture in which many systems evolve according to the principles articulated by _ dominik and decin _ ( 2003 ) unless interrupted by an lhb event that might occur almost any time in the system s history .",
    "after the lhb event the system is nearly clear of planetesimals and dust and evolves very slowly .",
    "it remains to be seen whether observations with spitzer can distinguish between hypotheses such as single super - collisions or late episodes of debris belt clearing .",
    "based on the discussions presented above , it is clear that the question of how common solar systems like our own might be , depends in part on what radius in the disk one looks and at what age the comparison is made .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows : 1 ) warm circumstellar material inside of 1 au dissipates rapidly on timescales comparable to the cessation of accretion ; 2 ) the gas content of disks much older than 10 myr is incapable of forming giant planets ; 3 ) while massive analogues to our asteroid belt lacking outer disks appear to be rare overall ( 13 % ) , warm disks ( lacking inner hot dust ) seem to enjoy a preferred epoch around stars with ages between 10300 myr old ; 4 ) cold outer disks ( analogous to our own kuiper belt , but much more massive ) are found around 1020 % of sun  like stars ; 5 ) resolved images of disks are crucial in order to remove degeneracies in debris disk modeling from seds alone ; 6 ) most debris disks observed to date are collisionally dominated dust systems and do not require the dynamical action of planets to maintain the observed inner holes ; 7 ) at least some disks are observed in a short  lived phase of evolution and are not examples of the most massive debris disks ; and 8) comparing the ensemble of observations of disks surrounding other stars as a function of age to the evolution of our solar system requires detailed understanding of its dynamical evolution including the late  heavy bombardment era . yet in affecting these comparisons , we must remember that we do not yet have the sensitivity to observe tenuous debris disks comparable to our own asteroid belt or our kuiper belt .",
    "it is unclear whether debris systems significantly more massive ( and therefore more easily detectable ) than our own represent a more or less favorable condition for planet formation .",
    "it may be that systems with planets might arise from disks with higher mass surface density and thus stronger debris signatures at early times than disks lacking planets .",
    "however , if events comparable to the dynamical re  arrangement of our solar system ( perhaps related to the lunar late  heavy bombardment ) are common in planetary systems within the first few hundred million years we might expect that debris disks lacking planets might be brighter than those with planets at late times . _",
    "beichman et al . _",
    "( 2005a ) present preliminary evidence that there may be some connection between the presence of a massive debris disk and a radial velocity planet within 5 au .",
    "it is interesting to note that extrapolations of the detection frequency of extra  solar planets as a function of radius beyond current survey limits ( see chapter by _ udry et al .",

    "main sequence stars are more massive than their lower mass t tauri counter  parts .",
    "_ muzerolle et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) also show that disk accretion rates appear to correlate with stellar mass .",
    "historically , debris disks have been more commonly associated with a stars rather than g or m stars , but that has been largely attributable to a selection effect : it is easier to see smaller amounts of dust surrounding higher luminosity objects in flux",
    " limited surveys .",
    "_ rieke et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) present evidence for a diminution in the frequency of mid  ir excess emission surrounding a stars over 100300 myr .",
    "their data indicate that over and above an evelope of decay consistent with a t@xmath23 fall off , several objects show evidence for greater dust generation rates consistent with their interpretation of stochastic processes in planetesimal disks ( see sections 3 and 4 above ) . in general , the overall picture of a star debris disk evolution is remarkably consistent with that presented for sun  like stars suggesting that stellar mass does not play a defining role in debris disk evolution .",
    "in contrast , primordial disks around higher mass stars are more massive , and have shorter lifetimes ( _ hillenbrand et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; _ lada et al .",
    "_ , in press ) , than disks around lower mass stars .",
    "_ greaves et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) also present evidence from iso observations concerning the frequency of debris disks as a function of mass .",
    "they find that debris surrounding a stars is more common than around g stars , even for stars of the same age ( though the observations were sensitive to different amounts of debris as a function of stellar luminosity ) .",
    "they suggest that the difference is due to characteristic lifetimes of debris becoming an increasing fraction of of the main sequence lifetime for higher mass ( shorter lived ) stars , possibly because disk mass correlates with star mass .",
    "_ plavchan et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) present a survey for warm inner debris surrounding young m dwarfs .",
    "they explain their lack of detections , which is contrary to expectations from the timescale for p ",
    "r drag as a function of stellar luminosity , due to the effects of an enhanced particulate wind from late  type stars compared to early  type stars .",
    "yet , it is clear from recent work on low mass stars and brown dwarfs that they too possess primordial circumstellar disks when they are young ( see chapter by _ luhman et al .",
    "_ ; _ apai et al . _ , 2005 ) however their evolutionary properties are as yet unclear .",
    "spitzer studies of debris disks surrounding low mass stars and brown dwarfs at longer wavelengths are now underway . combining data on a stars , g dwarfs , and m dwarfs , there is , to date , no evidence for wildly divergent evolutionary histories for debris disks as a function of stellar mass averaged over main sequence lifetimes .",
    "observed differences to date can be explained in part by differences in dust mass upper limits as a function of stellar luminosity and assuming that the typical star to initial disk mass is roughly constant .",
    "it is important to remember that most _ sun  like _ stars in the disk of milky way are binary ( _ duquennoy and mayor _ , 1991 ) , while the binary fraction of low mass stars and brown dwarfs may be lower ( see chapter by _ burgasser et al . _ ) .",
    "it is clear that the evolution of disks in the pre ",
    "main sequence phase can be influenced by the presence or absence of a companion ( see chapter by _ monin et al . _ ; _ jensen et al . _ , 1996 ) .",
    "preliminary results from spitzer suggest that debris disk evolution is not a strong function of multiplicity , and may even be enhanced in close binaries ( _ trilling et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "what are the implications for the formation of terrestrial planets in disks surrounding stars of all masses in the disk of the milky way ? we know that primordial accretion disks commonly surround very young stars ( approaching 100 % ) , and that gas  rich disks around more ( less ) massive stars are bigger ( smaller ) , but last shorter ( longer ) amounts of time .",
    "because of the surface density of solids in the disk , more massive disks surrounding higher mass stars will probably form planetesimals faster .",
    "what is unclear is whether disks surrounding intermediate mass stars ( with shorter gas disk lifetimes ) retain remnant gas needed to damp the eccentricities of forming planetesimals to create planetary systems like our own ( _ kominami and ida _ , 2002 ) . yet",
    "the planetesimal growth time in disks surrounding low mass stars and brown dwarfs might be prohibitive given the low surface densities of solids ( see however _ beaulieu et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) .",
    "perhaps , just like goldilocks , we will find that terrestrial planets in stable circular orbits are found in abundance around sun  like stars from 0.33 au .",
    "whether these planets have liquid water and the potential for life as we know it to develop will depend on many factors ( see chapter by _ gaidos and selsis _ ) . as results from spitzer and other facilities continue to guide our understanding in the coming years",
