    "reactions on surfaces play an important role in many technological applications like the heterogenous catalysis , growth of semiconductor devices , corrosion and lubrication of mechanical parts , or hydrogen storage in metals . in spite of this significance",
    "the understanding of the microscopic details of these reactions is still rather incomplete .",
    "of particular importance are processes in which chemical bonds of molecules are breaking due to the presence of a substrate because there processes represent the first elementary step in , e.g. , heterogeneous catalysis or corrosion .",
    "often this is the rate - limiting step , for example in the ammonia synthesis .",
    "hydrogen dissociation on metal surfaces has become _ the _ model system for the bond - breaking process on surfaces in the last years because it can be studied in detail experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "in particular in the theoretical description there has been much progress recently due to the improvement of computer power and the development of efficient algorithms .",
    "it has become possible to map out detailed potential energy surfaces of the dissociation of hydrogen on metal surfaces by density functional theory calculations @xcite .",
    "the availability of high - dimensional reliable potential energy surfaces has challenged the dynamics community to improve their methods in order to perform high - dimensional dynamical studies on these potentials .",
    "now quantum studies of the dissociation of hydrogen on surfaces are possible in which all six degrees of freedom of the molecule are treated dynamically @xcite . in this brief review",
    "i will illustrate this progress by focusing on the hydrogen dissociation on the clean and sulfur - covered palladium surface .",
    "hydrogen is the simplest molecule which makes it accessible to a relatively complete theoretical treatment . at the same time hydrogen",
    "is also well - suited for performing experiments which allows a fruitful interaction between theory and experiment .",
    "i will show that general concepts relating to the reactivity of surfaces as well as to dynamical reaction mechanisms can be deduced from the detailed comparison of theoretical and experimental results of the hydrogen dissociation of metal surfaces .",
    "these concepts are applicable to any reaction system making hydrogen the ideal candidate for studying reactions on surfaces .",
    "the sticking or adsorption probability is defined as the fraction of atoms or molecules impinging on a surface that are not scattered back , i.e. that remain on the surface .",
    "it should be noted here that there is no unambiguous definition of the sticking probability because for surfaces with non - zero temperature every adsorbed particle will sooner or later desorb again .",
    "hence the sticking probability depends on the time - scale of the required residence time on the surface .",
    "atomic adsorption is often very efficient .",
    "hydrogen atoms , e.g , stick at metal surfaces @xcite and semiconductor surfaces @xcite with a probability of order unity .",
    "however , dissociative adsorption probabilities can differ by many orders of magnitude . whereas the sticking probability of hydrogen molecules on many transition metal surfaces is about 0.5 @xcite , at room temperature the dissociation probability of h@xmath0/si",
    "is only 10@xmath1 @xcite , and for n@xmath0/ru it is even as low as 10@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the investigation of processes that occur within such a wide range of probabilities represents of course a great challenge for the theory as well as for the experiment .",
    "( 10,6.5 ) ( -1.,0 . )    there is one fundamental difference between atomic and molecular adsorption on the one side and dissociative adsorption on the other side that is very important for the theoretical description of these processes .",
    "here with molecular adsorption a sticking process is meant in which the molecule stays intact on the surface .",
    "this fundamental difference will be illustrated in the following . in atomic and molecular adsorption",
    "it is crucial that the impinging particles transfer their kinetic energy to the surface , otherwise they would be scattered back into the gas phase . if @xmath3 is the probability that an incoming particle with kinetic energy @xmath4 will transfer the energy @xmath5 to the surface , then the atomic or molecular sticking probability can be expressed as @xmath6 i.e. , it corresponds to the fraction of particles that transfer more energy to the surface than their initial kinetic energy .",
    "this excess energy has to be transferred to substrate excitation , i.e. , either phonons or electron - hole pairs .",
    "hence any theoretical description of atomic or molecular adsorption has to consider dissipation to the continous excitation spectrum of the substrate . in fig .",
    "[ mol_ads ] sticking probabilities for atomic and molecular adsorption as a function of the initial kinetic energy are shown that correspond indeed to textbook examples @xcite .",
    "these curves show a typical behavior , namely the decrease of the sticking probability with increasing kinetic energy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the energy transfer to the surface becomes less efficient at higher kinetic energies .",
    "of course , the higher the kinetic energy is , the more energy is transfered to the surface .",
    "but the fraction of particles that loose more energy than their initial kinetic energy becomes smaller at higher kinetic energy .",
    "there is still more interesting physics in these sticking probabilities .",
    "for example , at low kinetic energies classically the sticking probability should become unity if there is no barrier before the adsorption well .",
    "every impinging particle transfers energy to the substrate so that in the limit of zero initial kinetic energy all particles will stick .",
    "quantum mechanically , however , there is a non - zero probability for elastic scattering at the surface so that the sticking probabilities become less than unity in the zero - energy limit @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ mol_ads ] these quantum effects at low energies are evident in the sticking probability of the light noble gas argon on pt(111 ) compared to the sticking probability of the heavier noble gas xenon on the same surface .",
    "( 10,6.5 ) ( -1.,0 . )    now in the case of dissociative adsorption there is another channel for energy transfer , which is the conversion of the kinetic and internal energy of the molecule into translational energy of the atomic fragments on the surface relative to each other .",
    "this represents the fundamental difference to atomic or molecular adsorption .",
    "it is true that eventually the atomic fragments will also dissipate their kinetic energy and come to rest at the surface .",
    "however , especially in the case of light molecules like hydrogen dissociating on metal surfaces the energy transfer to the substrate is very small due to the large mass mismatch . whether a molecule sticks on the surface or not is almost entirely determined by the bond - breaking process for which the energy transfer to the substrate can be neglected",
    "this makes it possible to describe the dissociative adsorption process within low - dimensional potential energy surfaces neglecting the surface degrees of freedom if furthermore no substantial surface rearrangement upon adsorption occurs , as it is usually case in the dissociative adsorption on close - packed metal surfaces . fig .  [ diss_ads ] shows the dissociative adsorption probability of a system which also corresponds to a textbook example , namely the dissociative adsorption of h@xmath0 on cu(111 ) . in this system",
    "the dissociation is hindered by a noticeable barrier so that the dependence of the sticking probability on the kinetic energy exhibits a behavior typical for activated systems @xcite .",
    "transition metal surfaces are usually very reactive as fas as hydrogen dissociation is concerned @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ h2pdstick ] the results of molecular beam experiments of rendulic , anger and winkler @xcite and of rettner and auerbach @xcite for the dissociative adsorption of h@xmath0 on pd(100 ) are shown . at low kinetic energies",
    "these experiments yield a sticking probability above 0.5 . but",
    "even more interestingly , the sticking probability initially decreases with increasing kinetic energy .",
    "this is reminiscent of the dependence of the sticking probability on the kinetic energy in atomic or molecular adsorption illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mol_ads ] .",
    "therefore for a long time it was believed that such an initially decreasing sticking probability in dissociative adsorption is a signature of the so - called precursor mechanism @xcite . in this mechanism",
    "the molecule does not directly dissociate but is first trapped molecularly in a precursor state from which it then dissociates . this trapping probability decreases with increasing kinetic energy and thus determines the sticking at low kinetic energies .",

    "[ h2pdelbow ] two so - called elbow plots are shown .",
    "they represent a two - dimensional cut through the potential energy surface ( pes ) of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) in which the orientation of the molecule , its center - of - mass lateral coordinates and the substrate are kept fixed .",
    "the molecule is oriented parallel to the surface , and the pes is plotted as a function of the center - of - mass distance of the molecule from the surface @xmath7 and the interatomic distance @xmath8 .",
    "[ h2pdelbow]a demonstrates that the dissociation of h@xmath0 on pd(100 ) is non - activated , i.e. , there are reaction paths towards dissociative adsorption with no energy barrier . the majority of reaction pathways , however , is hindered by barriers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in these calculations no molecular adsorption state has been found .",
    "it looks like there is such a well in fig .",
    "[ h2pdelbow]b .",
    "however , the detailed dft study of the pes has shown that this apparent well does not correspond to a local minimum of the pes , it is rather a saddle point in the multi - dimensional pes .    an analytical representation of this _ ab initio _ pes has been used for a quantum dynamical study in which all six hydrogen degrees of freedom were taken into account explicitly while the substrate was kept fixed @xcite .",
    "the results are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ h2pdstick ] .",
    "the sticking curve for a monoenergetic beam initially in the vibrational and rotational ground state shows a strong oscillatory structure which will be discussed below .",
    "an experimental molecular beam , however , does not correspond to a monoenergetic beam in one specific quantum state . if one assumes an energy spread and a distribution of internal molecular states typical for a beam experiment , the oscillations are almost entirely smoothed out in the 6d quantum results ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ h2pdstick ] ) .",
    "the results corresponding to the beam simulation agree with the experimental results semi - quantitatively .",
    "more importantly , they reproduce the general trend found in the experiment , namely the initial decrease of the sticking probability as a function of the kinetic energy followed by an increase at higher energies .",
    "now in the _ ab initio _ pes there is no molecular adsorption state , furthermore in the 6d quantum dynamical calculation no energy transfer to the substrate is considered .",
    "hence the precursor mechanism can not be operative in the simulation .",
    "so what is the reason for the initial decrease of the sticking probability ?",
    "since energy transfer can not play a crucial role in the adsorption process , this decrease in the sticking probability has to be caused by a purely dynamical effect , namely the steering effect @xcite : although the majority of pathways to dissociative adsorption has non - vanishing barriers with a rather broad distribution of heights and positions , slow molecules can be very efficiently steered to non - activated pathways towards dissociative adsorption by the attractive forces of the potential .",
    "this mechanism becomes less effective at higher kinetic energies where the molecules are too fast to be focused into favourable configurations towards dissociative adsorption .",
    "if the kinetic energy is further increased , the molecules will eventually have enough energy to directly traverse the barrier region leading to the final rise in the sticking probability .",
    "( 10,6.5 )    in order to illustrate the steering effects , we use the results of classical molecular dynamics calculations which have been performed on exactly the same pes as the quantum dynamical calculations @xcite . in these classical calculations",
    "significant differences in the sticking probability compared to the quantum results have been found which are mainly due to zero - point effects . the steering effect , however , is a general mechanism operative in quantum as well as in classical dynamics .",
    "i will therefore use snapshots of two typical trajectories in order to illustrate the dynamical mechanism responsible for the initial decrease of the sticking probaiblity .",
    "these trajectories are plotted in fig .",
    "[ traj2run ] .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen in such a way that the trajectories are restricted to the @xmath9-plane .",
    "the left trajectory demonstrates why the sticking probability is so large at low kinetic energies due to the steering effect .",
    "the incident kinetic energy is @xmath10  ev . in this particular example",
    "the molecular axis is initially almost perpendicular to the surface .",
    "in such a configuration the molecule can not dissociate at the surface .",
    "but the molecule is so slow that the forces acting upon it can reorient the molecule .",
    "it is turned parallel to the surface and then follows a non - activated path towards dissociative adsorption .",
    "this shows how molecule with unfavorable initial conditions can still dissociate due to very efficient steering towards favorable configurations .",
    "this process becomes less effective at higher kinetic energies , which is demonstrated with the right trajectory in fig .",
    "[ traj2run ] .",
    "the initial conditions are the same as for the left trajectory , except for the higher kinetic energy of 0.12  ev .",
    "of course the same forces act upon the molecule , and due to the anisotropy of the pes the molecule also starts to rotate to a configuration parallel to the surface . however , now the molecule is too fast to finish this rotation .",
    "it hits the repulsive wall of the pes at the surface with its molecular axis tilted by about 45@xmath11 with respect to the surface normal . at the classical turning point",
    "there is a very rapid rotation corresponding to a flip - flop motion , and then the molecule is scattered back into the gas - phase rotationally excited .",
    "( 10,6.1 )    now i like to come back to the strong oscillatory structure of the sticking curve for a monoenergetic beam initially in one particular quantum state in fig .",
    "[ h2pdstick ] .",
    "these oscillations are a consequence of the quantum nature of the hydrogen particle , in classical calculations they do not appear @xcite .",
    "if a quantum particle is interacting with a periodic surface , coherent scattering leads to diffraction .",
    "such a calculated diffraction pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ inout ] for hydrogen molecules in the ground state scattering at a pd(100 ) surface with an kinetic energy of @xmath12  mev under an angle of incidence of @xmath13 .",
    "there are rather many diffraction peaks since also rotationally inelastic diffraction can occur , i.e. , scattering in which the rotational state of the molecule is changed .",
    "still the number of diffraction peaks is finite and increases discontinously with increasing energy .",
    "an analysis of the oscillatory structure of the sticking probability in fig .",
    "[ h2pdstick ] reveals that these oscillations can be related to threshold effects associated with the opening of new scattering channels @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have not been observed experimentally yet , although they have been carefully searched for @xcite .",
    "they are very sensitive to the symmetry of the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since pd(100 ) is a very reactive surface , a large fraction of the incoming hydrogen molecules is not scattered back coherently but adsorbs dissociatively .",
    "these adatoms then disturb the periodicity of the surface and thus suppress , in addition to already existing surface imperfections like steps and vacancies , the coherence of the scattering events .",
    "hence the experimental observation of this oscillations actually represents a challenging task .",
    "the dependence of adsorption and desorption on kinetic energy , molecular rotation and orientation @xcite , molecular vibration @xcite , ro - vibrational coupling @xcite , angle of incidence @xcite , and the rotationally elastic and inelastic diffraction of h@xmath0/pd(100 ) @xcite have been studied so far by six - dimensional _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations on the same pes .",
    "the results of these calculations have been compared to a number of independent experiments @xcite , and they are at least in semi - quantitative agreement with all of these experiments this shows that _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations are indeed capable of adequately describing the hydrogen dissociation on transition metal surfaces .",
    "the presence of an adsorbate on a surface can profoundly change the surface reactivity .",
    "a well - known example is the reduction of the activity of the car - exhaust catalyst by lead . but also adsorbed sulfur `` poisons '' this catalyst .",
    "an understanding of the underlying mechanisms and their consequences on the reaction rates is therefore of decisive importance for , e.g. , designing better catalysts .",
    "traditionally an `` trial and error '' approach was used to improve the activity of a catalyst by adding some substances .",
    "on pd(100 ) it is experimentally well - known that the presence of sulfur leads to a large reducting of hydrogen dissociation probability @xcite . while at the clean surface the dissociation probability is about 60% for a kinetic energy of @xmath14",

    "the minimum barrier , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ h2spd_pes]a , has a height of 0.1  ev and corresponds to a configuration in which the h@xmath0 center of mass is located above the fourfold hollow site .",

    "[ h2spd_pes]b ) .",
    "there is a peculiar local minimum at the dissociation path for this configuration when the molecule is still 1 above the pd atoms .",
    "there are apparently subtle compensating effects between the attractive interaction of h@xmath0 with the pd atoms and the repulsion originating from the s atoms",
    "[ h2spd_pes]a and b show that the dissociation is hindered by the formation of energy barriers in the entrance channel of the potential energy surface , however , the hydrogen dissociation is still exothermic , i.e. , the poisoning is not due to site - blocking .",

    "this onset is indeed also in agreement with the experimentally measured mean kinetic energy of hydrogen molecules desorbing from sulfur covered pd(100 ) @xcite .",
    "the question arises where these large differences between theory and experiment come from .",
    "it might be that uncertainties in the experimental determination are responsible for the difference .",
    "the exact sulfur coverage in the experiment was not very well characterized .",
    "the sulfur adlayer was obtained by simply heating up the sample which leads to segregation of bulk sulfur at the surface .",
    "the sulfur coverage was then monitored through the ratio of the auger peaks s@xmath32/pd@xmath33 @xcite . since the hydrogen sticking probability depends sensitively on the sulfur coverage @xcite , a small uncertainty in the sulfur coverage can have a decisive influence .",
    "however , as noted above , while the dft calculations yield that the poisoning is caused by the building up of barriers hindering the dissociation , the vanishing hydrogen saturation coverage for roughly a quarter monolayer of adsorbed sulfur @xcite suggests that any attractive adsorption sites for hydrogen have disappeared due to the presence of sulfur .",
    "these seemingly contradicting results and also the discrepancy between calculated and measured molecular beam sticking probabilities could be reconciled if subsurface sulfur plays an important role for the hydrogen adsorption energies .",
    "subsurface sulfur is not considered in the calculations but might well be present in the experimental samples .",
    "the possible influence of subsurface species on reactions at surfaces certainly represents a very interesting and important research subject for future investigations .    except for this open question ,",
    "there are further interesting results obtained by the dynamical calculations .",
    "the calculated sticking probabilities are not only much larger than the experimental ones , they are also much larger than what one would expect from the hole model .",
    "this demonstrates that steering is not only operative for potential energy surfaces with non - activated reaction paths like for h@xmath0/pd(100 ) , but also for activated systems as h@xmath0/s(2@xmath152)/pd(100 ) . as fig .",
    "[ h2spd_pes ] demonstrates , the sulfur covered pd surface represents a strongly corrugated system with barrier heights varying by more than 2  ev for molecules with their axis parallel to the surface . and the large barriers above the sulfur atoms extend rather far into the gas phase ( see fig .

    "molecules with unfavorable initial conditions are very effectively reoriented to low - barrier sites @xcite .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of the sticking probability with respect to the hole model by a factor of three to four .",
    "figure [ stick ] shows furthermore that the classical molecular dynamics calculations over - estimate the sticking probability of h@xmath0 at s(2@xmath152)/pd(100 ) compared to the quantum results . at small energies below the minimum barrier height the quantum calculations still show some dissociation due to tunneling , as the inset of fig .",
    "[ stick ] reveals , whereas the classical results are of course zero .",
    "but for higher energies the classical sticking probability is up to almost 50% larger than the quantum sticking probabilities .",
    "this suppression is also caused by the large corrugation and the anisotropy of the pes .",
    "the wave function describing the molecule has to pass narrow valleys in the pes in the angular and lateral degrees of freedom in order to dissociate .",
    "this leads to a localization of the wave function and thereby to the building up of zero - point energies which act as additional effective barriers .",
    "while the vibrational h - h mode becomes softer upon dissociation so that the zero - point energy in this particular mode decreases , for the system h@xmath0/s(2@xmath152)/pd(100 ) this decrease is over - compensated by the increase in the zero - point energies of the four other modes perpendicular to the reaction path , i.e. , the sum of _ all _ zero - point energies increases upon adsorption @xcite .",
    "therefore the quantum particles experience an effectively higher barrier region causing the suppressed sticking probability compared to the classical particles .",
    "interestingly enough , if the sum of all zero - point energies remains approximately constant along the reaction path as in the system h@xmath0/pd(100 ) , then these quantum effects almost cancel out @xcite .",

    "i have tried to show that this achievement represents an important step forward in our understanding of the interaction of molecules with surfaces .",
    "not only the quantitative agreement with experiment is improved , but also important qualitative concepts emerge from the electronic structure calculations as well as from the high - dimensional dynamical simulations .",
    "these concepts are applicable to any reaction system .",
    "this represents the importance of hydrogen as a model system for studying reactions on surfaces .",
    "however , the _ ab initio _ treatment of reactions on surfaces has now matured enough so that in the future there will be also more studies on other reaction systems like for example the important class of oxidation reactions on surfaces .",
    "this will be the next step towards a full microscopic description of catalytic reactions , one of the ultimate goals of surface science .",
    "i am very grateful to my collegues and coworkers who have made this work possible .",
    "i would like to mention in particular thomas brunner , bjrk  hammer , ralf  russ , ching - ming wei , steffen  wilke , and last but not least my supervisors helmar teichler , wilhelm brenig and matthias scheffler .",
