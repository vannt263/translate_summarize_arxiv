    "after nearly five decades from the first attempt to obtain a neutrino - driven explosion by @xcite , the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) remains elusive .",
    "it is generally believed that neutrino transport and convection are important ingredients to achieve a successful explosion ( see recent reviews in @xcite ) . however",
    ", modeling ccsne with boltzmann transport in three dimensions is numerically expensive and too time consuming with current computing resources , since the neutrino radiation hydrodynamics with boltzmann transport is essentially a seven - dimensional problem : three spatial coordinates , two angular degrees of freedom , neutrino energy and time .",
    "in addition , there are three types of neutrino species and their anti - particles that would require a solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "ccsn simulations with boltzmann transport have been studied in 1d @xcite , in 2d @xcite and recently in 3d with low resolutions and fixed background profiles @xcite .",
    "however , these 2d and 3d works have ignored the velocity - dependent terms and decoupled these from the energy groups for simplicity , and the spatial resolutions are not sufficient to achieve a correct turbulence cascade .",
    "therefore , approximate methods for the neutrino transport in multi - dimensional simulations are still necessary at this moment .",
    "simple approximatation schemes include the light - bulb scheme @xcite , neutrino leakage , and gray transport . in these schemes ,",
    "the neutrino transport is relatively cheap and therefore , it is possible to perform high resolution simulations in 3d ( with effective angular resolutions @xmath3 ) , better describing the turbulence and convection behind the shock and the standing accretion shock instabilities ( sasi , @xcite ) .",
    "however the neutrino transport in these schemes is possibly over - simplified because it does not really follow the transport of the neutrino distributions and therefore , can not describe the neutrino heating self - consistently .    a more sophisticated but still approximated scheme for the neutrino transport",
    "is called the moment scheme : the multi - group flux limited diffusion ( mgfld ) scheme @xcite takes the zeroth angular moment of neutrino moment expansions ( i.e.  energy density ) .",
    "the m1 moment scheme additionally evolves the momentum density and considers the higher moment closure with an analytic form @xcite or by a variable eddington tensor .",
    "however , as reported by @xcite , the m1 scheme in 3d general relativity ( gr ) is still very expensive and difficult to run in long term postbounce simulations with high resolutions ( an effective angular resolution @xmath4 ) .",
    "another approximated transport scheme is the isotropic diffusion source approximation ( idsa , @xcite ) . in the idsa",
    ", the distribution function is separated into an opaque trapped particle component and a transparent streaming particle component .",
    "the two components are linked by a source term .",
    "therefore , the transport equation becomes a diffusion problem in the opaque region and a ray tracing problem in the transparent region @xcite .",
    "multi - dimensional simulations with the idsa have been performed by @xcite in 2d , and @xcite in 3d .",
    "however , most of these multi - dimensional studies with the idsa or with other transport schemes do not really solve the neutrino transport in multi - dimensions .",
    "instead , they consider the angular distribution to be several 1d problems , i.e.  apply the ray - by - ray ( rbr ) approach .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have pointed out that the rbr approach may artificially exaggerate the neutrino flux variations in the angular and temporal components , since the temporal variation of the neutrino fluxes in convective regions is greatly ignored in the rbr approach . additionally , the rbr approximation overestimates the heating of accretion luminosity on its own ray and underestimates the heating in neighbor rays .    in this paper , we present two - dimensional ccsn simulations with the idsa for neutrino transport in cylindrical coordinates , which is in principle easy to extend to 3d and has better resolution and boundary conditions for the description of the proto - neutron star ( pns ) than simulations in spherical coordinates .",
    "we solve the trapped particle component in multi - dimensions to improve the neutrino transport in angular and temporal directions .",
    "furthermore , we study the neutrino transport effects during collapse by comparing our idsa solver with a parametrized deleptonization scheme from @xcite . we find that the postbounce explosion dynamics is sensitive to the detailed neutrino interactions before core bounce , such as neutrino - electron scattering ( nes ) and electron - capture rates .",
    "additional effects such as gr and magnetic fields are also crucial factors on studying ccsn explosion mechanism , in particular for fast - rotating and more massive progenitors , but we leave these parts for future work . in the following section , the numerical methods and the idsa implementations are described .",
    "a verification of our idsa implementation and a comparison with other neutrino transport schemes is shown in section  [ sec_verification ] . in section  [ sec_results ]",
    ", we apply our idsa implementation to multiple progenitors , using a new sn equation of state ( eos ) . in section  [ sec_conclusions ] , we summarize our results and conclude . a discussion of the different eos is presented in appendix  a.",
    "we describe the numerical code and the corresponding setup of our simulations in [ sec_code ] . the method and implementation of the idsa for neutrino transport is demonstrated in [ sec_neutrino ] .",

    "it should be noted that the `` outflow '' boundary condition , as reported by @xcite , causes a zero - gradient mass accretion at the boundary which will overestimate the inflow and suppress the explosion at late time .",

    "we solve the streaming component in 1d with the original idsa solver , but solve the trapped component and @xmath75 in multi - dimensions . in each time step",
    ", we take the angle - averaged radial bins of fluid and neutrino quantities , such as @xmath17 , @xmath61 , @xmath76 , @xmath22 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , as 1d inputs for the streaming component .",
    "the radial bins contain 600 zones sampled from the center of the proto - neutron star ( pns ) , defined by the location of maximum density , up to @xmath79  km .",
    "the radial bins are uniformly spaced ( @xmath80  km ) up to a radius of @xmath81  km . beyond 400  km , the zone spacing logarithmically increases .",
    "the streaming component carries only to the location of neutrino spheres @xmath82 and the angular integration of the spectral neutrino flux @xmath83 . the local heating from streaming neutrinos",
    "are then determined based on the local neutrino interaction rates based on the multi - dimensional hydro quantities .",
    "it should be noted that the assumption of spherical symmetry in the streaming component may calculate the neutrino flux and heating incorrectly when shocks become highly asymmetric , especially in 2d simulations after the sasi has developed . on the other hand , a rbr approach may artificially enhance the asymmetry and lead to incorrect results as well @xcite .",
    "it is important to have multi - dimensional simulations with both approximations because they are likely to bracket the actual solution : the rbr focusses all heating from the accretion luminosity on its own ray , while the angular integration distributes it over all directions . in reality",
    ", a solution in between these extremes is expected .    for the trapped component",
    ", we explicitly solve the diffusion source @xmath59 and @xmath75 in multi - dimensions and update @xmath68 locally .",
    "together with the streaming component , the new multi - dimensional interaction rates can be updated .",
    "the new neutrino sources are re - evaluated based on multi - dimensional neutrino sources and production rates , and then used for the next streaming step . since we solve the diffusion part explicitly , a stable solution requires a small neutrino time step @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , in our 1d and 2d simulations , we use a fixed hydro timestep with @xmath85  sec and do sub - cycling for the neutrino transport .",
    "since the idsa solver in the streaming component allows larger time step , we adopt two types of sub - cycles .",
    "one for the streaming component with @xmath86  sec , and the other for the trapped component with @xmath87  sec .",
    "additionally , the neutrino pressure contributes extra momentum and can be expressed by , @xmath88 we note that equations ( [ eq_nu_energy ] ) and ( [ eq_nu_pressure ] ) include all thermodynamically important @xmath89  terms of the boltzmann transport equation .",
    "these @xmath89  terms have been considered as crucial for ccsn modeling @xcite .",
    "our idsa solver only includes electron flavor neutrinos .",
    "we use 20 energy bins which are spaced logarithmically from 3  mev to 300  mev . for heavy neutrinos",
    ", the energy release is treated by a leakage scheme that is based on the local diffusion and the local production rates @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab_interactions ] summarizes all weak interactions that are included in this work .",
    "all weak interactions in the idsa solver are using the bruenn description @xcite .",
    "note that the idsa solver dose not include the nes ( interaction  5 in table  [ tab_interactions ] ) .",
    "nes is important during the collapse phase but provides minor contributions in the postbounce phase @xcite ( see section  [ sec_cc ] for a demonstration ) .",
    "@xcite found a simple relation between the electron deleptonization with the gas density in the collapse phase , where electron fraction and entropy can be parametrized by density and chemical potentials .",
    "this parametrized deleptonization ( pd ) scheme can take interactions effectively into account that are only implemented in the boltzmann solver that is used to determine the parameters for the pd .",
    "we have recalibrated the fitting parameters with different progenitors for the pd scheme by running agile - boltztran @xcite , since the original parameters in @xcite are calibrated for the progenitors g15 ( s15s7b2 , @xcite ) and n13 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab_parameters ] summarizes the fitting parameters we use during collapse . in this paper",
    "we include the effect of nes by means of using the pd scheme in the collapse phase .",
    "since the scheme is independent of the neutrino fractions , we update the neutrino fractions and energy through the idsa solver during collapse .",
    "after bounce , we turn off the pd and switch to the idsa solver . for simulations without nes",
    ", we use the idsa solver from the beginning of core collapse to postbounce .    to verify our idsa implementation in flash ,",
    "we provide a code comparison of flash - idsa with agile - idsa and with existing results from the literature in section  [ sec_verification ] .",
    "we use the nuclear eos unit in flash which incorporates the finite temperature eos routines from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lattimer & swesty eos ( with incompressibility , @xmath90  mev ; @xcite ) and hempel & schaffner - bielich ( hs ) dd2 eos are used in this work .",

    "the description of nuclei in supernova matter is based on @xcite .",
    "this eos was first applied in core - collapse supernova simulations by @xcite , where further details can be found .",
    "ls220 is one of the most common and well - studied eos in the supernova community .",
    "however , it has some deficiencies , for example it is based on the single nucleus approximation for heavy nuclei , and considers only the alpha particle as a degree of freedom of all possible light nuclei .",
    "see @xcite for a comparison of predictions for cluster formation for the hs(dd2 ) and the ls220 eos with experiments , where good agreement was found .",
    "furthermore , it was shown by @xcite , that the neutron matter eos of ls220 is in disagreement with constraints from chiral effective field theory .",

    "we use ls220 for a code verification test in section  [ sec_verification ] and then use dd2 for our main simulations in section  [ sec_results ] . a low - density extension for the eos",
    "is included in the routines from @xcite . in appendex  b",
    ", we provide a brief discussion of the differences between ls220 and dd2 .      in this paper , we consider four different nonrotating , solar - metallicity progenitors , s11.0 , s15.0 , s21.0 , and s27.0 from @xcite for our multiple progenitor study .",
    "we also consider two nonrotating , solar - metallicity progenitors , s15 and s20 from @xcite for a comparison study .",
    "figure  [ fig_progenitors ] shows the initial density distribution of these six progenitors .",
    "the s11.0 progenitor has the highest core density but the most dilute envelope .",
    "the s21.0 and s27.0 and s20 progenitors have a similar density distribution and the most massive envelope among the models , but have a different mass of the iron core and si / o shell .",
    "the locations of regions with a high density gradient correspond to the si / o interface .",
    "for the same progenitor mass , s15 has a denser core and more massive envelope than s15.0 .",
    "another common progenitor model used in the literature is the s15s7b2 progenitor from @xcite .",
    "it has the same progenitor mass as @xmath91 and @xmath92 but the si / o interface is located much further inside .",
    "this difference may make significant changes on the postbounce shock - radius evolutions when the shock reaches the interface due to a different mass - accretion history @xcite .    to adopt the progenitor models in flash , we map the one - dimensional density , temperature , electron fraction , and radial velocity profiles from @xcite into our 1d/2d grids in flash .",
    "other thermodynamic quantities are re - calculated using the eos solver in flash .",
    "neutrino fractions are set to zero at beginning .",
    "to verify the idsa implementation in flash , we first compare our 1d flash simulations with simulations with agile - idsa @xcite in section  [ sec_cc_idsa ] .",
    "agile - idsa is a 1d spherically symmetric lagrangian code which is publicly available online . in @xcite , a nice agreement of agile - idsa with the gr boltzmann code agile - boltztran @xcite",
    "was shown .",
    "since we want to compare our results with the same neutrino transport scheme ( idsa ) , we run additional simulations in agile - idsa but turn off the gr correction for the gravitational potential .",
    "we also turn off the pd during collapse in both codes to test the idsa solver for neutrino transport before and after bounce .    in section  [ sec_cc ] , we show 1d and 2d flash simulations with the two widely used progenitors , s15 and s20 from @xcite and discuss the differences compared to other transport schemes . furthermore , we run agile - boltztran simulations to demonstrate the importance of nes during core collapse and discuss the influence of the utilized neutrino opacities and electron capture rates on the shock evolution and neutrino signal .",
    "we perform 1d ccsn simulations of the four investigated progenitors ( @xmath93 , @xmath91 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) with the ls220 eos in both flash and agile - idsa .",
    "figure  [ fig_agile_collapse ] shows the radial profiles of density , electron fraction , entropy and radial velocity of the progenitor @xmath91 during collapse .",
    "it is clear to see that the bounce profiles ( black lines in figure  [ fig_agile_collapse ] ) are nearly identical in the two codes .",
    "small differences at the center could originate from the fact that agile - idsa is a lagrangian code with a moving mesh . at the beginning of a simulation ,",
    "the innermost region of the progenitor star is much less resolved than with the eulerian grid of flash .",
    "therefore , the radial profiles in agile - idsa evolve slightly slower than those in flash .",
    "furthermore , the bounce time in flash is about @xmath96  ms later than in agile - idsa , depending on the progenitor star .",
    "figure  [ fig_agile_delep ] shows the electron and lepton fractions of the progenitor @xmath91 at core bounce .",
    "it is found that the electron fraction is consistent in both codes , but lepton fraction shows a mismatch at @xmath97  g  @xmath98 , suggesting a lower electron neutrino distribution at low densities region in flash .",
    "however , this difference does not alter the postbounce evolution much since the neutrinos are simply free streaming in the low density region .",
    "we note that in our multi - dimensional idsa solver , we have employed a limiter for the diffusion scalar @xmath75 .",
    "the limiter enforces the trapped component to have a small value , when @xmath99 , to prevent unphysical oscillation on the @xmath75 , when the trapped neutrino density goes to zero in the free - streaming regime .",
    "this limiter leads to small differences of the neutrino luminosity and mean energy , but does not affect the hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "figure  [ fig_agile_spectra ] shows the particle spectra of the trapped and streaming components at 150  ms postbounce of the progenitor @xmath91 .",
    "we show three different regions where the trapped particle component dominates ( at @xmath100  km ) , trapped and streaming particle components are comparable ( at @xmath101  km ) , and where the streaming particle component dominates ( @xmath102  km ) .",
    "there are small differences in the particle spectra , but we do not expect exactly identical spectra in the two codes , since the hydrodynamic parts are different .    a comparison of radial profiles of the density , electron fraction , entropy , and radial velocity of the progenitor @xmath91 in both codes at different postbounce times is shown in figure  [ fig_agile_postbounce ] .",
    "we note that although there are some differences in the radial shock location , the profiles and shock locations are consistent in the mass coordinate .",
    "the post bounce shock radius evolution for the four progenitor models are shown in figure  [ fig_agile_rshock ] .",
    "overall , the evolutions of the shock radius are nearly the same but show slight differences at @xmath103  ms ( @xmath104  ms ) in the model @xmath93 ( @xmath95 ) when the shock reaches the si / o interface .",
    "figure  [ fig_agile_luminosity ] shows the time evolution of electron - type neutrino luminosity and mean neutrino energy for the four considered models .",
    "the values are sampled at a radius of 500  km in both codes .",
    "the electron neutrino luminosities and electron anti - neutrino luminosities are similar for the two codes around bounce and early postbounce . however , at @xmath105  ms post bounce , the neutrino and anti - neutrino luminosities in flash become slightly higher than in agile - idsa for the progenitors @xmath91 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the maximum difference is an increase of about @xmath106 in flash at @xmath107  ms post bounce .",
    "after @xmath108  ms post bounce , the neutrino luminosities are back to the same value in both codes but the anti - neutrino luminosity remains slightly higher in flash simulations .",
    "for the progenitor @xmath93 , the electron neutrino luminosity is the same in both codes but the electron antineutrino luminosity is slightly higher in flash .",
    "however , we note that the mean neutrino and anti - neutrino energies in flash are about @xmath109 lower than in agile - idsa . this difference could originate from the lower neutrino fraction in the low density region in flash ( see figure  [ fig_agile_delep ] ) , since we measure the neutrino mean energy at @xmath110  km .",
    "the kernel of our idsa solver in flash is the same as the solver in agile - idsa .",
    "the main differences are from the hydrodynamics , the explicit solver for the diffusion scalar @xmath75 in equation  [ eq_alpha ] , the detailed treatment of the eos , and potentially , also the gravity solver .",
    "the low - density extension for the eos in flash and differences in the internal energy shift may also provide slightly differences . in principle , we should expect identical results in both codes in 1d . as presented above ,",
    "although some little differences have been observed , most features are consistent and in nice agreement .",
    "@xcite have performed a code comparison of the boltzmann solver agile - boltztran with the variable eddington factor vertex code .",
    "both codes have sophisticated physics input in spherical symmetry but different implementations .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the different grids in the lagrangian or eulerian coordinates produce late time differences in the shock evolution when the shock runs through shell interfaces . since flash is also an eulerian code , similar differences between flash and agile - idsa as we have found here can be expected .",

    "in addition , @xcite have shown that different neutrino opacities and approximations could lead to different post - bounce evolutions by using spherically symmetric agile - boltztran simulations with the s15 progenitor .",
    "therefore these two progenitor models are very suitable for comparisons among different sn codes .",
    "it is generally agreed that the vertex - prometheus and the chimera @xcite codes use state - of - the - art physics for neutrino transport .",
    "therefore , it is worth to perform simulations with these progenitor models to have a direct comparison .",
    "however , there is still different physics employed in the above mentioned works .",

    ", we only give a qualitative discussion .    to evaluate that the pd scheme could effectively represent nes , we perform three newtonian agile - boltztran simulations with the s15 progenitor and the ls220 eos . the first simulation ( model ab - nr )",
    "includes the nes ; the second simulation ( model ab - nr - nones ) ignores the nes ; and the third simulation ( model ab - nr - mix ) includes nes only in the collapse phase .",
    "figure  [ fig_cc_1d ] shows the shock - radius and neutrino luminosity evolutions of these three simulations together with flash - idsa simulations with and without pd .",
    "ignoring nes ( models flash - idsa and ab - nones in figure  [ fig_cc_1d ] ) gives a short - period of shock expansion at @xmath112  ms postbounce .",
    "a signature from this can also be seen in the electron anti - neutrino luminosity .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the model `` n - reduceop '' in @xcite , and the shock and electron - type neutrino luminosity evolutions of our flash - idsa simulation without pd is also consistent with our agile - boltztran simulation ( ab - nr - nones ) .",
    "the model ab - nr - mix is nearly identical to the model ab - nr , demonstrating that nes is important mainly during the collapse phase ( figure  [ fig_cc_1d ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that that nes plays a role in the late time pns cooling and deleptonization ( @xmath113  s ) after the explosion .",
    "however , our simulations focus only on the first few hundred milliseconds . the pd scheme in model flash - pd",
    "greatly improves the post - bounce simulation , making our flash - idsa simulations closer to the agile - boltztran simulation with full neutrino reactions .",
    "although there is no perfect match , we conclude that the use of the pd scheme in the collapse phase could effectively take into account the nes .",
    "it should be noted that heavy neutrinos are treated by a simple leakage scheme which could lead to some difference in our idsa simulations as well .    in figure  [ fig_cc_2d ]",
    ", we show the shock - radius evolution and neutrino signatures of our 2d flash - idsa simulations of the s15 and s20 progenitors from @xcite . to get a fair comparison , we enable the pd scheme during collapse and use the ls220 eos .",

    "we find that although the growth rate of the pns mass in models 2d - da and 2d - dp are different , the final pns mass in models 2d - dp are only slightly larger ( @xmath207 ) , and the radii of pnss in models 2d - da are slightly lower than that in models 2d - dp , giving a more compact pns core in models 2d - da .",
    "this can also be related to the earlier explosion times of models da .",
    "figure  [ fig_2d_central_values ] shows the central density , central electron , lepton fraction , central entropy and central temperature as functions of time .",
    "models 2d - da show higher central densities and higher central @xmath22 ( higher electron pressures ) , but lower central entropies and central temperatures than the models 2d - dp , giving a more compact pns core . however , the density in the outer layer of the pns is higher and more convective in models 2d - dp than that in models 2d - da .",
    "therefore , models 2d - dp have a higher pns mass and radius ( see figure  [ fig_2d_pns ] ) .",
    "we have performed self - consistent ccsn simulations for the four nonrotating , solar - metallicity progenitors , s11.0 , s15.0 , s21.0 , and s27.0 from @xcite and s15 and s20 from @xcite using the amr code flash with an idsa for neutrino transport .",
    "a very good agreement of flash - idsa with agile - idsa is shown in section  [ sec_cc_idsa ] , though some small differences still exist .",
    "in addition , we have provided a comparison of our multi - dimensional idsa results for the s15 and s20 progenitors from @xcite with results in the existing literature . however",
    ", a detailed comparison with an exchange of data and collaboration among groups would be necessary to understand remaining different results with regard to the underlying physics .",
    "the new sn eos hs ( dd2 ) is employed in this study and a comparison with the standard ls220 eos is discussed in appendix  a. it is found that the dd2 eos shows a faster shock expansion , and a higher mass in the gain region , while the neutrino luminosities are similar , causing the dd2 eos to lead to slightly earlier and stronger explosions than the ls220 .",
    "we have presented two sets of simulations which compared the neutrino transport with the idsa ( but ignoring nes ; abbreviated da ) with the parametrized deleptonization scheme ( which includes nes effectively ; abbreviated dp ) during collapse .",
    "the results show clearly that the treatment of neutrino weak interactions and the level of deleptonziation during the collapse phase have a significant impact on the neutrino - driven explosions .",
    "all our 2d models explode within @xmath158  ms .",
    "models without nes explode much easier , stronger and faster than models with nes , the diagnostic explosion energy in our simulations are around @xmath208 in models 2d - dp ( see table  [ tab_simulations ] ) and around @xmath209  b in models 2d - da .",
    "our explosion energies are likely to decrease when we include general relativistic effects and better electron - capture rates in future models .    in our simulations",
    ", we do not use the typical rbr approach for the neutrino transport .",
    "instead , we solve the diffusion part in multi - dimensions , improving the neutrino transport in angular and temporal directions . with this approach",
    ", the prompt convection after the core bounce causes a fast shock expansion ( @xmath210  ms ) , enlarging the gain region at late time , and therefore helps to increase the explosion energy at late time .",
    "however , this prompt convection may be amplified by grid - effects in cylindrical coordinates . to address this issue",
    ", a full 3d simulation will be necessary or a detailed comparison with simulations in spherical coordinates .",
    "furthermore , we have found sasi activities at late time in progenitors @xmath91 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , but in most cases , the explosions are mainly due to neutrino - driven convection .",
    "future work will relax the constraints imposed by axisymmetry .",
    "models in 3d will permit to study a more realistic turbulence cascade and rotation .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "this work was supported by the european research council ( erc ; fp7 ) under erc advanced grant agreement n@xmath211  321263  -  fish , by the pasc high performance computing grant diaphane , and by the swiss national science foundation ( snf ) .",

    "part of this work was inspired during the micra2013 meeting in ect*. we thank albino perego for the development of the leakage scheme for heavy neutrinos .",

    "k.c.p .  acknowledges sean couch for releasing his supernova setup in the public version of flash .",
    "flash was developed largely by the doe - supported asc / alliances center for astrophysical thermonuclear flashes at the university of chicago .",
    "the simulations have been carried out at the cscs monte - rosa under grant no .",
    "analysis and visualization of simulation data were completed using the analysis toolkit yt @xcite .",
    "several simulations in this paper use the new dd2 eos , while most multi - dimensional simulations found in the literatures use ls220 .",
    "we therefore briefly describe the qualitative differences between the simulations with the dd2 and the ls220 eos in this section .",
    "we perform 1d and 2d simulations of the progenitor @xmath91 with dd2 and ls220 eos ( models 1d - da15 , 2d - da15 , 1d - la15 and 2d - la15 in table  [ tab_simulations ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we use da15 to refer to both models 1d - da15 and 2d - da15 , and similarly we use la15 to refer to the models 1d - la15 and 2d - la15 .",
    "their main features are summarized in table  [ tab_simulations ] ) .",
    "the pd scheme is turned off in order to study the impact of the eos on the neutrino transport .",
    "the angle - averaged radial profiles of density , electron fraction , entropy , and radial velocity are shown in figure  [ fig_eos_collapse ] for the prebounce phase . as discussed in section  [ sec_results ] ,",
    "the radial profiles in the collapse phase are nearly identical in both 1d and 2d .",
    "in addition , the density and radial velocity evolutions in models da15 and la15 are also similar during the collapse but models da15 collapse slower than models la15 .",
    "therefore , models da15 reach core bounce about @xmath212  ms later than models la15 .",
    "while there are no significant differences of the neutrino luminosity and mean energy between models da15 and la15 ( figure  [ fig_eos_luminosity ] ) , models da15 show a lower central density and higher pns radius than la15 .",
    "the time evolutions of central density and electron fraction of models da15 and la15 are shown in figure  [ fig_eos_central_values ] .",
    "furthermore , models da15 have a higher central electron and lepton fraction than models dl15 .",
    "2d models also show a lower pns mass and a higher pns radius than 1d ( figure  [ fig_eos_pns ] ) , but the pns masses are similar in both dd2 and ls220 ( see table  [ tab_simulations ] ) .    since the bounce time in models da15 take longer than models la15 , the si / o interface reaches a smaller radius in models da15",
    "( @xmath213  km ) than in la15 ( @xmath103  km , see figure  [ fig_eos_collapse ] ) .",
    "the bounce shock hits the si / o interface earlier in models da15 than in la15 , generating a prompt convection and fast shock expansion at @xmath119  ms postbounce .",
    "the earlier interaction between the bounce shock with the si / o interface in model 2d - da15 makes the shock radius in model 2d - da15 larger than in simulation 2d - la15 . furthermore , the larger shock radius in model 2d - da15 produces a higher mass in the gain region ( see figure  [ fig_eos_gain_mass ] ) , suggesting that the models with the dd2 eos explodes more easily than the models with the ls220 eos .",
    "the averaged shock radius evolution of models da15 and la15 can be seen in figure  [ fig_eos_shock ] .",
    "the explosion time ( @xmath115 ) in 2d - da15 is about @xmath214  ms earlier than in 2d - la15 . in figure",
    "[ fig_eos_postbounce ] , we compare the radial density , electron fraction , entropy , and velocity profiles in 1d and 2d for dd2 and ls220 at 1 , 3 , 50 , 100 , and 200  ms postbounce . before @xmath119  ms postbounce , models ls15 show a faster shock expansion than models da15 but the shock radius in da15 become larger after the si / o interface has reached the shock at @xmath119  ms .    figure  [ fig_eos_sasi ] shows the normalized decomposition into legendre polynomials ( equation  [ eq_sasi ] ) of the shock radius of models 2d - da15 and 2d - la15 . the corresponding entropy distribution at the north and south pole is shown in figure  [ fig_eos_entr_timeevo ] .",
    "the sasi activities start at @xmath215  s in both 2d - da15 and 2d - la15 after the si / o interface reach the shock and the amplitude of the normalized coefficients @xmath216 do not show significant difference .",
    "we remark that a more through investigation of the eos effects will be the subject of a future study .",
