    "a single quantum dot has a distinct energy spectrum and has often been termed an ` artificial atom ' .",
    "one may thus expect a periodic array of quantum dots to exhibit collective properties of an ` artificial solid ' .",
    "this has been a strong motivation for a wide variety of experimental and theoretical work on quantum dot lattices ( qdls ) . two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    "qdls have primarily been realized using self - assembled nanocrystal arrays .",
    "@xcite electrical transport in these systems is governed not only by electron - electron interactions but also by disorder .",
    "this is clearly reflected in transport studies , which go well beyond the observation of standard coulomb blockade .",
    "for example , parthasarathy _",
    "et al . _ have emphasized the important role that structural and charge disorder can play on the current - voltage [ @xmath0 ] characteristics of the system .",
    "@xcite it has also been shown recently that the transport through such arrays can exhibit cotunneling effects , leading to an efros - shklovskii type variable range hopping ,  @xcite signifying the importance of coulomb interactions in the system .",
    "other routes toward fabricating 2d qdls include lithographically defined metal islands  @xcite and semiconductor quantum dot arrays .",
    "@xcite    with regard to the study of many - body physics , we expect semiconductor qdls to exhibit a significant advantage due to primarily two reasons ; ( 1 ) the inter - dot coupling and dot charging energy can be controlled _ in situ _ using gate voltages , ( 2 ) the high fermi temperatures in these systems should allow for the observation of mott - hubbard - like physics at experimentally accessible temperatures .",
    "@xcite early measurements using far - infrared spectroscopy were used to study the energy levels of individual quantum dots in a gate - defined qdl .",
    "@xcite a similar method was employed to study the transition from an antidot lattice ( adl ) to a qdl using a single grid - like gate .",
    "@xcite very recently , optical studies on a large array of etched quantum dots in a gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) have even shown the existence of mott - hubbard electrons .",
    "@xcite however , electrical transport through such semiconductor qdls remains relatively unexplored .",
    "used a patterned gate  @xcite to introduce a periodic potential in the 2deg .",
    "their magnetic field studies showed a splitting of landau levels when the periodic potential was weak , and possible signatures of a qdl for stronger potentials .",
    "a similar device structure was used to study the combined effects of a weak periodic potential and strong disorder in large quantizing magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite duruz _",
    "_ were the first to study non - equilibrium transport through an _ etched _",
    "qdl with a significantly stronger confining potential .",
    "@xcite they found @xmath0 to follow a power law , in agreement with the predictions of middleton and wingreen ( mw ) .",
    "@xcite however , they focused primarily on hysteresis and switching effects in the system .",
    "more recently , dorn _",
    "studied a similar system with quantum dots defined by a combination of atomic force microscope oxidation and a top gate .",
    "@xcite they did not appear to observe the standard power law dependence expected from a collective behavior of the qdl , but used percolation analysis and magneto - transport to establish transport through a ` network ' of quantum dots .    in this work we focus on the _ dc _ transport through a tunable qdl in a gaas / algaas 2deg , which is defined solely by electrostatic gating .",
    "the electrostatic definition of the qdl allows us to controllably alter the potential landscape in the 2deg .",
    "it also avoids the inevitable introduction of additional disorder associated with etching and oxidation techniques .",
    "the versatility of the device structure enables us to drive the system from a delocalized adl to a localized qdl by simply changing the gate voltage configuration .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to decouple the effects of strong background disorder from transport through the qdl of interest , something which has not been possible thus far .",
    "the 2deg used for these studies was located 60  nm below the surface and the si @xmath2-doping layer was located 30  nm above the 2deg .",
    "the wafers had an as - grown sheet density ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4  m@xmath5 , and low temperature mobility of @xmath6  m@xmath7/vs .",
    "the device structure is outlined in figure  [ fig1]a .",
    "the first layer consists of a ti / au ( 20  nm/15  nm ) perforated gate ( pg ) on the substrate .",
    "figure  [ fig1]b shows a scanning electron micrograph of a typical pg .",
    "this is followed by a 150  nm thick cross - linked polymethyl methacrylate ( cl pmma ) layer , which is obtained by exposing the desired portion of pmma to a large electron beam dose .",
    "the cl pmma serves as a dielectric layer and is resistant to further processing of the device . finally , an un - patterned ti / au ( 25  nm/80  nm ) top gate ( tg ) is deposited such that it lies directly above the pg .",
    "we present results on two kinds of devices .",
    "the first ( dev1 ) has a pg which consists of a @xmath8 array of perforations with diameter , @xmath9  nm and center to center distance , @xmath10  nm . the second ( dev2 ) has @xmath11  nm and @xmath12  nm and an array of @xmath13 perforations .",
    "all measurements were performed in a he-3 cryostat with a base temperature of @xmath14  mk .",
    "by applying a large negative voltage on the tg ( @xmath15 ) , regions in the 2deg directly below the pg perforations are depleted , resulting in a periodic antidot potential which intersects the fermi surface .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure  [ fig1]c , where in addition to the periodic potential , there exist random fluctuations in the conduction band minimum that arise from background disorder .",
    "as long as @xmath16 is relatively high ( depicted by @xmath17 ) , the system is delocalized as a whole , and an antidot lattice is formed .",
    "figure  [ fig1]d shows a three - dimensional schematic of the potential landscape in such a case .",
    "the application of a magnetic field now results in the emergence of commensurability peaks in resistance ( @xmath18 ) arising from pinned orbits around the antidots  .@xcite figure  [ fig1]f clearly shows that as @xmath15 is lowered , the resistance maxima ( associated with orbits around 1 , 4 , and 9 antidots ) become more pronounced . the position of the fundamental commensurability peak ( orbits around 1 antidot )",
    "may be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electronic charge . evaluating this for dev2 ,",
    "gives @xmath21  t , in very good agreement with the peak position in figure  [ fig1]f .",
    "we have studied such antidot lattices in detail previously ,  @xcite and have demonstrated a fine control over the potential landscape in the 2deg . as @xmath16 is lowered to @xmath22 ( figure  [ fig1]c ) ,",
    "the electrons become confined to the potential minima arising from the antidots , thereby forming a qdl , as depicted in figure  [ fig1]e .",
    "a measurement of the equilibrium conductance ( @xmath23 ) shows signatures of such a transition for dev1 .",
    "we note that dev1 consists of smaller , more closely spaced perforations , which should make coulomb blockade related effects more observable .",
    "we therefore focus on dev1 for the remainder of this work .",
    "figure  [ fig1]g shows the behavior of @xmath23 ( measured using standard low frequency lock - in techniques ) as a function of @xmath15 for different voltages on the pg ( @xmath24 ) . as @xmath24 is reduced ( @xmath16 is reduced ) from @xmath25  mv ( top trace ) to @xmath26  mv ( bottom trace ) , the action of the tg becomes significantly stronger .",
    "this suggests that when both @xmath15 and @xmath24 are sufficiently negative , a qdl is realized , where the quantum dots are formed between four adjacent antidots and are coupled to each other through the high inter - dot tunnel resistances of the resultant quasi one - dimensional channels ( see figure  [ fig1]e ) .",
    "the shaded region in figure  [ fig1]h shows the portion of the @xmath15-@xmath24 phase space where such a situation is realized .",
    "note that in this region we always have @xmath27 , suggesting that the tunnel resistance between dots is larger than the resistance quantum .",
    "a similar transition from a delocalized state to a localized one has been reported in semiconductor quantum dot arrays .",
    "@xcite however , neither of these studies concentrated on the @xmath0 characteristics of the system . to validate our description of the formation of a qdl outlined above ,",
    "we perform a systematic study of the @xmath0 characteristics of the device .",
    "we apply a symmetric bias across the device ( @xmath28 at one end and @xmath29 at the other ) , and the current is measured using a keithley 2400 source measure unit .",
    "when the device is tuned to the qdl regime , we expect @xmath0 to obey the mw model  @xcite and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the threshold voltage below which the current is suppressed , and @xmath32 is the power law exponent .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a shows that the device is perfectly ohmic when @xmath33  mv ( indicating a relatively high @xmath16 ) and @xmath34  v ( dashed line ) .",
    "as @xmath15 is reduced to @xmath35  v , there is an observable deviation from linearity , characteristic of coulomb blockade .",
    "a further reduction in @xmath15 strengthens this non - linearity . in figure",
    "[ fig2]b we plot @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 ( the normalized voltage ) .",
    "according to equation  [ eq1 ] , we expect multiple curves with different values of @xmath31 to collapse onto a single trace with a unique @xmath32 .",
    "our curves show a reasonable collapse , with a clear power law characterized by @xmath38 .",
    "the absence of a sharp threshold in figure  [ fig2]a makes it difficult to directly identify @xmath31 .",
    "however , the shape of the curves in figure  [ fig2]b are highly sensitive to the choice of @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore adopt the procedure followed by rimberg _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and choose @xmath31 such that the traces exhibit a power law over the largest possible range .",
    "this results in a relatively small ( @xmath39 ) error in the estimation of @xmath31 .",
    "we note that at lower values of @xmath24 , the threshold becomes more apparent and it is possible to easily identify @xmath31 . however , as we will show later , the effects of background disorder also become more pronounced at lower @xmath24 , and it is not possible to obtain the collapse observed in figure  [ fig2]b . at any rate , we can certainly conclude that the introduction of the periodic potential using @xmath15 results in @xmath0 that exhibits a clear power law , characteristic of a qdl .",
    "we note that sweeping the bias voltage up and down did not result in any hysteresis , as observed in some previous work .",
    "@xcite also , there were no observable leakage currents ( @xmath40  pa ) for all the gate voltage configurations used in this study .",
    "if our picture of the potential landscape is indeed correct , we should also be able to induce a qdl by keeping @xmath15 fixed , and lowering @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows precisely this .",
    "the dashed line indicates that the @xmath0 is linear when @xmath16 is high ( @xmath41  mv ) , with @xmath42  v. as @xmath24 is reduced from @xmath43  mv to @xmath26  mv , the non - linearity becomes more apparent , and we see the emergence of a clear @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows that all the curves exhibit a clear power law , however a collapse according to equation  [ eq1 ] is only possible for higher values of @xmath24 ( shown separately in the inset for clarity ) .",
    "again , we find @xmath38 , as observed in figure  [ fig3]b , reinforcing the fact that both sets of gate voltage configurations yield a qdl with similar characteristics .",
    "we also observe a slight upturn at higher values of @xmath36 , but are not certain about its origin at present .",
    "below @xmath33  mv , @xmath32 steadily increases to @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , @xmath31 increases quite rapidly from @xmath45  mv to @xmath46  mv as @xmath24 is reduced from @xmath47  mv to @xmath26  mv ( figure  [ fig3]c ) .",
    "it has been shown that an increase in background charge disorder can significantly enhance @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite in a 2deg , such disorder arises primarily due to potential fluctuations from the dopant layer .",
    "as @xmath16 is reduced , the ability of the 2deg to screen the disorder becomes progressively weaker , thereby increasing the amount of charge variation within the qdl .",
    "we believe that this accounts for the observation of the rapidly increasing @xmath31 .",
    "we expect @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of quantum dots in the direction of transport , @xmath50 is the charging energy of each dot , and @xmath51 is a factor which depends on the lattice geometry and the relevant capacitances in the system .",
    "@xcite in the limit of weak inter - dot coupling , @xmath52 for a square lattice . in the absence of a precise knowledge of the potential landscape",
    ", we use the lithographic dimensions as a guide to estimate @xmath53  mv [ dashed line in figure  [ fig3]c ] , assuming a quantum dot radius of @xmath54  nm .",
    "this is sketched as a ( to scale ) schematic in the inset of figure  [ fig3]c .",
    "note that @xmath31 increases by almost @xmath55 times as @xmath24 is reduced from @xmath43  mv to @xmath26  mv .",
    "assuming that all other parameters remain constant , this would imply that the dot radius reduces by a factor of 10 and approaches @xmath56  nm , which seems unlikely . thus , the behavior of @xmath31 can not be explained by just a variation in the properties of the quantum dots and their coupling .",
    "this supports the scenario where , at significantly low values of @xmath16 , transport through the previously uniform qdl has an added contribution from disorder .",
    "this effectively increases the energy required for an electron to move from one end to the other , thus increasing @xmath31 .        to test this hypothesis , we set @xmath34 and take @xmath24 to large negative values , where the zero bias conductance is zero . under these circumstances ,",
    "when we have driven the system well below the percolation threshold , there should be no significant contribution from the qdl .",
    "instead , we expect the transport to be completely dominated by an array of disconnected electron puddles with a distribution of sizes .  @xcite figure  [ fig4]a shows @xmath0 for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "not only do these curves have a very well - defined @xmath31 , but all of them can be characterized by a single @xmath57 ( figure  [ fig4]b ) .",
    "this indicates that the observed increase in @xmath32 and @xmath31 in figure  [ fig3]b and c respectively , is directly related to the increasing effect of disorder . from the inset of figure  [",
    "fig4]b it is clear that in this transport regime it is impossible to collapse the traces using the standard mw model described by equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "however , a universal curve is obtained if each trace is translated by an amount @xmath58 ( figure  [ fig4]b ) .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig4]c shows that @xmath31 varies linearly with @xmath24 , with much larger values of @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that these results are strikingly similar to those of parthasarathy _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite the only difference being that they observed a similar dependence of the @xmath0 on _ temperature _ ( @xmath59 ) , rather than gate voltage .",
    "they ascribed the linear dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath59 to the existence of a distribution of charging energies in a highly disordered qdl .",
    "as the temperature increases , certain quantum dots become transparent and do not contribute to @xmath31 .",
    "a detailed analysis based on results from percolation theory was able to explain the linear relationship between @xmath31 and @xmath59 , and a collapse of @xmath36 vs @xmath60 traces .",
    "a similar distribution of charging energies is quite probable in a highly inhomogeneous 2deg .",
    "when @xmath16 is increased , certain inter - dot barriers are effectively overcome , resulting in a reduction in @xmath31 . we expect this to continue up to some characteristic @xmath16 , above which the system looks fairly homogeneous . though this description is qualitatively in line with our observations , more detailed calculations are required to verify the validity of the model .",
    "an alternative explanation for the linearity in @xmath31 may lie in the fact that at extremely low values of @xmath24 , the fermi level lies well below the conduction band minimum .",
    "the application of a large bias voltage then induces carriers , resulting in the onset of conduction at @xmath31 . in this scenario",
    ", one would also expect @xmath31 to be proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "further experiments are required to understand this scaling of the @xmath0 characteristics at significantly lower values of @xmath24 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied non - equilibrium transport through an electrostatically defined quantum dot lattice .",
    "our dual gated device structure has a significant advantage over previous designs in that it allows us to decouple the effects of strong background disorder from those arising solely due to the qdl .",
    "these effects are reflected in an increase in the threshold voltage as well as a deviation from the standard mw scaling .",
    "our results are particularly important for semiconductor - based qdl architectures which aim to probe collective phenomena using transport .",
