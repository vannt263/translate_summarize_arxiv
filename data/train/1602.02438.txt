    "recent theoretical studies reveal that in two dimensions strongly interacting two - component bosons in a magnetic field can realize a bosonic integer quantum hall ( biqh ) state  @xcite .",
    "the biqh phase characterized by hall conductivity quantized to an even integer  @xcite is protected by a global @xmath1-symmetry and the real - space entanglement spectrum of this state hosts two counter propagating chiral modes .",
    "recently , two different lattice versions of biqh states have been proposed at integer filling @xmath0 of the lowest topological flat - band with chern number @xmath2 .",
    "the optical flux lattice has been studied by exact diagonalization of the projected hamiltonian in momentum space  @xcite and the correlated haldane - honeycomb lattice has been studied by infinite density matrix renormalization group of hardcore boson in real space  @xcite .",
    "this is different from the two dimensional topological @xmath3 band filled by hardcore bosons at @xmath0 , which is believed to exhibit the fermi - liquid - like state  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath4 , a series of color - entangled abelian topological states have been suggested at various filling numbers under repulsive two - body interaction  @xcite . in harper - hofstadter model with topological @xmath2 band ,",
    "different emergent topological states including the symmetry protected biqh state , can be understood by an insightful approach from streda formula of composite fermion  @xcite .",
    "so far , the study on biqh state for single component bosons on topological hofstadter lattice is still lacking .",
    "it is interesting to compare the biqh in such a system with other lattice realizations of topological flatbands with @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , it is interesting to address the issue what conditions can make the biqh stable against possible competing phases , like charge density wave and bosonic superfluid .",
    "if the system can host other competing phases under certain conditions , it opens a door to explore quantum phase transition between biqh and other phases . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the low energy theory describing continuous phase transitions between superfluid and biqh is constructed from fermionic parton .    in this paper , we study the generalized hofstadter model and address the stability of the biqh against other phases , taking into account the effects of interaction strength , band topology and their interplay within the full real space hamiltonian .",
    "we find that the many - body ground state is indeed biqh for hardcore bosons at integer filling of @xmath2 band with a robust spectrum gap , due to onsite hubbard repulsion . without onsite hubbard repulsion ,",
    "the softcore bosons would undergo a bose - condensation into the lowest single particle orbit .",
    "increasing the nearest neighbor interaction to strong repulsion , a charge density wave state would dominate over the biqh state .",
    "when tuning the next nearest neighbor hopping down to zero , the chern number of the lowest band becomes @xmath5 and we show that the ground state would have a transition into a metallic liquid - like phase in this case .",
    "thus , the emergence of biqh phase in single component bosons on lattice model is ultimately related to the interplay of interaction and band topology .",
    "experimentally , the bosonic hofstadter model has been realized by laser - assisted tunneling in cold atoms  @xcite , and a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is observed in this cold atom setup  @xcite . in relation to current experiments ,",
    "we discuss an experimental prospect toward realization of biqh state in optical lattices and further predict that once a stronger next nearest neighbor hopping can be implemented in this setup , one may realize the many - body biqh state in such a generalized hofstadter model and study the quantum phase transition between bose condensate and biqh phase by tuning the onsite interaction between bosons through lattice potential or feshbach resonances  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "our calculations confirm that the obtained ground state does not mix with the higher energy levels , demonstrating itself as the unique ground state under the insertion of the flux @xmath41 .",
    "the many - body chern number of the ground state wavefunction @xmath42 at @xmath34 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the berry curvature . by numerically calculating the berry curvatures using @xmath45 mesh points in boundary phase space with @xmath46 as shown in fig .",

    "<S> we study the interacting bosons in topological hofstadter bands with chern number two . using exact diagonalization </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that bosonic integer quantum hall ( biqh ) state emerges at integer boson filling factor @xmath0 of the lowest chern band with evidences including a robust spectrum gap and quantized topological hall conductance two . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the robustness of biqh state against different interactions and next - nearest neighbor hopping is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the strong nearest neighbor interaction would favor a charge density wave . when the onsite interaction decreases , biqh state undergoes a continuous transition into a superfluid state . without next - nearest neighbor hopping , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is possibly in a metallic fermi - liquid - like phase . </S>"
