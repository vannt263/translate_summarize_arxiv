    "<S> we compare the frequency - domain analysis of the finite - size random orthogonal model ( rom ) above the mode coupling temperature with the above scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation for this study was to make a stringent test on the rom as a possible toy - model for the fragile - glass scenario . </S>",
    "<S> model hamiltonians capable of describing relaxation processes in supercooled liquids and structural glasses are difficult to obtain . however , starting with the work of kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes ( kirkpatrick and thirumalai 1987a , b , kirkpatrick and wolynes 1987 ) in the late 80 s , it is now clear that there is a close analogy between some mean - field spin - glass models and structural glasses ( bouchaud _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic simplification occurring in mean - field models is that in the limit of a very large ( @xmath8 ) number of spin one is left with a closed set of equations for the two - time correlation and response functions which , above a critical temperature @xmath9 , are equivalent to the schematic mode coupling equations introduced by leutheusser , gtze and others ( bengtzelius _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> the barrier separating different ergodic components diverges in the mean - field limit , hence at the critical temperature @xmath9 a real ergodic to non - ergodic transition takes place with diverging relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature @xmath9 coincides with the critical temperature @xmath10 derived in the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) and in what follows we will use only the notation @xmath10 . in a real system , however , barriers are of finite height and the glass transition appears at @xmath11 where the typical activation time over barriers is of the same order of the observation time . in these systems @xmath10 represents the temperature below which the dynamics is dominated by activated hopping over energy barries . therefore to go beyond mean - field it is necessary to include activated processes , a very difficult task since it implies the knowledge of excitations involved in the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have shown that activated processes in mean - field models could be included just keeping @xmath12 finite ( crisanti and ritort 2000a , b ) , giving support to the scenario of the fragile glass transition developed from spin - glass models . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a trivial assumption since it is not _ a priori _ clear why excitations in mean - field spin glass models should have similar properties to those of supercooled liquids . </S>",
    "<S> this , for example , seems to be the case for the random orthogonal model ( rom ) ( marinari _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> this value does not depend on the system size for the sizes we studied . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the present results show that finite - size mean - field spin glasses capture the cooperative effects responsible for the relaxational processes observed in glass forming liquids when approaching the mode - coupling temperature from above . </S>",
