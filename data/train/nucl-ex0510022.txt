    "one of the most remarkable observations in central heavy ion collisions at rhic is a large enhancement of baryons and antibaryons at intermediate @xmath0 @xmath1 2 - 5",
    "gev / c , while neutral pions and inclusive charged hadrons are strongly suppressed compared to p+p collisions .",
    "the ( anti)proton to pion ratio is enhanced by almost a factor of 3 when one compares most central au+au events to peripheral or p+p events . in this @xmath0 region ,",
    "fragmentation process dominates the particle production in p+p collisions .",
    "it is expected that the fragmentation is independent of the collision system , - hence the large baryon fraction observed at rhic comes with a surprise .",
    "this behavior is usually called `` baryon anomaly at rhic '' . by performing a control experiment - d+au collisions , in which only cold nuclear matter is produced",
    ", we found that the suppression of particle yields comes from not the initial state interactions , but the final state interactions ( i.e. jet quenching ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed enhancement is explained in some different ways : ( 1 ) strong radial flow which pushes the heavier particles to larger @xmath0 @xcite , ( 2 ) recombination of shower quarks with quarks from the thermalized medium @xcite .",
    "to investigate the origin of this anomaly , we use the several data sets from the past rhic runs , including a new data set of cu+cu collisions taken in 2005 by phenix experiment .",
    "the data set allows us to study the collision energy and system size dependences of the hadron production .",
    "data presented here includes au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev , and au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 62.4 gev .",
    "events with vertex position along the beam axis within @xmath3 @xmath4 30 cm were triggered by the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) located at @xmath5 = 3.0 - 3.9 .",
    "using bbc , the triggered events are classified in collision centrality .",
    "charged particles are reconstructed at mid - rapidity @xmath5 @xmath4 0.35 using a drift chamber and multi - wire proportional chambers with pad readout .",
    "particle identification is based on particle mass calculated from the measured momentum and the velocity obtained from time - of - flight and path length along the trajectory .",
    "the measurement uses the time - of - flight detector with the resolution of @xmath6 @xmath1 130 ps .",
    "corrections to the charged particle spectrum for geometrical acceptance , decay in flight , reconstruction efficiency , and momentum resolution are determined using a single - particle geant monte carlo simulation .",
    "multiplicity - dependent corrections are evaluated by embedding simulated tracks into real events .",
    "any feed - down corrections from weak decays are not applied to these results .",
    "the detailed analysis methods are found in @xcite .",
    "to study the excitation function of hadron production at the beam energy between sps and rhic , the data in @xmath2 = 62.4 gev in au+au was taken .",
    "this lower energy data provides an important information on the baryon production and transport at mid - rapidity between sps and rhic .",
    "figure  [ fig : ppi_62_200 ] shows the p/@xmath9 and @xmath10/@xmath11 ratios in central au+au collisons at 62.4 gev and 200 gev @xcite . comparing to the 200 gev data , the 62.4 gev data shows a slightly larger proton contribution at intermediate @xmath0 , while there is a less antiproton contribution",

    "it is consistent with the preliminary @xmath12/@xmath13 ratio measured by star .",
