    "almost forty years after the original computations of colgate & white ( 1966 ) and arnett ( 1967 ) , it is still not known exactly how core collapse supernovae explode .",
    "quite early on it became clear that the prompt shock that follows the bounce of the core stagnates , leading to a standing shock at a distance of several hundred km from the center .",
    "the region interior to the shock contains hot material that settles onto the central core , while the exterior contains infalling matter .",
    "unless some additional energy source is available to energize the post - shock gas , the shock will ultimately run out of energy and we would have a failed explosion .    during the mid eighties , wilson ( 1985 ) and",
    "bethe & wilson ( 1985 ; see also goodman , dar & nussinov 1987 ) suggested that late time neutrino heating , about a second after the bounce , could lead to a revival of the shock and to ejection of the infalling envelope .",
    "however , later calculations indicated that this late neutrino heating might be insufficient .",
    "the fact that the explosion energy ( a few foe @xmath3 erg ) is much smaller than the binding energy of the neutron star ( a few hundred foe ) gave some hope that small details in the calculations may change the result , leaving open the possibility that yet more sophisticated calculations might ultimately produce an explosion .",
    "however , recent detailed computations , carried out by different groups with improved neutrino transport and fully relativistic hydrodynamics ( bruenn 1985 ; bruenn & mezzacappa 1997 ; bruenn , de nisco , & mezzacappa 2001 ; liebendorfer et al . 2001 , 2004 ; mezzacappa , et al . 2001",
    "; myra & burrows , 1990 ; rampp & janka 2000 ; thompson , burrows & pinto 2003 ) , have demonstrated conclusively that one - dimensional , i.e. , spherically - symmetric , simulations do not lead to a supernova ( see burrows & thompson , 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "a consensus has emerged that the coupling efficiency of the emerging neutrinos to the mantle is too small to lead to an explosion , so that the failure to explode is not an artifact of inaccurate calculations .",
    "the neutrinos simply do not transfer enough energy to the mantle , and something else is required beyond one - dimensional collapse and neutrino transport ( see e.g. burrows & thompson , 2002 ) .",
    "two - dimensional calculations carried out in the mid nineties ( herant et al .",
    "1994 ; burrows , hayes & fryxell , 1995 ; janka & muller , 1996 ; fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) resulted in successful supernovae .",
    "these calculations also revealed turbulence in the collapsing gas , and it was suggested that the explosion was the result of an enhancement of the coupling between the neutrinos and the mantle due to the turbulence ( burrows & thompson , 2002 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear at present whether or not the results are an artifact of the simplified transport models used in the simulations .",
    "it is also unclear if the two - dimensional turbulence seen in the calculations provides a realistic description of full three - dimensional turbulence ( see e.g. , fryer & warren 2002 , 2004 ) .    in view of this confusing situation",
    ", it would be wise to search for additional energy sources that might transport energy to the mantle and lead to an explosion .",
    "burrows & goshy ( 1993 ) describe the explosion problem in terms of the neutrino luminosity needed to produce an explosion at a given mass accretion rate . clearly , what is important is the energy flux , whether it is via neutrinos or something else .",
    "in fact , energy in a form other than neutrinos is likely to be superior since it might couple more efficiently to the matter in the mantle erg ( burrows & thompson 2002 ) . ] .",
    "two energy sources that have been mentioned a number of times in connection with the supernova problem are magnetic fields ( le blanc & wilson , 1970 ; moiseenko , bisnovatyi - kogan & ardeljan 2004 ; kotake et al . 2004 ; wheeler , meier & wilson 2002 ) and rotation .",
    "rotation has been discussed as the cause of asymmetry in the explosion and also in the context of generating gravitational waves .",
    "recent progress in numerical computations have enabled modeling rotating collapse with a realistic equation of state and neutrino transport in two dimensions ( fryer & heger 2000 ; kotake , yamada & sato 2003 ; livne et al.,2004 ; walder et al .",
    "2004 ; and references therein ) and even three dimensions ( fryer & warren 2004 ; janka et al . 2004 ) .",
    "some of these studies indicate that rotation may cause a weakening of two - dimensional convection and thereby delay the explosion ( fryer & heger , 2000 ) .",
    "however , more work is needed before one can be sure of the net effect of rotation on supernova explosions .",
    "we discuss in this paper a novel scenario , based on rotation , which does not seem to have been considered before .",
    "we suggest that a core - collapse supernova may be partially driven by wind energy from an accretion disk that forms around the proto - neutron star ( inside the stalled shock ) .",
    "such a disk is expected to form if the pre - explosion stellar core rotates reasonably rapidly .",
    "the required progenitor rotation rate for our scenario to work is comparable to , or perhaps even larger than , the rates predicted in current stellar evolution models ( e.g. , heger et al .",
    "2000 , 2004 ) . however , there are large uncertainties in the stellar model calculations .    in our model , because of the high angular momentum of the stellar gas , the infalling matter arranges itself into a dense and very hot disk in the form of a neutrino dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ; popham , woosley & fryer 1999 ; narayan , piran & kumar 2001 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ; di matteo , perna & narayan 2002 )  . for a wide range of parameter space ,",
    "an ndaf is advection - dominated and is expected to emit a substantial wind .",
    "we propose that the mechanical energy transported out by this wind will be transferred to the gas inside the stalled shock , reviving the shock and leading to a successful explosion .",
    "related ideas have been discussed by macfadyen ( 2003 ) and thompson , quataert & burrows ( 2004 ) .",
    "note that the wind that we consider originates from the disk and is different from the spherical wind originating from the proto - neutron star itself discussed by thompson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    ",
    "2 of the paper presents a detailed discussion of the structure of the ndaf that forms during core collapse .",
    "the model we employ for the calculations is more elaborate than those described in the recent literature ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ; narayan et al . 2001 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ) , and we highlight the improvements . some of the relevant physics is described in appendices  a and b. these structure equations are applicable to an ndaf residing in the core of a collapsar ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) and may be of use for numerical simulations of collapsars .",
    "the reader who is not interested in the technical details and wishes to read about the application to supernovae is invited to skip   2 and to go directly to   3 , where we calculate the mechanical energy that is likely to be carried in the disk wind .",
    "even with fairly conservative assumptions , we show that up to about @xmath1 erg of energy might be available in the wind .",
    "we suggest that this energy would help to energize the stalled post - bounce shock in a supernova .",
    "the material in the wind may also participate in @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "  4 concludes with a discussion .",
    "in this paper we use the following dimensionless variables for the mass of the compact star @xmath4 , the accretion rate @xmath5 and the radius @xmath6 : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the schwarzschild radius .",

    "[ eq : mdot2 ] ) ( see frank et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the rate of loss of energy by cooling has four contributions : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the radiative cooling rate , @xmath91 is the cooling rate by photodissociation of heavy nuclei , @xmath92 is the advective energy transport ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) , and @xmath93 is the cooling rate due to neutrino loss .",

    "the above expression is based on the work of popham & narayan ( 1995 ) and is designed to operate in both the optically very thin and optically very thick limits .",
    "it represents a bridging formula between these two limits and provides a reasonable estimate of the cooling rate in the difficult but important intermediate regime where @xmath46 is of order a few .",
    "note that the optical depths discussed above provide some information on whether or not neutrinos are thermalized in the electromagnetic thermal bath ( provided the timescale for collisions is shorter than the dynamical timescale .",
    "we find that the timescale for neutrino collisions is much shorter than the dynamical timescale in the parameter space where the optical depths are larger than 2/3 . ] ) .",
    "because we do not explicitly solve the boltzmann equation for the time evolution of the energy distribution of neutrinos and the energy transfer , we conservatively regard the above neutrino optical depths as an indicator of the degree of thermalization of neutrinos .",
    "that is , when all the @xmath46 s are larger than 2/3 , we assume the neutrinos to be thermalized .    for the other scattering processes except neutrino - nucleon scattering ( @xmath159 ) , there also exists the possibility of elastic scattering off background electrons ( positrons ) , @xmath160 .",
    "the energy dependence ( or temperature dependence ) of this reaction rate is similar to that of neutrino - nucleon collisions .",

    "[ fig : xnuc_np_p_ne_panel ]  ( a ) , the photodissociation of nuclei in the accretion flow acts as an effective cooling term . correspondingly , the recombination of nucleons into nuclei in the outflow is exothermic and increases the energy available in the outflow .",
    "the energy release is about 8 mev per nucleon ( macfadyen 2003 ) , which is substantial .",
    "this energy was not included in the energy estimates obtained in the previous subsections .",
    "figure  [ fig : e2dotcontour_panel ] shows how those results are modified when the recombination energy is included . in the new calculations ,",
    "the outflowing gas at each radius is assumed to start off with @xmath106 equal to the value given in equation  ( [ eq : xnuc ] ) , and the energy release from this material is calculated assuming that each free nucleon releases 8 mev through recombination .",
    "the particular case shown is for @xmath311 .",
    "a comparison with figure  [ fig : edotcontour_panel ] shows that the recombination energy is quite substantial . without including this energy , for @xmath311",
    "the maximum efficiency of the outflow for the optimum choice of @xmath183 and @xmath312 is only @xmath313 , whereas with the recombination energy included the efficiency can become as high as @xmath314 .    another interesting possibility is suggested by fig .  [ fig : xnuc_np_p_ne_panel ]  ( b ) , where we see that the neutron to proton ratio in the disk is quite high over large regions of parameter space . such a neutron rich region with a short dynamical timescale ( @xmath180 ) is likely to be the site of @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis ( hoffman , woosley & qian 1997 ) .",
    "-decay , we need a large neutron flux @xmath315 .",
    "our model easily satisfies this condition . ]",
    "the interesting thing in our model is that the neutron rich material flows out as part of the advection - induced wind . during the outflow ,",
    "@xmath2-process elements could be generated and these will be ejected by the supernova explosion .",
    "this possibility has been explored by various authors within the context of gamma - ray bursts and the collapsar model ( pruet et al .",
    "2003 , 2004a , b ; fujimoto et al . 2004 ; surman & mclaughlin 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "our proposal is that similar considerations should apply also in the context of regular supernovae .",
    "it should be noted that there is at present no accepted model for successful @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis ( see recent papers by qian & wasserburg 2002 and qian 2005 ) . from the viewpoint of event rates , the core - collapse supernova is a more likely site for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis than the binary neutron star merger ( eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; freiburghaus et al .",
    "this is because even in metal poor stars with fe / fe@xmath316 = @xmath317  @xmath318 , typical @xmath2-process elements such as eu have been discovered ( see mcwilliam et al .",
    "this means that @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis must happen on the same timescale as fe production in supernovae .",
    "standard explosive nucleosynthesis in core - collapse supernovae can produce only the lighter @xmath2-process elements with mass number @xmath319 , such as rh and ag .",
    "some other mechanism is needed to produce the heavier @xmath2-process elements with @xmath320 .",
    "moreover , this mechanism should not produce too much light @xmath2-process elements .",
    "if it did , we would have difficulty explaining the fact that , among metal poor stars , there is a variation of the abundance of the heavier @xmath2-process elements with @xmath320 whereas the abundances of the elements from o to ge and the lighter @xmath2-process elements up to ag are unchanged ( qian 2005 ) . in standard models of core - collapsed supernovae , neutron rich regions suitable for",
    "@xmath2-process synthesis do exist , but the problem is that these regions generally do not flow out but rather fall back on the proto - neutron star .",
    "although the possibility that a neutrino driven wind may eject the neutron rich region has been studied , at least one of the following conditions has to been satisfied : ( i ) low lepton fraction @xmath321 , ( ii ) short dynamical timescale , and ( iii ) large entropy per baryon . to our knowledge , these conditions have not been achieved naturally in supernova wind models ( hoffman , woosley & qian 1997 )  .",
    "another idea that has been considered by some workers is accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) as a candidate site for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis ( qian & wasserburg 2002 ) .",
    "it is reported that this scenario produces heavier elements with @xmath320 without overproducing the lighter elements .",
    "we can not judge whether or not the necessary conditions are naturally realized .    in comparison to these other models",
    ", the disk wind model we propose here appears to be plausible and quite natural .",
    "the main selling point of this model is that we can easily bring the neutron rich material and @xmath2-process elements out during the core - collapse supernova explosion .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , if an accretion disk  an ndaf  forms around a proto - neutron star during core collapse of a massive progenitor star , then a substantial quantity of mass is likely to be ejected from the disk and to carry with it a large amount of mechanical energy .",
    "the outflow energy could be as much as @xmath1 erg in favorable situations and might be sufficient to convert a failed supernova explosion into a successful one .",
    "a virtue of this proposal is that essentially all the energy is available to power the explosion .",
    "this is in contrast to neutrino - driven supernovae where only a small fraction of the energy is deposited in the stellar mantle .",
    "we have estimated the energy in the outflow corresponding to two distinct scenarios . in one scenario (   [ subsec : application1 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : tinteg_prompt_panel ] ) , we assume that the disk forms as part of the initial core collapse and that the outflow induces a prompt supernova explosion . in the second scenario (   [ subsec : application2 ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : tinteg_panel ] ) , we assume that there is no prompt explosion and that the shock stalls .",
    "however , some of the subsequent fallback material forms a disk whose outflowing wind re - energizes the shock and causes a delayed supernova explosion .",
    "depending on the parameters we assume , primarily the amount of mass available in the disk , both the above scenarios are feasible for producing a supernova explosion .",
    "however , the second scenario ( which leads to a delayed explosion ) appears to be more promising for two reasons .",
    "first , the total amount of fallback mass in a failed supernova can be several solar masses ( essentially all the mass in the envelope of the progenitor star ) whereas the mass in the initial prompt disk is likely to be no more than a few tenths of a solar mass .",
    "thus , the mass and energy budget is much larger in the delayed scenario .",
    "second , the delayed fallback material is likely to have larger specific angular momentum since it originates from farther out in the progenitor star .",
    "thus , this material is more likely to form a disk .",
    "the results shown in figures  [ fig : tinteg_prompt_panel ] and [ fig : tinteg_panel ] are conservative in that they do not include the additional energy that is released when the dissociated nucleons in the outflowing gas recombine to form larger nuclei .",
    "the latter process releases about 8 mev per nucleon ( macfadyen 2003 ) which can be a substantial fraction of the total outflow energy for certain parameter choices .",
    "figure  [ fig : e2dotcontour_panel ] shows how the results shown in figure  [ fig : edotcontour_panel ] are modified when the recombination energy is included .",
    "the difference is quite large , especially when the energy efficiency factor @xmath204 of the outflow is small , say @xmath322 .",
    "this makes the scenario proposed in this paper even more promising .",
    "although we have taken pains to model the physics of the ndaf in as much detail as possible , the numerical results we have obtained are still only crude estimates .",
    "this is because there are several large uncertainties in the model which we have had to absorb in various free parameters . in both the prompt and delayed scenarios",
    ", we have no firm estimate of how much mass goes into the disk .",
    "the mass depends on the angular momentum distribution of the progenitor star , which is poorly understood . also",
    ", we do not know how much of the mass in the disk flows out in the wind . while it is generally understood that advection - dominated accretion flows are likely to have strong outflows ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a ) , the exact amount of outflow is uncertain .",
    "we have included an index @xmath208 plus an approximate prescription for how the index varies with the degree of advection - domination in the accretion flow ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_r ] ) ) .",
    "finally , we do not have a precise estimate of the specific energy of the outflowing gas .",
    "we make the plausible assumption that the energy is a fraction @xmath323 of the escape energy , but there are no strong constraints on the value of @xmath204 .    despite these large uncertainties",
    ", we believe our calculations are realistic enough to demonstrate that there is likely to be considerable energy in the outflow .",
    "one question to ask is : where exactly does the energy come from ?",
    "the responsible agency is gravity , helped by viscosity ( or more accurately shear stress in the accretion flow ) . as is well - known ( e.g. , frank et al . 1992 ) , viscosity has three important effects on an accretion flow .",
    "\\(i ) viscosity induces a shear stress which transports angular momentum outward , enabling mass to flow in .",
    "this is obviously critical for the whole accretion process to occur in the first place .",
    "the `` viscosity '' is likely to be generated via the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) viscous dissipation heats up the gas locally .",
    "if this heat is radiated immediately , then the gas remains cold and its binding energy is approximately @xmath324 ( in the newtonian limit ) , i.e. , it is equal to half the local potential energy . such highly bound gas is not easily ejected and we do not expect a significant wind from the disk .",
    "if the heat energy is not radiated , i.e. , if the flow is advection - dominated , then the gas is much more loosely bound to the central mass ; in fact , the gas is actually unbound as we discuss below in ( iii ) .",
    "an adaf is thus expected to have heavy mass loss , as originally highlighted by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995a ) .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , viscosity transports energy outward .",
    "the outward energy flux is given by @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is the local shear stress ( which transports angular momentum outward ) and @xmath327 is the local angular velocity of the gas . in the case of an adaf , this outward transport of energy is extremely important . as we discussed above in ( ii ) , the gas in an adaf does not lose any of its initial binding energy because it is radiatively inefficient .",
    "now , we see that , in addition , it acquires extra energy from gas further in through viscous energy transport .",
    "the net result is that the gas in an adaf ends up with _ positive _ energy ( or negative binding energy ) .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995a ) explicitly demonstrated this by estimating the bernoulli parameter of the gas and showing that this quantity is positive for a self - similar adaf .",
    "the positive energy drives the outflow and deposits energy in the surroundings .",
    "where does the energy come from ? ultimately , it comes from the gravitational potential energy released by the gas that falls onto the compact star on the inside .",
    "the above discussion establishes the strong connection between advection - dominated accretion and outflowing winds .",
    "therefore , the mechanism we have described will not operate unless the accretion flow is strongly advection - dominated",
    ". fortunately , adaf - like conditions are present over a wide range of parameter space in an ndaf ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f ] ) .",
    "equally , the mechanism will not operate in a numerical simulation of a supernova explosion unless one includes viscosity self - consistently and keeps track of the energy that is transported and dissipated viscously .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "viscous interactions have not been properly incorporated in most supernova simulations done so far .",
    "an exception to this statement is the work of fryer & heger ( 2000 ) which investigated rotating collapse with the inclusion of @xmath87-viscosity . while there is some evidence for outflowing gas in their simulation ( see their fig .",
    "14 ) , nevertheless , the energy carried by the wind is apparently not very important because the authors find that the supernova explosion develops more slowly in a rotating star compared to a non - rotating star . without knowing all the details of the simulation , it is difficult to say why this work did not find the energetic wind that we predict .",
    "values of @xmath87 over the range 0.1 to 0.0001 were apparently used and this may be a clue . comparing figures 8 and 9 of the present paper , we see that when @xmath87 is reduced from 0.1 to 0.01 , the range of @xmath83 over which the wind is relatively inefficient ( because the accretion flow is relatively efficient at radiating neutrinos ) increases substantially .",
    "the reason for this is explained in   3.2 . for yet smaller values of @xmath87 such as those mentioned in fryer & heger ( 2000 )",
    ", the effect would be even more enhanced .",
    "it is thus possible that the viscosity employed by fryer & heger ( 2000 ) was too weak to exhibit the effects we have described .",
    "it is also possible that the progenitors they used did not rotate fast enough to develop a substantial accretion disk around the proto neutron star .",
    "regardless , once three - dimensional simulations of rotating collapse are done with full mhd ( so that the magnetorotational instability is able to develop and provide `` viscosity '' self - consistently ) , the effects we have described in this paper ought to be seen . the work of proga et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and moseenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is a beginning in this direction .",
    "it should be noted that the outflows we consider here are distinct from the relativistic jets that are popular in collapsar models of gamma - ray bursts ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) or that are invoked in some models of supernovae ( wheeler et al .",
    "our outflows are relatively slow .",
    "even the gas that is ejected from the innermost region of the disk has a speed only @xmath328 ( its kinetic energy is @xmath329 ) ; the gas that comes out from larger radii is even slower .",
    "also , we do not expect the outflow to be highly collimated as visualized in jet models . in our view , if at all an ultrarelativistic jet is present , it is likely to be produced by some mechanism that is completely different from the disk outflow we have considered .",
    "the mechanism will probably be related to the compact object in the middle and not the disk . of course",
    ", a fraction of the jet energy may contribute to re - energizing the stalled shock ( wheeler et al .",
    "2002 ) and may assist the disk outflow in producing the explosion . equally , the disk outflow that we discuss here may help , or even play an important role , in the collimation of the relativistic jet .",
    "an important point to note is that the outflow discussed in this paper has a clear direction associated with it , namely the rotation axis of the system .",
    "the impact of this non - spherical wind on the stalled shock is likely to result in an asymmetric explosion for which there is growing evidence from polarization observations of supernovae ( wheeler et al . , 2000 ;",
    "wang et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "finally , we note that several regions in the disk have a large neutron to proton ratio . because of the short dynamical timescale , these neutron - rich regions are candidate sites for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis . in our model , the neutron - rich gas and the @xmath2-process elements that it synthesizes",
    "are naturally transported out by the outflow and ejected in the supernova explosion .",
    "the model may thus be of interest for studies of the origin of @xmath2-process elements in the universe ( pruet et al .",

    "here we compare the timescale of the various scattering processes with the dynamical timescale in the system .",
    "the dynamical timescale is represented by the accretion time , @xmath330 for reference , if we simply assume that the disk half - thickness is @xmath331 ( as appropriate for an adaf ) , then the dynamical timescale is approximately given by @xmath332 .",
    "the timescale of the scattering rates among photons and electrons is much faster than the accretion timescale because of the electromagnetic interaction ( thomson scattering ) , i.e. , @xmath333 , with thomson cross section @xmath334 .",
    "therefore , we obviously expect that photons and electrons interact each other rapidly and are immediately thermalized .",
    "on the other hand , neutrinos with energy @xmath335 scatter off the background nucleons and electrons only through the weak interaction .",
    "the reaction rates of these scattering processes are roughly estimated by @xmath336 note that this rate is of the same order of magnitude as that of neutrino - antineutrino pair production by background electron - positron annihilation @xmath337 .",
    "thus , the timescale of scattering ( or the pair - production ) is @xmath338^{{-1}}$ ] .",

    "the expressions of the rates are presented in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : beta_reac1 ] )    ( [ eq : beta_reac6 ] ) . in particular , electron capture by a proton and positron capture by a neutron are important to interconvert neutrons and protons in the electromagnetic thermal bath .",
    "this is because these processes are effective even when the neutrino - nucleon scattering in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : beta_reac4 ] )    ( [ eq : beta_reac6 ] ) is ineffective due to insufficient thermalization of background neutrinos .",

    "here we discuss the approximations we use to calculate the neutron to proton ratio @xmath57 in this study . ideally , we should solve the balance equation of the interconverting reactions between neutrons and protons written down in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dnpdt ] ) and ( [ eq : dnndt ] ) .",
    "however , let us make some bold but reasonable approximations since the exact calculations require intensive computations and are not needed for our current purpose .",
    "we classify the @xmath2-@xmath164 plane into following three regions : ( i ) the region where neutrinos are completely thermalized and the timescale for the interconverting reaction @xmath348 is much smaller than the dynamical timescale , ( ii ) the region where @xmath349 is rapid but the the thermalization of neutrinos is incomplete and the neutrino - nucleon scattering is unimportant , and ( iii ) the region where @xmath349 is slow compared to the dynamical timescale .",
    "we discuss each of the three cases in detail .",
    "fist of all , it is necessary to know the distribution functions of electrons and neutrinos , which govern the balance equations of the interconverting reactions . as we have discussed in appendix  [",
    "sec : timescale ] , the thermalization of electrons is easily realized because the electromagnetic interaction is very rapid compared to the dynamical timescale .",
    "on the other hand the thermalization of neutrinos is not obvious .",
    "the problem is that neutrinos scatter off the background particles such as electrons , nucleons or neutrinos only through the weak interaction . for accurate results",

    ", we adopt the following approximate method which does not involve explicitly solving the boltzmann equations . when both @xmath350 and @xmath351 are much larger than @xmath352 , it is reasonable to expect that neutrinos are completely thermalized , so we assume this .",
    "the corresponding parameter regime is clearly shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tau_nue_panel](a )  and  ( b ) for the electron neutrinos .",
    "in addition , from fig .  [",
    "fig : timesale_panel ]  ( a ) , we see that the timescale of such scatterings through @xmath353 ( @xmath354 , and @xmath355 ) is much more rapid than the dynamical timescale . therefore , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : npratio_eq ] ) , we obtain @xmath356 as the thermal equilibrium value of the neutron to proton ratio ( case  ( i ) ) .",
    "if the electron neutrinos are not thermalized , i.e. , if the optical depths @xmath175 and @xmath176 are less than 2/3 in the current context , it would be reasonable to regard that the neutrino - nucleon scatterings in eqs .",
