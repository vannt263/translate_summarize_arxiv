    "the theory of disordered quantum systems aims to understand transport in a wide range of paradigms in condensed matter physics .",
    "this is due in large part to the seminal work of anderson in 1958 @xcite who found that sufficiently strong disorder was enough to completely localize an electron on a disordered lattice leading to the absence of diffusion .",
    "the lack of transport for sufficiently strong disorder , and its absence in one and two dimensions remains under intense investigation since its original inception @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of many - body localization ( mbl ) is when localization , and hence complete suppression of diffusion , persists even in the presence of interactions .",
    "this persistence was first described in the seminal work of basko , aleiner and altshuler ( baa ) @xcite and was surprising given that the general consensus was that interactions should lead to collisional dephasing and hence delocalization .",
    "furthermore , baa showed that the localized phase is stable to weak interactions . following this impetus ,",
    "the past decade has seen a surge of studies related to the properties of the mbl phase @xcite , its rich phenomenology @xcite , including emergent integrability @xcite , various approximation methods to numerically analyse its properties @xcite , and the presence of a many - body mobility edge @xcite .",
    "the ergodic region , however , has received less attention , firstly because the numerics is more demanding and secondly the expectation is that the ergodic phase is generic and hence less  interesting \" than the newly discovered mbl phase .",
    "however recent works have pointed towards a highly nontrivial ergodic region . in the ergodic region of mbl",
    "hamiltonians the entanglement dynamics is characterized by a power - law growth of entanglement entropy @xcite ( contrasting with logarithmic growth in the localized region @xcite ) . in terms of the transport of conserved quantities ,",
    "evidence has mounted for a regime of sub - diffusion for the spin transport in the ergodic phase @xcite , as well as the presence of griffiths rare regions close to the transition leading to anomalous power laws in certain spectral functions @xcite .",
    "a more extensive regime of sub - diffusion was predicted in @xcite .",
    "kim and huse have previously demonstrated , in an ergodic but not disordered spin chain , that the entanglement grows linearly with time while the energy is transported diffusively @xcite .    in this study , we provide strong evidence that _ there is a considerable portion of the ergodic phase where energy transport is diffusive but breaks down well before the many - body localisation transition_. in the mbl phase we see , as expected , that there is no energy transfer , neither diffusive nor sub - diffusive .",
    "moreover earlier works have argued for anomalous spin transport throughout the ergodic phase @xcite ; such a situation where energy and spin excitations are transported at different rates can occur if they are decoupled or weakly coupled leading to different transit times across the insulating or critical griffiths islands , with the effect being exponentially exacerbated in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "taken together this finding points towards a highly nontrivial ergodic region where particles do not diffuse but energy does , reminiscent of the situation in amorphous solids ( glasses ) @xcite and the gapped phase of the anisotropic heisenberg chain @xcite .",
    "this could be related to the possible existence of a so - called _ non - ergodic extended _ phase in the anderson problem on the bethe lattice or in high dimension @xcite . moreover , comparing to the results of the recent work @xcite , we find that the energy diffusion breaks down almost exactly when the entropy spread becomes sub - diffusive , a manifestation of the entanglement entropy growth dominating the growth of correlation functions of physical observables .",
    "the hamiltonian of what is by now the standard model to study many - body localization - delocalization transition @xcite is given by @xmath1 where the @xmath2 represent static fields on each site @xmath3 uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath4 $ ] and the spins @xmath5 are spin-1/2 representations of the @xmath6 algebra . in what follows we set @xmath7 and denote the hilbert space size by @xmath8 .",
    "we recall that numerical work shows a transition to a fully many - body localized phase when @xmath9 exceeds @xmath10 @xcite although this number might be larger @xcite . for all values of the model parameters ,",
    "the model conserves the total spin @xmath11 along the @xmath12 direction ; in the rest of the work we have chosen the subspace with @xmath13 . this model is equivalent ( after jordan - wigner transformation ) to that of fermions with nearest - neighbour density - density interactions hopping on a lattice ( the @xmath13 subspace corresponds to half filling ) .    in this work we are interested in the dynamics of a specially constructed initial state which has an inhomogeneous energy density .",
    "we are motivated by the primary question of whether `` hot '' and `` cold '' regions in a given isolated quantum system can effectively act as a bath for itself , resulting in thermalization .",
    "we will also see how well a hydrodynamic description of the system fares . to this end",
    "we employ two protocols : _ a ) _ we build a close - to - infinite temperature density matrix with a sine - wave energy lump in the energy density profile .",
    "this follows the technique used in @xcite to create a magnetization imbalance ; and _ b ) _ we construct a pure initial state with a macroscopic energy imbalance and observe its equilibration .",
    "both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages . in the sine - wave energy",
    "lump the system is in linear - response regime and we can control the wave number of the initial perturbation @xmath14 but we can not treat large system sizes and are limited at @xmath15 . in the second framework the system is in the fully nonlinear response regime and we can not control the initial perturbation but , after a transient , we can find the diffusion coefficient quite accurately and we can , using appropriate numerical techniques , simulate systems up to @xmath0 . in the first protocol , _ a ) _ : we will study a sinusoidal energy lump at infinite temperature constructed by starting with a single mode , mixed state density matrix ( evolving a density matrix instead of a pure state does not make a difference in the thermalizing phase ) @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the dimension of the zero magnetization subspace and the wave mode is @xmath18 . defining the local energy density @xmath19",
    "we have that @xmath20 with the amplitude @xmath21 ; the initial energy is thus distributed sinusoidally across the chain as can be seen in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ( the correction is small _ and _ independent of @xmath3 ) .    for the second protocol , _",
    "b ) _ , we initialise the state by cutting the chain defined by eq .   into two open half chains by switching off the boundary terms @xmath22 ( see fig .  [ fig:0 ] ) . an initial hamiltonian is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denote the hamiltonians for the left and right halves of the chain .",
    "we then choose an initial state which is a tensor product of the highest energy eigenstates of @xmath25 and the groundstate of @xmath26 so that @xmath27 ) .",
    "in this scenario evolving the state with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : heisenbergchain ] ) , assuming ergodic dynamics , should eventually allow for energy to flow from one side to the other one ( and thus for the system to thermalize ) .",
    "we can view the boundary term as a perturbation located at the two boundaries to try and understand the propagation of its effect in the spirit of the original work of baa @xcite .",
    "these boundary terms perturb the initial energy levels of the energy lump by @xmath28 , and therefore the relative mean - squared fluctuations in the energy are @xmath29 , thereby vanishing in the thermodynamic limit , demonstrating that most of the eigenstates @xmath30 appearing in the expansion @xmath31 are formed from the middle of the many - body spectrum .",
    "+ for these two high energy initial states , eq .  ( [ eq : dm2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : initialstate ] ) , the mbl transition point is predicted to be at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is expected that close to the transition , but within the ergodic side , the time scales for equilibration increase dramatically with the system size , i.e.  much faster than the @xmath33 predicted by the diffusion equation . in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show that these expectations are borne out .",
    "we first study the energy diffusion with initial condition given by a mixed state eq . through an analysis of the energy imbalance between the left and right halves of the chain .",
    "note that the initial condition for the single - mode density is independent of sample and disorder strength for a given system size @xmath34 because the @xmath12-field term does not contribute to the energy density : @xmath35 .",
    "the disorder - averaged results at disorder strength @xmath36 for an @xmath15 chain are displayed in the middle panel of fig . [",
    "the full red line denotes a fit to an exponential decay ( driving the equilibration process with a decay rate @xmath37 ) and a zeno transient @xcite described by a gaussian , @xmath38 with @xmath37 encapsulating the diffusion process ; such a fit models our entire data set for all system sizes considered for @xmath39 ; whereas for @xmath40 the full fits do not fare too well for @xmath41 , hence we use only truncated fits that ignores the zeno effects and captures only the dynamics prior to saturation as displayed in the figure .",
    "the left panel of the figure displays the energy profiles at various fixed times for these disorder strengths , illustrating how the sinusoidal shape of the @xmath14-mode is well retained .",
    "we scale the extracted diffusion constants @xmath42 with the inverse system size for a range of system sizes . as displayed in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we exponentially extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit ( although the errors in some of the fit parameters are quite large ) ; a clear discernible difference is apparent between the two cases as will be seen in the square - lump too : for @xmath43 whereas for @xmath44 suggesting diffusion in the former case and drastically suppressed diffusion ( or arguably even subdiffusion in the latter , where we find a power law extrapolation with zero offset works well too ) .",
    "we now turn to the second protocol of the square - wave lump in order to sharpen and corroborate the findings from the analysis of the single mode as initial state ; moreover here we can treat larger system sizes as explained previously .",
    "the time evolution of the disorder - averaged energy imbalance for system sizes @xmath45 are plotted in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for three regimes : ( a ) weak disorder limit @xmath46 , ( b ) close to the transition @xmath47 , and ( c ) deep in the localised phase @xmath48 ( recall that the critical value for the mbl transition is @xmath10 ) . + in the first case , @xmath46 , @xmath49 goes quickly to zero at long times , to a situation of a uniform energy density across the entire chain . in the third case @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 clearly does not decay in time .",
    "this is due to the lack of energy transfer which is expected in the mbl region , where there is no equilibration . in between the two cases , for @xmath47 for example , there is a very slow relaxation process governing the dynamics of the system .",
    "the analysis of the scaling of the diffusion coefficient here shows that the dynamics between @xmath47 and @xmath50 is at best sub - diffusive possibly with a continuously changing exponent .",
    "+ in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we display the energy profile across a chain of length @xmath51 at three different fixed times in the weak ( top plot ) and strong ( bottom plot ) disorder regimes . in the former case",
    "we see that there is energy equilibration at long times and the entire chain reaches a uniform energy density or temperature .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the strong disorder case where the spin chain is expected to be in the mbl phase : no transfer of energy is observed for a wide range of times and no effective temperature may be defined for the system @xcite .",
    "+ crucially we find that prior to saturation in the energy imbalance being achieved , there is , here too , a good fit of the dynamics with a simple diffusion process , which , pivotally , has only one fit parameter @xmath52 .",
    "these fit parameters are extracted and shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a function of disorder strength .",
    "we see that the diffusion constant decreases as the disorder is increased and is zero for @xmath53 , implying a breakdown of diffusion around this value and the possible onset of sub - diffusive energy transfer processes .",
    "the exponential infinite - size extrapolation fits are displayed in the inset by solid red lines at each disorder strength as a function of inverse system size .",
    "+ we also note the extrapolation of the values of @xmath54 obtained for the sinusoidal and square wave protocols are not in agreement within the statistical errors ( the discrepancy is about 30% at @xmath39 )",
    ". this can be due to an underestimation of @xmath54 for the square - wave case from the higher modes still being present there , or it could be due to an inaccurate extrapolation of the results from the small system sizes studied in the sinusoidal case ( recall that for the single - mode case the largest system size is @xmath15 , while for the square - wave it is @xmath55 ) .",
    "in summary , we have studied the quantum dynamics of inhomogeneous energy density profiles in a disordered heisenberg spin chain by means of a numerical krylov subspace technique .",
    "we have found that ( i ) energy transport is diffusive in an extended region of the delocalized phase and ( ii ) is transported either with exponentially suppressed diffusion or arguably even subdiffusively well before the transition to the localised phase .",
    "the first of our findings is in contrast with some of the existing literature @xcite ( where anomalous transport of entanglement entropy or energy is expected to occur throughout the entire ergodic phase ) but agrees qualitatively with findings from another work @xcite ( where deep in the ergodic phase energy is expected to be diffusive ) .",
    "this indicates that the existing phenomenology of the griffiths effects which accounts for transport in these systems needs to accommodate for the diffusion of one conserved quantity in the ergodic phase without it simultaneously aiding an _ equally fast _ thermalization of another conserved quantity .",
    "in fact after our work was completed , ref . - ",
    "@xcite was published , which contains an improved analysis of the renormalization group results and can accommodate the observations of our paper i.e. the coexistence of anomalous and normal diffusion in the ergodic phase .",
    "+ the second of our findings @xmath56 the observation of energy diffusion breaking down at @xmath57 , with a critical exponent @xmath58 , which is coincident , within numerical errors , with the point at which recent studies @xcite find the spreading of entanglement entropy to change from diffusive to sub - diffusive @xmath56 further points towards a more exotic ergodic phase which harbours two subphases with vastly differing dynamics of energy transport .",
    "subdiffusion of the energy which occurs between @xmath59 and @xmath60 should stop altogether beyond the mbl transition . +",
    "we have shown that a refined phenomenology of the heisenberg model with disorder is needed ( and possibly of other many - body localizable models ) including the possibility of a separate fully ergodic , diffusive phase and a sub - diffusive phase .",
