    "since their introduction by wishart @xcite in the 1920s in statistics , the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrix ensembles have played a major role in a variety of fields , especially in nuclear physics and number theory ; see for example the surveys @xcite and the textbooks @xcite .",
    "one of the central results in the subject is wigner s semi - circle law . inspired by studies of energy levels of heavy nuclei , wigner conjectured that their energy levels are well - modeled by eigenvalues of a random matrix ensemble , and he and others proved that in many matrix ensembles the distribution of the scaled eigenvalues of a typical matrix converge , in some sense , to the semi - circle distribution @xcite .",
    "which matrix ensemble models the system depends on its physical symmetries . though the most used in physics and number theory",
    "are the gaussian orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles , it is of interest to study other families . in many cases the additional symmetry constraints on the matrix ( for example , requiring it to be toeplitz or circulant or arising from a @xmath5-regular graph ) lead to a different density of states .",
    "there is now an extensive literature on the density of eigenvalues of special ensembles ; see for example @xcite , where many of them have limiting spectral measures different than the semi - circle ( though recent work , see @xcite among others , shows that in many cases the spacing between normalized eigenvalues is universal and equals that of the gaussian ensembles ) .    in many of these special ensembles while one is able to prove the density of eigenvalues of a typical matrix converges to a limiting spectral measure , one can not write down a nice , closed - form expression for this limiting distribution ( notable exceptions are @xmath5-regular graphs @xcite , block circulant matrices @xcite and palindromic toeplitz matrices @xcite ) . in what follows",
    "we study a new ensemble of ` checkerboard ' matrices , the eigenvalues of which are split into two types , each of which converges to a different limiting spectral distribution which can be solved for explicitly .",
    "most of the eigenvalues are of order @xmath6 and converge to a semi - circle ; however , a small number are of size @xmath7 and converge to new limiting measures related to the gaussian ensembles .",
    "we define these matrices in the next section , and then summarize our findings and the techniques developed to study such split behavior .",
    "our arguments apply with only minor modification to the reals , complex numbers and quaternions , and show connections between the checkerboard and gaussian ensembles .",
    "as we often use @xmath8 as an index of summation , we use @xmath9 and similarly @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the quaternions .",
    "additionally , we index the entries @xmath12 of a matrix starting at @xmath13 to simplify certain congruence conditions .",

    "we use @xmath31 throughout for simplicity , since only slight alterations are needed to make the results hold for any @xmath32 .    for example , a @xmath33-checkerboard matrix @xmath34 would be of the form @xmath35      let @xmath36 be the empirical spectral measure of a @xmath0 matrix @xmath34 , where we have normalized the eigenvalues by dividing by @xmath6 : @xmath37 where the @xmath38 are the eigenvalues of @xmath34 . here",

    "wigner s semicircle law states that for many random matrix ensembles , for almost all sequences @xmath40 of @xmath18 matrices @xmath41 , we have weak convergence of empirical spectral measures @xmath42 as @xmath2 to the semicircle measure of radius @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which has density @xmath45    note that for @xmath46 the ` semicircle ' distribution is actually a semi - ellipse with horizontal axis @xmath43 .",
    "while one can renormalize the eigenvalues by a constant independent of @xmath39 to rescale to a semicircle , we will see below that in our setting that constant would depend on @xmath1 .",

    "in fact , by using a matrix perturbation approach we are able to establish the following result , which we prove in appendix [ app_tworegimes ] :    let @xmath48 be a sequence of @xmath19-checkerboard matrixs . then almost surely as @xmath49 the eigenvalues of @xmath41 fall into two regimes : @xmath47 of the eigenvalues are @xmath50 and @xmath1 eigenvalues are of magnitude @xmath51 .",

    "the blip is where the vast majority of interesting behavior and technical challenges are encountered .",
    "we begin with some heuristic arguments which give intuition for how the blip arises and behaves .",
    "firstly , recall that a matrix @xmath34 for which the sum of all entries in any given row is equal to some fixed @xmath5 has the trivial eigenvalue @xmath5 with eigenvector @xmath61 . for a matrix in the @xmath18 @xmath1-checkerboard ensemble ,",
    "the sum of the @xmath8^th^ row is equal to @xmath62 where the @xmath63 are i.i.d . with mean @xmath13 and variance @xmath64 .",
    "this is approximately @xmath3 , so heuristically there should be an eigenvector very close to @xmath61 with eigenvalue roughly @xmath3 . similarly , there are @xmath65 other eigenvalues of size approximately @xmath3 with eigenvectors close to the one described previously with some additional periodic sign changes .",
    "hence the blip may be thought of as deviations about the trivial eigenvalues .",
    "the surprising result of this paper is that these deviations , while seemingly quite different from the eigenvalue distributions of classical random matrix theory , in fact have the same distribution as the eigenvalues of the following @xmath4 random matrix sub - ensemble of the classical gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",

    "it is almost a probability measure , i.e. for a typical matrix @xmath88 is close to @xmath64 . to make @xmath89 a probability measure we would need to divide by the sum of the weights associated to the eigenvalues , but the expected value of this quotient is intractable , so we instead divide by @xmath1 .    definition [ def_empirical_blip_measure ] finally allows reduction to tractable combinatorics .",
    "interestingly , this combinatorics reduces back to random matrix theory , yielding convergence in expectation of the moments of the weighted blip spectral measure of the @xmath1-checkerboard matrix ensemble to those of the @xmath4 hollow goe .",
    "however , we can not show almost - sure weak convergence of measures by standard arguments because ( a ) due to the weighting function , the blip empirical spectral measure is no longer a probability measure , and ( b ) the number of eigenvalues in the blip is fixed so there are not enough to average over .",

    "<S> we introduce a new family of @xmath0 random real symmetric matrix ensembles , the @xmath1-checkerboard matrices , whose limiting spectral measure has two components which can be determined explicitly . all but @xmath1 eigenvalues are in the bulk , and their behavior , appropriately normalized , converges to the semi - circle as @xmath2 ; the remaining @xmath1 are tightly constrained near @xmath3 and their distribution converges to the @xmath4 hollow goe ensemble ( this is the density arising by modifying the goe ensemble by forcing all entries on the main diagonal to be zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar results hold for complex and quaternionic analogues . </S>",
    "<S> we isolate the two regimes by using matrix perturbation results and a nonstandard weight function for the eigenvalues , then derive their limiting distributions using a modification of the method of moments and analysis of the resulting combinatorics . </S>"
