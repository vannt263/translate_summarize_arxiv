    "since the 1980s rydberg atoms , in which the valence electron is in a state of high principal quantum number @xmath1 , have been extensively studied . they have exaggerated atomic properties including dipole - dipole interactions that scale as @xmath2 and radiative lifetimes proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "another important property of the rydberg states is the large orbital radius , and hence dipole moment @xmath4 .",
    "the natural consequence of the large dipole moment featured by the rydberg atoms is the large interaction between two of them - one is able to observe dipole - dipole interactions between atoms on the @xmath5 scale .",
    "another consequence of the incredibly large dipole moment is an exaggerated response to external fields @xcite . due to a small admixing of the rydberg state with the ground one , the atoms experience long - range and large interactions while keeping a long lifetime in a quantum superposition , which is very useful for creating qubits , so rydberg atoms are well suited to applications in quantum information processing",
    "the idea of using dipolar rydberg interactions to implement the rydberg blockade bases on the fact that in an ensemble of atoms with long - range dipolar interactions between them , only one atom can be excited at given time .",
    "this dipole blockade has now been observed for two single atoms positioned at macroscopic distances @xcite .",
    "rydberg interaction between distanced atoms is used to implement one or two - qubit quantum gates of high fidelity @xcite .",
    "coupling of rydberg states results in d.c .",
    "kerr effect which is six order of magnitude greater then in conventional kerr .",
    "this result has great impact on development of high - precision electric field sensors and other nonlinear optical devices @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms are also applied in single - microwave - photon counters what is especially promising in high precession measurements in quantum optics @xcite . on this wide background of potential applications established in quantum optics and",
    "atomic physics demonstration of gigant rydberg excitons in cooper oxide ( @xcite , @xcite ) is a great step toward studies that are out of the reach in atomic physics , f.e .",
    "rydberg excitons , due to their smaller energies , need lower magnetic field to mimick hydrogen atoms in white - draft stars @xcite or they are promising candidate for creating bose - einstein condensat in solid  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of excitons and its consequences on the optical spectra of semiconductors , intensively studied over the decades , obtained a new impulse when the so - called rydberg excitons have been detected in a natural crystal of copper oxide found at the tsumeb mine in namibia @xcite , @xcite . in the simplest picture",
    "the exciton ( we have in mind the so - called wannier exciton ) is modelled as a hydrogen - like atom , composed from the electron and the hole , interacting via the coulomb potential screened by the semiconductor dielectric constant .",
    "the materials , where wannier excitons occur , show optical spectra where the transition states , related to the principal quantum number @xmath6 , are observed . in most previously studied materials , like , for example , gaas , only few excited excitonic states ( @xmath7 ) were detected , which was caused by the small excitonic binding energy ( in the order of a few mev , as in gaas ) , and dissipative processes . therefore the discovery reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the analysis of the spectra revealed spectral absorption lines associated with the formation of excitons that have principal quantum numbers as large as n = 25 , provoke a new situation in the condensed matter optics .",
    "many problems as , for example , the light - matter interaction when the excitons with such large quantum numbers are present , will expect new description .",
    "excitonic spectra of highly excited rydberg excitons observed recently resemble that of a hydrogen atom consisting of a rydberg series but even if the hydrogen picture of the exciton seems to be very simple , then , the calculations with eigenfunctions related to @xmath8 would be not trivial .",
    "the standard description needs to be revised do to the fact that a size of the exciton is much larger then the wavelenght of light used to create it @xcite .",
    "there are many factors , as , for example , the band structure , the temperature , the laser power , the dissipative processes , which should be included in the theoretical description .    here",
    "we neither enter into the analysis of the experiment nor in the calculations of the band structure .",
    "we propose a method , which gives a simple expression for the optical functions , taking into account excitonic states of arbitrary order which allows one to obtain theoretical spectra and to analyze the experimental ones .",
    "the method is based on the real density matrix approach and uses green s function method to solve the schrdinger - like equations which are typical for this approach .",
    "the method will also give insight into the aspect of polaritons , which are closely related to the excitonic states .",
    "the rdma , initiated by the works by stahl _",
    "et al_. see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , was very succsessful in describing optical properties of semiconductors for energies near the fundamental gap , where the excitons are relevant .",
    "this approach also solved the old abc problem ( for example , @xcite-@xcite ) , at least for the cases with a few excitonic states @xcite . in what follows",
    "we focuss the attention on the optical spectra of cu@xmath0o .",
    "as it follows by the analysis of crystal symmetry , the lines related to odd angular momentum exciton number @xmath9 are observed @xcite .",
    "the dominant role play the @xmath10-excitons ( the so - called yellow series ) , but also excitonic states with higher than @xmath11 angular momentum ( for example , the @xmath12- excitons with @xmath13 and @xmath14- excitons with @xmath15 ) were observed in one - photon absorption spectra of high - quality cuprous oxide .",
    "our method gives not only the energy eigenvalues , but also the line shapes of the optical functions , from which we have chosen the susceptibility .",
    "the presented theory explains many peculiar characteristics of rydberg excitons such as deviations from @xmath16 law of oscillator strengths and @xmath17 law for the excitonic energies and gives the polariton dispersion relation .",
    "using anisotropic effective masses , we show the energy splitting of the @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 excitons .",
    "our numerical results are in agreement with measurements obtained recently in the outstanding experiments performed by kazimierczuk _",

    "it is believed that the observation of rydberg excitons allows one to open a new field in condensed matter spectroscopy . for highly excited rydberg excitons in cu@xmath0o",
    "the scale is of over 1@xmath5 m @xcite so the application of solid state huge - size excitons as all - optical switching , mesoscopic single - photon devices or their implementation to construction of quantum gates influences the development of new experimental technics .",
    "additionally , it is interesting to note that the excitonic approach toward the old idea of rydberg atoms is example how the development of one field inspires the others .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the section [ density.matrix ]",
    ", we briefly recall the basic equations of the rdma approach and derive expressions for the interband susceptibility .",
    "next , in section [ cu2osusceptibility ] , the derived expression is analyzed for the case of cu@xmath0o crystal . in section [ polariton.dispersion ] , the derived expression for the susceptibility",
    "is used to obtain the polariton dispersion relation of the considered cuprous oxide crystal . in section [ anisotropy ] we show the impact of the effective masses anisotropy on the calculated optical properties . in section [ green ] the method of calculating the susceptibility and the polariton dispersion in terms of an appropriate green s function is presented . in section [ results ]",
    "the results for the absorption spectra are presented and discussed .",
    "the comparison of obtained results with experimental data and a brief overview of optimizing procedure is included.we close with final remarks in section [ finalremarks ] .",

    "the second boundary is located at the plane @xmath20 .",
    "as indicated above , we use the rdma . in the linear case , the optical response is obtained by solving the so - called constitutive equations , supplemented by the maxwell equations for the wave propagating in the semiconductor crystal . considering a semiconductor with a nondegenerate conduction band and a @xmath21",
