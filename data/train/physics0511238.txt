    "resonance is one of the most interesting and intriguing phenomena in quantum scattering . with a resonance one",
    "usually associates an unstable state that only exists during a certain time .",
    "the original idea of interpreting resonances in quantum mechanics as complex poles of the scattering amplitude ( and hence , as those of the scattering matrix ) goes back to g.gamov ( 1928 ) . for",
    "radially symmetric potentials , the interpretation of two - body resonances as poles of the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix has been entirely elaborated in terms of the jost functions . beginning with e.c.titchmarsh ( 1946 )",
    "it was also realized that the s - matrix resonances may show up as poles of the analytic continuation of the green functions .",
    "another , somewhat distinct approach to resonances is known as the complex scaling ( or complex rotation ) method .",
    "the complex scaling makes it possible to rotate the continuous spectrum of the @xmath0-body hamiltonian in such a way that resonances in certain sectors of the complex energy plane turn into usual eigenvalues of the scaled hamiltonian . in physics literature the origins of such an approach",
    "are traced back at least to c.lovelace ( 1964 ) .",
    "a rigorous approval of the complex scaling method has been done by e.balslev and j.m.combes ( 1971 ) . a link between the s - matrix interpretation of resonances and its complex rotation counterpart",
    "was established by g.a.hagedorn ( 1979 ) who has proven that for a wide class of potentials the scaling resonances are also the scattering matrix resonances .",
    "if support of the interaction is compact , the resonances of a two - body system can be treated within the approach created by p.lax and r.phillips ( 1967 ) .",
    "an advantage of the lax - phillips approach is in the opportunity of giving an elegant operator interpretation of resonances .",
    "the resonances show up as the discrete spectrum of a dissipative operator which is the generator of the compressed evolution semigroup .",
    "for more details on the history of the subject and other approaches to resonances , as well as for a bibliography we refer to paper @xcite . here",
    "we only notice that , in contrast to the `` normal '' bound and scattering states , the resonant ones are still a mysterious object and many questions related to resonances remain unanswered . in particular , it is still unknown how to describe ( in an indisputable way ) the scattering of a particle on a resonant state of two other particles .",
    "to say the truth , there is a problem even with definition of resonance since resonances are _ not _ a unitary invariant of a self - adjoint ( hermitian ) operator .",
    "moreover , following to b.simon @xcite , one may conclude that no satisfactory definition can rely on a single hamiltonian and always an extra structure is necessary .",
    "say , an unperturbed dynamics ( in quantum scattering theory ) or geometric setup ( in acoustical or optical problems ) .",
    "resonances are always relative as the scattering matrix itself .    in our approach",
    "we follow the typical setup where the resonances arising due to an interaction @xmath1 are considered relative to the unperturbed dynamics described by the kinetic energy operator @xmath2 .",
    "the resolvent @xmath3 of the total hamiltonian @xmath4 is an analytic operator - valued function of @xmath5 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath6 of @xmath7 is a natural boundary for holomorphy domain of @xmath8 considered as an operator - valued function .",
    "however the kernel @xmath9 may admit analytic continuation through the continuous spectrum of @xmath7 . or",
    "the form @xmath10 may do this for any @xmath11 of a dense subset of the hilbert space @xmath12 . or",
    "the `` compressed '' resolvent @xmath13 admits such a continuation for @xmath14 the orthogonal projection onto a subspace of @xmath12 . in any of these cases one deals with the riemann surface of an analytical function .    in the simplest example with @xmath15 , the two - body kinetic energy operator in coordinate representation",
    ", we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 are three - dimensional vectors .",
    "clearly , @xmath18 as a function of the energy @xmath19 has a two - sheeted riemann surface which simply coincides with that of the function @xmath20 .    in this way",
    "one also arrives with the concept of the unphysical energy sheet(s ) .",
    "the copy of the complex energy plane where the resolvent @xmath8 is considered initially as an operator - valued function is called the physical sheet .",
    "the remainder of the riemann surface is assumed to consist of the unphysical sheets ( in general , an unphysical sheet may only be a small part of the complex plane ) .",
    "analytic function is uniquely defined by its values on an infinite set in @xmath21 having limiting point(s ) .",
    "thus , if one knows the resolvent ( @xmath22-matrix , @xmath23-matrix ) on the physical sheet then one may , in principle , to express it on unphysical sheets through its values in the physical sheet . in this case all the study of resonances would reduce to a work completely on the physical sheet .",
    "in @xcite we have found just such expressions .",
    "more precisely , we have derived explicit representations for the two- and three - body @xmath8 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 on unphysical energy sheets in terms of these quantities themselves only taken on the physical sheet . in particular , the representations obtained show which blocks of the scattering matrix are `` responsible '' for resonances on a certain unphysical sheet .",
    "in general , we assume that the interaction potential @xmath26 falls off in coordinate space not slower than exponentially .",
    "when studying resonances of a two  body system with such an interaction one can employ equally well both coordinate and momentum representations .",
    "however in the three - body case it is much easier for us to work in the momentum space ( for an explanation see @xcite , p. 149 ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we proceed in the same way in the two - body case .",
    "thus , for the two - body kinetic energy operator @xmath27 we set @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the reduced relative momentum . in case of a local potential we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the function @xmath32 is holomorphic in @xmath33 on the whole three - dimensional complex space @xmath34 .",
    "the transition operator ( t - matrix ) reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the resolvent of the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "the operator @xmath38 is the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath39 that is , @xmath40 taking into account that @xmath41 .",
    "clearly , all dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath19 is determined by the integral term on the r.h.s .",
    "part of that looks like a particular case of the cauchy type integral @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "cauchy integrals of the same form but for both @xmath43 and @xmath44 we will also have below in three - body equations of sec .",
    "3 .    let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , be the riemann surface of the function @xmath47 if @xmath0 is odd , @xmath45 is formed of two sheets of the complex plane .",
    "one of them , where @xmath48 coincides with the arithmetic square root @xmath49 , we denote by @xmath50 . the other one , where @xmath51 , is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath0 is even , the number of sheets of @xmath45 is infinite . in this case as the index @xmath53 of a sheet @xmath54 we take the branch number of the function @xmath55 picked up from the representation @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the following statement can be easily proven by applying the residue theorem ( if necessary , see @xcite for a proof ) .    *",
    "lemma 1*. _ for a holomorphic @xmath58 , @xmath59 , the function @xmath60 given by is holomorphic on @xmath61 and admits the analytic continuation onto @xmath45 as follows @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the unit sphere in @xmath64 centered at the origin .",
    "( position of the argument @xmath19 in the sheet @xmath50 on the r.h.s .",
    "part of is the same as that of the argument of @xmath65 on the sheet @xmath66 . ) _    now set @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are holomorphic .",
    "then by lemma 1 @xmath70 which means that the continuation of the free green function @xmath71 onto the unphysical sheet @xmath52 can be written in short form as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the operator forcing a ( holomorphic ) function @xmath75 to set onto the energy shell , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "taking into account , on the unphysical sheet @xmath52 the lippmann - schwinger equation turns into @xmath77 hence @xmath78 invert @xmath79 by using the fact that @xmath80 and , hence , @xmath81 : @xmath82 apply @xmath74 to both parts of and obtain @xmath83 , which means @xmath84 observe that @xmath85 is nothing but the scattering matrix @xmath86 since the kernel of @xmath86 reads @xmath87 hence @xmath88^{-1}{\\mathit{j}}t$ ] .",
    "now go back to and get @xmath89^{-1 } { \\mathit{j}}t$ ] , that is , @xmath90^{-1}\\,{\\mathit{j}}(z)t(z).\\ ] ] all entries on the r.h.s .",
    "part of are on the physical sheet .",
    "this is just the representation for the t - matrix on the unphysical sheet we looked for",
    ".    from one immediately derives representations for the continued resolvent,@xmath91^{-1}{\\mathit{j}}(i - vg),\\ ] ] and continued scattering matrix , @xmath92^{-1}\\,\\mathcal{e},\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the inversion , @xmath94 .",
    "hence , the resonances are nothing but zeros of the scattering matrix @xmath86 in the physical sheet . that is , the energy @xmath19 on the unphysical sheet @xmath52 is a resonance if and only if there is a non - zero vector @xmath95 of @xmath96 such that @xmath97 for the same @xmath19 on the physical sheet .",
    "the function @xmath98 is the breakup amplitude of the resonance state .",
    "this means that in coordinate space the corresponding `` gamov vector '' ( the resonance solution to the schrdinger equation ) has the following asymptotics @xmath99",
    "let @xmath2 be the three - body kinetic energy operator in the center - of - mass system . assume for simplicity that there are no three - body forces and thus the total interaction reads @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , are the corresponding two - body potentials having just the same properties as in the previous section .    the best way to proceed in the three - body case is to work with the faddeev components @xcite @xmath103 of the t - operator @xmath104 where , as usually , @xmath8 denotes the resolvent of the total hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the components @xmath105 satisfy the faddeev equations @xmath106 with @xmath107 and @xmath108 where @xmath109 denote the corresponding reduced jacobi momenta ( see @xcite for the precise definition we use ) and @xmath110 is the total momentum .",
    "assume that any of the two - body subsystems has only one bound state with the corresponding energy @xmath111 , @xmath102 .",
    "assume in addition that all of these three binding energies are different .",
    "it is easy to see that the thresholds @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and 0 are associated with particular cauchy type integrals in the integral equations . by lemma 1",
    "the two - body thresholds @xmath115 appear to be square - root branching points while the three - body threshold 0 is the logarithmic one . in order to enumerate the unphysical sheets we introduce the multi - index @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 if @xmath102 .",
    "clearly , only encircling the two - body thresholds one arrives at seven unphysical sheets .",
    "the three - body threshold generates infinitely many unphysical sheets .",
    "( there might also be additional branching points on the unphysical sheets , in particular due to two - body resonances . )",
    "it turns out that the analytically continued equations can be explicitly  ( ! ) solved in terms of the matrix @xmath119 itself taken only on the physical sheet , just like in the case of the two - body t - matrix .",
    "but , of course , now the result depends on the unphysical sheet @xmath66 concerned .",
    "more precisely , the resulting representation reads as follows @xmath120 in the particular case we deal with , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are @xmath123 scalar matrices of the form @xmath124 @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively ; @xmath127 is a truncation of the total scattering matrix @xmath25 and the entries @xmath128 , @xmath129 are explicitly written in terms of the half - on - shell kernels of @xmath130 ( see formula ( 7.34 ) of @xcite ) . from one also derives explicit representations for @xmath131 and @xmath132 similar to those of and , respectively .    thus , to find resonances on the sheet @xmath66 one should simply look for the zeros of the truncated scattering matrix @xmath133 , that is , for the points @xmath19 in the physical sheet where equation @xmath134 has a non - trivial solution @xmath95 .",
    "the vector @xmath95 will consist of breakup amplitudes of the resonance state into the various possible channels .",
    "within such an approach one can also find the virtual states .    in order to find the amplitudes involved in @xmath135",
    ", one may employ any suitable method , for example the one of refs .",
    "@xcite based on the faddeev differential equations . in these works the approach we discuss has been successfully applied to several three - body systems . in particular , the mechanism of emerging the efimov states in the @xmath136he trimer has been studied @xcite ."
