    "such galaxies will still be potential members of a cluster centered at the origin .",
    "a more narrowly peaked distribution indicates a smaller fraction of galaxies available for inclusion via projection during cluster finding . as can be seen , the fraction of galaxies remaining within the red sequence cut at large distances from the origin increases with redshift ; the red sequence selects a longer path along line of sight at higher redshift .",
    "the other source of contamination is galaxies that are shifted into the red sequence by the change in observed color .",

    "this number is relatively small .",
    "our use of a uniform color change with redshift for all galaxies is not strictly correct for all galaxy types .",
    "however , blue star forming galaxies change in observed color much more slowly with redshift than in this model , so to be shifted erroneously into our red sequence color cut , these galaxies are required to be at significantly higher redshift than the cluster . since they would then lie outside of our 500 @xmath41 mpc box , they are not included in our analysis .",
    "the strongest contribution to interloper candidates is from galaxies which have colors within our red sequence color cut even though they are far from the central galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "our algorithm defines clusters as circular regions , centered on a bright galaxy , with red - sequence sky surface density equal to a multiple @xmath42 of the mean value at the redshift of interest .",
    "this approach is analogous to the spherical overdensity method used to define the halo masses . for target centers ,",
    "we work in descending order through a list of red - sequence galaxies ranked ( brightest to dimmest ) by apparent @xmath7-band magnitude . this ranking is motivated by a desire to find the rare , high mass halos first , then work down the mass function to more common objects .    around a potential cluster center ,",
    "a radially - sorted list of red sequence neighbors is used to define a mean galaxy number density profile as a function of transverse separation .",

    "the volume extends @xmath43mpc in front and behind , and galaxy colors are adjusted , linearly with distance in the projected direction , as described above .",
    "starting with the 8 nearest neighbors , ( to avoid shot noise problems in tracing the cluster profiles at small radii ) , we work outward in radius @xmath44 until the the number of galaxies @xmath45 fails to satisfy the overdensity criterion @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the mean sky surface density of red sequence galaxies in the ms , including the effects of the applied observed color evolution along the projected dimension .",
    "if the overdensity criterion is not satisfied for 8 galaxies , the object is discarded , if @xmath45 meets or exceeds a minimum of 8 galaxies , then this cluster is added to the output list .",

    "the approximate change of radius with richness can be read off from eq.[eqn : codefn ] .",

    "we make three projections of the simulated volume along its principal axes .    the choice of @xmath42 is discussed below .",
    "the sensitivity of survey purity and completeness to the choice of @xmath42 is further explored in the appendix .",
    "the clusters found by the search algorithm can be linked back to the dark matter halos in the simulation using their respective lists of galaxy members .",

    "in addition , the halo and cluster richnesses would agree .",
    "a perfect algorithm would therefore recover the intrinsic distribution of halo mass @xmath26 as a function of red sequence galaxy richness @xmath45 .",

    "our cluster richness estimator , @xmath64 , does not include such a correction ; our overdensity requirement means that approximately @xmath65 of the galaxies are from the background .    for each cluster identified in projection , we list all halos contributing one or more of its member galaxies .",
    "the quality of the cluster detection is measured by the top - ranked matched fraction , @xmath66 , defined as the fraction of cluster members coming from the halo that contributes the plurality of the cluster s red sequence galaxies .",

    "we consider these issues , both in the context of setting our circular overdensity threshold and in the results obtained .",
    "we will see that high levels of purity and completeness are achieved , and that the cluster samples are nearly unbiased .",
    "( many definitions of purity and completeness exist in the literature , we describe and compare several of them in the appendix , and detail our definitions as we use them below . )",

    "more halos are missed at higher redshift , and these tend to have extended , filamentary shapes suggestive of recent ( or imminent ) merging . at higher redshift , the major merger rate increases , leading to a higher fraction of disturbed halos .    keeping the cluster richness fixed at @xmath69 in order to define whether a halo is found or not ( completeness )",

    "there are several effects which cause an increasing incidence of blends at higher redshift .",
    "firstly , the change of observed color with distance is weaker , and secondly , the red sequence is wider , so the color - magnitude cut selects galaxies from a thicker slice along the line of sight .",
    "these seem to be the strongest causes and were illustrated in fig.[fig : colorchange ] .",
    "another way of seeing the effect of color / magnitude evolution is to remove it entirely at @xmath24 ; the background level then increases and the contrast between the clusters and the background declines . lowering @xmath42 to obtain the same number of clean clusters at the fixed mass range of fig .",
    "[ fig : mlike ] , we find that the level of blends increases to @xmath98 , very close to what is seen at @xmath99 . similarly , to increase the clean fraction , one can impose the @xmath24 color evolution on the @xmath75 population . in this case , however , the number of non - red sequence galaxies brought into the red sequence through our evolution increases strongly , limiting the degree to which blends can be reduced .",
    "a third contributing factor is that , at earlier times , the mass function is steeper , causing the number of possible interloper halos per target halo ( of mass @xmath100 , for example ) to grow at high redshift .",
    "the increase in intermediate - mass halos is also enhanced because the central galaxy magnitude is less well correlated with host halo mass at @xmath88 than at low redshift . over time",
    ", central galaxies in massive halos grow and brighten via mergers , leading to a stronger correlation between @xmath7magnitude and halo mass . our cluster finding algorithm works in descending order of luminosity .",
    "at low redshift , the luminosity sorting corresponds well to a sorting in halo mass but , at high redshift , more low mass systems are mixed into the range of central galaxy magnitude occupied by high mass halos",
    ".    as these factors are fairly generic , as expected , the trend toward more blends at @xmath88 appeared in all the cases we considered : changing definition and tightness of the red sequence , changing @xmath64 cuts and changing the spherical overdensity requirement . for a wide range of density cuts and modeling choices the blends have roughly half the mass of the clean matches at @xmath24 , and this mass scale declines at higher redshift .",
    "since blended clusters are associated with lower mass halos , they will be evident in follow - up studies as such .",
    "their mean lensing signal , x  ray luminosity and temperature , and thermal sz decrement should be low relative to clean systems .",
    "spectroscopic signatures of substructure , in the form of multiple peaks or other departures from gaussianity , would also be likely in these systems .",

    "we assume a power - law relation of the form @xmath104 @xcite , and quote values normalized , arbitrarily , to the luminosity of a @xmath105 halo at each epoch . we also assume scatter in the mass  luminosity relation , @xmath106 , and",
    "combine this with the dispersion in mass for the chosen richness range ( fig.[fig : mlike ] ) to give the dispersion in luminosity , @xmath102 .",
    "lower values have been suggested for @xmath107 @xcite , but the scatter in mass at fixed @xmath45 dominates the intrinsic l - m scatter anyway .",
    "the clean clusters have mean x - ray luminosities that tend to be slightly higher than the corresponding values for halos of the same richness .",
    "the blended systems are substantially dimmer , by a factor two in the mean at @xmath24 , growing to a factor three at @xmath75 .",
    "blends should be a generic outcome of red sequence - based cluster finding methods , and there are indications of this from initial x - ray and dynamical observations of the rcs clusters . in chandra observations of 13 clusters at @xmath108 ,",
    "@xcite confirm 12 as x - ray sources at 3@xmath109 significance , suggesting that @xmath110 of the cluster candidates are massive structures with deep gravitational potential wells ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , their x - ray luminosities were systematically lower at a given cluster richness than seen for lower - redshift x - ray selected clusters .",
    "most of the clusters lay on a sequence only slightly offset from the expected @xmath111-richness relation , but several clusters were significantly offset .",
    "optical spectroscopy of one of these clusters ( at @xmath112 ) showed that it consisted of several structures which are dynamically discrete but whose red sequences were overlapping in the survey data @xcite precisely the sort of blended system expected by the study here ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for large scatter between x - ray luminosity and optical richness has been seen in e.g. @xcite .    instead of using only the top - ranked halo mass to determine the x - ray signal , we can instead sum the luminosity of all contributing halos . in this case , all the cluster luminosities go up , with the clean subset increasing by roughly @xmath113 and the blended subset increasing by a larger amount",
    ". then the ratio of clean to blended mean luminosities changes to @xmath114 at low redshift and to @xmath115 at high redshift .",
    "the luminosity measured by x ",
    "ray observation will depend on details of the projected spatial arrangement , the noise characteristics and other details that lie beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "it seems reasonable to consider the values quoted for the single halo case as a lower bound , and the values from summing all halos as an upper bound , on what would be observed .",
    "another difference between clean and blended systems is in their radial cluster profiles .",
    "stacked profiles of the clean and blended clusters are used to produce the density profiles , @xmath116 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] .",
    "the clean clusters have a significantly steeper mean density profile than the blends .",
    "this result suggests that a matched angular filter approach @xcite could offer improvements , particularly one that includes radial distance information from photometric redshifts or colors @xcite .",
    "observations of colors with distance to cluster center ( e.g.  @xcite ) and other properties ( e.g.  @xcite ) are already in place at high redshifts .",
    "going further down the luminosity function would provide more galaxies to trace out the profile , but at the risk of including more faint background galaxies redshifted into the color region .",
    "the interlopers in both clean and blended clusters , as expected by @xcite , lie ( slightly ) more frequently in the background than the foreground .",
    "there does nt seem to be a strong trend in the moment of inertia for clean versus blended clusters ; often the blends are projections , rather than objects which are merely unrelaxed .",
    "we also considered using @xmath117 color at high redshift , rather than @xmath18 , and found a similar blend fraction , even though the red sequence turns out to be narrower .",
    "this is because the evolution of red sequence galaxies ( now defined with respect to @xmath117 ) remains very slow with redshift , thus , as with @xmath18 color at high redshift , many of the galaxies do not evolve out of the red sequence even when far from the cluster center .",
    "similarly , the number of non - red sequence galaxies evolving into the selection window remains small across the @xmath118 projected length .",
    "as mentioned earlier , blends can be immediately reduced by increasing the spherical overdensity criterion @xmath42 , but only at the cost of losing true halos as well .",
    "an increase in @xmath42 also shifts the mass - richness relation to lower values of @xmath45 compared to the intrinsic case , and decreases the number of clusters found at fixed @xmath45 .",
    "these trends reflect the usual tradeoff between purity and completeness for cluster samples ; for more discussion see , e.g. , the appendix of @xcite and the appendix of this paper .",
    "in the above analysis , we have found properties and trends for blends as a function of redshift . some of these results depend on particular details of the millennium simulation and our method , and some are likely to be general .",
    "most of the increase in blends at @xmath119 comes from the slower change of color with increasing redshift .",
    "this color change was not obtained directly from the millennium simulation but from a simple stellar population synthesis model that reproduces observations .",
    "we expect this result to be general .",
    "our implementation of the color change with redshift is crude but the candidate high redshift interlopers are mostly red sequence galaxies , where our approximation is best expected to hold . as a result , we do not expect more detailed color implementations , such as mock light cones ( e.g.   @xcite for the ms ) , to produce substantially different local ( @xmath120 ) projected contamination .",
    "the increased width of the red sequence at high redshift is derived from the millennium simulation . however , at @xmath88 , the weak color evolution combined with the deep `` green valley '' separating the red and blue populations in the ms means that our results are reasonably insensitive to the precise width .",
    "most of the interloper galaxies are themselves members of the red sequence in their respective projected halos .",
    "the @xmath18 color shift for @xmath39 projection at @xmath75 is @xmath121 and @xmath122 , so only by compressing the red sequence to a width well below these values would one have an appreciable effect on the blended fraction .",
    "the relative numbers of interloper halos at different redshifts is a property of the underlying dark matter power spectrum and linear growth rate . for a fixed target mass , more interloper halos at higher redshift",
    "are expected generically .",
    "physically , if we look at the line - of - sight distribution of the contaminating material we find that the contaminating mass at large distances ( @xmath123mpc ) more than doubles between redshift @xmath34 and @xmath13 .",
    "this enhanced contamination from large distances is also true on a cluster - by - cluster basis : the fraction of clusters with more than e.g. 30% of their material coming from @xmath124 mpc grows significantly with redshift .",
    "this material is far outside the cluster virial radius and not just material which got `` caught '' by the cluster finder before it fell in to truly be part of the cluster .",
    "note that superclusters of very large size have been seen out at these redshifts , for example see recent studies of superclusters by @xcite .",
    "there are other possible interlopers as well .",
    "for instance , adding galaxies that lie outside the ms volume will only increase the amount of blended contamination . also , at faint magnitudes , the increasing numbers of background blue galaxies available to redshift into the red sequence are a potential cause for concern ; increasing numbers of blue galaxies at high redshift are observed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( it should be noted that there are observational techniques to take many of them out which we do not include here ) .",
    "we saw only a small fraction of candidate interlopers from galaxies outside the red sequence , except at low redshift , where the green valley is highly compressed ( see fig.[fig : colorchange ] ) .",
    "this is good , as the observed color and magnitude evolution of these galaxies was approximated to be the same as for red sequence galaxies ; we expect the interloper numbers due to these objects is minimized at high redshift because of their small contribution in our approximation .",
    "in fact , taking out the observed color and magnitude evolution of the non - red - sequence galaxies entirely ( and adjusting @xmath42 to get the same value of @xmath125 ) gives similar clean fractions as in our fiducial model .    to extend our analysis of the ms ( tuning the cluster finder to cluster color profiles in more detail , for example ) requires further developments .",
    "the ms utilizes sophisticated physical models for properties such as star formation histories , initial mass function and stellar population synthesis models , dust production and radiative transfer models , and the sensitivity of all of these to local conditions .",
    "the resulting ms catalogues match observations of large numbers of properties ( e.g. @xcite ) at many redshifts . a detailed , multi - color comparison to observed galaxy number counts",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "some departures from observations are noted there , in particular the over - prediction of the abundance of moderately massive galaxies at high redshifts , notably @xmath126 .    for our cluster finding , the only properties used are the galaxy locations and their fluxes in two filters .",
    "tuning the cluster finder to more specific properties of these fluxes ( for example , their radial trends within clusters ) in the ms will require higher fidelity galaxy formation models .",
    "work is in progress to improve the model s match to observations .",
    "for example , known issues in the ms under study include , for @xmath127 clusters , a faint red satellite excess and an excess tail of bright blue objects ( but with overall blue satellite fractions too low ) , and no `` green valley''@xcite .",
    "we find a red sequence with the wrong sign for the color - magitude slope ( the brightest galaxies tend to be slightly bluer than the fainter , see fig .  [",
    "fig : redseq ] ) , and similarly the blue fraction increases towards brighter luminosity and has the wrong radial evolution within clusters for our three redshifts .",
    "in addition the simulation was run with the earlier wmap parameters rather than the wmap3 @xcite current best fit cosmology .",
    "future improvements in optical cluster finding will require simulated catalogues that are in better quantitative agreement with the growing body of deep galaxy surveys . to refine and use more sophisticated color finders",
    "does not necessarily require all the physics employed in the ms , which aims to explain a multitude of observational properties rather than simply reproduce them .",
    "purely statistical mock catalogues can be built on halo model fits tuned empirically to data in the redshift range of interest .",
    "the catalogues can focus narrowly on observational properties relevant to the search algorithm .",
    "in particular , critical to a quantitative prediction of the amount of contamination in color - selected surveys are accurate colors for galaxies in groups and filaments in the outskirts of clusters , as red - sequence galaxies in these regions are the most likely source of interlopers",
    ".    such survey - specific catalogues are crucial to understand selection functions , in part because they allowing search algorithms to be tuned to the cluster `` color footprint '' and spatial profile .",
    "this approach has already been profitably used at low redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at high redshift ,",
    "data sets large enough to tune such catalogues are just coming into being ; combined with modeling improvements in recent years the construction of such catalogues is now a feasible task",
    ".    however , without such a catalogue in hand , our primary effect is still simple to illustrate .",
    "this effect is that the spatial cut provided by the observed color and magnitude cut widens as redshift increases .",
    "conversely a narrow spatial cut reduces the blends strongly .",
    "for example , taking an exact spatial cut for the ms , boxes @xmath128mpc wide at all three redshifts , the clean fraction becomes almost 100% at low redshift and 95% at high redshift .",
    "( presumably the remaining blends are due to the other contributing factors mentioned above . ) a slice this thick would corresponds to a fine redshift selection , @xmath129 at redshift 0.99 ( 0.41 ) .",
    "this level of accuracy is potentially attainable with next - generation photometric redshifts .",
    "with the advent of wide field imagers , optical searches have become a powerful way to compile large samples of high redshift clusters .",
    "key to these techniques is the use of multi - color information to reduce the line - of - sight contamination that plagued earlier , single filter , observations @xcite .",
    "two - filter information provides only limited redshift filtering , and this paper begins to explore the questions of what types of objects are selected by such techniques , and how this selection evolves with redshift .",
    "we use a simple circular overdensity search algorithm on local sky projections of the galaxy population of the millennium simulation , tuned using knowledge of the red sequence present in simulated halos with eight or more galaxies brighter than @xmath130 in the @xmath7-band .",
    "the free parameter , the density contrast @xmath42 , is tuned to maximize both purity and completeness , and the choice @xmath68 produces a number of clusters as a function of galaxy richness that is close to the underlying richness function of halos .",
    "we find that essentially all clusters have some degree of projected contamination ; a cluster of optical richness @xmath45 typically has red sequence members from @xmath131 halos along the line - of - sight . in the large majority of cases ,",
    "the contamination is not dominant , and most of a cluster s members are associated with a single , massive halo .",
    "a minority are highly blended cases in which projected contamination is dominant , and no single halo contributes a majority of the cluster s members .",
    "we find an increased fraction of blends with redshift .",
    "although several factors contribute , the most important factor appears to be weaker evolution in the observed color of red sequence galaxies with increasing redshift .",
    "this effectively increases the path length searched by the red sequence color cut , leading to a larger cross section for accidental , line - of - sight projections .",
    "in addition , at higher redshift , the number of @xmath132 halos relative to a @xmath105 halo is larger , and the central galaxy red magnitudes at these mass scales are more similar .",
    "the blends add a low - mass tail to the halo mass selection function for clusters of fixed optical richness .",
    "for our found clusters with optical richness targeting @xmath133 halos , we expect that @xmath134 of these systems would be underluminous in x ",
    "rays by a factor of two at @xmath24 , growing to @xmath98 underluminous by a factor closer to three at @xmath75 .",
    "the scatter in individual x  ray luminosities for the complete set of clusters is expected to be large , @xmath135 at high redshift , and there is considerable overlap in the distributions of @xmath136 expected for clean and blended clusters .",
    "it should be noted that , observationally , high redshift low - luminosity systems are also likely have lower signal to noise .",
    "the galaxy number density profiles are slightly shallower for blends than for clean clusters , and a matched spatial filter approach may help identify and eliminate the former .",
    "since some fraction of halos , those undergoing mergers especially , will also be spatially extended , careful study of the effect of spatial filtering on halo completeness is needed .",
    "alternatively , instead of decreasing the number of blends in searches , our findings here suggest modeling the mass likelihood @xmath8 as a bimodal log - normal distribution , with the fraction of blends , and the location and width of that component , included as nuisance parameters .",
    "this expected bimodal distribution can be incorporated into error estimates for cluster number counts as a function of redshift , for instance , along with other expected errors ( such as the 5 - 10% scatter associated with red sequence associated redshifts @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the detailed color / magnitude trends within galaxy clusters is key to refining red sequence cluster finding and improving its success rate .",
    "fortunately , data sets in hand or on the way , combined with rapidly improving modeling methods , will lead to improvements in our understanding of high redshift colors and their evolution .",
    "this work will be driven largely by survey - specific mocks current examples are the 2mass @xcite , the deep2 survey@xcite , the 2dfgrs @xcite and the sdss @xcite  and such efforts will be necessary for mining the rich science provided by existing and future high redshift cluster surveys .",

    "purity and completeness are `` success rates '' used when one wants a catalogue of a certain type of object and has obtained , via some method , a catalogue of candidates .",
    "a classic definition starts with the number of objects which are both in the candidate set and in the desired target set , i.e.  the intersection of these sets . dividing the number in the intersection by the total number of target objects then gives completeness , and dividing by the total number of candidate objects gives purity ( or reliability ) .",
    "these definitions go back many years in radio astronomy .",
    "for instance @xcite used these definitions to describe how well optical sources were matched to radio sources as a function of search aperture radius . in our case ,",
    "target objects are halos , defined in terms of true richness or mass , and candidate objects are clusters , defined in terms of observed richness .    while these terms have a long history , it is not clear that such definitions are the ` single number ' one wants to characterize the success of a cluster finding algorithm .",
    "if the properties of the sample change slowly with e.g.  richness or mass for example , we may not wish to impose a hard threshold on richness when computing purity .",
    "finding a cluster with 19 members may be just as good as requiring 20 .",
    "we shall consider several generalizations of the classic notions of purity and completeness below .",
    "we note that there are several choices in all of these definitions : the two catalogues , including their underlying data samples and the search algorithms employed , and the definition of which clusters lie in the intersection .",
    "even focussing on the circular overdensity method , as we do here , there is considerable latitude in defining both the target catalogue ( e.g. , specific definition of a halo , use of halo richness or mass as the order parameter ) and the cluster candidate sample ( minimum observed cluster richness , choice of @xmath42 ) .",
    "we consider here how purity and completeness vary with @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig : true_pur_lit ] shows the classic definitions of purity and completeness applied to our catalogues for target halos with true richness @xmath137 and candidate clusters with observed richness @xmath138 .",
    "we define a cluster and its halo to be in the overlap of the two catalogues if the halo in the target set contributes the most galaxies to a cluster in the candidate set .",
    "a more restrictive definition is to require the halo to contribute more than half of the galaxies in a given cluster ( @xmath139 ) . in both cases ,",
    "one divides the overlap number by the total number of target halos ( completeness ) and total number of candidate clusters ( purity ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : true_pur_lit ] , these two cases ( all @xmath66 and @xmath94 ) for the overlap set are shown as smooth and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "we show fig .",
    "[ fig : true_pur_lit ] as a function of _ decreasing _ overdensity threshold , @xmath42 , because this mimics a search region of increasing radial scale . at high",
    "@xmath42 , purity is maximized because the cluster sample is selecting the dense cores of the most massive halos . as the threshold is decreased , the enlarged search area and lower intrinsic density within the halo increases the frequency of best matched halos which are below the target richness threshold , lowering the cluster sample purity .",
    "in contrast , the completeness grows with lower @xmath42 , as the increasing search scale matches and then exceeds the radial scale used to define the halo population . the number of observed clusters at fixed richness increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath42 , improving the odds of completely matching to the massive halo sample .",
    "the purity and completeness curves cross at roughly our chosen threshold , @xmath140 .",
    "these measures of purity and completeness are substantially lower than unity because , as shown in fig.[fig : truefound ] , there is substantial scatter between @xmath141 and @xmath142 for matched halo - cluster pairs .",
    "this should not be taken as a failure of the algorithm , because the source of impurity and incompleteness ",
    "the scatter  is largely understood .",
    "there are a number of ways to take this scatter into account , and the optimal method depends strongly on the intended use of the catalogue .",
    "different target / candidate sets will vary in purity and completeness , driven by the form of the scatter . to characterize this one",
    "could , for example , use @xmath143 , @xmath144 to calculate completeness , and @xmath145 , @xmath146 to calculate purity .",
    "if one approximates the scatter as poisson an obvious choice for @xmath147 would be @xmath148 . for @xmath149 using @xmath150 raises the fractions for completeness and purity by @xmath151 ( the largest change is at @xmath42 for low completeness or purity , the smallest at high completeness or purity ) , while using @xmath152 roughly doubles the effect . the purity and completeness curves still cross around @xmath140 ( slightly lower for @xmath24 ) but at a higher fraction ( for @xmath24 it goes from @xmath153 to @xmath154 to @xmath155 for shifts by 5 and 10 , respectively ) .",
    "note that the _ a priori _ arbitrary choice of @xmath156 should be motivated by some understanding of how the sample properties change with the property being used to define the sample .    extending the candidate sample",
    "when defining completeness and the target sample when defining purity can be taken further .",
    "we can take the target halo @xmath141 above some cut and consider _ all _ clusters above the minimum richness threshold ( which could be as low as one ) to define completeness , for example .",
    "in our case the minimum richness threshold is @xmath69 .",
    "the differential form of completeness for @xmath157 and @xmath158 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffound ] in the main text . for",
    "purity one can again reverse the limits .",
    "if one goes to @xmath159 , all clusters will get matched to at least one halo , and values close to this will have similar results . a possibly more useful definition of purity could be that the best matched halo contributes at least 0.5 of its partner cluster s members .",
    "this definition of purity corresponds to the clean fraction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlike ] .    fig .",
    "[ fig : true_pur ] shows the purity and completeness for these less restrictive sample definitions , taking @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",

    "fig : true_pur_lit ] . at high surface density @xmath42",
    ", the @xmath69 cluster sample is incomplete with respect to @xmath162 halos because the cores of some @xmath70 halos fall below the cluster richness limit of 8 members . as mentioned in the text , high redshift",
    "high mass halos are more likely to be disturbed than their lower redshift counterparts and thus to fall below the overdensity threshold .",
    "the purity of the overall cluster sample purity is very high at @xmath2 , but declines at higher redshift where halo blending is more severe .",
    "as the threshold @xmath42 is lowered , the fraction of halo galaxies lying above the projected threshold increases , but the potential for confusion by projection also increases . for @xmath163 ,",
    "the @xmath164 cluster sample is essentially 100% complete for @xmath70 halos at all redshifts .",
    "the overall purity of the @xmath165 cluster sample is substantially lower , dropping to values below 0.5 at @xmath5 .    another way of choosing the two samples is pursued by @xcite , who take fig .",
    "[ fig : truefound ] , combining both blends and clean clusters , and identify strong outliers ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "they take a slice in a fixed @xmath142 range to define purity ( number which are not outliers over total in slice ) and a slice in a fixed @xmath141 range to define completeness ( number which are not outliers over total in slice ) .",
    "the issue of how outliers are defined and which slices in @xmath142 , @xmath141 are taken will affect the detailed results , and , again , the intended use of the catalogue needs to be taken into account before deciding the optimal choices .    the difficulty in finding the best definition lies in trying to get two numbers ( purity and completeness ) to characterize an entire joint distribution . the full distribution of candidate properties as a function of target halo properties is the key information required to compute expectations for an observational catalogue",
    "the scatter is not a problem if its shape is sufficiently well understood and the required accuracy for understanding this distribution depends upon the specific use of the catalogue .",
    "for instance , high purity ( but not necessarily high completeness ) might be of interest if one is interested in high mass clusters for individual x - ray followup , while if one wants a sample of clusters for cosmological parameters , a scatter in mass can be included in the analysis , but high completeness is desirable to beat down statistics . if one can correct for scatter perfectly , obtaining high purity is then not crucial ; purity serves only to quantify the size of the correction being applied to the data or the model .",
    "the errors that are most important to avoid , and how well characterized our selection function is , determines the best line of attack in the tradeoff between purity and completeness .",

    "<S> we investigate halo mass selection properties of red - sequence cluster finders using galaxy populations of the millennium simulation ( ms ) . a clear red sequence exists for ms galaxies in massive halos at redshifts @xmath0 , and we use this knowledge to inform a cluster - finding algorithm applied to @xmath1 projections of the simulated volume . at low redshift ( @xmath2 ) , we find that @xmath3 of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single , real - space halo , and that @xmath4 are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a majority of a cluster s membership . at @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of blends increases to @xmath6 , as weaker redshift evolution in observed color extends the comoving length probed by a fixed range of color . </S>",
    "<S> other factors contributing to the increased blending at high-@xmath7 include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a larger number of intermediate mass halos hosting bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass halos . </S>",
    "<S> our method produces catalogs of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function , @xmath8 , is characterized by a bimodal log - normal model with a dominant component that reproduces well the real - space distribution , and a redshift - dependent tail that is broader and displaced by a factor @xmath9 lower in mass . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications for x - ray properties of optically selected clusters and offer ideas for improving both mock catalogs and cluster - finding in future surveys .    </S>",
