    "phononic crystals present very rich wave physics characteristics resulting from the modulation of acoustic and stress waves through their periodic microstructure .",

    "the recent surge of research effort toward the study of wave propagation in phononic crystals has depended upon the speed , efficiency and versatility of phononic bandstructure calculating algorithms .",
    "several techniques can be used to calculate these bandstructures including the plane wave expansion ( pwe ) method @xcite , the multiple scattering method @xcite , the finite difference time domain method @xcite and the finite element method @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "pwe and variational methods are two of the most commonly used solvers owing to the ease of their implementation and their versatility .",
    "the salient feature of pwe is that it expresses material properties and the displacement field using fourier expansion .",
    "the expansion terms can be made to satisfy bloch - periodicity a - priori and pwe is algorithmically easy to implement .",
    "however , pwe converges slowly when material properties show large contrast with convergence properties similar to a simply displacement based variational scheme ( rayleigh quotient , see ref.@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we combine the salient aspects of pwe with a variational technique which is based upon varying both the displacement and the stress fields @xcite .",
    "the superior convergence of the mixed method over both pwe and rayleigh quotient has been theoretically proven in literature @xcite and also been demonstrated in a numerical study@xcite .",
    "previous implementation of the mixed variation formulation employed numerical integration to evaluate each matrix element in the eigenvalue problem . in this paper",
    "we show that by expressing the material properties and test functions using fourier expansion , we can mitigate the need for explicit numerical integration and achieve close form expressions for the eigenvalue matrices .",
    "the related matrices are required to be evaluated a limited number of times through the calculation of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , thus accelerating matrix assembly by eliminating the time consuming numerical integration process .",
    "we describe clearly how it can be applied to 1- , 2- , and 3-d unit cells of arbitrary complexity in their bravais structure and in the shape , size , number , and anisotropicity of their micro - constituents .",
    "we present 1- , 2- and 3-d test cases which verify the results of the formulation with published results in literature ( exact solution for 1-d , plane wave approximation for 2-d and fdtd solution for 3-d ) .",

    "if the bloch wave vector is @xmath24 then these boundary conditions are given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the components of the traction vector and @xmath27 is the exterior normal vector on @xmath23 .",
    "under the bloch boundary conditions the nature of elastic waves in periodic composites is expressed as an infinite set of eigenvalues which depend upon both frequency and wavenumber .",
    "this is the phononic dispersion relation of the composite and many numerical techniques have been devised to compute it .",
    "here we focus on combining the desirable properties of the pwe method and the mixed - variational method .",
    "the former is the method which is easiest to implement and the latter is the one which displays one of the highest convergence rates .",
    "the plane wave method uses the periodicity of the unit cell to expand the material properties in a fourier series involving the reciprocal lattice vectors : @xmath28 where @xmath29 furthermore , it expands the displacement field in a bloch modified fourier series involving the reciprocal lattice vectors : @xmath30 clearly the above automatically satisfies the bloch periodicity conditions on the displacement field ( [ boundaryconditions ] ) . subsituting the above expansions into the equation of motion ( [ equationofmotion ] ) directly results in an eigenvalue problem",

    "their sizes depend upon whether the problem under consideration is 1- , 2- , or 3-dimensional .",
    "these matrices would be described more clearly in the subsequent sections in which numerical examples are shown .",
    "the above system of equations can be recast into the following traditional eigenvalue problem : @xmath59 whose eigenvalue solutions represent the frequencies ( @xmath60 ) associated with the wave - vector under consideration ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "the mixed method converges significantly faster than the plane wave method .",

    "we also note that these expressions make clear that the resolution with which the unit cell needs to be discretized for sampling the material properties is ultimately governed by the number of fourier terms used in the expansion of the field variables .",
