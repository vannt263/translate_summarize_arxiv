    "the ability to control light propagation in turbid media is of great importance to many fields , ranging from medical imaging , laser surgery to photovoltaics and energy - efficient ambient lighting @xcite .",
    "thanks to the recent developments of adaptive wavefront shaping and phase recording techniques in optics , the spatial degree of freedom of the input light can be controlled at an unprecedented level of precision .",
    "these developments have enabled coherent control of light propagation in highly scattering media by manipulating the interference of multiply scattered waves @xcite .",
    "one striking interference effect that has caught much attention is the existence of highly transmitting channels , termed `` open channels '' in a diffusive system .",
    "these open channels , which enable an optimally prepared coherent input beam to transmit through a strong scattering medium with order unity efficiency , were predicted initially for electrons @xcite .",
    "since it is much more difficult to control the input electron states than the input states of classical waves , the wavefront shaping technique has been utilized in the past few years to increase the coupling of the incident light to the open channels of random media @xcite .",
    "the open channels greatly enhance light penetration into the scattering media , that will have a profound impact in a wide range of applications .    in reality absorption exists in any material system , and could have a significant impact on light transport in both diffusion regime and localization regime @xcite . on one hand",
    "the interference effects may be modified by absorption , on the other hand light absorption in strong scattering media can be drastically enhanced or suppressed by interference effects @xcite .",
    "thus the interplay between absorption and interference determines not only the amount of energy being transmitted , but also the amount of energy being deposited in a random medium . for example , wavefront shaping has enabled focusing of laser light onto a localized absorber that is buried within a random medium to enhance the local absorption @xcite .",
    "absorption also has a strong effect on the transmission eigenchannels , especially the open channels .",
    "the transmission channels are eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the field transmission matrix of the system .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath3 are the transmittance of the corresponding eigenchannels . in the lossless diffusion regime ,",
    "the density of the eigenvalues @xmath3 has a bimodal distribution , with one peak at @xmath4 that corresponds to closed channels , and a peak at @xmath5 that corresponds to open channels @xcite .",
    "an open channel has a spatial profile extended throughout the entire random medium , with the intensity maximum near the center @xcite .",
    "when strong absorption is introduced uniformly across the entire system , the diffusive transport of light in the maximum transmission channel turns into quasi - ballistic @xcite .",
    "the straightening of optical paths through the random medium reduces the dwell time and minimize the attenuation by absorption .",
    "the statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues are no longer bimodal , as the peak at @xmath5 is diminished by strong absorption @xcite .",
    "experimentally absorbers are often distributed non - uniformly in random samples , and it is not clear how the open channels would respond to spatially inhomogeneous absorption .    in this paper , we present a numerical study on the transmission eigenchannels in disordered waveguides with spatially localized absorbing regions .",
    "we calculate the statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues and find it can be broader than that with uniform absorption .",
    "the longer tail of the distribution is attributed to the higher transmission eigenchannels that manage to circumvent the local absorbing regions to minimize loss .",
    "compared to other transmission eigenchannels , the one with the largest eigenvalue is the most efficient in bypassing the absorbing regions to transport the maximal amount of energy through the random system .",
    "consequently , the ratio of the maximum transmittance to the average transmittance increases with absorption and eventually exceeds the ratio without absorption .",
    "in our simulation , we consider a 2d disordered waveguide , shown schematically in fig .",
    "1(a ) . the dielectric cylinders with refractive index @xmath6 = 2.0 and radius @xmath7 = 50 nm are randomly positioned inside a waveguide with perfectly reflecting sidewalls .",
    "the dielectric cylinders occupy an area fraction of 0.04 corresponding to an average distance between cylinders of @xmath8 = 0.44 @xmath9 m .",
    "the probe light enters the waveguide from the left open end and is scattered by the cylinders .",
    "the wavelength of input light @xmath10 is set to 510 nm , to avoid the mie resonances of individual dielectric cylinders .",
    "the light is transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarized , its electric field is parallel to the cylinder axis ( @xmath11-axis ) .",
    "the width of the waveguide is @xmath12 = 10.5 @xmath9 m ; the number of guided modes in the empty waveguide is @xmath13 .",
    "the length of the random array of cylinders is @xmath1420.6 @xmath9 m .    :",
    "homogeneous distribution of absorbers across the entire random arrays of cylinders .",

( c ) @xmath17 : absorbers are concentrated in a single circular region of diameter @xmath16 in the middle of the disordered waveguide . ]    we use the recursive green s function method @xcite to calculate the transmission matrix of the disordered waveguide @xcite , which gives the output field for any arbitrary input . using the input and output fields as the boundary conditions ,",
    "we further compute the field distribution inside the disordered waveguide .",
    "the field intensity is averaged over the waveguide cross - section to give the evolution @xmath18 along the waveguide ( in the @xmath19 direction ) .",
    "the ensemble - averaged @xmath20 displays a linear decay , from which we extract the transport mean free path @xmath21 1.65 @xmath9 m @xcite .",
    "the localization length is then estimated to be @xmath22107 @xmath9 m . since @xmath23 , the propagation of light in the disordered waveguide can be described by diffusion .    after characterizing the scattering properties , we introduce optical absorption to the disordered waveguide .",
    "below we consider three cases .",
    "the first one , labeled @xmath24 , has homogeneous absorption across the entire random structure [ fig . [ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "more specifically , a constant imaginary refractive index , @xmath25 , is introduced to both dielectric cylinders and background , to avoid any additional scattering caused by the spatial inhomogeneity of @xmath26 .",
    "the ballistic absorption length is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the wavevector , @xmath29 is the density of absorbers , and @xmath30 is the absorption cross - section of each absorber .",
    "the diffusive absorption length , given by @xmath31 , determines the strength of absorption effects . in the weak absorption regime , @xmath32 ,",
    "the average length of diffusive paths inside the random medium @xmath33 is shorter than @xmath34 , thus most scattering paths are barely affected by absorption . in the strong absorption regime , @xmath35 , large attenuation of long scattering paths significantly modifies the transport through the system @xcite .",
    "the next two cases have non - uniform absorption in the disordered waveguides , one is labeled @xmath15 where the absorption is confined to three isolated circles [ fig . [ fig1](b ) ] , the other is @xmath17 which has a single absorbing region in the middle of the waveguide [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) ] .",
    "all the circular absorbing regions have the same diameter @xmath36 , and the space in between the absorbing regions , as well as the distance from an absorbing region to the waveguide sidewall , is larger than the transport mean free path .",
    "when comparing the effects of absorption in the above three cases , the total number of absorbers is kept constant , so that only the spatial distribution of absorbers is different . since @xmath26 is proportional to the density of absorbers @xmath29",
    ", the product @xmath37 is the same , where @xmath38 is the total area of absorbing regions .",

    "light transport changes from diffusive to quasi - ballistic when absorption is strong @xcite . in disordered waveguide with three separate absorbing regions @xmath15 [ fig .",

    "when there is only one absorbing region in the middle of the waveguide @xmath17 [ figure [ fig2](i ) ] , the incoming energy stream splits into two to circumvent the absorbing region .",

    "this can be understood from the results in the previous section .",
    "the spatial distribution of the maximum transmission channel is barely modified by weak absorption , and it experiences the most attenuation when all absorbers are concentrated in the spatial location where its field intensity is maximal ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the lower transmission channels do not penetrate as deep into the random waveguide , thus their intensity maxima are closer to the input end of the wavewguide . the less spatial overlap with the absorbing region leads to lower attenuation , thus the average of transmission eigenvalues @xmath68 decreases more slowly than @xmath66 .    with a further increase of absorption ,",
    "the ratio @xmath85 starts increasing , especially in the case of inhomogeneous absorption ( @xmath15 , @xmath17 ) , its value eventually exceed that without absorption .",
    "this is because the maximum transmission channel bypasses the absorbing regions to reduce the loss , and its transmittance decreases less than other eigenchannels .",
    "thus the reduction of @xmath66 becomes smaller than that of @xmath68 , leading to an increase of their ratio @xmath85 with absorption .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 surpasses its value without absorption at @xmath86 for @xmath15 and @xmath87 for @xmath17 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the diffusive absorption lengths within the absorbing regions in @xmath15 and @xmath17 respectively .",

    "@xmath85 levels off and then increases slightly when @xmath83 [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) ] .",
    "since the absorbers are everywhere in the random waveguide , light in the maximum transmission channel can not bypass absorbers when transmitting through the waveguide .",
    "the only way to minimize loss is to shorten the dwell time inside the waveguide by taking less winding paths when absorption is strong .",

    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows the ratio @xmath96 for @xmath17 , where @xmath60 is the transmission eigenvalue for the @xmath61 channel with absorption and @xmath97 is the eigenvalue without absorption . when absorption is weak @xmath98",
    ", @xmath66 decreases faster than all others .",
    "we also calculate the absorption in each channel , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the reflectance of the @xmath61 transmission eigenchannel .",
    "the absorption in the maximum transmission channel @xmath101 is the largest [ fig . [ fig4](b ) ] , which explains why @xmath66 reduces more than other channels when absorption is weak .",

    "correspondingly , the absorption experienced by the third eigenchannel @xmath103 becomes larger than the first eigenchannel @xmath101 [ fig .",

    ".    the above result can be explained by the modification of these transmission channels by inhomogeneous absorption . in a lossless",

    "are barely changed , thus the first eigenchannel is attenuated more than the third eigenchannel [ brown dotted lines in [ fig4](c , d ) ] .",
    "however , at strong absorption where the diffusive absorption length within the absorbing region becomes shorter than the size of the absorbing region @xmath105 , light transmission through the central absorbing region becomes very low and the scattering paths in the first eigenchannel avoid that region to achieve high transmission as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](i ) .",
    "the circumvention of light paths around the absorbing region helps to reduce the absorption of light and therefore the field intensity in the section of the waveguide behind the absorbing region is higher for the first eigenchannel than the third eigenchannel [ green solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c , d ) ] .",
    "similar modifications of the transmission eigenchannels are observed in the disordered waveguide with three separate absorbing regions @xmath15 . since it is more difficult to bypass three absorbing regions than a single one , the decrease of @xmath66 is higher for @xmath15 than for @xmath17 [ fig .",

    "we have performed a detailed numerical study to understand how spatially non - uniform absorption modifies the transmission eigenchannels in a 2d disordered waveguide . in the weak absorption regime ,",
    "the spatial profile of a transmission channel remains very similar to that without absorption , and the effect of inhomogeneous absorption can be stronger or weaker than homogeneous absorption depending on the spatial overlap of the localized absorbing region with the field intensity maximum of the channel . in the strong absorption regime ,",
    "the high transmission channels redirect the energy flows to circumvent the absorbing region to minimize loss .",

    "compared to other transmission eigenchannels , the one with the largest eigenvalue is the most efficient in bypassing the absorbing regions to transport the maximal amount of energy through the random medium .",
