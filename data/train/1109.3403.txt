    "the divide and color ( dac ) model is a natural dependent site percolation model introduced by hggstrm in @xcite .",
    "it has been studied directly in @xcite , and as a member of a more general family of models in @xcite .",
    "this model is defined on a multigraph @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a multiset ( _ i.e. _ , it may contain an element more than once ) , thus allowing parallel edges between pairs of vertices . for simplicity , we will imprecisely call @xmath0 a _ graph _ and @xmath11 the _ edge set _ , even if @xmath0 contains self - loops or multiple edges . the dac model with parameters",
    "@xmath12 $ ] , on a general ( finite or infinite ) graph @xmath0 with vertex set @xmath13 and edge set @xmath11 , is defined by the following two - step procedure :    * first step : bernoulli bond percolation .",
    "we independently declare each edge in @xmath11 to be open with probability @xmath9 , and closed with probability @xmath1 .",
    "we can identify a bond percolation configuration with an element @xmath14 : for each @xmath15 , we define @xmath16 if @xmath17 is open , and @xmath18 if @xmath17 is closed . *",
    "second step : bernoulli site percolation on the resulting cluster set . given @xmath14 ,",
    "we call _ @xmath9-clusters _ or _ bond clusters _ the connected components in the graph with vertex set @xmath13 and edge set @xmath19 .",
    "the set of @xmath9-clusters of @xmath20 gives a partition of @xmath13 . for each @xmath9-cluster @xmath21",
    ", we assign the same color to all the vertices in @xmath21 .",
    "the chosen color is black with probability @xmath2 and white with probability @xmath3 , and this choice is independent for different @xmath9-clusters .",
    "these two steps yield a site percolation configuration @xmath22 by defining , for each @xmath23 , @xmath24 if @xmath25 is black , and @xmath26 if @xmath25 is white .",
    "the connected components ( via the edge set @xmath11 ) in @xmath27 of the same color are called ( black or white ) _ @xmath2-clusters_. the resulting measure on @xmath28 is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the event that there exists an infinite black @xmath2-cluster . by standard arguments ( see proposition 2.5 in @xcite ) , for each @xmath31 $ ]",
    ", there exists a _",
    "critical coloring value _ @xmath32 $ ] such that @xmath33    the _ critical edge parameter _ @xmath34 $ ] is defined as follows : the probability that there exists an infinite bond cluster is @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , and positive for all @xmath37 .",
    "the latter probability is in fact @xmath38 for all @xmath37 , whence @xmath39 for all such @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath40 law shows that in the case when all the bond clusters are finite , @xmath41 ; nevertheless it is possible that @xmath42 for some @xmath43 ( _ e.g. _ on the square lattice , as soon as @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 ) .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to understand how the critical coloring parameter @xmath5 depends on the edge parameter @xmath9 . since the addition or removal of self - loops obviously does not affect the value of @xmath4",
    ", we will assume that all the graphs @xmath0 that we consider are without self - loops .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 is allowed to contain multiple edges .",
    "our first result , based on a stochastic domination argument , gives bounds on @xmath4 in terms of @xmath46 , which is simply the critical value for bernoulli site percolation on @xmath0 . by the _ degree _ of a vertex @xmath25 , we mean the number of edges incident on @xmath25 ( counted with multiplicity ) .",
    "[ rcbounds ] for any graph @xmath0 with maximal degree @xmath47 , for all @xmath48 , @xmath49    as a direct consequence , we get continuity at @xmath8 of the critical value function :    [ contin0 ] for any graph @xmath0 with bounded degree , @xmath4 is continuous in @xmath9 at @xmath35 .",
    "one could think of an alternative approach to the question , as follows : the dac model can be seen as bernoulli site percolation of the random graph @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the set of bond clusters and two bond clusters are connected by a bond of @xmath52 if and only if they are adjacent in the original graph .",
    "the study of how @xmath4 depends on @xmath9 is then a particular case of a more general question known as the _ locality problem _ : is it true in general that the critical points of site percolation on a graph and a small perturbation of it are always close ? here , for small @xmath9 , the graphs @xmath0 and @xmath53 are somehow very similar , and their critical points are indeed close .",
    "dropping the bounded - degree assumption allows for the easy construction of graphs for which continuity does not hold at @xmath8 :    [ nonbounded ] there exists a graph @xmath0 with @xmath54 such that @xmath5 is discontinuous at @xmath35 .    in general , when @xmath55 , the graph @xmath53 does not have bounded degree , even if @xmath0 does ; this simple remark can be exploited to construct bounded degree graphs for which @xmath5 has discontinuities below the critical point of bond percolation ( though of course not at @xmath35 ) :    [ boundeddegreeconstruction ] there exists a graph @xmath0 of bounded degree satisfying @xmath56 and such that @xmath4 is discontinuous at @xmath57 .",
    "the value @xmath57 in the statement above is not special : in fact , for every @xmath58 , it is possible to generalize our argument to construct a graph with a critical bond parameter above @xmath59 and for which the discontinuity of @xmath60 occurs at @xmath59 .",
    "our main results concerns the case @xmath6 , for which the above does not occur :    [ continp ] the critical coloring value @xmath61 is a continuous function of @xmath9 on the whole interval @xmath7 .",
    "the other , perhaps more anecdotal question we investigate here is whether @xmath5 is monotonic below @xmath62 .",
    "this is the case on the triangular lattice ( because it is constant equal to @xmath57 ) , and appears to hold on @xmath63 in simulations ( see the companion paper @xcite ) .    in the general case",
    ", the question seems to be rather delicate .",
    "intuitively the presence of open edges would seem to make percolation easier , leading to the intuition that the function @xmath64 should be nonincreasing .",
    "theorem 2.9 in @xcite gives a counterexample to this intuition .",
    "it is even possible to construct quasi - transitive graphs on which any monotonicity fails :    [ propnonmononicity ] there exists a quasi - transitive graph @xmath0 such that @xmath5 is not monotone on the interval @xmath65 .",
    "a brief outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we set the notation and collect a few results from the literature in section  [ definitions - section ] . in section  [ section - stochastic - domination ] ,",
    "we stochastically compare @xmath66 with bernoulli site percolation ( theorem  [ stdom ] ) , and show how this result implies proposition  [ rcbounds ] .",
    "we then turn to the proof of theorem  [ continp ] in section  [ contz2-section ] , based on a finite - size argument and the continuity of the probability of cylindrical events .    in section  [ tree - like - section ] , we determine the critical value function for a class of tree - like graphs , and in the following section we apply this to construct most of the examples of graphs we mentioned above .",
    "we start by explicitly constructing the model , in a way which will be more technically convenient than the intuitive one given in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected graph @xmath67 where the set of vertices @xmath68 is countable .",
    "we define a total order `` @xmath69 '' on @xmath13 by saying that @xmath70 if and only if @xmath71 . in this way , for any subset @xmath72",

    "for @xmath84 and @xmath23 , we define the _ bond cluster _ @xmath85 of @xmath25 as the maximal connected induced subgraph containing @xmath25 of the graph with vertex set @xmath13 and edge set @xmath86 , and denote the vertex set of @xmath85 by @xmath87 .    for @xmath88 $ ] and a set @xmath75 , we define @xmath89 as the probability measure on @xmath77 that assigns to each @xmath90 value @xmath38 with probability @xmath91 and @xmath35 with probability @xmath92 , independently for different elements of @xmath75 .",

    "finally , we give a few definitions and results that are necessary for the analysis of the dac model on the square lattice , that is the graph with vertex set @xmath102 and edge set @xmath103 of the square lattice is the graph with vertex set @xmath102 and edge set @xmath104 . in the same manner as in the introduction ,",
