    "the southern ara ob1 association shows evidence of recent star formation that may have been triggered by a supernova event ( herbst & havlen 1977 , hereafter hh77 ; arnal et al .",
    "the remarkable young stellar cluster ngc 6193 lies near the center of ara ob1 and was first studied optically by whiteoak ( 1963 ) .",
    "a more comprehensive optical study was undertaken by hh77 who determined the foreground reddening and derived a distance of 1.32 @xmath10 0.12 kpc .",
    "they identified the higher mass o , b , and a star cluster members , but lower mass members have not yet been isolated .",
    "the cluster is undoubtedly young with age estimates in the range @xmath111.5 - 3.1 myr ( moffat & vogt 1973 , hh77 , vzquez & feinstein 1992 ) .",
    "the central part of the cluster is dominated by two luminous o - type stars hd 150135 and hd 150136 , separated by only @xmath810@xmath3 .",
    "the optical properties of these two o stars are very similar , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "their intense ionizing radiation may be influencing star - formation in the nearby rcw 108 molecular cloud ( comern et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hd 150136 is unusual in several respects .",
    "it is a massive spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) consisting of two o stars in a close 2.662 day orbit and has recently been classified as o3 @xmath2 o6v ( niemela & gamen 2005 , hereafter ng05 ) .",
    "the luminosity class of the primary is not well - determined . for typical o star masses ,",
    "the short 2.662 day period implies a separation of just a few stellar radii . at this close separation",
    ", wind - wind interaction is expected .",
    "in addition , hd 150136 is a strong centimeter radio source , and most of its radio flux is nonthermal ( benaglia et al . 2001 ) . a fainter object ( v = 9.0 mag ) is visible @xmath81.6@xmath3 north of hd 150136 ( mason et al .",
    "1998 ) , and we show here that this source is also visible in the near - infrared ( sec .",
    "3.3 ) . by comparison , hd 150135 is slightly fainter than hd 150136 in the optical and radio .",
    "its binary status is uncertain , but it has been classified as a possible spectroscopic binary ( garmany et al .",
    "1980 ; arnal et al . 1988 ) .",
    "although ngc 6193 has been studied optically , there are no previous pointed x - ray observations .",
    "however , a bright x - ray source was detected near the position of hd 150136 (= hr 6187 ) in the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "this x - ray source was identified with hd 150136 by berghfer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who obtained a luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band of log l@xmath12 ( ergs s@xmath5 ) = 33.05 , making it the most luminous o star detected in the rass .",
    "this bright source was also serendipitously detected in a 8460 s _ rosat _ pspc exposure ( image rp900554n00 ) at a @xmath820@xmath0 off - axis position with a count rate of 0.36 c s@xmath5 , which is 40% less than reported from the rass detection .",
    "the presence of a luminous ( and possibly variable ) x - ray source in the _ rosat _ images at or near the hd 150136 position motivated us to undertake a more detailed x - ray study of the ngc 6193 cluster core with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( cxo ) .",
    "our primary objectives were to use _",
    "chandra s _ high angular resolution to determine the precise origin of the bright x - ray emission detected by _",
    "rosat _ and to acquire a grating spectrum capable of identifying the x - ray emission process .",
    "in addition , the sensitive ( 90 ksec ) _ chandra _ observation provides the first high - quality x - ray image of the region immediately surrounding the central o stars hd 150135 and hd 150136 , allowing us to catalog the x - ray emitting population in the cluster core .",
    "_ chandra _ resolves the bright central x - ray source into two components corresponding to separate but unequal contributions from hd 150135 and hd 150136 .",
    "thus , the luminous x - ray source detected by _",
    "rosat _ is found to be the superimposed contribution of the two bright o stars lying 10@xmath3 apart .",
    "interestingly , the long _ chandra _ exposure shows that the emission of hd 150136 is slowly variable on a timescale of @xmath91 day .",
    "grating x - ray spectra of hd 150135 and 150136 are similar ( but not identical ) and soft emission is prevalent in both stars , implying a wind shock origin .",
    "we identify 43 x - ray sources in the central @xmath82@xmath0 @xmath1 2@xmath0 region of the cluster .",
    "all of these have near - ir counterparts and about one - third show x - ray variability , thus being viable candidates for low - mass cluster members .",

    "since short - term ( @xmath111 day ) variability is rarely detected in extragalactic agns , it is likely that that most of the twelve variable sources other than hd 150136 and cd@xmath1648 11069 are stellar .    to distinguish between soft and hard sources , the mean photon energy @xmath6e@xmath7 of each source ( table 2 )",

    "most sources have @xmath6e@xmath7 @xmath8 1.8 - 2 kev , which is typical of coronal emission from low - mass stars .",
    "three of the massive ob stars show a much softer photon energy distribution that is suggestive of a different x - ray emission process , probably related to shocks in their winds .",
    "these are hd 150135 , hd 150136 , and cd@xmath1648 11071 .",
    "the latter star has spectral type b0v and was the softest source detected in the central region with @xmath6e@xmath7 = 0.87 kev .",

    "it has been variously classified as b0 - 1 v or b0 iv ( reed & beatty 1995 ) , and radial velocity variations ( arnal et al .",
    "1988 ) indicate that it is a binary .",
    "it is thus possible that the x - rays are due to a lower mass companion .    except for the two bright o stars , only five other x - ray sources in table 2 have @xmath31100 counts ( sources 5 , 14 , 25 , 26a , 34 ) .",
    "thus , spectral fitting is in most cases not practical because of insufficient counts .",
    "however , we did fit the ccd spectra of the above five sources with simple absorbed one - temperature ( 1 t ) and two - temperature ( 2 t ) @xmath32 optically thin plasma models in xspec version 11.3.1 .",
    "the fit parameters have large uncertainties but acceptable 2 t fits were obtained with a cool component at kt@xmath33 @xmath8 0.1 - 0.4 kev and a hotter component at kt@xmath34 @xmath8 1.6 - 4.5 kev .",
    "the highest temperatures were inferred for sources 14 and 25 , both of which are variable and thus likely to be magnetically - active low - mass stars .",
    "the mean ( median ) absorption from 2 t fits of these five stars was n@xmath21 = 5.0 ( 3.5 ) @xmath1 10@xmath22 @xmath23 , with a range of a factor of @xmath113 .",

    "this is source 30 , which is associated with a k = 11.19 2mass counterpart and a r = 13.5 mag _ hst _ guide star catalog ( gsc ) source .",
    "the gsc classifies the object as non - stellar .",
    "thus , the most reliable jhk data presently available suggest that the fraction of x - ray sources with near - ir excesses is quite low .",
    "however , higher spatial resolution near - ir photometry is needed to obtain reliable colors for closely spaced sources along with mid - ir photometry to search for cooler dust emission that might be present .",
    "the pico dos dias images confirm a previously detected optical source ( v = 9.0 ) located just north of hd 150136 ( mason et al .",
    "this source is clearly visible in our 2.14@xmath25 image ( fig .",
    "4 ) at an offset of @xmath81.7@xmath3 north of hd 150136 .",
    "we estimate from pico dos dias photometry that it is @xmath82.4 mag fainter than hd 150136 at 2.14 @xmath25 m , but higher angular resolution will be needed to clearly separate the two .",
    "if this star is at the same distance as hd 150136 and has similar a@xmath38 , then it would correspond to an early b spectral type for a main sequence object .",
    "no significant x - ray emission is seen from this star , which is in the wings of the _ chandra _ psf of hd 150136 .",
    "although the two closely - spaced o stars hd 150135 and hd 150136 have similar optical properties , their x - ray properties show differences , as discussed below .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath12 ) of hd 150136 is about 4 times larger than hd 150135 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the high l@xmath12 of hd 150136 is exceptional , making it one of the brightest ( if not _ the _",
    "brightest ) x - ray sources in the o star class .",
    "but , the hd 150136 sb2 system has a larger bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath39 ) than hd 150135 by virtue of its earlier o3 primary and o6v companion . as a result ,",
    "the l@xmath12/l@xmath39 ratios of hd 150135 and hd 150136 are nearly identical ( table 1 ) .",
    "the rass study of ob stars by berghfer et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) established a correlation log l@xmath12 = 1.13  log l@xmath39 @xmath16 11.89 , with a standard deviation of 0.40 dex for stars with log l@xmath39 ( ergs s@xmath5 ) @xmath31 38 .",
    "however , many ob stars were not detected in the short rass exposures , so the mean l@xmath12 deduced from rass data is probably too high .",
    "a similar correlation was found in _ einstein _",
    "data for o stars by sciortino et al .",
    "( 1990 ) . as shown in figure 5 , the ( l@xmath12 , l@xmath39 ) values for hd 150135 and hd 150136 are well within the scatter of the rass sample , which is quite large .",
    "thus , the ( l@xmath12 , l@xmath39 ) values for these two o stars do not seem unusual , but the high l@xmath12 of hd 150136 is extreme for an o star .",
    "figure 6 shows the 0th order acis - s light curves of both hd 150135 and hd 150136 .",
    "we have considered the effects of pileup , which occurs when two or more photons are detected as a single event .",

    "the low pileup level in hd 150135 is negligible and the moderate level in hd 150136 will cause the count rate to be slighly underestimated in the 0th order light curve but does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the grating data are unaffected .",
    "no significant variability was detected in hd 150135 , but hd 150136 is clearly variable .",
    "its count rate dropped slowly by about 38% during the first 39 ksec of the observation .",
    "it then increased slowly back to levels near the initial value .",
    "the first order meg1 light curve shows similar behavior .",
    "in addition , we extracted a light curve using a small rectangular extraction region of size 6 @xmath1 3 pixels ( 2.9@xmath3 ew @xmath1 1.5@xmath3 ns ) centered on hd 150136 .",
    "this region excluded the faint optical / ir source located 1.7@xmath3 to the north , which in any case is not clearly detected in the x - ray images .",
    "the x - ray light curve variability is still present , implying that the faint optical / ir companion is not the cause of the x - ray variability .",
    "a k - s analysis of the 0th order light curve of hd 150136 using events in the 0.5 - 5 kev range gives a probability of constant count rate p(const ) = 2.4 @xmath1 10@xmath30 .",
    "to further investigate the nature of the variability , we extracted energy - filtered light curves of hd 150136 in soft ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) and hard ( 1.5 - 5 kev ) bands .",
    "we found no significant variation in the hardness ratio during the light curve dip .",
    "in addition , we extracted and fitted 0th order spectra of hd 150136 during the light curve dip ( t = 24 - 48 ksec ) and after the dip ( t = 55 - 90 ksec ) .",
    "fits of these spectra with two - temperature optically thin plasma models show no significant differences in temperature or absorption .",
    "however , the total emission measure ( sum of both temperature components ) during the light curve dip is only 27% of that in the post - dip spectrum .",
    "the above analysis shows that the x - ray variability in hd 150136 was linked to a drop in the emission measure and was not accompanied by any significant temperature change .",
    "this suggests that the variability may have resulted from a partial obscuration of the x - ray emitting region , as discussed further in section 5.8 .",
    "figure 7 shows the 0th order spectra of hd 150135 and hd 150136 , and figures 8 - 9 show their meg1 spectra .",
    "we have analyzed the 0th order and 1st order hetg spectra of both hd 150135 and hd 150136 using a variety of different models .",
    "these include discrete temperature models with one ( 1 t ) , two ( 2 t ) , and three ( 3 t ) temperature components , and differential emission measure ( dem ) models .",
    "spectra were rebinned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin for spectral fitting .",
    "all models included an absorption component based on morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) cross sections .",
    "discrete temperature models were based on the @xmath40 module in xspec , which utilizes the recent aped atomic data base and includes a @xmath41 fit parameter that accounts for line broadening .",
    "the dem was constructed using a modified version of the xspec chebyshev polynomial model @xmath42 ( lemen et al .",
    "1989 ) , as discussed below .",
    "overall , our most robust results are based on fits of the meg1 spectrum of hd 150136 , which provides good spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) data .",
    "measurements of line properties of some lines were also possible using heg1 spectra of hd 150136 ( table 4 ) , which provides higher spectral resolution than meg1 at lower s / n . because of its lower flux , our spectral fits of hd 150135 are restricted to 0th order and meg1 spectra only .",
    "acceptable fits of 0th order spectra can be obtained using 2 t models , as summarized in table 3 .",
    "the spectra of both hd 150135 and hd 150136 are quite soft with characteristic temperatures of kt @xmath8 0.2 - 0.3 kev .",
    "the meg1 spectrum of hd 150135 can be acceptably fit with a 1 t model having kt = 0.3 kev , and the 2 t model ( table 3 ) provides only a slight improvement .",
    "in contrast , the 2 t model provides a significant improvement over 1 t in hd 150136 .",
    "further modest fit improvement can be obtained with a 3 t model in hd 150136 , which includes a third temperature component at kt @xmath8 1.6 kev , but only 9% of the total emission measure is attributed to this component .      the dem distribution of hd 150136 based on modeling of its meg1 spectrum ( 8780 net counts ) is shown in figure 10 .",
    "the dem was determined by a global fit of the spectrum using a modified version of the @xmath42 chebyshev polynomial algorithm in xspec that incorporates recent aped atomic data .",
    "this global fitting strategy takes the underlying continuum into account in reconstructing the dem .",
    "line broadening was modeled by applying the gaussian smoothing function @xmath43 .",
    "abundances were varied and converged to values close to those obtained for the 2 t model ( table 3 ) , with an inferred iron abundance fe = 0.32 @xmath10 0.09 ( @xmath101@xmath44 ) solar .    as seen in figure 10 ,",
    "the dem of hd 150136 is quite soft , with a single peak near kt @xmath8 0.2 kev .",
    "the precise value of the peak is somewhat uncertain , but is very likely below 0.4 kev .",
    "we find no evidence of a second hotter emission peak but some plasma up to at least kt @xmath8 1 kev is inferred from the dem profile .",
    "we also attempted to reconstruct the dem of hd 150135 using the chebyshev polynomial method applied to its meg1 spectrum ( 1100 net counts ) .",
    "the inferred dem is very similar to that of hd 150136 , showing a single soft peak below kt @xmath8 0.4 kev , with almost all fits peaking at kt @xmath8 0.2 - 0.3 kev .",
    "one discernible difference is that the dem of hd 150135 seems to be more sharply peaked , with less fractional contribution from hotter plasma at temperatures above the peak .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our discrete temperature models , which also indicate a slightly cooler plasma distribution in hd 150135 .",
    "the emission line properties of hd 150135 and hd 150136 are quite similar .",
    "both stars show broadened lines with typical broadening of fwhm @xmath82400 - 2500 km s@xmath5 ( table 3 ) , no significant line centroid shifts , and little or no asymmetry .",
    "table 4 summarizes the line properties of hd 150136 , which are more reliably determined than for the fainter line emission of hd 150135 .",
    "even so , the o vii line in hd 150136 is faint and the uncertainties in its width and centroid are larger than for the other lines .",
    "a notable result is that the higher temperature s xv and si xiv lines were detected in hd 150136 ( fig .",

    "meg1 spectral simulations show that if the temperature structure of hd 150135 were the same as that of hd 150136 , these two lines should have been detected in hd 150135 in spite of its lower count rate .",
    "we thus conclude that the plasma of hd 150136 is slightly hotter than that of hd 150135 , as already suggested by discrete temperature models .      observed fluxes were measured for the resonance ( @xmath45 ) , intercombination ( @xmath46 ) , and forbidden ( @xmath47 ) line components in he - like triplets of hd 150136 using 1st order grating spectra .",

    ", line broadening was taken into account .",
    "the line width was allowed to vary during the fit , but the widths of all three components were constrained to be equal .    the @xmath50 ratio is sensitive to temperature and the @xmath48 ratio is sensitive to the electron density ( @xmath51 ) and stellar uv radiation field ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ) . if @xmath52 is the photoexcitation rate from the 1@xmath152@xmath15  @xmath53 @xmath47 level to the 1@xmath152@xmath54  @xmath55 @xmath46 level , then @xmath48 = @xmath56/[1 @xmath2 ( @xmath52/@xmath57 ) @xmath2 ( @xmath51/@xmath58 ) ] , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the critical photoexcitation rate and critical density ( blumenthal , drake , & tucker 1972 ; porquet et al .",

    "we have used solar abundance cross - sections ( balucinska - church & mccammon 1992 ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) along with the o3 stellar parameters in table 5 .",
    "thus , the optical depth constraint places the region of line formation for ne ix outside the radius at which density suppression would be important .",
    "we emphasize that this conclusion rests on the assumption of a spherical homogeneous wind .",
    "if the wind is clumped ( sec .",
    "5.4 ) , then r@xmath71 is reduced and line formation could occur at smaller radii than inferred above .",
    "it is more likely that the low r values result from photoexcitation by the strong uv field of the o3 @xmath2 o6v system .",
    "the distance at which uv effects become significant is measured by the critical radius r@xmath72 , where the photoexcitation rate from the upper level of the @xmath47 transition equals the spontaneous decay rate from that same level .",

    "the meg1 spectrum of hd 150136 is of sufficient quality to derive basic abundance information ( table 4 ) , the strongest result is that fe is underabundant with respect to the solar photospheric value by a factor of @xmath84 - 5 , and quite likely ne as well .",

    "the luminosity class of the o3 primary is not well - determined , and we consider both o3i and o3v .",

    "thus , this remarkable o @xmath2 o system is nearly in contact .",
    "as a result of the close separation , interaction of the o3 and o6v winds seems unavoidable and may lead to x - ray emission from a colliding wind ( cw ) shock , as discussed further below .",

    "the radio continuum emission of hd 150135 ( and hd 150136 ) is unusually strong for a star of its spectral type , giving further reason to suspect binarity .",
    "the flux density of hd 150135 increases with frequency with a 3.5 cm value s@xmath76 = 0.28 @xmath10 0.03 mjy ( benaglia et al . 2001 ) . if this flux is attributed entirely to free - free wind emission , then the inferred mass loss rate at d = 1.3 kpc is log @xmath77 = @xmath165.4 m@xmath78 yr@xmath5 .",
    "this value is about an order of magnitude larger than determined for other o6.5v stars ( garmany et al .",
    "1981 ; lamers & leitherer 1993 ) .",
    "it is thus possible that some of the radio flux is nonthermal , as is the case for hd 150136 .",
    "the above results point toward binarity in hd 150135 , but nothing is known about the putative companion .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data do not show any telltale hints of binarity such as variability or hard x - ray emission that might arise in a colliding wind shock .",

    "( 1990 ) ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "an estimate of the terminal wind speed is available for hd 150136 ( prinja et al .",
    "1990 ) but not for hd 150135 .",
    "both stars are radio continuum sources ( benaglia et al .",
    "2001 ) , but hd 150136 contains a nonthermal contribution , as may hd 150135 ( sec .",
    "thus , estimates of the mass loss rates based on radio continuum fluxes are likely to be incorrect . in the absence of reliable observational data ,",
    "we have adopted the mass loss parameters given in table 5 , which are representative of o3 and o6v stars in general .",
    "the line widths of hd 150136 in table 4 reveal interesting trends the widths of all lines are similar , with a mean @xmath79 = 2100 km s@xmath5 . then , @xmath80 = 1050 km s@xmath5 , or @xmath80 @xmath8 v@xmath81/3 ( table 5 ) .",
    "thus , the lines are broadened , but not nearly as broad as might be expected if they were formed in the outer wind where the wind is at terminal speed .",
    "a similar situation exists for hd 150135 , whose mean line width as determined from meg1 spectra is nearly identical to that found in hd 150136 .",
    "recent _ chandra _ grating observations of other young o stars such as @xmath44 ori ab ( o9.5v ) also show very moderate line broadening with hwhm @xmath8 @xmath65/4 ( skinner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "if one attributes the broadening to x - ray line formation in an outflowing stellar wind ( owocki & cohen 2001 ) , then a @xmath68 = 1 wind acceleration profile ( sec . 4.3.4 ) gives @xmath64 = @xmath80 = 1050 km s@xmath5 at @xmath45 @xmath8 1.5 r@xmath66 .",

    "thus , there is an apparent contradiction .",
    "moderately broadened lines suggest that the lines are formed in the wind acceration zone close to the star , but optical depth calculations require larger formation radii for cooler lines , where the wind should be at or near its terminal speed",
    ".    the above inconsistency may be due to our imprecise knowledge of the mass loss parameters , wind opacities , and wind structure .",
    "the wind acceleration profile is not empirically determined , and the mass - loss rate , which enters into the optical depth unity calculation , is poorly - known .",
    "lastly , the assumption of a spherical homogeneous wind may be overly simplistic .",
    "it has been suggested that o star winds may be clumped and that clumping could account for discrepancies in o star mass loss rates determined by different methods ( fullerton et al .",
    "2004 ; repolust et al .",
    "if the wind is clumped then the optical depth at a given line energy would be reduced and line photons could escape from smaller radii than indicated by figure 12 , resulting in less broadening than expected for a homogeneous wind ( owocki & cohen 2001 ) .",
    "the close separation in the hd 150136 o3 @xmath2 o6 system virtually assures wind - wind interaction .",
    "we would thus like to know if some or all of its prodigious x - ray emission could be due a colliding wind shock , which is expected to form in the harsh radiation environment between the two o stars .",
    "there are indeed signs that the x - ray emission of hd 150136 may be influenced by binarity . as we have seen , its x - ray emission is slightly hotter and a factor of four more luminous than its optical twin hd 150135 .",
    "in addition , its strong nonthermal radio emission may signal shock processes .",
    "because of the close binary separation , the radiation - hydrodynamics problem is coupled and is challenging to model numerically .      the temperature of shocked gas at the shock interface in an _",
    "adiabatic _ colliding wind shock is proportional to the square of the pre - shock wind velocity component normal to the interface ( eq . [ 1 ] . of luo",

    "in contrast , we detect very little hot plasma above @xmath111 kev in hd 150136 ( fig .",
    "because of its closer separation , the winds will not have reached terminal speeds before colliding and radiative cooling will be important . as a result , colliding wind shock emission could be present at lower temperatures than predicted in the adiabatic case .",
    "the parameter used to determine whether a colliding wind shock is adiabatic or non - adiabatic is the ratio @xmath82 = t@xmath83/t@xmath84 , where t@xmath83 is the characteristic cooling time for shock - heated gas and t@xmath84 is the escape time for gas to flow out of the intershock region .",
    "if @xmath82 @xmath69 1 then the system is adiabatic while @xmath82 @xmath73 1 implies the system is non - adiabatic and radiative cooling is important .",

    "thus , hd 150136 is a non - adiabatic system .",
    "the numerical hydrodynamic simulation of colliding winds in closely - spaced non - adiabatic systems is complex .",
    "cooling processes and wind acceleration must be taken into account .",
    "also , radiative braking may be important , whereby the radiation of one o star slows the wind of its companion ( owocki & gayley 1995 ) . the presence of a mathematical singularity at the stagnation point on the line - of - centers has hindered the development of rigorous numerical hydrodynamic models , as discussed by myasnikov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "because of the above complexities , we have only developed simplified hydrodynamic cw simulations of hd 150136 to date .",
    "we assume o3v @xmath2 o6v wind parameters , a @xmath68 = 1 velocity law , and the orbit solution of ng05 .",
    "the simulations invoke wind momentum balance and the shock surfaces are assumed to follow the contact discontinuity ( luo et al .",

    "roughly half of the observed flux could come from the o stars themselves .",
    "however , we note that our _ a priori _ estimate of the emission measure from the cw shock is a few times larger than needed to accurately reproduce the meg1 spectrum .",

    "further refinements in the cw shock model will include radiative braking and accounting for the effects of orbital motion on the emission line properties .",
    "x - ray grating spectra recently obtained for several massive young stars have sparked renewed interest in the possibility that their winds might in some cases be magnetically confined .",
    "this has been the result of the detection of narrow emission lines and hot plasma ( kt @xmath69 2 kev ) in young objects such as the o star @xmath87 ori c ( schulz et al . 2000 ) and the unusual b star @xmath88 sco ( cohen et al . 2003 ) .",

    "the degree to which the wind is confined by the field is measured by the confinement parameter @xmath89 = ( 0.4  b@xmath90r@xmath91)/(@xmath92@xmath93 ) where b@xmath94 is the equatorial magnetic field surface strength in units of 100 g , r@xmath95 is the stellar radius in units of 10@xmath96 cm , @xmath92 is the mass loss rate in units of 10@xmath97 m@xmath78 yr@xmath5 , and @xmath93 is the wind speed in units of 10@xmath98 cm s@xmath5 . if @xmath89 @xmath31 1 ( strong confinement ) then the wind is confined by the b field and is channeled toward the magnetic equator , where the wind components from each hemisphere collide to form a magnetically confined wind shock ( mcws ) , accompanied by hard x - ray emission ( babel & montmerle 1997 ) . if @xmath89 @xmath9 1 ( weak confinement ) , the field is opened by the dominant wind and no hard x - rays are predicted .",

    "typical x - ray luminosities predicted by shell - collision simulations are log l@xmath4 @xmath8 32.3 ( ergs s@xmath5 ) , with model - dependent standard deviations of @xmath100.4 to @xmath100.6 .",
    "this predicted l@xmath4 is about an order of magnitude less than determined for hd 150136 , even after halving the total l@xmath4 ( table 1 ) to account for two stars in the system .",
    "it thus remains to be shown that the shell - collision mechanism can account for the very high x - ray luminosity and slow variability of hd 150136 .    finally , we consider dynamic effects .",
    "these are indeed relevant because hd 150136 is known to be a 2.662 d binary . during our observation ,",
    "the orbital phase of hd 150136 ranged from @xmath52 = 0.1 - 0.5 , where the primary is in front at @xmath52 = 0.5 ( ng05 ) .",
    "the dip in the light curve is centered near @xmath52 @xmath8 0.27 ( fig . 6 ) . at this phase ,",
    "the system is near quadrature , with the o3 primary approaching the observer and the o6 secondary receding .    in colliding wind systems ,",
    "x - ray variability can be induced by orbital motion .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of a cw shock is predicted to scale inversely as the distance between the two components ( sbp92 ) , but the orbit of hd 150136 is nearly circular ( @xmath74 = 0.03 ; ng05 ) so no significant variability due to changes in orbital separation is expected .",
    "also , a reduction in the observed x - ray flux can occur in colliding wind binaries from increased wind absorption as the primary moves in front of the secondary .",
    "again , this does not explain the dip in the hd 150136 light curve , which occurs near quadrature and not when the primary is in front .",
    "to explain the light curve dip at quadrature in terms of colliding wind geometry , one would have to postulate that some of the cw shock emission on the downstream side of the secondary is being shadowed by the secondary itself .",
    "a possible clue to the origin of the x - ray variability comes from the optical spectra of ng05 .",
    "they note that the radial velocity changes in the he i absorption lines of hd 150136 do not follow the orbital motion of either the primary or secondary .",
    "furthermore , they detect an _ additional _ faint absorption component redward of the he i absorption lines when the secondary of the sb2 system has maximum positive radial velocity , which occurs at phase @xmath52 = 0.25 .",
    "this may signal the presence of a third massive star in the system .",
    "we emphasize that this putative third component in the spectroscopic system is _ not _ the faint star lying 1.7@xmath3 to the north ( fig .",
    "4 ) , whose position is well - known from optical studies ( mason et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it may not be a coincidence that the appearance of the additional optical absorption component occurs at @xmath52 = 0.25 , where the dip in the x - ray spectrum is also observed ( fig .",
    "if the additional absorption feature is due to a massive third component moving in front at @xmath52 = 0.25 , then this third star ( or its wind ) could be partially occulting the x - ray emitting region .",
    "such an occultation would be consistent with the observed decline in emission measure , without an accompanying temperature change .",
    "however , a physical connection between the x - ray variability and the putative third star remains quite speculative .",
    "it might be argued that a physical connection is unlikely , since it seems to require that the orbit of the third star be synchronous with that of the sb2 system .",
    "clearly , further observational work is needed to determine if there is a connection .",
    "this would include confirmation of the existence of the putative third star , determination of its spectral type and orbit , and extended time monitoring to search for periodicity in the x - ray light curve .",
    "a final possibility worth mentioning is that the x - ray variability of hd 150136 might be due to rotational modulation of an x - ray emitting structure that is close to the star .",
    "in that case , the observed variability could result from self - occulation , rather than from occultation by a putative third star in the system .",
    "rotational self - occultation has been invoked to explain the x - ray variability of @xmath87 ori c ( gagn et al . 2005 ) .",
    "its variability is caused by a change in emission measure without an accompanying temperature change , which is qualitatively similar to the behavior that we see in hd 150136 .",
    "the key question that remains is whether the x - ray variability in hd 150136 is periodic and if so , what is the period ?",
    "we have presented results of the first x - ray observation targeted at the center of the young stellar cluster ngc 6193 in the ara ob1 association , supplemented by ground - based near - ir images .",
    "the main results of this study are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "_ chandra _ detected 43 x - ray sources in a @xmath82@xmath0 @xmath1 2@xmath0 region centered on the o stars hd 150135 and hd 150136 .",
    "the strong x - ray emission previously seen by _ rosat _ is now attributed to separate but unequal contributions from hd 150135 and hd 150136 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of hd 150136 is exceptional ( log l@xmath4 = 33.39 ergs s@xmath5 ) making it one of the most x - ray luminous o stars known .",
    "all 43 x - ray sources in the central cluster region have near - ir counterparts , but only eleven have optical identifications .",
    "one of these , the early b star cd@xmath1648 11069 , shows an unusually hard photon energy distribution , raising the possibility that its x - ray emission arises in a low - mass companion .",
    "the population of fainter x - ray sources surrounding the central o stars is characterized by moderately hard emission with mean photon energies @xmath6e@xmath7 @xmath8 2 kev and about one - third are variable .",
    "the variable objects are promising candidates for low - mass pre - main - sequence stars in the cluster , but membership remains to be determined .",
    "the available jhk photometry suggest that the fraction of x - ray sources in the central cluster region with near - ir excesses is low .",
    "further searches for excesses in the mid - ir are needed .",
    "high - quality x - ray grating spectra of hd 150135 and hd 150136 show similar , but not identical , spectral properties . in both stars ,",
    "the emission is dominated by cool plasma ( kt @xmath8 0.3 kev ) .",
    "the emission lines show no significant centroid shifts and are moderately broadened to hwhm @xmath8 @xmath65/3 . broadened lines and cool plasma implicate wind shock emission as the origin of the x - rays .",
    "forbidden lines in he - like triplets are strongly suppressed by the hd 150136 uv radiation field , implying that some high - temperature lines such as s xv form in the wind - acceleration zone within a few radii of the star .",
    "optical depth and line broadening considerations hint that the wind may be clumped .",
    "the exceptionally high x - ray luminosity of hd 150136 , along with nonthermal radio emission , suggest that colliding wind shocks may be present in this closely - spaced o3",
    "@xmath2 o6v binary .",
    "however , simplified numerical simulations show that a cw shock alone can not account for all of the observed x - ray properties .",
    "if cw emission is present , then it is supplemented by another cool x - ray component , which likely originates in the shocked winds of the individual o stars .",
    "an unexpected result is that the x - ray emission of hd 150136 is slowly variable on a timescale of @xmath701 day .",
    "the variability is due to a change in the emission measure , with little or no change in x - ray temperature , suggesting that it is an occultation effect .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the occultation is not yet known , but self - occultation due to stellar rotation or partial occultation of the x - ray emitting region by a putative third star in the hd 150136 system are possibilities",
    ". further observational work , including long - term x - ray monitoring , will be needed to identify the origin of the x - ray variability .",
