    "[ [ section ] ]    let @xmath0 be a ( not necessarily compact ) complex manifold and let @xmath1 be a divisor with normal crossings , whose irreducible components @xmath2 are smooth . let @xmath8 be the category of parabolic vector bundles over @xmath6 in which the lengths of the filtrations over the irreducible components @xmath2 of @xmath9 are given by the natural numbers @xmath3 ( see section [ ncd ] for a precise definition ) .    in this paper we construct a manifold @xmath4 endowed with an action of an algebraic torus @xmath5 and an invariant projection @xmath10 we define a full subcategory @xmath11 of the category of equivariant vector bundles over @xmath4 , and we construct a functor @xmath12 which induces an equivalence of categories ( see theorem [ mainthmur ] ) .    when @xmath0 is kaehler we describe the kaehler cone of @xmath4 in terms of that of @xmath0 .",
    "afterwards , for any choice of kaehler class @xmath13 of @xmath0 and parabolic weights @xmath14 we construct a family of kaehler classes @xmath15 on @xmath4 parametrized by @xmath16 and we prove that for small enough @xmath17 the notions of @xmath18-parabolic slope stability and that of @xmath15-slope stability for equivariant vector bundles correspond each other by the equivalence of categories ( see theorem [ estabilitat ] ) . for any set of weights @xmath14 we have @xmath19 so when @xmath20 the volume of the fibres of @xmath21 tends to @xmath22 . in this sense , our result could be thought of as a statement on stability of vector bundles in the adiabatic limit .",
    "the functor @xmath23 gives also an equivalence of categories of families of ( parabolic , equivariant ) vector bundles parametrized by complex spaces @xmath24 , and in some particular cases our results allow to identify the two moduli problems .",
    "the construction of @xmath25 is functorial with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath9 in the following sense : if @xmath26 is a map of complex manifolds which is transverse to @xmath9 , then we have an induced map @xmath27 which makes the following diagram commutative : @xmath28 ^ -{f_{d,{{\\underline}{r}}}}\\ar[d ] & x(d,{{\\underline}{r}})\\ar[d ] \\\\",

    "hence , the condition of some equivariant vector bundle @xmath31 being an object of @xmath11 is purely topological .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the ideas in this paper are very similar of those of biswas in @xcite ( see also the references therein ) .",

    "biswas also relates the stability conditions of the parabolic sheaf and of the equivariant one .",
    "in contrast with our case , however , the manifold @xmath32 depends not only on @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 , but also on the choice of the parabolic weights . it would be interesting to relate the approach of biswas to that of this paper .    from another point of view",
    ", the results which we present here are related to those of garca ",
    "prada @xcite , in which holomorphic pairs are studied in terms of equivariant vector bundles .",
    "the ideas of garca  prada have been successfully applied to other situations dealing with holomorphic bundles with extra structure ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "the manifold @xmath35 inherits an action from the diagonal action of @xmath38 on @xmath36 which is trivial on the @xmath0 factor and which is defined on @xmath39 as @xmath40:=[y:\\theta w]$ ] .",
    "next we consider the case of @xmath9 smooth and @xmath41 .",
    "we construct a tower of manifolds @xmath42 by applying recursively the previous construction , so that @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is a certain smooth divisor which lies over @xmath9 , and each manifold @xmath45 carries an action of @xmath46 .    finally , when @xmath47 is a normal crossing divisor , we define @xmath4 to be the fibred product @xmath48 this carries a diagonal action of @xmath49 .",
    "the fibres of @xmath21 over @xmath50 are products of @xmath39 s , and those over @xmath9 are singular , their irreducible components being products of @xmath39 s .",
    "in fact , @xmath4 can be constructed by making a sequence of blow ups along subvarieties of a product @xmath51 which lie above @xmath9 .    the category @xmath11 and the functor @xmath23 are also defined inductively , following the construction of @xmath4 .",
    "the main point is to define @xmath23 in the case @xmath9 smooth and @xmath52 , since everything is built up by applying recursively the construction in this simplest case .",
    "the proof that @xmath23 induces an equivalence of categories and some of the computations needed to prove the relation with mumford ",
    "takemoto stability are also obtained by reducing to this simple case .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    we now explain the contents of the following sections . in section [ sec : equibdls ] we give some definitions and results on equivariant vector bundles which will be used along the paper . in section [ construccioxd ]",
