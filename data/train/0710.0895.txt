    "in three spatial dimensions , only two types of statistical behaviors have been observed dividing particles into two groups : bosons and fermions . if one is restricted to two - dimensional systems the situation changes .",
    "there , anyons  @xcite can appear , which exhibit fractional statistics that ranges continuously from bosonic to fermionic .",
    "anyons are responsible for the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite and it has been demonstrated that they could be realized as quasiparticles in highly entangled many - body systems .",
    "formally , the properties of anyons are described by two - dimensional topological quantum field theories  @xcite that dictate their trivial dynamical , but complex statistical behavior . in general , it is expected that such topological quantum field theories come into effect at low energies of highly correlated many - body systems , such as quantum liquids  @xcite . however , the observation of anyonic features requires high population in the system s ground state , high purity samples and , above all , the ability to separate the anyonic effects from the dynamical background of the strongly interacting system . in spite of significant experimental progress  @xcite the fractional statistics of anyons",
    "has not yet been conclusively confirmed due to the complexity of these systems  @xcite .    to demonstrate characteristic anyonic features we employ here a different strategy .",
    "we simulate the toric code model  @xcite in a quantum system without the continuous presence of interactions  @xcite .",
    "the toric code is a two - dimensional topological lattice model , where anyons are spatially well localized .",
    "recently , several proposals showed how the toric code could possibly be implemented on extended lattices of qubits enabling one to employ anyonic states for , e.g. , protected quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "while such a quantum computational scheme requires large systems , here we show that a number of anyonic properties can be demonstrated by considering four - partite entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states  @xcite .",
    "these states are dynamically encoded in the polarization of photons , rather than produced via cooling  @xcite .",
    "this provides the additional advantage of being subject to negligible decoherence due to the weak coupling of photons to the environment .",
    "polarized photons as qubits are a well understood and controllable quantum optical system that already allowed to observe the four - qubit ghz state  @xcite . here",
    "we employ this system to simulate anyonic behavior .",
    "the anyonic model under consideration is based on the toric code proposed by kitaev  @xcite and is described in detail in tutorial introductions  @xcite .",
    "this system can be defined on a two - dimensional square lattice with interacting qubits placed at its vertices . to facilitate the description of the interactions let us split the lattice into two alternating types of plaquettes labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as in .",
    "the defining hamiltonian is @xmath2 where the summations run over the corresponding plaquettes and the indices @xmath3 of the pauli operators , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , enumerate the vertices of each plaquette in a counter - clockwise fashion .",
    "each of the @xmath1- or @xmath0-plaquette interaction terms commute with the hamiltonian as well as with each other .",
    "thus , the model is exactly solvable and its ground state is explicitly given by  @xcite @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the state @xmath8 represents the anyonic vacuum state and it is unique for systems with open boundary conditions .     on a single",
    "qubit yields two @xmath9-type anyons placed at the neighboring @xmath1 plaquettes , where the string passes trough the rotated qubits .",
    "similarly , @xmath10 anyons are created on @xmath0 plaquettes by @xmath5 rotations .",
    "( b ) two @xmath5 rotations create two pairs of @xmath10-type anyons .",
    "if one anyon from each pair is positioned on the same plaquette then they annihilate , thereby connecting their strings .",
    "( c ) when a part of a string forms a loop around unpopulated plaquettes , the loop cancels ( dashed ) .",
    "( d ) here we restrict to one @xmath1 plaquette and four neighboring @xmath0 plaquettes .",
    "anyon @xmath9 is produced by a @xmath4 on qubit 1 ( blue ) , @xmath11 .",
    "this system can support the circulation of an @xmath10 around an @xmath9 anyon.[fig-1],title=\"fig : \" ]      starting from this ground state one can excite pairs of anyons connected by a string on the lattice using single qubit operations . more specifically , by applying @xmath4 on some qubit of the lattice a pair of so called @xmath9-type anyons is created on the two neighboring @xmath1 plaquettes [ ( a ) ] and the system is described by the state @xmath12 .",
    "an @xmath10 pair of anyons lives on the @xmath0 plaquettes and is obtained by a @xmath5 operation .",
    "the combination of both creates the composite quasiparticle @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "two equal pauli rotations applied on qubits of the same plaquette create two anyons on this plaquette . the fusion rules ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .",
    ", where @xmath18 is the vacuum state  @xcite ) describe the outcome from combining two anyons . in the above example ,",
    "if two anyons are created on the same plaquette then they annihilate .",
    "this operation also glues two single strings of the same type together to form a new string , again with a pair of anyons at its ends [ figure  [ fig-1](b ) ] . if the string forms a loop , the anyons at its end annihilate each other , thus removing the anyonic excitation . in case that",
    "only a part of the string forms a loop , the string gets truncated [ figure  [ fig-1](c ) ] . for non - compact finite systems , such as the one we consider here",
    ", a string may end up at the boundary describing a single anyon at its free endpoint .",
    "anyonic statistics is revealed as a non - trivial phase factor acquired by the wave function of the lattice system after braiding anyons , i.e. , after moving an @xmath10 anyon around an @xmath9 anyon [ figure  [ fig-1](d ) ] or vice versa .",
    "consider the initial state @xmath19 .",
    "if an anyon of type @xmath10 is assumed to be at a neighboring @xmath0 plaquette it can be moved around @xmath9 along the path generated by successive applications of @xmath5 rotations on the four qubits of the @xmath1 plaquette .",
    "the final state is @xmath20 such a minimal loop , which vanishes the moment it is closed , is analogous to the application of the respective interaction term @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) of the hamiltonian .",
    "this operator has eigenvalue @xmath23 for all plaquettes of the ground state @xmath8 , whereas it signals an excitation , e.g. , @xmath24 , with eigenvalue @xmath25 , when applied to the plaquette where an anyon resides .",
    "however , is much more general , as the actual path of the loop is irrelevant .",
    "it is the topological phase factor of @xmath25 , which reveals the presence of the enclosed anyon .",
    "alternatively , we can interpret as a description of twisting @xmath13 , the combination of an @xmath9 and an @xmath10-type anyon , by @xmath26 .",
    "the phase factor of @xmath25 thereby reveals its @xmath27-symmetry , characteristic for half spin , fermionic particles  @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) anyons exhibit bosonic statistics with respect to themselves  @xcite .",
    "as this two - dimensional system is well suited for demonstrating characteristic anyonic features , the question arises how big the lattice has to be .",
    "it turns out that four qubits of a single @xmath1 plaquette represent the minimal unit of the toric code model  @xcite . in this case , the four neighboring @xmath0 plaquettes are represented only by their corresponding links . hence , while the presence of an @xmath9 anyon is detected by the plaquette operator @xmath28 , the presence of @xmath10 anyons is detected by the eigenvalue of the four @xmath29 operators that correspond to the adjacent links of the @xmath0 plaquettes .",
    "consequently , the product determining the ground state [ eqn .",
    "( [ state ] ) ] reduces to only one factor for the single @xmath1-plaquette resulting in a four qubit ghz state , @xmath30 .",
    "this is an eigenstate of the relevant @xmath28 and @xmath31 operators with eigenvalue @xmath23 .",

    "the qubits supporting the anyonic states are encoded in the polarization of single photons propagating in well - defined spatial modes .",
    "this means that for the anyonic vacuum and for all obtained final states our system is of the form @xmath42 .",
    "the indices ( omitted in the following ) label the spatial mode of each photon , i.e. , they represent the position of the qubit as in figure  [ fig-1](d ) , and h ( v ) denote linear horizontal ( vertical ) polarization , representing a logical @xmath43 ( @xmath18 ) . to obtain such four - photon entangled states , the second order emission of a non - collinear type - ii spontaneous parametric down conversion process ( spdc ) @xcite , yielding four photons in two spatial modes ,",
    "is overlapped on a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and afterwards symmetrically split up into four spatial modes by two polarization independent beam splitters ( bs ) , see figure  [ fig-2](a ) @xcite .",
    "prior to the second order interference at the pbs the polarization of two of the photons is rotated by a half - wave plate ( hwp ) . under the condition of detecting one photon in each spatial mode we observe the desired states .",
    "as we are interested in the vacuum @xmath44 and the anyonic state @xmath45 , the successful simulation and demonstration of anyonic features relies on a careful distinction and characterization of these two orthogonal ghz states .",
    "this comprises the confirmation of genuine four - partite entanglement and a method to reveal the phase @xmath46 . for this purpose ,",
    "state analysis is performed by measuring the correlation , @xmath47 , in the @xmath41 basis for each qubit and the correlation function @xmath48 with @xmath49 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this measurement is ideally suited to prove the coherent superposition of the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 and to determine their relative phase @xmath46 .",
    "it is obtained from a measurement of all qubits along the same direction in the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane of the bloch sphere . for a ghz@xmath54 state",

    "we find a correlation of @xmath64 .",
    "the population of other terms is caused by noise arising from higher - order emissions of the down conversion and a remaining degree of distinguishability of photons at the pbs .",
    "the dependence of @xmath65 for the state @xmath8 is displayed in figure  [ fig-3](a ) from which we infer a visibility @xmath56 of @xmath66 .",
    "this value is obtained from a weighted least squares fit to a fourier decomposition of @xmath65 considering only even components up to order 4 : @xmath67 .",
    "only these components can originate from physical states . from the phase of the correlation function we deduce the phase of the ghz@xmath68 state to be @xmath69 , close to the expected value of @xmath43 .",
    "the visibility @xmath56 together with the populations @xmath70 and @xmath71 allow further to determine the fidelity @xmath72 .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath73 ( for measurement data see also table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the fidelity is not only important for an estimation of state quality but can also be applied to verify genuine four - partite entanglement , an essential element in the presented toric code model . with a proper entanglement witness",
    "a fidelity greater than 50% is sufficient  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed fidelity is clearly above this bound , i.e. , it is of high enough quality to allow for the demonstration of the anyonic properties .",
    "we start by analyzing the state change under the creation ( and annihilation ) of anyons , thereby demonstrating the characteristic fusion rules . applying @xmath74 in mode",
    "@xmath18 creates an @xmath9-type anyon on the @xmath1 plaquette resulting in a ghz@xmath75 state , figure  [ fig-3](b ) .",
    "this is clearly proven by the phase @xmath76 of the correlation function .",
    "a further application of @xmath77 on any other mode , say @xmath78 , changes the state of the plaquette according to @xmath79 , and the anyon is moved away from the @xmath1 plaquette under investigation .",
    "these two @xmath4 rotations represent a string connecting two anyons , which traverses the particular plaquette without influencing its state , as confirmed by the observation of the initial ghz@xmath68 state [ @xmath80 , figure  [ fig-3](c ) ] . a further @xmath77 rotation on one of the remaining vertices , e.g. , @xmath81 , creates an @xmath9 occupation on the plaquette .",
    "thus , the observation of ghz@xmath82 [ @xmath83 , figure  [ fig-3](d ) ] demonstrates the non - trivial version of the @xmath84 fusion rule .",
    "alternatively , this can be seen as demonstrating the invariance of an anyonic state , when a string traverses the plaquette .    .",
    "the phase of @xmath85 directly gives the phase @xmath46 of @xmath86 .",
    "( a ) the vacuum state , @xmath8 .",
    "( b ) generating an @xmath9-type anyonic state @xmath87 by a @xmath4 operator .",
    "( c ) a second @xmath4 removes the anyon from the plaquette and elongates the string resulting in the ghz@xmath68 state .",
    "( d ) a third @xmath4 creates another pair of anyons , connected with the string already traversing the plaquette .",
    "( e ) moving an @xmath10 anyon around an empty @xmath1 plaquette or ( f ) first creating an @xmath9 anyon on the plaquette ( i ) , performing the loop ( ii ) , and removing the @xmath9 anyon from the plaquette again ( iii ) give identical final states up to a global phase factor .",
    "( g ) the global phase , @xmath88 , is revealed by superimposing the two above evolutions , thereby clearly proving anyonic statistics .",
    "( h ) an alternative path for the anyon @xmath9 that gives the same fractional statistical phase , @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig-3],title=\"fig : \" ]    to detect the major feature of anyons , their non - trivial statistical phase acquired when moving one anyon around the other , we employed an interference measurement , which makes their _ overall _ phase factor visible [ see and figure  [ fig-1](d ) ] .",
    "let us study the two evolutions separately .",
    "the first is to create a pair of two @xmath10 anyons , move one of them around the empty @xmath1 plaquette and then annihilate them .",
    "this evolution is equivalent to having a string ending up at a @xmath0 plaquette with an @xmath10 anyon at its endpoint and circulating that anyon around the @xmath1 plaquette .",
    "the obtained loop operator @xmath28 , obviously , does not change the vacuum state and , thus , results in ghz@xmath68 [ @xmath89 , figure  [ fig-3](e ) ] .",
    "alternatively , we ( i ) create an @xmath9 anyon on the plaquette , ( ii ) encompass it with the loop of an @xmath10 anyon , and ( iii ) remove it again [ figure  [ fig-3](f ) ] .",
    "the whole evolution is , in analogy to , described by @xmath90 [ figure  [ fig-3](f ) ] , but is blind to the characteristic overall phase factor .",
    "this , finally , can be observed by ( i ) first generating the _ superposition _ @xmath91 of having an anyon @xmath9 on the plaquette or not by the unitary operation @xmath92 ; ( ii ) moving the @xmath10 anyon around this superposition gives @xmath93 , the superposition of the above evolutions ; and ( iii ) the application of the inverse rotation @xmath94 makes the phase difference visible resulting in @xmath95 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath96 [ figure  [ fig-3](g ) ] clearly proves the phase acquired by the braiding and therefore the anyonic statistics  @xcite . to reinforce the observation of the obtained fractional phase , we perform an additional interference experiment with an alternative path .",
    "now , the superposition of an @xmath9 anyonic state and the ground state is generated in the @xmath1-plaquette by rotating one qubit and it is removed by rotating another qubit , as seen in  figure  [ fig-3](h ) .",
