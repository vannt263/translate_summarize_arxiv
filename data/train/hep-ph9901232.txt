    "<S> we calculate the leading nonperturbative contributions to the effective wilson coefficient of the four - fermion operators arising from the qcd penguin , and we demonstrate how the usual perturbative one loop contribution is augmented by nonperturbative condensates . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections , which are obtained by quark and gluon condensate insertions into the quark loops , enter at the next - to - leading logarithm precision . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate for the charmed quark loop that the gluon condensate contribution is quite sensitive to the momentum transfer to the quark - antiquark pair .    /#1    </S>",
    "<S> nonleptonic b decays to light hadrons have recently received a lot of theoretical attention . </S>",
    "<S> this is mostly due to the measurements by the cleo collaboration of a number of @xmath0 decays , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are light hadrons such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the larger than expected experimental results for the branching ratio of the inclusive @xmath7 and its exclusive counterpart @xmath8 have led to various theoretical explanations both within and beyond the standard model@xcite . on the other hand , these decays could provide the first evidence for cp violation in b decays in the near future@xcite .    the standard theoretical framework to study the nonleptonic @xmath9 decays </S>",
    "<S> is based on the effective hamiltonian approach . in this way , the heavy degrees of freedom , i.e. top quark and @xmath10 gauge bosons , are integrated out and the matrix element can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the complete set of operators relevant to @xmath0 decay and @xmath13 are the corresponding wilson coefficients evaluated at the renormalization scale @xmath14@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients have been calculated up to the next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) precision in the strong coupling constant @xmath15 @xcite . at this precision , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements on the rhs of that equation should be evaluated at the one loop level in order to have a renormalization - scheme independent result for the lhs of the eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) should also be added to the above list .    in nll precision , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element of the operators is to be evaluated at one loop level , as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> these one loop matrix elements in turn can be written in terms of tree level matrix elements with loop effects included in the corresponding effective wilson coefficients @xmath31@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of relevant one loop diagrams , the vertex corrections , where a gluon connects two of the outgoing quark lines , and penguin diagrams where a quark - antiquark pair forms a loop and emits a gluon which in turn produces a quark - antiquark pair . </S>",
    "<S> our focus in this paper is on the latter type of corrections ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) since they could have a potentially significant effect on branching ratios and cp asymmetry in two body hadronic @xmath9 decays@xcite . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , the absorptive portion of penguin diagrams can provide the strong phase necessary for direct cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> this one loop correction is analogous to the so - called continuum contribution in the dileptonic rare @xmath9 decays @xmath32 , where one has to deal with a lepton - antilepton pair , as opposed to a quark - antiquark pair @xcite . for the dilepton case </S>",
    "<S> , we also have significant nonperturbative contributions from intermediate vector mesons which are quite sensitive to the momentum - transfer to the dileptons . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the above analogy , we embark on supplementing @xmath31 with a corresponding set of nonperturbative contributions .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the leading nonperturbative corrections to the perturbative evaluation of the penguin diagrams . ignoring the vertex corrections , </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , one can not have a complete picture of the nll corrections without taking into account nonperturbative effects which , as in the case of the intermediate resonance contribution to @xmath32 , can prove to be significant . to investigate this possibility , we calculate the leading nonperturbative contributions to @xmath45 by inserting quark and gluon condensates , which are believed to be responsible for the chiral - symmetry breaking and confinement properties , respectively , of the qcd vacuum , into one - loop penguin diagrams ( figs . 2,3 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are light mesons , the characteristic range of @xmath40 is argued to be@xcite @xmath73 for light quarks @xmath74 , the nonperturbative terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 21 ) can be approximated by @xmath75 inserting the phenomenological values @xmath76 gev@xmath77 and @xmath78 gev@xmath79 , we observe that the leading nonperturbative corrections are around three orders of magnitude smaller than the perturbative contribution , and can therefore be safely neglected .    for the heavier charmed quark , </S>",
    "<S> however , the situation is more interesting because of the presence of a singularity at @xmath80 in the gluon - condensate term : the range @xmath81 suggested by ( 22 ) is quite likely inclusive of @xmath82 , ( i.e. , of @xmath83 ) given the present 1.1 - 1.4 gev range of values for @xmath84@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there is a genuine possibility that the gluon - condensate contribution to the penguin amplitude could be comparable to the purely perturbative correction , depending on which value of @xmath40 one chooses . </S>",
    "<S> this sensitivity to the momentum transfer @xmath40 is also important for investigating direct cp asymmetry in hadronic b decays , as the gluon - condensate contribution to ( 21 ) develops an imaginary part which dominates the strong phase of the effective wilson coefficients as @xmath85 from above .    for a physical interpretation of the above results </S>",
    "<S> , we again use the analogy with the dileptonic b decays @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> these decay modes receive a perturbative charmed - quark loop correction ( continuum contribution ) as well as nonperturbative contributions when @xmath87 forms intermediate resonances such as @xmath88 , @xmath89, ... @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be incorporated by modelling a breit - wigner form for the resonance propagator in the long distance amplitude@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the momentum transfer to dileptons , and where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the mass and total decay width of the intermediate resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dileptonic differential decay rate has peaks at @xmath94 , and the nonperturbative resonance contribution indeed dominates the branching ratio of this mode .    </S>",
    "<S> one can make a similar charmonium - resonance interpretation for the singularity at @xmath95 in the @xmath69 contribution to the effective wilson coefficients of the condensate - augmented penguin amplitude , particularily if we identify the @xmath96 kinematic threshold for the imaginary part with the onset of a `` physical '' intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted , however , that such a resonance couples directly to a single gluon ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) , necessarily implying that the @xmath82 singularity , _ if indeed a resonance _ , must be associated with the leading contribution of a weakly bound _ </S>",
    "<S> colour - octet _ @xmath97 state@xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the nonperturbative quark and gluon condensate contributions to the effective wilson coefficients of the qcd penguin four - fermion operators , supplementing the one loop ( continuum ) @xmath98 correction which appears at nll precision with its nonperturbative counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out how incorporation of the gluon condensate in the charmed quark loop results in a contribution which is highly sensitive to momentum transfer @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath40 is not in - and - of itself a physical observable in two body hadronic b decays , one can not exclude the possibility of significant nonperturbative contributions to both the magnitude _ and _ the strong phase of the effective wilson coefficients of the four - fermi operators @xmath99 . </S>"
