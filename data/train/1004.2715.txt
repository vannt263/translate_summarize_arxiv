    "absorption systems with @xmath6 log  @xmath7 17 and within @xmath8 5000  of a background qso are often considered to be ` associated ' with the quasar host galaxy , its immediate environment or its ejecta .",
    "evidence for this conclusion comes from time variability of the absorption ( hamann et al . 1997a ; wise et al . 2004 ; lundgren et al . 2007 ) , partial coverage of the emission source ( hamann et al .",
    "1997b , c ; fox et al .",
    "2008 ) , elevated incidence of highly ionized species ( e.g. ganguly et al . 2001",
    "; richards 2001 ; fechner & richter 2009 ) , possible dependence of absorber incidence on qso properties such as radio loudness or orientation ( mller & jakobsen 1987 ; richards et al . 2001 ; baker et al .",
    "2002 ; vestergaard 2003 ; wild et al .",
    "2008 ) and solar or super - solar metallicities ( e.g. petitjean , rauch & carswell 1994 ; hamann et al . 1997a ; srianand & petitjean 2000 ; dodorico et al . 2004 ; fechner & richter 2009 ) . the associated population of absorbers appears to extend out to at least 10,000  ( petitjean et al .",
    "1994 ; richards et al . 1999 ; wild et al . 2008 ; tytler et al . 2009 ) .",
    "although the @xmath9  forest , civ , mgii and lyman limit systems have been well - researched in the last 20 years , the same is not true of the proximate damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) .",
    "this is partly a historical bias .",
    "dlas are excellent tools for characterising the high redshift galaxy population . knowing that associated systems may be connected with the qso or its host galaxy , statistical samples of dlas have therefore excluded these potentially special systems ( e.g. wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ; ellison et al .",
    "2001 ; prochaska , herbert - fort & wolfe 2005 ; jorgenson et al . 2006 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "furthermore , the chemical abundances of intervening dlas can be determined fairly easily because their gas is predominantly neutral .",
    "proximity to a qso could invalidate that assumption and lead to erroneous abundance determinations , unless photoionization modelling is used .",
    "however , it is for exactly these reasons that the study of proximate dlas ( pdlas ) is interesting .",
    "pdlas provide a potential probe of galaxies clustered around ( or associated with ) qsos , and even provide insight into the interplay between ionizing radiation and the ism .",
    "one of the difficulties in studying the proximate dlas is the small redshift path for each line of sight , which means that pdlas are very rare .",
    "for example , assuming the same number density as intervening systems at @xmath10 , @xmath8 100 qsos would need to be surveyed to find just one pdla .",
    "a second challenge is constructing a sample of pdlas selected with a homogeneous qso - absorber velocity offset ( @xmath5 ) criterion .",
    "since the derived emission redshift of a qso depends critically on the emission lines used ( e.g. gaskell 1982 ; tytler & fan 1992 ) , the value can be uncertain by over 1000  ( @xmath8 3 mpc proper at @xmath11 ) .",
    "the first systematic study of pdlas was conducted with the complete optical and radio absorption line system ( corals ) survey data by ellison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who found a factor of 4 excess in the number density of pdlas in their radio - selected sample .",
    "russell , ellison & benn ( 2006 ) extended this work to identify 33 pdlas in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 3 ( dr3 ) and confirmed the pdla excess , independent of radio loudness , at 3.5@xmath12 significance . in the largest pdla survey conducted so far , prochaska , hennawi & herbert - fort ( 2008 )",
    "use the sdss dr5 to identify 108 pdlas with @xmath13 3000 .",
    "in addition to its larger size , this work re - calculated the qso redshifts in order to obtain improved estimates of @xmath5 .",
    "prochaska et al .",
    "( 2008b ) found that pdlas outnumber the intervening dlas at @xmath14 by a factor of 2 , but found no statistically significant excess at @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "in addition to the pdla number density , prochaska et al .",
    "( 2008b ) investigated whether their  column density distribution function differed from the intervening dlas .",
    "they found marginal evidence for an excess of high  pdlas .",
    "previously , tytler ( 1982 ) had found no excess for the slightly lower  lyman limit systems but with a much larger sample prochaska , omeara & worseck ( 2010 ) find a deficit .",
    "apart from their incidence and  distribution , few studies of pdlas exist to assess whether or not they are consistent with the intervening population . in particular",
    ", pdlas are rarely targetted for echelle spectroscopy , so little is known about their chemical enrichment .",
    "nonetheless , a small number of pdlas have appeared in chemical abundance studies ( see table [ lit_z_table ] for those that meet our criteria ) and they do not appear to have strikingly different properties to the intervening dlas ( lu et al . 1996 ; akerman et al . 2005 ; rix et al .",
    "the range of metallicities , @xmath17 element enhancements and dust depletions are all consistent with the range seen amongst intervening dlas .",
    "rix et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also found negligible ionization corrections were necessary for the pdla in their study , as is usually the case for other dlas .",
    "it has therefore usually been concluded that the pdlas do not constitute a distinct population from the intervening systems ( e.g. mller et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in this work , we present echelle spectra for seven pdlas ( section [ obs_sec ] ) , determine improved emission redshifts ( section [ z_sec ] ) and measure column densities for a range of metal line species ( section [ coldens_sec ] ) .",
    "we supplement our sample with other pdlas critically selected from the literature to form a sample of 16 proximate absorbers ( section [ lit_sec ] ) .",
    "ionization properties and metal abundances of pdlas are compared to the intervening systems in sections [ ion_sec ] and [ abund_sec ] . finally , we use measurements of cii@xmath4 and upper limits to siii@xmath4 to constrain the distance between the pdla and the background qso ( section [ dist_sec ] ) .    unless otherwise stated , we assume @xmath18 , @xmath19 and h@xmath20 = 70  mpc@xmath21 .",
    "proximate dlas for this study were mostly selected from the sdss dr5 catalogue of prochaska , hennawi & herbert - fort ( 2008 ) . these are j014049.18@xmath22083942.5 , j014214.74 + 002324.3 , j113130 + 604420 , j124020.9 + 145535.6 , j160413.9 + 395121.9 and j232115.48 + 142131.5 . for simplicity",
    "we hereafter refer to these qsos by their sdss names in the form jhhmm+ddmm .",
    "one additional non - sdss qso is also in the sample : q0151 + 048 ( um144 ) .",
    "sdss magnitudes are given in table [ obs_table ] for all qsos except q0151 + 048 where we have taken the r - band magnitude from the apmapmcat ] plate measurements .",
    "our target selection was based on relatively bright qsos with absorbers whose velocity offset was found to be @xmath23  by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , and with positions accessible during our scheduled observing runs .",
    "the @xmath5 cut - off is somewhat arbitrary and it should be stressed that it is unlikely that these velocities correspond to distances inferred from the hubble expansion ( d = v / h(z ) ) if the proximate absorbers are linked either to the host galaxy or associated with its gravitational potential . in the former case , the velocities may reflect outflows or internal motions . in the latter scenario ,",
    "the @xmath5 distribution would be indicative of peculiar motions .",
    "we provide empirical evidence that the value of @xmath5 does not correspond to a hubble distance by showing that a number of the pdlas have negative velocities relative to the qso ( section [ z_sec ] ) and that elemental trends do not correlate with @xmath5 ( section [ ion_sec ] ) .",
    "observations were obtained with either the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) or with the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) on the keck telescope .",
    "uves is a dual - arm echelle spectrograph with a grating cross disperser .",
    "there are four different cross dispersers available and two dichroics ( dic1 and dic2 ) , which split the incident beam between the blue and red arms .",
    "the central wavelengths are governed by the grating angles and are adjusted to allow the desired spectral coverage to fall on the 3 ccds ( one in the blue arm and two in the red ) .",
    "we combined two of uves s ` standard ' settings ( dic1 346 + 580 and dic2 437 + 860 ) in order to obtain spectral coverage over approximately 3050  9700  .",
    "integration times are given in table [ obs_table ] .",
    "observations of a thar lamp for wavelength calibration followed each exposure . the ccds were binned 2x2 and a 1 arcsecond slit was used , resulting in nominal resolutions of r=41,000 and 39,000 in the blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "we observed j0140@xmath220839 , j0142 + 0023 and j2321 + 1421 on the nights of 2007 october 2 - 3 with uves in visitor mode .",
    "the seeing ranged between 0.6 and 1.0 arcsec .",
    "the spectra were extracted and reduced using the uves pipeline .",
    "the extracted spectra from each exposure were converted to a common vacuum - heliocentric wavelength scale . where multiple exposures in a given setting were obtained , or where there is spectral overlap between settings , the data were combined , weighting by the inverse of the flux variances . table [",
    "obs_table ] lists the typical s / n ratios for each target in the final combined spectrum ( where there is some wavelength overlap between settings ) .",
    "the spectrum was normalized by fitting a smooth continuum through unabsorbed parts of the data using the starlink dipso package .",
    "j1240 + 1455 and j1604 + 3951 were observed with the keck / hires spectrometer ( vogt 1994 ) using the upgraded ccd mosaic on 2007 april 2728 .",
    "j1131 + 6044 and q0151 + 048 were also observed with hires on 2006 december 25 and 2006 august 17 respectively .",
    "the first two quasars , which have pdlas at @xmath24 , were observed using the blue cross - disperser ( hiresb ) with wavelength coverage from roughly the atmospheric cutoff to @xmath25 .",
    "the latter two were observed using the red cross - disperser ( hiresr ) with the kv418 blocking filter giving an effective wavelength coverage of 43008700 .",
    "the echelle and cross disperser angles are given in table [ obs_table ] , along with total exposure times .",
    "all of the observations were acquired through the c1 decker which affords a full width at half maximum ( fwhm )  @xmath26 spectral resolution .",
    "the data were reduced with the hiredux pipeline that is available within the xidl software packagexavier / idl ] .",
    "one significant difference in the analysis of the hires data , compared to the uves reductions , is the stage at which the the continuum is fitted . whereas the uves data are normalized as the final reduction step once",
    "the echelle orders have been combined into one dimension , the xidl reduction pipeline fits a local continuum to each order before the 2-dimensional spectra are combined into 1d .",
    "the advantage of this latter approach is that the construction of the 1-dimensional spectrum is simplified , e.g. by removing the effects of the blaze .",
    "the disadvantage is that since damped  troughs extend over multiple orders , hires spectra do not lend themselves easily to  fitting .",
    "we discuss this further below .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the question that underpins the research of all associated absorbers is whether they are intrinsic to the qso ( host or outflow ) or simply nearby in velocity space .",
    "mller et al . (",
    "1998 ) examined a number of hypotheses for the nature of the pdlas and favour a model in which the pdlas are similar in nature to the intervening absorbers , but possibly located in a preferential environment , such as in the same overdensity as the qso .",
    "rix et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that the pdla towards q2343@xmath22bx415 ( included in our literature sample ) may be associated with outflowing material from the quasar host .",
    "indirect clues to the provenance of the pdlas may be garnered from their statistical properties .",
    "an excess of pdlas relative to intervening systems has been confirmed by three studies ( ellison et al .",
    "2002 ; russell et al .",
    "2006 ; prochaska et al 2008b ) .",
    "although ellison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found an additional excess of pdlas in their radio - selected sample relative to optically selected qsos , russell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found an equal pdla enhancement towards radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to the limited statistics of the ellison et al .",
    "study , but a second possibility is the nature of radio sources .",
    "the corals sample used by ellison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is comprised entirely of ( rarer ) flat - spectrum quasars that have compact morphologies .",
    "the sources detected at 20-cm in the russell et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample will have a range of spectral indices and orientations .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the dependence of pdla incidence as a function of radio spectral index , as has been done extensively for civ absorbers .",
    "there is certainly evidence that the quasar s radiation affects the ability of a pdla to survive .",
    "hennawi & prochaska ( 2007 ) have shown that the incidence of transverse dlas in projected qso pairs over - predicts the incidence of proximate absorbers by a factor of 4  20 .",
    "these authors suggested that line - of - sight pdlas are preferentially photo - evaporated by the qso s beamed radiation .",
    "a similar overabundance of transverse mgii absorbers relative to the line of sight has been seen by bowen et al .",
    "moreover , prochaska et al .",
    "( 2008b ) show that despite the higher incidence of pdlas relative to the intervening population , a clustering analysis indicates that they are nonetheless underabundant relative to the expected number density of galaxies near qsos .",
    "one of the observations that supports an intrinsic origin for many associated absorbers , is their solar or super - solar metallicity ( see the introduction ) .",
    "we do not find any evidence for such elevated metallicities in our sample of pdlas .",
    "the same is true of the associated mgii systems ( some of which may be dlas ) studied by vanden berk et al .",
    "nonetheless , as discussed above , we do find that pdlas with high hi column densities have a mean metallicity that is higher than intervening systems by around a factor of three .",
    "for example , [ s / h]=@xmath27 for the proximate absorbers versus @xmath28 for those at @xmath29 .",
    "the correlation between stellar mass and gas - phase metallicity that exists out to redshifts of at least 3 ( tremonti et al . 2004 ; savaglio et al . 2005 ; erb et al .",
    "2006 ; maiolino et al 2008 ) indicates that the pdlas might therefore also be relatively massive .",
    "qsos themselves are highly biased tracers of mass and are often located in or near galaxy clusters or other overdensities , although they apparently eschew the centres of clusters ( sanchez & gonzalez - serrano 1999 ; barr et al . 2003 ; sochting , clowes & campusano 2004 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2004 ; lietzen et al .",
    "2009 ; hutchings , scholz and bianchi 2009 ) . since the typical stellar mass of a galaxy tends to increase with the galaxy density of its local environment ( e.g. baldry et al .",
    "2006 ) , the combination of clustering and the mass - metallicity relation may explain the higher metallicities of pdlas .",
    "further evidence for this scenario comes from the discovery of a likely companion qso to j1131 + 6044 , and with the previously known companions of q0151 + 048 and q2343@xmath22bx415 ( mller et al . 1998 ; rix et al .",
    "boris et al . ( 2007 ) find evidence that 3/4 of the qso binaries in their sample are associated with rich clusters at @xmath30 .",
    "other evidence for absorbers clustered around qsos comes from the incidence of transverse absorbers . in their study of close",
    "projected pairs ( in which it is argued that transverse absorbers suffer less photo - evaporation than line of sight absorbers ) hennawi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find a 50% covering fraction of sub - dlas within 150 kpc .",
    "it may seem suprising that absorbers with velocity offsets of up to 3000  could be considered associated with the qso environment when this velocity corresponds to a hubble flow distance of @xmath8 10 mpc ( proper ) at @xmath14 .",
    "however , the velocity offsets are unlikely to indicate hubble flow distances , as clearly demonstrated by the existence of absorbers with very negative velocities .",
    "although we have additionally highlighted the uncertainty in the emission redshifts , these are unlikely to be incorrect by the @xmath3 1500 required to make all of our absorber offsets positive .",
    "we have discussed above some of the observations that have shown that qsos often occupy overdense regions , a statement that might lead us to imagine cluster - like structures today with sizes of a few mpc . however , lietzen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have argued that qsos can also trace out other overdense structures , such as filaments whose dimensions can be tens of mpc .",
    "haines et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have found evidence for an extreme structure of galaxies clustered around quasars on scales of tens of mpc at @xmath30 .",
    "the pdlas appear to share some characteristics in common with absorbers associated with gamma - ray burst ( grb ) hosts .",
    "the grb dlas have higher metallicities and are skewed to higher  than intervening qso dlas ( e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "higher [ @xmath17/fe ] are also found in the grb dlas , similar to some of the pdlas in our sample . however , the difference between the grb dlas and intervening systems is often attributed to the grb sightlines preferentially intersecting the galaxy at smaller galactocentric radii , rather than a fundamental difference in the populations probed by the grbs and qsos .    regardless of their origin , if the metallicities of ( at least the high )",
    "proximate dlas are relatively high , as a population they present an interesting new selection technique for identifying the most metal - rich galaxies at high redshift . with metallicities ranging from 1/3 to 1/10 of the solar value , the high  pdlas have metallicities similar to the ` metal strong dlas ' ( msdlas , herbert - fort et al .",
    "2006 ) at @xmath31 ( kaplan et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "indeed , a number of the msdlas are also pdlas ( kaplan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "although this is still more metal - poor than the majority of lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) studied at this redshift , most lbg abundances are limited to fairly massive galaxies ( erb et al .",
    "gravitational lensing permits studies of fainter galaxies .",
    "only a handful of such objects have been studied so far , but the results indicate that galaxies with @xmath32 luminosities at @xmath31 to 3 have metallicities of @xmath33 ( e.g. teplitz et al . 2000 ; pettini et al . 2002 ; quider et al .",
    "2009a , b ) .",
    "if the pdlas follow a similar mass - metallicity relation , then they may be only slightly less massive than these lensed lbgs .",
    "high metallicity systems present a number of interesting possibilities for studying the high redshift ism . for example , noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that molecular hydrogen is highly dependent on metallicity .",
    "high metallicities also present the opportunity to detect and study the abundances of rarely detected elements such as ge , b , cl and co ( ellison , ryan & prochaska 2001 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2003c ) .",
    "hennawi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented a sample of close , projected qso pairs where the background quasar exhibits optically thick  absorption at the redshift of the foreground quasar .",
    "it is shown that 50% of projected qso pairs have an absorber with log  @xmath319 at the redshift of the foreground qso when the separation is @xmath7 150 kpc .",
    "this much higher incidence of transverse absorbers , relative to proximate line of sight absorbers , is suggested by hennawi & prochaska ( 2007 ) to be due to differential photo - evaporation by anisotropic radiation of the foreground qso . in the future , it will be interesting to compare the chemical abundances and ionization indicators of pdlas to transverse dlas at a given  ( e.g. prochaska & hennawi 2009 ) and to test fine structure distance estimates against the measurable transverse separations . despite their external provenance , the qso s radiation can apparently affect pdlas out to at least 2500 from the qso . with a larger sample , and accurate redshifts , it will also be possible to look for trends with velocity .",
    "ultimately , this may require the incorporation of other parameters such as qso luminosity , including radiation from nearby companions .",
    "a campaign is currently underway to obtain ir spectra for a sample of qsos with pdlas ( including those presented in this paper ) that will yield redshifts accurate to @xmath8 40  from the [ oiii ] @xmath34 5007 line .",
    "it is worth noting that only a few tens of @xmath35 qsos have redshifts [ oiii ] @xmath34 5007 redshifts ( e.g. scott et al .",
    "2000 ) . for objects in the hubble flow , velocities correspond to distances . for positive values of @xmath5",
    "we can not distinguish between these expansion velocities and peculiar motions ( as expected if the galaxies and qsos are in the same gravitational potential .",
    "however , negative @xmath5 can not be due to hubble expansion , since it would imply the absorber is more distant than the qso , which is clearly impossible .",
    "the negative side of the velocity distribution of pdlas therefore yields the ` true ' velocity distribution of the pdlas around the qso , without contamination from the hubble flow .",
    "larger samples will also allow us to study trends of the combined effect of @xmath5 and qso luminosity .",
    "we have presented new high resolution echelle spectra for seven proximate damped lyman alpha systems with @xmath36 .",
    "the metal column densities derived from voigt profile fits and the apparent optical depth method are complemented with abundances for a further 9 pdlas taken from the literature .",
    "our pdla sample is compared to the most complete sample of intervening dlas currently available .",
    "our principal conclusions are :    1 .",
    "pdlas exhibit a range of metallicities at a given redshift , ranging from @xmath8 1/3 to 1/1000 of the solar value ( section [ metal_sec ] and figure [ fe_si_z ] ) .",
    "one of the pdlas in our sample exhibits the lowest n(siii)/n(hi ) of any known dla and has a value similiar to the intergalactic medium at this redshift .",
    "2 .   based on this modest - sized sample , there is a general trend ( with the exception of one fairly high velocity pdla ) for low metallicities ( @xmath37 ) in pdlas with log @xmath7 21 and higher metallicities ( @xmath38 ) when the hi column density is higher ( figure [ fe_si_s_zn_hi ] ) . at these high column densities ,",
    "the metallicities of pdlas are systematically higher than the intervening sample by a factor of around three .",
    "at least half of the pdlas with  @xmath7 20.8 have sub - solar ratios of [ s / si ] which can not be easily explained by known dust or nucleosynthetic trends ( section [ ion_alpha ] and figure [ s_si_hi ] ) .",
    "we interpret the low values as resulting from ionization by a hard spectrum .",
    "sub - solar values of [ s / si ] can be present even in pdlas with @xmath5 @xmath3 2000 , and with no obvious trend with velocity .",
    "in addition to the dependence of metallicity on  and the sub - solar [ s / si ] ratios , other indications of enhanced / hard ionization in the pdlas which distinguish them from the intervening dlas are : 1 ) a possibly higher fraction of nv absorbers ( tentative based on the small number statistics of our sample ) , 2 ) higher fractions of siiv / siii at low , 3 ) similar velocity structure in siiv as siii in 3/5 qsos where the comparison can be made , 4 ) low ratios of [ ar / si ] ( section [ ion_sec ] ) . 5 .",
    "most of the pdlas ( 6/7 ) in our sample of seven have additional high ionization gas at large negative velocities of @xmath39 to @xmath40  ( section [ disc_high ] and table [ high_ion_tab ] ) .",
    "the most extreme examples both have either a confirmed ( q0151 + 048 ) or tentative ( j1131 + 6044 ) close companion qso .",
    "one of the pdlas in our sample has very sub - solar [ fe / zn ] consistent with a large dust depletion fraction .",
    "however , in general , the [ fe / zn ] ratios of the pdlas are consistent with the intervening population ( section [ dust_sec ] and figure [ zn_fe ] ) .",
    "the pdla towards j1604 + 3951 has very different depletion in its two main components .",
    "the range of alpha - to - iron ratios in the pdlas is also consistent with the intervening dlas , although there are a few notably high values ( section [ alpha_sec ] and figure [ si_fe_hi ] ) . 8 .   from analyses of the fine structure lines of siii and cii , qso  absorber distances",
    "at least a few tens of kpc are determined , with one case being constrained to have a separation of @xmath3 160 kpc ( section [ dist_sec ] ) .",
    "we conclude that pdla properties are generally consistent with an origin external to the qso host ( in contrast with , e.g. the narrow line associated systems , dodorico et al .",
    "however , the larger abundances ( at least of high  pdlas ) imply that they may not be representative of the intervening sample .",
    "we suggest that the pdlas may preferentially sample overdense environments where biased galaxy formation has assembled more massive galaxies with higher metallicities .",
    "indeed , at low redshift , some associated absorbers have been identified with small clusters of galaxies ( e.g. bergeron & boisse 1986 ; hamann et al .",
    "if confirmed with larger larger samples , this means that pdlas could be used as probes of massive galaxies at high redshift .",
    "pdlas have been widely excluded from most dla surveys .",
    "the results presented here indicate that , depending on the science objective , this is a valid approach .",
    "we have argued that pdlas may sample a rather special population of dlas , possibly those in proto - clusters .",
    "although this renders the pdlas an interesting probe of high redshift galaxies , our results reveal some of the biases that could be introduced into statistical surveys that do not impose a @xmath5 limit in their dla selection",
    ". a high priority for future work will be the improvement of emission redshift determinations .",
    "the results presented here imply that even at fairly large relative velocities ionization may affect abundance determinations .",
    "determining more accurate @xmath5 values in larger pdla samples will provide an empirically motivated cut - off for studies of intervening dlas .",

    "<S> taken at face value , the sample of 16 pdlas exhibits a wide range of metallicities , ranging from @xmath1 down to @xmath2 , including the dla with the lowest n(siii)/n(hi ) yet reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> however , some of these abundances may require ionization corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we find several pieces of evidence that indicate enhanced ionization and the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum in pdlas which lead to properties that contrast with the intervening dlas , particularly when the  is low . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances of zn , si and s in pdlas with log  @xmath3 21 , where ionization corrections are minimized , are systematically higher than the intervening population by a factor of around 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find possible evidence for a higher fraction of nv absorbers amongst the pdlas , although the statistics are still modest . </S>",
    "<S> 6/7 of our echelle sample show high ionization species ( siiv , civ , ovi or nv ) offset by @xmath3100  from the main low ion absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse fine - structure transitions of cii@xmath4 and siii@xmath4 to constrain the pdla distance from the qso . </S>",
    "<S> lower limits range from tens of kpc up to @xmath3160 kpc for the most stringent limit . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that ( at least some ) pdlas do exhibit different characteristics relative to the intervening population out to 3000  ( and possibly beyond ) . nonetheless , the pdlas appear distinct from lower column density associated systems and the inferred qso - absorber separations mean they are unlikely to be associated with the qso host . </S>",
    "<S> no trends with @xmath5 are found , although this requires a larger sample with better emission redshifts to confirm . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the pdlas preferentially sample more massive galaxies in more highly clustered regions of the high redshift universe . </S>"
