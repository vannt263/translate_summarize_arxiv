    "transport measurements in the normal fermi liquid ( spin,@xcite thermal conductivity,@xcite and viscosity@xcite ) reveal a crossover from an intrinsic inelastic quasiparticle - quasiparticle ( qp - qp ) scattering rate at high temperatures , to a quasiparticle - impurity dominated relaxation mechanism at a lower temperature .    in the @xmath1he - aerogel composite system ,",
    "the @xmath1he is always on the order of the zero - temperature coherence length away from the aerogel strands .",
    "the zero - temperature coherence length is defined to be @xmath6 .",
    "it is expected that the superfluid order parameter is suppressed and surface bound states exist near macroscopic surfaces and domain walls.@xcite however , the aerogel strands do not act as conventional surfaces  else",
    "superfluidity would be entirely suppressed in the @xmath1he - aerogel system .",
    "instead , scattering from the aerogel leads to a suppression of the superfluid gap .",
    "we expect a spectrum of low energy excitations inside the gap to appear , which could lead to a gapless superfluid state in which the density of states is finite around the entire fermi surface .",
    "@xcite evidence for such states exists in thermal conductivity@xcite and heat capacity@xcite measurements as @xmath7 , but the exact profile for the density of states of the @xmath1he in aerogel system and its dependence on strong coupling effects is still not fully understood .    in order to probe the dynamics of the aerogel embedded fluid , we employ a torsion pendulum technique .",
    "we track the frequency and quality factor ( @xmath8 ) of the pendulum with temperature . observing the frequency shift",
    "has proved instrumental in studying the effects of disorder at the onset of superfluid transition.@xcite however , due to the close spacing between the aerogel strands ( of the order of @xmath9 nm ) , even the small impurity limited viscosity of the normal state @xmath1he would be sufficient to clamp the fluid at the audio frequencies ( 2.1 khz ) corresponding to the driven antisymmetric torsional mode we employ . in order to probe the transport properties , we can not rely only on the frequency shift data . instead , in this article we focus on the energy dissipation factor ( @xmath0 ) of the pendulum , which should also be sensitive to the fermi surface excitations discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the aerogel sample is deliberately compressed along the pendulum axis by 10% .",
    "it has been generally accepted that the aerogel anisotropy due to the axial compression should favor the anisotropic , equal spin pairing ( esp ) superfluid @xmath1he - a phase.@xcite it had also been expected that the @xmath10 vector would tend to align along the axis of compression , however , recent pulsed nmr tip angle measurements on axially compressed aerogel at moderate magnetic fields ( both along and perpendicular to the strain axis ) show that the @xmath10 vector tends to be oriented in the plane of the cell and perpendicular to the strain axis regardless of the direction of the magnetic field.@xcite recent theoretical results@xcite also point to the possibility of a polar phase ( also an esp phase ) with a line of nodes away from the strain axis . in an earlier work we observed that the superfluid fraction in the esp phase is less than that in the b phase.@xcite",
    "if @xmath10 in the a phase ( nodal direction in the polar phase ) was aligned perpendicular to the flow , we would instead observe the superfluid fraction in the a phase to exceed that in the b phase.@xcite thus either an a phase with @xmath10 randomly oriented along the plane of the cell or a polar phase is consistent with the equal spin pairing state realized in this experiment .",
    "lacking nmr data to identify the phase at zero magnetic field , we refer to the intervening phase as esp rather than the a / polar phase .",
    "the metastable esp phase we observe is supercooled to temperatures well below the equilibrium esp to b phase boundary . on the other hand , after completion of the esp to b transition by further cooling the cell , the superfluid b phase persists on warming and the esp phase only reappears in a region of small temperature width very close to @xmath2 .",
    "this results in a significant range of temperatures over which we have esp phase on cooling and b phase on warming , and allows us to make a direct comparison of the properties ( @xmath11 ) of the two superfluid phases .    in the following sections , we briefly outline experimental details , and present the experimental data .",
    "then we discuss a model for the energy dissipation factor of the torsion pendulum arising from the normal state fluid . finally , we discuss the data below @xmath2 , where we observe additional dissipation intrinsic to the superfluid .",

    "the aerogel was grown directly into a pillbox shaped stainless steel cavity consisting of a tightly fitted lid , a base and a shim inserted between them .",
    "more about the physical properties and method of growth of aerogel can be found in ref . .",
    "the aerogel was compressed by 10% along its main axis by removing the shim and pressing the lid onto the base , bringing the height of the cell to 400 @xmath12 m .",
    "the height was chosen to be small enough to couple the aerogel well to the walls ( though aerogel displacement relative to the cell s walls still needs to be considered ) , but large enough to ensure fine resolution in determining the fraction of superfluid .",

    "quality factor ( @xmath8 ) of the empty cell at low temperatures exceeded one million .",
    "the steel cavity was dry fitted into an already hardened epoxy cast in order to reduce possible contamination of the aerogel by any epoxy penetrating through holes on the stainless pillbox . despite careful machining of the epoxy cast , there appeared to be empty regions around the periphery of the cell occupied by @xmath1he not embedded in the aerogel ( bulk fluid ) .",

    "the amplitude was chosen to be small enough so that any temperature dependent non - linear behavior could be avoided .",
    "this meant that the antisymmetric mode of the torsion oscillator was operated at an amplitude of @xmath16 0.1 nm , leading to a peak velocity of order 1 @xmath12m / sec .",

    "data for the resonant frequency of the pendulum in the normal state was used to determine the fraction of moment of inertia of the bulk fluid regions . subtracting this contribution from the measured inertia and dissipation we observe a residual dissipation of @xmath20 that we attribute to the @xmath1he liquid in the aerogel .",
    "uncertainty in the estimation of the bulk fluid contribution arises from limitations in our model , as well as uncertainty in the inputs to that model such as the fluid viscosity .",
    "in addition , any residual temperature gradients between the thermometer and the cell will produce significant scatter in our data .",
    "it is important to note that the dissipation does not have an obvious temperature dependence and any pressure dependence can not be discerned from the plot in fig .",

    "data was taken on both cooling and warming in the superfluid state at a number of different pressures .",
    "thermal gradient error could be rendered negligible in these measurements by maintaining a constant cooling ( warming ) rate ( @xmath21 @xmath12k / hr ) and through the observation of the bulk @xmath2 value , which is precisely known .",

    "the superfluid transition and phase diagram for this sample were identified in our previous publication.@xcite below the superfluid transition , we enter the superfluid esp - phase on cooling . at lower temperatures we observe a continuous phase transition between the esp and the b phase ( extended over a temperature interval of @xmath29k ) .",
    "it is thought that this width is due to the strong pinning of the interface by the aerogel . on warming we stay in the b - phase until just below the critical temperature .",
    "the reappearance of the esp phase is very pressure dependent .",

    "the dissipation rises , even though the impurity limited viscosity should be essentially constant .",
    "by contrast , the dissipation in the esp phase rises even faster than in the b phase and appears to be proportional to @xmath4 as the temperature is lowered ( fig .",
    "[ superfdisssep](b ) ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with experiments in the bulk , where the expectation is for the viscosity to drop sharply below @xmath2 and scale as @xmath32 in the finite size regime.@xcite @xmath19 scales well with @xmath4 and not @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ superfdisssep ] . since @xmath4 @xmath34 @xmath35",

    "a starting point in the model for the dynamics of the helium - aerogel system is to map out the velocity profiles of the fluid and the aerogel across the flow channel .",
    "we expect the fluid to be in a drude flow regime,@xcite where velocity of the fluid with respect to the aerogel is constant across the channel , with the exception of a small region of size @xmath38 away from the edges.@xcite the frictional relaxation time @xmath5 is related to the friction force coupling the helium with the aerogel matrix:@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the velocities of the helium liquid and the aerogel .",

    "this is an order of magnitude larger than the relevant dimensions of the cell , yet there is a small but finite displacement of the aerogel strands relative to the motion of the adjacent wall s surfaces .",
    "the normal helium is well locked to the aerogel ; the aerogel and helium form a composite medium exhibiting a velocity profile largely determined by the viscoelasticity of the aerogel . through numerical calculations ,",
    "we expect about 1% difference in the velocity in the middle of the cell and the wall .",
    "this velocity profile gives rise to a significant contribution to the dissipation in the cell .",
    "in addition , there is a small velocity difference between the entrained fluid and the aerogel itself that arises due to the finite value of @xmath5 .    to solve for the velocity profiles of the helium and the aerogel",

    "the shear modulus of the aerogel is @xmath12 , which we can deduce from the aerogel sound velocity .",
    "the viscosity of the helium @xmath52 would be similar to that of the bulk at high temperatures , but reach an impurity limited value at about 10 mk . as such , we expect @xmath53 poise .",
    "once we have solved for the velocity profiles , we find the induced torque on the walls of the cell .",
    "we assume that the velocity of both the liquid and the aerogel is equal to the velocity of the cell wall , i.e. @xmath54 . @xmath55    empty cell dissipation measurements show a nonzero value , even when extrapolated to @xmath56 .",
    "yet , a purely elastic aerogel should not be dissipative .",
    "a previous iteration of this experiment used an aerogel sample ( grown in a different process ) with a height of @xmath16 4 mm .",
    "the otherwise essentially identical torsion pendulum containing that cell had a @xmath8 @xmath16 100@xmath14 lower than the one described here .",
    "we can expect a @xmath57 dependence of the dissipation , with @xmath58 being the height of the cell .",
    "furthermore , there have been a number of experiments on silica aerogels ( though on samples denser compared to ours and at room temperature @xcite ) , that report a complex elastic modulus , which would lead to dissipation effects associated with the plastic deformations of the aerogel . we write the shear modulus of the aerogel as @xmath59 .",

    "there are three terms in eq .",
    "[ normmodel ] that contribute to the normal state dissipation .",
    "the first one is proportional to the normal fluid viscosity @xmath61 , and is due to the aerogel flexure modifying the velocity profile of the liquid and causing extra dissipation . using @xmath62 poise",
    ", this term accounts for a contribution to @xmath0 of the order of @xmath63 . in order to match the experimental value of @xmath64",

    "we suggest that the large temperature independent normal state dissipation could be due to the intrinsic dissipative nature of the aerogel , characterized by the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "the reason we are sensitive to the aerogel intrinsic dissipation term is the low resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum .",
    "since this term depends on @xmath69 , its contribution would be less significant at the higher frequencies employed in previous ultrasound attenuation experiments reported in ref . and .",
    "to obtain @xmath0 of the order of @xmath70 , we need @xmath71",
    ". such a large loss tangent could be due to the fractal nature of the aerogel or could be related to the expected presence of a few monolayers of solid @xmath1he on the surface of the aerogel strands .",

    "this allows us to accurately subtract the bulk fluid contributions and reveal the subtle pressure dependence of the data in the normal state .",
    "note that if our assumption that the main contribution to the dissipation in the normal state comes from the lossy aerogel , we would expect a linear relationship .",

    "this can not explain the dissipation we see in both the esp and b phase superfluid states .",
    "we compare the broad peak in dissipation we observe in the b phase and find it to be similar to the sound attenuation data below @xmath2 observed in ref . and in ref .",

    "we subtract the normal fluid contribution ( using parameters from the linear fit in fig . [ tcdiss ] ) and consider the residual dissipation .",
    "if we allow its origin to be due to the @xmath77 term , we can plot the so - inferred @xmath78 as a function of the temperature .",
    "[ superftauf ] shows this for the 29.1 bar data along with the data from ref . .",
    "we find a good agreement between the two experiments , implying that the observed dissipation in the 50 khz sound attenuation experiment and the torsion pendulum @xmath0 in the superfluid b phase probably have a similar origin .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ tautemp ] can be shown to increase as we enter the superfluid state due to the rapid opening of the superfluid gap , before @xmath46 eventually diminishes to near zero at extremely low temperatures.@xcite in addition , the denominator in eq .",
    "[ tautemp ] should also decrease as @xmath4 grows .",
    "these two effects combined produce a temperature dependence of @xmath5 with a similar shape to what we observe in fig .",
    "[ superftauf ] .",
    "we could expect an enhancement of @xmath5 in the superfluid state up to a factor of ten compared to its value at @xmath2 .",
    "however , in order to produce a peak @xmath5 of order 0.15 @xmath12s , we need @xmath79 ns , a value which is higher than the few nanoseconds that would be consistent with the @xmath2 suppression measurements . thus temperature variation of the frictional relaxation time can not solely produce the observed data .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there is an additional mechanism to dissipate energy not captured in the collision - drag model presented in section iv and related to the emergence of the superfluid order .",
    "one established way superfluid currents can dissipate energy is through interactions with bound states pinned to the boundary with the normal fluid at the vortex cores.@xcite this leads to a mutual friction term which can be shown to be proportional to@xcite @xmath80 such a term would produce a peak in the dissipation similar to what we observe in our data for the b superfluid phase . no evidence for vortex states has been found in our experiment .",
    "the velocity amplitude for the superfluid current is small , much smaller than the velocities the fluid is driven at in typical experiments observing vorticity.@xcite we also do not detect a noticeable increase in @xmath0 as we drive the pendulum harder .",
    "while the vortex dynamics model may not be applicable to our experiment , one can imagine that regions of normal fluid with the size of a typical vortex core ( coherence length ) exist , bound to denser regions of the aerogel .",
    "such bound states will allow for lower energy excitations to interact with the superfluid flow and provide a mechanism for energy dissipation .",
    "an object ( in this case an aerogel strand ) moving through bulk superfluid with velocity @xmath81 should feel a force that scales as @xmath82 , as shown in ref . .",
    "assuming that the nodes of the esp state order parameter tend to orient in the plane of the flow , then we would expect that the esp state should be associated with higher dissipation than the b phase .",
    "however , this argument does nt explain the different functional dependence of the dissipation in the esp phase in terms of @xmath4 compared to that of the b phase .",
    "finally , we note that the pressure dependence of the observed dissipation in terms of pressure could be related to the degree of gap suppression in both esp and b superfluid phases .",
    "dissipation is higher at high pressures , where the gap suppression is less severe , and lower at lower pressures where the superfluid gap tends to be less pronounced and the density of states at lower energies increases .",

    "we developed a model for the normal fluid dynamics as embedded in the viscoelastic aerogel .",
