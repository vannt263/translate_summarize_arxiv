    "the observation of a double - peaked structure in azimuthal di - hadron correlations @xcite arose a lot of recent interest , since it was suggested @xcite that this structure could be related to the emission angles of mach cones that are via mach s law ( @xmath0 ) directly related to the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "in general , energetic back - to - back jets produced in the early stages of a heavy - ion collision propagate through the medium , depositing energy and momentum along their path .",
    "certainly , the properties of this deposition depends on the physics of the jet - medium interactions .",
    "recently , different mechanisms of jet energy loss were analyzed , ranging from weak @xcite to strong coupling @xcite .",
    "while the static background offers the possibility to compare to results obtained from ads / cft , the expansion of a system formed in a heavy - ion collision will certainly influence any kind of jet deposition scenario @xcite . we demonstrate that taking into account various possible trajectories of jets propagating through the plasma @xcite lead to a double - peaked structure on the away - side of the final particle correlations . here",
    ", the medium is investigated using glauber initial conditions , corresponding to a gold nucleus with @xmath1  fm and a maximum temperature of @xmath2  mev .",
    "we focus on radial flow only and consider most central collisions , thus neglecting any elliptic flow contribution . for simplicity ,",
    "the medium is always considered as an ideal gas of massless su(3 ) gluons . in our system of coordinates ,",
    "the beam axis is pointing into the @xmath3 direction and the associated jet moves along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "assuming that the energy lost by the jet thermalizes quickly @xcite , we solve the ideal hydrodynamical equations using a ( @xmath5)-dimensional shasta algorithm @xcite @xmath6 the source term for the decelerating jet is given by @xmath7,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the proper time interval associated with the jet evolution and @xmath9 is the energy and momentum loss along the trajectory of the jet @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 , according to the bethe  bloch formalism @xcite , leading to a bragg peak as demonstrated in ref .  @xcite . for a jet starting at @xmath12",
    ", the initial energy loss rate can be determined by imposing that the jet stops after @xmath13  fm , resulting in @xmath14  gev / fm @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] displays the temperature and flow velocity profiles of a jet with an energy loss as determined above and vanishing momentum deposition ( left panel ) as well as an energy and momentum deposition ( right panel ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the creation of a diffusion wake behind the jet is clearly visible , which leads to an away - side peak in the associated jet direction @xcite after performing a cooper  frye ( cf ) @xcite freeze - out . considering vanishing momentum deposition ,",
    "the away - side peak is replaced by a conical ( double azimuthal peak ) distribution at the expected mach cone angle @xcite .",
    "+ the away - side diffusion peak in the particle correlation also prevails when considering the neufeld pqcd source term @xcite , because it involves a large momentum deposition ( see fig .",
    "[ cooperfrye_all ] ) .",
    "the freeze - out results of the ads / cft solution , however , show a double - peaked structure in spite of the diffusion plume due to a novel nonequilibrium strong coupling effect in the `` neck '' region as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ for the expanding medium , we choose the following ansatz for the energy and momentum depostition of the jet , scaling with the temperature of the dynamical background    @xmath15 ^ 3 \\delta^{(4 ) } \\left [ x^\\mu - x^\\mu_{\\rm jet}(\\tau ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16  gev / fm and @xmath17 . since deceleration does not alter the freeze - out results significantly @xcite , we do not include this effect in the present study for the expanding medium .",
    "below , we consider a @xmath18  gev trigger parton which corresponds to trigger-@xmath19 of @xmath20  gev assuming that a fragmenting jet creates particles with @xmath21% of its energy .",
    "+ experiments can only trigger on the jet direction , thus one has to consider different starting points for the jet which is done according to @xmath22 , where @xmath23  fm is chosen to model surface emission .",
    "we incorporate @xmath24 , @xmath25  degrees .    to model the experimental situation , the cf freeze - out results are convoluted by a gaussian representing the near - side jet , leading to a background subtracted , normalized , and jet - averaged cf signal for @xmath26  fm @xmath27\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this cf signal ( see solid lines in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ cfisochronous ] ) displays a broad away - side peak for @xmath28  gev , while a double - peaked structure occurs for @xmath29  gev .",
    "the reason is that the contribution of the different paths ( for @xmath30  degrees see lower panels of fig .",
    "[ cfisochronous ] ) add up to two peaks in the left and in the right part of the away - side ( dashed lines in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ cfisochronous ] ) .",
    "+ it is important to notice that the main contributions to the peaks in the left and right part of the away - side come from non - central jets ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ cfisochronous ] ) .",
    "+ thus , we have shown , using a full @xmath31-dimensional ideal hydrodynamical prescription , that a double - peaked away - side structure can be formed due to the different contributions of several possible jet trajectories through an expanding medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to conclude that this shape , interpreted as a conical signal , does not result from a `` true '' mach cone , but is actually generated by the averaging of distorted wakes .",
    "clearly , the emission angle of such a structure is not connected to the eos .",
    "however , these results do not imply that mach cones are not formed in heavy - ion collision .",
    "the effects of longitudinal expansion , finite impact parameter , and different freeze - out prescritiptions ( like coalescence @xcite ) remain to be considered .",
