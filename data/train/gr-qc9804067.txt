    "<S> we can give an arbitrary value for @xmath71 by choosing the value of @xmath72 . </S>",

    "<S> , we can fix the natural value of the metric component at the center . in three dimensions </S>",
    "<S> , we can not take a definite choice , because there is no _ local _ definition of mass ; an additional constant is allowed because it does not lead to a curvature singularity directly , unlike the higher - dimensional cases . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the reason why an arbitrary constant remains in the study of cruz and zanelli  @xcite on relativistic stars in @xmath0 dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can choose a plausible choice of the metric at the center , in order to give the definite properties of the boson star ; if one wishes to know the general case , one need only loose the constraint in the following analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose the following condition : @xmath73 according to this choice , the spatial metric at the origin looks like the one with no conical singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the condition  ( [ eq : eq23 ] ) determines the value of @xmath67 , as a function of @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> this choice for the boundary condition makes the mass of the scalar boson definite . in other words , if we take other values , the parameter @xmath2 does not represent the mass of the excitation of the boson field @xmath75 near the origin ; the value must be rescaled . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> since there is no asymptotically flat spacetime region , the identification of mass parameter in the most interior region is reasonable .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the relation between the btz mass of the boson star and @xmath74 from eqs .  </S>",
