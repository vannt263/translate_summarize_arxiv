    "outer rings in galaxies can be the result of plunging impacts , spiral and bar resonances , or satellite accretion onto a stable polar orbit .",
    "all types combined comprise less than 0.2% of local spiral galaxies ( athanassoula & bosma 1985 ) , although 4% of early type galaxies in de vaucouleurs & buta ( 1980 ) have outer resonance rings .",
    "galaxies with centrally located nuclei and smooth outer rings are sometimes referred to as `` o - type , '' while those with knotty structure and occasionally offset nuclei are called `` p - type '' ( few & madore 1986 ) .    collisional ring galaxies usually have a clumpy ring of star formation that is disk material compressed by a wave driven outward in response to the impacting galaxy s gravitational force ( lynds & toomre 1976 ; theys & spiegel 1976 , 1977 ; appleton & struck - marcell 1987 ; struck 1997 ) .",
    "generally the intruder is visible nearby and has a mass of at least @xmath5% of the main galaxy mass ( lavery et al .",
    "collisional ring galaxies may have nuclei or offset nuclei , or they could be empty inside with one prominent clump on the ring .",
    "all of these structures are expected to last for only a brief time , @xmath8 yrs ( theys & spiegel 1976 , 1977 ) .",
    "the most famous example of a collisional ring galaxy is the cartwheel ( fosbury & hawarden 1977 ; struck et al .",
    "1996 ) , which has an offset nucleus and a ring of recent star formation .",
    "a catalog of southern galaxies by arp & madore ( 1987 ) includes many examples of collisional ring galaxies .",
    "individual collisional ring galaxies studied recently include arp 107 ( smith et al . 2005 ) , vii zw 466 ( appleton , charmandaris , & struck 1996 ) , am0644 - 741 ( higdon & wallin 1997 , ngc 922 ( wong et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a sample of 11 galaxies including the cartwheel ( appleton & marston 1997 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of mergers have been used to reproduce many features of these nearby systems ( e.g. , review by barnes & hernquist 1992 ; hernquist & weil 1993 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; review by struck 1999 ) .",
    "resonance rings can be located near the nucleus , mid - disk , or outer disk , depending on the resonance ( see reviews by athanassoula & bosma 1985 ; buta & combes 1996 ) . among local galaxies , the outer resonance rings prefer early - type spirals ( de vaucouleurs & buta 1980 ) .",
    "polar rings are perpendicular to the central galaxy s plane and usually associated with s0 types .",
    "collisional ring galaxies should be relatively more common in the high redshift universe because interactions were more frequent in the past ( e.g. abraham et al .",
    "the merger rate as a function of redshift has been studied from visible morphologies ( straughn et al .",
    "2006 ) , comoving densities of collisional ring galaxies ( lavery et al .",
    "2004 ) , gini coefficients ( lotz et al .",
    "2006 ) , angular correlation functions ( neuschaefer et al .",
    "1997 ) , and asymmetry indices ( abraham et al . 1996b ; conselice et al .",
    "these studies find that the merger rate increases with redshift as @xmath9 for @xmath10 between 2 and 7 .    the gems ( galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ; rix et al .",

    "2004 ) surveys done with the hst acs ( hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ) have enabled unprecedented high resolution studies of the morphology of intermediate and high redshift galaxies . here",
    "we examine the gems and goods fields for ring and partial ring galaxies , and we compare the properties of these galaxies to their local counterparts and to similar objects in the udf .",
    "the udf , goods , and gems images from the public archive were used for this study .",
    "they include exposures in 4 filters for udf and goods : f435w ( b@xmath11 ) , f606w ( v@xmath12 ) , f775w ( i@xmath13 ) , and f850lp ( z@xmath14 ) ; and 2 filters for gems ( v and z ) .",
    "the images were drizzled to produce final archival images with a scale of 0.03 arcsec per px .",
    "gems , which incorporates the southern goods survey ( chandra deep field south , cdf - s ) in the central quarter of its field , covers 28 arcmin x 28 arcmin ; there are 63 gems and 18 goods images that make up the whole field .",
    "the goods images have a limiting ab mag of v@xmath12= 27.5 for an extended object , or about two mags fainter than the gems images .",
    "the udf is equivalent to one of these subfields , but probes to a depth of about 1.5 mag fainter than goods , or about 29 ab mag .",
    "there are over 25,000 galaxies catalogued for gems in the combo-17 survey ( classifying objects by medium - band observations , a spectrophotometric 17-filter survey ; wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) , as well as over 10,000 galaxies in the udf ( beckwith et al . 2004 , on the website archive.stsci.edu ) .",
    "we examined the gems and goods fields for ring galaxies , first using the online skywalker images , and then using the 81 high resolution v@xmath12 fits images .",
    "we chose a limiting diameter of @xmath15 pixels because it is difficult to discern a ring structure in smaller galaxies ; in fact , all of our rings are larger than 30 pixels .",
    "snapshots of the ring galaxies in the v@xmath12 images are shown in figure [ fig : bullsrings ] , and partial rings are in figure [ fig : bullspartial ] .",

    "the bottom three galaxies in figure [ fig : bullspartial ] have slightly different morphologies , called rk ( `` ring - knot '' ) by theys & spiegel ( 1976 ) ; they have a very large clump on the ring ( which may be the impacting galaxy ) and no large clump interior to the ring . in all",
    ", we selected 9 ring galaxies and 15 partial ring galaxies .",
    "gems and goods redshifts were obtained from the combo-17 list ( wolf et al .",
    "the data are in table [ tab : rings ] , which gives the combo-17 catalog number and redshift for the galaxies in order of presentation in the figures .",
    "the redshift ranges from @xmath17 to 1.4 in the surveyed area of @xmath18 arcsec@xmath19 . for comparison ,",
    "25 collisional ring galaxies were identified by lavery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in 162 wfpc2 ( wide field and planetary camera ) fields from z=0.1 to 1 , covering a comparable area of @xmath20 arcsec@xmath19 .",
    "our number per unit redshift and per unit solid angle is similar to theirs .    in the gems and goods fields ,",
    "15 other galaxies were found to resemble the clumpy arcs of partial ring galaxies , but they did not have nuclei or inner disks suggestive of a ring galaxy .",
    "they looked more like chain galaxies , which are common at intermediate to high redshift ( cowie , hu , & songaila 1995 ) .",
    "we refer to these 15 as `` bent chain '' galaxies .",
    "their properties are listed in table [ tab : rings ] , and they are shown in figure [ fig : bentchain ] , with 2-@xmath21 contour images in figure [ fig : contour2 ] that highlight the faintest structures . some bent chain galaxies could have suffered collisions like those in collisional ring galaxies , as indicated by the wide variety of shapes for direct hits shown by struck ( 1999 ) . in particular , struck simulates `` banana '' shapes reminiscent of bent chains , in addition to partial rings reminiscent of the galaxies in figure [ fig : bullspartial ] .",
    "it is not clear from the morphology alone whether bent chains are the same as partial rings ( we consider this difference in more detail below ) .    to help understand these bent chains , we compared them to straight chain galaxies and clump cluster galaxies , which are presumably face - on versions of chain galaxies .",
    "we identified 19 chain galaxies in the gems and goods field and added 29 chain and 44 clump cluster galaxies in the udf .",
    "the udf galaxies came from our morphology catalog of the udf , where we classified 884 galaxies larger than 10 pixels in diameter into one of six main morphological types : chain , double , tadpole , clump cluster , spiral , or elliptical ( elmegreen et al .",
    "the photometric redshifts of the udf galaxies were determined using the bayesian photometric redshift ( bpz ) method ( benitez 2000 ; coe et al .",
    "2006 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "for the present study , we used only the udf chains and clump clusters with @xmath22 , because the galaxies in our gems and goods surveys are primarily restricted to this regime .",
    "ellipse fits were done on the ring galaxies using the iraf task _",
    "ellipse_. from these , average radial profiles were made to assess the light and color distributions .",
    "the iraf task _ pvector _ was used to make intensity scans along the bent chain and chain galaxies .",
    "photometry was done on each prominent clump or nucleus in the gems and goods galaxies using the iraf task _ imstat _ , in which a box was defined around each clump to measure the number of pixels and mean pixel count .",
    "conversions to magnitudes were done using the zeropoints tabulated in the acs data handbook , www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/zeropoints .",
    "sky subtraction was not done because the background was negligible .",
    "the photometric errors are @xmath00.1 - 0.2 mag for individual clumps .",
    "the combo-17 table included restframe u , b , and v magnitudes for galaxies whose redshifts could be determined .",
    "figure [ fig : ringsf5 ] shows the absolute restframe v magnitude as a function of redshift for the integrated galaxy light from rings and partial rings ( dots ) , bent chains ( triangles ) , and chains ( circles ) in the gems and goods fields ( similar information has not been tabulated for the udf galaxies ) .",
    "the galaxies range from absolute rest @xmath23 to @xmath24 mag . three bent chains and one partial ring galaxy",
    "were eliminated from this figure because their small tabulated redshifts ( @xmath25 ) gave them absolute magnitudes of @xmath26 to @xmath27 , which is not sensible considering their similarity in appearance and angular size to the other galaxies in our sample .",
    "the figure indicates that the ring and partial ring galaxies are @xmath28 mag brighter at each redshift than the bent chain and chain galaxies .",
    "the linear diameters of the galaxies ( table [ tab : rings ] ) were determined from their redshifts and observed angular diameters using the conversion for a @xmath29cdm cosmology ( carroll , press , & turner 1992 ; spergel et al .",
    "they are shown on the left in figure [ fig : ringf10a ] for the gems and goods galaxies ( the right - hand side of the figure will be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "there is no correlation between minimum diameter and redshift because the chosen galaxies were generally much larger than our size cutoff .",
    "the drop in size for very small redshifts could be the result of redshift errors , as discussed above , or it could be the result of a selection of goods and gems fields that avoid galaxies large in angular size .",
    "the range in size for the sample is comparable to the range for local galaxies .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the gems and goods rings studied here are circumnuclear with the surrounding disks below the detection threshold .",
    "integrated restframe ( u - b ) and ( b - v ) colors are shown in figure [ fig : ringsf6 ] .",
    "the chain and bent chain galaxies in the gems field have colors similar to each other , and these are @xmath30 mag bluer than the ring and partial ring galaxies , suggesting more recent star formation in the chains and bent chains .",
    "the colors of the ring and partial ring galaxies are typical for local galaxies with intermediate to late types ( e.g. , fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) , but the chain and bent chain galaxies are bluer than local late - type galaxies .",
    "these blue colors are consistent with the common observation that high redshift galaxies of all types tend to be starbursting ( coe et al . 2006 ; elmegreen et al . 2006 ; de mello et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the radial profiles in v@xmath12 of the ring and partial ring galaxies were found to be approximately exponential in the inner regions out to the ring , suggesting the underlying disks are the same as in local spirals .",
    "inner exponentials also occur in local collisional ring galaxies .",
    "the ( v@xmath12 - z@xmath14 ) colors of our rings are 0.3 mag bluer than their average inner disks , suggesting enhanced ring star formation",
    ". such blue colors are consistent with observations and models of the cartwheel galaxy ( korchagin , mayya , & vorobyov 2001 ) , vii zw 466 ( thompson & theys 1978 ) , and other collisional ring galaxies ( appleton & marston 1997 ) .",
    "these local galaxies were observed in restframe b - v and v - k and not u - b , as in the present sample , but the relative blueness of the rings is the same for each .",
    "in contrast , the bent chains generally have little emission interior to their arcs , as evident in figure [ fig : contour2 ] .",
    "some bent chains have stray clumps nearby with approximately the same colors as the galaxies ( e.g. , galaxy no .",
    "11357 in combo17 , which is the bent chain in fig.[fig : bentchain ] with redshift 0.136 , and no .",
    "3618 [ z=0.764 ] ) .",
    "a stray clump with the same redshift could be a collision partner or it could be a remote part of the same disk that contains the bent chain .",
    "some chains also have an asymmetry in the sharpness of their edges on the inner and outer arcs ( e.g. combo17 no .",
    "3618 [ z=0.764 ] and 41096 [ z=0.113 ] ) , suggesting a disk or partial disk with the bent chain on the rim .",
    "thus , the bent chains could be partial ring galaxies , but the galaxy disks around the bent chains would have to be unusually faint . on the other hand , bent chains could be warped chain galaxies . along the lengths of the bent chains , the _ pvector _ intensity profiles are similar to those of other chain galaxies in the udf , which are irregular with no exponential gradients ( elmegreen , elmegreen , & sheets 2004 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "the v@xmath12 surface brightnesses of the galaxies were also determined using the national institutes of health software package _ imagej _ ( rasband 1997 ) , which allows measurement along a curved path . the average surface brightness in the interclump regions between the clumps is plotted for each galaxy versus @xmath31 in figure [ fig : ringsf7 ] .",
    "the intensity at a fixed restframe passband is expected to decrease from cosmological effects as the inverse of @xmath32 , as shown by the dotted line ( e.g. , lubin & sandage 2001 ) . with bandshifting in addition",
    ", the intensity could vary in a different way , depending on the star formation rate ; higher rates produce intrinsically bluer galaxies and less of a decrease with @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig : ringsf7 ] suggests that the interclump intensities for the ring and partial ring galaxies are similar to each other and decrease slightly with increasing @xmath34 , although not in proportion to @xmath33 .",
    "the spread in surface brightness for these galaxies is @xmath28 mag arcsec@xmath35 at each redshift .",
    "the bent chain galaxies are slightly different , having a nearly constant apparent interclump surface brightness , @xmath36 mag arcsec@xmath35 , independent of @xmath32 ( except for one bent chain at @xmath37 , which is combo17 no .",
    "this difference suggests that the interclump regions of bent chain galaxies have intrinsic surface brightnesses that increase rapidly with @xmath34 as a combined result of bandshifting into a relatively bright uv wavelength and an increasing star formation rates with look - back time .",
    "the rings and partial rings have a more constant intrinsic interclump v@xmath12 surface brightness , which is dimmed by cosmological effects without as much offset from star formation .",
    "the clump sizes and separations were measured for each galaxy .",
    "the right - hand side of figure [ fig : ringf10a ] shows the clump diameter versus redshift for the gems and goods galaxies ( the streaks correspond to integer numbers of pixels ) .",

    "there is a correlation between minimum clump size and @xmath34 because of angular resolution limits .",

    "the histograms peak at @xmath38 galaxy diameters regardless of galaxy type .",
    "the drop at lower relative size is probably from the resolution limit .",
    "the clump separations are typically 1 to 3 clump diameters , and about 0.1 to 0.2 times the galaxy diameters .",
    "these sizes and proportions are consistent with the formation of clumps by gravitational instabilities in chain galaxies and collisional rings , considering that the ambient jeans length is about the same as the clump separation . collisional ring star formation has been modeled in detail by struck - marcell & appleton ( 1987 ) , struck - marcell & higdon ( 1993 ) , and others .",
    "bent chains have the same clump sizes and relative separations as straight chains .",
    "figure [ fig : vbull ] shows the apparent v@xmath12 clump magnitude as a function of redshift for the gems and goods ring , partial ring , chain , and bent chain galaxies ( left ) , and for the udf chain and clump cluster galaxies ( right ) .",

    "the brightest gems and goods clumps in each morphology class are in the range from 25 to 26 mag , with no systematic trend in redshift . for the udf clumps , the brightest are at @xmath39 mag , which is about the same . however , the faintest detected clumps are 2 mags brighter in gems and goods than they are in the udf as a result of the brighter detection limit of the gems and goods surveys .",
    "a more detailed examination of the gems and goods galaxies also revealed extremely faint clumps , but they are too faint to measure ( e.g. , combo17 no . 47074 [ z=0.837 ] has very faint clumps in fig .",

    "the restframe apparent ( left ) and absolute ( right ) b magnitudes of the clumps are shown as a function of redshift in figure [ fig : vchain ] for galaxies in each sample .",
    "these restframe apparent magnitudes were found by interpolation between the observed passbands .",
    "for gems galaxies with @xmath34 between 0.39 and 0.95 , the restframe blue luminosity was taken to be @xmath40 for observed @xmath41 and @xmath42 luminosities .",
    "the restframe b magnitude is then @xmath43 . for goods and udf galaxies , which have 4 observed passbands",
    ", the linear interpolation was done between each pair of passbands .",
    "we converted the apparent restframe magnitudes to absolute restframe magnitudes by applying the distance modulus determined from a @xmath29cdm cosmology ( spergel et al .",
    "for both the apparent and absolute magnitudes , the brightest clumps are equally bright in all galaxies types . the redshift trend for absolute magnitude",
    "is from the size cutoff : only the largest clumps can be seen at the highest redshift ( fig .",

    "there is a slight redshift dependence towards redder colors with increasing @xmath34 for the ring and partial ring clumps .",
    "the superposed curves are models from bruzual & charlot , discussed above .",
    "the solid curves assume a clump age of @xmath2 years and 4 different star formation rate models : exponential decays with timescales of @xmath46 yr ( top curve ) , @xmath47 yr , and @xmath2 yr , and a continuous star formation rate ( bottom curve ) .",
    "the dashed curves assume a clump age of @xmath1 yrs , with 4 similar star formation rate models , as indicated , and the dotted curve assumes a clump age of @xmath46 yr and an exponentially decaying star formation rate with a decay time of @xmath46 yr .",

    "the local outer - resonance ring galaxies tend to be early - type spirals , which have low star formation rates today .    because bars can produce resonance rings and bars are red , some of the gems and goods ring galaxies might have bars that can not be seen at visible wavebands for our average @xmath63 . a mid - uv study of local galaxies ( windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ) reveals that morphology is often similar from uv to optical , with a bar showing up in b as well as uv .",
    "sometimes the change with passband is dramatic , however ; in ngc 6782 the optical bar is visible out to b band but disappears in the uv . while such a change is possible for our highest redshift galaxies , even at z=0.93",
    "we observe the restframe b band in the z@xmath14 images and most bars should still be present there",
    ". only 7 of our ring and partial ring galaxies are at higher redshift than this .",
    "thus we looked for bars in our ring sample .",
    "a few of the galaxies in figure [ fig : bullsrings ] ( top left [ no . 53346 , @xmath64 , middle right [ no .",
    "49092 , @xmath65 , bottom left [ no .",
    "43780 , @xmath66 , bottom right [ no .",
    "62696 , @xmath67 ) and figure [ fig : bullspartial ] ( top middle [ no . 34409 ,",
    "@xmath68 , top right [ no . 48709 , @xmath61 ] ) show slight elongations in their centers that could be bars or oval distortions capable of producing an outer resonance ring .",
    "none of these bars is as prominent as the strong bars seen in today s sb0 ring galaxies ( e.g. buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "collisional ring galaxies generally have small intruder galaxies nearby , so we examined the gems and goods fields surrounding the symmetric cases for possible companions .",
    "we found that four of the nine ring galaxies in figure [ fig : bullsrings ] ( top left [ no .",
    "53346 , @xmath64 , middle - middle [ no . 50905 , @xmath70 , bottom - left [ no .",
    "43780 , @xmath66 , bottom - right [ no .",
    "62696 , @xmath67 ) have small companions about 10 px in diameter with redshifts differing from the ring galaxy by less than 0.1 and appearing within 1 to 3 galaxy diameters .",
    "these four cases could therefore have collisional rings and not resonance rings .",
    "the galaxies without clear companions ( nos .",
    "47074 , 44999 , 58535 , 49092 , 25076 ) are the most likely examples of resonance ring galaxies .",
    "still , the morphology of these five candidates differs from the morphology of local outer - resonance ring galaxies .",
    "only one of the five has an elongated nucleus that could be a bar ( no . 49092",
    "[ @xmath65 ) ; the rest have small circular nuclei .",
    "this contrasts with local outer - ring galaxies , which are mostly barred or have strong spiral arms . in de vaucouleurs & buta ( 1980 ) ,",
    "there are 46 galaxies with outer rings , and 17 with the a - type bar class ( nominally , no bar ) . of these ,",
    "4 looked barred after all , 1 is a strong merger with long tidal arms , 4 have flocculent arms throughout that are somewhat brighter in the ring region ( but not a real ring ) , 2 others have spiral arms that wrap to an incomplete ring , and 2 have no visible ring ( based on b images in nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu ) . the remaining three ( ngc 1068 , ngc 4736 , ngc 3977 ) have smooth weak outer rings and large bright bulges and inner disks .",
    "these three local galaxies are the most similar to our four non - barred outer - ring candidates , although they are not identical . also , the bar fraction for the best examples of local outer ring galaxies is very high , while it is only 20% in our sample .",
    "it is conceivable that our four non - barred cases had bars when they formed their rings and then the bars dissolved later . such ring formation had to take @xmath71 gy or less for galaxies at @xmath72 . why most of the local outer - resonance ring galaxies still have their bars when the distant ones do not is a mystery .",
    "the average major axis diameter of the 5 candidate resonance rings is @xmath73 kpc .",
    "the average diameter of the outer rings in 46 local galaxies in the ring catalog of de vaucouleurs & buta ( 1980 ) is @xmath74 kpc ( using a hubble constant of 71 km s@xmath75 mpc@xmath75 ) .",
    "the local and high redshift diameters are sufficiently close to each other that there could not have been a major change in outer ring position over the last @xmath76 gy since @xmath77 .",
    "the slight increase seen here is consistent with an overall growth of galaxies over this time , by @xmath6% or so ( with large uncertainties ) , or with a comparable slow down in the pattern speed for whatever drives the resonance .",
    "bar pattern speeds are expected to slow down as the bar transfers angular momentum to the halo ( athanassoula 2003 ) .",
    "athanassoula ( 2003 ) found that this interaction can slow down a bar in the last @xmath71 gy by 10% to 40% , depending on the relative mass of the disk , bulge , and halo ( see her figures 10 and 11 ) .",
    "this range is consistent with the small increase in ring diameter found here for the same period of look - back time .",
    "other local analogs for the gems and goods galaxies are accretion rings ( see buta & combes 1996 ) , such as hoag s object , a1515 + 2146 ( schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ) , which either has a central e0 galaxy that accreted gas , or was once barred .",
    "other accretion rings include the more commonly described polar ring galaxies , which tend to have s0 galaxies in their centers and rings perpendicular to the disks ( whitmore et al . 1990 ) .",
    "to match our observed galaxies , we would have to be viewing such a galaxy edge - on so the ring looks circular , but we do not see any extended central component that could be an edge - on spiral disk . also , the atlas by whitmore et al . shows that polar rings tend to be much smoother than the clumpy rings of the gems and goods galaxies .",
    "a total of 9 ring and 15 partial ring galaxies was found through visual examination of the gems and goods fields .",
    "an additional 15 bent chain galaxies was also observed .",
    "the clumps in the rings have diameters of @xmath01 kpc , depending on redshift .",
    "this is similar to the diameters of clumps in local collisional ring galaxies .",
    "the bent chains have restframe colors that are bluer than those in ring and partial ring galaxies .",
    "the individual clumps in the bent chain galaxies are also bluer than the clumps in rings and partial rings .",
    "the average star formation ages of the clumps in bent chains equals 10@xmath78 to a few times @xmath1 yr ; in the rings and partial rings it is a few times @xmath1 to @xmath2 yrs .",
    "clump masses range from a few x 10@xmath79 to a few x 10@xmath58 m@xmath53 , with slightly lower values in bent chains . the measured clump mass increases with redshift because of resolution limits",
    ".    the morphologies and dimensions of local collisional ring galaxies are similar to the morphologies and dimensions of many of the ring galaxies in the goods and gems fields .",
    "their clumps also have about the same sizes , ages , and masses .",
    "this similarity implies that many of the gems and goods rings and partial rings formed by plunging impacts of small companions through pre - existing spiral galaxies .",
    "other galaxies in our sample , particularly the most isolated and symmetric and with the most centered nuclei , could have resonance rings instead of collisional rings .",
    "they differ from local resonance ring galaxies in having more star formation at high redshift , and therefore larger and bluer clumps in the rings .",
    "some have slight indications of a bar , although the bar fraction seems lower for the best resonance ring cases than it is in the local universe .",
    "the existence of outer resonance rings in goods and gems galaxies implies it takes only @xmath71 gy for the rings to form . after aging for another @xmath7 gy and avoiding disruptive collisions",
    ", they could turn into the modern versions of outer - resonance rings , which are smooth , red , and usually in early type galaxies .",
    "if this is the case , then the similarity in diameter between the rings in our sample and the local outer resonance rings ( local rings are @xmath6% larger ) implies that spiral and bar pattern speeds have not changed by more than a factor of @xmath80 during last half of the life of the galaxy .",
    "this result may have important implications for nuclear gas accretion , which can speed up a bar , and bar - halo interactions , which can slow down a bar ( athanassoula , lambert & dehnen 2005 ) .",
    "for example , bar - halo interactions studied by athanassoula ( 2003 ) slow down a bar and extend the outer lindblad resonance by about this much during the same time interval .",
    "the bent chain galaxies in our survey differ from the ring galaxies , having younger , slightly less - massive clumps and no evidence for an underlying , nearly face - on disk .",
    "the bent chains could be edge - on , clumpy , and bulge - free disks that got warped by an interaction .",
    "they resemble the straight chain galaxies that are observed in deep fields .",
    "local disk galaxies do not have such large clumps as chains , nor are the local disks warped into similar arc - like shapes .",
