    "the problem of the existence of periodic orbits for hamiltonian systems has a very far and rich history in the development of mathematics and physics .",
    "in fact , some of the major contributions on this question include the celebrated poincar - birkhoff theorem on the existence of periodic orbits for area preserving twist maps on the annulus and the morse - lyusternik - schnirelman theory on the existence of closed geodesics on compact riemannian manifolds .",
    "recently , a special class of symplectic invariants was introduced by h. hofer and e. zehnder @xcite as a link between rigidity phenomena of symplectic mappings and the existence of periodic orbits provided by classical variational methods .",
    "more precisely , they introduced an axiomatic definition of symplectic capacities in the following way :    consider the class of all symplectic manifolds @xmath33 of fixed dimension equal to 2n .",
    "a symplectic capacity is a map @xmath34 that associates to @xmath2 a non negative number or @xmath35 and that satisfies the following axioms :    * * monotonicity : * if there exists a symplectic embedding @xmath36 then @xmath37 * * conformality : * @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the ball of radius @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the cylinder over the @xmath42-plane .",
    "a distinguished symplectic capacity was introduced by hofer and zehnder and is directly related to the question of the existence of periodic orbits on prescribed energy levels of hamiltonian flows :    [ defchz ] given a symplectic manifold @xmath2 , define the hofer - zehnder capacity of @xmath18 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the set of _ admissible hamiltonians _ @xmath45 defined on @xmath18 , that is ,    * @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the set of _ pre - admissible hamiltonians _ defined on @xmath18 , that is , @xmath45 satisfies the following properties : @xmath48 , there exist an open set @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and a compact set @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 ; * every non - constant periodic orbit of @xmath53 has period greater than 1 .",
    "intuitively , this capacity measure the sufficient oscillation for a pre - admissible hamiltonian to have fast periodic orbits , that is , of period less than one .",
    "it is easy to see that it satisfies the monotonicity and conformality properties .",
    "remarkably , by making use of classical variational methods , hofer and zehnder @xcite showed that it also satisfies the non - triviality axiom , giving , in particular , a dynamical new proof of gromov s nonsqueezing theorem @xcite .",
    "moreover , this symplectic invariant has important consequences on the question of the existence of periodic orbits on prescribed energy levels of hamiltonian systems .",
    "in fact , it is easy to prove that if a symplectic manifold @xmath2 has _ bounded hofer - zehnder capacity _ , that is , if @xmath54 for every open subset @xmath55 with compact closure , then given any hamiltonian @xmath56 with compact energy levels , there exists a dense subset @xmath57 such that for every @xmath58 the energy hypersurface @xmath59 has a periodic solution .",
    "this result was improved by m. struwe in @xcite showing that if the energy hypersurfaces bound a compact submanifold then @xmath22 has total lebesgue measure .",
    "this condition is not necessary as was proved recently in @xcite .",
    "note that as an immediate consequence we have a proof of the weinstein conjecture @xcite for manifolds with bounded hofer - zehnder capacity , since we can construct in a neighborhood of a contact hypersurface @xmath60 a distinguished parametrized family of hypersurfaces with equivalent flows .",
    "unfortunately , it is , in general , a difficult task to determine when a symplectic manifold has bounded hofer - zehnder capacity . for @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the canonical symplectic form , it follows by hofer - zehnder theorem @xcite . for surfaces ,",
    "it was proved by k. siburg @xcite , that the hofer - zehnder capacity of an open subset @xmath63 coincides with the area of @xmath63 .",
    "however , the situation is dramatically different for higher dimensional manifolds .",
    "actually , hofer and viterbo showed in @xcite that @xmath64 where @xmath2 is any closed symplectic manifold and @xmath65 is the two dimensional disk of radius @xmath66 , with @xmath40 satisfying the condition @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the _ index of rationality _ of @xmath2 , that is , @xmath69}\\om;\\ \\ [ u ] \\in \\pi_2(m ) \\text { satisfies } \\int_{[u]}\\om > 0\\bigg\\}.\\ ] ] if the above set is empty , we define @xmath70 . recall that a 2-form @xmath71 on @xmath18 is _ weakly exact _ if it is closed and @xmath70 .",
    "this result was extended by g. lu @xcite to noncompact symplectic manifolds satisfying certain conditions at the infinity .",
    "more precisely , he showed that @xmath72 provided that @xmath2 is geometrically bounded and @xmath73 .",
    "a symplectic manifold @xmath2 is called _ geometrically bounded _ if there exists an almost complex structure @xmath74 on @xmath18 and a riemannian metric @xmath75 such that    * @xmath74 is uniformly @xmath71-tame , that is , there exist positive constants @xmath76 and @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for all tangent vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 to @xmath18 ; * the sectional curvature of @xmath75 is bounded from above and the injectivity radius is bounded away from zero .",
    "the closed symplectic manifolds are clearly geometrically bounded ; a product of two geometrically bounded symplectic manifolds is also such a manifold .",
    "moreover , it was proved in @xcite that the cotangent bundle of a compact manifold endowed with any twisted symplectic form is geometrically bounded ( a proof of this fact can also be found in @xcite ) . a _ twisted symplectic structure _ on a cotangent bundle @xmath81 is a symplectic form given by @xmath26 , where @xmath62 is the canonical symplectic form , @xmath82 is the canonical projection and @xmath15 is a closed 2-form on @xmath18 .",
    "thus , using the monotonicity property , we can conclude that @xmath83 has bounded hofer - zehnder capacity , where @xmath6 is any compact manifold and @xmath62 is the canonical symplectic form ( because we can embed symplectically any bounded subset of @xmath84 into @xmath85 ) .",
    "actually , by the same reason , we can prove that @xmath86 has bounded hofer - zehnder capacity for any geometrically bounded symplectic manifold @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noted that it is necessary to consider product symplectic forms @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , there is an example due to zehnder @xcite of a symplectic form on @xmath88 with unbounded hofer - zehnder capacity .",
    "note that any symplectic form on @xmath89 is weakly exact .",
    "other known example of cotangent bundle with bounded hofer - zehnder capacity is @xmath90 endowed with any twisted symplectic form @xmath91 , where @xmath15 is a closed 2-form on @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the canonical projection .",
    "it was proved by j. jiang @xcite for @xmath94 and by v. ginzburg and e. kerman @xcite for the general case .",
    "we will consider here a refinement of the hofer - zehnder capacity by considering periodic orbits whose homotopy class is contained in a given subgroup @xmath0 of @xmath95 .",
    "more precisely , we define the hofer - zehnder semicapacity as follows ; it can be compared with the @xmath96-sensitive hofer - zehnder capacity defined by m. schwarz @xcite and lu @xcite and the relative symplectic capacity introduced by p. biran , l. polterovich and d. salamon @xcite :    given a symplectic manifold @xmath2 and a subgroup @xmath3 define the _ hofer - zehnder g - semicapacity _ of @xmath18 ( or _ @xmath0-sensitive hofer - zehnder capacity _ ) by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the set of _ @xmath0-admissible hamiltonians _ defined on @xmath18 , that is ,    * @xmath99 , that is , @xmath45 is pre - admissible ( see definition [ defchz ] ) ; * every nonconstant periodic orbit of @xmath53 whose homotopy class belongs to @xmath0 has period greater than 1 .",
    "we call it a _ semicapacity _ because given a symplectic embedding @xmath100 such that @xmath101 it can not be expected , in general , that @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the induced homomorphism on the fundamental group . however , we can state the following _ weak monotonicity property _ ( for a proof see section [ proofthma ] ) : given a symplectic embedding @xmath104 such that @xmath101 then @xmath105 for every subgroup @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath107 is injective we have that @xmath108 .    note that obviously , @xmath109 for every subgroup @xmath3 . moreover , it can be show that if the hofer - zehnder @xmath0-semicapacity is bounded then there are periodic orbits with homotopy class in @xmath0 on almost all energy levels for every proper hamiltonian @xcite . a symplectic manifold @xmath2 has _ bounded hofer - zehnder @xmath0-semicapacity _ if for every open subset with compact closure @xmath110 , we have that @xmath111    we remark that the periodic orbits in @xmath112 given by the theorems of hofer - viterbo and lu are _",
    "contractible_. thus , in terms of symplectic semicapacities , their theorems state the stronger result that @xmath113 for any geometrically bounded symplectic manifold @xmath2 and @xmath114 . by the weak monotonicity property",
    ", we can conclude then that @xmath115 is bounded , where @xmath116 is the obvious subgroup generated by the circle in the cylinder @xmath117 .",
    "in fact , the kernel of the induced homomorphism on the fundamental group of the symplectic embedding of @xmath118 into @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 .",
    "the aim of the first part of this paper is to generalize this result in the following way : note that @xmath121 has a natural hamiltonian free circle action with hamiltonian given by the angle form @xmath122 viewed here as a function on @xmath123 .",
    "we will consider the following :    is the existence of a hamiltonian free circle action sufficient to ensure the boundedness of the hofer - zehnder semicapacity ( with respect to the subgroup of @xmath95 generated by the orbits of the action ) ?",
    "before we state our first result we need a previous topological definition related to free circle actions :    let @xmath124 be a free circle action on a connected open subset @xmath6 of a manifold @xmath18 .",
    "we define the _ order of the action _ @xmath125 as the order of the cyclic subgroup of @xmath95 generated by the homotopy class of the orbits of @xmath125 .    now , we are able to state our first theorem . in what follows",

    "* note that the previous theorem can not be stated directly for @xmath6 because we need to assume that @xmath18 is geometrically bounded and it not clear that an open subset of a geometrically bounded symplectic manifold is geometrically bounded . * the circle action above needs to be hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the example of herman - zehnder @xcite has unbounded hofer - zehnder capacity and it is easy to see that it admits a free symplectic circle action with infinite order .",
    "before we explain the main ideas involved in the proof of theorem [ thma ] , let us state some corollaries and applications .",

    "we define then the length of this curve by @xmath642 the hofer s metric is then defined by @xmath643 where the infimum is taken over all paths @xmath248 which join @xmath169 and @xmath268 .    for",
    "a subset @xmath63 of @xmath18 define the displacement energy @xmath644 as the measure of the distance between the identity map and the set of @xmath645 which displaces @xmath63 from itself , in the sense that @xmath646 .    using the geometry of the hofer s metric and that , for a manifold whose euler characteristic vanishes",
    ", the displacement energy of the zero section of @xmath81 , with the twisted symplectic form given by a non - vanishing magnetic field , is equal to zero , polterovich @xcite proved the following theorem :    [ polterovich @xcite ] let @xmath18 be a closed manifold whose euler characteristic vanishes and @xmath15 a non - vanishing weakly exact magnetic field .",
    "then there exist contractible magnetic closed orbits on a sequence of arbitrarily small energy levels .",
    "the idea of the proof is the following @xcite : take a smooth function @xmath647 , @xmath648 , which equals @xmath649 on @xmath650 $ ] , vanishes on @xmath651 and is strictly increasing on @xmath652 .",
    "thus , the closed orbits of the ( normalized ) hamiltonian @xmath653 corresponds to reparametrized magnetic periodic orbits whose energy is less than @xmath654 .",
    "the key point is that the minimum set of @xmath598 coincides with the zero section of @xmath81 and so its displacement energy vanishes @xcite .",
    "it implies that the asymptotic non - minimality of @xmath598 is strictly less than 1 and thus that @xmath598 ( as a vector in the lie algebra @xmath632 ) does not generate a minimal geodesic in @xmath630 @xcite .",
    "then , using a result of lalonde and mcduff @xcite , we conclude that the hamiltonian @xmath598 has a non - constant contractible closed orbit , since @xmath15 is weakly exact .",
    "it should be noted that the contractibility of the periodic orbits given by lalonde and mcduff follows by the fact that the proof of theorem 5.4 of @xcite relies on the hofer - zehnder capacity - area inequality ( theorem 1.17 of @xcite ) proved by floer , hofer and viterbo @xcite , where the periodic orbits are contractible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider the trivial @xmath218-bundle @xmath655 , the flat connection @xmath656 and the product metric @xmath657 .",
    "let @xmath658 be the pullback of the magnetic field @xmath15 to @xmath157 .",
    "the lifted circle action to @xmath659 is hamiltonian with respect to the twisted symplectic form @xmath660 , where @xmath661 is the canonical projection .",
    "in fact , let @xmath662 the vector field on @xmath659 that generates the circle action .",
    "then , @xmath663 where @xmath656 above is viewed as a function in @xmath659 . moreover , the form @xmath656 is invariant by the magnetic flow of @xmath659 , because taking a magnetic orbit @xmath248 in @xmath157 , we have that @xmath664 where @xmath665 denotes the lorentz force of the magnetic field @xmath658 ( defined as the bundle map @xmath666 uniquely characterized by the property that @xmath667 ) and in the third equation we used the fact that @xmath453 is parallel .    thus , the magnetic flow on @xmath659 is equivariant with respect to the hamiltonian lifted action of @xmath218 to @xmath659 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to see that the marsden - weinstein reduced symplectic manifold with respect to the circle action on @xmath668 is given by @xmath669 .",
    "moreover , the pullback of the hamiltonian metric @xmath670 in @xmath25 by @xmath671 is given by @xmath672 .",
    "consequently , the reduced dynamics of the magnetic flow @xmath673 of @xmath157 on @xmath674 is given by the magnetic flow @xmath675 on @xmath18 .",
    "now , suppose that @xmath15 is weakly exact .",
    "since @xmath157 is the product , the fibers of @xmath157 are non - contractible and , in fact , the subgroup generated by the fibers in @xmath676 is isomorphic to @xmath677 .",
    "since the euler characteristic of @xmath157 vanishes and @xmath678 is weakly exact ( because @xmath679 ) , we can apply polterovich s theorem to conclude that @xmath673 has contractible closed orbits @xmath680 of arbitrarily small energy .",
    "since the subgroup in @xmath676 generated by the fibers of @xmath157 is cyclic infinite , these orbits can not be given by the fibers .",
