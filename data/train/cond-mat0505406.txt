    "aqueous foams consist of gas bubbles separated by liquid films@xcite . in dry foams , these bubbles are deformed to polyhedra .",
    "always three films meet in the so - called plateau borders which form a network of liquid channels throughout the foams .",
    "their opaque appearance identifies them as multiply scattering media .",
    "moreover , careful light - scattering experiments show that light transport has reached its diffusive limit in foams  @xcite which means that photons perform a random walk .",
    "diffusion of light is well established in colloidal systems  @xcite , where light is scattered from particles , or in nematic liquid crystals  @xcite , where scattering occurs from fluctuations in the local optical axis .",
    "diffusing - wave  @xcite and diffuse - transmission spectroscopy  @xcite provide non - invasive probes of structure and dynamics in bulk samples .",
    "while these methods have already successfully been applied to monitor the internal dynamics of foams  @xcite , no clear understanding has emerged so far about the basic mechanism underlying the random walk of photons in these cellular structures .",
    "estimates for the scattering from plateau borders do not seem to be in accordance with experiments  @xcite .",
    "scattering from vertices formed by four meeting plateau borders would be another possibility  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since gas bubbles in foams are much larger than the wavelength of light , one can use the laws of ray optics to follow the photons on their random walk as they are reflected by the liquid films  @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper was initiated by a very inspiring publication of gittings , bandyopadhyay , and durian published under the same title  @xcite .",
    "the authors argued that total reflection of light at the liquid - gas interface in a foam should increase the probability of photons to propagate in the liquid phase , made up by thin films and plateau borders , and they termed this effect photon channelling . by measuring the absorption of light in foams with strongly absorbing liquid , they determined the fraction @xmath0 of a photon s path that lies in the liquid .",
    "equal distribution of the photons throughout the foam would give @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the liquid fraction in the foam .",
    "however , the authors found that in a certain range of @xmath1 the path - length fraction @xmath0 fulfills @xmath3 .",
    "this not only confirms photon channelling but it also gives clear evidence that the basic mechanism for light transport in foams depends on the liquid volume fraction .",
    "motivated by these findings , we perform a thorough theoretical study of photon channelling in this article based on analytical arguments and numerical simulations using ray optics .",
    "_ derived a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it contains the ratio of averaged transmission probabilities which they determined both by experiments and simulations . in sec .",
    "[ channel.analytic ] , we demonstrate how this ratio follows from general arguments and are therefore able to justify the relation @xmath4 on completely analytical grounds .",
    "furthermore , gittings _ et al .",
    "_ stated that the effect of photon channelling would prevent the photons from performing a `` truely random walk''@xcite .",
    "indeed , our numerical investigation in sec .",
    "[ superdiff ] shows that transport of light in a perfect honeycomb foam is superdiffusive .",
    "the effect is most pronounced when the liquid - gas interface is totally reflecting  @xcite .",
    "however , the transport becomes diffusive as soon as the foam contains disorder .",
    "this demonstrates that photon channelling is compatible with the concept of random walk . to complete our numerical study of photon channelling ,",
    "we have developed a one - dimensional random walk model .",
    "it contains a photon - channelling state and can therefore explain the main features of our numerical investigation .",

    "[ model ] , we present two - dimensional model foams for our photon - channelling study and explain how we simulate the photons random walk based on the laws of ray optics . in sec .",
    "[ channel ] , characteristic features of photon channelling are first explained analytically and then compared with simulation results .",
    "the transport properties of light in our model foams are described in sec .",
    "[ photondiff ] .",
    "numerical results on superdiffusion in perfect honeycomb structures and diffusion in disordered foams are presented .",
    "finally , we introduce the one - dimensional random - walk model for photon channelling .",
    "section  [ conclus ] summarizes and discusses our results .",
    "to introduce a simple model for a two - dimensional foam , we start from a voronoi tessellation of the plane  @xcite .",
    "it is generated from a distribution of seed points in a simulation box , for which voronoi polygons are constructed in complete analogy to the wigner - seitz cells of periodically arranged lattice sites .",
    "we begin with a triangular lattice of seed points that gives a regular honeycomb structure whose edges possess the length @xmath5",
    ". then we systematically introduce disorder by shifting the seed points along a randomly chosen displacement vector whose magnitude is equally distributed in the intervall @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "examples of voronoi foams are presented , e.g. , in ref .",
    "note , while the structure and evolution of real foams are constrained by plateau s rules and laplace s law  @xcite , simple honeycomb , voronoi , and three - dimensional kelvin structures were used for a first study of the physical properties of foams@xcite .",
    "all our voronoi tessellations are produced by the software _ triangle _",
    "they contain approximately @xmath7 cells which corresponds to a quadratic simulation box with edge length 200 @xmath5 .",
    "now , on each edge of the voronoi tessellation , we place a channel of width @xmath8 that represents a liquid film .",
    "our final model foam for @xmath9 is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : channel ] . for this regular honeycomb foam ,",
    "we calculate the fraction of the plane filled by the liquid phase as @xmath10 in the following , we only investigate foams with modest disorder quantified by @xmath11 .",
    "this avoids the unphysical situation that four instead of three channels or films meet when we construct our model foams .",
    "all cells still have six edges .",
    "furthermore , to simulate photon diffusion in the model foams , periodic boundary conditions are used .    ) and a photon s random walk in this structure . ]",
    "we let photons perform a random walk in our model foams by applying the rules of geometrical optics ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : channel ] ) .",
    "the photons move straight in the liquid or gaseous phase with respective velocities @xmath12 or @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the vacuum speed of light and @xmath15 are refractive indices .",
    "when the photons hit a liquid - gas interface , they are reflected with a probability , also called reflectance , given by fresnel s formulas .",
    "the respective reflectances for electric polarizations parallel or perpendicular to the plane of incidence are @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the respective angles of a light ray in the liquid or gaseous phase measured relative to the normal on the interface .",
    "they are connected by snellius law : @xmath19 .",
    "note that fresnel s formulas are symmetric in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so the reflectance is the same whether the light ray is hitting the interface coming from the liquid or the gaseous phase .",
    "however , there is an important difference : light rays in the optically denser medium ( @xmath20 ) experience total reflection for an incident angle @xmath21 .",
    "we stress this point here because it is central for the occurence of photon channelling .",
    "typically , we launch 10000 photons at one vertex of the underlying voronoi tesselation in an angular range of @xmath22 and let them run during a time @xmath23 . at several times , we calculate the mean square displacement @xmath24 from the photon cloud and plot it as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "diffusion constants are then determined from a fit to @xmath26 .",
    "at the core of the observation of photon channelling is the fact that photons can totally be reflected when they hit the liquid - gas interface from the liquid side .",
    "accordingly , a photon spends more time in the liquid phase or , more accurately , the fraction @xmath0 of the photon s path that lies in the liquid phase is not equal to the liquid volume fraction @xmath1 .",
    "et al _ measured @xmath0 with",
    "the help of a strongly absorbing liquid and then made a prediction for the two averaged transmission probabilities for photons going from the liquid to the gaseous phase ( @xmath27 ) or the reverse direction ( @xmath28 ) . only in the range @xmath29",
    ", they found that the ratio @xmath30 deviates from one , indicating photon channelling .",
    "furthermore they gave its approximate value as @xmath31 and also confirmed it by simulations .",
    "in the following , we derive this central relation for @xmath30 analytically , connect it to @xmath0 and compare it with our simulations .",
    "we start with defining the averaged transmission probability @xmath27 by @xmath32 where the angle - dependent transmission coefficient @xmath33 is connected to the reflectance @xmath34 of fresnel s formulas introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fresnel ] ) .",
    "note that only the angular range of @xmath35 contributes to the integral since @xmath36 is @xmath37 for @xmath38 due to total reflection .",
    "the factor @xmath39 is the normalised probability of a photon to reach the interface from the liquid side with an incident angle @xmath17 . we write it as @xmath40 accordingly ,",
    "we define the transmission probability @xmath41 by @xmath42 where we used the symmetry of fresnel s formulas with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "we still take the angle @xmath17 for the averaging , therefore the upper limit of the integral is just @xmath44 since photons entering the liquid can not have a @xmath17 larger than @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath35 it makes sense to assume that photons coming from the gaseous into the liquid phase possess the same angular distribution as photons in the liquid , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "so we write @xmath46 note again the different upper limit in the integral of the normalization factor compared to eq .",

    "since @xmath36 is @xmath37 for @xmath38 , the transmission probabilities of eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) appear the same however they differ by the normalization factors of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) as just mentioned .",
    "therefore the ratio of the averaged transmission probabilities is @xmath49    we now assume that all directions of the photons are equally distributed in the liquid and therefore obtain for the angular distribution of photons reaching the interface , @xmath50 .",
    "the term @xmath51 means that the number of photons hitting a given surface area decreases with increasing @xmath17 , i.e. , photons approaching the interface on a `` shallow '' path ( @xmath52 ) have a vanishing probability to hit a given surface area . with @xmath53 ,",
    "the ratio of the mean transmission probabilities becomes immediately @xmath54 this is the result of gittings _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured in the range @xmath29 for the liquid fraction . in our simulations we realize @xmath55 by starting the photons in the liquid with a uniform angular distribution . in experiments , photons always enter from the gaseous phase",
    ". a fast randomization of the angular distribution in the liquid phase is then achieved by disorder in the foam and by the strong curvature of the interface at the plateau borders .",
    "such a randomization due to curvature occurs , e.g. , in the sinai billard  @xcite .",
    "we now derive how the fraction @xmath0 of a photon s path that lies in the liquid phase depends on the liquid volume fraction @xmath1 .",
    "we assume a stationnary photon distribution in the foam .",

    "this agrees with our finding that the diffusion constant @xmath106 only exhibits a weak divergence for decreasing disorder parameter @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , according to our simulations and in agreement with intuition , @xmath106 decreases with increasing refractive index @xmath87 and also with increasing channel - width - to - length ratio @xmath83 .",
    "we are able to model this dependence with the help of a one - dimensional random walk model but only when we introduce a photon - channelling state .",
    "therefore , the importance of photon - channelling becomes evident .",
    "the decrease of @xmath106 with increasing @xmath83 or liquid fraction @xmath1 is in qualitative agreement with measurements by vera _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . however , there is an important difference ; whereas vera _",
    "_ observe a divergence of the diffusion constant for @xmath165 , it assumes a finite value in our simulations and analytic model .",
    "the reason is that we consider independent transmission and reflection events at each single liquid - gas interface .",
    "if the film thickness becomes sufficiently thin , the effective reflectance and transmittance of thin films seems to be more appropriate , where interference effects are taken into account   @xcite .",
    "they lead to a strong decrease of the reflectance for @xmath165 and therefore to a divergence of @xmath106 .",
    "building on the work of gittings _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we are able to justify their observed relation between the photon s path - length fraction @xmath0 in the liquid phase and the liquid fraction @xmath1 without any free parameters .",
    "their further observation that photon channelling only occurs in the region @xmath166 will help to improve our understanding of light propagation in foams . for @xmath167 , the extension of the plateau borders and films",
    "are probably too small that pure ray optics is applicable and therefore photon channelling breaks down . in this parameter region",
    ", we suggest that the reflectance and transmittance of thin films which include interference effects , as already mentioned in the last paragraph , are the appropriate quantities to model the photons random walk",
    ". however , we have no understanding why photon channelling ceases for @xmath168 . especially , our analytic considerations in sec .  [ channel.analytic ]",
    "employ very general arguments without relying on a concrete foam structure , so it is not evident why they should break down for larger volume fractions .",
    "nevertheless , we show in this article that photon channelling in liquid foams can be understood on the basis of ray optics through analytic considerations and simulations using simple model foams .",
    "it seems that details of the foam structure are unimportant .",
    "we are confident that the results presented in this article add another piece to the puzzle of explaining diffusive light transport in cellular structures such as aqueous foams .",
