    "galaxies in dense clusters evolve mainly due to tidal interactions , mergers and ram pressure stripping with accretion contributing to the buildup of the cd galaxies that often reside at the bottom of the cluster potential ( dressler  1984 ) .",
    "these processes are expected to be most effective in the cluster cores where higher densities will lead to more efficient ram pressure stripping and tidal effects should be stronger . indeed , observations of  in abell  2029 failed to detect emission - line galaxies projected within 600  kpc of the center of the cluster , with the exception of a background galaxy , whereas two - thirds of the galaxies located outside this radius were detected ( dale & uson  2000 ) .",
    "it is well established that galaxies in clusters tend to be deficient in their neutral hydrogen ( ) emission ( e.g.  haynes , giovanelli & chincarini  1984 ) .",
    "more recently , solanes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyzed a sample of 1900  galaxies in the fields of eighteen nearby clusters ( @xmath7 ) and found that deficient galaxies are more likely located near the cluster cores .",
    "this trend holds true in abell  2670 , which is one of the most distant clusters to be imaged in neutral hydrogen ( @xmath8 , van gorkom  1996 ) .",
    "a truly extreme case is that of abell  2029 which is at the same redshift as abell  2670 but in which a deeper search for  by one of us ( jmu ) resulted in an order of magnitude lower detection rate .",
    "deficiency in cluster galaxies is usually attributed to ram pressure stripping : as galaxies approach the central regions of clusters at a speed @xmath9 , they experience a strong interstellar - gas  intracluster - gas interaction which is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "this interaction is likely to induce a burst of star formation and subsequently strip away most of the the remaining galactic interstellar gas ( fujita  1998 ; fujita & nagashima  1999 ; balogh et al .",
    "1999 ; quilis , moore & bower  2000 ) .",
    "new results from the sloan digital sky survey show cluster effects that can not be reconciled by the morphology - density relation alone . using a volume - limited sample of 8598 galaxies with @xmath11 , gomez et al .",

    "( 2001 ) found support for this galaxy - cluster interaction scenario in the normalized radial extent of emission in cluster spiral galaxies : it increases 4@xmath132% per mpc of ( projected ) separation of the galaxy from the cluster - core .",
    "analysis of the kinematical asymmetries of the galaxies also shows a trend with cluster - centric distance  rotation curve asymmetry is greater by a factor of two for inner cluster early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "these two results lead these authors to claim that _ `` such trends are consistent with spiral disk perturbations or even the stripping of the diffuse , outermost gaseous regions within the disks as galaxies pass through the dense cluster cores '' _ ( dale et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "are such observables different in @xmath14 clusters ?",
    "are they different for richer , more x - ray luminous clusters , thus solidifying the interpretation that the intracluster environment can significantly impact galaxy evolution in clusters ? in an effort to explore the tully - fisher relation at @xmath5 , we have undertaken a new imaging and spectroscopic campaign of four rich abell clusters : abell  1413 , abell  2029 , abell  2218 , and abell  2670 .",
    "results from the first cluster surveyed , abell  2029 , were presented in dale & uson  ( 2000 ) . here , we present a full analysis of the data for all four clusters . we also include results from abell  2295 , the only @xmath8 cluster observed in the dale et al .",

    "our sample consists of four abell clusters that are among the densest and richest in the abell catalog , thus providing good laboratories in which to study the effects of the intracluster medium and a fifth one ( abell  2295 ) of similar redshift but much lower richness ( table  [ tab : cluster_sample ] ) .",
    "we first discuss the three clusters for which new data have been obtained , and then the two clusters for which our data have already been published .",
    "* abell  1413 * : abell 1413 is a spiral rich cluster which harbors a dense core of galaxies and an extremely large cd galaxy at the bottom of the cluster potential well .",

    "the average redshift is c@xmath16  based on 9 measurements , and the velocity dispersion is @xmath17  ( after correction for the cosmological broadening ) , which is highly uncertain given the small number of redshifts available for this cluster .",
    "abell ( 1958 ) estimated its distance to be larger than it has turned out to be , because the stripping of the outer envelopes of its galaxies due to their presumed evolution in the dense environment of this cluster has resulted in a fainter magnitude for the tenth - ranked galaxy , used by abell to assign distances and counting radii .",
    "given its redshift , dressler  ( 1978 ) repeated the `` abell count '' and upgraded its richness to 4.5 ( abell estimated @xmath18 ) .",
    "a similar increase in the richness of abell  2029 and abell  2218 is noted below , as is a decrease in the derived richness of abell  2670 .",
    "bad weather severely limited our data collection on abell  1413 .",

    "we used the redshifts available in ned to compute a velocity dispersion @xmath24  which seemed too high .",
    "indeed , we have found that a number of the redshifts that appear in ned are not the standard c@xmath25 , but are instead the relative velocities that would result in the measured spectra in a laboratory experiment ; i.e. , deduced using the special - relativistic doppler expression , although this was not stated in the original reference ( ziegler et al .",
    "the expression for the special - relativistic doppler effect should not be used over cosmological distances , because even if the universe was `` flat '' it would only be so in one ( comoving ) time slice .",
    "space - time is curved and relative velocities are ill - defined over cosmological distances .",

    "it has been noted that the cluster shows significant substructure and might still be merging ( bird  1994 ) . a deep vla study of abell  2670 detected @xmath3230  sources , although none is located near the cluster core ( van gorkom  1996 ) . emission line spectroscopy in the relatively -rich abell  2670 provides an important contrast to similar work in -poor abell  2029 .    * abell  2029 * : abell  2029 is one of the densest and richest clusters in the abell catalog .",
    "the cluster is a textbook example of a compact , relaxed , cd  cluster with high intracluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "the cd  galaxy is one of the largest galaxies known , with low surface brightness emission detected out to a radius of 0.9  mpc ( uson , boughn & kuhn  1991 ) .",

    "the spectroscopic observing strategy usually began with a 10 to 15  minute test exposure on each target .",
    "this allowed an estimate of the exposure time required in order to adequately sample the outer disk regions .",
    "furthermore , the test exposure determined whether the galaxy was even useful for our purposes : a galaxy may lie in the foreground or background of the cluster or it may contain little or no  emission .",
    "if the galaxy was deemed useful , a sequence of follow - up exposures were taken , with each integration typically 15 to 30  minutes in duration .",

    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : distribution ] above , it seems that a large fraction of the galaxies located near the centers of these clusters shows no emission lines , suggesting that passage through the cores might have stripped the galaxies of most of their gas rather than just trimming its spatial extent .",
    "the 2df cluster data confirmed that  equivalent width ( a proxy for the star formation rate ) decreases with decreasing projected cluster - centric distance , and is not entirely due to morphological segregation in clusters ( lewis et al .",

    "( 1997 ) .    the data in the righthand panel of figure  [ fig : tf ] are additionally corrected for cluster population incompleteness bias . in short , because magnitude - limited imaging preferentially samples the brighter end of the cluster luminosity function , the observed tully - fisher slope is artificially too shallow and the zero point overluminous . to remove this effect on the zero point ,",
    "monte carlo simulations have been performed to recover an effective true `` parent population , '' given the observed sample and the scatter in the tully - fisher relation ( dale et al .",
    "in addition , samples of nearby clusters can better probe the tully - fisher slope : a wide dynamic range ( of rotational velocity widths ) is more easily observed in a nearby sample ; owing to the relative propinquity of the giovanelli et al .",

    "calculated with respect to the @xmath5 tully - fisher zero point , the inferred peculiar motion for abell  2218 is large . alternatively , assuming that abell  2218 is at rest with respect to the cosmic background radiation leads to a slightly fainter zero point in the tully - fisher relation at @xmath91 , about @xmath92  mag .",
    "however , this is only a @xmath93 effect , and is thus not significant at this point .",
    "the goal of this survey is to investigate the impact that the intracluster medium has on galaxies residing in a range of cluster environments at @xmath94 .",
    "a total of 156  galaxies were observed spectroscopically in five clusters ranging from rich , x - ray luminous systems to richness class  0 clusters undetected in x - rays . about half of the sample ( 45% )",
    "was detected in .",
    "we observe no significant trend in the extent of  emission as a function of cluster - centric distance .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to what is observed in the nearby cluster sample , particularly when the projected cluster - centric distance is expressed in units of @xmath66 .",
    "we also fail to detect significant trends in rotation curve asymmetry , @xmath43 band tully - fisher residuals , rotation curve shape , and  equivalent width . the relatively small number of rotation curves obtained for the dense clusters might be the main reason for our inability to detect statistically significant trends with cluster richness or location within the clusters . however , it is also possible that the low detection rate is a consequence of ram pressure stripping of the galaxies as they traverse the cores of the clusters , so that the galaxies that we do detect in  would have avoided the cluster cores irrespective of their projected cluster - centric separation . indeed , a vla study of abell  2670 found @xmath95  sources , but _",
    "none _ within 0.5  mpc of the cluster center ( van gorkom  1996 ) .",
    "but a deep vla survey of abell  2029 , sensitive to a 5@xmath6  mass of @xmath96  m@xmath97 within 1.5  mpc of the cluster center , has detected only three sources ( uson , in preparation ) .",
    "there is a clear difference in the cluster - centric distribution of actively star - forming and quiescent galaxies , with the star - forming galaxies preferentially found more in the cluster peripheries .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising , given that the well - known cluster morphology - density relation likely contributes to this effect .",
    "although ground - based imaging precluded perfect sample selection , we strived to only observe spiral galaxies . moreover , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : env ] , our sample selection appears to have been skewed towards late - type spirals near the cluster cores .",
    "thus , if the morphology - density relation has contributed to our observed distribution of strong and weak  emitters , our sample selection seems to have minimized its impact .    the zero - point in the @xmath5 @xmath43 band",
    "tully - fisher relation ( equation  [ eq : tfhighz ] ) is a bit fainter ( by 1.5@xmath6 ) than that observed for nearby clusters ( equation  [ eq : tflowz ] ) . the data for abell  2218 , even more distant at @xmath19 , are an additional 1.8@xmath6 fainter than the @xmath5 template .",
    "are these discrepancies related to the comparatively high redshift of the clusters ?",
    "is this discrepancy evidence of evolution or observational biases ? it is unclear whether or not the difference is due to systematic effects in the observational program : though seeing effects push deprojected rotational velocity widths to artificially high values , `` slit smearing '' of the disk rotation profile conversely biases the widths low . in case",
    "the correction recipes applied are unfit at this relatively high redshift , the simulations and empirical prescriptions used to generate the correction recipes have been revisited .",
    "for example , dale et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have calibrated the effects of seeing on the inferred inclinations .",
    "they found a linear relation between the circularization of isophotes and the ratio of the seeing full - width half - maximum to face - on disk scale length @xmath98 : _",
    "true/_obs = 1 + 0.118 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the `` intrinsic '' and `` observed '' disk ellipticities . however , they only tested this relation for galaxies observed out to @xmath36 . using a separate technique from that explored in dale et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we are able to both reproduce the seeing correction of dale et al .",
    "( 1997 ) over their sample s @xmath101 redshift range , and find that it is applicable even for galaxies as distant as those in abell  2218 . in the simulations artificial , inclined disk galaxies ( created using mkobjects in the artdata package of iraf )",
    "are progressively smoothed such that they exhibit increasingly circular isophotes .",
    "isophotal ellipses are fit to the simulated galaxies using the same techniques used for the observed galaxies .",
    "the relation first quantified by dale et al .  ( 1997 ) tends to non - linearity only when @xmath98 exceeds 2.0 , and all of the galaxies observed in abell  2218 have this ratio less than 1.8 .",
    "both the total and intrinsic scatter of the @xmath43 band tully - fisher relation at @xmath14 are similar to that in nearby clusters .",
    "the total scatter is comparable to that found in giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and dale et al .",
    "( 1999 ) : 0.35 and 0.38 mag , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the tully - fisher relation is the portion that can not be reconciled by measurement uncertainties .",
    "this parameter presumably reflects the various feedback mechanisms and range of parameter space involved in galaxy formation .",
    "andersen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that perhaps up to half of the intrinsic scatter can be accounted for if disk galaxies simply have an average inherent ellipticity of 0.05 , a value they find for their sample of seven nearly face - on spiral galaxies .",
    "compared to the @xmath102  mag intrinsic scatter found by dale et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in clusters at lower redshifts , there is no significant difference in the intrinsic @xmath43  band tully - fisher scatter in these four clusters at @xmath5 . in short ,",
