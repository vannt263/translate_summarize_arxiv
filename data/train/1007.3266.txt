    "<S> the mutual cs term opens up mass gaps for both @xmath66 and @xmath71 gauge fluctuations@xcite : @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the real time ( minkowski spacetime ) equations of motion ( with source term @xmath76 ) become @xmath77 where the last term is the @xmath65-boson current @xmath78 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> these equations of motion indicate that one flux quanta of @xmath71(@xmath66 ) carries two units of @xmath66(@xmath71 ) gauge charge </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath6-spinon sees the @xmath65-boson as a @xmath79-flux and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> these are the two gapped fundamental excitations in a @xmath0 gauge theory : gauge charge and vison , and they are dual degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> if we define the @xmath6-spinon ( @xmath65-boson ) as the @xmath0 gauge charge , @xmath65-boson(@xmath6-spinon ) will be the vison . from the viewpoint of @xmath6-spinons </S>",
    "<S> , we just showed that their visons , _ </S>",

    "<S> . in @xmath41 ordered phase ( caf phase ) , where @xmath66 is higgsed out , the @xmath71 monopole is bound with a spin flip due to the qsh effect . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath71 monopole events are suppressed in the caf phase by spin rotation symmetry and @xmath71 stays in coulomb phase . </S>",
    "<S> however in the @xmath41 disordered phase , there is no qsh effect and monopole events of both @xmath71 and @xmath66 are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote their monopole creation operators as @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> what are the physical consequences of these monopole events ?    by equations of motion </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that an @xmath71 monopole creates 2 units of @xmath66 gauge charge , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> thus such monopole events simply mean that @xmath82 and @xmath83 pairing terms exist in the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> these pairing terms , or monopole events , break the @xmath18 gauge symmetry down to @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> we should focus on one set of dual variables @xmath6(@xmath84 ) and @xmath65(@xmath85 ) to write down the effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> first take a look at the @xmath81 operator : what is the symmetry of the corresponding @xmath6-spinon pairing term ? </S>",
    "<S> the quantum number of this monopole operator is determined by the wzw term : a skyrmion of @xmath41 carries an s - wave pair of @xmath6-spinon . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we showed that @xmath41 disordered phase is nothing but the sps , whose mean - field ansatz is given in eq.([eq : sps_mf ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition from sps to caf phase is described by @xmath65-boson condensation in eq.([eq : eff_lag ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> but due to the topological berry s phase , this is a rather `` high - energy '' description of the criticality . to find a low energy description without topological terms , we should resort to another formulation as shown in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> * duality between schwinger - fermion and schwinger - boson representations *    in this section we focus on the dual variables of @xmath6-spinons : the @xmath65-bosons . </S>",

    "<S> is naturally presented as a higgs condensation of @xmath65-bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> first we need to represent the order parameters of the caf phase in terms of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the qsh order is @xmath86 , but what is the neel order parameter ? </S>",
    "<S> neel order in caf phase corresponds to the monopole of @xmath71 , namely a pairing of @xmath65-boson . </S>",
    "<S> there are two spin-1 bosonic pairing order parameters satisfying this requirement , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e.  _ the real and imaginary part of @xmath87 : @xmath88 it is easy to verify that @xmath89 , so there are only two independent vectorial order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the issue is , which one is the neel order parameter @xmath42 : @xmath90 or @xmath91 ?    a @xmath18 gauge transformation @xmath92 generates a rotation in the @xmath93 plane . by fixing a proper gauge </S>",
    "<S> , we can always choose @xmath90 as the neel order . </S>",
    "<S> we will work within this gauge @xmath94 throughout the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> such a gauge fixing breaks the @xmath18 gauge redundancy down to @xmath0 : @xmath95 .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical symmetries of the qsh ( or vector spin chirality ) and the neel order parameters completely determine the transformation rules of the @xmath65-boson up to a @xmath0 gauge redundancy : @xmath96 where time - reversal transformation @xmath46 is anti - unitary . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why there are no further arbitrariness on the transformation rules of @xmath65 can be easily understood by the following construction . </S>",
    "<S> if we write @xmath65-boson as an su(2 ) matrix : @xmath97 then the most general @xmath1 transformation leaving @xmath64 is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are both @xmath2 rotations ( @xmath99 is spin rotation ) , and @xmath101 . in this representation , the vectors @xmath102 are the 1st , 2nd and 3rd columns of a 3 by 3 rotation matrix @xmath103:@xcite @xmath104 clearly , to leave @xmath103 invariant , the transformations @xmath105 must be @xmath106 .    these symmetry transformation rules allow us to reveal the connection between the sps state here and the 0-flux state in the schwinger - boson representation obtained by wang@xcite . in wang s work , the neel order is represented by the @xmath24-boson as @xmath107 in the effective theory . from eq.([eq : rab ] ) , we can easily construct the duality transformation between the @xmath65-boson and @xmath24-boson representations : @xmath108 , @xmath109 , namely : @xmath110 under duality transformation : @xmath111=z^{\\dagger}\\vec \\sigma z,\\notag\\\\ \\hat n&=w^{\\dagger}\\vec </S>",
    "<S> \\sigma w=-\\mbox{re}[(i\\sigma_yz^{*})^{\\dagger}\\vec \\sigma z].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq.([eq : sym]),([eq : duality ] ) , we can obtain transformation rules of @xmath24-bosons : @xmath112 which are exactly the transformation rules found by wang@xcite for 0-flux state up to a @xmath0 gauge arbitrariness . </S>",
    "<S> this explicitly confirms that the @xmath24-bosons constructed in eq.([eq : duality ] ) are the same @xmath24-bosons discussed by wang , and the sps phase here is identical to the 0-flux phase in schwinger - boson description .    </S>",
    "<S> following the discussion in ref .  , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath116 is the higgs coupling which reduces the @xmath18 gauge degrees of freedom in the @xmath24-boson formulation down to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath117,@xmath118 , and @xmath119 as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath116 is irrelevant , therefore we have an @xmath1 critical point between the caf ( @xmath24-condensed ) phase and the sps ( @xmath24-gapped ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior of this transition is well - studied@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion * in this study , our main prediction is the caf phase . unlike the usual af phase , caf phase has two order parameters : neel @xmath42 and qsh @xmath41 . as caf phase is very likely to be the magnetic ordered phase adjacent to the spin liquid phase found in the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice , in the following we propose an explicit numerical methods to detect the caf phase .    </S>",
    "<S> one can directly measure the qsh order by @xmath121 correlation function , or the vectorial spin chirality correlation function @xmath122 . because qsh order is odd under @xmath123 , </S>",
    "<S> while pure neel order is @xmath123 even , one does not expect a long range correlation of qsh order in a usual af phase . </S>",
    "<S> thus the long range qsh correlation function is an intrinsic signature of the caf phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one can show that the qsh direction is normal to the neel direction . </S>",
