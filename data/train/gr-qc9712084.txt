    "in 1987 christodoulou , who was then ( and still is ) studying the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar model analytically @xcite suggested to matt choptuik , who was investigating the same system numerically , the following question @xcite : consider a generic smooth one - parameter family of initial data , such that for large values of the parameter @xmath0 a black hole is formed , and no black hole is formed for small @xmath0 . if one makes a bisection search for the critical value @xmath1 where a black hole is just formed , does it have finite or infinitesimal mass ? after developing advanced numerical methods for this purpose , choptuik managed to give highly convincing numerical evidence that the mass is infinitesimal .",
    "moreover he found two totally unexpected phenomena : the first is the now famous scaling relation @xmath2 for the black hole mass @xmath3 in the limit @xmath4 ( but @xmath5 ) , where the constant @xmath6 is the same for all such one - parameter families .",
    "( choptuik found @xmath7 . )",
    "the second is the appearance of a highly complicated , scale - periodic solution for @xmath8 , which is again the same for all initial data as long as they are near the limit of black hole formation .",
    "the logarithmic scale period of this solution , @xmath9 , is a second dimensionless number coming out of the blue .",
    "until then most relativists would have assigned numerical work the role of providing quantitative details of phenomena that were already understood qualitatively , noticeably in astrophysical applications . here , numerical relativity provided an important qualitative input into mathematical relativity and gave rise to a new research field .",
    "similar phenomena to choptuik s results were quickly found in other systems too , suggesting that they were limited neither to scalar field matter nor to spherical symmetry .",
    "many researchers were intrigued by the appearance of a complicated `` echoing '' structure , and the two mysterious dimensionless numbers , in the critical solution .",
    "later it was realized that critical phenomena also provide a natural route to naked singularities , and this has linked critical phenomena to the mainstream of research in mathematical relativity .",
    "purely analytical approaches , however , have not been successful so far , and most of what is understood in critical phenomena is based on a mixture of analytical and numerical work .",
    "scale - invariance , universality and power - law behavior suggest the name critical phenomena . a connection with the renormalisation group in partial differential equations has been established in hindsight , but has not yet provided fresh input .",
    "the connection with the renormalisation group in statistical mechanics is even more tenuous , limited to approximate scale invariance , but not extending to the presence of a statistical ensemble .    in our presentation",
    "we combine a phenomenological with a systematic approach . in order to give the reader not familiar with choptuik s work",
    "a flavor of how complicated phenomena arise from innocent - looking pdes , we describe his results in some detail , followed by a review of the work of coleman and evans on critical phenomena in perfect fluid collapse , which appeared a year later .",
    "( the important paper of abrahams and evans , historically the first paper after choptuik s , is reviewed in the context of non - spherically symmetric systems . )    after this phenomenological opening , we systematically explain the key features echoing , universality and scaling in a coherent scenario which has emerged over time , with key terminology borrowed from dynamical systems and renormalisation group theory .",
    "this picture is partly qualitative , but has been underpinned by successful semi - analytic calculations of choptuik s ( and other ) critical solutions and the critical exponent @xmath6 to high precision .",
    "semi - analytic here means that although an analytic solution is impossible , the numerical work solves a simplified problem , for example reducing a pde to an ode . in this context we introduce the relativistic notions of scale - invariance and scale - periodicity , define the concept of a critical solution , and sketch the calculation of the critical exponent .    in the following section we present extensions of this basic scenario .",
    "this presentation is again systematic , but to also give the phenomenological point of view , the section starts with a tabular overview of the matter models in which critical phenomena have been studied so far .",
    "extensions of the basic scenario include more realistic matter models , critical phenomena with a mass gap , the study of the global structure of the critical spacetime itself , and black holes with charge and mass .    in a final section that could be titled `` loose ends ''",
    ", we group together approaches to the problem that have failed or are as yet at a more speculative stage .",
    "this section also reviews some detailed work on the quantum aspects of critical collapse , based on various toy models of semiclassical gravity .",
    "previous short review papers include horne @xcite , bizo @xcite and gundlach @xcite .",
    "choptuik is preparing a longer review paper @xcite . for an interesting general review of the physics of scale - invariance ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the system in which christodoulou and choptuik studied gravitational collapse in detail was the spherically symmetric massless , minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "it has the advantage of simplicity , and the scalar radiation propagating at the speed of light mimics gravitational waves within spherical symmetry .",
    "the einstein equations are @xmath10 and the matter equation is @xmath11 note that the matter equation of motion is contained within the contracted bianchi identities .",
    "choptuik chose schwarzschild - like coordinates @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the metric on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "this choice of coordinates is defined by the radius @xmath14 giving the surface of 2-spheres as @xmath15 , and by @xmath16 being orthogonal to @xmath14 .",
    "one more condition is required to fix the coordinate completely .",
    "choptuik chose @xmath17 at @xmath18 , so that @xmath16 is the proper time of the central observer .    in the auxiliary variables",
    "@xmath19 the wave equation becomes a first - order system , @xmath20 in spherical symmetry there are four algebraically independent components of the einstein equations . of these",
    ", one is proportional to derivatives of the other and can be disregarded .",
    "the other three contain only first derivatives of the metric , namely @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "choptuik chose to use the equations giving @xmath22 and @xmath23 for his numerical scheme , so that only the scalar field is evolved , but the two metric coefficients are calculated from the matter at each new time step .",
    "( the main advantage of such a numerical scheme is its stability . )",
    "these two equations are @xmath24 and they are , respectively , the hamiltonian constraint and the slicing condition .",
    "these four first - order equations totally describe the system . for completeness",
    ", we also give the remaining einstein equation , @xmath25    the free data for the system are the two functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( in spherical symmetry , there are no physical degrees of freedom in the gravitational field . )",
    "choptuik investigated many one - parameter families of such data by evolving the data for many values each of the parameter , say @xmath0 .",
    "simple examples of such families are @xmath28 and a gaussian for @xmath26 , with the parameter @xmath0 taken to be either the amplitude of the gaussian , with the width and center fixed , or the width , with position and amplitude fixed , or the position , with width and amplitude fixed .",
    "it is plausible that for the amplitude sufficiently small , with width and center fixed , the scalar field will disperse , and for sufficiently large amplitude will form a black hole , with similar behavior for many generic parameters .",
    "this is difficult to prove in generality .",
    "christodoulou showed for the spherically symmetric scalar field system that data sufficiently weak in a well - defined way evolve to a minkowski - like spacetime @xcite , and that a class of sufficiently strong data forms a black hole @xcite .",
    "but what happens in between ?",
    "choptuik found that in all families of initial data he could make arbitrarily small black holes by fine - tuning the parameter @xmath0 close to the black hole threshold .",
    "an important fact is that there is nothing visibly special to the black hole threshold .",
    "one can not tell that one given data set will form a black hole and another one infinitesimally close will not , short of evolving both for a sufficiently long time .",
    "fine - tuning is then a heuristic procedure , and effectively proceeds by bisection : starting with two data sets one of which forms a black hole , try a third one in between along some one - parameter family linking the two , drop one of the old sets and repeat .    with @xmath0",
    "closer to @xmath1 , the spacetime varies on ever smaller scales .",
    "the only limit was numerical resolution , and in order to push that limitation further away , choptuik developed special numerical techniques that recursively refine the numerical grid in spacetime regions where details arise on scales too small to be resolved properly . in the end , choptuik could determine @xmath1 up to a relative precision of @xmath29 , and make black holes as small as @xmath30 times the adm mass of the spacetime .",
    "the power - law scaling ( [ power_law ] ) was obeyed from those smallest masses up to black hole masses of , for some families , @xmath31 of the adm mass , that is , over six orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "there were no families of initial data which did not show the universal critical solution and critical exponent .",
    "choptuik therefore conjectured that @xmath6 is the same for all one - parameter families , and that the approximate scaling law holds ever better for arbitrarily small @xmath32 .",
    "i would suggest reformulating this conjecture in a different manner .",
    "let us first consider a finite - dimensional subspace of the space of initial data , with coordinates @xmath33 on it .",
    "the subspace of gaussian data for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 for example is 6-dimensional .",
    "we could choose the amplitudes , centers and widths of the two gaussians as coordinates , but any six smooth functions of these could also serve as coordinates .",
    "various one - parameter families only serve as probes of this one 6-dimensional space .",
    "they indicate that there is a smooth hypersurface in this space which divides black hole from non - black hole data .",
    "let @xmath36 be any smooth coordinate function on the space so that @xmath37 is the black hole threshold .",
    "then , for any choice of @xmath36 , there is a second smooth function @xmath38 on the space so that the black hole mass as a function of the space is given as @xmath39 in words , the entire unsmoothness at the black hole threshold is captured by the one critical exponent .",
    "one can now formally go over from a finite - dimensional subspace to the infinite - dimensional space of initial data .",
    "note that @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be square - integrable for the spacetime to be asymptotically flat , and therefore the initial data space has a countable basis . in this view , it is difficult to see how different one - parameter families could have different values of @xmath6 .",
    "it also shows that the critical exponent is not an effect of a bad parameterization .",
    "clearly a collapse spacetime which has adm mass 1 , but settles down to a black hole of mass ( for example ) @xmath30 has to show structure on very different scales .",
    "the same is true for a spacetime which is as close to the black hole threshold , but on the other side : the scalar wave contracts until curvature values of order @xmath40 are reached in a spacetime region of size @xmath30 before it starts to disperse .",
    "choptuik found that all near - critical spacetimes , for all families of initial data , look the same in an intermediate region , that is they approximate one universal spacetime , which is also called the critical solution .",
    "this spacetime is scale - periodic in the sense that there is a value @xmath41 of @xmath16 such that when we shift the origin of @xmath16 to @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 for all integer @xmath43 and for @xmath9 , and where @xmath44 stands for any one of @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 ( and therefore also for @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) .",
    "the accumulation point @xmath41 depends on the family , but the scale - periodic part of the near - critical solutions does not .",
    "this result is sufficiently surprising to formulate it once more in a slightly different manner .",
    "let us replace @xmath14 and @xmath16 by a pair of auxiliary variables such that one of them retains a dimension , while the other is dimensionless .",
    "a simple example is ( after shifting the origin of @xmath16 to @xmath41 ) @xmath50 ( as a matter of convention , @xmath16 has been assumed negative so that it increases towards the accumulation point at @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , @xmath52 has been defined so that it increases with increasing @xmath16 . )",
    "choptuik s observation , expressed in these coordinates , is that in any near - critical solution there is a space - time region where the fields @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are well approximated by their values in a universal solution , as @xmath53 where the fields @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the critical solution have the property @xmath57 the dimensionful constants @xmath41 and @xmath58 depend on the one - parameter family of solutions , but the dimensionless critical fields @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and in particular their dimensionless period @xmath59 , are universal .",
    "a slightly supercritical and a slightly subcritical solution from the same family ( so that @xmath58 and @xmath41 are the same ) are practically indistinguishable until they have reached a very small scale where the one forms an apparent horizon , while the other starts dispersing .",
    "not surprisingly , this scale is the same as that of the black hole ( if one is formed ) , and so we have for the range @xmath60 of @xmath52 on which a near - critical solution approximates the universal one @xmath61 and for the number @xmath62 of scaling `` echos '' that are seen , @xmath63 note that this holds for both supercritical and subcritical solutions .",
    "choptuik s results have been repeated by a number of other authors .",
    "gundlach , price and pullin @xcite could verify the mass scaling law with a relatively simple code , due to the fact that it holds even quite far from criticality .",
    "garfinkle @xcite used the fact that recursive grid refinement in near - critical solutions is not required in arbitrary places , but that all refined grids are centered on @xmath64 , in order to simulate a simple kind of mesh refinement on a single grid in double null coordinates : @xmath65 grid lines accumulate at @xmath66 , and @xmath67 lines at @xmath68 , with @xmath69 chosen to coincide with @xmath64 .",
    "hamad and stewart @xcite have written a complete mesh refinement algorithm based on a double null grid ( but coordinates @xmath65 and @xmath14 ) , and report even higher resolution than choptuik .",
    "their coordinate choice also allowed them to follow the evolution beyond the formation of an apparent horizon .",
    "the scale - periodicity , or echoing , of the scalar field critical solution was a new phenomenon in general relativity , and initial efforts at understanding concentrated there .",
    "evans however realized that scale - echoing was only a more complicated form of scale - invariance , that the latter was the key to the problem , and moreover that it could be expected to arise in a different matter model , namely a perfect fluid .",
    "evans knew that scale - invariant , or self - similar , solutions arise in fluid dynamics problems ( without gravity ) when there are two very different scales in the initial problem ( for example an explosion with high initial density into a thin surrounding fluid @xcite ) , and that such solutions play the role of an intermediate asymptotic in the intermediate density regime @xcite .",
    "evans and coleman @xcite therefore made a perfect fluid ansatz for the matter , @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the 4-velocity , @xmath72 the density and @xmath0 the pressure .",
    "as for the scalar field , the matter equations of motion are equivalent to the conservation of matter energy - momentum .",
    "the only equation of state without an intrinsic scale is @xmath73 , with @xmath74 a constant .",
    "this was desirable in order to allow for a scale - invariant solution like that of choptuik .",
    "evans and coleman chose @xmath75 because it is the equation of state of radiation ( or ultra - relativistic hot matter ) .",
    "they made the same coordinate choice in spherical symmetry as choptuik , and evolved one - parameter families of initial data .",
    "they found a universal intermediate attractor , and power - law scaling of the black hole mass , with a universal critical exponent of @xmath76 .",
    "( to anticipate , the coincidence of the value with that for the scalar field is now believed to be accidental . )",
    "the main difference was that the universal solution is not scale - periodic but scale - invariant : it has the continuous symmetry ( after shifting the origin of @xmath16 to @xmath41 ) @xmath77 where @xmath44 now stands for the metric coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( as in the scalar field case ) and the dimensionless matter variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we shall discuss this symmetry in more detail below .",
    "independently , evans and coleman made a scale - invariant ansatz for the critical solution , which transforms the pde problem in @xmath16 and @xmath14 into an ode problem in the one independent variable @xmath80 .",
    "they then posed a nonlinear boundary value problem by demanding regularity at the center @xmath81 and at the past sound cone @xmath82 of the point @xmath83 , where a generic self - similar solution would be singular .",
    "the sound cone referred to here and below is a characteristic of the matter equations of motion .",
    "it is made up of the characteristic curves which are also homothetic curves ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the past _ light _ cone of @xmath83 plays no role in the spherically symmetric perfect fluid critical solution because in spherical symmetry there are no propagating gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "it does play a role in the spherically symmetric scalar field critical solutions however , because there it is also characteristic of the scalar field matter .",
    "the regularity condition at the center @xmath81 is local flatness , or @xmath85 in the coordinates ( [ tr_metric ] ) .",
    "the regularity condition at @xmath82 is the absence of a shock wave .",
    "i believe that both conditions are equivalent to demanding analyticity , and that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are `` regular singular points '' of the ode system , although this remains to be shown by a suitable change of variables .",
    "the solutions of this boundary value problem form a discrete family .",
    "the simplest solution of the boundary value problem coincides perfectly with the intermediate asymptotic that is found in the collapse simulations , arising from generic data .",
    "it is really this coincidence that justifies the boundary value problem posed by evans and coleman . at an intuitive level , however , one could argue that the critical solution should be smooth because it arises as an intermediate asymptotic from smooth initial data . in a contrasting opinion , carr and henriksen @xcite",
    "claim that the perfect fluid critical solution should obey a certain global condition ( the `` particle horizon '' and the `` event horizon '' of the spacetime coincide ) that can be interpreted as the solution being a marginal black hole . in order to impose this condition , they need one more free parameter in the space of css solutions , and obtain it by not imposing analyticity at the past sound cone , where their candidate critical solution has a shock .",
    "evans and coleman also suggested that an analysis of the linear perturbations of the critical solution would give an `` estimate '' of the critical exponents . this program was carried out for the @xmath75 perfect fluid by koike , hara and adachi @xcite and for other values of @xmath74 by maison @xcite , to high precision .",
    "the critical solution found by choptuik @xcite for the spherically symmetric scalar field is scale - periodic , or discretely self - similar ( dss ) , and the critical solution found by evans and coleman @xcite is scale - invariant , or continuously self - similar ( css ) .",
    "we begin with the continuous symmetry because it is simpler . in newtonian physics ,",
    "a solution @xmath44 is self - similar if it is of the form @xmath86\\ ] ] if the function @xmath87 is derived from dimensional considerations alone , one speaks of self - similarity of the first kind .",
    "an example is @xmath88 for the diffusion equation @xmath89 . in more complicated equations ,",
    "the limit of self - similar solutions can be singular , and @xmath87 may contain additional dimensionful constants ( which do not appear in the field equation ) in terms such as @xmath90 , where @xmath46 , called an anomalous dimension , is not determined by dimensional considerations but through the solution of an eigenvalue problem @xcite . for now , we concentrate on self - similarity of the first kind",
    ".    a continuous self - similarity of the spacetime in gr corresponds to the existence of a homothetic vector field @xmath91 , defined by the property @xcite @xmath92 ( this is a special type of conformal killing vector , namely one with constant coefficient on the right - hand side .",
    "the value of this constant coefficient is conventional , and can be set equal to 2 by a constant rescaling of @xmath91 . ) from ( [ homothetic_metric ] ) it follows that @xmath93 and therefore @xmath94 but the inverse does not hold : the riemann tensor and the metric need not satisfy ( [ homothetic_curvature ] ) and ( [ homothetic_metric ] ) if the einstein tensor obeys ( [ homothetic_matter ] ) . if the matter is a perfect fluid ( [ fluid_stress_energy ] ) it follows from ( [ homothetic_metric ] ) , ( [ homothetic_matter ] ) and the einstein equations that @xmath95 similarly ,",
    "if the matter is a free scalar field @xmath47 ( [ scalar_stress_energy ] ) , it follows that @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant .    in coordinates",
    "@xmath98 adapted to the homothety , the metric coefficients are of the form @xmath99 where the coordinate @xmath52 is the negative logarithm of a spacetime scale , and the remaining three coordinates @xmath100 are dimensionless . in these coordinates ,",
    "the homothetic vector field is @xmath101 the minus sign in both equations ( [ css_coordinates ] ) and ( [ xi_in_coordinates ] ) is a convention we have chosen so that @xmath52 increases towards smaller spacetime scales . for the critical solutions of gravitational collapse , we shall later choose surfaces of constant @xmath52 to be spacelike ( although this is not possible globally ) , so that @xmath52 is the time coordinate as well as the scale coordinate .",
    "then it is natural that @xmath52 increases towards the future , that is towards smaller scales .    as an illustration , the css scalar field in these coordinates",
    "would be @xmath102 with @xmath97 a constant .",
    "the generalization to a discrete self - similarity is obvious in these coordinates , and was made in @xcite : @xmath103 the conformal metric @xmath104 does now depend on @xmath52 , but only in a periodic manner . like the continuous symmetry",
    ", the discrete version has a geometric formulation @xcite : a spacetime is discretely self - similar if there exists a discrete diffeomorphism @xmath34 and a real constant @xmath59 such that @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the pull - back of @xmath107 under the diffeomorphism @xmath34 .",
    "this is our definition of discrete self - similarity ( dss ) .",
    "it can be obtained formally from ( [ homothetic_metric ] ) by integration along @xmath91 over an interval @xmath59 of the affine parameter . nevertheless , the definition is independent of any particular vector field @xmath91 .",
    "one simple coordinate transformation that brings the schwarzschild - like coordinates ( [ tr_metric ] ) into this form , with the periodicity in @xmath52 equivalent to the scaling property ( [ tr_scaling ] ) , was given above in eqn .",
    "( [ x_tau ] ) , as one easily verifies by substitution .",
    "the most general ansatz for the massless scalar field compatible with dss is @xmath108 with @xmath97 a constant .",
    "it should be stressed here that the coordinate systems adapted to css ( [ css_coordinates ] ) or dss ( [ dss_coordinates ] ) form large classes , even in spherical symmetry .",
    "one can fix the surface @xmath109 freely , and can introduce any coordinates @xmath100 on it . in particular , in spherical symmetry , @xmath52-surfaces can be chosen to be spacelike , as for example defined by ( [ tr_metric ] ) and ( [ x_tau ] ) above , and in this case the coordinate system can not be global ( in the example , @xmath110 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can find global coordinate systems , where @xmath52-surfaces must become spacelike at large @xmath14 , as in the coordinates ( [ global_css ] ) .",
    "moreover , any such coordinate coordinate system can be continuously deformed into one of the same class .    as an aside",
    ", we mention that self - similarity of the second kind in general relativity was studied by carter and henriksen @xcite and coley @xcite .",
    "the connection with the newtonian definition is that space and time are rescaled in different ways . to make this a covariant notion one needs a preferred timelike congruence .",
    "the 4-velocity @xmath71 of a perfect fluid is a natural candidate .",
    "the metric @xmath107 can then be decomposed into space and time as @xmath111 .",
    "the homothetic scaling ( [ homothetic_metric ] ) is replaced by @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "this kind of self - similarity has not to date been found in critical collapse . in a possible source of confusion ,",
    "evans and coleman @xcite use the term `` self - similarity of the second kind '' , because they define their self - similar coordinate @xmath80 as @xmath114 , with @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless , the spacetime they calculate is homothetic , that is , self - similar of the first kind according to the terminology of carter and henriksen .",

    "here we should mention only that perfect fluid spherically symmetric self - similar solutions have been examined by bogoyavlenskii @xcite , foglizzo and henriksen @xcite , bicknell and henriksen @xcite and ori and piran @xcite .",

    "the einstein equations are reduced to an ode system by the self - similar spherically symmetric ansatz , which is then discussed as a dynamical system .",
    "it is often difficult to regain the spacetime picture from the phase space picture . in particular , it is not clear which solution in these classifications is the critical solution found in perfect fluid collapse simulations , and constructed through a css ansatz , by evans and coleman @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also unclear why the scalar field dss critical solution has @xmath116 in eqn .",

    "the `` evolution '' equation for @xmath181 near @xmath176 then takes the form @xmath182 , while the other three equations are regular .",
    "this format of the equations also demonstrates how to restrict from a dss to a css ansatz : one simply drops the @xmath183-derivatives .",

    "further work on critical collapse far away from spherical symmetry would be desirable , but appears to be held up by numerical difficulty .      a different , and technically simpler , approach is to take a known critical solution in spherical symmetry , and perturb it using nonspherical perturbations .",

    "he finds no growing nonspherical modes at all .",
    "the main significance of this result , even though it is only perturbative , is to establish one critical solution that really has only one unstable perturbation mode within the full phase space .",
    "as the critical solution itself has a naked singularity ( see section [ section_singularity ] ) , this means that there is , for this matter model , a set of initial data of codimension one in the full phase space of general relativity that forms a naked singularity . in hindsight , this result also fully justifies the attention that critical phenomena gravitational collapse have won as a `` natural '' route to naked singularities .",

    "secondly , critical phenomena seem to be generic with respect to matter models , including realistic matter models with intrinsic scales . for a hypothetical experiment to create a planck - sized black hole in the laboratory through a strong explosion",
    ", this would mean that one could fine - tune any one design parameter of the bomb to the black hole threshold , without requiring much control over its detailed effects on the explosion .",
    "the metric of the critical spacetime is of the form @xmath297 times a regular metric . from this general form alone",

    "the weyl tensor with index position @xmath299 is conformally invariant , so that components with this index position remain finite as @xmath300 . in this property",
    "it resembles the initial singularity in penrose s weyl tensor conjecture rather than the final singularity in generic gravitational collapse .",
    "this type of singularity is called `` conformally compactifiable '' @xcite or `` isotropic '' @xcite .",

    "evans and coleman conjectured that the singularity is shrouded in an infinite redshift based on the fact that @xmath46 grows as a small power of @xmath14 at constant @xmath16 .",

    "this in turn means simply that the critical spacetime is not asymptotically flat , but asymptotically conical at spacelike infinity , with the hawking mass proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "hamad and stewart @xcite evolved near - critical scalar field spacetimes on a double null grid , which allowed them to follow the time evolution up to close to the future light cone of the singularity .",

    "the solution can be continued through this point up to @xmath305 .",
    "there it is a mixture of the regular and the singular solution .",
    "we now state this more mathematically .",
    "the ansatz of hirschmann and eardley for the self - similar complex scalar field is ( we slightly adapt their notation ) @xmath306 with @xmath222 a real constant .",
    "near the future light cone they find that @xmath122 is approximately of the form @xmath307 with @xmath308 and @xmath309 regular at @xmath305 , and @xmath204 a small positive constant .",
    "the singular part of the scalar field oscillates an infinite number of times as @xmath310 , but with decaying amplitude .",
    "this means that the scalar field @xmath47 is just differentiable , and that therefore the stress tensor is just continuous .",
    "it is crucial that spacetime is not flat , or else @xmath204 would vanish . for this in turn",
    "it is crucial that the regular part @xmath311 of the solution does not vanish , as one sees from the field equations .",
    "the only other case in which the critical solution has been continued up to the future light cone is choptuik s real scalar field solution @xcite .",
    "let @xmath181 and @xmath312 be the ingoing and outgoing wave degrees of freedom respectively defined in ( [ xpm ] ) . at the future light cone",
    "@xmath305 the solution has the form @xmath313 where @xmath314 is a positive real constant , @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 are regular real functions with period @xmath59 in their second argument , and @xmath204 is a small positive real constant .",
    "( we have again simplified the original notation . ) again , the singular part of the solution oscillates an infinite number of times but with decaying amplitude .",
    "gundlach concludes that the scalar field , the metric coefficients , all their first derivatives , and the riemann tensor exist , but that is as far as differentiability goes .",
    "( not all second derivatives of the metric exist , but enough to construct the riemann tensor . )",
    "if either of the regular parts @xmath315 or @xmath316 vanished , spacetime would be flat , @xmath204 would vanish , and the scalar field itself would be singular . in this sense , gravity regularizes the self - similar matter field ansatz . in the critical solution , it does this perfectly at the past lightcone , but only partly at the future lightcone . perhaps significantly , spacetime is almost flat at the future horizon in both the examples , in the sense that the hawking mass divided by @xmath14 is a very small number , as small as @xmath30 ( but not zero according to numerical work by horne @xcite ) in the spacetime of hirschmann and eardley .    in summary ,",
    "the future light cone ( or cauchy horizon ) of these two critical spacetimes is not a curvature singularity , but it is singular in the sense that differentiability is lower than elsewhere in the solution .",
    "locally , one can continue the solution through the future light cone to an almost flat spacetime ( the solution is of course not unique ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , if such a continuation can have a regular center @xmath18 ( for @xmath140 ) , although this seems to have been assumed by some authors .",
    "a priori , one should expect a conical singularity , with a ( small ) defect angle at @xmath18 .",
    "the results just discussed were hampered by the fact that they are investigations of singular spacetimes that are only known in numerical form , with a limited precision . as an exact toy model we consider an exact spherically symmetric , css solution for massless real scalar field",
    "that was apparently first discovered by roberts @xcite and then re - discovered in the context of critical collapse by brady @xcite and oshiro et al .",

    "one can cut these regions out and replace them by minkowski space , not smoothly of course , but without creating a @xmath324-function in the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the resulting spacetime resembles the critical spacetimes arising in gravitational collapse in some respects : it is self - similar , has a regular center @xmath18 at the past of the curvature singularity @xmath321 and is continuous at the past light cone .",
    "it is also continuous at the future light cone , and the future branch of @xmath18 is again regular .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with the genuine critical solutions that arise as attractors in critical collapse .",
    "they are as regular as the roberts solution ( analytic ) at the past @xmath18 , more regular ( analytic versus continuous ) at the past light cone , as regular ( continuous ) at the future light cone and , it is to be feared , less regular at the future branch of @xmath18 : in contrary to previous claims @xcite there may be no continuation through the future sound or light cone that does not have a conical singularity at the future branch of @xmath18 .",
    "the global structure still needs to be clarified for all known critical solutions .",
    "in summary , the critical spacetimes that arise asymptotically in the fine - tuning of gravitational collapse to the black - hole threshold have a curvature singularity that is visible at infinity with a finite redshift .",
    "the cauchy horizon of the singularity is mildly singular ( low differentiability ) , but the curvature is finite there .",
    "it is unclear at present if the singularity is timelike or if there exists a continuation beyond the cauchy horizon with a regular center , so that the singularity is limited , loosely speaking , to a point .",
    "further work should be able to clarify this . in any case , the singularity is naked and the critical solutions therefore provide counter - examples to some formulations of cosmic censorship which state that naked singularities can not arise from smooth initial data in reasonable matter models .",
    "it is now clear that one must refine this to state that there is no _ open ball _ of smooth initial for naked singularities .",
    "recent analytic work by christodoulou also comes to this conclusion @xcite .",
    "given the scaling power law for the black hole mass in critical collapse , one would like to know what happens if one takes a generic one - parameter family of initial data with both electric charge and angular momentum ( for suitable matter ) , and fine - tunes the parameter @xmath0 to the black hole threshold .",

    "gundlach and martn - garca @xcite have studied scalar massless electrodynamics in spherical symmetry . clearly , the real scalar field critical solution of choptuik is a solution of this system too .",
    "less obviously , it remains a critical solution within massless ( and in fact , massive ) scalar electrodynamics in the sense that it still has only one growing perturbation mode within the enlarged solution space .",
    "some of its perturbations carry electric charge , but as they are all decaying , electric charge is a subdominant effect .",
    "the charge of the black hole in the critical limit is dominated by the most slowly decaying of the charged modes . from this analysis , a universal power - law scaling of the black hole charge @xmath328",
    "was predicted .",
    "the predicted value @xmath329 of the critical exponent ( in scalar electrodynamics ) was subsequently verified in collapse simulations by hod and piran @xcite .",

    "general considerations using dimensional analysis led gundlach and martn - garca to the general prediction that the two critical exponents are always related , for any matter model , by the inequality @xmath330 this has not yet been verified in any other matter model .",
    "gundlach s results on non - spherically symmetric perturbations around spherical critical collapse of a perfect fluid @xcite allow for initial data , and therefore black holes , with infinitesimal angular momentum .",
    "all nonspherical perturbations decrease towards the singularity .",
    "the situation is therefore similar to scalar electrodynamics versus the real scalar field .",
    "the critical solution of the more special model ( here , the strictly spherically symmetric fluid ) is still a critical solution within the more general model ( a slightly nonspherical and slowly rotating fluid ) . in particular , axial perturbations (",

    "the explanation is of course that near the black hole threshold the initial data , including the initial angular momentum , are totally forgotten , while the oscillating angular momentum of the black hole is a subdominant effect .",
    "these results have not yet been tested against numerical collapse simulations .",
    "traschen @xcite has drawn attention to a different possible connection between critical phenomena and black hole charge .",

    "( the test field is coupled via @xmath339 , but its back - reaction on both the metric and the maxwell field is neglected . ) in the limit @xmath340 for the background black hole , and near the horizon this linear equation has a scale - invariance not present in non - extremal black holes because the surface gravity , which otherwise sets a scale , vanishes .",
    "the equation therefore admits self - similar solutions .",
    "traschen suggests these are dss , but there is no argument why either a css or a dss solution should play a special role .",
    "it has been pointed out by argyres @xcite , koike , hara and adachi @xcite and others that the time evolution near the critical solution can be considered as a renormalisation group flow on the space of initial data .",
    "the calculation of the critical exponent in section [ section_scaling ] is in fact mathematically identical with that of the critical exponent governing the correlation length near the critical point in statistical mechanics @xcite , if one identifies the time evolution in the time coordinate @xmath52 and spatial coordinate @xmath80 with the renormalisation group flow .    for simple parabolic or hyperbolic differential equations , a discrete renormalisation ( semi)group acting on their solutions has been defined in the following way @xcite .",

    "in general relativity as in other field theories or in dynamical systems , a solution is determined ( at least locally ) by an initial data set .",
    "( in general relativity , a solution is a spacetime , and the initial data are the first and second fundamental forms of a spacelike hypersurface , plus suitable matter variables . ) a crucial distinctive feature of general relativity , however , is that a solution does not correspond to a unique trajectory in the space of initial data .",
    "this is because a spacetime can be sliced in different ways , and on each slice one can have different coordinate systems .",
    "infinitesimally , this slicing and coordinate freedom is parameterized by the lapse and shift .",
    "they can be set freely , independently of the initial data , and they influence only the coordinates on the spacetime , not the spacetime itself .",
    "what coordinates should one use then when describing a time evolution in gr as a renormalisation group transformation on the space of initial data ? for a given self - similar spacetime , there are preferred coordinates adapted to the symmetry and defined by eqn .",
    "( [ dss_coordinates ] ) .",
    "these are far from unique .",
    "nevertheless , one can choose one of them , and then extend this choice of coordinates to linear perturbations around the self - similar solution .",
    "in this linear regime , one really obtains a time evolution such that a phase space diagram of the type of fig .",
    "1 makes sense : on the limit cycle , the same cauchy data , expressed in the same space coordinates , return periodically .",

    ", no preferred gauge choice is known .",
    "we are then faced with the general question : given initial data in general relativity , is there a prescription for the lapse and shift , such that , if these are in fact data for a self - similar solution , the resulting time evolution actively drives the metric to the special form ( [ dss_coordinates ] ) that explicitly displays the self - similarity ?",
    "if such a prescription existed , one could try to find the non - linear critical solution itself as a fixed point of a renormalisation group transformation , as described by bricmont and kupiainen @xcite for simple pdes .",

    "garfinkle gives an autonomous system of equations for these degrees of freedom ( @xmath354 is traceless ) alone .",

    "in the notation of this review , @xmath16 is then the scale coordinate @xmath52 .",

    "when the scale - invariant variables are periodic in @xmath16 ( independent of @xmath16 ) , the spacetime is discretely ( periodically ) self - similar .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that the converse holds : if we begin with data taken on an arbitrary hypersurface in a self - similar spacetime , garfinkle s evolution will not make his scale - invariant variables periodic in @xmath16 .",
    "this should happen only if the initial data have been collected on the `` right '' initial hypersurface .",

    "it seems necessary to allow for and prescribe a shift if garfinkle s scheme is to be consistent . in this context",
    "it may be relevant that in the split between the scale - invariant and scale part of the einstein equations , the latter accounts only for one degree of freedom .",
    "this seems to indicate that any such split is tied to a slicing of spacetime .",
    "garfinkle suggests that a dynamical explanation of critical phenomena would consist in finding a mechanism of `` dissipation '' that drives the scale - invariant system towards a fixed point or a limit cycle .",

    ", purely analytic approaches have remained surprisingly unsuccessful in dealing with critical collapse .",
    "any real world application of critical phenomena would require that critical phenomena are not an artifact of the simple matter models that have been studied so far , and that they are not an artifact of spherical symmetry .",
    "at present this seems a reasonable hypothesis .",
    "critical collapse still requires a kind of fine - tuning of initial data that does not seem to arise naturally in the astrophysical world .",
    "niemeyer and jedamzik @xcite have suggested a scenario that gives rise to such fine - tuning . in the early universe ,",
    "quantum fluctuations of the metric and matter can be important , for example providing the seeds of galaxy formation . if they are large enough , these fluctuations may even collapse immediately , giving rise to what is called primordial black holes .",
    "large quantum fluctuations are exponentially more unlikely than small ones , @xmath367 , where @xmath324 is the density contrast of the fluctuation .",
    "one would therefore expect the spectrum of primordial black holes to be sharply peaked at the minimal @xmath324 that leads to black hole formation . that is the required fine - tuning . in the presence of fine - tuning ,",

    ", the peak of the primordial black hole spectrum might be expected to be at exponentially smaller values of the black hole mass than expected naively .      as we have seen in the last section , critical phenomena",
    "may provide a natural route from everyday scale down to much smaller scales , perhaps down to the planck scale .",
    "various authors have investigated the relationship of choptuik s critical phenomena to quantum black holes .",
    "it is widely believed that black holes should emit thermal quantum radiation , from considerations of quantum field theory on a fixed schwarzschild background on the one hand , and from the purely classical three laws of black hole mechanics on the other ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "but there is no complete model of the back - reaction of the radiation on the black hole , which should be shrinking . in particular",
    ", it is unknown what happens at the endpoint of evaporation , when full quantum gravity should become important .",
    "it is debated in particular if the information that has fallen into the black hole is eventually recovered in the evaporation process or lost .    to study these issues , various 2-dimensional toy models of gravity coupled to scalar field matter",
    "have been suggested which are more or less directly linked to a spherically symmetric 4-dimensional situation ( see @xcite for a review ) . in two space - time dimensions",
    ", the quantum expectation value of the matter stress tensor can be determined from the trace anomaly alone , together with the reasonable requirement that the quantum stress tensor is conserved .",
    "furthermore , quantizing the matter scalar field(s ) @xmath122 but leaving the metric classical can be formally justified in the limit of many such matter fields .",
    "the two - dimensional gravity used is not the two - dimensional version of einstein gravity but of a scalar - tensor theory of gravity .",

    "a reflecting boundary condition is imposed at a timelike curve in the 2-dimensional spacetime .",
    "this plays the role of the curve @xmath18 in a 2-dimensional reduction of the spherically symmetric 4-dimensional theory .",
    "how does one naively expect a model of semiclassical gravity to behave when the initial data are fine - tuned to the black hole threshold ?",
    "first of all , until the fine - tuning is taken so far that curvatures on the planck scale are reached during the time evolution , universality and scaling should persist , simply because the theory must approximate classical general relativity . approaching the planck scale from above",
    ", one would expect to be able to write down a critical solution that is the classical critical solution asymptotically at large scales , through an ansatz of the form @xmath369 where the scale @xmath58 in @xmath370 is now the planck length .",
    "this ansatz would recursively solve a semiclassical field equation , where powers of @xmath371 ( in coordinates @xmath80 and @xmath52 ) signal the appearances of quantum terms .",
    "note that this is exactly the ansatz ( [ asymptotic_css ] ) , but with the opposite sign in the exponent , so that the higher order terms now become negligible as @xmath372 , that is away from the singularity on large scales . on the planck scale itself , this ansatz would not converge , and self - similarity would break down .    addressing the question from the side of classical general relativity , chiba and siino",
    "@xcite write down their own 2-dimensional toy model , and add a quantum stress tensor that is determined by the trace anomaly and stress - energy conservation .",
    "they note that the quantum stress tensor diverges at @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the additional quantum terms in the field equations carry powers not only of @xmath373 , but instead of @xmath374 .",
    "hence no self - similar ansatz can be regular at the center @xmath18 ( @xmath81 ) even before the singularity appears at @xmath156 .",
    "they conclude that quantum gravity effects preclude critical phenomena on all scales , even far from the planck scale .",
    "more plausibly , their result indicates that this 2-dimensional toy model does not capture essential physics .    at this point ,",
    "ayal and piran @xcite make an ad - hoc modification to the semiclassical equations .",
    "they modify the quantum stress tensor by a function which interpolates between 1 at large @xmath14 , and @xmath375 at small @xmath14 .",
    "the stress tensor would only be conserved if this function was a constant .",
    "the authors justify this modification by pointing out that violation of energy conservation takes place only at the planck scale .",
    "it takes place , however , not only where the solution varies dynamically on the planck scale , but at all times in a planck - sized world tube around the center @xmath18 , even before the solution itself reaches the planck scale dynamically .",
    "this introduces a non - geometric , background structure , effect at the world - line @xmath18 . with this modification , ayal and piran",
    "obtain results in agreement with our expectations set out above . for far supercritical initial data , black formation and subsequent evaporation",
    "are observed . with fine - tuning , as long as the solution stays away from the planck scale , critical solution phenomena including the choptuik universal solution and critical exponent are observed .",
    "( the exponent is measured as @xmath376 , indicating a limited accuracy of the numerical method . ) in an intermediate regime , the quantum effects increase the critical value of the parameters @xmath0 .",
    "this is interpreted as the initial data partly evaporating while they are trying to form a black hole .",
    "researchers coming from the quantum field theory side seem to favor a model ( the rst model ) in which ad hoc `` counter terms '' have been added to make it soluble .",
    "the matter is a conformally rather than minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the field equations are trivial up to an ode for a timelike curve on which reflecting boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the world line of this `` moving mirror '' is not clearly related to @xmath14 in a 4-dimensional spherically symmetric model , but seems to correspond to a finite @xmath14 rather than @xmath18 .",
    "this may explain why the problem of a diverging quantum stress tensor is not encountered .",
    "strominger and thorlacius @xcite find a critical exponent of @xmath365 , but their 2-dimensional situation differs from the 4-dimensional one in many aspects .",
    "classically ( without quantum terms ) any ingoing matter pulse , however weak , forms a black hole . with the quantum terms",
    ", matter must be thrown in sufficiently rapidly to counteract evaporation in order to form a black hole .",
    "the initial data to be fine - tuned are replaced by the infalling energy flux .",
    "there is a threshold value of the energy flux for black hole formation , which is known in closed form .",
    "( recall this is a soluble system . )",
    "the mass of the black hole is defined as the total energy it absorbs during its lifetime .",
    "this black hole mass is given by @xmath377 where @xmath324 is the difference between the peak value of the flux and the threshold value , and @xmath46 is the quadratic order coefficient in a taylor expansion in advanced time of the flux around its peak .",
    "there is universality with respect to different shapes of the infalling flux in the sense that only the zeroth and second order taylor coefficients matter .",
    "peleg , bose and parker @xcite study the so - called cghs 2-dimensional model .",
    "this ( non - soluble ) model does allow for a study of critical phenomena with quantum effects turned off .",
    "again , numerical work is limited to integrating an ode for the mirror world line .",
    "numerically , the authors find black hole mass scaling with a critical exponent of @xmath378 .",
    "they find the critical solution and the critical solution to be universal with respect to families of initial data . turning on quantum effects",
    ", the scaling persists to a point , but the curve of @xmath216 versus @xmath217 then turns smoothly over to a horizontal line .",
    "surprisingly , the value of the mass gap is not universal but depends on the family of initial data .",
    "while this is the most `` satisfactory '' result among those discussed here from the classical point of view , one should keep in mind that all these results are based on mere toy models of quantum gravity .",
    "when one fine - tunes a one - parameter family of initial data to get close enough to the black hole threshold , the details of the initial data are completely forgotten in a spacetime region , and all near - critical time evolutions look the same there .",
    "the only information remembered from the initial data is how close one is to the threshold .",
    "either there is a mass gap ( type i behavior ) , or black hole formation starts at infinitesimal mass ( type ii behavior ) . in type",
    "i , the universal critical solution is time - independent , or periodic in time , and the better the fine - tuning , the longer it persists . in type ii ,",
    "the universal critical solution is scale - invariant or scale - periodic , and the better the fine - tuning , the smaller the black hole mass , according to the famous formula eqn .",
    "( [ power_law ] ) .",
    "both types of behavior arise because there is a solution which sits at the black hole - threshold , and which is an intermediate attractor .",
    "the basin of attraction is ( at least locally ) the black hole threshold itself , pictured as a hypersurface of codimension one that bisects phase space .",
    "only the one perturbation mode pointing out of that surface is unstable .",
    "depending on its sign , the solution tips over towards forming a black hole or towards dispersion . in the words of eardley",
    ", all one - parameter families of data trying to cross the black hole threshold are funneled through a single time evolution .",
    "if the critical solution is time - independent , its linear perturbations grow or decrease exponentially in time .",
    "if it is scale - invariant , they grow or decrease exponentially with the logarithm of scale .",
    "the power - law scaling of the black hole mass follows by a clever application of dimensional analysis .",
    "although the mathematical foundations of this approach remain doubtful at present , it allows precise numerical calculation of the critical solution and the critical exponent , with good agreement with numerical `` experiment '' .",
    "the importance of type ii behavior lies in providing a natural route from large to very small scales , with possible applications to astrophysics and quantum gravity .",
    "natural here means that the phenomena persist for many simple matter models , without counterexample so far , and , apparently , even beyond spherical symmetry .",
    "as far as any generic parameter in the initial data provides some handle on the amplitude of the one unstable mode , fine - tuning any one generic parameter creates the phenomena .",
    "moreover , scaling and echoing are seen already quite far from the threshold in practice .",
    "clearly , more numerical work will be useful to further establish the generality of the mechanism , or to find a counter - example instead .",
    "in particular , future research should include highly non - spherical situations , initial data with angular momentum and electric charge , and matter models with a large number of internal degrees of freedom ( for example , collisionless matter instead of a perfect fluid ) .",
    "going beyond spherical symmetry , or including collisionless matter , will certainly pose formidable numerical challenges .",
    "the fundamental mathematical question in the field is why so many matter models ( in fact , all models investigated to date ) admit a critical solution , that is , an attractor of codimension one at the black hole threshold . if the existence of a critical solution is really a generic feature , then there should be at least an intuitive argument , and perhaps a mathematical proof , for this important fact .",
    "while it is at present unclear if all matter models admit a self - similar solution with exactly one unstable mode(a type ii critical solution ) , no reasonable matter model can admit a self - similar solution with no unstable modes , or naked singularities would be endemic in nature .",
    "again one wonders if there is a general argument or proof for this fact .",
    "progress in understanding general relativity as a dynamical system ( in the presence of the slicing freedom ) may be a crucial step on the way towards these proofs , and might also contribute to the study of singularities in general relativity .    in the future",
    ", we can expect new phenomena based on continuous families of critical solutions . in numerical investigations we may also come across solutions on the black hole threshold with two or more unstable modes , although as a matter of terminology i would not call these `` critical '' solutions , because they would not `` naturally '' arise in collapse simulations .",
    "critical solutions so far were scale - periodic or scale - invariant ( type ii ) , or static or periodic in time ( type i ) .",
    "are solutions conceivable which have neither of these symmetries , but which are still critical solutions in the essential sense of being attractors inside the black hole threshold ?    numerical relativity has opened up a new research field in classical general relativity , critical phenomena in gravitational collapse .",
    "the interplay between numerical and analytic work in this new field is still continuing strongly .",
    "while its surprising features have captured the attention of many researchers in the gr community , it has also thrown some light on the outstanding problem of mathematical relativity , cosmic censorship .",
