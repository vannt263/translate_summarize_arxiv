    "the nature of the current flow at low temperatures through mesoscopic structures has received a lot of attention during the last years .",
    "after initial focus on the conductance , which measures the average number of electrons transmitted in time , there has been an increasing interest in the noise power , a measure for the variance of the transmitted charge . at zero temperature , these current fluctuations are due to the discreteness of the electron charge .",
    "it has been found theoretically , that the zero - frequency shot - noise power @xmath0 can be suppressed below its classical value characteristic for uncorrelated electron transport , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the average current .",
    "this suppression is due to correlated electron transmission imposed by the pauli principle @xcite .",
    "consequently , it has been shown that in a double - barrier junction @xmath0 can be suppressed down to @xmath3 @xcite , depending on the relative height of the barriers . for a metallic ,",
    "diffusive conductor various calculations yield that @xmath4 .",
    "the shot - noise suppression in these two systems has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , levitov and lesovik have gone one step further by studying the full _ distribution function _ of charge transmitted through a mesoscopic conductor @xcite .",
    "this function gives the probability that a certain number of electrons are transmitted during a given time interval .",
    "their quantum mechanical analysis demonstrates , that the attempts to transmit electrons are periodic in time , yielding a binomial distribution of transmitted electrons . on the basis of this result , lee , levitov , and yakovets",
    "have calculated the charge distribution function for transport through a metallic , diffusive conductor @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we derive the complete distribution of transmitted charge through a double - barrier junction , by two different methods : firstly , we follow a semiclassical approach , in which phase is neglected but the pauli principle is accounted for . here , the electron transport is described by classical jump rates . secondly , we take a quantum mechanical approach , where we average the result of ref .   over the distribution of transmission probabilities through the double - barrier system .",
    "for computational convenience , our analysis is carried out for a single - channel conductor in the absence of spin degeneracy .",
    "however , the results can directly be generalized to a multi - channel conductor .",
    "furthermore , we neglect charging effects , we assume small applied voltage as well as zero temperature , and we restrict ourselves to high tunnel barriers .",
    "the linear - response conductance @xmath5 of a double - barrier junction is given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 the transmission probability through barrier @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , the two approaches to derive eq .",
    "( [ eii1 ] ) are of a completely different nature @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical derivation consists essentially in the addition of the resistances of both junctions , whereas the quantum mechanical derivation involves an average over resonant and non - resonant states .",
    "physically , this averaging may correspond either to an applied voltage larger than the width of the resonance or to a summation over the modes in a multi - channel conductor if the distance between the barriers is larger than the fermi wave length .",
    "the role of the presence of phase coherence on the fluctuations in the current is still an intriguing issue @xcite .",
    "for example , the one - third suppression of the shot noise in a metallic , diffusive conductor was originally surmised to be of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "however , later derivations through a semiclassical approach yielded a suppression by one - third as well @xcite . with respect to the shot - noise power in the double - barrier junction , a quantum mechanical theory by chen and ting @xcite and a semiclassical theory by davies _",
    "et al_.  @xcite give identical results , namely @xmath9 an additional aim of the present paper is to check to which extent this insensitivity to the presence of phase coherence applies also for the complete distribution of transmitted charge .",
    "the quantity of interest is @xmath10 , denoting the probability that exactly @xmath11 electrons have been transmitted during a time interval @xmath12 .",
    "an alternative way to describe this distribution is through its characteristic function @xmath13 .",
