    "nearly twenty years ago , mahan and sofo elucidated the properties that an ideal thermoelectric material ",
    "one that can efficiently transform a temperature differential into a voltage  should have  @xcite .",
    "they found that optimal thermoelectric conversion efficiency in the linear response regime , as determined by a large figure of merit , is realized in systems with a transmission function @xmath0 exhibiting a dirac - delta function dependence on energy .",
    "in such a system , the electron contribution @xmath1 to the thermal conductance at zero charge current vanishes and the figure of merit zt = is only limited by the smallness of @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the electrical conductance , @xmath4 is the seebeck coefficient ( thermopower ) , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electrical and phonon contributions to the thermal conductance .",
    "although realistic systems do not exhibit such transmission , considerable experimental and theoretical work has concentrated on exploring thermoelectric properties of nearly single - level `` impurity '' systems such as quantum dots  @xcite or molecular junctions  @xcite .",
    "such systems can in principle exhibit a transmission that is strongly peaked about this level and hence , promise large figures of merit . at the same time , these are _ small _ systems and their coupling to the leads has a significant effect on the transmission function @xmath5 , yielding an extrinsic broadening @xmath6 .",
    "nonetheless , the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance is expected to be small in these systems as compared to that in bulk ones , and there is still great interest in exploring their thermoelectric properties .",
    "( recent studies have stressed the importance of the phonon contribution @xmath2 in molecules , however  @xcite . )    beyond numerical studies of the thermoelectric performance of impurity models based on numerical renormalization group  @xcite and the nonequilibrium green s function approach  @xcite , simple analytic results for thermoelectric coefficients have been found in the `` atomic limit '' , in which the broadening @xmath7 is taken to be zero , using e.g. , the sequential - tunnelling approximation for transport  @xcite . in this limit , taking the coulomb repulsion @xmath8 to be zero , one recovers the idealized , un - broadened single - level limit of mahan and sofo , and correspondingly , an infinite electronic contribution to the figure of merit ( i.e. , after setting @xmath9 ) . turning on interactions , a second satellite level arises due to the interaction energy shift @xmath8 when two electrons are present in the impurity . in the atomic limit @xmath7 with strong interactions",
    ", @xmath10 , murphy , mukerjee , and moore  @xcite showed that the second level becomes unoccupied and hence , irrelevant for transport , meaning that the system again effectively reduces to a single - level one with a diverging electronic figure of merit . for intermediate coupling strength , @xmath11 , both levels are active in transport and the figure of merit is not large in general .",
    "analogous studies of thermoelectricity in the atomic limit of bulk systems have been undertaken in a pair of well - known papers by beni  @xcite and chaikin and beni  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) . as emphasized by beni  @xcite , however , it is nontrivial to perturb away from the atomic limit of transport since transport formally vanishes when @xmath12 ( for them , the limit where the hopping matrix element between lattice sites vanishes ) . for a single - level spin - full impurity",
    ", the available hilbert space for transport formally evolves from having three elements , corresponding to the three possible occupancies , to an infinite number , a large fraction of which must be used in order to have a conserving theory of transport  @xcite . even when interactions are modest , it is challenging to develop a reliable perturbation expansion of transport quantities in powers of the coupling matrix elements between the impurity and leads ( effectively , @xmath6 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use sum rules for the impurity electron spectral function to derive expressions for the thermoelectric coefficients that are asymptotically exact in two regimes for which the broadening is small , but nonzero : first , at high temperatures , greater than @xmath13 and the bandwidth @xmath14 that characterizes the leads .",
    "second , in the very strongly - correlated , `` narrow - level '' limit where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . our results in this latter regime reproduce the divergent figure of merit in the atomic limit when @xmath17  @xcite . at the same time , this limit is highly singular and we find _ 0 zt(ut ) ~,[ztdiv]where @xmath18 is the difference between the impurity energy and fermi levels .",
    "this result emphasizes the difficulty of studying transport in this limit and also the crucial role played by the broadening in the thermoelectric performance of impurity models with strong interactions .",

    "( as we explain below , this situation can also be dealt with using the methods developed in this paper , although the resulting calculations would be more complicated . )",
    "the above expressions will form the basis of our analysis in the remainder of this paper .    before closing this section , we briefly comment on the major result of mahan and sofo who , as noted earlier , showed that the electronic contribution to the figure of merit would diverge in a system described by a single , un - broadened energy level . in the language of this section , this corresponds to having a dirac - delta function spectral function a(e)(e-_0).[msa]using this in the above , the thermopower is ( restoring @xmath41 ) @xmath45 .",
    "crucially , using ( [ msa ] ) in ( [ m ] ) , one finds m_2 = , [ divergingkappacond]and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance vanishes identically at _ all temperatures _ , with the result that the figure of merit is divergent at all temperatures .    moving away from the limit ( [ msa ] ) of having a single un - broadened energy level ,",

    "it is thus clear why a system with a single un - broadened energy level would be optimal , having zero variance in its energy levels ; see also eq .  ( 18 ) in mahan and sofo  @xcite .",
    "this result also presages our main conclusion : even though an extremely large @xmath8 can eliminate the energy - level variance due to interactions , unless the broadening @xmath6 due to coupling with the leads can be made smaller than the temperature ( not currently the situation in experiments  @xcite ) , the energy variance will be greater that @xmath49 , and one should only expect modest thermoelectric performance .",

    "in fact , apart from the renormalization factor @xmath189 accounting for the absence of doubly - occupied states , this is precisely the single - particle energy of a noninteracting electron in an impurity coupled to leads by ( [ v ] ) .",
    "consistent with the findings of ref .",
    ", by eliminating the possibility of having a doubly occupied impurity , extremely strong correlations have effectively reduced the transport problem to that of a single - level . as a result ,",
    "transport is effectively that of noninteracting electrons , albeit with a reduced hilbert space ( @xmath190 )    as with noninteracting electrons , thermoelectric performance in this regime is limited by the broadening due to the coupling between the impurity and the lead . specifically , when the lead - impurity coupling is larger than the detuning from the fermi level , @xmath191 , the figure of merit ( [ ztc ] ) is generically of order unity .",

    "[ hffig ] closely resembles the @xmath202 fig .  1 in ref .",
    "much of the interest in studying the thermoelectric performance of quantum dots and molecules originates in the likely small phonon contribution to the thermal conductance in these systems and also the fact that they can be well - approximated as single - level systems . for a single - level noninteracting impurity system ,",
    "the figure of merit diverges in the limit that the extrinsic broadening arising from the coupling to the leads is much smaller than the temperature .",
    "turning on a coulomb repulsion , the appearance of a satellite hubbard peak leads to an increase in the variance of the single - particle energy level and hence , a diminished figure of merit .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , when the coulomb repulsion is _ very _ strong , however , the new satellite hubbard level becomes unimportant , as it is too high an energy scale to be relevant for transport .",
    "we have used asymptotically exact sum rule expressions in this limit to show that the thermoelectric transport coefficients assume essentially the same form as for a noninteracting system , slightly renormalized to account for the absence of doubly occupied states . the thermopower ( [ sc ] ) in particular assumes the well - known mott  heikes form , but with an effective noninteracting chemical potential . as with a noninteracting system , the transport properties in this strong interaction regime are limited only by the broadening due to the coupling between the leads and the impurity .",
    "this bodes well for using small impurity - type systems such as quantum dots and molecules to achieve substantial thermoelectric efficiencies .",
    "even though the bare ( un - screened ) coulomb energy scale is very large ( @xmath10 ) in these systems , it is precisely its large size that means it does not lead to a diminishment of transport , as would happen if it was of moderate strength , say @xmath11 . at the same time , the highly singular dependence of the figure of merit on the broadening and also the lead bandwidth [ c.f .",
