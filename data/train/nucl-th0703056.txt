    "collisions between two nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies produce charged particles - either in the hadronic or in the partonic state , depending on the collision energy .",
    "interaction of these charged particles produce real and virtual photons .",
    "because of their nature of interaction , the mean free path of photons is very large compared to the size of the system formed after the collision .",
    "therefore , photons can be used as an efficient tools to understand the initial conditions of the state where it is created  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to analyze this experimental data obtained by phenix collaboration  @xcite for @xmath2 collisions at @xmath1 gev and infer the initial temperature ( @xmath3 ) of the system formed after the collisions .",
    "the hard collisions of initial state partons in the colliding nuclei produce photons with high transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this contributions can be estimated by pqcd .",
    "we use the next to leading order ( nlo ) predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath5 collisions and scale it up by the number of binary collisions for @xmath6 interactions to obtain the pqcd contributions to the direct photons .",
    "we assume here that quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed initially which then expands , cools , and reverts back to hadronic matter and finally freezes out at a temperature ( @xmath7 )",
    ". therefore , evaluation of photon spectra both from qgp and hadronic matter is required .",
    "the photon emission rate from qgp due to compton ( @xmath8 ) and annihilation ( @xmath9 ) processes is evaluated in  @xcite by using hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation .",
    "later it was shown  @xcite that photon production from the reactions , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 contribute in the same order as annihilation and compton processes .",
    "the complete calculation of photon emission rate from qgp to order @xmath14 is completed by resuming ladder diagrams in the effective theory  @xcite .",
    "this result has been used in the present work .      for the photon production from hadronic matter all the possible reactions and",
    "decays involving @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been considered ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "photons from the decays of @xmath20 , @xmath18 etc are subtracted from the data and hence is not discussed here .",
    "various experimental  @xcite and theoretical results  @xcite suggest that the spectral functions of hadrons are modified in a hot and dense nuclear environment .",
    "there is no consensus on the nature of the vector meson modification in matter - pole shift or broadening - both experimentally and theoretically . in the present work we use brown - rho ( br ) scaling scenario  @xcite for in - medium modifications of hadronic masses to indicate how far the value of initial temperature is affected when the reduction of the hadronic mass is incorporated in evaluating the photon spectra .",
    "transverse momentum distribution of photons produced from the fragmentation of fast quarks propagating through qgp remains almost unaffected due its energy loss  @xcite .",
    "photons produced due to interactions between thermal and non - thermal partons  @xcite have been neglected in the current analysis .",
    "( 2 + 1 ) dimensional  @xcite ( ideal ) relativistic hydrodynamics with longitudinal boost invariance  @xcite and cylindrical symmetry has been used for the space time evolution .",
    "we take initial thermalization time @xmath21 fm / c , @xmath22 mev and the number of flavours , @xmath23 .",
    "these values reproduce the measured total multiplicity , @xmath24 .",
    "the initial energy density and radial velocity profiles are taken as : @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26\\right]$].here @xmath27 is the surface thickness and @xmath28 is the radius of the colliding nuclei .",
    "two types of equation of state ( eos ) are used to study the photon spectra : ( i ) bag model eos has been used for qgp . for the hadronic matter all the resonances with mass @xmath29 2.5 gev @xmath30 has been considered .",
    "( ii ) results from lattice qcd  @xcite has also been used to show the sensitivity of the results on the eos .",
    "photon spectra is evaluated with the initial conditions mentioned above .",
    "the value of the freeze - out temperature @xmath31 mev  @xcite has been fixed from the @xmath4 spectra of pions and kaons  @xcite .",
    "the value of the transition temperature , @xmath32 mev  @xcite is taken here .",
    "the resulting photon spectra is contrasted with the recent phenix measurements of direct photons in fig .",
    "the data is reproduced with @xmath22 mev and @xmath21 fm / c .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is smaller compared to the value obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because the reduction of hadronic masses in a thermal bath increases their abundances and hence the rate of photon emission gets enhanced .",
    "therefore , to pinpoint the actual initial temperature through photon spectra it is imperative to understand the properties of hadrons in hot and dense environment .",
    "this may be compared with the value of @xmath33 mev obtained from the analysis  @xcite of wa98 data  @xcite at sps energy .",
    "the photon spectra is also evaluated using eos from lattice qcd .",
    "it is seen ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that the data can be reproduced with lower @xmath34 mev ( and hence larger @xmath35 fm / c ) .",
    "this is so because for type ii eos the space time evolution of the hadronic phase is slower than type ( i ) .",
    "it may be mentioned at this point that the photon emission rates obtained in  @xcite are valid in the weak coupling limit .",
    "however , the qgp formed after @xmath0 collisions at rhic energy could be strongly coupled and the photon production from strongly coupled qgp is not available from thermal qcd .",
    "therefore , result from @xmath36 supersymmetric yang mills ( sym ) theory  @xcite has been used to estimate the photon production from qgp phase in the strong coupling limit . the rate obtained in this case",
    "could be treated as a upper limit of photon production from qgp .",
    "the results obtained in this case are compared with that from thermal qcd in right panel of fig .",
    "photons from sym is enhanced by about @xmath37 as compared to thermal qcd in the @xmath4 region @xmath38 gev .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the direct photon data measured by phenix collaboration for @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the data can be reproduced by assuming a deconfined state of quarks and gluons with @xmath39 mev . however , for eos from lattice qcd the data can be explained for lower value of @xmath34 mev .",
    "photon productions from thermal qcd and @xmath36 sym have been used for the analysis of data . in both the cases similar values of the initial temperatures",
    "are obtained .",
