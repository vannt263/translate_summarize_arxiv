    "<S> tangles were introduced by j. conway . in 1970 , he proved that every rational 2-tangle defines a rational number and two rational 2-tangles are isotopic if and only if they have the same rational number . </S>",
    "<S> so , from conway s result we have a perfect classification for rational @xmath0-tangles . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no similar theorem to classify rational @xmath1-tangles .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce an invariant of rational @xmath2-tangles which is obtained from the kauffman bracket . </S>",
    "<S> it forms a vector with laurent polynomial entries . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that the invariant classifies the rational @xmath0-tangles and the reduced alternating rational @xmath1-tangles . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that it classifies the rational @xmath1-tangles as well . </S>"
