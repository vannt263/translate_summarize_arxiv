    "the analysis of financial data by methods developed for physical systems has a long tradition @xcite , and has attracted the interest of physicists .",
    "one of the most motivated reasons is that it is a great scientific challenge to understand the dynamics of a strongly fluctuating complex system with a large number of interacting elements .",
    "in addition , it may be possible that the experience gained in the process of studying complex physical systems might yield new results in economics .",
    "there are many observables generated from financial markets , and one central issue of the research on the dynamics of financial markets is the statistics of price changes which determine losses and gains .",
    "the price changes of a time series of quotations @xmath4 are commonly measured by returns : @xmath5 , log - returns , or increments : @xmath6 at a time scale @xmath7 . in 1900 , bachelier proposed the first model for the stochastic process of returns  an uncorrelated random walk with independent identically distributed gaussian random variables @xcite .",
    "however , prices do not follow a signal random walk process @xcite . for example",
    ", the daily correlation has been known as the daily log - returns correlated with themselves in such a way that positive returns are followed by positive returns as well @xcite .",
    "many considerations have been aroused by this effect recently and meanwhile the related research has been reported , not only for daily data @xcite but also for high frequency data @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation ( le ) which distinguishes the development of sample path into the deterministic and random terms , has been used to deal with the brownian motion problem .",
    "recently , the langevin approach was used to analyze the financial time series on scale @xcite .",
    "@xcite have investigated how price changes @xmath8 on different time scales @xmath7 are correlated motivated by hierarchical structure of financial time series , which is similar to the energy cascade in hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "they derived a multiplicative langevin equation from a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) in the variable scale @xmath7 and performed the statistical way to distinguish and quantify the deterministic and the random influence on the hierarchical structure of the financial time series in terms of the drift and diffusion parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively @xcite .",
    "different from the former study in which the le is used to analyze the scales evolutions of finance , yet , in this paper , with the langevin description , a new insight on the dynamics of the process will be obtained by investigating the time - dependence of log - returns .",
    "the time - dependent properties of prices evolution are derived in the way of estimating drift parameter @xmath11 of sampled local periods in the sliding window .",
    "then , the relation between @xmath11 and autocorrelation @xmath12 , average return @xmath13 , from which the practical significance of @xmath11 can be recognized , are resulted both from the statistical time - dependence of @xmath11 and some theoretical analyses .",
    "besides , our langevin description contains , as a particular case with flat-@xmath11 , the effect of daily correlation in log - returns . on the other hand , the form of diffusion parameter @xmath14 got in this paper , to some extent , explains the heavy tailed probability densities of price changes .",
    "the research are mainly carried out from the samples of the daily log - returns @xmath15 of s@xmath0p @xmath1 index from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , containing @xmath16 days , thus covering a wide time range with many different economic and political situations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , taking the daily log - returns as an example , we generally discuss the application of langevin approach to log - returns series . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results and discussions . finally , the summary and the outlook of this paper are given in sec .",
    "for a time series of prices or market index values @xmath4 , the log - return @xmath17 over a time scale @xmath7 is defined as the forward change in the logarithm of @xmath4 , @xmath18 the behavior of daily log - return @xmath19 as a stochastic variable is described by the following le : @xmath20 where the drift parameter @xmath11 and diffusion parameter @xmath14 respectively describe the deterministic and the random influences on the time process of log - returns , and @xmath21 denotes the increment of a standard wiener process .",
    "it is assumed that , within each sampling window the parameters may depend on the log - returns , but not explicitly on time ( stationary ) .",
    "thus , the drift and diffusion parameters of the sampled period can be extracted from the sampled data by simply using the definition @xcite , @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the averaging operator and @xmath24 is a realization of the le ( [ eq01 ] ) . from eq.([eq02 ] ) , it is obvious that the drift parameter @xmath11 is the average increment of unit time under the condition @xmath25 , which represents the deterministic influences .",
    "@xmath14 is the deviation of @xmath11 which pictures the random influences .",
    "it has been known that the autocorrelation of the log - returns decays very fast which is usually characterized by a correlation time much shorter than a trading day @xcite .",
    "when the time increment @xmath26 is larger than @xmath27 day , the daily log - returns can be considered as the result of many uncorrelated ` shocks ' .",
    "thus , in this paper , @xmath26 is mainly set as @xmath27 day .",
    "compared to the length of time window @xmath28 , @xmath29 approximately accords with the limit in eq.([eq02 ] ) and eq.([eq03 ] ) .",
    "based on the samplings all over the long series , the statistical results of @xmath11 and @xmath30 which are respectively estimated by eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq03 ] ) have their simple and general forms .",
    "the results of @xmath11 are close to a linear form , and that of @xmath30 are close to a parabolic form , @xmath31 fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] presents the statistical results of @xmath11 and @xmath30 ( circles ) which are estimated from the daily log - returns time series of s@xmath0p @xmath1 index from @xmath32 may .",
    "@xmath33 to @xmath34 jun .",
    "@xmath35 ( window length @xmath36 ) .",
    "the statistical results for large @xmath37 are more noisy and uncertain than the points near the origin , because these border points are visited rarely by the trajectory . on the contrary , as viewed from statistics , the more one given @xmath38 is visited , the more times the averaging operator @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) works , which would produce more accurate and reasonable @xmath40 .",
    "thus , while approximating @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) with linear form and @xmath42 ( @xmath41 ) with parabolic form by least - squares fit , the effect of the visited probability for each @xmath38 should be considered , with each @xmath38 corresponding to its own weight .",
    "it is natural for a physical scientist to define the weighted factor of @xmath38 as its probability , @xmath43 where the @xmath44 is the frequency of @xmath38 within the time window of length @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the approximations of the statistical results of @xmath11 and @xmath30 with equal - weight ( dashed lines ) and weighted factor @xmath45 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the values of the fitting error @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( the mean standard deviations from approximations of @xmath11 and @xmath30 ) with weighted factor @xmath45 are visibly lower than those with equal - weight .",
    "therefore , while approximating the statistical results , the point at @xmath38 is endued the weight @xmath45 which is correlated to the frequency of @xmath38 within the window .    for the given return value @xmath38",
    ", the frequency @xmath44 also depends on the length of time windows .",
    "thus , it is worth mentioning the influences from the length @xmath28 on the approximations .",
    "the relations between @xmath28 and the fitting errors of @xmath11 and @xmath30 are investigated . to estimate the error purely made by window length @xmath28 , not by information the time series embodied ,",
    "the daily log - returns series is randomly rearranged and the fitting errors @xmath46 and @xmath47 vs. @xmath48 are calculated ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it was found that the weighted fitting errors @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the approximations with weighted factor @xmath45 decline quickly with a perfect power - law behavior , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this behavior suggests that the statistical results of @xmath11 ( or @xmath30 ) with larger @xmath28 is more feasible to be approximated with linear ( or parabolic ) form .",
    "note incidentally that , only the results with the same window length @xmath28 could be compared since different @xmath28 corresponds to different fitting errors .",
    "the algorithm for the detection of the time - dependence of drift term @xmath11 in this paper can be described as follows : sample the long log - returns series with a sliding window of short length t , and compute @xmath11 for each location .",
    "the results estimated from the time window which samples a given local period , present the corresponding local characters of financial markets .",
    "the algorithm is more sensitive than merely studying transient behavior .",
    "the comment for the selection of window length @xmath28 is to choose @xmath28 long enough so that the averages in eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq03 ] ) are statistically meaningful but not so long as to lose the temporal resolution . in the results presented below , @xmath51 and @xmath52 window lengths and @xmath53 overlapping ( window shift by @xmath54 days per time )",
    "the corresponding fitting errors are , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "it is expected that the variation of @xmath11 as a function of time can accurately indicate interesting dynamical changes in financial process .",
    "in the le ( [ eq01 ] ) , the drift parameter @xmath11 could be seen as an action of potential , with @xmath59 . noted that @xmath11 has a linear form with negative slope , it could be interpreted as the effect of linear state - dependent restoring force with symmetrical potential well , @xmath60 where @xmath37 presents the position of one given particle enslaved to it .",
    "the sketch maps of @xmath11 and @xmath61 are showed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] in which the equilibrium position ( @xmath62 ) is @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the time series of log - returns @xmath64 , restoring force @xmath11 and potential @xmath61 from @xmath65 may .",
    "@xmath66 to @xmath27 jan .",
    "it is easy to find that the vibrancy of log - returns @xmath37 presented seems to be similar to force @xmath11 and potential @xmath61 , which can be clearly seen from several large events marked in this figure , and the restoring force @xmath11 always presents converse effect to log - returns @xmath37 . in some large events ,",
    "the potential @xmath61 is exceedingly large .    in the following",
    ", the time dependence of restoring force @xmath11 will be discussed including the equilibrium position @xmath68 and the slope coefficient @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , discussions of the diffusion parameter @xmath14 and the error analysis will be given .      from langevin equation @xcite , the so called equilibrium position @xmath68 , which is the zero value of negative - sloped linear drift term , corresponds to the minimum of the potential well . from a physical point of view , the average displacement @xmath13 of an oscillating particle in the potential well defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq09 ] ) should also be the minimum of the potential well , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we get , @xmath71 the average displacement @xmath13 was directly obtained from the log - returns series , and the equilibrium position @xmath68 was calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq04 ] ) .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath68 and @xmath13 coincide with each other very well all over the ranges [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) ] , and the plots of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) was excellent agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) .    in language of finance , the average log - return @xmath13 describes the macroscopical trend of the price movement : @xmath72 indicates going up , and @xmath73 indicates going down .",
    "therefore , based on eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) , the rising trend of prices could be estimated if the statistical result @xmath74 ; otherwise , the falling trend could be estimated if @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the equilibrium position @xmath76 of restoring force @xmath11 is comprehended as the ` trend index ' of stock prices .",
    "furthermore , the stock prices and their log - returns are macroeconomic indicators which are widely used because of the strong correlation between financial markets and economic development . in this case , the equilibrium position @xmath68 , which is derived from the les description of financial time series , would be another important indicator of macroeconomics .      in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) , the time dependence of the slope coefficient @xmath69 calculated from the daily log - returns of s@xmath0p @xmath1 with @xmath77 and @xmath52 are plotted .",
    "the ranges of the slope coefficient @xmath69 with @xmath77 and @xmath52 are @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 $ ] respectively , both of which are close to the value @xmath80 . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) we know that in a certain given position @xmath38 , steeper ( flatter ) slope of @xmath11 corresponds to larger ( smaller ) restoring force @xmath40 .",
    "thus , one can imagine the mechanism of our model : it would take few times for larger forces ( slope : @xmath81 ) to draw particles from one side of the equilibrium position @xmath76 to another side , which we called ` @xmath76-crossing ' action for the moment , and more times for smaller forces ( slope : @xmath82 ) . to discuss the aforementioned mechanism more accurately ,",
    "normalized daily log - returns are used , @xmath83 which has zero mean value , @xmath84 . here the standard deviation @xmath85 of log - returns is defined as the time averaged volatility @xcite and the @xmath86 denotes an average over the entire length of the series within time window @xmath28 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) , @xmath87 has the equilibrium position @xmath76 equaling zero , so that the @xmath76-crossing action could be reduced to the sign convert of @xmath87 . thus the mechanism can be described as follows : the sign of @xmath87 changes frequently while the slope is quite steep ; on the contrary , same signs congregate together and sequences of consecutive ` @xmath88 ' or ` @xmath89 ' appear when the slope is flat .    the sign series of daily log - returns has been considered to study the daily correlation in log - returns @xcite .",
    "those researchers got the conditional dynamics from the sequence of consecutive ` @xmath88 ' and ` @xmath89 ' . in this paper , however , we will compare the sequence of the same sign with the converting sign of two neighboring days to check the relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath76-crossing .",
    "the sign - cases of a given day and its previous day are : ` @xmath90 ' , ` @xmath91 ' , ` @xmath92 ' and ` @xmath93 ' .",
    "one can define ` @xmath90 ' and ` @xmath93 ' as the sign - sustained cases , and ` @xmath91 ' and ` @xmath92 ' as the sign - convert cases .",
    "incidentally , the contribution of ` @xmath90 ' to the sign - sustained cases was shown to be a little more than ` @xmath93 ' on average over the whole series . then , the time series of signs of @xmath87 is investigated by counting the frequencies of sign - sustained cases , @xmath94 , and sign - convert cases , @xmath95 .",
    "the time dependence of the proportion @xmath96 and the slope coefficient @xmath69 calculated from the daily log - returns of s@xmath0p @xmath1 with @xmath77 and @xmath52 are plotted in figs . [",
    "fig6](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the good similarity of @xmath97 and @xmath69 proves that the slope coefficient is related to the @xmath76-crossing action and reflects the correlation of neighboring daily log - returns . in detail , in one sampled period , while the slope of the restoring force is flat , the given day s sign of log - return is more likely to be the same as its previous day ; on the country , while the slope is steep , the given day s sign is more likely to be different from its previous day .",
    "thus , the mechanism of the daily correlation in log - returns is qualitatively explained by the restoring force .",
    "it s easy to notice from the time dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath97 [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](a)(c ) ] over the whole series , most of the periods have their slope @xmath69 larger than @xmath80 , and @xmath97 larger than @xmath27 , with mean values @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , @xmath101 . these imply that , in practice , the flat - slope restoring force is more prevalent than the steep - slope one , and the case of sign - sustained is more than that of the sign - convert .",
    "consequently , from the general appearance of sign - sustained cases , the same conclusion was reached as that of @xcite : the return of the price during a given day can be correlated with the previous day , in particular with the sign of the previous day .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that , the analysis with langevin approach is more general because it contains the positive daily correlation as the particular case with flat - slope restoring force , and non - correlation with steep - slope restoring force .    on the other hand , the autocorrelation function @xmath102 , a typically important statistics of stochastic processes , is always used to investigate pairwise correlation of the log - returns of a financial asset . in the following ,",
    "we compared it with the slope coefficient @xmath69 from mathematical relations and statistical results .",
    "it is known that , @xmath103 where @xmath86 denotes time averaging over all the trading days within the sampled local period with length @xmath28 , @xmath104 is time increment .    for the weighted linear least - squares fit , which has been used to approximate the statistical results of @xmath11 , the weighted objective function @xcite can be written as , @xmath105^{2}}. \\label{eq14}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 presents the weight of the point @xmath107 .",
    "the values of @xmath69 and @xmath108 corresponding to the minimal values of function @xmath109 are something to be sought for .",
    "thus from eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , the solution of slope coefficient @xmath69 in @xmath110 is achieved , @xmath111 in the previous discussion , the weight of @xmath38 was defined as its probability @xmath45 ( eq .",

    "however , since the lack of correlation for @xmath116 , only the case with @xmath29 is analyzed .",

    "( [ eq04 ] ) , @xmath122 this new form as a function of the traditional qualities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , is a more direct way to understand the dynamical behavior of time series . to the financial data ,",
    "the information given by @xmath11 mixes features of the macroscopical properties together with the detail of the prices evolution : the macroscopical trend of prices is presented by the equilibrium position @xmath68 , and the detail correlation between two neighboring days is exhibited by the slope coefficient @xmath69 .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) can be informatively rewritten as @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath124 is the characteristic relaxation time , @xmath125 , and reflects the same properties of the log - returns as the slope coefficient @xmath69 does , but @xmath124 is more visualized .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath124 , which were calculated from the sliding windows of various length , are all less than @xmath126 days , and the average values of @xmath124 with @xmath77 and @xmath36 are @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the effect of the restoring force @xmath11 of one given day decays with the characteristic relaxation time less than @xmath126 days .",
    "the diffusion parameter @xmath14 , which usually has the form shown in eq .",
