    "up to now the quark - level substructure of scalar mesons is still not well understood . especially , the slight scalars mesons , including @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which form an su(3 ) flavor nonet and are considered as either two quark states or tetraquak states ( di - quark and anti - diquark structure ) as originally advocated by jaffe @xcite .",

    "a mixing angle @xmath22 was determined from the decays @xmath23 , and @xmath24 or @xmath25 from the decays @xmath26 , while a range @xmath27 was given from the analysis of three body decay @xmath28 .",

    "but if the theoretical uncertainties are included , the range will become wider .",
    "although the branching ratio @xmath133 with large uncertainty can not give stringent constrain on the value of the mixing angle , we can get some hints from the data : if we take the mixing angle @xmath134 , that is , we consider that the scalar meson @xmath13 is composed entirely of two quark component @xmath14 , the corresponding branching ratio is about @xmath135 , which is a little lower than the experimental value .",
    "if we consider the small mixing with @xmath136 , the branching ratio will get an enhancement for the interference between the two different kinds amplitudes from the different quark components , the maximal value for the branching ratio can be obtained at the mixing angle @xmath137 , and arrives at @xmath138 ( shown in the right panel of fig.2 ) .",
    "but if we take such small mixing angle , say about @xmath139 , it will make the branching ratio of the decay @xmath129 undershoot the shaded band in the left panel of fig.2 , which represents the experimental allowed region .",

    "if so , the predicted branching ratios of both the decays @xmath141 and @xmath129 will deviate from the data even with the large errors taken into account .",

    "but it is not in conflict with the dominant four - quark structure in explaining the mass degeneracy of @xmath13 and @xmath18 , and the narrower decay width of @xmath13 than that of @xmath20 . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the mixing angle by considering the ratio of branching fractions .",
    "there are some advantages in considering the ratio , because one can eliminate the systematic errors on the experimental side , and avoid the hadronic uncertainties , such as the decay constants and the gegenbauer moments of the final states on the theoretical side . from the data",
    ", one can find that the ratio of these two branching fractions @xmath143 .",
    "unfortunately , here the uncertainty is mainly from the statistical error in the decay @xmath144 , so the errors of the ratio are not much improved compared to those of the branching ratio of each decay mode . certainly , here we consider a simple method , maybe there is a much better approach for the experimentalists to greatly reduce the errors from this ratio .",
    "so we advice to accurately measure this ratio in experiment , because it is important to further restrict the mixing angle @xmath4 between @xmath13 and @xmath145 .",
    "the ratio can change in a very large range with the mixing angle taking different values , especially for @xmath146 , the branching ratio of @xmath144 is very small and will be exactly equal to zero if the contribution from @xmath147 is turned off , while @xmath148 arrives its maximal value",
    ". then it will be meaningless for the ratio , not mentioning the errors .",

    "if combining these four panels in fig.2 and fig.3 together , one will get two further shrunken mixing angle ranges @xmath149 and @xmath150 . in view of present large uncertainties from data and theory , it will be difficult to get an unitary value for the mixing angle .",
    "but even if more precise data are available , we still can not get the unitary value .",
    "this argument might be reasonable that there must be some influence from other components in @xmath13 , such as gluon , four quark component , and @xmath151 threshold effect , which we can not handle at present .",

    "<S> through analyzing the @xmath0 charmed decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 within the framework of the pqcd factorization approach and comparing with the current data , we find that there are two possible regions for the @xmath3 mixing angle @xmath4 : one is centered at @xmath5 and the other is falls into @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the former can overlap mostly with one of allowed angle regions extracted from the decay @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> especially , for the decay @xmath9 , its branching fraction changes only slightly between @xmath10 when the mixing angle @xmath4 runs from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> all of our results support the picture that the @xmath13 is dominated by two quark component in the b decay dynamic mechanism . </S>",
