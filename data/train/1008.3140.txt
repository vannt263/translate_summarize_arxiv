    "different explosion models predict different element abundance distributions and nucleosynthesis yields .",

    ". since the products of the he flashes are not always c and o but could also be heavier elements ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the outermost layers of the wd do not necessarily consist only of nearly equal mass fractions of c and o. the heavier elements synthesized in the pre - sn stage can also be responsible for the high velocity features of the si and ca lines present in the earliest spectra @xcite .",
    "the overall abundance distribution is not consistent with the almost fully mixed distribution seen in three - dimensional deflagration models @xcite .",
    "but the boundaries between stable fe/@xmath2ni , @xmath2ni / ime , ime / o - rich layers are less clear than in the one - dimensional models .",

    ", we derive an ejecta kinetic energy of @xmath133 erg , which is in a good agreement with the kinetic energy of the w7 model ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "thus , the element masses derived from the modelling under the assumption of the w7 density structure are self - consistent .",
    "we first compare the integrated yields with those of one - dimensional models ( table [ tab : mass ] ) .",
    "the total mass of stable fe - group elements estimated for sn 2003du is reasonably consistent with that of the one - dimensional explosion models .",
    "the amount of neutron - rich stable elements in the central region is sensitive to the deflagration speed , which affects the efficiency of the electron captures .",
    "thus , the good agreement implies that the deflagration speed in the explosion models is reasonable .",
    "the mass of @xmath2ni  in sn 2003du is also consistent with that of the one - dimensional deflagration and delayed detonation models . in the delayed detonation models ,",
    "a larger amount of @xmath2ni  suggests an earlier transition to a detonation .",
    "thus , if the delayed detonation model is the correct scenario , a transition density close to that of the models wdd1 and wdd2 is reasonable for sn 2003du .    the total mass of imes estimated for sn 2003du is smaller than in the delayed detonation models , while the mass of o in sn 2003du is larger .",
    "this suggests that o burning in sn 2003du was not as strong as in the delayed detonation models .",
    "however , the unburned c mass in the outermost layers in sn 2003du is smaller than in the deflagration models .",
    "thus , the outermost part of the c+o wd is burned more intensely than in the deflagration model ( see also section [ sec : distribution ] ) .",
    "next , we compare the results with multi - dimensional models .",
    "the mass of @xmath2ni  in sn 2003du is clearly larger than in the three - dimensional deflagration model @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional deflagration model also predicts more unburned c , which is not consistent with the small c mass derived for sn 2003du .",
    "thus , also from the nucleosynthetic point of view , the three - dimensional deflagration model is unlikely to be a reasonable model for a normal sne ia such as sn 2003du .",
    "it is interesting to compare the yields with the detonating failed deflagration model @xcite and the off - center delayed detonation model @xcite , because these models may explain the kinematic offset in the central region suggested by the nir spectra at late phases @xcite .",
    "the detonating failed deflagration model @xcite predicts too much @xmath2ni  compared with sn 2003du .",
    "thus , this model does not seem a likely model for normal sne ia , as already cautioned by @xcite .",
    "the yields of the two - dimensional off - center delayed detonation model @xcite are in good agreement with those derived for sn 2003du .",
    "it is , however , noted that the model predicts @xmath2ni  synthesized near the center , while the existence of a region free of @xmath2ni  is suggested from our one - dimensional analysis of the nebular phase spectrum ( section [ sec : late ] ) .      in this section , we compare the abundance distributions and integrated yields derived for sn 2003du with those derived for sne 2002bo ( paper i ) and 2004eo ( paper ii ) .",

    "the mass of this region @xmath135 is similar in the three sne studied thus far ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the most significant difference between sne 2003du and 2002bo is in the outermost layers . in sn 2002bo si",

    "the abundance of si in the outer layers of sn 2002bo is larger than in sn 2003du .",
    "this is the primary reason why si line velocities in sn 2002bo are higher than in sn 2003du , as demonstrated in appendix [ app : si ] .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the difference between high - velocity and low - velocity sne ia is caused by the difference in the si abundance .",
    "alternatively , the difference can also be caused by the difference in the density structure in the outer layers .",
    "@xcite pointed that the difference in the velocity ( and/or velocity gradient ) is caused by viewing - angle effects in an aspherical explosion that has different density structures depending on the viewing angle .",
    "sn 2002bo also has a more extended @xmath2ni  distribution than in sn 2003du .",
    "this explains the rapid rise of the lc of sn 2002bo ( paper i ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the rising time of the lc of sne with a high velocity gradient is generally shorter than that of sne with a low velocity gradient .",
    "thus , the extended @xmath2ni  distribution may be a common property of high - velocity sne .",
    "interestingly , sne 2003du and 2004eo have a similar distribution of si , o , and c above @xmath136  ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this indicates that the different shapes of the lcs of these two sne result from the difference in the inner layers .",
    "in fact , a difference between these sne is seen in the mass and mass fraction of @xmath2ni .",
    "a smaller amount of @xmath2ni  is responsible for the fainter luminosity and more rapid decline of sn 2004eo ( see also paper ii ) .",
    "we have studied the element abundance distribution in sn 2003du by modelling the optical spectra at the photospheric and nebular phases . these are used to place constraints on the abundances at the outer and inner layers , respectively . since sn 2003du is a normal type ia sn , both photometrically and spectroscopically ,",
    "the abundance distribution derived for sn 2003du can be considered as representative of normal type ia sne .",
    "the abundance distribution and the integrated yields in sn 2003du can be summarized as follows .",
    "the innermost layers are dominated by stable , neutron - rich elements , with a total mass of @xmath1 .",
    "the yield is roughly consistent with the results of one - dimensional models .",
    "this may imply that the deflagration speed assumed in the models is reasonable .    above the stable elements ,",
    "there is a thick @xmath2ni - rich layer .",
    "the total mass of @xmath2ni  is @xmath3 , which is consistent with the one - dimensional deflagration model and the one - dimensional delayed detonation models with transition density @xmath138 .",
    "the @xmath2ni  mass is larger than in the three - dimensional deflagration model and smaller than in the detonating failed deflagration model .",
    "the layers dominated by si and s are located above the @xmath2ni  -rich layers . the dominant element at @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is o. the progenitor c+o wd is almost entirely burned , and the mass of leftover unburned c is quite small ( @xmath104 at @xmath110 ) .",
    "the small mass of unburned c is consistent with the delayed detonation model .",
    "however , the mass of o derived for sn 2003du is larger than that in the delayed detonation model .",
    "these results suggest that in the outermost layers c - burning is more intense than in the deflagration model , but o burning is not as strong as in the delayed detonation models .",
    "the boundary between stable fe/@xmath2ni , @xmath2ni / ime , ime / o - rich layers is not as sharp as in the one - dimensional models , suggesting a moderate degree of mixing .",
