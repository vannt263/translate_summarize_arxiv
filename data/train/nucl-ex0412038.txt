    "extensive studies have demonstrated that semiperipheral heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies proceed through a dissipative binary reaction mechanism , characterized by early dynamical emission from an intermediate velocity source , followed by statistical evaporation from an excited projectile - like fragment and from an excited target - like fragment @xcite . in particular , this is true for the reverse kinematics reaction ar + al , investigated by several authors @xcite . in this paper",

    ", we investigate experimental two - particle correlation functions of protons , deuterons , tritons and @xmath0-particles .    from previous investigations , as well as from kinematical reasons , it is well known that semiperipheral collisions are dominated by plf emission at very forward angles ( see , e.g. , the study of lcp emission from @xmath2 = 60 mev @xmath3ar + @xmath4al collisions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present study , the experimental conditions of low detection thresholds , large dynamic range , fine granularity , and small angular separation between the centers of adjacent detectors , allows us to perform the correlation function analysis in a very forward angular range , 0.7@xmath1 .",
    "information about the emission times of the different particle types can be deduced from a model - independent analysis of the respective measured correlation functions . in particular , we aim to understand the order of emission of the lcps from the plf , by means of particle - velocity - gated correlation functions of non - identical particles @xcite .",
    "this adds an important and novel piece of information to the picture of the reaction mechanism emerging from previous studies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the relative importance of independent ( two- ) lcp emission from the plf , as compared to two - particle decay from unstable fragments emitted in the reaction .",
    "this is accomplished by comparing the strength of the corresponding resonance peaks in the correlation function at the two beam energies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief description of the experimental setup and event selection criteria ( sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ) , we present the results from the data analysis of the @xmath2 = 44 and 77 mev @xmath3ar + @xmath4al collisions .",

    ".  @xcite ) . a forward wall of 60 elements was placed between 0.7@xmath11 and 7@xmath11 in a honeycomb shape at a distance of 233 cm from the target ( solid angle 0.03 sr ) .",
    "the angular separation between the centers of two adjacent detectors was @xmath12 1.5@xmath11 .",
    "a backward wall of 18 phoswich elements was placed between 160@xmath11 and 175@xmath11 , at a distance of 50 cm from the target .",
    "finally , a battery of 30 phoswich elements was placed in plane , at angles between 10@xmath11 and 150@xmath11 , at a distance from the target variable from 50 to 200 cm .",

    "@xcite .",
    "identification of the reaction products was achieved via shape discrimination of the photomultiplier signals and time - of - flight technique @xcite .",
    "lcps ( @xmath13 = 1 and 2 ) were isotopically separated , while fragments with @xmath14 3 were identified in charge .",
    "the particle velocity was directly measured by means of time - of - flight technique .",
    "the experimental thresholds were set to 2 cm / ns for @xmath2 = 44 mev , and to 3 cm / ns for @xmath2 = 77 mev .",
    "the baf@xmath10 crystals , of variable thickness up to 10 cm , stopped protons of energy up to 200 mev .",
    "two slightly different trigger conditions were implemented in the two experiments . in the 44 mev experiment , events were recorded each time the in - plane detectors or the backward wall was fired , a minimum total multiplicity of 2 being registered . in the 77 mev experiment , instead , a coincidence between any two detectors was sufficient to start the data acquisition .    in this analysis , the event selection aims to choose semiperipheral collisions .",
    "this is achieved by requiring that the pairs of lcps ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath0 ) detected in the forward wall , must be in coincidence with one plf ( any fragment with atomic charge 3  @xmath18  18 and velocity within 70@xmath19 of the beam velocity ) also detected in the forward wall = 44 mev experiment , an additional particle detected in the plane or in the backward detectors is required , since this condition was implemented in the hardware trigger of that experiment . ] .",
    "the analysis of particle velocity spectra and of invariant cross - sections presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , indicates that this type of events is associated with semiperipheral binary collisions , where two sources , with velocities close to the initial velocity of the projectile and of the target nuclei , are formed .",
    "in addition , the mid - rapidity region is an abundant source of particles @xcite .",
    "the laboratory kinetic energy distributions of protons , deuterons , tritons , and @xmath0-particles , measured in the @xmath2 = 44 and 77 mev @xmath3ar + @xmath4al reactions , are shown in fig .",

    "the detection energy thresholds correspond to @xmath12 2 and 5 mev / nucleon for @xmath2 = 44 and 77 mev experiment , respectively .",
    "one can notice several qualitative features :    \\1 ) the spectra are dominated by a dumb - bell structure , displaying a minimum slightly below the beam energy .",
    "this behavior is typical of those particles ( from the isotropically emitting plf ) that have a velocity component either parallel to plf movement ( higher energy peak ) or antiparallel ( lower energy peak ) @xcite . because of the coulomb push from the plf",
    ", these particles will have an energy either higher or lower than the beam energy @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) in addition to plf emission , the spectra also contain contributions from an intermediate velocity source and from a target - like source @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) the dumb - bell structure in the energy spectra is more pronounced for @xmath15 and @xmath16 and it is slightly suppressed for @xmath17 and @xmath0 .",
    "this may be expected , since the coulomb push per particle experienced by an @xmath0-particle is less than half that experienced by a proton ( taking into account the mass and charge of the @xmath0-particle , and its larger average emission distance due to its larger size ) .",
    "in addition , the kinematical focusing at forward angles increases with the mass of the emitted particles , and it is strongest for @xmath0-particles @xcite . another effect for the smearing the dumb - bell structure may come from recoil effects .",
    "finally , a reduced dumb - bell shape may be caused by an enhanced contribution of non - plf decay mechanisms ( such as intermediate velocity source emission and secondary emission from the decay of highly excited primary fragments ) for @xmath17 and @xmath0 emission .",
    "indeed , the average relative intensity of intermediate velocity source emission is larger for @xmath0-particles than for protons , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath2 = 44 mev @xmath3ar + @xmath4al reaction .",
    "\\4 ) the dumb - bell shape associated with plf decay is slightly more pronounced at @xmath2 = 44 mev than at 77 mev .",
    "this is partly explained by the fact that the coulomb push becomes relatively less important at 77 mev , as compared to the boost from the source system to the laboratory system .",
    "in addition , it may be partly explained by an enhanced contribution of non - plf decay mechanisms at the higher energy ( intermediate velocity source emission and secondary decay ) @xcite .",
    "\\5 ) the yield of @xmath0-particles is rather large in this forward angular range .",
    "speculations on the origin of these copious @xmath0-particles have been discussed in refs .",
    "it could be due to the production in the reaction of excited light ions , and/or to the @xmath0 structure of the two interacting nuclei @xcite .",
    "the experimental correlation function is constructed by dividing the coincidence yield , @xmath20 , by the yield of uncorrelated events , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the relative momentum , @xmath8 is the reduced mass , and @xmath24 is the total momentum of the particle pair . in the following , an implicit integration over the six variables @xmath25 and @xmath26 is performed .",
    "the correlation function is normalized to unity at large values of @xmath27 , where no correlations are expected .",
    "the background yield , @xmath21 , can be constructed either from the product of the singles distributions @xcite or with the so - called `` event - mixing '' technique @xcite , combining particles from different events .",
    "we have verified that , for the present data set , the two techniques yield the same results , within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "thus , we have chosen to utilize the singles technique .    in the present analysis , only particles with energy / nucleon larger than a value slightly below the beam energy have been utilized to construct @xmath28 .",
    "this is because combining particles from both peaks of the dumb - bell shaped energy distributions ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) , introduces correlations other than two - body final state interactions and/or quantum symmetrization effects .",
    "these unwanted correlations most likely originate from a mixing of sources with different velocities . for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite . by applying this energy cut ,",
    "the contribution from the plf source relative to other sources is enhanced , while the statistics and the accessible range of relative momenta are reduced .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to the small angular separation between the centers of two adjacent detectors ( @xmath12 1.5@xmath11 ) , the region of small relative momenta ( where interesting signatures of final state interactions and antisymmetrization effects appear ) is still populated .",
    "before we proceed to analyze the experimental results , we would like to point out that , for those correlation functions characterized by final state interaction leading to resonances , the resonance peaks may a priori have two different origins @xcite :    \\i ) from processes where an unstable fragment formed in the reaction decays into the two measured particles .",
    "if the secondary decay of a specific fragment produces two particles that are measured in coincidence ( like in e.g.  @xmath29be @xmath30 or @xmath31li @xmath32 @xmath0 + @xmath16 ) , the decay will give rise to a resonance peak in the corresponding correlation function .",
    "\\ii ) from interactions between independently emitted particles .",
    "de - excitation of the plf and secondary decay of excited fragments may produce particles are measured in coincidence . the relative distance for most such pairs",
    "will be large ( in both space and time ) and they will interact weakly .",
    "this means that they will give rise to correlation effects mainly at small relative momenta @xcite .",

    "the maximum at 20 mev / c may be seen as the resonance peak from the decay of the particle unstable @xmath36he .",
    "the minimum at @xmath37 0 mev / c is due to the interplay between quantum antisymmetrization effects and final state coulomb repulsion between the two protons @xcite .",

    "most probably , the bump contains additional contributions from a background of @xmath15 and @xmath0-particles emitted independently from source de - excitation ( the large yields of @xmath15 and @xmath0 @xcite enhance the probability that two such particles are emitted close enough in time that they will experience strong final state interaction ) .",
    "the very similar behavior of the two @xmath33 and @xmath38 correlation functions at @xmath2 = 44 and 77 mev , indicates that the characteristics of plf proton and @xmath0-particle emission are rather independent of the beam energy .",
    "as demonstrated by the statistical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , different emitted particles from the plf are sensitive to different portions of the plf de - excitation cascade . because of the coulomb barrier and of the binding energy relative to the available excitation of the plf , the emission time distribution of protons and @xmath0-particles is expected to be rather flat . in the calculations of @xcite , the emission time distribution exhibited by @xmath0-particles",
    "is found to decrease by only a factor of 3 over the time interval of 150 fm / c , while other particles ( e.g.   tritons ) exhibit steeper distributions , decreasing more than one order of magnitude in the same time interval .",
    "thus , protons and @xmath0-particles are expected to sample the end of plf de - excitation cascade , and this effect is expected to be approximately the same at 44 and at 77 a mev . in addition , there might be a large background of independently emitted protons and @xmath0-particles from secondary decay of excited fragments , also probing the long time scale .",

    "the two particle velocities are determined by momentum conservation , and , in the rest system of the decaying fragment , the lightest particle will always get the highest velocity .",
    "therefore , the expected behavior for particle pairs coming from a two - body decay of a decaying fragment is the following : the velocity - gated correlation function , obtained with the condition that the lightest particle has the largest velocity , should exhibit the strongest correlation or anticorrelation .",

    "this indicates that the relative abundance of light particles ( in particular @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) as compared to heavy fragments ( in particular @xmath29be , @xmath45li , and @xmath31li ) is larger at @xmath2 = 77 mev than at @xmath2 = 44 mev .    the correlation functions of non - identical particle pairs have been utilized to deduce the particle emission time sequence in a model independent way , based on particle - velocity - gated correlation functions .    for correlation functions characterized by final state interaction leading to resonances , care has to be taken to deduce information on the emission time sequence from independently emitted particles ( discarding particles coming from resonance decays )",
    "this can be achieved in two ways : + i ) with particle - velocity gates in regions of relative momentum where there are no resonant states that directly lead to the formation of the particle pair .",
    "+ ii ) with particle - velocity gates in regions of the relative momentum where there is a resonance peak , but the peak is not dominated by particles coming from resonance decay .",
    "when a resonance peak is dominated by particles coming from resonance decay , momentum conservation implies that the correlation is stronger for the particle - velocity - gated correlation function with the velocity of the lighter particle larger than the velocity of the heavier particle .",
    "violation of this condition is a signature that the peak is dominated by independently emitted particles , and can thus be utilized to deduce the particle emission time sequence .",
    "the results from the particle - velocity - gated correlation function analysis indicate that , at both bombarding energies , @xmath0-particles have an average emission time shorter than protons but longer than deuterons and tritons .",
    "this finding is consistent with the emerging picture of a plf that is de - excited by early emission of tritons and deuterons followed by @xmath0-particles and protons .",
    "indeed , because of the coulomb barrier and of the binding energy relative to the available excitation of the plf , the emission time distribution of protons and @xmath0-particles is expected to be less steep than that of @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the deduced lcp emission time sequence appears to be in qualitative agreement with previous experimental findings from three - moving source fits to single particle energy spectra in @xmath2 = 44 and 60 mev @xmath3ar + @xmath4al collisions @xcite .",
    "the plf source temperatures deduced from these fits were found to be lowest for protons ( 3.6 mev at 44 a mev , 4.9 mev at 60 a mev ) , followed by @xmath0-particles ( 4.7 mev at 44 a mev , 6.9 mev at 60 a mev ) , then deuterons ( 5.0 mev at 44 a mev , 8.5 mev at 60 a mev ) and tritons ( 5.9 mev at 44 a mev , 8.5 mev at 60 a mev ) .",
    "these findings were interpreted as a suggestion that an important fraction of @xmath0-particles is emitted in the final stage of the collision .",
    "different hypotheses have been advanced to explain this late emission of @xmath0-particles , including the concept of @xmath0-clusterization of nuclei @xcite and the production of @xmath0-particles by secondary decay of light fragments produced in the collisions @xcite .",
    "the qualitative interpretations of the data analysis given in the present paper should be supported by comparisons to statistical model calculations .",
    "such model comparisons will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
