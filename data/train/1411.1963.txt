    "non - axisymmetric deformations of rapidly rotating self - gravitating objects are a generic phenomenon in nature and are expected to appear in a wide range of astrophysical scenarios , like stellar core collapses  @xcite , accretion - induced collapses of white dwarfs  @xcite , or mergers of two neutron stars  @xcite . over more than a decade , a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the search of unstable deformations that , even when starting from an axisymmetric configuration , can lead to a highly deformed , rapidly rotating , massive object  @xcite . in the case of neutron stars",
    ", such deformations would lead to an intense emission of gravitational waves in the khz range , potentially detectable on earth within the next decade  @xcite by next - generation gravitational - wave detectors such as advanced ligo  @xcite , advanced virgo , or kagra  @xcite .",
    "any insight on the possible astrophysical scenarios where such instabilities might be present would aid potential observations and their analysis and understanding .",
    "it is well - known that rotating neutron stars are subject to non - axisymmetric instabilities for non - radial axial modes with azimuthal dependence @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) when the instability parameter @xmath3 ( i.e. the ratio between the kinetic rotational energy @xmath4 and the gravitational potential energy @xmath5 ) exceeds a certain critical value @xmath6 .",
    "this instability parameter plays an important role in the study of the so - called dynamical bar - mode instability , i.e. the @xmath7 instability which takes place when @xmath8 is larger than the threshold @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "previous results for the onset of the classical bar - mode instability have already shown that the critical value @xmath6 for the onset of the instability is not a universal quantity and it is strongly influenced by the rotational profile  @xcite , by relativistic effects  @xcite , and , in a quantitative way , by the compactness  @xcite .    however , until the recent work in  @xcite , significant evidence of their presence when realistic eoss are considered was missing .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , using the unified sly eos  @xcite , the presence of a shear - instability was shown , but there was no sign of the classical bar - mode instability and its critical behavior .",
    "the aim of the present work is to get more insight into the behavior of the classical bar - mode instability when the matter is described by eoss with different stiffness .",
    "the investigations in the literature into its dependence on the stiffness of eoss usually focused on values of @xmath0 ( i.e. the adiabatic index of a polytropic eos ) in the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10  @xcite , while the expected value for a real neutron star is more likely higher , between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and probably around @xmath12 ( at least in large portions of the interior ) .",
    "such a choice for the eos was already implemented in  @xcite , and also quite recently in  @xcite .",
    "its benefit is the ability to maintain the simplicity of a polytropic eos and yet to obtain properties that resemble a more realistic case . indeed , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eoss ] , a polytropic eos with @xmath13 and @xmath12 is qualitatively similar to the shen proposal  @xcite in the density interval between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while a polytropic eos with @xmath16 and @xmath17 approximately resembles the sly eos for densities higher than @xmath18 .     vs. the energy density @xmath19 for all polytropic eoss considered and two _ realistic _",
    "eoss for nuclear matter , namely ( 1 ) the shen proposal  @xcite ; ( 2 ) the unified sly prescription  @xcite .",
    "the polytropic eos with @xmath12 is close to the shen eos , while the case of @xmath20 is close to the sly eos , both above a certain density.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : results ] we present and discuss our results , showing the features of the evolution and quantifying the effects of the compactness on the onset of the instability .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . throughout this paper we use a space - like signature @xmath21 , with greek indices running from 0 to 3 , latin indices from 1 to 3 , and the standard convention for summation over repeated indices .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all quantities are expressed in units in which @xmath22 .",
    "we follow the same setup as in  @xcite ( only changing the eos parameters @xmath0 and @xmath23 ) , but for convenience the main ideas are summarized in the following section .    in this work",
    "we solve einstein s field equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the einstein tensor of the four - dimensional metric @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the stress - energy tensor of an ideal fluid .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath27 can be parametrized as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the rest - mass density , @xmath30 is the specific internal energy of the matter , @xmath31 is the pressure , and @xmath32 is the matter @xmath33-velocity .",
    "the evolution equations for the matter follow from the conservation laws for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath34 and the baryon number @xmath35 , closed by an eos of the type @xmath36 .    in order to generate the initial data",
    ", we use a @xmath0-type eos of the form @xmath37 where the following relation between @xmath30 and @xmath29 holds : @xmath38 . on the other hand",
    ", the evolution is performed using the so - called _ ideal - fluid _ ( @xmath0-law )",
    "eos @xmath39 that allows for increase of the internal energy by shock heating , if shocks are present .",
    "we solve the above set of equations using the usual @xmath40 space - time decomposition , where the space - time is foliated as a tensor product of a three - space and a time coordinate @xmath41 ( which is selected to be the @xmath42 coordinate ) . in this coordinate system",
    "the metric can be split as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 has only the spatial components different from zero and can be used to define a riemannian metric @xmath45 on each foliation .",
    "the vector @xmath46 , that determines the direction normal to the 3-hypersurfaces of the foliation , is decomposed in terms of the lapse function @xmath47 and the shift vector @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 .",
    "we also define the fluid three - velocity @xmath50 as the velocity measured by a local zero - angular momentum observer ( @xmath51 ) , while the lorentz factor is @xmath52 . within this formalism , the conservation of the baryon number suggests the use of the conserved variable @xmath53 with the property that @xmath54 along the time - evolution @xmath41 .",
    "the initial data of our simulations are calculated as stationary equilibrium solutions for axisymmetric and rapidly rotating relativistic stars in polar coordinates  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the metric describing the axisymmetric and stationary relativistic star has the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are space - dependent metric functions .",
    "similarly , we assume the matter to be characterized by a non - uniform angular velocity distribution of the form @xmath60 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the equatorial stellar coordinate radius , @xmath62 is the angular velocity at the center of the star , and the coefficient @xmath63 is the measure of the degree of the differential rotation , which we set to be @xmath64 , analogous to works in the literature , and especially  @xcite .",
    "once imported onto the cartesian grid , throughout the evolution we compute the coordinate angular velocity @xmath65 on the @xmath66 plane as @xmath67 other characteristic quantities of the system such as the baryon mass @xmath68 , the gravitational mass @xmath69 , the internal energy @xmath70 , the angular momentum @xmath71 , the rotational kinetic energy @xmath4 , the gravitational binding energy @xmath5 and the instability parameter @xmath8 are defined as  @xcite : @xmath72     \\beta & \\equiv t/|w| \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the square root of the four - dimensional metric determinant .",
    "notice that the definitions of quantities such as @xmath71 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 are meaningful only in the case of stationary axisymmetric configurations and should therefore be treated with care once the rotational symmetry is lost .",
    "all the equilibrium models considered here have been calculated using the relativistic polytropic eos given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eosp_gamma ] ) , and we have chosen the polytropic eos parameters to be @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 $ ] for the adiabatic index , and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 $ ] for the polytropic constant respectively .",
    "this choice allows , for each pair of @xmath0 and @xmath23 , a maximum neutron star mass of @xmath84 .",
    "the exception is @xmath12 , where simulation data from  @xcite , which allows for higher masses , were re - used to save computation time , given their identical numerical setup .",
    "note that these values are different from the ones used in  @xcite ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "note , however , that the choice of @xmath23 does not change the results presented in this work .",
    "the actual value of the polytropic constant @xmath23 fixes the overall scale of the physical system ; i.e. the assertion that we are generating and simulating a model with a given baryonic mass @xmath68 is related to the value chosen for @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , in order to claim that the threshold for the instability depends on the stiffness of the eos , we need to eliminate the dependencies on the dimensional scales as well as on the chosen value of the polytropic constant @xmath23 . an efficient way to do so is to extrapolate the result for @xmath86 , which corresponds to the newtonian limit , where the general relativistic effects can be neglected . using the same procedure followed in  @xcite , we choose sequences of constant rest - mass density models among the following possible values for the total baryon mass @xmath68 ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath76 @xmath91 ) .",
    "we restrict the values of the instability parameter @xmath8 to the range @xmath92 $ ] , and we leave the analysis of models with lower values to future work .",
    "the initial conditions for the evolution have been generated using nicholas stergioulas rns code  @xcite .",
    "any model can be uniquely determined by three parameters ( once the value of the differential rotation parameter has been fixed to @xmath93 ) .",
    "we have decided to denote each of the generated models using the values of the adiabatic index @xmath0 , the conserved baryonic mass @xmath68 , and the @xmath8 parameter at @xmath94 . as a consequence of this choice , in the rest of this paper we will refer to a particular model using the following notation .",
    "for example , g2.00m1.5b0.270 will denote a model with an adiabatic index of @xmath90 , a conserved baryonic mass @xmath95 and a value of the initial instability parameter @xmath96 .",
    "one of the main features of the generated models is that , due to the high rotation , none of them have the density maximum at the center of the star , but rather at some distance from it .",
    "this means that all of the models studied are characterized by a _",
    "toroidal _ configuration ,",
    "i.e. the maximum of the density is not on the rotational axis .",
    "as has been shown in  @xcite , there is not always a correlation between having a toroidal configuration and being unstable against the dynamical bar - mode instability .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     results using different polytropic exponents @xmath0 can not be directly compared to each other to infer the effects of considering a stiffer eos .",
    "the issue is that when considering a polytropic eos , one can change the units of measurement in such a way that the value of the polytropic constant @xmath23 is @xmath9 .",
    "this means that by changing this value one effectively changes the mass scale and , in turn , the mass of the stellar model considered .",
    "indeed , the assertion that for a star with mass @xmath97 the threshold for the onset of the bar - mode instability is reduced to @xmath98 for @xmath12 from the higher value of @xmath99 for @xmath100 is susceptible to the choice of the mass scale determined by the choice of the values of the polytropic constants .",
    "the dependence on the choice of the mass scale can be eliminated by going to the zero - mass limit that corresponds to performing an extrapolation to the _ newtonian _ limit of the results .",
    "this can be achieved by a linear fit of the reported values for the critical @xmath6 for the onset of the classical bar - mode instability in tab .",
    "( [ tab : growthtimes ] ) as a function of the baryonic rest - mass ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : growthtimes ] ) .",
    "the result for this fit leads to the following expression for the critical @xmath6 as a function of the the total baryonic mass @xmath68 : @xmath101 with different values of the constant depending on the adiabatic index @xmath0 .",
    "these values are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : betac ] and shown on the bottom right box of figure [ fig : growthtimes ] .",
    "the extrapolated values for @xmath6 in the limit of zero baryonic mass for the relativistic stellar models then lead to a dependency on the compactness of the star alone , expressed as dependency on @xmath0 , shown in figure  [ fig : newtonianlimit_vs_gamma ] . as can be seen there",
    ", the dependency of @xmath6 on @xmath0 is , within errors , linear in the range @xmath102 $ ] , while lower values of @xmath0 deviate notably .",
    "we also show results from  @xcite , using @xmath100 ( and @xmath103 ) , which show a similar deviation .",
    "the fact that the case of @xmath100 is special is not a surprise since in the newtonian limit , i.e. , for small values of central density the equilibrium configuration ( see @xcite ) of a non - rotational polytrope are described by the lane - emden equation , and the radius of the star @xmath104 and its total mass @xmath69 are related to the central density @xmath105 as @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "that means that the two values @xmath108 and @xmath10 are very special and represent the transition points to different behavior of the properties of the associated stellar models .",
    "in fact , for @xmath109 we see that the mass decreases for increasing central density , and the models can not be stable , while @xmath110 marks a transition point in the relation between the radius of the star and the central density .",
    "our results show that the dependency of the threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar - mode instability on @xmath0 is not as large as the previously published results for @xmath100  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite alone suggested , at least not close to the interesting value of @xmath12 .",
    "further investigation is necessary to clarify the exact dependency at values of @xmath0 lower than @xmath75 .",
    "we have presented a study of the dynamical bar - mode instability in differentially rotating nss in full general relativity for a wide and systematic range of values of the rotational parameter @xmath8 and the conserved baryonic mass @xmath68 , using a polytropic / ideal - fluid eos characterized by a range of values of the adiabatic index @xmath111 , and @xmath78 $ ] . in particular , we have evolved a large number of ns models belonging to twenty - one different sequences with a constant rest - mass ranging from @xmath87 to @xmath112 , with a fixed degree of differential rotation ( @xmath64 ) , and with many different values of @xmath8 in the range @xmath113 $ ] .    for all the models with a sufficiently high initial value of @xmath8 we observe the expected exponential growth of the @xmath7 mode which is characteristic of the development of the dynamical bar - mode instability .",
    "we compute the growth time @xmath114 for each of these bar - mode unstable models by performing a nonlinear least - square fit using a trial function for the quadrupole moment of the matter distribution .",
    "the growth time clearly depends on both the rest - mass and the rotation and in particular we find , in agreement with previous studies  @xcite , that the relation between the instability parameter @xmath8 and the inverse square of @xmath114 , for each sequence of constant rest - mass , is linear .",
    "this allows us to extrapolate the threshold value , @xmath6 , for each sequence corresponding to the growth time going to infinity , using the same procedure already employed in @xcite .",
    "once the five values of @xmath6 for each value of @xmath0 have been computed , we are able to show that the dependency of @xmath6 on @xmath0 is , within errors , close to linear ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : newtonianlimit_vs_gamma ] ) in the the range @xmath115 . from this , we are able to perform a fit , predicting @xmath6 for a given value of @xmath0 between @xmath75 and @xmath11 : @xmath116 however , we would like to stress that this should only be taken as rough estimate . in particular we do not claim an actual linear dependency of @xmath6 on @xmath0 in this range .",
    "very likely the dependency is more complex .",
    "further investigations are needed to clarify the full dependency of @xmath6 on @xmath0 , especially for values of @xmath0 between @xmath90 and @xmath75 .",
