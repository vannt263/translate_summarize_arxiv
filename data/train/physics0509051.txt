    "time projection chambers ( tpcs ) have been an important part of many large particle physics experiments since their initial development in the 1970 s .",
    "@xcite traditionally , ionization tracks are imaged at the endplates with wire grids , which provide gas amplification , and pads .",
    "the signals sensed on anode wires and cathode pads are predominantly due to the motion of positive ions away from the gas amplification region .",
    "when operated in a magnetic field parallel to the drift field , the momentum resolution of the device is limited by non - zero * e*@xmath0*b *  @xcite in the vicinity of the wire grids . the multi - track resolution is limited by the wide pad response function and the slow drift velocity of the positive ions .    a time projection chamber is a leading candidate to be the main tracker for an international linear collider experiment .",
    "@xcite in order to improve the momentum and multi - track resolutions , as required by the physics objectives , it has been proposed that the wire grids be replaced by a micropattern gas avalanche detector , such as a gas electron multiplier ( gem )  @xcite or micromegas  @xcite . for these types of devices , * e*@xmath0*b * can be negligibly small . furthermore , since the pad signals are due to the motion of electrons as they approach and arrive on the readout pads , the spatial extent of the signals can be much narrower and their risetimes much faster , thereby improving the multi - track resolution .",
    "in fact , the signals can be so narrow as to present a challenge for conventional pad readout in a large detector . the outer radius of a linear collider experiment main tracker is envisaged to be approximately 2  m and to keep electronics costs reasonable , the readout pads need to be no smaller than about 2  mm  @xmath0  6  mm .",
    "@xcite a strong magnetic field of 4  t is being considered to reach the momentum resolution goal . in this magnetic field",
    ", gases with fast drift velocity at low drift fields can have transverse diffusion contants of about 30  @xmath1m/@xmath2 . to achieve optimal transverse resolution with 2  mm wide pads , a mechanism to defocus the drifting electron charge cloud after amplification is required , so that the signals are sampled by at least 2 pads per row .",
    "one way to defocus the charge cloud is to use gas diffusion between the gem foils and the readout pads . in these regions",
    "the electric field can be much larger and by selecting an appropriate gas , the diffusion constant can be much larger there than in the drift region .",
    "this is the method that is investigated in the work reported here .",
    "ideally , the defocusing should be sufficient so that the standard deviation of the charge clouds should be at least @xmath3 of the pad width , as explained in appendix  [ chargesharing ] .",
    "an alternative defocusing method , particularly well suited for micromegas devices , is to place a resistive foil above the pads .  @xcite    the remaining sections of the paper describe studies with a tpc consisting of a drift volume coupled to a double gem structure and conventional pads . in section  [ system ] , the design and general properties of the tpc and the laser delivery system are described .",
    "the data samples collected with this device are summarized in section  [ data ] , and the general properties of the data are shown .",
    "section  [ simul ] describes a program used to simulate cosmic and laser tracks in the tpc , which was used to develop and test reconstruction algorithms . in section  [ trackfitting ]",
    "the methods employed to fit tracks of ionization in the tpc are described in detail .",
    "section  [ results ] shows the performance of the tpc , as measured under a variety of operating conditions , and compares these to results from simulations .",
    "after gaining experience operating a 15  cm drift length tpc with gem readout without magnetic fields  @xcite , a new tpc was designed with a 30  cm drift length , specifically to be deployed in magnets available for use at the triumf and desy laboratories in 2003 . following successful cosmic ray tests in the magnets that year ,",
    "a laser delivery system was constructed for further tests with the tpc in the desy magnet in 2004 .",
    "the tpc is a cylindrical design , constructed primarily with acrylic .",
    "the drift length is 30  cm with a field cage of brass hoops with a pitch of 5  mm held in slots in an acrylic holder .",
    "the potentials of the hoops are provided by a chain of 10  m@xmath4 surface mount resistors in the gas volume .",
    "the cathode endpiece is a circular piece of g10 with copper cladding .",
    "the other end of the drift volume is terminated by a circular endpiece with a 10  cm square hole , equal to the size of the gem foils .",
    "the endpiece has copper cladding , and narrow wires strung across the hole , to provide a well defined termination of the electric field .",
    "the drift volume section of the tpc is inserted into an outer acrylic cylinder , with an outer diameter of 8.75 in . a readout module , holding a pad array constructed on a printed circuit board and two gem foils , is inserted into the cylinder on the other end , to make a closed gas volume .",
    "the readout and drift modules design drawings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpcpieces ] .     , height=192 ]      a schematic diagram of the high voltage configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hvsystem ] . all resistors shown",
    "are installed in a hv distribution box , except for the field cage network , which are surface mount resistors located in the tpc volume .",
    "the hv distribution box also contained 100  k@xmath4 shunt resistors on one line to each gem , to which isolated digital voltmeters are attached .",
    "this allowed for current monitoring at the level of 1  na on each gem .    .",
    "the 100  m@xmath4 drain resistance is provided so that different drift fields can be applied without the lower supply sinking current .",
    "( c ) the high voltage distribution for the gem foils . the 1001 m@xmath4 resistances indicate the 1000:1 dividers for monitoring the voltages .",
    "not shown are the isolated voltmeters across shunts to monitor the gem currents .",
    "[ fig : hvsystem ] , height=192 ]    during data taking , electric fields in the drift volume were 90 - 250  v / cm , chosen to maximize the drift velocity , and the field between the drift endpiece and gem  1 was 10  v / cm larger .",
    "the transfer field between the two gems was about 2.5  kv / cm , and the induction field to the readout pads was about 3.5  kv / cm .",
    "the potential across each gem was 370 - 380  v , providing an effective gas gain of the system in the range 5 - 8@xmath5 .",
    "an array of rectangular readout pads , roughly 10  mm@xmath6 in area are laid out on a printed circuit board , arranged in rows of 31 or 32 pads across .",
    "the pads are at nominal ground potential , and each row is connected to a front end card developed for the star tpc  @xcite .",
    "the card contains charge sensitive preamplifiers - shapers and when a trigger is received , the amplified signals are sampled and stored into a 512 time bin switched capacitor array . the card was modified to increase the pedestal to allow negative going pulses to be sampled with a large dynamic range .",
    "the signals are digitized asynchronously and 10  bits per channel per 50  ns time bin are stored in the raw data files . for cosmic ray studies ,",
    "trigger signals are formed from the coincidence of scintillator paddles placed above and below the tpc . for laser studies ,",
    "trigger signals are provided by a photodiode .      in order to perform controlled studies of the gem tpc ,",
    "a laser delivery system was constructed for use in the desy magnet system with an ultraviolet ( 266  nm wavelength ) nd : yag laser .",
    "the system is able to provide a single beam or a pair of beams to the tpc perpendicular to the drift direction , at any location along the drift distance , under remote control .",
    "the tpc outer acrylic tube was fitted with long quartz windows to accept the laser light .",
    "a schematic drawing is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : laser ] .     , height=240 ]",
    "the beam from the laser is reflected by two fused silica slides ( each with the back face sandblasted to reduce ghost reflections ) to reduce the beam intensity and focused by a @xmath7  mm plano - concave lens followed by a @xmath8  mm plano - convex lens .",
    "the beam is split , with the reflected beam providing a fixed direction , and the through going beam reflected off a movable mirror to provide a second beam parallel to the fixed beam .",
    "the separation of the two beams can be adjusted to between 0 and 12  mm .",
    "beam blockers can move into or out of either beam to provide a single beam to the tpc .    when the tpc is placed in the laser delivery system holder ,",
    "a movable splitter and mirror are underneath the tpc to reflect the beam into the tpc volume at two drift distances simultaneously .",
    "the splitter can be rotated out of the beam so that the light enters at only one drift distance .",
    "a steering mirror was also in place to allow a transverse separation of beams that enter at two drift distances .",
    "remote control was provided through the use of servos and stepper motors controlled via the serial and parallel ports of the data acquisition computer .",
    "operation under remote control was necessary for personal safety considerations regarding the strong magnetic field and the ultraviolet laser .",
    "in 2003 , cosmic ray data were collected at a variety of magnetic field strengths for two different gas mixtures : p5 ( ar : ch@xmath9 95:5 ) and a mixture referred to as tdr - gas ( ar : ch@xmath9:co@xmath10 95:3:2 ) .",
    "the pad pitch was 2  mm  @xmath0  7  mm .",
    "initial tests were performed in the 1  t warm magnet at triumf followed by a longer data taking period in the superconducting magnet at desy .",
    "two of the electronics cards were faulty during much of the data taking run , but 6  rows were found to provide sufficient information to characterize the tracking resolution performance .    in 2004 ,",
    "cosmic ray and laser calibration data were collected primarily at a magnetic field of 4  t at desy , with the same two gas mixtures .",
    "two readout pad boards were used : the original with 2  mm  @xmath0  7  mm pads , and a new board with 1.2  mm  @xmath0  7  mm pads . the study with the narrower pads",
    "was performed because it was found in the 2003 run that neither gas provides adequate defocusing between the gem foils for the 2  mm wide pads at high magnetic fields .",
    "gas mixtures with higher concentrations of methane , such as p10 , could provide the required defocusing at 4  t , but this gas was not permitted in the desy magnet test area .",
    "the initial data taking in 2004 was with the wider pads , after which the tpc was briefly opened to insert the narrow pad plane .",
    "the data taking started with p5 gas when it was found that the drift velocity at 90 v / cm , where it is expected to be maximum , was found to be much lower than expected and increasing with time . by operating at 160  v / cm ,",
    "the drift velocity was maximised and found to be stable .",
    "after the data taking period was completed , it was found that long lengths of the gaslines were copper that had been previously exposed to atmosphere , and a gas analyzer showed that under these conditions , significant amounts of water remain in the system for a few weeks after starting the gas flow .",
    "the drift velocity and diffusion of tdr gas is less sensitive to water .",
    "the 2003 data had several faulty electronics channels , unlike the 2004 data , and since the laser system was only incorporated for the 2004 data set , the focus of the data analysis reported in this paper is on the 2004 data samples , summarized in table  [ tab : datasamples ] .    .",
    "list of cosmic data samples recorded in 2004 , in order of data taking .",
    "the name assigned to the each configuration is referred to in subsequent tables .",
    "the first data set likely contained a large concentration of water . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : zresol ]",
    "the results presented in this paper indicate that a gem tpc with pad readout is a viable candidate for the central tracker for an experiment at the international linear collider .",
    "when operated in a 4  t magnetic field with modest size pads , a full size tpc could collect some 200 pad - row measurements each with transverse spatial resolution of approximately 100  @xmath1 m , which should be sufficient to achieve the transverse momentum resolution goal of @xmath11  ( gev / c)@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite in addition , the resolution does not degrade significantly for nearby tracks , provided their separation is more than about 1.5  times the pad width .",
    "the relatively simple simulation package reproduces many of the general features seen in the data .",
    "it should be useful , therefore , in optimizing the configuration of gem tpcs for future experiments at the ilc and elsewhere .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the assistance from the desy laboratory in providing the superconducting magnet test facility and the uv laser , and we especially thank thorsten lux and peter wienemann for assistance at the laboratory .",
    "we would like to thank michael ronan for providing the star tpc electronics used in this work .",
    "the work of vance strickland in designing and constructing the tpc and mark lenckowski in designing and constructing the laser delivery system was invaluable .",
    "we were assisted by undergraduate students , brie hoffman , camille belanger - champagne , and chris nell , and by technical staff at the university of victoria and triumf .",
    "our work benefited from collaboration with the tpc group at carleton university and the worldwide lc - tpc group .",
    "this work was supported by a grant by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "consider a charge cloud of @xmath13 electrons arriving at the gem plane .",
    "due to diffusion in the drift volume , the electrons are distributed in the transverse direction , @xmath14 , with standard deviation @xmath15 . if the gems provide a gain @xmath16 ( with negligible variance ) , the defocusing adds a variance @xmath17 to the @xmath14 distribution , and if the @xmath14 coordinate of all of the resulting electrons are measured with no uncertainty , then the variance of the mean @xmath14 coordinate is @xmath18    to achieve the diffusion limit , the gem term ( the second term ) must be much smaller than the diffusion term . in reality , the gem term has additional contributions from the variance in the gain , and the uncertainties in measuring the @xmath14 coordinates for each electron .    in a gem - tpc the @xmath14",
    "coordinate for each electron is not measured , but rather the charge shared by neighbouring pads is used to deduce the mean @xmath14 coordinate . the degradation in resolution due to using large pads",
    "can be understood analytically .",
    "consider two neighbouring semi - infinite pads with the boundary at @xmath19 .",
    "if the electrons are distributed according to the pdf @xmath20 , the expectation for the fraction of electrons over the positive-@xmath14 pad is @xmath21 if @xmath20 is gaussian , with mean @xmath1 , standard deviation @xmath22 , the estimate @xmath23 determined from the observed fraction @xmath24 has variance , @xmath25 where the variance of @xmath24 is binomial , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the number of electrons . if @xmath28 , so that the mean of the pdf is at the border between the pads , the variance on the estimate @xmath23 is @xmath29 or in other words a factor 1.6 larger than the variance that would result in perfect @xmath14 coordinate measurements for each electron . as the mean of the pdf moves away from the pad boundary",
    ", the variance gets larger ; for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) the factor increases to 2.3 ( 9.0 ) . to keep the gem contribution to the resolution small",
    ", the pad width needs to be less than about 3 - 4 @xmath22 , so that @xmath1 is less than 1.5 - 2 @xmath22 .",
    "the effects of noise and thresholds may limit the pad sizes even further .",
    "the maximum likelihood track fit uses a simple model to describe the way electrons are spread about the readout pads .",
    "due to diffusion , the electrons are assumed to be distributed in a guassian fashion about the projection of the particle trajectory onto the readout pad plane .",
    "the resulting `` line - gaussian '' density function is a convolution of the `` trajectory density function '' and a two dimensional isotropic gaussian probability density function .",
    "the standard deviation of the gaussian , @xmath22 , is a free parameter in the fit , like the other track parameters .",
    "the fitted value provides an estimate of the diffusion for each event . for simplicity in the analysis",
    ", @xmath22 is assumed to be constant along the the length of the track , a good approximation for the data samples described in this paper .",
    "the implementation of this model assumes that rectangular pads of equal height are arranged in a parallel fashion into horizontal rows and that tracks cross several rows .",
    "the height of the row is assumed to be much smaller than the radius of curvature , so that the tracks can be considered to be straight within the vertical extent of the row .",
    "the true trajectory density function ( tdf ) for a typical track is non - uniform along its path due to ionization fluctuations .",
    "the model , however , assumes that within a row , the tdf is uniform .",
    "the likelihood , @xmath32 , of observing the distribution of charge is calculated for each row , and the product of the likelihoods for all the rows defines the overall likelihood function , @xmath33 . in this way , the model implicitly allows the tdf to vary from row to row .",
    "the expected charge collected by a rectangular pad is determined by integrating a uniform line - gaussian density function over the physical region of the pad and is proportional to : @xmath34 ^ 2\\over 2\\sigma^2}\\right ) \\\\ & & \\\\ & = & \\eta(b,\\phi,\\sigma , h , w ) - \\eta(b,\\phi,\\sigma ,- h , w ) \\\\ & & + \\eta(b,\\phi,\\sigma ,- h ,- w ) - \\eta(b,\\phi,\\sigma , h ,- w ) \\\\ & & \\\\ \\eta(b,\\phi,\\sigma , h , w ) & = & \\displaystyle{{1\\over\\cos\\phi\\sin\\phi }       \\xi\\left(\\left(b+{w\\over2}\\right)\\cos\\phi+{h\\over2}\\sin\\phi,\\sigma\\right ) } \\\\ & & \\\\",

    "the local azimuthal angle for a row centred at @xmath39 is @xmath40 the horizontal distance to the track from the pad centred at @xmath41 in that row , can be expressed in a power series of @xmath42 as @xmath43    in order to calculate the likelihood of the observed charge distribution in a single row , an approximate model is used .",
    "the model is developed on the basis that signals in a row result from a relatively small number , @xmath44 , of electrons liberated in the ionization process that are subsequently amplified in the gem structure .",
    "as an approximation , the distribution of charge is assumed to be multinomial with @xmath27 observations .",
    "this approximation is exact in the limit that the diffusion within and after the gem structure is small compared to the diffusion in the drift region , the fluctuations due to electronics noise is small compared to that due to primary electron statistics , and that thresholds are small .",
    "this model was initially developed to study data from tests without magnetic fields , in which the dominant contribution to diffusion was in the drift volume . for certain gases and operating conditions in strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the situation is reversed , whereby the diffusion primarily arises in the gem structure .",
    "in fact this feature is desirable in order to ensure that there is good charge sharing across relatively large pads , as described in section  [ intro ] .",
    "nevertheless , the model performs very well in either circumstance .    if @xmath45 electrons are collected by pad @xmath46 for a system with total gem gain , @xmath16 , the equivalent number of the original ionization electrons associated to the pad is simply defined as @xmath47 these values are non - integer , but a direct continuum extension of the multinomial distribution , yields the log likelihood function , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the probability for a primary electron from the track to be associated to pad @xmath46 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 runs over all pads in the row containing pad @xmath46 .    a spurious signal in a pad",
    "far from the track can cause problems for the likelihood calculation , since the calculated probability for electrons to be present there can be vanishingly small . to make the track fit robust to spurious signals , the probability for a primary electron to be associated with a pad is modified by adding a small constant , @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of pads in the row .",
    "the fitted track parameter values , apart from @xmath22 , are found not to strongly depend on the choice of @xmath52 , for the data analyzed in this paper , where @xmath55 .",
    "the method used in this paper to form the estimated single row resolution ( essr ) has been tested using simulated samples and laser data .    for simulated samples ,",
    "the true values of the track parameters are known .",
    "events were simulated with the ionization following a straight trajectory , and the resulting pad signals were fit to straight tracks ( fixing @xmath56 ) . the resolution is directly determined from the standard deviation of the residuals of the fit @xmath57 values with respect to the true values .",
    "the direct single row resolution is defined to be @xmath58 times this standard deviation , since 8 rows are used in the fit .",
    "the esrr is found to agree with the direct result to within 10% . when the same data is fit to curved tracks ( allowing @xmath42 to float ) , the esrr is unaffected , but the standard deviation of the residuals for the direct result increases due to the correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath42 .",
    "laser data was used in a similar way to check the esrr .",
    "it was found that the laser system was quite steady ; the mean of the @xmath57 from track fits to the laser data typically drifted by less than 10  @xmath1 m over a period of 12 hours . in the data with two laser beams present at large drift separations ,",
    "however , the reconstructed @xmath57 values for the two tracks were found to be correlated .",
    "this is interpretted as due to an angular jitter of the laser and a simple model is used to describe this situation .",
    "the measured track parameter @xmath57 for track @xmath46 ( @xmath59 or 2 - the near or far track ) , is described as an outcome of a random variable @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a random variable of mean zero describing the jitter of the laser system and @xmath63 is a random variable of mean zero describing the random nature of the @xmath57 measurement by the tpc .",
    "the covariance , @xmath64 , isolates the contribution from the laser jitter , and its square root is found to be about 10  @xmath1 m , corresponding to an angular jitter of about 5  @xmath1rad .",
    "only data with two laser pulses are used , so that the laser jitter term can be removed , and the standard deviation of the remainder is multiplied by @xmath58 to form the direct single row resolution .",
    "the direct single row resolution is determined from fits with @xmath56 , in order that the correlation between @xmath57 and @xmath42 not influence the resolution measurement .",
    "this is compared to the esrr for the same data sets in fig .  [",
    "fig : lasercheck ] .",
    "the fits used in the esrr calculation allowed @xmath42 to float , as is done when estimating the resolution with the cosmic ray data .",
    "the esrr is found to be somewhat smaller than the direct resolution ; it appears that esrr @xmath65 direct .    in summary ,",
    "the simulation and laser studies show that the method used in this paper to estimate the single row resolution of a gem tpc appears to be correct within a systematic uncertainty of about 10% .",
