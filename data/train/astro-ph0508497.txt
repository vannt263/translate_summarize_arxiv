    "a generic prediction of cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory is the process of bottom up halo formation , where large halos form from the mergers of smaller halos , which are in turn formed from even smaller halos .",
    "this is a violent process and it violates most of the assumptions that go into the spherical top - hat collapse model of halo formation which is often used to describe halos . since mass accretion onto halos is often directional and tends to be clumpy , one would not expect halos to be spherical if the relaxation time of the halos were longer than the time between mergers and/or if the in - falling halos came along a preferential direction ( such as along a filament ) . in both theoretical modelling of cdm and observations ,",
    "halos are found to be very non - spherical .",
    "in fact , spherical halos are rare",
    ". therefore , the analysis of halo shapes can give us another clue to the nature of the dark matter and the process of halo and galaxy formation .",
    "one way of quantifying the shape of a halo is to go one step beyond the spherical approximation and approximate halos by ellipsoids .",
    "ellipsoids are characterised by three axes , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , which are normally described in terms of ratios , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "ellipsoids can also be described in terms of three classes , which have corresponding ratio ranges : prolate ( sausage shaped ) ellipsoids have @xmath19 leading to axial ratios of @xmath20 , oblate ( pancake shaped ) ellipsoids have @xmath21 leading to axial ratios of @xmath22 , and triaxial ellipsoids are in between prolate and oblate with @xmath23 . additionally , when talking about purely oblate ellipsoids , @xmath24 , it is common to use just @xmath25 , since @xmath6 and @xmath25 are degenerate .",
    "there have been many theoretical papers published over the years which examined the subject of halo shapes .",
    "the early work on the subject includes @xcite .",
    "all of these works agreed that halos are ellipsoidal , but otherwise differ in several details .",
    "@xcite found that halos have axial ratios of @xmath26 in the interior and become more spherical at larger radii , while @xcite found that halos are slightly more spherical in the centres .",
    "@xcite claimed that larger mass halos have a slight tendency to be more spherical , where more recent simulation results find the opposite . despite these disagreements many of the early authors give us clues into the nature of halos shapes . @xcite and @xcite showed that the angular momentum axis of a halo is well correlated with the smallest axis , @xmath27 , although , as most of these authors pointed out , halos are not rotationally supported .",
    "this therefore has led many to conclude that the shapes are supported by anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite took it one step further and found that the velocity anisotropy was in turn correlated with the infall anisotropy of merging satellites .",
    "most authors found that the axial ratios of halos are @xmath28 and that halos tend to be prolate as opposed to oblate in shape .",
    "the most likely source of the disagreement in these works and in the more recent works we describe below is the different methods used often coupled with inadequate resolution .",
    "more recent studies of halos shape were performed by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "the results of these authors differ , in some cases , considerably .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to carefully examine the differences in the findings presented by the above authors .",
    "all of the aforementioned publications ( except * ? ? ?",
    "* ) analyse simulations with either no baryons or with adiabatic hydrodynamics .",
    "this is both due to the cost associated with performing self consistent hydrodynamical simulations of large volumes with high mass resolution and due to the fact that very few cosmological simulations yet produce realistic galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , we know that the presence of baryons should have an effect on the shapes of halos due to their collisional behaviour .",
    "three recent papers have attempted to examine the effect of baryons @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the same simulations were done using no baryons , adiabatic baryons and baryons with cooling and star formation . in the first two cases",
    "there was very little difference , but with the presence of cooling and star formation the halos became more spherical .",
    "the radial dependence of shape also changes such that the halo is more spherical in the centre . at @xmath29 the axial ratio @xmath6 increases by @xmath30 , but in the interior the increase @xmath31 is as much as @xmath32 .",
    "in an independent study , @xcite found an even larger effect due to baryonic cooling in a set of 11 high resolution clusters . at @xmath33 the authors found that @xmath6 can increase by @xmath34 in the presence of gas cooling .",
    "the extent of the over - cooling problem plaguing these simulations is still uncertain .",
    "this amount of change in the shape should be viewed as an upper limit .",
    "the most recent work on the subject is @xcite , who concentrate more on the relative orientation of the galaxy formed at the centre of eight high resolution halos than on the relative sphericity of the halos . despite this , from figure 1 of @xcite",
    "it seems that they would also predict an increase of @xmath35 for @xmath6 .",
    "it is still useful to study shapes of halos without baryonic cooling .",
    "cooling and star formation in simulations is still a very open question , making the effect of the cooling uncertain .",
    "we show in paper ii that our simulations without cooling match shapes of x - ray clusters .",
    "measurements of the shapes of both cluster and galaxy mass halos through varied observational techniques are increasingly becoming available . there have been many studies of the x - ray morphologies of clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which can be directly related to the shape of the inner part of the cluster halo @xcite . for a review of x - ray cluster shapes and the latest results , see @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper ii .",
    "there has also been important new information on the shape of galaxy mass halos , in particular our own milky way halo .",
    "@xcite concluded that the host halo around the galactic disk is oblate with a short - to - long axial ratio of @xmath36 .",
    "investigations of sagittarius tidal streams have led to the conclusion that the milky way halo is oblate and nearly spherical with @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , by inspecting m giants within the leading stream @xcite and @xcite found a best fit prolate halo with @xmath38 . @xcite summarises the currently reliable observations for galaxy host halo shapes using multiple techniques and find that the observations vary a lot .",
    "another method for studying shapes of halos at higher redshift is galaxy - galaxy weak lensing studies . analysing data taken with the canada - france - hawaii telescope , @xcite find a signal at a @xmath39 confidence level for halo asphericity .",
    "they detect an average projected ellipticity of @xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41 , for halos with an average mass of @xmath42 .",
    "ongoing studies of galaxy - galaxy weak lensing promise rapidly improving statistics from large scale surveys like the canada - france legacy survey .",

    "we use these two simulations to study the effects of the spectrum normalisation , but to achieve better statistics and make predictions for @xmath90 at @xmath13 we also include another simulation of the same size and resolution ( l@xmath61 ) .",

    "first , all particles are assigned a density using the smooth algorithm , which uses a symmetric sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) smoothing kernel on the 32 nearest neighbours .",

    "are calculated in spherical bins .",
    "unbound particles are removed iteratively as described in @xcite .",
    "the halo catalogue used is complete for halos with @xmath102 particles .",
    "this corresponds to a mass below which the cumulative mass and velocity functions begin to flatten ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the halo density profiles are constructed using only bound particles and they are fit by an nfw profile @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the radius at which the log density profile has a slope of @xmath105 and the density is @xmath106 .",
    "one of the parameters , @xmath104 or @xmath107 , can be replaced by a virial parameter ( @xmath108,@xmath109 , or @xmath110 ) defined such that the mean density inside the virial radius is @xmath111 times the mean universal density @xmath112 at that redshift : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the critical density , and @xmath115 from @xcite with @xmath116 for the cosmology assumed here .",
    "the nfw density profile fitting is performed using a @xmath117 minimisation algorithm .",
    "the profiles are binned logarithmically from twice the resolution length ( see table [ tab : sim ] ) out to @xmath118 , the radius within which the average density is equal to 500 times the critical density of the universe .",

    "this reduction of bins is continued until both criteria are met .",
    "fits using this method have been compared to fits determined using different merit functions , such as the maximum deviation from the fit as described in @xcite and it was found that they give very similar results for individual halos . after fitting the halos",
    "the host halo and subhalo relationship is determined very simply . if a halo s centre is contained within the virial radius of a more massive halo , that halo is considered a subhalo of the larger halo .",
    "all halo properties reported here are for halos which are determined to be isolated or host halos ( i.e. , not subhalos ) .",
    "there are many different methods to determine shapes of halos .",
    "all methods model halos as ellipsoidal with the eigenvectors of some form of the inertia tensor corresponding to the axes @xmath120 ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) .",
    "the two forms of the inertia tensor used in the literature to determine shape are the unweighted , @xmath123 and the weighted ( or reduced ) , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the elliptical distance in the eigenvector coordinate system from the centre to the @xmath126th particle . in both cases the eigenvalues ( @xmath127 ) determine the axial ratios described at the beginning of section [ sec : intro ] with @xmath128 .",
    "the orientation of the halo is determined by the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "one would like to recover the shape of an isodensity surface .",

    "the simulations analysed here enable us to analyse halos spanning a mass range from galaxy to cluster sized objects .",
    "these data provide an opportunity to study the variation of shape and its intrinsic scatter with halo mass .",
    "various statistics are used to derive robust estimates of the dependence of shape on halo - centric radius . combining the detailed spatial and dynamical information from the simulations we can relate quantities like angular momentum or velocity anisotropy tensor to the shape and the orientation of the halo . in this section we aim to present a comprehensive analysis of the properties of halos at all redshifts . in section [ sec : merg ]",

    "our analysis of the halo shapes as a function of redshift leads to the following results . within fixed mass bins the redshift dependence of @xmath239",
    "is well characterised by the evolution of @xmath147 , unlike the findings of @xcite who predict a much steeper relation of @xmath296 at high redshifts .",
    "we find that equation ( [ eq : powerconc ] ) works well for different values of @xmath43 ( a variation of @xmath43 results in a variation of @xmath147 which appears as a normalisation parameter in the @xmath139 relation ) .",
    "also worth noting is that at higher redshift the possible broken power - law behaviour disappears , but if it were truly due to @xmath147 we would expect this , because already by @xmath163 @xmath147 is below our mass resolution .",
    "we find that the @xmath139 at @xmath148 for galaxy mass halos is @xmath297 with a dispersion of @xmath298 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with only one estimate for the axial ratio of the milky way ( mw ) halo .",
    "@xcite claims that a study of the m giants in the leading edge of the stream tidally stripped from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy leads to a best fit prolate halo with @xmath38 .",
    "after analysis of the same data , @xcite confirm this finding .",
    "other studies @xcite which examined different aspects of these streams concluded that the mw halo is oblate and nearly spherical with @xmath37 .",
    "if the shape of the mw halo is truly this spherical , it is either at least @xmath291 more spherical than the median , or else baryonic cooling has had a large effect on the shape of the dark matter halo ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "describing halo shapes by the triaxiality parameter @xmath207 introduced by @xcite , we find that the majority of halos are prolate with the fraction of halos being prolate increasing for halos with @xmath299 . since halo shapes are closely connected to their internal velocity structure , we compute the angular momentum and the velocity anisotropy tensor and relate them to both the orientation of the halo and the triaxiality . in agreement with previous studies",
    "we find that the angular momentum is highly correlated with the smallest axis of the halo and that the principal axes of the velocity anisotropy tensor tend to be highly aligned with the principal axes of the halo .",
    "the strong alignment of all three axes of the two tensors is remarkable since the velocity tensor tends to be more spherical , thus the determination of its axes might be degenerate which would disturb the correlation with the spatial axes .",
    "if the accretion of matter determines the velocity tensor the tight correlation between velocity tensor and density shape argues for a determination of the halo shape by merging processes .",
    "finally we examine the evolution of shapes by following the merger trees of the individual halos .",
    "we find that the different mass accretion histories of halos can not fully explain the observed dispersion about the mean @xmath6 within fixed mass bins .",
    "it is likely that an analysis of the three dimensional accretion is essential for the explanation of the dispersion at a fixed value of mass and @xmath12 .",
    "however , halos with earlier formation times ( lower @xmath12 ) tend to be more spherical at @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , there is a pattern of halos becoming spherical at a more rapid rate for halos that formed earlier and this rate appears to be independent of the final mass .",
    "the evolution of the shape for @xmath300 is well described by @xmath301 where @xmath302 .",
    "we detect a definite trend for the transformation from highly aspherical to more spherical halo shapes after @xmath12 .",
    "the change of @xmath6 seems to be less dependent on the total halo mass but strongly influenced by the relative mass increase since @xmath12 which suggests that halos are becoming more spherical with time due to a change in the accretion pattern after @xmath12 from a directional to a more spherical mode .",

    "= 3.8 in        a potential source of systematic error in the determination of halo shapes is the limited number of particles involved for low mass halos . in figure",
    "[ fig : modelcomp ] we show the result of a monte carlo ( mc ) test .",
    "our dark matter halos are adequately described by an elliptical nfw density profile independently of cosmological model . therefore ,",
    "in the figure we show the result of applying the reduced tensor method of equation ( [ eq : inertia2 ] ) to mc halos built to have an ellipsoidal nfw profile . the axial ratios of the mc halos are drawn from gaussian distributions of mean @xmath303 and @xmath304 , and dispersion @xmath305 .",
    "approximately @xmath306 halos were generated , each having @xmath307 particles , in order to have a catalogue comparable to the sample of halos in the l@xmath89 box with mass in the range @xmath308 .",
    "the scatter plot shows that individual values of @xmath6 determined at @xmath7 which contains roughly 300 of the 1000 particles in the halo .",
    "the recovered shape can be in error by up to @xmath309 .",
    "however , the scatter and mean of the distribution are very well determined by the inertia tensor method .",
    "the inset shows the histogram for the input values of the mc halos ( solid line ) , and the histogram for the output values ( i.e. determined by the tensor method ; dotted line ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the tensor method underestimates @xmath6 by only @xmath310 for halos of this mass . for halos of mass @xmath311 , the error falls to @xmath312 .",
    "the one problem with the above test is that we are attempting to recover shapes from smooth halos . in reality halos",
    "have substructure and the substructure must play a role in the shape of the halo .",
    "the presence of dense lumps close to the core will bias @xmath154 to lower values relative to values determined from isodensity shells . in order to test our ability to recover the axial ratios in a cosmological simulation we determine the mean shape of halos down to very low masses for all of our simulations and then compare them to one another .",
    "the main difference between this test and the previous one is that the halos in the cosmological simulations contain substructure , but we do not know a priori what the distribution of shapes should be . in figure",
    "[ fig : resolution ] we have plotted the shapes of halos down to very low particle numbers . there appear to be two resolution effects at work here .",
    "the first effect is an extension of the result we found in the mc test above . at small particle number",
    "the recovered shape becomes very aspherical and all of the simulations turn over at the same number of particles . for all of the simulations",
    "the turnover is detected at @xmath313 particles within @xmath314 ( which is @xmath315 particles within @xmath7 , where we are determining the shape ) .",
    "this is consistent with our mc tests . at higher particle numbers there seems to be another effect driven by the particle number and not the mass .",
    "halos containing @xmath316 particles for any given simulation show a trend of becoming more spherical on average than the simulations of higher resolution for the same mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp120 ] we show the determined value for @xmath6 for the most massive halos shared by the l@xmath71 simulation and the resimulated subregion , l@xmath75 .",
    "we find that halos shapes between the two simulations can differ by as much as @xmath317 in @xmath6 .",
    "this is not unexpected because in the resimulation process the identical halos are captured at slightly different times .",
    "the main point here is that the average value of @xmath6 is lower in the higher resolution simulation for the same halos by @xmath318 .",
