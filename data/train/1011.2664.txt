    "in many physically interesting situations direct monte - carlo sampling of the path integral of the theory is not an efficient simulation method .",
    "probably the most notable example in hadronic physics is qcd at finite chemical potential .",
    "another example are quantum field theories in the large-@xmath0 limit , since the computational complexity of monte - carlo algorithms tends to infinity in this limit , and one always has to rely on extrapolations from finite @xmath0",
    ".    one of the ways to overcome these difficulties is to expand the desired path integral in powers of some coupling constants , and to sum up the obtained series stochastically .",
    "this is the basic idea of the diagrammatic monte - carlo @xcite .",
    "this method , however , can not be straightforwardly applied to field theories with continuous variables , since in such cases the perturbative series are typically only asymptotic @xcite .",
    "for field theories with a non - abelian internal symmetry group , such as @xmath1 , each diagram contains also some power of @xmath0 , and the sums over the terms leading in @xmath0 are typically convergent @xcite .",
    "this salient feature of large-@xmath0 quantum field theories was used in @xcite to construct a stochastic algorithm for summing over all planar diagrams in perturbative expansions .",
    "this algorithm is based on the stochastic solution of the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations in the factorized form , so that they are interpreted as the equations for the stationary probability distribution of a certain random process .",
    "the correlators of the field variables are thus estimated as probability distributions of some random variables , similarly to the `` worm algorithm '' @xcite .",
    "once the sd equations can be cast in the stochastic form @xmath2 where @xmath3 schematically denote the field correlators and the coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfy the inequality @xmath7 , one can construct a `` nonlinear '' random process for which @xmath3 is the stationary probability distribution @xcite .    however , when the field variables are the elements of @xmath1 , sd equations can be rewritten as ( [ random_process_eq ] ) only in the strong coupling limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the continuum limit of such theories typically corresponds to the weak - coupling limit . in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest nontrivial model defined by the integral over @xmath1 group in the limit @xmath8 , namely , the gross - witten unitary matrix model @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the method of @xcite can be used to simulate this model in both the strong- and the weak - coupling regimes . in the latter case",
    ", one has to change the variables to the noncompact ones , which are more adequate for the weak - coupling expansion .",
    "the partition function of the gross - witten model @xcite is @xmath9 and the observables of interest are @xmath10 .",
    "the sd equations for the model ( [ gw_pf ] ) in terms of the observables @xmath11 are : @xmath12 by a variable redefinition @xmath13 one can transform these equations into the stochastic form ( [ random_process_eq ] ) if @xmath14 . according to @xcite ,",
    "such equations describe the stationary distribution of the random process operating on the stack of the elements of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an integer labeling the observables @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is proportional to the difference of the probabilities to find the elements @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the top of the stack . at each step of",
    "the random process one performs at random one of the following steps :    create : :    : with probability    @xmath21 push a new    element @xmath22 to the stack .",
    "join : :    : with probability @xmath23 pop the two elements    @xmath24 and    @xmath25 and push a new element    @xmath26 .",
    "increase : :    : with probability @xmath27    increase the topmost element in the stack by one .",
    "decrease : :    : with probability @xmath28 decrease the topmost    element in the stack by one and change its sign .",
    "restart : :    : otherwise restart with a stack containing a single element    @xmath22 .    the dependence of the observables @xmath11 on @xmath29 is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : gw_sc_seq ] .",
    "the data were obtained for @xmath30 iterations of the random process , which took several seconds on a standard 2 ghz cpu . in agreement with the exact solution @xcite , only @xmath31 is nonzero and behaves as @xmath32 , while all other observables are equal to zero within error range . it should be noted that the element @xmath15 with @xmath33 are generated by our random process , but their contributions to @xmath17 at @xmath33 cancel on average , and as a result @xmath34 for @xmath33 .",
    "a similar stochastic strong - coupling solution can be easily constructed for other models with @xmath1 field variables , for example , for the large-@xmath0 @xmath1 non - abelian lattice gauge theory . in this case",
    "the desired random process will be a minor modification of the stochastic solution of the weingarten model @xcite .",
    "however , such a strong - coupling solution is not very interesting , since the continuum physics should emerge in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "at sufficiently small @xmath29 the equations ( [ gw_sd_eq ] ) can not be transformed to the stochastic form by a simple rescaling of observables . in order to obtain a perturbative solution in this case ,",
    "let us introduce the new hermitian matrix variables @xmath35 via the relation @xmath36 , where the value of @xmath37 will be given later .",
    "first we have to express the haar measure on @xmath1 in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "it can be found from the invariant metric form @xmath38 : @xmath39 now one can include the haar measure ( [ un_inv_metric ] ) into the action for the variables @xmath35 and express integrals over @xmath40 as integrals over @xmath35 .",
    "the new action can be expanded in powers of @xmath35 , thus leading to the hermitian matrix model with an infinite number of terms in the potential : @xmath41 now we set @xmath42 so that the quadratic term in the action ( [ newvar_action ] ) becomes @xmath43 .",
    "it is interesting that another parameterizations of @xmath1 group manifold by hermitian matrices ( e.g. the exponential @xmath44 ) can in general lead to multi - trace terms in the action .",
    "the sd equations for the new action ( [ newvar_action ] ) involve the observables @xmath45 .",
    "again , we rescale the variables as @xmath46 to cast the sd equation in the stochastic form ( [ random_process_eq ] ) : @xmath47 following @xcite , one can devise a random process which samples the unknowns @xmath18 .",
    "the configuration space of the process is again the stack containing positive integers which label the observables @xmath48 and signs . at each time step one",
    "performs at random one of the following actions :    create : :    : with probability @xmath49    push a new element @xmath22 to the    stack .",
    "join : :    : with probability @xmath23 pop the two elements    @xmath24 and    @xmath25 and push a new element    @xmath50 .",
    "increase : :    : with probability @xmath51 increase the topmost element in    the stack by one .",
    "decrease : :    : with probability    @xmath52    decrease the topmost element @xmath15    in the stack by @xmath53 and change its sign if    @xmath54 is even .",
    "restart : :    : otherwise restart with a stack containing a single element    @xmath22 .      in order to calculate the observables @xmath17",
    ", one should expand them in powers of @xmath35 : @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 can be then found from the averages @xmath58 w.r.t .",
    "the above described random process . here",
    "@xmath54 is the topmost element in the stack and @xmath59 is the corresponding sign .",
    "the observables @xmath11 are compared with the exact solution @xcite on fig .",
    "[ fig : gw_wc_seq ] for @xmath60 and for @xmath61 . in order to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm , on fig .",
    "[ fig : gw_wc_pt ] we plot the contributions of different @xmath54 ( positive and negative separately ) to @xmath62 at @xmath60 .",
    "solid lines are the exact values @xmath11 .",
    "it should be noted that since @xmath63 , each such contribution corresponds to the term of order @xmath64 in the weak - coupling expansion of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath31 is saturated almost completely by the lowest - order term , while for @xmath65 large contributions of different @xmath54 cancel to yield a numerically small value .",
    "contributions of negative @xmath54 are numerically small in both cases .",
    "thus the strength of the `` sign problem '' for our random process actually depends on the choice of observables .",
    "we also note that no critical slowing down near @xmath66 was observed neither in the weak- nor in the strong - coupling phases .",
