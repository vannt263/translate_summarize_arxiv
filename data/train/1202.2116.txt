    "* ) and adopted in many applications ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations of resolved stellar populations and integrated colors of most galaxies are consistent with a universal imf , but a non - universal imf has been inferred recently , possibly depending on environmental parameters @xcite",
    ". the imf could be steeper ( or truncated ) , as compared to the standard one , in low density environments , such as dwarfs and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , thus producing fewer high - mass stars @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a top heavy imf is suggested in dense starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite explained the apparent non - universality as a purely statistical effect ; the intrinsic imf shape is invariant , but the maximum mass of the stars in a stellar cluster is limited by the mass of the parental cluster , the mass of which is in turn controlled by star formation activity .",
    "thereby , the imf integrated over a galaxy  integrated galactic imf ( igimf ) , may apparently differ in low density environments .",
    "@xcite suggested another model : a low gas density could result in fragmentation into gas clumps too small to allow high - mass star formation .",
    "the non - universality of the imf potentially alters our understanding of star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "its confirmation is urgent .",
    "the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) provides a means to investigate the high - mass end of the imf .",
    "the combination of galex and @xmath0 data can separate the populations of o and b stars ; the two galex bands , fuv ( 1539@xmath5 ) and nuv ( 2316@xmath5 ) , are sensitive to both stellar clusters with o stars and with b stars , while @xmath0 data are responsive predominantly to clusters with o stars .",
    "@xcite analyzed the @xmath0 to fuv flux ratio over galaxies , found a deficit of ionizing o stars , and concluded that the imf is steeper ( or truncated ) in dwarfs and lsbs .",
    "this analysis , however , is sensitive to the procedure of dust extinction correction ( see alternative analysis ; * ? ? ?",
    "another approach , the comparison of @xmath0 flux with cluster mass , points to a universal imf @xcite .",

    "star formation in such low density outskirts is a prime target to study the imf variation .",
    "in fact , the radial uv profile extends beyond the @xmath0 truncation radius @xcite , indicating that o stars are extremely rare while b stars are abundant .",
    "the absence may be an indication of a non - universal imf , or could simply be the effect of mixed stellar ages @xcite  as o stars are the primary sources of hii regions and have much shorter lives ( @xmath6 6 myr ) than b stars ( @xmath6 100 myr ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite averaged @xmath0 and fuv fluxes over xuv disks and found the ratio consistent with the prediction from the standard imf , although the sensitivity and area coverage of their @xmath0 data were limited .",

    "note that a factor of 10 increase in cluster mass shifts all the magnitude curves in figure [ fig : model ] ( top ) systematically upward by 2.5 magnitudes , but it does not change the color curves . for these models , we assume the salpeter imf with a lower cut - off mass of @xmath25 .",
    "the upper cut - off mass is set to @xmath26 100 , 20 , and 3 @xmath27 , which corresponds to the masses of the most massive o , b , and a - type stars , respectively @xcite .",
    "in other words , the last two models represent the truncated imf ( or , almost equivalently , the steeper imf ) without o or ob stars .",
    "we adopt 20% of the solar metallicity ( @xmath28 ) from the spectroscopic measurements @xcite . for a reference , the spectra of individual o , b and",
    "a stars are discussed in appendix [ sec : starspec ] .",
    "there are quantitative differences between clusters with and without ob stars , i.e. , between the standard and truncated ( steeper ) imfs .",
    "clusters without ob stars are fainter by 6 mag in fuv for the first 10 myr and never become as blue as fuv - nuv@xmath290.2@xmath300.3 mag . therefore , blue clusters ( @xmath290.2@xmath300.3 mag ) must have o and/or b stars .",
    "the fuv - nuv color is insensitive to the difference between clusters with only b stars ( up to @xmath31 ) and with both o and b stars ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is primarily because the galex bands trace only the rayleigh - jeans side of stellar thermal radiation for both o and early - type b stars ( appendix [ sec : starspec ] ) .",
    "the fuv - nuv color is therefore a useful indicator of the presence of o and/or b stars in a cluster .",
    "the @xmath33 color differentiates clusters with o stars from those without them , since o stars emit a significantly greater number of ionizing photons than b stars @xcite .",

    ", the numbers of blue clusters in fuv - nuv and @xmath33 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) should be proportional to the durations that clusters are blue ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) .",

    "the assumption of a constant cluster formation rate should be approximately accurate when integrated over the large xuv disk and over a short timescale , i.e. , the young ages of clusters which can be detected with our color selection criteria ( below ) . in fact , the clusters that we count in  [ sec : uniimf ] are distributed over the uv disk ( figure [ fig : coverage ] ) .    for the standard imf ( @xmath44 and @xmath28 ) ,",

    ", they should appear occasionally even in small clusters under the stochastic imf , though they tend not to appear in a small sample due to their low probability of formation in small clusters .",
    "such a stochastic effect becomes particularly apparent when the cluster mass is small ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "our subaru observations detect small clusters ( down to @xmath74 ) and confirm that even those small clusters show @xmath0 excess ( i.e. , @xmath79 mag ) ; and some even have @xmath47 mag , a color which only o stars can produce . thus ,",

    "the @xmath33 color is sensitive to the mass of the most massive star in a cluster when the cluster is young , whereas fuv - nuv does not distinguish o stars from b stars well (  [ sec : model ] ; figure [ fig : model ] ; see also appendix [ sec : starspec ] ) .",
    "if a cluster has no massive star , it should appear redder ( @xmath95 -1 mag ; figure [ fig : model ] ) than the observed clusters in the range @xmath96 ; yet some clusters appear in the range @xmath97 -1@xmath6 -2 mag .",
    "massive o stars in small clusters should be populated stochastically .",

    "this prefers the stochastic imf , as even the less massive clusters have o stars .",
    "the discussion so far is about clusters of stars .",

    "consistent sample selection between galex and subaru data is crucial in this analysis .",

    "clusters with o stars show @xmath56 mag for only 5.8 myr .",
    "the model therefore predicts @xmath107 .",
    "the number of blue clusters with fuv - nuv @xmath29 0 mag is counted using figure [ fig : fuvhist ] ( red )  after the internal extinction correction , it is @xmath108 . from figure",
    "[ fig : colormag ] , @xmath109 for @xmath56 mag ( see figure [ fig : pstamps ] ) .",
    "the errors are based on the poisson distribution , and the counts are made after the internal extinction correction .",
    "therefore , the observed ratio is @xmath110 .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of the standard imf ( within a 1@xmath68 deviation ) .",
    "the counts of stellar clusters support the standard imf with a simple aging effect .",
    "it is worth noting that the slight deviation does not likely have a statistical significance .",
    "however , if anything , it is inclined toward the top - heavy imf side , as opposed to the previous suggestion of a truncated imf .",
    "the combination of the parameters we adopt [ i.e. , low metallicity ( @xmath28 ) , smc extinction , and @xmath65 mag ] is the best to consistently explain the new data , model , and previous spectroscopic studies .",
    "the result for the standard imf does not change even if a higher metallicity ( @xmath111 ) , and hence the lmc extinction curve , is adopted . if we ignore the spectroscopic studies , the comparison of the data and model ( e.g. , figure [ fig : colorcolor ] ) provides @xmath112 mag . with this extinction ,",
    "we count @xmath113 and @xmath114 and obtain @xmath115 .",
    "the model ratio is 0.10 with the metallicity @xmath116 , where @xmath117 myr and @xmath118 myr .",
    "therefore , the observations and model are consistent even if a different metallicity and extinction are assumed .",
    "the @xmath0-to - fuv flux ratio ( @xmath119 ) over the entire xuv disk is another measure of the high - mass end of the imf .",
    "we find that the observed ratio is consistent with the one predicted from the standard imf .",
    "a lower ratio may suggest a truncated imf @xcite , though an extinction correction introduces an ambiguity @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the ratio more accurately since we derived the extinction of @xmath65 mag statistically (  [ sec : intext2 ] ) .    in a starburst99 simulation with a constant star formation rate , a metallicity of @xmath28 , and the salpeter imf with ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) = ( 0.1 , 100)@xmath27",
    ", the ratio approaches an approximate constant and is , e.g. , @xmath122 in unit of @xmath123 after 1 gyr assuming a star formation rate of @xmath124 ( though the constant does not depend on these values ) .",
    "@xcite calculate the ratio with their own model using the kroupa imf and derive @xmath125 ( from their figure 1 ) .",
    "the scatter between the models is about 30% .",
    "compared to these values , the observed ratios previously reported in lsb galaxies by @xcite  as low as one third of the values calculated in these models  deviate at a significant level with respect to the model uncertainties .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 to fuv flux ratio over the xuv disk of m83 by summing up the fluxes of all @xmath126 detections in the fuv image (  [ sec : fuvsel ] ) .",
    "assuming that out objects represent the background population (  [ sec : background ] ) and subtracting their total fluxes form those of in objects ( accounting for the in / out area ratio ) , we obtain @xmath127 and @xmath128 . adopting @xmath65 mag and the smc extinction curve (  [ sec : extcor ] ) ,",
    "the intrinsic ratio after the extinction correction is @xmath129 .",
    "this value is only @xmath130 lower than our model prediction , and not as much as what the previous study found @xcite . as the difference between this value and our model calculation is similar to the scatter between the models , we consider a truncated imf to be unwarranted in the case of m83 .",
    "using new deep subaru @xmath0 data and archival galex data of the extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) disk of m83 , we show that the standard salpeter imf explains the number counts of stellar clusters in the low density , low metallicity environment . even in clusters with small mass ( @xmath1 ) o stars are populated , at least occasionally , suggesting that the stochastic imf is preferable to the truncated imf .",
    "the @xmath0 to fuv flux ratio over the xuv disk also supports the standard imf .",
    "the analyses were guided by the stellar population synthesis model starburst99 .",
    "the new data , together with the population synthesis model and previous spectroscopic studies , provide overall very consistent results at the metallicity ( @xmath4 ) , internal extinction ( @xmath3 mag ) , and colors of the stellar clusters in the xuv disk .",
    "we counted the numbers of fuv - bright clusters ( which should have o and/or b stars ) and @xmath0-bright clusters ( having o stars ) , whose ratio constrains the high - mass end of the imf .",
    "the ratio of number counts can be translated to the ratio of their lifetimes with starburst99 , under the two assumptions of instantaneous cluster formation and a constant cluster formation rate in the xuv disk . as a result , the number counts are consistent with the standard imf and a simple aging effect .",
    "this study benefits from the combination of the unparalleled wide field - of - view and sensitivity of suprime - cam .",
    "the new image covers an area far beyond the detection limit of the hi gas ( thus , beyond the boundary of the xuv disk ) , enabling us to remove the background contaminations statistically , which had been a difficulty in previous studies .",
    "we found that virtually all blue clusters ( fuv - nuv@xmath131 0.0 mag after the extinction correction ; or @xmath131 0.16 mag before the correction ) are within the hi gas .",

    "we consider the threshold mass of a stellar cluster where the incomplete sampling ( filling ) of the imf ( i.e. , stochastic effect ) becomes important .",
    "it depends on the definition of `` stochastic sampling '' , because in reality an o star with the highest mass @xmath132 is rarely found ( at least in the milky way ) , and even a massive cluster ( e.g. , @xmath133 ) may not host any star with @xmath32 in a statistical sense . on the contrary , we could define the fully - sampled imf as the one in which at least one o star of any subclass ( @xmath93 ) is populated .",
    "of course , a cluster is more likely to host a @xmath134 star than a @xmath32 star , and the threshold mass should be lower in the former case .",
    "one could also take a different approach ; for example , @xcite found @xmath80 as the threshold mass where the @xmath0 luminosity over cluster mass starts to deviate from a constant .    here",
    ", we take a simpler approach to illustrate a range of threshold cluster mass that may provide an important guideline .",
    "the threshold mass necessary to populate the imf to some upper mass cutoff depends on that maximum stellar mass    the stellar initial mass function ( @xmath135 ) with the upper and lower stellar mass cuts ( @xmath73 and @xmath72 , respectively ) is normalized as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the total mass of a stellar cluster . assuming a power - law imf ( @xmath138 ) the normalization coefficient ( @xmath139 ) is @xmath140 if we sum up the masses of all stars with masses greater than a threshold stellar mass @xmath141 , the sum is @xmath142 in order to populate at least one star as massive as @xmath141 , this sum should be greater than @xmath141 [ i.e. , @xmath143 ; and therefore , @xmath144 in the case of a power - law imf .",
    "this condition is necessary to _ unstochastically _ populate the imf up to @xmath141 in the cluster , providing a threshold cluster mass to have a star up to mass @xmath141 .",
    "a similar calculation also provides a guideline of the maximum stellar mass that a cluster with @xmath137 is likely to host  the imf would be filled up to @xmath141 if it is populated smoothly from the lowest stellar mass @xmath72 toward the highest until the total mass reaches the cluster mass @xmath137 .",
    "thus , the maximum stellar mass in the cluster is around @xmath141 .",
    "figure [ fig : mcl ] shows the threshold cluster mass @xmath137 as a function of the maximum stellar mass @xmath141 that should be populated .",
    "we assumed the salpeter imf ( @xmath145 ) , @xmath25 , and @xmath44 .",
    "in order to have a @xmath91 star the cluster mass should be at minimum @xmath78 , while to have @xmath146 it needs to be @xmath71 .",
    "all stars with @xmath93 are classified as o - type stars ; and to have at least one o star the cluster mass should be greater than @xmath147 . to fill the imf literally up to @xmath148 , the cluster mass should be on the order of @xmath149 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath150 ( arbitrarily ) as a typical mass of o stars , the cluster mass should be @xmath151 to fully populate the imf up to this typical o star mass and avoid the stochastic effect .",
    "these threshold cluster masses are meaningful only in a statistical sense .",
    "a stochastic effect could appear even above this threshold mass if a monte - carlo simulation is performed .",
    "even if a cluster mass is above the threshold and the cluster _ can _ host a star with @xmath141 , this mass could be split and allocated to multiple stars with smaller masses ( whose total is @xmath141 ) . on the other hand",
    ", a cluster with mass below the threshold could occasionally have a star with mass @xmath152 at the expense of many less massive stars .",
    "the threshold cluster mass should be taken as a minimum mass to avoid the stochastic effect , only in a statistical sense . despite this limitation ,",
    "our estimate provides a crude guideline for discussion of the stochastic sampling of the imf .",

    "we choose the models whose parameter sets are the closest to the stellar parameters presented in @xcite or @xcite : ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 ) = ( 50000 k , 5.0 , 13.2 @xmath158 ) , ( 30000 , 4.0 , 7.4 ) , and ( 10000 , 4.0 , 2.4 ) for o3 , b0 , and a0 , respectively . we note that the spectra of high - mass stars are not calibrated very well as only few of those exist in the solar neighborhood for calibration . in addition , an adjustment of the parameters is necessary to fit observed spectra of individual stars @xcite .",
    "the spectra that we present here are only a reference to understand our observations .",
    "the continuum slopes are more or less the same between the o and b stars in the wavelength range of galex bands . on the other hand",
    ", the a star spectrum is rising from fuv to nuv . the fuv absolute magnitude ( ab ) and",
    "fuv - nuv color of the individual stars for three metallicity [ fe / h]=+0.0 ( @xmath159 ) , -0.5 ( @xmath160 ) , -1.0 ( @xmath161 ) are in table [ tab : uvstar ] .",
