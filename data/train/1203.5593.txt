    "according to recent observational data sets@xcite , our current universe is flat and undergoing a phase of the accelerated expansion which started about five billion years ago . in principle",
    ", this phenomenon can be explained by either dark energy ( see , for instance , ref.@xcite for reviews ) , in which the reason of this phenomenon is due to an exotic component with large negative pressure , or modified theories of gravity@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , up to now a satisfactory answer to the question that what dark energy is and where it came from has not yet to be obtained .",
    "alternative to dark energy , modified theories of gravity is extremely attractive , such as f(r ) gravity ( see , for instance , ref.@xcite for reviews ) , here f(r ) is an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar r. cosmic acceleration can be explained by f(r ) gravity@xcite , and the conditions of viable cosmological models have been derived in @xcite .",
    "a general model of @xmath1 gravity has been proposed in ref.@xcite , which contains a non - minimal coupling between geometry and matter .",
    "this coupling term can be considered as a gravitational source to explain the current acceleration of the universe . as a result of",
    "the coupling the motion of the massive particles is non - geodesic , and an extra force , orthogonal to the four - velocity , arises .",
    "different forms for the matter lagrangian density @xmath2 , and the resulting extra - force , were considered in @xcite , and it was shown that more natural forms for @xmath2 do not imply the vanishing of the extra - force .",
    "the implications of the non - minimal coupling on the stellar equilibrium were investigated in @xcite , where constraints on the coupling were also obtained . an inequality which expresses a necessary and sufficient condition to avoid the dolgov - kawasaki instability for the model",
    "was derived in @xcite . however , a more general model , in which the coupling style is arbitrary and the lagrangian density of matter only appears in coupling term , has been proposed in ref.@xcite , i.e. , the so - called the generalized f(r ) gravity with arbitrary coupling between matter and geometry . in this class of models",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the matter is generally not conserved , and the matter - geometry coupling can induce a supplementary acceleration of the test particles . moreover , the energy conditions and the dolgov - kawasaki criterion for the model have been derived in ref.@xcite , which are quite general and can degenerate to the well - known energy conditions in gr and f(r ) gravity with non - minimal coupling and non - coupling as special cases .",
    "another interesting alternative modified theory of gravity is the modified gauss - bonnet gravity , i.e. , f(g ) gravity , where f(g ) is a general function of the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term@xcite . at present specific models of f(g ) gravity have been proposed to account for the late - time cosmic acceleration@xcite , and the respective constraints on the parameters of the models have also analyzed in ref.@xcite . for more general forms of f(g ) ,",
    "the most crucial condition to be satisfied is @xmath3 , which is required to ensure the stability of a late - time de sitter solution as well as the existence of standard radiation / matter dominated epochs@xcite , and solar system constraints on f(g ) gravity models have been studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "recently the energy conditions in f(g ) gravity have been also discussed@xcite , but they are only adapted to @xmath4 gravity without coupling between matter and geometry . hence , in this paper the @xmath4 gravity models with curvature - matter coupling will be proposed , and some relevant issues , such as the energy conditions , the stability criterion and the conditions for late - time cosmic accelerated expansion , will be studied .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the @xmath4 gravity models with curvature - matter coupling are proposed , which is here called the modified @xmath4 gravity . and some fundamental elements of the modified @xmath4 gravity are given . in section 3 ,",
    "the well - known energy conditions , namely , the strong energy condition ( sec ) , the null energy condition ( nec ) , the weak energy condition ( wec ) and the dominant energy condition ( dec ) , will be derived .",
    "concretely , the two models are applied to the weak energy condition in order to understand the meaning of these energy conditions .",
    "furthermore , we will study stability criterion at the de sitter point , by which the parameters in the specific model in the modified f(g ) gravity can be constrained in section 4 .",
    "in addition , by using the conditions of power - law accelerated expansion and the equation of state of matter less than @xmath0 , the conditions for late - time cosmic accelerated expansion in the modified f(g ) gravity are discussed in section 5 .",
    "conclusions and discussions on our work are given in the last section .",
    "as we know , the modified einstein - hilbert action@xcite is , @xmath5,\\ ] ] in which @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath2 is the lagrangian density of matter .",
    "the gauss - bonnet invariant is defined as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ricci tensor and the riemann tensor , respectively ) .",
    "below , we consider f(g ) gravity with curvature - matter coupling , which is here called the modified f(g ) gravity .",
    "the lagrangian density of matter only appears in coupling term and the action is given by @xmath12l_m\\},\\ ] ] where we have chosen @xmath13 , which will be adopted hereafter .",
    "varying the action ( [ 2 ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath14 yields the field equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter , which is defined as : @xmath18    by assuming that the lagrangian density @xmath2 of the matter depends only on the metric tensor components , and not on its derivatives , we obtain @xmath19 . by taking the covariant derivative of eq.([3 ] ) , with the use of the bianchi identities , @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 is the einstein tensor ) , we can obtain the following relation : @xmath22 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] from which we see that the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of matter is violated due to the coupling between matter and geometry .    for the perfect fluid ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the four - velocity , and satisfies the conditions @xmath25 and @xmath26@xcite .",
    "thus , the covariant derivative of eq.([6 ] ) can be given as @xmath27 by imposing the condition of the conservation of the matter current , @xmath28 , and with the use of the identity @xmath29@xcite , we have the equation of motion of a test particle in the model as @xmath30 where the extra - force @xmath31 has the following expression @xmath32.\\ ] ] by substituting the relation ( [ 5 ] ) into eq.([9 ] ) , we can point that due to the presence of the coupling between matter and geometry , the motion of the massive particles is non - geodesic , and the extra - force @xmath31 is not orthogonal to the four - velocity @xmath24 , that is , there exists an angle between the extra - force @xmath31 and the four - velocity @xmath24 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the energy conditions arise when one refers to the raychaudhuri equation for the expansion@xcite . under these energy conditions",
    ", one allows not only to establish gravity which remains attractive , but also to keep the demands that the energy density is positive and can not flow faster than light .",
    "below , following ref.@xcite we simply review the raychaudhuri equation which is the physical origin of the null energy condition(nec ) and the strong energy condition(sec)@xcite .    in the case of a congruence of timelike geodesics defined by the vector field @xmath34 , the raychaudhuri equation is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the ricci tensor , the expansion parameter , the shear and the rotation associated with the congruence , respectively .",
    "while in the case of a congruence of null geodesics defined by the vector field @xmath38 , the raychaudhuri equation is given by @xmath39    from above expressions , it is clear that the raychaudhuri equation is a purely geometric statement and independent of the gravity theory . in order to constrain the energy - momentum tensor by the raychaudhuri equation , one can use the ricci tensor from the field equations of gravity to make a connection .",
    "namely , through the combination of the field equations of gravity and the raychaudhuri equation , one can obtain physical conditions for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "since @xmath40 ( the shear is a spatial tensor ) and @xmath41 ( hypersurface orthogonal congruence ) , from eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) , the conditions for gravity to remain attractive ( @xmath42 ) are @xmath43 @xmath44    thus by means of the relationship ( [ 12 ] ) and einstein s equation ( @xmath45 ) , one obtains @xmath46 if one considers a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath47 and pressure p , @xmath48 the relationship ( [ 14 ] ) turns into the well - known sec in general relativity , i.e. , @xmath49 similarly , by using the relationship ( [ 13 ] ) and einstein s equation , one has @xmath50 thus , by considering eq.([15 ] ) , the familiar nec in general relativity can be reproduced as : @xmath51      the einstein tensor resulting from the field equation ( [ 3 ] ) can be written @xmath52 where @xmath53 contracting the above equation , we have @xmath54 thus , we can write @xmath10 in terms of an effective stress - energy tensor and its trace , i.e. , @xmath55 by using the relationship ( [ 12 ] ) and eq.([22 ] ) , the sec can be given as : @xmath56 by using the eqs.([20 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , the sec in eq.([23 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the nec in the modified f(g ) gravity can be expressed as : @xmath59 by the same method as the sec , the nec in eq.([25 ] ) can be changed into @xmath60 furthermore , by means of eqs.([20 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) , the effective energy density and the effective pressure can be derived as follows : @xmath61 @xmath62    note that the above expressions of the sec ( [ 24 ] ) and the nec ( [ 26 ] ) are directly derived from raychaudhuri equation . however , equivalent results can obtained by the transformations @xmath63 and @xmath64 into @xmath65 and @xmath66 . thus by extending this approach to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the corresponding dec and the wec in the modified f(g ) gravity can be respectively given as : @xmath69 @xmath70 it is worth stressing that when taking @xmath71 , the energy conditions in general relativity can be reproduced .",

    "<S> a modified f(g ) gravity model with coupling between matter and geometry is proposed , which is described by the product of the lagrange density of the matter and an arbitrary function of the gauss - bonnet term . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations and the equations of motion corresponding to this model show the non - conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , the presence of an extra - force acting on test particles and the non - geodesic motion . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the energy conditions and the stability criterion at de sitter point in the modified f(g ) gravity models with curvature - matter coupling are derived , which can degenerate to the well - known energy conditions in general relativity . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> in order to get some insight on the meaning of these energy conditions , we apply them to the specific models of f(g ) gravity and the corresponding constraints on the models are given . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the conditions and the candidate for late - time cosmic accelerated expansion in the modified f(g ) gravity are studied by means of conditions of power - law expansion and the equation of state of matter less than @xmath0 . </S>"
