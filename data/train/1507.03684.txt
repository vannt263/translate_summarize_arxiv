    "logic is traditionally studied from the different viewpoints of syntax and semantics . from the syntactic viewpoint",
    ", formal proofs are investigated using proof systems such as natural deduction and sequent calculus . from the semantic viewpoint , set - theoretical models of sentences are usually investigated .",
    "in contrast to a proof , which shows the validity of a given inference , we usually disprove an inference by constructing a counter - model .",
    "a counter - model is one in which all premises of a given inference are true , but its conclusion is false . the notions of proofs and models are traditionally defined in the fundamentally different frameworks of syntax and semantics , respectively , and the completeness theorem , one of the most basic theorems of logic , provides a bridge between them . in university courses , logic is usually taught along such lines .    as the notion of a proof appears naturally in mathematics courses ,",
    "students are , to some extent , familiar with it . however , the notion of a model can be difficult for beginners .",
    "a set - theoretical model consists of a domain of entities and sets , and an interpretation function that assigns truth values to sentences .",
    "models are usually defined symbolically in the same way as syntax , and beginners often find it difficult to distinguish between syntax and semantics , as well as to understand the notion of the interpretation of symbols .",
    "thus , some diagrams are used to introduce set - theoretical models .",
    "one famous example is tarski s world of barwise and etchemendy @xcite , which is designed to introduce model theoretic notions diagrammatically .",
    "another traditional example concerns euler diagrams , which were originally introduced in the 18th century to illustrate syllogisms . a basic euler diagram consists of circles and points , and syllogistic sentences",
    "are represented using inclusion and exclusion relations between the circles and points .",
    "a circle in an euler diagram can be considered to represent a set , and a point can be considered as an entity of a given domain .",
    "inclusion and exclusion relations between circles and points can then be considered to represent set - theoretical notions such as subset and disjointness relations , respectively .    besides the traditional informal semantic view",
    ", euler diagrams have recently been investigated syntactically as the counterparts of logical formulas , which constitute formal proofs .",
    "euler diagrams are rigorously defined as syntactic objects , allowing set - theoretical semantics to be defined .",
    "inference systems are also formalized , and they have been shown to be equivalent to some symbolic logical systems . consequently , fundamental logical properties such as soundness and completeness have been investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this way ,",
    "euler diagrams are , on the one hand , regarded as models of given sentences , and on the other hand , they are exploited as syntactic objects that constitute formal proofs .    in this paper",
    ", we present a formal investigation of euler diagrams as set - theoretical models .",
    "we characterize the notions of validity and invalidity using our euler diagrams .",
    "( in @xcite , barwise and etchemendy also suggested a possible application of euler diagrams to construct counter - examples . ) the advantages of our view of euler diagrams as models are as follows : ( 1 ) diagrams provide concrete images of set - theoretical models and counter - models ; ( 2 ) diagrams provide natural images of the interpretation of sentences ; ( 3 ) model and counter - model construction can be captured as concrete manipulations of diagrams .",
    "however , there are the following limitations : ( 1 ) the expressive power of our diagrams is restricted to conjunctions of extended syllogistic sentences ; ( 2 ) not all sets are represented by the circles or simple closed curves of our diagrams ; ( 3 ) diagrams are sometimes misleading if their meaning and manipulations are not precisely defined . regardless",
    ", euler diagrams have recently been defined rigorously from logical viewpoints , and we believe that this restricted fragment is sufficient for an introduction to model theory .    in section [ sectionsyntactic ] , we first review the euler diagrammatic system of @xcite , in which euler diagrams are regarded as syntactic objects corresponding to first - order formulas . then , in section [ sectionvalidity ] , we investigate a view of euler diagrams as counterparts of set - theoretical models .",
    "finally , we investigate how euler diagrams provide counter - models of given inferences in section [ sectioncounter - models ] .",
    "our sentences have the following extended syllogistic form :    ,  @xmath0 is not @xmath1 ,   there is something @xmath1 ,  there is something not @xmath1 ,   + all @xmath2 are @xmath1 ,  no @xmath2 are @xmath1 ,  some @xmath2 are @xmath1 ,  some @xmath2 are not @xmath1 ,    where @xmath0 is a constant and @xmath3 are predicates .",
    "these basic sentences are denoted by @xmath4 , and we also consider their conjunctions .    from a semantic viewpoint ,",
    "every constant @xmath0 is interpreted as an element @xmath5 , and a predicate @xmath1 is interpreted as a _",
    "set @xmath6 in a set - theoretical domain .",
    "then , our syllogistic sentences are interpreted as usual . for example , @xmath0 is @xmath1 is true iff @xmath7 ; all @xmath2 are @xmath1 is true iff @xmath8 , and so on ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that we impose the so - called _ existential import _",
    ", i.e. , the interpretation of @xmath1 is nonempty .",
    "see remark after example [ example5 ] .",
    "we first review the euler diagrammatic system of @xcite , in which euler diagrams are regarded as syntactic objects corresponding to formulas .",
    "our euler diagram , called * eul - diagram * , is defined as a plane with * named circles * ( simple closed curves , denoted by @xmath9 ) and * named points * ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "named points are divided into * constant points * ( @xmath11 ) , which correspond to constants of the first - order language , and * existential points * ( @xmath12 ) , which correspond to bound variables associated with the existential quantifier .",
    "diagrams are denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "+    each diagram is specified by the following inclusion , exclusion , and crossing relations maintained between circles and points .",
    "* eul - relations * consist of the following reflexive asymmetric binary relation @xmath14 , and the irreflexive symmetric binary relations @xmath15 and @xmath16 :    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     eul - relations are denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the set of eul - relations that hold on a diagram @xmath18 is uniquely determined , and we denote this set by @xmath19 . for example , @xmath20 in example [ examplesyllog ] is @xmath21 @xmath22 . in the description of @xmath19 ,",
    "we omit the reflexive relation @xmath23 for each object @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , we often omit relations of the form @xmath25 for points @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which always hold by definition . in the following ,",
    "we consider the equivalence class of diagrams in terms of the eul - relations .    to clarify the intended meaning of our diagrams , we describe the translation of diagrams into the usual first - order formulas .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description of our translation .",
    "each named circle is translated into a unary predicate , and each constant ( resp .",
    "existential ) point is translated into a constant symbol ( resp .",
    "variable ) .",
    "then , each eul - relation @xmath28 is translated into a formula @xmath29 as follows :    * @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; * @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ; * @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath18 be an eul - diagram with the following set of relations : @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and no existential point appears in @xmath38 .",
    "then , the diagram @xmath18 is translated into the following conjunctive formula : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is @xmath41 or @xmath42 depending on @xmath37 .    note",
    "that our diagram is abstractly a `` conjunction of relations . ''",
    "note also that we interpret the @xmath16-relation so that it does not convey any specific ( inclusion or exclusion ) information about the relationship between circles .",
    "( this interpretation is based on the convention of venn diagrams .",
    "see @xcite for further details . )",
    "thus , @xmath43 is translated into a tautology as above .    from a semantic viewpoint , by interpreting circles ( resp .",
    "points ) as _ nonempty _ subsets ( resp .",
    "elements ) of a set - theoretical domain , each `` syntactic object '' eul - diagram is interpreted in terms of the relations that hold on it .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "our system is essentially the same as the _ region connection calculus rcc _ @xcite .",
    "rcc is a topological approach to qualitative spatial representation and reasoning , and is applied , for example , to geographic information system ( gis ) .",
    "rcc investigates eight basic relations , including our inclusion , exclusion , and crossing ( partially overlapping ) , between spatial regions ( circles in our framework ) .",
    "although rcc investigates general @xmath44-dimensional spaces of spatial regions , we concentrate on 2-dimensional diagrams .",

    "hence , it is a counter - diagram for the given inference .",
    "[ remarkexistentialimport ] in our system , we postulate the so - called _ existential import _ in the literature of syllogisms . with this postulate , for example , we have all @xmath2 are @xmath1 , no @xmath1 are @xmath45 @xmath46 some @xmath2 are not @xmath45 , even though this is not valid from the usual logical viewpoint without the existential import . without this postulate ,",
    "two diagrams , say @xmath18 in which @xmath53 holds and @xmath50 in which @xmath54 holds , are consistent when @xmath2 denotes the empty set",
