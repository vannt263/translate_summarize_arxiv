    "b0218 + 357 was discovered with the nrao 140-ft telescope in its strong source survey ( s30218 + 35 ; * ? ? ?",
    "later radio imaging revealed it to be a gravitationally lensed blazar with the smallest separation double - image known ( 335 milli - arcseconds ) , and an einstein ring with a similar angular diameter @xcite .",
    "the lens galaxy is at redshift @xmath7 @xcite , and the blazar was later securely measured at @xmath8 @xcite .    shortly after the lens discovery ,",
    "@xcite measured a time delay @xcite @xmath9 days ( @xmath2 quoted throughout unless otherwise specified ) at radio wavelengths , using the vla to spatially separate and monitor the polarization variability in its leading brighter a ( western ) and fainter b ( eastern ) images . later independent ( but contemporaneous )",
    "dual - frequency vla observations further refined the delay , @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 days @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite analyzed the latter s measurements and found two possible delays , @xmath12 or @xmath13 days .",
    "although these delays span a narrow range , @xmath14 days , because of the differing assumptions and analysis techniques employed in these works , there remains some debate on how to best derive their uncertainties .",

    "photon index , @xmath17 ) and overall spectral energy distribution are typical of an otherwise normal  emitting flat - spectrum radio quasar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while  data lack the necessary spatial resolution to separate lensed images , such blazars display their most dramatic variability in , and the lat s all - sky monitoring could give it a distinct advantage over lower - frequency imaging observations in parameterizing lensed systems .",
    "indeed , @xcite proposed prior to s launch that the lat could detect delayed emission from such gravitationally lensed blazars using integrated lightcurves for sufficiently bright  flares . b0218 + 357",
    "was found to be variable in the early lat observations , though only modestly so ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ figure-1 ] ) .",
    "bright  flaring from b0218 + 357 was detected with the lat beginning late 2012 august @xcite , and a delayed flare was tentatively identified @xmath18 days later @xcite , consistent with the radio delay measurements .",
    "the blazar then displayed even brighter , more sustained flaring activity beginning september 14 , thus prompting a  target - of - opportunity ( too ) pointed observation @xcite that traced the anticipated delayed emission in detail .",
    "two main additional flaring events were subsequently observed in as many months ( see figure  [ figure-1 ] for an overview ) .",
    "we discuss the   temporal and spectral properties of b0218 + 357 together with the derived time lag , flare timescales , and observed flux ratios of the a / b images .",
    "the -lat operates in a default sky - survey mode , and over every two @xmath191.6-hr spacecraft orbits , provides observations covering the entire sky .",
    "we used lat observations with the p7source@xmath20v6 instrument response functions , selecting 100 mev  100 gev events with a region of interest ( roi ) of radius = 15  centered at the b0218 + 357 radio position , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( j2000 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the maximum zenith angle of 100  was set to minimize the contamination from earth limb photons as well as the appropriate gtmktime filter ( @xmath233 ) following the fssc recommendations[multiblock footnote omitted ] for the combination of sky - survey and pointed observations .",
    "the gtlike likelihood in the @xmath24 science tools ( version v9r27p1 ) was used for the spectral analysis , assuming throughout a single power - law model for b0218 + 357 over the selected energy range ( as in the 2fgl catalog ) .",
    "the background model included all 2fgl sources within the roi as well as the galactic ( gal@xmath202yearp7v6@xmath20v0.fits ) and isotropic ( iso@xmath20p7v6source.txt ) diffuse components .    in generating each lightcurve ,",
    "the isotropic normalization was left free to vary in each time - bin while the two known variable 2fgl sources within a @xmath25 roi and the galactic normalization were initially fitted over each full interval , then fixed at the average fitted values in the shorter time - bins . as a convenient reference point",
    ", we define @xmath26 days ( i.e. , @xmath27 was 2012 june 22 ) , the time when  flaring became obvious . integrating 1417 days ( @xmath28 years ) of lat observations prior to this date",
    "gave an average @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , consistent with the 2fgl value .",
    "for context , we generated a 1-week binned lightcurve for 5-years of data ( 2008 august 5 - 2013 august 6 ; figure  [ figure-1 ] , top ) assuming a fixed @xmath31 .",
    "besides the modest source activity in early 2009 and 2010 , the pronounced flaring beginning in mid-2012 lasting for @xmath32 days is apparent ; thereafter , the source quieted again to earlier levels .    in order to study the flaring activity in detail , we defined a 265-day interval starting at @xmath27 days and generated 1-day and 6-hr binned lightcurves .",
    "the  too observations also allowed us to produce a @xmath191.6-hr orbit - by - orbit binned lightcurve for the sub - interval covering the first delayed flare from 2012 september 24 - october 1 ( @xmath33 days ) . to search for any possible spectral changes , we initially computed the 1-day binned lightcurve with the photon index free in the fit .",
    "for the 108 points with the greatest significance ( test statistic , assuming one degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath34 ) , we found all but four points within @xmath35 of the weighted average value of @xmath36 , which in turn is consistent with the 3.9-yr average .",
    "we thus regenerated the 1-day ( figure  [ figure-1 ] , middle ) , the 1.6-hr orbit ( figure  [ figure-1 ] , bottom ) , and the 6-hr binned lightcurves ( figure  [ figure-2 ] ) with @xmath31 fixed .",
    "the b0218 + 357  lightcurve appears quite complex with many peaks and valleys over the @xmath5 months from @xmath37 days ( figure  [ figure-2 ] ) when the source was most active . to search for a time lag , we computed the auto - correlation function ( acf ) for the 6-hr binned lightcurve up to lag values of half of the total defined 265-day flaring interval .",
    "this evenly sampled lightcurve consisted of 1057 measurements with three missing data points due to exposure gaps .",
    "the acf was therefore computed both by a standard ( after interpolating the three missing points ) and a discrete routine @xcite .",
    "the two procedures gave almost identical results and the acf is shown in figure  [ figure-3 ] .",
    "a single prominent correlation peak is apparent between the time lag range of @xmath38 days .",
    "the peak s significance is @xmath39 with respect to the measurement noise and comparing it to the height above the acf `` background . ''",
    "fitting a gaussian function to this peak , we estimated a best - fit value , @xmath40 days ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "uncertainties were estimated by a model independent monte carlo method @xcite accounting for the effects of measurement noise and data sampling .",
    "the time lag does not match any known period observed with the lat @xcite . because the   flaring was so pronounced especially from @xmath41 days , and appears to be broadly divided into three @xmath4 day long flare / delay sequences ( section  3.2 ) , this could induce other smaller enhancements in the acf over the studied interval .    as a cross - check of the lag derived from the full flaring interval  data ,",
    "discrete acfs were computed for two segments from @xmath42 and @xmath43 days .",
    "the lags obtained from gaussian fits to the peaks were , @xmath44 and @xmath45 days , respectively , confirming the delay value and small uncertainty for the full interval , thus indicating that we obtained a robust measurement with the lat .",
    "the small uncertainty in @xmath46 is competitive with the best determined radio measurements for b0218 + 357 although the former is marginally larger by @xmath47 and @xmath48 days ( @xmath2 ) than the @xcite and @xcite values , respectively , but consistent with the @xcite values",
    ". if the radio/  delays are intrinsically different due to an offset between the respective emitting regions , the implied offset in a singular isothermal sphere lens model is @xmath49 pc ( projected ) for a @xmath50 difference in the time delay .",
    "this seems extreme considering such offsets are on average @xmath51 pc in other blazar jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may rather suggest the uncertainty in the radio delay was underestimated ( section  1 ) .      utilizing the @xmath52-ray delay measurement",
    ", we can broadly identify three sets of flare / delay episodes in the 6-hr binned lat lightcurve of b0218 + 357 ( figure  [ figure-2 ] ) .",
    "the pre - flare times were what triggered the initial excitement in late 2012 august and are now detailed as a 6-hr flare at @xmath53 days ( with a corresponding delayed signal 11.5 days later ) and a doublet of @xmath54-hr flares 1 day apart beginning at @xmath55 day . in the doublet , only the first flare showed a clear delayed flare 11.5 days later while the second shows no similar corresponding delayed ( or 11.5-day prior ) feature ; microlensing ( see below ) or a relatively large variation in the magnification ratio are possible explanations .",
    "the first bright  sequence began at @xmath56 day with the best - defined flaring structure with observed fluxes , @xmath57  over eight consecutive 6-hr bins , followed by a sharp drop and subsequent rise in one day .",
    "the  too observation began 10  days later and the anticipated delayed emission mirrored the initial flare with the rise and peak separated by 1 day and all features well - matched 11.5 days later .",
    "we broadly identified two subsequent ( 2nd and 3rd ) @xmath4 day duration  flaring sequences , but these were more difficult to disentangle because of superposing flares in the integrated lightcurves .",
    "the post - flare intervals showed lower fluxes , comparable to the pre - flare emission states .    in figure  [ figure-2 ] , the observed variability timescales",
    "( doubling and halving ) , @xmath58 , during the first and subsequent two flaring episodes are securely less than the 6-hr binning .",
    "doubling timescales as short as 2-orbits ( @xmath59 hrs ) are further suggested in the orbit - by - orbit binned lightcurve from the  too pointing of the first delayed flare ( figure  [ figure-1 ] , bottom ) .",
    "such timescales are amongst the fastest well - constrained  variability in a blazar observed with the lat @xcite and constrain the  emission region diameter , @xmath60  cm , modulo the unknown doppler beaming factor . assuming an @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) cosmology , this translates to an angular diameter @xmath63 nano - arcseconds , @xmath64 smaller than the best radio size constraint @xcite .",
    "microlensing is thus an important factor in interpreting our  results because the smaller the structures , the larger the expected variability of magnification .      adopting the  delay , we compared the 6-hr binned lightcurves for the three main flaring episodes with the observations shifted by @xmath65 days and computed the observed ratios between corresponding flux pairs , retaining only ratio values @xmath66 their uncertainties ( figure  [ figure-4 ] ) .",
    "the first sequence appears to show the clearest correspondence between features in the two lightcurves , with only minor deviations about the weighted average flux ratio @xmath67 . by subtracting a baseline ,",
    "@xmath68  ( the minimum observed flux during the overall flaring interval ) , we can further estimate a corresponding magnification ratio in  @xmath69 , consistent with the flux ratio .",
    "the average ratios for this first sequence seem to imply the brighter a image led the b image in , as observed in the radio .",
    "more conservatively however , given the large uncertainties in the individual measurements , the flux ratios appear consistent with unity .",
    "moreover , for the subsequent 2nd and 3rd sequences , the correspondences between the flare and delayed emissions were less clear .",
    "sharp and more scattered changes in the paired flux ratios were apparent , including values @xmath70 ( which would imply a fainter leading a image ) . we interpret this as an artifact due to contamination from superposing flares after the source has already entered a very active phase .",
    "this confusion in the integrated lightcurves prevents us from reliably determining magnification ratios , and how variable this quantity may have been .",
    "the flux ratio measured in  is smaller than in the radio .",
    "@xcite found a small , but statistically significant frequency dependence in the flux ratios , @xmath71 ( 8 ghz ) and @xmath72 ( 15 ghz ) , while @xcite found similar values but with larger uncertainty , @xmath73 ( 8 ghz ) and @xmath74 ( 15 ghz ) .",
    "frequency dependence in the flux ratios of the two radio images and their observed substructures could be possibly due to free - free absorption and scattering from a molecular cloud in the lens galaxy @xcite .",
    "we note that the radio and  observations are not simultaneous and magnification ratios could be variable with time .",
    "further complicating such comparisons are open questions in blazar jet studies , i.e. , the radio and  emitting regions need not coincide , with the latter likely more compact ( section  3.2 ) , and whether successive  flares originated in a single emission zone or from separate relativistically moving dissipation regions along the jet .",
    "excursions could also be due to intrinsic changes in the magnification ratios or microlensing from the relative motion of the source seen through a clumpy lensing galaxy .",
    "indeed , microlensing in the context of extremely compact  emission zones @xcite could explain the single 6-hr flare points that do not have corresponding lags ( marked with asterisks in figure  [ figure-2 ] ) , although fast superposed flares are also a possibility . note that in optical and infrared observations , the b image appears brighter than the a image , i.e. , reversed from the radio situation , and this is likely due to a combination of extinction of the a image and microlensing @xcite .",
    "our detection of a gravitational lens time delay , @xmath40 days , in the lat observations of blazar b0218 + 357 has some interesting potential implications for future  studies .",
    "foremost , the lat detection of a   gravitational lens flaring event in b0218 + 357 suggests that such a measurement is possible in other blazars . in particular ,",
    "gravitational lenses found in surveys of flat - spectrum radio sources @xcite comprise a relevant sample as these form the basis of candidate  blazar catalogs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are @xmath75 gravitational lenses from these surveys out of @xmath76 radio sources studied with @xmath77 mjy at 8 ghz and so far , the two radio brightest are detected  sources , pks1830211 ( below ) and b0218 + 357 ( out of @xmath78 known  blazars ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other fainter lensed systems are typically less variable at radio frequencies , making delay measurements difficult ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and while they are not yet reported  sources , the all - sky monitoring of -lat will allow the detection of short - timescale flaring  activity in which to attempt delay measurements .",
    "importantly ,  measurements constrain lens parameters free of propagation effects like scintillation @xcite that can hamper radio delay attempts @xcite , although microlensing may be an important limiting factor because  emitting regions are expected to be more compact than in the radio .",
    "the case of b0218 + 357 appears to be the first clear case of a  detected gravitational lens time delay for any astrophysical system .",
    "previously ,   flaring from the gravitationally lensed @xmath79 blazar pks1830211 was detected with the -lat @xcite with a claimed delay , @xmath80 days @xcite consistent with the radio measurement , @xmath81 days @xcite . subsequent analysis of more lat data , including several prominent flares , did not confirm the  delay @xcite .",
    "if the  delay in pks1830211 is assumed to be the same as the radio - measured delay , the non - detection of delayed  flares implies a magnification ratio in  much larger ( @xmath82 ) than that observed in the radio ( @xmath83 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus opposite of what we observed in b0218 + 357 .",
    "with only two examples studied , no trend is clear .",
    "however , if microlensing effects can be disentangled ( and in fact utilized as additional constraints on the emitting region source size ) , magnification ratios in radio and  arising from spatially distinct emission regions may be utilized as a probe of differing multi - frequency jet structures ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a time delay due to gravitational lensing of a background source by a foreground object can constrain hubble s parameter @xcite . the original lens model for b0218 + 357",
    "@xcite predicted a delay , @xmath84 days ( @xmath85 confidence ) . utilizing improved localization of the lensing galaxy",
    ", the delay model uncertainty was reduced to @xmath86 @xcite , thus deriving @xmath87 , assuming the often quoted @xcite measured radio delay ( cf .",
    ", section  3.1 ) . adopting the york model for our independent  measured delay results in @xmath88 , where this quoted uncertainty is due only to the time delay estimate and the statistical uncertainty in the mass model .",
    "systematic errors in the modeling , and additional uncertainty due to line - of - sight structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will likely significantly increase this .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting that the lat time delay brings the estimated value of hubble s constant down , towards the low end of modern measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an underdense environment would require this inferred @xmath89 value to increase ; including external lensing effects in future cosmographic analyses might be important in this system .",
    "moreover , since the radio and  emission regions are likely not co - spatial , the assumed radio - derived time - delay function values may be inaccurate .",
    "a fully self - consistent joint modeling of the radio and  source is needed to resolve this .",
    "if the lat can measure a lag in the  lightcurve of one of the previously known systems with wider separation or in a new example ( below ) , this can give independent  based constraints on hubble s constant .",
    "one exciting result would be the detection of a lens delay in a flaring   source that is not yet identified as a gravitationally lensed system at radio wavelengths or otherwise .",
    "these could possibly be lensed image pairs with flat - spectrum radio sources at smaller separations than in the 0.2   resolution of vla surveys ( references above ) .",
    "similar radio lens surveys in the southern hemisphere are not yet as complete ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so a   delay signature in their lat lightcurves could betray the presence of a previously unknown lens system .",
    "such a strategy has been proposed for future wide - field optical surveys @xcite , and the discovery potential of the lat in  should now be recognized .",
    "furthermore , with the different flux ratios at radio and  wavelengths , and possible variability of the ratio , some sources could be bright in  and less conspicuous at radio .",
    "such potential gravitational lenses could be hidden in plain sight within the radio catalogs used for blazar associations in lat catalogs , or could be amongst the currently unidentified  sources @xcite .",
    "the -lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
