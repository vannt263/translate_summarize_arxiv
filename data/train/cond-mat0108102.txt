    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the quantal dynamics of elementary electron and hole quasiparticle excitations existing within and in the vicinity of a normal - state region of matter that is completely surrounded by an essentially infinite region of conventional superconductor .",
    "the entire system  normal - state region and superconducting surround  may be envisaged as three - dimensional , although the approach that we shall be developing is applicable in any number of dimensions .",
    "owing to the inability of the surrounding superconductor to support propagating quasiparticle excitations at sufficiently low energies , electron and hole quasiparticle excitations at such energies are bound to the normal - state region and its vicinity , and it is on the properties of such bound states that we shall be focusing our attention .    the process responsible for the confinement of these excitations to the normal - state region and its vicinity is _",

    "@xcite from the surrounding superconducting condensate ; we shall therefore refer to such structures , near to which quasiparticles are confined , as _",
    "andreev billiards_. andreev billiards were introduced and certain simple aspects of their classical dynamics were discussed in ref .",
    "a very brief account of the approach and results contained in the present paper were reported in ref .",
    "certain quantum - mechanical properties of s were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we explore the quantal dynamics of quasiparticle excitations of andreev billiards , our primary focus will be on the relationship between the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum and the geometrical shape of the normal - state region , i.e. , the question of _ spectral geometry _ in this novel setting of excitations confined by a superconducting pair - potential . in the setting of _ conventional billiard _ systems  @xcite confinement is , by contrast , accomplished by an infinite ( or occasionally finite ) single - particle potential  @xcite . as mentioned above , we shall primarily be concerned with _ confined _ quasiparticle states , and therefore in energy eigenvalues lying within the quasiparticle gap of the surrounding superconductor ( although our approach is also suited to the study of scattering states ) .",
    "the strategy that we shall develop is inspired by the beautiful work of balian and bloch , in which , _",
    "inter alia _ , the eigenvalue spectrum of the laplace operator was investigated for generically - shaped spatial regions and various types of boundary conditions  @xcite . the central theme of the work of balian and bloch is the relationship between the boundary shape , the type of boundary conditions , and the the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "we shall refer to refs .",
    "@xcite respectively as  , , and .",
    "as it is so central to the properties of andreev billiards , let us pause to review the core qualitative features of the andreev reflection process : to a high degree of accuracy it ( i )  interconverts electron and hole excitations ; and ( ii )  reverses the velocity of excitations .",
    "it is this latter , _ retro - reflective _ , character of the andreev reflection process that endows andreev billiards with dynamical characteristics quite distinct from those of conventional billiards , in which confinement is caused by _",
    "specular reflection _ from a single - particle potential .",
    "we shall take as a model for the normal - state region of an andreev billiard a fermi gas , parametrized by the fermi energy .",
    "thus , in the normal - state region we shall be neglecting the effects of band structure , impurity scattering , and quasiparticle interactions .",
    "we shall account for the superconducting nature of the matter surrounding the normal - state region by asserting that there is a superconducting pair - potential @xmath1 that varies discontinuously : inside the normal - state region @xmath2 ; outside the normal - state region @xmath1 takes on the constant value @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we shall refer to the surface on which @xmath1 changes discontinuously as the shape of the andreev billiard .",
    "thus , we shall not be working self - consistently , but shall benefit from being in a position to develop an interface - scattering approach to the quasiparticle dynamics , in which we are able to focus on processes occurring at the interface .",
    "hence , we can incorporate in a direct and natural manner the impact of the shape of the billiard ( i.e.  the shape of the interface ) on the spectrum of energy eigenvalues of the confined electron - hole quasiparticles .",
    "we see four principal sources of motivation for the present work .",
    "first , andreev billiards provide a novel setting for the exploration of spectrum - shape relationships , a branch of mathematics with a distinguished history  @xcite .",
    "the novelty is fed in by the andreev reflection process occuring at the normal - to - superconductor boundary .",
    "second , the usual spectral - geometric scenario [ in which deviations of the density of modes from its large - system limit become appreciable as the wavelength become comparable to the characteristic linear size of the system ] is not the whole story for the case of andreev billiards . instead , owing to the presence of a second , much larger , lengthscale , set by the difference between the momenta of incident electrons and the holes they become upon andreev reflection ( and _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "as this momenutm difference is small ( on the scale of the fermi momentum ) , the corresponding lengthscale is much larger that the fermi wavelength . through this new lengthscale",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum can be sensitive to the shape of the billiard even when the characteristic size of the billiard is much larger than the underlying wave length associated with quasiparticle motion .",
    "this relevance of the new lengthscale has long been appreciated , showing up , e.g. , in the effectively one - dimensional settings of tomasch  @xcite and mcmillan - rowell  @xcite oscillations in the tunneling density of states above the superconducting gap , and in de  gennes  saint - james bound states  @xcite below the superconducting gap third , as we shall see when we develop a trace formula for the ( oscillatory part of the ) density of quasiparticle eigenstates ( dos ) , there turns out to be a novel and useful separation in the scale of periods of the two dominating classes of ( primitive , classical , periodic ) trajectories that feature . as a consequence",
    ", the dos will comprise : ( i )  a relatively smooth contribution due to retracings of geometrical chords across the billiard of stationary lengths , dressed by ( ii )  a more rapidly varying contribution arising from orbits located near the boundary and involving charge - preserving as well as charge - interconverting reflection processes .",
    "thus , from the oscillatory part of the dos one can hear  aspects of the shape of the billiard such as the stationary values of the lengths of the chord ) .",
    "we are not aware of any other spectral - geometric contexts that feature this type of information .",
    "fourth , the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum , and its sensitivity to the shape of the billiard , should be experimentally accessible , e.g. , via tunneling spectroscopy on hybrid superconducting / normal - state structures .",
    "the current state of microfabrication technology makes such experiments realizable  @xcite .",
    "we see the following as the principal results of the present work .",
    "first , we provide the machinery for computing the green function for andreev billiards of arbitrary shape in terms of a multiple scattering expansion that focuses on the influence of the billiard shape .",
    "second , we implement this machinery to construct two semiclassical schemes ( resulting in two semiclassical trace formulas ) for computing the oscillatory component of the dos .",
    "one , which we shall refer to as scheme  a , simply amounts to an elaboration ( to billiards of arbitrary shape ) of andreev s approximation .",
    "thus , it gives a dos that takes the form of an integral over the chords of the normal - state region with an appropriate weight function .",
    "hence , it realizes the intuitively natural notion that the chords , being the periodic orbits at the andreev level , determine the energy eigenvalue spectrum , according to bohr - sommerfeld quantization conditions .",
    "the other , scheme  b , captures certain physical effects that are inaccessible to scheme  a , such as mesoscale oscillations in the dos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . following the present introduction and overview we define , in sec .",
    "[ sec : bdab ] , andreev billiards and present the corresponding bogoliubov  de  gennes ( ) eigenproblem . in this section",
    "we also introduce the green function for the  eigenproblem and provide its connection to the dos , and review the standard _",
    "quasiclassical _ approach to the  eigenproblem , due to andreev . in sec .",
    "[ sec : muscex ] we formulate the computation of the green function in terms of an expansion in which the basic processes are reflection from and transmission through the interface separating the normal(n ) and superconducting(s ) regions .",
    "we then make a physically - motivated reorganization of this expansion , which will later allow us to integrate out states in the s region , thus obtaining a description solely in terms of states within the billiard .",
    "( section  [ sec : muscex ] is the technical basis of the paper ; however , it may safely be omitted by readers wishing to focus on results rather than methods.)after this exact reformulation we proceed , in sec .",
    "[ sec : asmuscex ] , to integrate out the states in the s region within an approximation scheme valid for short waves .",
    "in this way , we obtain an effective multiple reflection ( rather than scattering ) expansion .",
    "we continue , in sec .",
    "[ sec : denofstates ] , by following certain approximation strategies that allow us to compute the dos at various levels of energy - resolution , in each case obtaining the corresponding trace formula .",
    "this section is the heart of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summ ] we make some concluding remarks and hint at some possible applications of the ideas we have presented .",
    "we have relegated to appendices some background material , including a derivation of the  wave equation and the rudiments of boundary integral methods , as well as some technical and parenthetical passages .",
    "the physical system of interest in the present paper is an andreev billiard of arbitrary shape , i.e. , a normal - state region embedded inside an infinite superconducting region , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : and_bill ] .",
    "following gorkov s mean - field approach to superconductivity  @xcite , we describe the system by the ( variable particle - number ) hamiltonian @xmath5 , given by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the effective electron mass , @xmath8 is the electron chemical potential ( which we take to be uniform throughout the system ) , @xmath9 is a given superconducting pair - potential which characterizes the superconducting condensate , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are creation and annihilation field operators for electron quasiparticles having position @xmath12 and spin - projection @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the dimension of space ( typically two or three ) .",
    "we shall not go beyond the picture of quasiparticle excitations propagating in the presence of a superconducting condensate implied by this description .",

    "thus , it is adequate to address states of the form @xmath16 which are described by the two - component complex - valued amplitudes @xmath17 , i.e. , the family of one - quasiparticle excited states .    to derive the equation of motion for these one - quasiparticle states ( i.e.  the so - called time - dependent  equation  @xcite ) ,",
    "we follow andreev  @xcite and suppose that the system is in some ( heisenberg - representation ) one - quasiparticle excited state @xmath18",
    ". then the amplitude @xmath19 for finding the state at time @xmath20 to be the ground state with an up - spin electron quasiparticle added at position @xmath12 ( i.e.  the heisenberg - representation state @xmath21 ) is given by    @xmath22    similarly , the amplitude @xmath23 for finding the state at time @xmath20 to be the ground state with a down spin electron quasiparticle removed at position @xmath12 ( i.e.  the heisenberg - representation state @xmath24 ) is given by @xmath25    here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , heisenberg - representation field operators .",
    "thus , the wave functions @xmath19 and @xmath23 serve as amplitudes for the present up - spin electron quasiparticle and the absent down - spin electron ( i.e.  up - spin hole ) quasiparticle .",
    "then , by virtue of the heisenberg equation of motion for the field operators ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite , sec .",
    "6 ) , together with the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : gorkov ] ) , it is a straightforward exercise in computing commutators of field operators to show that the amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath23 evolve according to the appropriate time - dependent schrdinger equation , i.e. , the time - dependent equation : @xmath28 analysis of this equation via the separation of the time variable , appropriate when there is no external time - dependence , leads to the  eigenproblem @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a ( collective ) index for all quantum numbers and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the corresponding energy eigenvalues and ( two - component ) eigenfunctions .    in general , @xmath1 may vary spatially .",
    "however , we shall consider the situation in which deep inside the superconductor @xmath1 goes to a constant value @xmath3 , whereas throughout the normal metal it vanishes . in the intermediate region ( i.e.  within a superconducting coherence length outside of the billiard boundary )",
    "@xmath1 is suppressed to a value smaller than @xmath3 , and falls to zero as the n region is entered .",
    "we shall ignore the effects of this suppression and assume that @xmath1 varies discontinuously between @xmath33 to @xmath3 at a surface , which we refer to as the billiard boundary and denote by @xmath34 , that divides the system into two homogeneous regions , the billard interior ( denoted @xmath35 ) and the billiard exterior ( denoted @xmath36 ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we further assume that there are no metallurgical differences between the normal - state and superconducting regions , inasmuch as the only difference between them is the value of the pair potential ( the effective mass , e.g. , being common ) .    to ease the notation",
    "we shall adopt units in which @xmath37 . to recover results in terms of the original physical units , one multiplies the three variables having the dimensions of energy [ viz .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 by the factor @xmath40 .",
    "the  eigenproblem plays the same role for andreev billiards that the schrdinger eigenproblem plays for conventional billiards .",
    "if a conventional billiard is surrounded by a region in which the single - particle potential is _ infinite _ then we refer to the billiard as a _ hard _ billiard , and the schrdinger equation _ outside",
    "_ the billiard is replaced by the homogeneous dirichlet ( i.e.  vanishing ) boundary condition on the schrdinger eigenfunction , this boundary condition leading to the quantization of the eigenvalue spectrum . if , on the other hand , a conventional billiard is surrounded by a region in which the single - particle potential is _ finite _ then we refer to the billiard as a _ soft _ billiard , and the solution to the schrdinger equation _ outside _ must be matched on to the the solution of the schrdinger equation _ inside _ , this matching leading to the quantization of the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "the andreev billiard is , therefore , analogous to a _",
    "soft _ schrdinger billiard ; its hard limit seems difficult to realize because , at least in known superconductors , the pair potential is far smaller than the chemical potential .",
    "the eigenproblem for andreev billiards , then , is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tibdg ] ) with @xmath41 for @xmath12 inside the billiard , and @xmath42 for @xmath12 outside the billiard .",
    "thus , we are faced with the task of addressing the  eigenproblem for the case in which the system comprises two spatially homogeneous regions ( one normal , one superconducting ) that meet at a closed surface .",
    "owing to the spatial homogeneity of these regions , the general solution of the equation can readily be obtained in each region .",
    "the quantization of the eigenvalue spectrum results from the matching of the solutions and their normal derivatives across this surface , together with the confinement of the eigenfunctions to the vicinity of the andeev billiard .",
    "the resulting spectrum depends , therefore , on the shape of this surface .",
    "exploring this dependence is the central aim of the present work",
    ". it would be straightforward to extend the present framework to handle issues such as josephson coupling between superconducting regions , scattering from andreev billiards , etc .",
    "the spectrum of eigenvalues of the  wave equation @xmath31 is assembled into the dos @xmath43 , which is defined as @xmath44 as is commonly the case , it is convenient to approach @xmath43 via a green function for the  wave equation , which we now introduce .",
    "the ( @xmath45 matrix ) green function @xmath46 for the  wave equation is defined by the following matrix partial differential equation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the complex energy and @xmath49 is the ( @xmath45 ) identity matrix . under the far - field boundary condition @xmath50 as @xmath51",

    "however , being a sum of delta functions , @xmath61 is not a smooth function and can , therefore , be extremely awkward to approximate .",
    "in order to find approximations to @xmath61 it is preferable to seek a continuous function that carries essentially the same information as it .",
    "one candidate is the _ smoothed _ dos @xmath62 , defined via @xmath63 where @xmath64 is some smoothing function and @xmath65 is the ( real ) smoothing width .",
    "we remark , parenthetically , that any dos derived from experiment will be smoothed to some extent , depending on the resolving power of the apparatus and/or the lifetime of the single - particle excitations .",
    "there are several possible choices for the smoothing fuction @xmath64 , including , e.g. , lorentzian , gaussian and logarithmic - gaussian .",
    "it is also possible to define a continuous integral transform of @xmath43 that is , itself , a physical property , and for which we can derive some approximation .",
    "for example , under the lambert transform of @xmath61 , which exchanges energy for temperature , @xmath61 is transformed into the total ( equilibrium internal ) energy as a function of temperature  @xcite . which smoothing procedure is the best choice depends on the method used to approximate @xmath43 . for green - function  based methods , such as the one we shall adopt , the lorentzian smoothing function",
    ", @xmath66 is the most appropriate , for reasons that should become clear below .",
    "we now give the analogue of eq .",

    "we derive the fundamental ( i.e.  homogeneous ) normal - state green function , the first of two green functions that are central to the construction of the green function for an andreev billiard . along the way",
    ", we introduce some convenient notation that we shall subsequently make use of .",
    "this fundamental green function is the translationally - invariant solution @xmath70 of the equation    @xmath71    where @xmath72 are the three pauli matrices , together with the boundary condition that the green function vanishes at infinity : @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 which is , of course , a matrix in electron / hole space .",
    "the two terms inside the parantheses are quite familiar : they are the usual green functions of the helmholtz wave equation , and can be evaluated in the standard way . in three dimensions ,",
    "e.g. , one has @xmath75 the symbols @xmath76 , which will be used throughout this paper , denote particle and hole wave numbers , and are given by the expressions @xmath77 where it is understood that the roots having positive real parts are the ones that are adopted .",
    "then , for the three - dimensional case , one arrives at the the fundamental green function for the normal state : @xmath78 this green function has the expected form : an outgoing spherical wave in the particle component ( i.e.  the particle green function ) and an incoming spherical wave in the hole component ( i.e.  the hole green function ) , the latter representing an outgoing hole .",
    "moreover , as we expect in the normal state , there is no mixing between the particle and hole components , the off - diagonal elements being zero .",
    "next , we introduce some convenient notation for the components of this fundamental green function , viz . , @xmath79 in terms of which @xmath80 becomes @xmath81      the fundamental green function for a homogeneous superconducuting region is the translationally invariant solution @xmath82 of the equation : @xmath83 together with the boundary condition that it vanishes as @xmath84 goes to infinity . here",

    "this approximation scheme was put forth by andreev  @xcite , and we shall refer to it as andreev s approximation .",
    "it takes advantage of the fact that for typical n - s systems the dimensionless parameter @xmath104 is much less than unity .",
    "the scheme consists of the separation of rapid and slow oscillations in the wavefunction .",
    "it can be motivated in the following way : consider an arbitrary n - s structure ( i.e.  arbitrary @xmath105 ) .",
    "suppose that the electronic properties of the system are probed during a short time @xmath106 , so that there is insufficient energy resolution around @xmath107 to resolve @xmath9 .",
    "then no measurement obtained via this probe is capable of distinguishing between the original system and a system described by the same equation but with @xmath108 set to zero .",
    "an energy resolution of @xmath109 around @xmath107 corresponds to a momentum resolution of @xmath110 which , via the heisenberg uncertainty relation , corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath111 .",

    "( [ eq : andreev_pde ] ) to andreev billiards .",
    "first , it is useful to express the variable @xmath12 in terms of @xmath124 ( i.e.  the impact parameter or , equivalently , the transverse parameter ) , and @xmath125 ( i.e.  the longitudinal parameter ) such that @xmath126 notice that @xmath124 represents the transverse degree(s ) of freedom whereas @xmath125 represents the longitudinal degree of freedom of the excitation . as , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : andreev_pde ] ) , there is no differential operator acting on the variable @xmath124 , the wavefunctions take the form @xmath127 where @xmath128 can be interpreted as the transverse quantum number . by substituting this form into eq .",
    "( [ eq : andreev_pde ] ) one obtains @xmath129 thus , one has reduced the partial differential eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : tibdg ] ) to a family of approximate ordinary differential eigenvalue equations parametrized by @xmath130 .    now , for andreev billiards @xmath131 is real and piecewise constant . in this case , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : andreev_pde ] ) proceeds as follows . the parameters @xmath130 fix a line , which determines @xmath132 , in the sense that @xmath133 .",
    "as @xmath132 is piecewise constant , the task of solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : andreev_ode ] ) is straightforward .",
    "the quantization condition depends on the chord length @xmath134 [ i.e.  the length of the part of the line ( specified by @xmath130 ) lying inside n ] : @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "thus , for each chord there is a ladder of energy eigenvalues . in order to obtain the dos one",
    "must first obtain the dos for a single chord , and then sum over all chords .",
    "however , it is not _ a priori _ completely clear what weight should be assigned to each chord in performing the continuous summation .",
    "in fact , as we shall see in sec .  [ sec : saandreev ] , at the andreev level of approximation the dos for a ( convex , @xmath14-dimensional ) andreev billiard is given by @xmath138 the two @xmath139-dimensional integrations , one over @xmath115 and one over @xmath124 , implement the summation over chords .",
    "we now construct a multiple scattering expansion capable of yielding the green function @xmath140 associated with the  equation  ( [ eq : gbdg ] ) , in settings in which @xmath108 is piecewise constant ( i.e.  takes on certain constant values in various regions of space that are delineated by @xmath141-dimensional surfaces ) . although the construction is applicable to a wider range of settings , we shall have in mind the application to an andreev billiard , for which @xmath108 vanishes inside the billiard and has a constant nonzero value @xmath3 outside it .",
    "the spirit of our approach very much parallels that of bb - i , although there there are significant differences arising from ( i )  the form of the eigenproblem (  rather than laplace ) , and ( ii )  our need to employ matching ( rather than boundary ) conditions .    in this section",
    "we set up the general formalism for the exact  green function for the case in which the system is divided , via a change in the pair potential , into at least two distinct regions .",
    "as we shall see , the exact green function can be expressed as a sum , generated by an interation scheme , over all possible scatterings from the boundary dividing these regions .",

    "we now introduce a convenient parametrization of the green function @xmath140 .",
    "we do this by decomposing @xmath140 into a particular integral and a complementary function .",

    "the wavevector is changed because the wave enters a medium with a distinct index of refraction . in the case of andreev reflection ,",
    "the wavevector is instead changed because the electron wave is converted into a hole wave , the latter having a distinct dispersion relation .",
    "in fact , by reversing the sign of the phase for a hole wave , as well as the direction of propagation of the hole wave , one transforms the andreev reflection process into the familiar optical refraction process .",

    "second , recall that by green s theorem one has @xmath718 where @xmath719 is _ any _ helmhotz green function ( i.e.  not necessarily the fundamental one ) . in the most common setting , one then chooses the green function that satisfies the homogeneous version of the boundary condition on @xmath666 , thus eliminating all absent boundary information and arriving at an expression for @xmath711 in terms of information known about @xmath666 on @xmath34 . here , instead , one takes a different tack .",
    "one selects for @xmath720 the _ fundamental _ green function @xmath701 , jettisons the first contribution to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenthm ] ) , and accommodates for this by replacing the boundary information on @xmath721 by the ( as - yet unknown ) single - layer @xmath716 .    representations of wave functions by surface integrals are available in other settings , too .",
    "we have considered wave functions satisfying the helmholtz wave equation _ outside _ the region @xmath35",

    "one can also consider wave functions satisfying the helmholtz wave equation _ inside _ the region @xmath35",

    "furthermore , one can parametrize wave functions satisfying the helmholtz wave equation in other ways . for example , consider wave functions inside the region @xmath35 , which one can parametrize as @xmath722 in this case @xmath711 is the helmholtz wave function due to a _ layer of dipoles _ on @xmath34 of local strength @xmath723 and local orientation normal to @xmath34 at each point @xmath151 .",

    "( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) follows because @xmath12 and @xmath362 are never coincident , so that @xmath717 solves eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) for any @xmath362 .",
    "motivation for the parametrization  ( [ eq : spa ] ) also follows from consideration of green s theorem , eq .",
    "( [ eq : greenthm ] ) , but with the _ second _ contribution on the right hand side being jettisoned , rather than the _ first_.    there , of course , remains the issue that whether all solutions can be expressed in terms of these parametrizations .",
    "it turns out that if one uses the double - layer parametrization for interior wave functions , and the single - layer parametrization for exterior wave functions then _ any _ solution can be thus parametrized .",
    "the converse problem ( i.e.  parametrizing interior wave functions using double layers and exterior wave functions using single layers ) is also possible , provided certain supplementary conditions are satisfied ; see , e.g. , refs .",

    "one might also consider disconnected normal regions connected by superconducting regions , and thus address the issue of single - particle tunneling between them .",
    "the utility of these parametrizations is that they can be used to transform partial differential equations in @xmath35 or @xmath36 into fredholm integral equations that reside on @xmath34 , and as we shall see in the following section , such integral equations prove useful in some cases , especially if the integral equation is of the second type , i.e. , if an iterative solution is possible .",
    "we now turn to the second ingredient needed for the construction of a mse , viz . , _",
    "jump conditions_. it is an important result of potential theory that the parametrization of wave functions in terms of single and double layers , such as those given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spb],[eq : spa ] ) , leads to representations of wave functions that behave in a singular fashion for field points @xmath12 on the surface @xmath34 .",
    "it is precisely this singular behavior , and the attendant jump conditions , that are responsible for the utility of these parametrizations and , as we shall see shortly , lead to the formulation of integral equations for the layer strengths , single or double , known as _ boundary integral equations_. these equations incorporate what ever boundary conditions one wishes to impose on the wave function . by solving boundary integral equations",
    "one arrives at layer strengths that parametrize the wave functions .",
    "there are three virtues to this boundary integral equations formulation .",
    "first , the boundary integral equations reside solely on the boundary @xmath34 ( i.e.  on a manifold of dimension one fewer than the original wave equation ) . from the computational standpoint it is economical to formulate a problem in terms of functions that reside on lower - dimensional manifolds ( and",
    "hence depend on fewer variables ) .",
    "second , from the theoretical standpoint , existence theorems have been established for broad classes of integral equations , often encompassing the boundary integral equations that emerge from specific examples .",
    "( in fact , it was the goal of establishing exitence theorems for solutions to the laplace equation in various settings  interior or exterior , dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions  that inspired fredholm to develop the boundary intergal equation approach to potential theory , and subsequently to develop the theory of what we now know as fredholm integral equations . )  and third , from the physical standpoint , boundary integral equations and their iterative solution allow one to organize the computation of wave functions in terms of the multiple scattering of waves from interfaces that separate spatially homogeneous regions , along with free propagation between those scattering events .",
    "thus , one is in a position to focus on the boundary scattering events , and thereby to focus on the geometry of the boundary and the implications of its shape for the physical problem at hand .",
    "in essence , we are invoking the piecewise homogeneity of the system to integrate up  our description of it , leaving us with the need to consider one fewer independent variable . as a result of this integrating up ,  we depart from a purely local description , in terms of differential equations , and arrive at a nonlocal formulation in terms of integral equations .",
    "consider the single - layer parametrization for helmholtz wave functions in the region @xmath36 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spb ] ) .",
    "now , it is known from potential theory that this parametrization is singular as @xmath12 goes to any value @xmath363 on the boundary ( see app .  [",

[ sec : mre ] that periodic orbits that include such paths do not contribute at leading order to the semiclassical dos oscillations .        in order to bring to the fore the physics underlying these cancellations ,",
    "consider a much simpler case : the mre for the helmholtz green function satisfying homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions  @xcite . by applying the methods described here",
    ", one can express this green function in terms of the following mre : @xmath768 where @xmath701 is the homogeneous helmholtz green function .",
    "if the domain @xmath35 over which @xmath769 is defined is nonconvex then one may be concerned by the presence of amplitudes involving propagations between pairs of boundary points for which all or part of this propagation lies outside of @xmath35 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nonconvex ] ) . on physical grounds ,",
    "one expects that in the large @xmath770 limit the obstacle between these points would suppress such amplitudes .",
    "balian and bloch showed that this is indeed the case . to see this , we follow balian and bloch and consider @xmath769 for a planar boundary .",
    "then the mre  ( [ eq : helmholtz_mre ] ) terminates at the second term : @xmath771 on the other hand , by using the method of images one has @xmath772 where @xmath773 is the mirror image of @xmath774 with respect to the planar boundary .",
    "comparison of eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz_planar2 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz_planar1 ] ) produces the relation @xmath775 as the length @xmath776 equals the length @xmath777 , one can replace @xmath774 by @xmath773 in relation  ( [ eq : cancel1 ] ) and obtain a second relation @xmath778 now suppose @xmath34 is not planar .",
    "although relations  ( [ eq : cancel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cancel2 ] ) no longer hold , in the large @xmath770 limit the dominant contribution comes from the stationary - phase point and , thus , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancel2 ] ) becomes exact as @xmath770 tends to infinity .",
    "that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancel1 ] ) is not exact in this limit is due to the fact that the fluctuation determinant in this case ( viz .",
    "when @xmath12 and @xmath774 are on the same side of the surface ) depends on the curvature of the surface at the stationary - phase point .",
    "now let us return to what happens for nonconvex surfaces .",
    "in particular , consider a term in mre in which part of the amplitude has propagation between boundary points @xmath151 and @xmath249 , where part of the line joining @xmath151 and @xmath249 lies outside @xmath35 and intersects @xmath34 at the points @xmath779 and @xmath780 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nonconvex ] ) . in relation to this term , consider three related terms with higher numbers of reflections : ( i )  the term with one more reflection near @xmath779 , ( ii )  the term with one more reflection near @xmath780 , and ( iii )  the term with two more reflections near @xmath779 and @xmath780 . in the mre , all four are in the sum .",
    "the sum of the part of the amplitude involving direct propagation from @xmath151 to @xmath249 and the one with one more reflection near @xmath779 is @xmath781 by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancel2 ] ) this sum vanishes in the @xmath782 limit .",
    "the same holds for the sum of remaining two terms .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath782 sum of all terms involving paths that lie partially outside of @xmath35 vanishes .",
    "these considerations extend readily to andreev billiards . in order to see this",
    ", we must extend the identity  ( [ eq : cancel2 ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved as follows : @xmath783 where , as in the case of helmholtz green functions , @xmath34 is a planar surface and @xmath12 and @xmath784 lie on different sides of @xmath34 , and in going to the second line we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancel2 ] ) .",
    "a similar identity holds for @xmath176 @xmath785 this identity can be obtained by performing the matrix multiplication and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancel2 ] ) in each matrix element .",
    "as in the case of helmholtz green functions , identities  ( [ eq : cancel_n ] ) and ( [ eq : cancel_s ] ) hold in the large @xmath434 limit , even if @xmath34 is not planar . as we did for the helmholtz case , consider a term in mse in which part of the amplitude has propagation between boundary points @xmath151 and @xmath249 , where part of the line joining @xmath151 and @xmath249 lies outside @xmath35 and intersects @xmath34 at the points @xmath779 and @xmath780 .",
    "however , now we have additional terms owing to the possibility of propagation between any two boundary points involving either @xmath80 or @xmath176 . by using the identities  ( [ eq : cancel_n ] ) and  ( [ eq : cancel_s ] ) it is not hard to see that , in the large @xmath434 limit , a propagation from @xmath151 to @xmath249",
    "is not cancelled only if the line joining these points lies totally in either @xmath35 or @xmath36 , with the propagation involving the homogeneous green function appropriate to the corresponding region .",
    "thus , in the semiclassical limit the terms that survive in the mse consist of pure reflection or pure transmission / tunneling . for the example at hand , the surviving term would be the one with normal propagation from @xmath151 to @xmath269 , superconducting propagation from @xmath269 to @xmath786 ( i.e.  tunneling ) , and then normal propagation from @xmath786 to @xmath249 .",
