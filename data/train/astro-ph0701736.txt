    "x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) are similar to gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , but with most of the fluence of the prompt emission detected in the x - ray band .",
    "their existence as a class was suggested by @xcite based on data from the bepposax satellite .",
    "the high energy spectra ( @xmath17 ) of the prompt emission from grbs are well described by the so - called band function @xcite , which is composed of two smoothly connected power - laws .",
    "the energy at which the two power - laws connect , @xmath18 , is where most of the energy is emitted . for classical grbs ,",
    "@xmath18 is typically a few 100  kev @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the prompt emission of xrfs are also well fitted by the band function , but with values of @xmath18 below @xmath19  kev and in some cases even below 10  kev @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue , in accordance with previous studies , that the spectral distributions of xrfs , x - ray rich grbs and grbs form a continuum , suggesting that they all arise from the same phenomenon ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". there has also been growing evidence that ( at least some ) xrfs are the result of classical grbs seen off - axis @xcite .",
    "other suggestions include xrfs as either dirty fireballs , which are relativistic jets with a larger baryon load and hence ( assuming external shocks ) lower @xmath20-factors than those of classical grbs @xcite , or xrfs as clean fireballs where ( assuming internal shocks ) the spread in @xmath20-factors is small but the average @xmath20-factor is large @xcite .    however , there are still open questions regarding the origin of xrfs .",
    "while the connection between long grbs and certain core - collapse supernovae appears to be well established @xcite , the case has not been as well defined for xrfs .",
    "@xcite performed the first comprehensive observational campaign of an xrf optical afterglow , for xrf030723 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the well sampled lightcurve for xrf030723 displayed several interesting features :    \\(i ) the very early lightcurve was essentially flat , in accordance with models for which xrfs are viewed away from the jet axis .",
    "\\(ii ) the following power - law decay was very similar to that seen in typical grbs , suggesting a common origin .",
    "\\(iii ) at @xmath21 days past burst a strong bump in the lightcurve suggested the presence of a fast rising supernova .",
    "the supernova interpretation was argued to be consistent with the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) evolution @xcite and was later supported by modeling both of the afterglow @xcite and of the supernova @xcite .",
    "more evidence has now been presented arguing for a common origin for grbs and xrfs .",
    "xrf020903 had a late lightcurve and spectrum consistent with a supernova at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the nearby ( @xmath23 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and unusual burst , xrf060218 , with a very low @xmath24  kev @xcite showed unambiguous evidence for an associated supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn2006aj associated with xrf060218 clearly established the close link between sne , ( grbs ) and xrfs .",
    "however , other xrfs with late time coverage did apparently not show any clear evidence for a supernova bump @xcite .",
    "this could point to a difference in the origin of xrfs and the long grbs with accompanying sne ( but see the recent paper by * ? ? ? * for grbs with no associated supernova emission ) , although any such claim has to await observations of xrfs with a better determined distance scale .",
    "most of the xrfs claimed to lack sne in the above - mentioned studies had no measured redshifts .",
    "we here present data for xrf050824 for which we have obtained a well monitored optical lightcurve and a secure spectroscopic redshift .",
    "xrf050824 was detected by the bat instrument on - board the swift satellite @xcite on august 24.9669 2005 ut ( universal time is used throughout the article ) .",
    "the burst duration ( t@xmath25 ) was 25  s , i.e. , this was a long - duration burst .",
    "the total fluence in the 15150  kev band was @xmath262.3@xmath2710@xmath28 ergs @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "@xcite estimated @xmath33  kev .",
    "grb050824 is thus clearly an xrf .",
    "the bat on - board localization was reported to an accuracy of 3 arcminutes .",

    "* ) in southern spain , which detected the burst from 10.6 minutes after the high energy event in several @xmath0-band exposures",
