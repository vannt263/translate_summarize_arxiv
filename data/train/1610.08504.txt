    "in the past two decades , tight correlations have been discovered between supermassive black hole mass ( ) and the properties of the host galaxy , including luminosity ( ) , stellar mass ( ) and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath3 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these tight correlations are usually considered to be the result of physical coupling between supermassive bh growth and galaxy evolution ( see , however , * ? ? ? * for a different view ) .",
    "the origin of this co - evolution is still an open question , central for our understanding of the role of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one key to study this coupling is to trace the correlations to higher redshift , determining how and when they emerged and evolved ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    unfortunately , there are challenges in mapping these correlations beyond the local universe ( i.e. redshift @xmath4 ) . at",
    "cosmologically significant look - back times , the sphere of influence of the black hole can not be directly resolved , forcing one to study active black holes , where  can be estimated indirectly using the properties of the broad emission lines ( see recent reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * )",
    ". however , the presence of a bright point source makes it very hard to study the properties of the host galaxy , which is typically barely resolved and faint owing to cosmological surface brightness dimming . for these reasons , much attention so far has been devoted to relatively faint agn ( seyfert 1s ) where the brightness of the point source is comparable to that of the host @xcite , and very little is known about the hosts of the most luminous agns , hosting the most massive black holes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a few exceptions ) .",
    "strong gravitational lensing ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) provides a unique opportunity to make progress in the study of the luminosity of the host galaxies of the most luminous agn in the distant universe .",
    "even with lensing magnification , the agn is unresolved at _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) resolution , while the host galaxy is typically well resolved .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first studied the -  relation using gravitational lensed agn image out to redshift @xmath5 , finding that host galaxies were typically underluminous compared to the local universe , when taking the evolution of stellar populations into account , provided that systematic uncertainties can be controlled .",
    "given the advances in both the quality of the data and lensing modelling techniques in the past decade , it is time to revisit this measurement . in this paper",
    "we present extensive and realistic simulations of ultradeep  images of lensed agns obtained with the goal of measuring cosmological parameters from gravitational time delays .",
    "we then analyze the simulated images with the state of the art code as if they were real images , in order to quantify realistic uncertainties and uncover biases and systematic errors associated with the measurement of the lensed host galaxy luminosity .",
    "the data analyzed here represent a dramatic improvement over the nicmos data used a decade ago : not only is wfc3-ir at least a factor of 10 faster ( in terms of time required to reach a certain depth ) , but our exposure times are typically 5@xmath210 longer for each object .",
    "likewise ,  has several advantages with respect to the lensing code used by @xcite .",
    "first , the host galaxy is not assumed to have a regular surface brightness profile , but is modelled as a grid of surface brightness pixels obtained through regularized linear inversion .",
    "thus , it has the flexibility to describe the complex morphologies observed in some cases @xcite .",
    "this allows the observer to choose the most appropriate parametrized form to describe the surface brightness distribution of each specific system .",
    "second , the deflector mass distribution can be described with models that are more flexible than singular isothermal ellipsoid thus eliminating a potential source of bias in the host galaxy luminosity measurement ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to quantifying bias and uncertainties for each system in our sample , we study trends with lensing configuration , host galaxy brightness and host galaxy to agn contrast , which should be general enough to provide guidance for future studies .",
    "we note that the estimates are considered to be uncertain at the @xmath1 dex level even in the local universe @xcite .",
    "thus , the natural goal of this simulation exercise is to find out whether the random error and bias on  can be constrained or corrected to a level that is smaller than 1.25 magnitudes . in a future paper",
    "we will apply the results of our simulations to the actual data and combine them with spectroscopy to construct the -  relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly summarize the properties of the data set in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we describe our simulation pipeline in section  [ sec : sim ] . in section",
    "[ sec : rest ] we present our main results . discussion and summary are presented in section  [ sec : disc ] and  [ sec : sum ] , respectively .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "the simulations are intended to reproduce as closely as possible the deep  observations available for a sample of eight lenses currently being analyzed by our team .",
    "more information and references for each system are given in table  [ data_set ] .",
    "the real data are taken from three  programs and are described in detail elsewhere .",
    "briefly , the data for rxj1131 were obtained as part of program ( go-9744 ; pi : kochanek ) and , together with data for three lenses from program -go-12889 ( pi : suyu ) , they form the bulk of the @xmath6 lenses in cosmograil s wellspring ( h0licow ) sample .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a description of these data .",
    "four systems have been imaged in cycle 23 as part of program -go-14254 ( pi : treu ) .",
    "the cycle 23 sample was selected to have measured time delays from the cosmograil collaboration @xcite , confirmed to have extended host galaxy features in near infrared adaptive optics images taken at the keck telescope ( pi : treu ) @xcite , before being imaged with @xmath7 .",
    "more details on these observations will be given by agnello et al .",
    "( 2017 , in preparation ) .",
    "we note that we do not consider the system b1608 + 656 in this work even though it is an integral part of the h0licow sample .",
    "that system is different from the other eight considered here in that the lensed source does not host a bright agn , but it is rather an active nucleus without broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "therefore broad line based  estimates can not be obtained for this system .",
    "note:@xmath2 for conciseness , we abbreviate each lens name to four digits ( e.g he0435@xmath21223 to he0435 ) .",

    "the purpose of this section is to describe simulations of lens systems that have similar host luminosity and lensing parameters to the real data .",
    "conceptually , the following steps need to be taken in order to carry out a realistic simulation of strongly lensed agn .    1 .",
    "compute high resolution simulated images of the lensed agn , host , and deflector light .",
    "2 .   convolve with the telescope point spread function ( psf ) and sample according to the pixel size of the camera .",
    "3 .   rebin the high resolution image to the actual data resolution .",
    "4 .   add noise .",
    "repeat steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) at different positions to simulate dithering and drizzle the individual images to recover some of the resolution lost to undersampling as is done with the real observations .",
    "this step introduces correlated noise .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we describe these steps in detail , referring to the specific case of he0435@xmath21223 as an example , when necessary .",
    "more details about this system are available in five papers detailing the cosmographic analysis @xcite .",
    "we start by generating a high resolution psf using tiny tim . in practice , tiny tim will not yield a sufficiently good model of the psf for our application .",
    "however , for the purpose of this simulation exercise we assume that we know the psf , and that the details of its shape are irrelevant as long as they possess a sufficiently realistic description of -quality psf profiles .",
    "we have developed an iterative psf modelling process which can accurately recover the psf for real  observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* suyu et al .  in preparation ) . this iterative process will be used when analyzing the real lens systems , and the residual uncertainties taken into account when measuring the host galaxy luminosity .",
    "an alternative scheme for modelling the psf in ground based data is described by @xcite and applied to adaptive optics observations of gravitationally lensed agns from sdss quasar lens search ( sqls ) .    in the case of he0435 ,",
    "the high resolution psf was oversampled by a linear factor of 4 , i.e. using a pixel size of @xmath8 in steps ( i ) and ( ii ) listed above .",
    "the same factor for pixel size is used for the other lenses imaged with wfc3-ir except for he1104 , for which we used @xmath9 , in order to simulate the actual dither pattern used during the observations ( see section  [ ssec : dither ] for details ) .",
    "once the psf is generated , we simulate the lensing system itself .",
    "the surface brightness is described as a hybrid model @xcite comprised of @xmath10 point sources for the lensed agn in the image plane , @xmath11 a simply - parametrized model for the deflector surface brightness in the image plane , and @xmath12 a simply - parametrized model for the host galaxy in the source plane .    for simplicity , in this study",
    "we adopt a single @xcite profile to describe the surface brightness profile of the host ( step ( i ) ) and of the deflector .",
    "this srsic profile is commonly used in the literature and provides a reasonably accurate description of the surface brightness of galaxies , ranging from exponential disks to @xcite profiles . in future papers , when analyzing real systems , we will examine the pixellated reconstructed surface brightness profile of each host galaxy and identify the most appropriate parametrization .",
    "likewise we will adopt different ( or multiple ) surface brightness profiles to describe the deflector light , if warranted by the data as in the case of rxj1131 @xcite .",
    "we note that choosing a simply - parametrized description of the surface brightness pixels is necessary in order to obtain results directly comparable with the rest of the literature and also to extrapolate the observed flux to an infinite aperture , as it is common practice ( the extrapolation is typically several tens of percent in total luminosity , as the reconstructed source image does not extend much further than the effective radius ) .",
    "the @xcite profile is parametrized as follows : @xmath13 , \\\\     & r(x , y , q ) = \\sqrt{qx^2+y^2/q}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath14 is the pixel surface brightness at the effective radius .",
    "the srsic index @xmath15 controls the shape of the radial surface brightness profile ; a larger @xmath15 corresponds to a steeper inner profile and a highly extended outer wing .",
    "the constant @xmath16 depends on @xmath15 so as to ensure that the isophote at @xmath17 encloses half of the total light , i.e. that @xmath18 is the half - light radius @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath19 denotes the axis ratio .",
    "the deflector mass density profile is described by a class of elliptical power - law models .",
    "the surface mass density is parametrized as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _",
    "critical density _ , depending on the angular diameter distances to the deflector ( @xmath22 ) , to the source ( @xmath23 ) and between the deflector and the source ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the einstein radius @xmath25 is chosen such that , in the spherical limit ( @xmath26 ) , it encloses a mean surface density equal to @xmath27 this is also the radius of a ring traced by the host of the agn when this is exactly aligned with the lens galaxy .",
    "the exponent @xmath28 is the so - called slope of the mass density profile , @xmath29 for massive elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the projected axis ratio of the mass density profile is described by @xmath30 .",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews by @xcite for more details .",
    "having specified the intrinsic surface brightness of the host galaxy and the mass model of the deflector , the lensed images can be computed by solving the lens equation . in practice , this is done using the code pylens written by one of us ( m.w.a . ) and functionally tested extensively by @xcite .    in order to create simulations that are as realistic as possible ,",
    "we first obtained rough models of the real systems .",
    "this set of rough models enables us to set realistic values and ranges ( see table  [ para_config ] and section [ sec : rest ] as for details ) to the input parameters needed for pylens simulations of the host galaxy and deflector surface brightness .",
    "the agn images are added directly in the image plane as psfs scaled to match the observed flux .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_pipe ] , panels @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    ".      the  psf is undersampled by the camera setups that we simulate in this study .",
    "therefore , a common strategy consists of dithering the observations by non - integer number of pixels in order to recover some of the information lost via a process known as drizzling .    in order to simulate the undersampling and dithering",
    ", we bin the high resolution image ( @xmath33 for he0345 as an example ) , varying the location of the binning grid so as to mimic the actual dithering pattern adopted in the  observations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sim_pipe]-(c ) , [ fig : binpix ] for an illustration ) .",

    "we carried out extensive and realistic simulations of lensed agn images taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ , in order to study the fidelity of agn host galaxy reconstruction using state of the art data and lens reconstruction software .",
    "we simulated eight lensed agn systems ( see table [ data_set ] for detailed information ) , with 48 sets of parameters each covering the plausible physical range for the host galaxy and lens galaxy properties .",
    "reproducing as closely as possible the analysis procedure of real data , we inferred the magnitude of the agn host galaxy and compared it to the input value .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .",
    "systematic errors in the reconstructed host galaxy luminosity are typically larger than random errors",
    ". however , the level of systematic errors and biases are smaller than the uncertainty of single epoch  estimates ( @xmath1 dex , i.e. 1.25 mag ) .",
    "in fact , for brighter host arc images ( @xmath34 in the image plane ) the level of bias and systematic error is significantly smaller ( within @xmath35 mag ) .",
    "2 .   the magnitude bias depends on both the magnitude of the host arc , and the contrast between the host arc and the agn , as expected .",
    "3 .   the magnitude bias does not depend on the srsic index of the host ; there is no significant difference between different srsic index ( i.e. 2 and 4 ) inputs , in the range that may be expected for bright agn hosts .",
    "the quadruply imaged systems tend to have smaller bias than the doubles , consistent with their larger magnification and larger amount of available information .",
    "5 .   for the fainter host galaxies ( f160w@xmath36 mag in the image plane ) systematic errors and bias can be larger than 1.25 magnitudes .",
    "such cases may be difficult to analyze without introducing informative priors to constrain the shape and size of the surface brightness profile .",
    "we conclude that by using state of the art data and analysis tools the magnitudes of lensed agn host galaxies can be studied with uncertainties that are smaller than those stemming from single epoch black hole mass estimates .",
