    "as the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe , clusters of galaxies offer unique constraints on the formation of large scale structure : models of galaxy infall onto clusters predict the velocity distributions of the infalling galaxies in terms of the density enhancement of the cluster and the cosmological mass density @xmath14 @xcite . on smaller scales ,",
    "clusters also provide important clues for theories of galaxy formation and evolution : the broader distribution of late - type ( star - forming ) galaxies compared to early - types in both poor clusters ( e.g.  virgo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and rich clusters ( e.g.  coma , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is generally interpreted as evidence that the late - type galaxies are falling into the clusters for the first time , whereas the early types are an older , virialized population .",
    "these observations are based on luminous cluster galaxies ( @xmath15 ) , even though they are greatly outnumbered by dwarf galaxies .",
    "studies of the dwarf populations are limited to small samples in nearby clusters and groups , such as the fornax cluster @xcite and the sculptor and centaurus  a groups @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the dwarfs had more extended velocity and spatial distributions than the giants , but not at statistically significant levels .",
    "it is timely to investigate the behavior of dwarfs in clusters using larger samples , as numerical simulations of cluster formation can now resolve the formation of dark matter halos the size of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we present a dynamical study of the fornax cluster , a nearby poor , but relatively dense cluster .",
    "our sample includes a significant number of dwarf galaxies which form a distinct population kinematically .",
    "we find strong evidence that fornax has a distinct subcluster containing a high concentration of star - forming galaxies . for our analysis",
    "we adopt a cluster distance of 20  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see discussion below ) .",
    "our analysis is based on a large study @xcite of the fornax cluster made with the flair - ii spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) .",
    "we obtained redshifts for 516 galaxies with @xmath16 in a @xmath17  field centered on the fornax cluster .",
    "most of the the targets ( 426 or @xmath18 of all galaxies in the field with @xmath19 ) were compact galaxies ( scale lengths @xmath20 arcseconds ) selected from a digitized ukst plate to search for new compact cluster members .",
    "the spectra have a resolution of 13  ( velocity uncertainty @xmath21 ) .",
    "eighteen were confirmed as cluster members , nine being new compact cluster dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we also obtained 5.3  resolution spectra ( @xmath22 ) for a sample of 90 galaxies listed as probable cluster members in the fornax cluster catalog ( * ? ? ? * fcc ) ; this is 54% of the fcc members with @xmath23 .",
    "all 90 were confirmed as cluster members , giving a total sample of 108 .",
    "the 53 galaxies with @xmath24 ( @xmath15 ) we classify as giants and the remainder ( 55 ) as dwarfs .",
    "we also spectroscopically classify each galaxy as late - type or early - type ; the 42 galaxies with h@xmath2 emission equivalent width greater than 1  ( a 3@xmath25 detection ) were classified as late and the remainder ( 66 ) as early . of the 43 dwarf galaxies with early - type morphological classifications in the fcc , 11 had enough @xmath26 emission to be reclassified by this criterion , so that @xmath3 of the dwarfs are spectroscopic late - types compared to 18%  based on morphological classifications .",
    "the implications of this observation on the evolution of star formation in dwarf galaxies are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the fornax cluster has previously been noted for its relatively smooth gaussian velocity distribution @xcite . using the w test on our data for fornax",
    "we find that the total sample of 108 galaxies has a velocity distribution that is marginally non - gaussian ( at the 91% confidence level ) , but the late / early and giant / dwarf subsamples are all consistent with gaussians at the 2-@xmath25 level ( fig .",
    "[ fig_distribution]a , b ) .",
    "the total sample has a mean velocity of @xmath4 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath5 , in agreement with other work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "using the t- and f - tests , we find no significant differences in the mean velocities of the different subsamples or the velocity dispersions of the early ( @xmath27 ) and late type samples ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "there is , however , a significant difference ( at the 98%  level ) in the velocity dispersions of the dwarfs ( @xmath6 ) and the giants ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this was suspected by @xcite , but their sample was too small for a significant result .",
    "we discuss the implications of this observation in section  [ sec_discussion ] below .",
    "we applied the `` @xmath29-test '' of @xcite to the total sample to test for velocity substructure .",
    "this test takes groups of the @xmath30 nearest neighbors to each galaxy and compares the velocity distribution of the group to that of the whole cluster .",
    "the test revealed substructure for the @xmath31 case at the 96%  significance level , notably for a group to the southwest of the cluster center .",
    "[ fig_velocity ] shows an adaptively - smoothed projection of the galaxy number density onto a plane of velocity against distance along a diagonal vector running through the cluster center from south west to north east , chosen to isolate the group in the sw corner of the cluster .",
    "we used the kmm mixture modeling algorithm to locate the substructure .",
    "this algorithm searches for the maximum - likelihood partition of a cluster into a specified number of subclusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we used a coordinate system based on offsets in projected separation on the sky measured in arc minutes from the position of ngc  1399 ( @xmath3203:38:29.0 @xmath3335:27:01 j2000 ) .",
    "the kmm analysis identified a very robust partition of the sample into a 92-member cluster ( `` fornax - main '' ) centered at ( @xmath34 ) , with @xmath35 and a 16-member subcluster ( `` fornax - sw '' ) at ( @xmath36 ) with @xmath37 .",
    "fornax - main is centered near ngc  1399 while fornax - sw is dominated by ngc  1316 ( fornax  a ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_subcluster ] .",
    "the estimated correct allocation rate was 99%  and the partition was preferred over a single distribution at the 99%  confidence level .",
    "a further partition of fornax - main identified a high - velocity clump ( including the probably infalling ngc  1404 and associated objects , see below ) projected on the cluster center , but this partition was not significantly better than a single distribution .    the radial distribution of the 92 galaxies in the fornax - main cluster alone is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_distribution](c , d ) . even on removing the spiral - rich fornax - sw subcluster ,",
    "the remaining 29 late - type galaxies are much more extended than the 63 early - types ( at a ks significance level of 99% ) .",
    "in addition , the fornax - main sample is no longer well - described by a king profile @xcite , excluded at a ks significance level of 90% .",
    "comparison of the dwarf and giant distributions in fornax - main ( fig .",
    "[ fig_distribution](d ) ) shows that the dwarfs are more spatially extended at a ks significance level of 94% .",
    "the distributions of galaxy velocities against projected radius from cluster centers are predicted to exhibit caustic structures due to the overlapping of shells of infalling galaxies @xcite but this has previously been detected only in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "we plot this distribution for fornax in fig .",
    "[ fig_caustic ] .",
    "a caustic - like structure is strongly suggested when we consider just the early - type galaxies ( circles ) . if real , this is the first detection of caustic structure in such a poor cluster , but the numbers of galaxies are too low to accurately determine the location of the caustics . for comparison",
    "we plot one caustic curve for a model @xcite with @xmath38 and a turn - around radius of 2.4 , corresponding to a cluster mass of @xmath39 and a virial radius of 0.7 .",
    "although the caustics are not well - defined , we can use the method of @xcite to measure the cluster mass as it provides a robust estimate without making assumptions of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "briefly , the method works by defining caustic - like curves of the velocity amplitude @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_caustic ] .",
    "the amplitude is defined by the points where the galaxy density falls below a threshold @xmath29 , defined to minimize the difference between the escape velocities calculated from @xmath40 and estimated from the central velocity dispersion . the amplitude profile is then integrated to yield the mass profile @xmath41 , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_caustic ] . at small radii",
    "the resulting mass profile agrees well with independent estimates from x - ray measurements at the center of the cluster .",
    "the total enclosed mass at a radius of 1.4  is @xmath12 .",
    "integrating the blue light from all galaxies out to the same radius we get @xmath42 and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath43 @xmath44 , in the normal range for clusters @xcite . limiting the analysis to the 92 galaxies of the main subcluster we obtain a slightly smaller mass of @xmath45 .",
    "we also estimated the cluster mass by applying the virial theorem to the early - type galaxies alone ( fig .",
    "[ fig_caustic ] ) .",
    "we used the mean of the projected - mass estimators for radial and isotropic orbits ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , the projected mass estimator based on the early - type galaxies alone converges to a mass of @xmath39 consistent with that found using the @xcite method applied to all galaxies in the cluster .",
    "we also applied the virial ( projected mass ) estimator to the sw subcluster , obtaining a mass of @xmath46 , but this is an upper limit as this subcluster is presumably not virialized . alternatively ,",
    "if it had the same mass - to - light ratio as the main cluster , its mass would be @xmath47 .",
    "as the difference in velocity dispersions between the dwarfs ( @xmath6 ) and the giants ( @xmath7 ) is consistent with the expected ratio of @xmath48:1 for infalling and virialized populations @xcite , we conclude that the dwarf population is dominated by infalling objects whereas the giants are virialized .",
    "the more extended spatial distribution of the dwarfs supports this conclusion .",
    "this is the first detection of such separation of cluster components by mass , and it is not consistent with numerical simulations of cluster formation which do not show any mass segregation in the velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that dynamical relaxation ( e.g.  by dynamical friction of the massive galaxies ) could have caused the mass segregation .",
    "the timescale for this is @xmath49 gyr for the fornax cluster . even assuming the dwarfs are only 5 times less massive than the giants ( for a mass - to - light ratio ten times that of the giants )",
    ", relaxation would give a dwarf velocity dispersion @xmath50 times that of the giants .",
    "we can not rule out partial relaxation giving the observed ratio , but this requires fine tuning of the mass segregation compared to the picture of infalling / virialized samples which naturally predicts the @xmath48:1 ratio observed here and in the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "the fornax - sw subcluster has a recession velocity @xmath51 greater than the fornax - main cluster .",
    "we attempted to constrain the physical motion of the subcluster using a two - body model as in @xcite .",
    "the small relative motion of the two components gave a range of possible solutions , both incoming and outgoing .",
    "all the solutions were bound . assuming all projection angles are equally probable , the most likely solutions have fornax - sw infalling at velocities of 100500  at radii of 3.51.1 .",
    "an infalling solution is supported by individual galaxy properties : fornax - sw is a site of intense star formation , containing 15% of all galaxies in the total fornax sample , but 31% of the star - forming galaxies .",
    "this subcluster contains two of the four cluster galaxies with exceptionally high star - formation rates , ngc  1341 and fcc  33 ( figs .",
    "[ fig_velocity ] and [ fig_subcluster ] ) and a large amount of neutral hydrogen @xcite , unlikely to have survived a passage through the cluster core .",
    "furthermore , observations of fornax  a in the subcluster @xcite indicate that it has a projected velocity of approximately 80  northwards , consistent with infall . similarly , the subgroup seen in projection on the cluster core ( seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_velocity ] at 450 ) is probably real and infalling , although it was not robustly identified by the kmm algorithm .",
    "this group contains ngc  1404 , which has a distorted x - ray envelope indicative of infall @xcite , and the irregular galaxy ngc 1427a , which shows signs of being disrupted by its first passage through the cluster @xcite .",
    "the morphologies of both these galaxies are indicative of material blown off behind them as they move towards the cluster center .",
    "the substructure that we have identified in fornax bears on the determination of its cepheid distance .",
    "there are now three cepheid distances to spirals in the fornax region : ngc  1365 at 18.6  @xcite , ngc  1326a at 18.7  @xcite , and ngc  1425 at 22.2  @xcite .",
    "mould et al .",
    "suggest that the mean of these ( @xmath52 ) be adopted , but this may still not yield an accurate cluster distance . though seen in projection only 70  ( @xmath53 ) from the cluster core and with a similar velocity , ngc  1365 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_velocity ] ) may be situated near the turn - around radius ( @xmath542  out or @xmath5410% in distance ) , given the tendency of late - type galaxies to avoid the cluster core .",
    "if ngc  1365 were in the cluster core , it might be expected to show morphological peculiarities like spirals in virgo , coma , and other clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is symmetric at wavelengths from optical to 20cm@xcite . with an identical cepheid distance , and as a member of the infalling fornax - sw subgroup ( fig .",
    "[ fig_subcluster ] ) , ngc  1326a is also a doubtful indicator of the distance to the fornax core .",
    "ngc  1425 is perhaps a better gauge of the cluster distance , but it is 56 ( @xmath55 ) or @xmath56 core radii removed from the cluster center ; it is not even clear whether ngc  1425 belongs to fornax or the nearby eridanus cluster ( mould et al . ) .",
    "while a simpler system than the virgo cluster , fornax nevertheless presents its own difficulties for an accurate distance measurement using cepheids ; a secure result awaits observations of additional spirals unambiguously residing in the cluster core .",
