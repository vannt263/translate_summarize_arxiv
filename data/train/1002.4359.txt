    "two important developments have rekindled interest in the phenomena of even - denominator incompressible fractional quantum hall states in two - dimensional high - mobility bilayer semiconductor structures .",
    "the first is the recent intriguing experimental observation by luhman _",
    "et al_.  @xcite of two distinct even - denominator fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) states at filling factors @xmath0 and 1/4 in a very wide ( @xmath1 ) single quantum well ( wide - quantum - well ) structure at very high ( @xmath2 ) magnetic fields .",
    "the second development , motivated by implications for fault - tolerant topological quantum computation  @xcite , is the great deal of recent theoretical and experimental interest in the possible non - abelian nature of the @xmath3 second landau level ( sll ) fqhe state first observed by willett _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in the single - layer system in 1987 with subsequent confirming observations  @xcite over the years since .",
    "the fqhe at filling factor @xmath3 presents an amazing confluence of ideas from condensed matter physics , conformal field theory , topology , and quantum computation .",
    "@xcite in particular , the fundamental nature of the experimentally observed 5/2 fqhe , whether an exotic spin - polarized non - abelian incompressible paired state or a more common abelian incompressible paired state , has remained an enigma for more than 20 years .",
    "although theoretical and numerical work indicates that the 5/2 fqhe belongs to a non - abelian moore - read pfaffian  @xcite universality class , there is scant experimental evidence supporting this conclusion  @xcite ( see ref .   for a comprehensive review of non - abelian physics and topological quantum computation ) .",
    "these two developments lead to important and interesting questions .",
    "one question is whether a non - abelian @xmath0 fqhe , i.e. , the analog of the possibly non - abelian @xmath4 sll single - layer state  @xcite , can exist in the lowest landau level ( lll ) under experimentally observable conditions .",
    "this question has a long history  @xcite in the theoretical literature going back to the early 1990s and recent fqhe experiments at @xmath0 make it imperative that a theoretical analysis be carried out to achieve a proper qualitative understanding of current experiments  @xcite .",
    "another important question concerns the non - abelian - ness ( or not ) of the experimental 5/2 state which is of profound importance beyond quantum hall physics  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is useful to contemplate novel situations where the nature of the 5/2 state will manifest itself in a dramatic , but hitherto unexplored , manner .",
    "the current work addresses the dichotomy ( i.e. , the 1/2 fqhe being an abelian halperin 331 bilayer state  @xcite versus the 5/2 fqhe being a non - abelian moore - read pfaffian  @xcite single - layer state ) between single - layer sll physics versus bilayer lll physics by studying the _ bilayer _ fqhe in both the _ lowest _ and _ second _ lls as a function of layer separation and tunneling .",
    "we ask whether bilayers can support _ both _ pf and 331 fqhe .",
    "the proposed non - abelian moore - read pfaffian ( pf ) state is a weak - pairing single - layer ( or one - component ) fqhe state for half - filled lls which , in principle , applies to any orbital ll ( i.e. , lll as well as sll ) .",
    "thus , as a matter of principle a @xmath0 lll single - layer pf fqhe is certainly a possibility  @xcite although it has never been observed experimentally . theoretically , due to the differences in the electron - electron coulomb interaction pseudo - potentials in the lll compared to the sll the two situations ( i.e. , 1/2 and 5/2 ) are quantitatively very different , and it is possible for the pf fqhe to exist in the sll , but not in the lll ( and vice versa ) . the best existing numerical work  @xcite indicates that either the single - layer @xmath0 lll pf state does not exist in nature or if it exists , does so only in rather thick 2d layers with an extremely small fqhe excitation gap , making it impossible or very difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "by contrast , the single - layer @xmath3 sll fqhe is observed routinely , albeit at low temperatures ( @xmath5 ) , in high mobility ( @xmath6 ) samples , and with a rather small ( but experimentally accessible ) activation gap ( @xmath7-@xmath8 ) . in fact , it has been pointed out that the experimental @xmath3 fqhe is always among the strongest observed fqhe states in the sll .    instead of studying a single - layer 2d system , we concentrate on the spin - polarized and density balanced bilayer system assuming an arbitrary tunneling strength @xmath9 and an arbitrary layer separation @xmath10 in the lowest and second lls .",
    "we confine our study to spin - polarized systems because all experimentally realized half - filled fqhe states appear to be fully spin - polarized , consistent with the theoretical expectation  @xcite  whether bilayer two - component fqhe states at @xmath0 or one - component single - layer fqhe states at @xmath3 . by density  balanced \" we mean that each layer in the bilayer system has the same number of electrons .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the tunneling strength @xmath9 is proportional to the symmetric - antisymmetric energy gap .",
    "the experimentally realizable system we have in mind could either be a true bilayer double - quantum - well structure or a single wide - quantum - well ( wqw ) which manifests effective bilayer behavior where the self - consistent field from the electrons produces effective two - component behavior  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - bilayer - dqw - wqw ] in sec .",
    "[ sec - app ] ) .",
    "we numerically obtain the approximate quantum phase diagram for a 1/2 filled bilayer system in either the lowest or second landau level in the @xmath9-@xmath10 space using the spherical system finite size exact diagonalization ( lanczos ) technique , concentrating entirely on the pf and the 331 fqhe phases .",
    "for the lll , we revisit the @xmath0 bilayer fqhe and carry out an extensive comparison with all existing bilayer @xmath0 fqhe experimental observations to ascertain any hint of the existence of a non - abelian moore - read pfaffian state for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "no strictly single - layer system , e.g. , a heterostructure or a not - too - thick quantum well , has ever demonstrated an incompressible fqhe at @xmath0 , instead manifesting only the compressible composite fermion  @xcite fermi sea  @xcite .",
    "it is intuitive that our model system is an effective bilayer , or single - layer , @xmath0 system for small , or large , values of @xmath9 , and therefore by studying the quantum phase diagram as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath10 we hope to shed light on the possible existence of a single - layer @xmath0 fqhe in real systems .",
    "one of the results of the current work is that for the lowest landau level bilayer fqhe system , ( i ) the recently observed wqw @xmath0 fqhes  @xcite are strong - pairing abelian halperin 331 fqhe states  @xcite which , however , sit close to the boundary between the abelian 331 and the weak - pairing non - abelian pfaffian fqhe state  @xcite , and ( ii ) it may be conceivable , as a matter of principle , to realize the lll @xmath0 pfaffian non - abelian fqhe in very thick bilayers , but as a matter of practice , this is unlikely since the @xmath0 fqhe gap is extremely small ( perhaps zero ) in the parameter regime where the pf is more stable than the 331 phase .",
    "our findings about the fragility of the lll @xmath0 non - abelian pf state are consistent with recent conclusions  @xcite , but our main focus in the current work is in understanding the @xmath0 _ bilayer _ quantum phase diagram treating tunneling @xmath9 , layer separation @xmath10 , and individual layer width @xmath11 of the 2d system as independent tuning parameters of the hamiltonian .    for the second landau level , we predict that bilayers can support both the non - abelian moore - read pfaffian and the halperin abelian 331 fqhe and that there could be a novel quantum phase transition , both as a function of tunneling strength ( at constant layer separation ) and of layer separation ( at constant tunneling ) , between the two - component 331 abelian and the one - component pf non - abelian states in a bilayer sll system .",
    "we show that tuning the inter - layer tunneling and/or layer separation would lead to a transition between the abelian and the non - abelian sll fqhe , which should be observable experimentally in standard fqhe transport experiments .",
    "in particular , we predict that in realistic systems with finite single - layer width , the sll bilayer state would manifest two distinct fqhe phases separated by a region of finite inter - layer separation and tunneling .",
    "existence of two distinct incompressible fqhe bilayer states at total filling factor @xmath3 , connected possibly by a quantum phase transition , is a clear ( experimentally testable ) prediction of our theory .",
    "the observation of such a quantum phase transition , originally predicted as possible by read and green  @xcite ( fig . 1 in ref .  ) under general theoretical considerations ( but never before demonstrated to be feasible under realistic conditions ) , would strongly suggest the existence of a non - abelian 5/2 state since the two distinct fqhe phases in the same sample both can not conceivably be abelian 331 states .",
    "we first present a background for our work in section  [ sec - background ] and then describe our theoretical model in terms of a hamiltonian and introduce all relevant parameters in section  [ sec - model ] .",
    "next we revisit the lowest landau level problem in section  [ sec - lll ] _ before _ tackling the second landau level problem in section  [ sec - sll ] , since the lll problem , due to its long history , is easier to understand and will provide a proper context and atmosphere when discussing our sll results . in section  [ subsec - gap - lll ]",
    "we discuss in detail how we connect our results with current and previous experimental fqhe bilayer lll results .",
    "furthermore , in section   [ subsec - bilayer - sll ] we discuss am important issue regarding bilayer fqhe systems in higher landau levels  a difficulty or ambiguity that is quite subtle and has not been discussed previously as far as we know .",
    "lastly we present our conclusions in section  [ sec - conc ] .",
    "before describing and presenting our work , it is useful to provide a brief background of bilayer fqhe , a subject with a long history , in order to set a context for our work .",
    "the two candidate wavefunctions we consider and compare in this work , with respect to @xmath0 and 5/2 bilayer incompressible states , the halperin 331 state  @xcite and the moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite were proposed in 1983 and 1991 , respectively .",
    "the 331 wavefunction is a two - component strongly paired abelian state of two laughlin  @xcite phases in each layer whereas the pfaffian is a one - component weak pairing non - abelian superconducting state of chiral @xmath12-wave symmetry .",
    "both of these states are allowed incompressible fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) phases at half - filled landau levels which for our purpose could be either @xmath0 or 5/2(@xmath13 ) .",
    "the qualitative difference between these two incompressible fqh states is that the 331 is an abelian two - component state whereas the pfaffian is a non - abelian one - component state .",
    "it was first explicitly shown by yoshioka , girvin , and macdonald  @xcite that a bilayer system at ( total ) half - filling could support a 331 incompressible state for a layer separation @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is a characteristic length scale called the magnetic length , defined below ) , i.e. , when intra- and inter - layer correlations are comparable . later , he _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out a detailed quantitative analysis of the possible existence of 331 fqhe in @xmath0 bilayer structures , making specific predictions for layer separation ( @xmath10 ) and layer width ( @xmath11 ) values where experimentally observable incompressible states may exist .",
    "this lead to the observation of @xmath0 bilayer 331 fqhe by eisenstein _",
    "et al . _",
    "parallel to the eisenstein _",
    "_ observation of the 331 fqhe in bilayers , shayegan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed a well - defined @xmath0 fqhe in wide - quantum - wells .",
    "this wqw observation of @xmath0 fqhe was at first attributed to the one - component moore - read pfaffian state by greiter , wen , and wilczek  @xcite , who argued that the occurance of a @xmath0 fqhe in a single quantum well , rather than in double quantum wells , implies a one - component rather than two - component nature of the underlying incompressible state . later theoretical work by he _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and further experimental work by shayegan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite decisively established that the wide - well @xmath0 fqhe is , in fact , a manifestation of the two - component 331 rather than the one - component pfaffian state .",
    "the existence of a two - component 331 fqhe in wide single wells becomes possible by virtue of the self - consistent hartree electric field arising from the electrons themselves which , for sufficiently large quantum well width ( @xmath16 ) and carrier density ( @xmath17 ) , could lead to the single wide - quantum - well acting effectively as two distinct electron layers localized near the well boundaries ( with density @xmath18 each ) with a potential barrier separating them in the middle .",
    "such a two - component 331 fqhe description of observed @xmath0 incompressibility has become well - accepted , and the fact that no @xmath0 fqhe has ever been observed in relatively thin single quantum well structures or in single heterostructures has further reinforced the idea that the @xmath0 fqhe is due to the formation of the two - component halperin 331 state in wide - quantum - wells  @xcite .    from the perspective of @xmath0 fqhe , wide - quantum - wells",
    "should be considered as two - component bilayer systems with non - zero interlayer tunneling .",
    "for relatively weak , or strong , tunneling between the layers , the system behaves as a two , or one , component system , and the question of the existence of abelian 331 or non - abelian pfaffian @xmath0 fqhe then , in some sense , boils down to the existence of incompressible fqhe in the weak or strong tunneling limit .",
    "unfortunately , how strong an interlayer tunneling is strong enough to render the system into a one - component pfaffian fqhe is a quantitative question , which can only be addressed through detailed numerical study .",
    "such a numerical study is the main goal of this paper . in the process",
    ", we also ask the question of one - component versus two - component ( i.e. , pfaffian versus 331 ) fqhe in bilayer @xmath3 case , where the existence of the one - component pfaffian @xmath3 fqhe is reasonably well - established theoretically  @xcite , although actively debated  @xcite .",
    "the bilayer @xmath3 case was never studied before in the literature whereas there were only two studies of the bilayer @xmath0 case comparing 331 versus pfaffian state .",
    "the first is by he _",
    "_  @xcite and the second is by nomura and yoshioka  @xcite .",
    "our work for @xmath3 is distinct , and our work for @xmath0 transcends that of the earlier work in being much more complete .",
    "very recently , papi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated this problem using a somewhat different model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction ( sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] ) , our work is partially motivated by the recent experimental observation of luhman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite who found a @xmath0 fqhe in side single wells with relatively strong tunneling ( i.e. , large symmetric - antisymmetric energy splitting ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether the @xmath0 fqhe observed in the luhman _",
    "_ experiment is a two - component 331 state or a one - component pfaffian state .",
    "we do not study the @xmath19 fqhe observed by luhman _",
    "et al . _ which has recently been discussed by papi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite    we mention that all our theoretical work assumes complete spin - polarization of the electrons and considers only the balanced case where the average electron density is the same in each layer .",
    "we also neglect all landau level coupling effects , and as such our work does not distinguish between the non - abelian pfaffian and the non - abelian anti - pfaffian  @xcite states at @xmath0 or 5/2 .",
    "( note that the neglect of ll mixing effects may not be a particularly good assumption for the 5/2 fqhe  @xcite . )",
    "the reason for our considering full spin - polarization is that prior theoretical work by morf  @xcite and by feiguin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite indicates that the @xmath0 or 5/2 state is likely to be fully spin - polarized .",
    "if the bilayer incompressible states turn our to be unpolarized or partially polarized , our work simply would not be valid .    with this background , we study the stability of the 331 and the pfaffian state in @xmath0 and 5/2 bilayers in the presence of finite interlayer tunneling ( @xmath9 ) , interlayer separation ( @xmath10 ) , and layer width ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "our goal is to obtain an appropriate zeroth - order quantum phase diagram in the @xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath11 space for @xmath0 and 5/2 bilayer fqhe . given that we calculate and compare the exact many - body ground state for many individual values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , we are forced to use a rather modest system size for @xmath20 electrons ( i.e. , 4 in each layer ) in all our exact diagonalization work .",
    "past experience shows that a 8-electron system is quit adequate for qualitative understanding as long as precise thermodynamic values of excitation gap or ground state energy are not desired .",
    "we use the simplest model hamiltonian @xmath21 incorporating both finite tunneling @xmath9 and finite layer separation @xmath10 ( as well as finite layer width @xmath11or finite thickness ) for our bilayer fqhe system :    @xmath22 - t ( \\hat{s}_x)_\\mathrm{layer } \\ ; , \\label{eq-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the position of the @xmath25-th electron in the right and left layer , respectively . in eq .",

    "the @xmath29-component of the pseudo - spin operator @xmath30 ( written in the layer basis representation ) controls the tunneling between the two quantum wells with large @xmath9 denoting strong tunneling .",
    "note that in the bilayer problem when the electron density is balanced in each layer , i.e. , total number of particles in each layer is @xmath31 , there are essentially two natural hilbert space representations . the layer basis ( in which eq .",
    "[ eq-1 ] is written ) or the symmetric - antisymmetric basis where @xmath32 and @xmath33 destroy an electron in the symmetric ( @xmath34 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath35 ) superposition states , respectively , where @xmath36 is angular momentum and @xmath37 and @xmath38 destroy an electron in the right and left quantum well , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 can be considered to be an effective pseudo - spin index for the bilayer system . in the symmetric - antisymmetric basis ,",
    "the hamiltonian is written as @xmath40    as written above in eq .",
    "[ eq-1 ] , the intra - layer coulomb potential energy between two electrons is @xmath41 and the inter - layer potential energy is @xmath42 .",
    "a difference between the two representations is that the tunneling operator in the layer - basis can be written as @xmath30 while , in the symmetric - antisymmetric basis , the tunneling operator is @xmath43 .",
    "the layer- and symmetric - antisymmetric - bases are related through a pseudo - spin rotation .",
    "of course , the choice is a matter of personal taste and convenience and one should really appeal to a physical explanation to understand the tunneling : no matter the basis choice , the tunneling term controls the probability that electrons jump back and forth between the two layers keeping the total number of electrons in each layer fixed at @xmath31 , i.e. , keeping the bilayer system density balanced .",
    "we numerically diagonalize @xmath21 for finite @xmath44 assuming specific values of @xmath11 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 ( each expressed throughout in dimensionless units using the magnetic length @xmath45 as the length unit and the coulomb energy @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the background dielectric constant of the host semiconductor , as the energy unit ; @xmath48 is electron charge , @xmath49 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath50 is the magnetic field strength ) .",
    "we utilize the spherical geometry where the electrons are confined to a spherical surface of radius @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the total magnetic flux piercing the surface ( @xmath52 is an integer according to dirac ) , and the filling factor in the partially occupied landau level ( whether lll or sll ) is @xmath53 . to fully consider tunneling",

    "following the standard well - tested procedures  @xcite used extensively in the fqhe literature , we calculate the overlap between the exact numerical @xmath44 electron ground state wavefunction of the coulomb hamiltonian defined by eq .",

    "both @xmath60 and @xmath66 are written above in the layer representation , where the 331 state pairs electrons between layers and @xmath66 pairs electrons in a single - layer , since writing the wavefunctions in real space and appealing to the layer basis representation is much more intuitive .",
    "however , we are working within the  balanced \" density situation so the pf wavefunction , in particular , should be thought of as a wavefunction that describes pairing among electrons in the symmetric state ( ( @xmath67 ) since the electrons are never physically completely in a single layer , right or left .",

    "after diagonalizing @xmath21 we ensure that ( i ) the ground state is homogeneous , i.e. , has total orbital angular momentum @xmath71 and is therefore an incompressible state , and ( ii ) there is a gap , the fqhe excitation gap , separating the ground state from all excited states .",

    "furthermore , since the theoretical techniques are standard , we do not give the details , concentrating instead on the results and their implications for bilayer fqhe experiments .",
    "we investigate this system with the usual probes used in theoretical fqhe studies by calculating : ( i ) wavefunction overlap between variational ansatz ( @xmath66 and @xmath60 states ) and the exact ground state @xmath70 of @xmath21an overlap of unity or zero indicates that the physics is or is not described by the ansatz ; ( ii ) expectation value of the exact ground state of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the expectation values of the number of electrons in the symmetric or the antisymmetric states , respectively  a value of zero or @xmath31 indicating the ground state to be two- or one - component ; and ( iii ) energy gap ( provided the ground state is a uniform state with @xmath71)a non - zero excitation gap indicating a possible fqhe state . in other words ,",

    "we operationally define the system to be in the 331 or pf phase depending on whether the overlap between the exact ground state and the 331 or pf wavefunctions is larger , i.e. , if @xmath84 then the system is said to be in the 331 phase and vice versa .",
    "we emphasize that our work is a comparison between these two incompressible states only , and we can not comment on the possibility of some other state ( i.e. , neither 331 nor pf ) being the ground state .",
    "we do , however , believe that if the system is incompressible at a particular set of parameter values ( i.e. , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , etc . ) , it is very likely to be described by one of these two candidate states , 331 or pf .",
    "we can not , however , rule out the possibility that the real system has a compressible ground state ( without manifesting fqhe ) , e.g. , a composite fermion fermi sea , not considered in our calculation .",

    "the calculated wavefunction overlap between the exact ground state @xmath70 and the two appropriate candidate variational wavefunctions ( @xmath85 and @xmath60 ) as a function of distance @xmath10 and tunneling energy @xmath9 is shown in fig .",

    "first we focus on the situation with zero width @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - o - lll](a ) ) and concentrate on the overlap with @xmath66 . in the limit of zero tunneling and zero separation , the overlap with @xmath66 is zero and quickly jumps to approximately 0.9 when the tunneling is increased to only a small amount of approximately 0.025 , and for increasing tunneling , @xmath87 remains relatively constant .",
    "in fact , this zero @xmath10 and large tunneling result should be compared to the single layer results we have given earlier ( fig .",
    "9(a ) in ref .  ) . for @xmath88 , in the weak tunneling limit the overlap with @xmath66 remains very small .",
    "however , in the large tunneling limit , increasing @xmath10 only reduces the overlap marginally and the pf description remains quite good even for large @xmath10 .",
    "this shows that the strong - tunneling ( one - component ) regime is well described by the pf state .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the overlap between @xmath70 and @xmath66 is never much above 0.9this should be compared to the sll where we know  @xcite that the pf wavefunction is a good physical description in the small layer separation and large tunneling limit ( see section  [ subsec - o - sll ] ) .",
    "next we consider the overlap between @xmath70 and @xmath60 .",

    "again , we ask the natural question whether our numerically obtained transition from the large-@xmath10 ( small-@xmath9 ) region to the small-@xmath10 ( large-@xmath9 ) region is a quantum phase transition or a crossover .",
    "of course a finite - size numerical study can not definitively answer this question .",
    "our results , however , are consistent with the findings  @xcite of read and green , and we believe that there would be a qpt between 331 and pf phases in the second ll since a crossover between topologically trivial ( 331 ) and non - trivial ( pf ) phases is difficult to contemplate .",
    "we also note that for the @xmath86 case , the quantum phase transition line seems to terminate at @xmath139 for the sll and for @xmath112 and _ finite _ tunneling @xmath9 in the lll , i.e. , some finite @xmath9 is required to push the system into the pf phase .",
    "thus , our sll results are more similar to the qpd of read and green  @xcite where a multi - critical point exists separating the 331 abelian phase from the non - abelian pf phase when @xmath96 .",
    "it is perhaps understandable that our sll results would more closely resemble that of read and green since they were modeling a 1/2-filled bilayer fqhe state as @xmath140 superconductor of composite fermions which is thought to be the appropriate description for the 1/2-filled fqhe in the sll , not necessarily in the lll .",
    "further , in our sll qpd , the pf phase is quite strong  as indicated by the fqhe energy gap  along the @xmath112 and finite @xmath9 line , whereas in the lll",
    ", the gap is quite small along that line .",
    "of course , the parameters in read and green s analysis are not directly related to our parameters  they have a chemical potential @xmath141 in an effective pairing hamiltonian while we have layer separation @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , our model is su(2 ) symmetric at the @xmath139 point while their model has explicitly broken su(2 ) .",
    "more work will be needed to understand completely the similarities of our approach and that of read and green definitively , but the fact that the topology of our numerically calculated phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig - gap - sll ] strongly resembles that of the phase diagram discussed by read and green is highly suggestive .    in figs .",
    "[ fig - gap - vs - d - sll](a)-(d ) and  [ fig - gap - vs - d - sll](a)-(d ) we provide a detailed view of the sll fqhe bilayer system with the fqhe energy gap given as a function of tunneling energy @xmath9 for several values of the layer separation @xmath10 and the energy gap as a function of layer separation for several values of tunneling energy , respectively .",
    "the fqhe energy gap as a function of tunneling is similar qualitatively to the results in the lll .",
    "namely , the gap rises to a peak value and then falls off . of course , for @xmath111 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - gap - vs - d - sll](d ) ) the fqhe gap structure is different than all other cases , lowest or second ll , in that the peak has turned into a valley .    in fig .  [ fig - gap - vs - d - sll ]",
    "we find that the behavior of the fqhe energy gap as a function of layer separation @xmath10 for constant tunneling energy @xmath9 is qualitatively different from the behavior in the lll .",
    "the difference is that in the sll the largest value of the energy gap is for @xmath112 and for increasing @xmath10 the energy gap decreases slightly to a minimum ( for @xmath142 ) and then rises again to a peak . for increasing tunneling energy ,",
    "the peak becomes more rounded .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively different from the lowest ll in that there are _ two _ peaks in the energy gap versus @xmath10 at constant @xmath9 instead of one  note that for @xmath86 and @xmath143 there is only a single peak not unlike the lowest ll results . for zero layer width ( @xmath86 ) , the phase boundary between the one - component pfaffian phase ( to the left of the boundary line ) and two- component 331 phase ( to the right of the boundary ) is to the left of the _ single _ peak in the energy gap for @xmath143 , moves to slightly right of the _ second _ energy gap peak for @xmath144 , and then finally moves back to being left of the _ second _ energy gap peak . for @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig - gap - vs - d - sll](b ) there are two energy gap peaks and the phase boundary is slightly to the right of the peak for @xmath145 for @xmath101 . for @xmath146 the phase boundary moves to the left of the second peak . for @xmath110 in fig .  [ fig - gap - vs - d - sll](c ) ( except for @xmath96 ) the phase boundary is always to the left of the second energy gap peak .",
    "lastly , we show results for @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig - gap - vs - d - sll](d ) for sake of completeness but it is clear that this case is most likely not a fqhe for any parameter values other than for very small @xmath10 and large @xmath9 .",
    "+    there is a conceptual difficulty that we postponed when discussing bilayer fqhe in the sll which exists when discussing _ any _ bilayer fqhe in higher lls .",
    "in fact , we carefully set up the initial sll bilayer fqhe problem as starting with a single - layer , or one - component , system in the sll ( presumably the 1/2 filled sll at @xmath3 ) and then systematically driving the system into a bilayer by the tuning of model parameters , .",
    "however , in our calculation , the electrons fractionally filling the sll remain in the sll throughout the procedure of tuning the system from one- to two - component .",
    "a bilayer fqhe at total filling factor @xmath3 would consist of two layers at single layer filling factor @xmath147 , see fig .",
    "[ fig - bilayer ] .",
    "this is compared to the lll where the half - filled bilayer fqhe consists of @xmath148 , i.e. , two layers at @xmath149 , which when combined yield total @xmath150 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - bilayer](b ) ) .",
    "the case of spin - less electrons ( we consider the spin - full situation below ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - bilayer-32 ] . in the one - component limit ,",
    "electrons in the half - filled sll have total filling factor @xmath151the lll is completely filled and considered inert . in the two - component limit , when each of the two quantum well layers have been taken far apart from one another , the filling factor in each layer ( assuming the electrons to have equal densities in each layer ) will be @xmath152 .",
    "thus , the electrons in individual layers are in the _ lowest _ ll , not the sll .",
    "the key conceptual difficulty is that we started with a one - component system at total @xmath0 in the _ second _ ll and ended up splitting it into a bilayer system of each layer at @xmath152 in the _ lowest _ ll , i.e. , the electron ll index changed !     +    if one were to study bilayer fqhe in the sll completely rigorously ( necessarily numerically ) one would have to consider  even for spin - less electrons  a system consisting of electrons with a layer degree of freedom ( pseudo - spin ) and at least two ll degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , one would not necessarily be able to treat the electrons in the lll ( the 1 in the @xmath153 ) as inert .",
    "for the system we studied with @xmath20 electrons half - filling the second ll , one would need to fully consider @xmath154 interacting electrons with a layer degree of freedom and consider at least two lls .",
    "hence , the hilbert space dimension would be extremely large  on the order of @xmath155 states .",
    "a hilbert space dimension of @xmath155 is out of reach for any numerical procedure for any computer .",
    "the experimental reality makes the situation more complicated due to the inclusion of spin .",
    "half - filled fqhe in single - layer , presumably , one - component systems has only been observed in the sll , i.e. , @xmath3 , which is modeled successfully by treating the completely filled spin - up and spin - down llls as inert . once the system is made into a bilayer we are left with , in the extreme layer separation limit , two systems at @xmath156 filling . when the layers are very far apart ( large @xmath10 and necessarily weak @xmath9 )",
    "it would be expected that the structure of the 5/4 filled systems would be identical ( since they would not interact ) and the spin - up lll would be filled and inert and the remaining electrons would fill the spin - down lll up to 1/4 filling .",
    "such a situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - bilayer-52](b ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the system is barely becoming two - component , perhaps the simplest possibility is that the two @xmath157 layers will consist of a completely filled spin - up lll in one layer and spin - down ll in the other layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - bilayer-52](a ) ) . however , when the two layers are close enough that they begin to interact with one another  even without any tunneling ",
    "the situation quickly becomes complicated ( as discussed below ) .",
    "it is not clear if _ any _ of the electrons in a bilayer fqhe at total @xmath3 can be considered inert and one might need to consider an interacting electron system where the electrons carry spin , pseudo - spin , and two , or possibly three , lls indices , making such a problem intractable .",
    "+    we note that considering each layer to have @xmath158 filling so that , in analogy with the lll bilayer situation , we have 1/4 filling in each sll layer , does not resolve the ambiguity since this produces a total filling of @xmath159 , taking us to the half - filled _ third _ orbital ll ! similarly , considering each layer to have @xmath160 filling leads to a total bilayer filling of @xmath3 , but takes us from the lll to the sll in going from a one layer to a bilayer system .",
    "the conundrum here is not theoretical , but is about how one connects the theoretical results with the experimental bilayer 5/2 system .",
    "we emphasize that no such ambiguity arises for the @xmath161 bilayer system where all of the physics occurs in the lll , both for individual layers and for the total bilayer .",
    "also , there is no ambiguity in the strong tunneling regime where the bilayer effectively acts as a single layer system with @xmath3 as in a single 2d system .    for our fully spin - polarized model",
    ", however , there is an easy conceptual ( and operational ) way out of this ambiguity for the bilayer @xmath3 system . since we assume the whole system ( in both layers and in both orbital landau levels ) to have the same spin , the system is effectively spin - less ( which is equivalent to assuming the zeeman energy to be much larger than the cyclotron energy ) . in this spin - less ( or spin - polarized ) situation ,",
    "each orbital ll by definition comes with just one spin index .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 balanced bilayer system is equivalent to a @xmath162 filling in each layer , where the completely filled inert level in each layer is simply the lll , and the 1/4-filled level in each layer is in the sll .",
    "since the lll is inert , the incompressible fqh states form entirely in the sll , and we can construct a halperin 331 sll state with @xmath0 from the two 1/4-filled sll states in each individual layer in a manner similar to that for the @xmath0 lll bilayer state .",
    "we emphasize that this simplicity is lost if we include both spin and layer indices on an equal footing since including the two spin indices ( up and down ) and two layer indices ( right and left ) lead to an immediate problem on how to assign individual @xmath163 values which , when combined into the total @xmath164 , lead to a bilayer sll @xmath3 fqhe with _ both _ the total bilayer ( i.e. , @xmath165 ) and the individual layer ( i.e. , @xmath166 ) filling factor being in the sll .",
    "( as emphasized already , the situation with two layers , two spins , and two orbital lls is ambiguous unless the numerical diagonalization takes exactly into account the full dynamics of all three two - level quantum indices which is impossible to do for any computer . )",
    "we mention that earlier theoretical work ( alluded to above ) by zheng _",

    "_ ,  @xcite , demler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and brey _ et al . _",
    "@xcite did take into account the dynamical interplay between layer and spin indices with the conclusion that there should be a novel quantum canted antiferromagnetic phase in bilayers for situations where each individual layer state has a gap in the spectrum ( e.g. , @xmath167 or @xmath168 or @xmath169 ) .",
    "for the case we are considering in the current work , i.e. , @xmath3 and @xmath170 , there is not necessarily a gap in the individual layer spectrum , and therefore a canted phase is not expected .",
    "our results concerning the @xmath0 lll fqhe bilayer system point to strong evidence that the dominant fqh phase is the two - component abelian halperin 331 phase .",
    "we believe that the only chance of observing the @xmath0 non - abelian moore - read pfaffian fqhe is to look on the pf side of the phase boundary ( fig .  [ fig - gap - lll ] ) at fairly large values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "this contrasts the sll bilayer situation where there are two sharp ridges far away from each other in the @xmath10-@xmath9 space corresponding to the pf and 331 phases .",
    "we note that for unrealistically large single layer width @xmath11 the pf phase dominates the 331 phase but the fqhe gap is extremely small .",
    "if the pf phase exists at all , it would manifest most strongly in wide samples and close to the phase boundary with the 331 phase .    in addition",
    ", we predict the existence of both the two - component 331 abelian ( at intermediate to large @xmath10 and small @xmath9 ) and the one - component pfaffian non - abelian ( at small @xmath10 and intermediate to large @xmath9 ) @xmath3 sll fqhe phase in bilayer structures .",
    "the observation of these two topologically distinct phases , one ( pf ) stabilized by large inter - layer tunneling and the other ( 331 ) stabilized by large inter - layer separation would be a spectacular verification of the theoretical expectation  @xcite that bilayer structures allow quantum phase transitions between topologically trivial and non - trivial paired even - denominator incompressible fqhe states .",
    "the direct experimental observation of our predicted `` two distinct branches '' of two strong sll fqhe regimes in bilayer structures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - gap - sll](a)-(c ) , with the fqhe gap being largest along the two ridges in the phase diagram as @xmath10 and @xmath9 are varied , will be compelling evidence for the existence of the @xmath3 non - abelian pf state .    note that for small @xmath10 and @xmath9 , pf and 331 phases are continuously connected , indicating the possible existence of a quantum phase transition .",
    "we can not , of course , dismiss a crossover due to the limitations of finite size calculations , but it is difficult to contemplate how an abelian and non - abelian phase could continuously go into each other without a quantum phase transition .    besides our exact diagonalization results for the bilayer @xmath0 and 5/2 fqhe , we have raised an important conceptual issue involving the existence of halperin type bilayer fqhe states in higher ( i.e. , beyond the lowest ) landau levels . in particular , the fact that two well - separated distinct layers have individual filling factors @xmath171 , which necessarily lie in a lower orbital ll , make it tricky to define a composite bilayer halperin wavefunction for @xmath165 which is in a higher ll .",
    "( this problem obviously does not arise in the lll . )",
    "it is conceivable that any theoretical study of bilayer fqhe states in higher lls must necessarily include the full dynamics involving layer , orbital ll , and spin degrees of freedom .",
