    "although bcs theory only contemplates the presence of `` cooper correlations '' of single - particle states , bf models @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite posit the existence of actual bosonic cps .",
    "such pair charge carriers have been observed in magnetic flux quantization experiments on elemental @xcite as well as on cuprate @xcite  superconductors ( scs ) .",

    "the fundamental drawback of early @xcite-@xcite bf models , which took 2e bosons as analogous to diatomic molecules in a classical atom - molecule gas mixture , is the notorious absence of an electron energy gap @xmath5 .",
    "`` gapless '' models can not describe the superconducting state at all , although they are useful in locating transition temperatures if approached from above , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "even so , we are not aware of any calculations with the early bf models attempting to reproduce any empirical @xmath2 values . the gap first began to appear in later bf models @xcite-@xcite . with two @xcitepla2  exceptions ,",
    "however , all bf models neglect the effect of _ hole _ cps included on an equal footing with electron cps to give  a `` complete '' bf model ( cbfm ) consisting of _ both _ bosonic cp species coexisting with unpaired electrons .    for 13 years",

    "it was then sketched how five statistical continuum theories of superconductivity  including both the bcs and bec theories  are contained as special limiting cases within a single theory , the `` complete boson - fermion model '' ( cbfm ) .",

    "ordinary bec theory , on the other hand , is recovered from the cbfm when hole pairs are completely neglected , the bf coupling @xmath312 is made to vanish , and the limit of zero unpaired electrons is taken .",
    "lastly , the practical outcome of the bcs - bec unification via the cbfm is fourfold : a ) _ enhancements _ in @xmath2 , by more than an order - of - magnitude in 2d , and more than two orders - of - magnitude in 3d , are obtained with pure electron - pair , and even more so with pure hole - pair , be condensates for the same electron - phonon dynamics mimicked by the bcs model interaction ; b ) these enhancements in @xmath2 fall within empirical ranges for 2d and 3d `` exotic '' scs , whereas bcs @xmath2 values remain low and within the empirical ranges for conventional , elemental scs using standard interaction - parameter values ; c ) hole - doped scs are predicted in both 2d and 3d to have higher @xmath2 s than electron - doped ones , in agreement with observation ; and finally that d ) room temperature superconductivity is possible , with the _ _  same _ _ interaction parameters _ _  _ _ used in bcs theory for conventional scs ,  but only via hole - pair be condensates .    * acknowledgements",
