    "optical systems are one of the major candidates for implementations of quantum information processing",
    ". there are different ways for qubit encoding for optical quantum information processing . probably , the most well - known method is to use a single photon with its polarization degree of freedom .",
    "quantum teleportation experiments have been performed using such polarized single photons ( psps ) as qubits @xcite and quantum computing protocols based on linear optics have been developed along this line @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to use the vacuum and single - photon ( vsp ) states as the basis for qubit encoding @xcite .",
    "coherent - state qubits have been studied as an alternative approach to optical quantum information processing @xcite with their advantages in teleportation @xcite .",
    "efficient transfer of qubits is an important factor in quantum information processing .",
    "it is particularly crucial for quantum communication and quantum networks @xcite .",
    "a comparison among the different types of qubits in terms of transfer efficiencies would be indispensable in order to build an efficient hybrid architecture for optical quantum information processing @xcite in a lossy environment .",
    "there are different ways to transfer qubits , for example , such as direct transmission and quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "compared @xcite the teleportation scheme for continuous - variable states @xcite with the direct transmission through a noisy channel .",
    "they showed that the teleportation scheme shows better transmission performance than the direct transmission in strong decoherence regions @xcite .",
    "park and jeong compared effects of photon losses and detection inefficiency on entangled coherent states and entangled photon - polarized states for quantum teleportation @xcite . extending these investigations ,",
    "we are interested in comparisons for both the direct transmission and teleportation with the three aforementioned qubit - based approaches .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate and compare fidelities of information transfer for the three different types of photonic qubits over a lossy environment .",
    "we find that teleportation is more robust to photon losses than the direct transmission for vsp qubits , psp qubits , and coherent - state qubits with small amplitudes .",
    "while vsp qubits are the most robust ones to photon losses , coherent - state qubits with small amplitudes are more robust than the psp qubits for optical quantum information transfer . in terms of the success probabilities for quantum teleportation based on linear optics , vsp qubits and coherent - state qubits are found to outperform psp qubits under photon loss effects .",
    "+      we first consider a vsp qubit , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the vacuum and single - photon states , respectively . this type of encoding strategy is sometimes referred to as the single - rail logic because it is defined by the occupation of a single optical mode @xcite .",
    "state preperations and operations have been demonstrated experimentally using the single - rail logic @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of density operator @xmath4 under photon losses is governed by the born - markov master equation @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the interaction time , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the decay constant , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for mode @xmath12 . the general solution of eq .",
    "is written as , @xmath13\\rho(0)$ ] , where @xmath14 is the initial density operator @xcite .",
    "a vsp qubit under the direct transmission with photon losses is simply obtained as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the average fidelity between input and output states is @xmath20    a schematic comparison between the direct transmission and the teleportation process is presented in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "in general , the quantum teleporation protocol for a qubit @xcite requires a bipartite entangled state as the quantum channel in addition to a bell - state measurement scheme that discriminates the four entangled states called the bell states .",
    "the sender s outcome for the bell - state measurement is sent to the receiver through a classical channel so that the input state can be reconstructed by the receiver using an appropriate unitary transform ( @xmath21 in fig .  [ scheme ] ) @xcite .",
    "we now consider quantum teleportation of the vsp qubit using an entangled channel : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 _ etc_. the entangled channel at time @xmath6 is obtained using eq .",
    "as @xmath24 with which the teleportation is performed .",
    "the interaction time here should be half of the interaction time for the direct transmission because the each part of entangled channel travels half of the length for the direct transmission as depicted in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "the bell - state measurement is performed to discriminate between the four bell states , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as a joint measurement for the input state and the sender s part of the entangled channel .",
    "if the outcome of the bell - state measurement was @xmath27 , the required unitary transform is the @xmath28 operation that corresponds to @xmath29 phase shift . if the outcome was @xmath30 , the receiver does not need to do anything .",
    "however , a typical bell measurement scheme using linear optics and photodetectors @xcite can not discriminate the other two bell state , @xmath31 , so that the success probability is limited to 50% @xcite .",
    "the teleported state after an appropriate unitary transform is @xmath32 and the average success probability is @xmath33_{\\rm avg}\\\\ & + { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\langle\\psi",

    "interestingly , the success probability is not affected by photon losses even though the average fidelity is degraded as already implied in eq .  .",
    "the average fidelity for the successful events obtained in the same way as the case of the direct transmission is @xmath34 where @xmath6 was replaced by @xmath35 for a comparison with the direct transmission . as shown in fig .",
    "[ single](a ) , the average fidelity of teleportation @xmath36 is always higher than that of the direct transmission @xmath37 .",
    "the figure also shows that @xmath36 goes below the classical limit 2/3 @xcite at @xmath38 while @xmath37 does so at @xmath39 .",
    "+      a psp qubit is represented as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to horizontally and vertically polarized states , respectively .",
    "using eq .  , it is straightforward to find that a psp qubit in the direct transmission under photon losses evolves as @xmath43 and the average fidelity is obtained as @xmath44 .",
    "we then consider quantum teleportation for a psp qubit using an entangled channel : @xmath45 . the entangled channel at time @xmath6 obtained using eq .",

    "the teleported state after the bell - state measurement and a correct unitary transform is found to be identical to @xmath50 for the case of the direct transmission in eq .  .",
    "again , only two of the bell states , @xmath51 , can be identified using linear optics @xcite and required unitary transforms are the identity operation and the @xmath28 operation that is realized with a half - wave plate .",

    "their large - size implementation is possible using the non - deterministic amplification scheme @xcite , a fock state with a large number @xcite , or multiple photon subtractions @xcite but it is yet experimentally challenging .",
    "coherent - state qubits not only lose their coherence but also undergo amplitude damping under photon losses . however , as the interaction time @xmath6 is the value known to the sender and the receiver , we can use @xmath61 as a dynamic qubit basis in order to reflect the amplitude damping as suggested in ref .",
    "adopting damped coherent states @xmath61 as the dynamic qubit basis , the time dependent target coherent - state qubit which we want the receiver to have is @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are some complex numbers and @xmath65 is normalization constant . to achieve this purpose ,",
    "the sender actually transmit the state @xmath66 .",
    "it is straightforward to find that the initial state @xmath66 under direct transmission evolves to @xmath67 since the coherent states @xmath61 are not orthogonal to each other , we need an orthonormal basis which spans the input and the output states in order to obtain average fidelity on the bloch sphere .",

    "several different types of qubits have been suggested for optical quantum information processing and each of them has its own merits and limitations . a hybrid architecture",
    "using different types of qubits may be an efficient way to implement practical quantum information processing based on optical systems @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is important to make a thorough comparison among the different types of qubits in terms of transfer efficiencies in a lossy environment .",
    "we have compared three well - known different types of optical qubits , vsp , psp and coherent - state qubits , for information transfer via quantum teleportation and direction transmission under photon losses .",
    "of course , it should be noted that quantum teleportation always suffers lower success probabilities compared to the direct transmission if available resources are limited to linear optics elements and photon detectors in addition to the entangled pair @xcite .",
    "however , as far as fidelities are concerned , quantum teleportation always outperforms the direct transmission when vsp and psp qubits are used .",
    "the same applies to the coherent - state qubits when their amplitudes are as small as @xmath87 . on the other hand",
    ", the teleportation outperforms the direct transmission in the strong decoherence regions for the coherent - state qubits with large amplitudes .",
    "we have found that vsp qubits are the most robust ones against photon losses both for quantum teleportation and for the direct transmission .",
    "coherent - state qubits with small amplitudes ( @xmath94 for direct transmission and @xmath95 for teleportation ) are more robust to photon losses than psp qubits in optical quantum information transfer , whereas the coherent - state qubits with large amplitudes outperforms psp qubits only in the strong decoherence regions .",
    "this means that coherent - state qubits may be more effective than psp qubits for optical quantum information transfer particularly when photon loss effects are heavy .",
    "the success probabilities for teleportation of coherent - state qubits and vsp qubits ( _ i.e. _ , 1/2 regardless of losses ) are always greater than that of psp qubits ( _ i.e. _ , smaller than 1/2 under lossy effects ) .",
    "overall , vsp qubits are the most efficient for quantum information transfer under photon loss effects among the three types of qubits .    in spite of our results clearly unfavorable to the psp qubits , the psp qubits may be preferred for certain applications such as quantum key distribution using single photons in which post - selection plays an important role @xcite . in this type of post - selection process , a result is simply discarded whenever any photon is missing at the final measurement .",
    "this is not so straightforward with the vsp or coherent - state qubits because the photon numbers of those qubits are inherently indefinite .    in this paper , we have compared three types of optical qubits that can be represented by single - mode states .",
    "our results would provide useful and timely information for the development of practical optical quantum information processing .",
    "it would be an interesting future work to extend this comparison to optical qudits @xcite , continuous variable systems @xcite , and hybrid qubits @xcite .",
