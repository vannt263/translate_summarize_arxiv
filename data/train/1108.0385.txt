    "the interaction between currents and magnetization can also cause undesirable effects such as enhanced magnetic noise in read heads made from magnetic multilayers@xcite .",
    "while most research has been carried out on metallic structures , current - induced magnetization dynamics in semiconductors@xcite or even insulators@xcite has been pursued as well .",
    "physicists have been attracted in large numbers to these issues because on top of the practical aspects the underlying phenomena are so fascinating .",
    "berger@xcite and slonczewski@xcite are in general acknowledged to have started the whole field by introducing the concept of current - induced magnetization dynamics by the transfer of spin .",
    "the importance of their work was fully appreciated only after experimental confirmation of the predictions in multi - layered structures@xcite . the reciprocal effect , _ i.e._. the generation of currents by magnetization dynamics now called _",
    "spin pumping _ , has been expected long ago@xcite , but it took some time before tserkovnyak _ et al_. @xcite developed a rigorous theory of spin - pumping for magnetic multi - layers , including the associated increased magnetization damping@xcite .",
    "spin - transfer torque and spin pumping in magnetic metallic multi - layers are by now relatively well understood and the topic has been covered by a number of review articles @xcite .",
    "it can be understood very well in terms of a time - dependent extension of magneto - electronic circuit theory@xcite , which corresponds to the assumption of spin diffusion in the bulk and quantum mechanical boundary conditions at interfaces .",
    "random matrix theory@xcite can be shown to be equivalent to circuit theory@xcite .",
    "the technologically important current - induced switching in magnetic tunnel junctions has recently been the focus of attention@xcite .",
    "tunnel junctions limit the transport such that circuit issues are less important , whereas the quantum - mechanical nature of the tunneling process becomes essential .",
    "we will not review this issue in more detail here .",
    "the interaction of currents and magnetization in continuous magnetization textures has also attracted much interest , partly due to possible applications such as nonvolatile shift registers@xcite . from a formal point of view",
    "the physics of current - magnetization interaction in a continuum poses new challenges as compared to heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces . in magnetic textures such as magnetic domain walls , currents interact over length scales corresponding to the wall widths that are usually much longer than even the transport mean - free path .",
    "issues of the in - plane _ vs. _ magnetic - field like torque@xcite and the spin - motive force in moving magnetization textures@xcite took some time to get sorted out , but the understanding of the complications associated with continuous textures has matured by now .",
    "there is now general consensus about the physics of current - induced magnetization excitations and magnetization dynamics induced currents@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the similarities and differences of spin torque and spin pumping in discrete and continuous magnetic systems has to our knowledge never been discussed in a coherent fashion .",
    "it has also only recently been realized that both phenomena are directly related , since they reflect identical microscopic correlations according to the onsager reciprocity relations@xcite .      in this chapter ,",
    "we ( i ) review the basic understandings of spin transfer torque _ vs. _ spin pumping and ( ii ) knit together our understanding of both concepts for heterogeneous and homogeneous systems .",
    "we discuss the general phenomenology guided by onsager s reciprocity in the linear response regime@xcite .",
    "we will compare the in- and out - of - plane spin transfer torques at interfaces as governed by the real and imaginary part of the so - called spin - mixing conductances with that in textures , which are usually associated with the adiabatic torque and its dissipative correction@xcite , usually described by a dimensionless factor @xmath0 in order to stress the relation with the gilbert damping constant @xmath1 .",
    "we argue that the spin pumping phenomenon at interfaces between magnets and conductors is identical to the spin - motive force due to magnetization texture dynamics such as moving domain walls@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that spin pumping is on a microscopic level identical to the spin transfer torque , thus arriving at a significantly simplified conceptual picture of the coupling between currents and magnetization .",
    "we also point out that we are not limited to a phenomenological description relying on fitting parameters by demonstrating that the material dependence of crucial parameters such as @xmath1 and @xmath0 _ _ can be computed from first principles .",
    "in this section we explain the basics physics of spin - pumping and spin - transfer torques , introduce the dependence on material and externally applied parameters , and prove their equivalence in terms of onsager s reciprocity theorem .      on a microscopic level electrons behave as wave - like fermions with quantized intrinsic angular momentum . however , in order to understand the electron wave packets at the fermi energy in high - density metals and the collective motion of a large number of spins at not too low temperatures classical analogues can be useful .",
    "spin transfer torque and spin pumping are on a fundamental level mechanical phenomena that can be compared with the game of billiards , which is all about the transfer of linear and angular momenta between the balls and cushions .",
    "a skilled player can use the cue to transfer velocity and spin to the billiard ball in a controlled way .",
    "the path of the spinning ball is governed by the interaction with the reservoirs of linear and angular momentum ( the cushions and the felt / baize ) and with other balls during collisions . a ball that for instance hits the cushion at normal angle with top or bottom spin will reverse its rotation and translation , thereby transferring twice its linear and angular moment to the frame of the billiard .",
    "since the work by barnett@xcite and einstein - de haas@xcite almost a century ago , we know that magnetism is caused by the magnetic moment of the electron , which is intimately related with its mechanical angular momentum . how angular momentum transfer occurs between electrons in magnetic structures can be imagined mechanically : just replace the billiard balls by spin polarized electrons and the cushion by a ferromagnet .",
    "good metallic interfaces correspond to a cushion with high friction .",
    "the billiard ball reverses angular and linear momentum , whereas the electron is reflected with a spin flip .",
    "while the cushion and the billiard table absorb the angular momentum , the magnetization absorbs the spin angular momentum .",
    "the absorbed spins correspond to a torque that , if exceeding a critical value , will set the magnetization into motion .",
    "analogously , a time - dependent magnetization injects net angular momentum into a normal metal contact .",
    "this spin pumping  effect , _",
    "i.e. _ the main topic of this chapter , can be also visualized mechanically : a billiard ball without spin will pick up  angular momentum under reflection if the cushion is rotating along its axis .",
    "ferromagnets do not easily change the modulus of the magnetization vector due to large exchange energy costs .",
    "the low - energy excitations , so - called spin waves or magnons , only modulate the magnetization direction with respect to the equilibrium magnetization configuration . in this regime",
    "the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnets can be described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation,@xmath2 where @xmath3 is a unit vector along the magnetization direction , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is ( minus ) the gyro - magnetic ratio in terms of the effective @xmath6-factor and the bohr magneton @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the gilbert damping tensor that determines the magnetization dissipation rate . under isothermal conditions the effective magnetic field @xmath9 /\\delta(m_{s}\\mathbf{m})$ ]",
    "is governed by the magnetic  free energy @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "we will consider both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous situations . in the former case ,",
    "the magnetization is constant in space ( macrospin ) , while the torques are applied at the interfaces . in the latter case",
    ", the effective magnetic field @xmath12 also includes a second order spatial gradient arising from the ( exchange ) rigidity of the magnetization and torques as well as motive forces that are distributed in the ferromagnet .",
    "( [ llg ] ) can be rewritten in the form of the landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation : @xmath13 additional torques due to the coupling between currents and magnetization dynamics should be added to the right - hand side of the llg or ll equation , but some care should be exercised in order to keep track of dissipation in a consistent manner . in our approach",
    "the spin - pumping and spin - transfer torque contributions are most naturally added to the llg equation ( [ llg ] ) , but we will also make contact with the ll equation  ( [ ll ] ) while exploring the onsager reciprocity relations .    in the remaining part of this section",

    "[ discrete ] and sec .",
    "[ continuous ] , respectively . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate in more detail how spin - pumping and spin - transfer torque are related by onsager reciprocity relations for both discrete and continuous systems .",
    "berger and slonczewski predicted that in spin - valve structures with current perpendicular to the interface planes ( cpp ) a dc current can excite and even reverse the reverse the relative magnetization of magnetic layers separated by a normal metal spacer@xcite .",
    "the existence of this phenomenon has been amply confirmed by experiments@xcite .",
    "we can understand current - induced magnetization dynamics from first principles in terms of the coupling of spin - dependent transport with the magnetization . in a ferromagnetic metal majority and minority electron spins have often very different electronic structures .",
    "spins that are polarized non - collinear with respect to the magnetization direction are not eigenstates of the ferromagnet , but can be described as a coherent linear combination of majority and minority electron spins at the given energy shell . if injected at an interface , these states precess on time and length scales that depend on the orbital part of the wave function . in high electron - density transition metal ferromagnets like co , ni , and fe a large number of wave vectors are available at the fermi energy .",
    "a transverse spin current injected from a diffuse reservoir generates a large number of wave functions oscillating with different wave length that lead to efficient destructive interference or decoherence of the spin momentum . beyond a transverse magnetic coherence length , which in these materials is of the order of the fermi wave length , typically around 1 nm , a transversely polarized spin current can not persist.@xcite this destruction of transverse angular momentum is per definition equal to a torque",
    "slonczewski s spin - transfer torque is therefore equivalent to the absorption of a spin current at an interface between a normal metal and a ferromagnet whose magnetization is transverse to the spin current polarization .",

    "their ratio @xmath379 turns out to be close to unity , where @xmath1 is the bulk gilbert damping .",
    "the importance of large spin - texture gradients on the domain - wall and vortex dynamics was theoretically discussed in refs .  .",
    "the material dependence of the current - induced torques is not yet well investigated .",
    "a recent study on coni and fept wires with perpendicular magnetization found @xmath380 , in spite of the relatively narrow domain walls in these materials.@xcite current - induced domain - wall dynamics in dilute magnetic semiconductors@xcite generally exhibit similar phenomenology , but a detailed discussion , especially of the domain wall creep regime that can be accessed in these systems , is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "finally , the first term in the spin - pumping expression ( [ currentpumpingcont ] ) has been measured by yang _ _ et  al.__@xcite for a domain wall moved by an applied magnetic field above the walker breakdown field .",
    "these experiments confirmed the existence of pumping effects in magnetic textures , which are onsager reciprocal of spin torques and thus expected on general grounds .",
    "similar experiments carried out below the walker breakdown would also give direct access to the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "a spin polarized current can excite magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets via spin - transfer torques .",
    "the reciprocal phenomena is spin - pumping where a dynamic magnetization pumps spins into adjacent conductors .",
    "we have discussed how spin - transfer torques and spin - pumping are directly related by onsager reciprocity relations .    in layered normal metal - ferromagnet systems ,",
    "spin - transfer torques can be expressed in terms of two conductance parameters governing the flow of spins transverse to the magnetization direction and the spin - accumulation in the normal metal . in metallic systems , the field - like torque is typically much smaller than the effective energy gain / damping torque , but in tunnel systems they might become comparable .",
    "spin - pumping is controlled by the same transverse conductance parameters as spin - transfer torques , the magnetization direction and its rate of change .",
    "it can lead to an enhanced magnetization dissipation in ultra - thin ferromagnets or a build - up of spins , a spin - battery , in normal metals where the spin - flip relaxation rate is low .",
    "spin - transfer torque and spin - pumping phenomena in magnetization textures are similar to their counterparts in layered normal metal - ferromagnet systems .",
    "a current becomes spin polarized in a ferromagnet and this spin - polarized current in a magnetization texture gives rise to a reactive torque and a dissipative torque in the lowest gradient expansion .",
    "the reciprocal pumping phenomena can be viewed as an electromotive force , the dynamic magnetization texture pumps a spin - current that in turn is converted to a charge current or voltage by the giant magnetoresistance effect . naturally , the parameters governing the spin - transfer torques and the pumping phenomena are also the same in continuously textured ferromagnets .",
    "when the spin - orbit interaction becomes sufficiently strong , additional effects arise in the coupling between the magnetization and itinerant electrical currents .",
    "a charge potential can then by itself induce a torque on the ferromagnet and the reciprocal phenomena is that a precessing ferromagnet can induce a charge current in the adjacent media .",
    "the latter can be an alternative way to carry out fmr measurements on small ferromagnets by measuring the induced voltage across a normal metal - ferromagnet - normal metal device .",
