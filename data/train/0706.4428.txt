    "since the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is extremely isotropic in nearly all angular scales , it is rather plausible to infer that the universe was quite homogeneous ( and isotropic ) at the moment when the ionization fraction dropped significantly and the photon mean free path became , almost suddenly , comparable with the present hubble radius .",
    "the inhomogeneities present for length - scales larger than the hubble radius right before recombination are believed to be , ultimately , the seeds of structure formation and they can be studied by looking at the temperature autocorrelations which are customarily illustrated in terms of the angular power spectrum .",
    "the distinctive features of the angular power spectrum ( like the doppler peaks ) can be phenomenologically reproduced by assuming the presence , before recombination , of a primordial adiabatic and discussions therein.]mode arising in a spatially flat universe @xcite .",
    "possible deviations from this working hypothesis can also be bounded : they include , for instance , the plausible presence of non - adiabatic modes ( see @xcite and references therein ) , or even features in the power - spectrum that could be attributed either to the pre - inflationary stage of expansion or to the effective modification of the dispersion relations ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for a pedagogical introduction to the physics of cmb anisotropies",
    "see , for instance , ref . @xcite . in short the purpose of the present paper is to show that cmb temperature autocorrelations may also be a source of valuable informations on large - scale magnetic fields whose possible presence prior to recombination sheds precious light on the origin of the largest magnetized structures we see today in the sky such as galaxies , clusters of galaxies and even some supercluster .",
    "in fact , spiral galaxies and rich clusters possess a large - scale magnetic field that ranges from @xmath0 ng @xcite ( in the case of abell clusters ) to few @xmath1 g in the case of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "elliptical galaxies have also magnetic fields in the @xmath1 g range but with correlation scales of the order of @xmath2@xmath3 pc ( i.e. much smaller than in the spirals where typical correlation lengths are of the order of @xmath4 kpc , as in the case of the milky way ) . the existence of large - scale magnetic fields in superclusters , still debatable because of ambiguities in the determination of the column density of electrons along the line of sight",
    ", would be rather intriguing .",
    "recently plausible indications of the existence of magnetized structures in hercules and perseus - pisces superclusters have been reported @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : the typical correlation scales of the fields whould be @xmath5 mpc and the intensity 300 ng .    while there exist various ideas put forward throught the years , it is fair to say that the origin of these ( pretty large ) fields is still matter of debate @xcite . even if they are , roughly , one millionth of a typical planetary magnetic field ( such as the one of the earth ) these fields are pretty large for a cosmological standard since their energy density is comparable both with energy density of the cmb photons ( i.e. @xmath6 ) and with the cosmic ray pressure",
    ". the very presence of large scale magnetic fields in diffuse astrophysical plasmas and with large correlation scales ( as large of , at least , @xmath4 kpc ) seems to point towards a possible primordial origin @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the efficiency of dynamo amplification can be questioned in different ways so that , at the onset of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy it seems rather plausible that only magnetic fields with intensities we denote the magnetic field smoothed over a typical comoving scale @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "this choice is purely conventional and refers to the occurrence that the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy occurs over a typical comoving scale of the mpc .",
    "the usefulness of this convention will become clear later on.]@xmath9 ng may be , eventually , amplified at an observable level @xcite .    as emphasized many years ago by harrison @xcite , this situation is a bit reminiscent of what happened with the problem of justifying the presence of a flat spectrum of curvature perturbations that could eventually seed the structure formation paradigm . today a possibility along this direction is provided by inflationary models in one of their various incarnations .",
    "it seems therefore appropriate , especially in view of forthcoming satellite missions ( like planck explorer @xcite ) , to discuss the effects of large - scale magnetic fields on cmb physics .",
    "in fact , all along the next decade dramatic improvements in the quality and quantity of cmb data can be expected . on the radio - astronomical side ,",
    "the next generation of radio - telescopes such as square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite might be able to provide us with unprecedented accuracy in the full sky survey of faraday rotation measurements at frequencies that may be so large to be , roughly , comparable with .",
    "the angular resolution of ska is designed to be of @xmath10 arcsec at @xmath11 ghz .",
    "the frequency capability of the instrument will presumably be between @xmath10 and @xmath12 ghz . while the frequency range may be optimistic , it is certainly inspiring to think that @xmath12 ghz is not so far from the @xmath4 ghz of the low - frequency channel of the planck explorer @xcite .",
    "this occurrence might have a relevant experimental impact for the possible analysis of faraday rotated cmb polarization , as recently emphasized @xcite . ]",
    "( even if always smaller than ) the lower frequency channel of the planck explorer ( i.e. about 30 ghz ) . the question before us today is , therefore , the following : is cmb itself able to provide compelling bounds on the strength of large - scale magnetic fields prior to hydrogen recombination ?",
    "in fact , all the arguments connecting the present strength of magnetic field to their primordial value ( say before recombination ) suffer undeniable ambiguities .",
    "these ambiguities are related to the evolution of the universe through the dark ages ( i.e. approximately , between photon decoupling and galaxy formation ) .",
    "so , even if it is very reasonable to presume that during the stage of galaxy formation the magnetic flux and helicity are , according to alfvn theorems , approximately conserved , the strengths of the fields prior to gravitational collapse is unknown and it is only predictable within a specific model for the origin of large - scale magnetic fields . in general terms , the magnetic fields produced in the early universe may have different features . they may be helical or not , they may have different spectral slopes and different intensities .",
    "there are , however , aspects that are common to diverse mechanisms like the stochastic nature of the produced field .",
    "furthermore , since as we go back in time the conductivity increases with the temperature , it can be expected that the flux freezing and the helicity conservation are better and better verified as the universe heats up say from few ev to few mev .",
    "along the past decade some studies addressed the analysis of vector and tensor modes induced by large - scale magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there have been also investigations within a covariant approach to perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "only recently the analysis of the scalar modes has been undertaken @xcite .",
    "the set - up of the aforementioned analyses is provided by an effective one - fluid description of the plasma which is essentially the curved space analog of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "this approach is motivated since the typical length - scales of the problem are much larger of the debye length .",
    "however , it should be borne in mind that the treatment of faraday rotation is a typical two - fluid phenomenon .",
    "so if we would like to ask the question on how the polarization plane of the cmb is rotated by the presence of a uniform magnetic field a two - fluid description would be mandatory ( see section 2 and references therein ) .    in the framework described in the previous paragraph , it has been shown that the magnetic fields affect the scalar modes in a threefold way . in the first place",
    "the magnetic energy density and pressure gravitate inducing a computable modification of the large - scale adiabatic solution .",
    "moreover , the anisotropic stress and the divergence of the lorentz force affect the evolution of the baryon - lepton fluid .",
    "since , prior to decoupling , photons and baryons are tightly coupled the net effect will also be a modification of the temperature autocorrelations at angular scales smaller than the ones relevant for the ordinary sw contribution ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "elaborating on the formalism developed in @xcite , a semi - analtytical approach for the calculation of the temperature autocorrelations is proposed .",
    "such a framework allows the estimate of the angular power spectrum also for angular scales compatible with the first doppler peak .",
    "a gravitating magnetic field will be included from the very beginning and its effects discussed both at large angular scales and small angular scales .",
    "the main theme of the present paper can then be phrased by saying that large - scale magnetic fields affect the geometry and the evolution of the ( scalar ) sources .",
    "we ought to compute how all these effects combine in the final power spectra of the temperature autocorrelations .",
    "it should be remarked , incidentally , that the vector and the tensor modes are only partially coupled to the evolution of the various plasma quantities while the treatment of the scalar modes necessarily requires a consistent inclusion of large - scale magnetic fields in the equations governing the evolution of the gravitational perturbations .",
    "the plan of the present paper will therefore be the following . in section 2",
    "the typical scales of the problem will be discussed . in section 3 the attention",
    "will be focused on the large - scale evolution of the curvature perturbations with particular attention to the magnetized contribution , i.e. the contribution associated with the gravitating magnetic fields . in section 4 the evolution at smaller angular scales will be investigated accounting , in an approximate manner , for the finite thickness effects of the last - scattering surface . in section 5 the estimates of the angular power spectra of the temperature autocorrelations will be presented .",
    "section 6 contains the concluding remarks .",
    "some of the relevant theoretical tools needed for the discussion of the problem have been collected in the appendix with the sole aim to make the overall presentation more self - contained .",
    "the material presented in the appendix collects the main equations whose solutions are reported and discussed in section 3 and 4 .",
    "the analysis starts by defining all the relevant physical scales of the problem .",
    "these scales stem directly from the evolution equations of the gravitational perturbations in the presence of a stochastic magnetic field",

    "furthermore the protons and the electrons are even more tightly coupled , among them , by coulomb scattering whose rate is larger than the thompson rate of interaction . when the ionization fraction drops the photon mean free path gets as large as @xmath45 mpc . for the purposes of this investigation",

    "the theorem of flux conservation states then that the energetical properties of large - scale magnetic fields are conserved throughout the plasma evolution .    while the flux conservation concerns the energetic properties of the magnetic flux lines , the magnetic helicity , i.e. eq .

    ", the magnetic flux lines will be closed loops evolving independently in the plasma and the helicity will vanish",

    "furthermore , in the superconducting limit , the helicity will not change throughout the time evolution .",

    "furthermore , for the nature of the approximations made we do not expect the greatest accuracy of the algorithm in the intermediate region ( i.e. @xmath332 ) .",

    ", it is appropriate to comment on the choice of the cosmological parameters that will be employed throughout this section .",
    "the wmap 3-year @xcite data have been combined , so far , with various sets of data .",
    "these data sets include the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , the combination of boomerang and acbar data @xcite , the combination of cbi and vsa data @xcite .",
    "furthermore the wmap 3-year data can be also combined with the hubble space telescope key project ( hstkp ) data @xcite as well as with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite data . finally , the wmap 3-year data can be also usefully combined with the weak lensing data @xcite and with theobservations of type ia supernovae(snia ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     thus , according to the results described so far it is possible to say that to avoid gross distortion of the temperature autocorrelations attributed to large - scale magnetic fields we have to demand that the stochastic field satisfies @xmath333 if a magnetic field with smoothed amplitude @xmath334 is present before recombination the implication for the formation of magnetized structures are manifold .",
    "we recall that the value @xmath113 is the smoothed magnetic field redshifted at the epoch of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy . we know that , during collapse , the freezing of magnetic flux justifies the compressional amplification of the pre - existing field that will be boosted by roughly four orders of magnitude during the collapse @xcite .",
    "this will bring the amplitude of the field to the @xmath335 level .",
    "it is however premature to speculate on these issues .",
    "there are , at the moment , two important steps to be undertaken :    * the forthcoming planck explorer data will allow to strengthen the constraints derived in the present paper and , in particular , the formulae derived in the present section will allow to constraint directly the possible magnetized distortions stemming from the possible presence of large - scale magnetic fields ; * another precious set of informations may come from the analysis of the magnetic fields in clusters and superclusters ; it would be interesting to know , for instance , which is the spectral slope of the magnetic fields in galaxies , clusters and superclusters .",
    "the other interesting suggestion of the present analysis is that the inclusion of a large - scale magnetic field as a fit parameter in an extended @xmath16cdm model is definitely plausible .",
    "the @xmath16cdm model has been extended to include , after all , different possibilities like the ones arising in the dark - energy sector . here",
    "we have the possibility of adding the parameters of a magnetized background which are rather well justified on the physical ground .",
    "notice , in particular , that interesting degeneracies can be foreseen .",
    "for instance , the increase of the first peak caused by a decrease in the dark - matter fraction can be combined with the presence of a magnetic field whose effect , as we demonstrated , is to shift the first doppler peak upwards .",
    "these issues are beyond the scopes of the present paper .",
    "there are no compelling reasons why large - scale magnetic fields should not be present prior to recombination . in this paper , via a semi - analytical approach , the temperature autocorrelations induced by large - scale magnetic fields have been computed and confronted with the available experimental data . of course the data analysis can be enriched by combining the wmap data also with other data sets and by checking the corresponding effects of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the main spirit of this investigation was , however , not to discuss the analysis of data but to show that the effects of large - scale magnetic fields on the temperature autocorrelations can be brought at the same theoretical standard of the calculations that are usually performed in the absence of magnetic fields .    according to this perspective it is interesting to notice that , at the level of the pre - equality initial conditions , the presence of magnetic field induces a quasi - adiabatic mode .",
    "depending on the features of the magnetic spectrum ( i.e. its smoothed amplitude @xmath113 and its spectral slope @xmath227 ) , possible distortions of the first and second peaks can jeopardize the shape of the observed temperature autocorrelations .",
    "in particular , for sufficiently strong magnetic backgrounds ( i.e. @xmath336 and @xmath337 ) , the second peak turns into a hump . from the analysis of these distortions it was possible to derive a bound that depends solely upon measurable quantities such as the location of the first peak and its height .",
    "the derived formulae will allow a swifter comparison of the possible effects of large - scale magnetic fields with the forthcoming experimental data such as the ones of planck explorer .",
    "the available wmap data suggest that @xmath338 for @xmath339 .",
    "this range of parameters does not exclude that magnetic fields present prior to recombination could be the seeds of magnetized structures in the sky such as galaxies , clusters and superclusters .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the allowed range of parameters does not exclude the possibility that the magnetic field of galaxies is produced from the pre - recombination field even without a strong dynamo action whose possible drawbacks and virtues are , at present , a subject of very interesting debates .    in recent years",
    "cmb data have been confronted with a variety of cosmological scenarios that take as a pivotal model the @xmath16cdm paradigm .",
    "some of the parameters usually added encode informations stemming from effects that , even if extremely interesting , arise at very high energy and curvature scales .",
    "while it is certainly important to test any predictive cosmological scenario , we would like to stress that the purpose of the present work is , in some sense , more modest .",
    "we hope to learn from cmb not only what was the initial state of the universe when the hubble rate was only one millionth times smaller than the planck ( or string ) mass scale ; if possible we would like to learn from cmb how and why the largest magnetized structures arose in the sky .",
    "since we do see magnetic fields today it is definitely a well posed scientific question to know what were their effects prior to recombination .",
    "it would be desirable , for instance , to find clear evidence of the absence of pre - recombination magnetic fields . it would be equally exciting to determine the possible presence of this natural component .",
    "it is therefore opinion of the author that the inclusion of a magnetized component in future experimental studies of cmb observables represents a physically motivated option which we do hope will be seriously considered by the various collaborations which are today active in experimental cosmology .",
    "in this appendix the evolution equations of the magnetized curvature perturbations will be presented in the conformally newtonian gauge where the only two non vanishing components of the perturbed metric are @xmath340 where @xmath341 signifies the scalar nature of the fluctuation .",
    "while these equations are available in the literature @xcite , it seems appropriate to give here an explicit and reasonably self - contained treatment of some technical tools that constitute the basis of the results reported in the bulk of the paper .",
    "the magnetic fields are here treated in the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) approximation where the displacement current is neglected and where the three dynamical fields of the problem ( i.e. , respectively , the magnetic field , the ohmic electric field and the total ohmic current ) are all solenoidal . the bulk velocity field , in this approach , is given by the centre of mass velocity of the electron - proton system .",
    "this is physically justified since electrons and protons are strongly coupled by coulomb scattering . photons and baryon are also strongly coupled by thompson scattering , at least up to recombination which is the relevant time - scale for the effects of magnetic fields on temperature autocorrelations .",
    "the bulk velocity of the plasma can be separated into an irrotational part and into a rotational part which contributes to the evolution of the vector modes of the geometry @xcite . in the present investigation",
    "only the scalar modes are treated and , therefore , only the irrotational part of the velocity field will be relevant . in the mhd approach",
    "the magnetic fields enter , both , the perturbed einstein equations and the boltzmann hierarchy .",
    "the perturbed einstein equations are affected by the various components of the ( perturbed ) energy - momentum .",

    "notice that the mhd pointying vector has not been included in the momentum constraint .",
    "the rationale for this approximation stems from the fact that this contribution is proportional to @xmath353 and it contains one electric field which is suppressed , in mhd , by one power of @xmath354 , i.e. the ohmic conductivity .    in eq .",
