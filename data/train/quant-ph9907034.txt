    "in a gravitational - wave interferometer , the thermal noise of the mirrors has a similar effect as a gravitational wave since both change the optical path followed by the light in the interferometer arms .  at every radial point @xmath0 of the mirror surface",

    "we consider that the mirror is coated on the plane side of a segment of sphere of radius @xmath33 and of thickness @xmath34 ( see figure [ fig_model ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the mirror has a sharp edge on its circumference so that its mass @xmath35 and its diameter @xmath36 are related to @xmath33 and @xmath34 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the density of the substrate ( 2200 kg / m@xmath39 for silica ) .",

    "all the geometrical parameters of the mirrors ( curvature radius @xmath33 , diameter @xmath36 ) can then be expressed in terms of the thickness @xmath34 .",
    "if the thickness is much smaller than the curvature radius , the acoustic propagation equation can be solved using a paraxial approximation and one gets analytical expressions for the acoustic modes corresponding to gaussian modes@xcite . each compression mode",

    "these waists correspond to the beam waists on the front and end mirrors of the virgo  interferometer@xcite .",
    "one observes a decrease of the thermal noise for a thinner mirror .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the mechanical resonance frequencies are increased .",
    "it would be however difficult to use a very thin mirror since its diameter would become very large ( @xmath36 evolves as @xmath61 for small @xmath34 ) .",

    ". the internal thermal noise of a plano - convex mirror is thus significantly smaller , by at least a factor 4 .",
    "if the constraint on the diameter can be relaxed , even larger noise reduction may be obtained .",
    "we have checked the validity of the numerical calculation by plotting the effective susceptibility as a function of the number of computed modes , for example in the case of a thickness of 7 cm and an optical waist of 2 cm ( figure [ fig_precis ] ) .",
    "this curve shows that results become valid as soon as the number of computed modes is larger than 10@xmath69 .",
    "since the numerical calculation only deals with simple analytical expressions , it can easily be processed with a very large number of modes , such as 10@xmath70 .",
    "figure [ fig_waist ] shows the variation of the effective susceptibility as a function of the optical waist .",
    "the thermal noise is reduced for a wider waist .  the mirror displacement is actually averaged over the beam waist.since the maximum displacement is at the center of the mirror , one gets less noise for a wide waist .",
    "it is possible to derive a simple approximation of the thermal noise in the case of a thickness @xmath34 much smaller than the curvature radius @xmath33 .",
    "we can then assume that the transverse acoustic modes are degenerate and we can replace the resonance frequencies @xmath71 by the value for @xmath72 ( eq .  [ eq_onpl ] ) .  the sum over @xmath40 in the effective susceptibility ( eq .  [ eq_chieff0 ] ) is then a geometric sum and one gets a simple estimate of the susceptibility @xmath55 $ ] in terms of an optical mass @xmath73 given by@xcite @xmath74 & \\approx & 1/m_{opt}\\omega _",

    "\\label{eq_mopt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective susceptibility is thus equivalent to the one of a single harmonic oscillator of resonance frequency @xmath75 and of mass @xmath76 corresponding to the mass of the part of the mirror illuminated by the light beam ( term in brackets in eq .",
    "[ eq_mopt ] ) .",
    "the resulting susceptibility is shown as a dashed curve in figure [ fig_waist ] and appears to be a good approximation of the computed susceptibility .",
    "it is actually an overestimation of the effective susceptibility since the resonance frequencies @xmath71 are always larger than @xmath77 .",
    "this result shows that the internal thermal noise depends only on a few parameters , mainly the optical waist @xmath7 and the thickness @xmath34 .",
    "the effective susceptibility evolves as @xmath78 and one obtains a lower noise for a thin mirror and a wide optical waist , as shown in figures [ fig_thick ] and [ fig_waist ] .",
    "we have ckecked that the thermal noise is quite insensitive to other parameters such as the curvature radius @xmath33 or the mass @xmath35 of the mirror .",
    "we have computed the effective susceptibility for different masses by varying the curvature radius @xmath33 while the thickness @xmath34 is kept constant .",
    "the relative variation of the thermal noise is less than 5% for masses between 5 kg and 50 kg .",
    "note that this relation with the optical mass seems to be a specific behavior of the plano - convex geometry .",
    "one can define an effective mass for a cylindrical mirror by a relation similar to ( [ eq_chieffapprox ] ) but this mass is no longer related to the optical mass .  from the point of view of thermal noise",
    ", the comparison between cylindrical and plano - convex geometries shows that the effective mass of a cylindrical mirror is usually larger than the optical mass , whereas the fundamental resonance frequency @xmath79 is approximately 10  times larger for the plano - convex geometry ( typically 40 khz instead of 4 khz ) .",
    "this drastic increase of the fundamental frequency explains why the plano - convex mirror is less noisy .",
    "we now study the effect of a misalignment of the light beam .",
    "since the maximum thermal displacement is at the center of the mirror , moving the light beam off center must improve the noise .",
    "however , the number of modes ( @xmath80 ) which contributes to the thermal noise rapidly increases with the misalignment . as a consequence",
    "there is only a slight effect for cylindrical mirrors@xcite . in the case of a plano - convex mirror ,",
    "acoustic modes are more confined around the center of the mirror and one expects a larger effect of misalignment .    to efficiently compute the effective susceptibility",
    ", we replace the laguerre polynomial in eq .",
    "( [ eq_unpl ] ) by two hermite polynomials and we use the recurrence relations between them in the numerical calculation .  the resulting susceptibility is shown in figure [ fig_align ] , for a 7-cm thick mirror and for an optical waist of 2 cm ( curve _ a _ ) and of 5.5  cm ( curve _ b _ ) .",
    "the reduction of thermal noise with misalignment is clearly visible on those curves since a reduction factor on the order of 2 can be reached .",
    "we have studied the internal thermal noise at low frequency of a plano - convex mirror . we have shown that it can be related to the susceptibility of an equivalent pendulum of resonance frequency equal to the fundamental resonance frequency of the mirror and of mass equal to the optical mass .  as a consequence",
    "the thermal noise mainly depends on the thickness of the mirror and on the waist of the light beam .",
    "we have found that a thin plano - convex mirror has a lower noise than a standard cylindrical mirror of same mass . for a 7-cm thickness ,",
    "the thermal noise is approximately 10  times lower .",
    "using such plano - convex mirrors in gravitational - wave interferometers would thus increase the sensitivity of the interferometer in the intermediate frequency domain .",
    "the results derived in this paper are based on a paraxial approximation which allows to describe the acoustic modes of the mirror as gaussian modes .",
    "this approximation is valid if the diameter and the curvature radius of the mirror are large as compared to its thickness and to the optical waist .",
    "otherwise , high - order transverse modes may become sensitive to edge effects and they may be not adequately described as gaussian modes .",
    "these modes however do not significantly contribute to the thermal noise since the overlap with light becomes small for high - order modes . anyway , considering the large noise reduction that would be obtained by a simple change of the mirror shape , we believe that it would be of great interest to experimentally compare the background thermal noises of cylindrical and plano - convex mirrors , for example by using a high - sensitivity displacement sensor such as a high - finesse cavity@xcite",
    ".    finally , let us note that we have studied a geometry with a sharp edge on the circumference .  since the acoustic modes are confined near the center of the mirror , it is possible to truncate the borders of the mirror in order to have an edge with a finite size .",
    "this would not degrade the thermal characteristics of the mirror , but it will change its diameter and its mass . a compromise must be found in practice between the thickness which determines the amplitude of internal noise , the mass which is important for suspension thermal noise , and the diameter of the mirror ."
