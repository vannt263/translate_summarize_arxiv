    "an rna sequence is described by its primary structure , a linear oriented sequence of the nucleotides and can be viewed as a string over the alphabet @xmath1 .",

    "the secondary structure encodes this bonding information of the nucleotides irrespective of the actual spacial embedding .",
    "more than three decades ago , waterman and colleagues pioneered the combinatorics and prediction of rna secondary structures  @xcite . represented as a _ diagram _ by drawing its sequence on a horizontal line and each base pair as an arc in the upper half - plane ,",
    "rna secondary structure contains no crossing arcs ( two arcs @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross if the nucleotides appear in the order @xmath4 in the primary structure ) .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that there exist cross - serial interactions , called pseudoknots in rna  @xcite , see fig .  [",

    "rna evolution experiments have produced pseudoknotted rna families , when binding hiv-1 reverse transcriptase  @xcite .    however , little is known w.r.t .  their basic statistical properties .",
    "in order to be able to identify biological features this paper establishes the `` base line '' by studying random rna pseudoknot structures .",
    "basic questions here are for instance how the statistics of hairpin- , interior- and multi - loops change in the context of cross - serial bonds and to study new features as h - loops and kissing hairpins .    the key to organize and filter structures with cross - serial interactions is to introduce topology .",
    "the idea is simple : instead of drawing a structure in the plane ( sphere ) we draw it on more sophisticated orientable surfaces .",
    "the advantage of this is that this presentation allows to eliminate any cross - serial interactions .",
    "rna secondary structure fits seamlessly into this framework , since these are exactly topological structures of genus zero , i.e.  structures that can be drawn on a sphere without crossings .",
    "the topology of rna structures has first been studied in  @xcite and the classification and expansion of rna structures including pseudoknots in terms of the topological genus of an associated fatgraph via matrix theory in  @xcite .",

    "recently ,  @xcite introduce a stochastic context - free grammar ( scfg ) facilitating the efficient boltzmann - sampling of rna pseudoknotted structures .",
    "an rna pseudoknotted structure is modeled by augmenting the notion of a graph , as an orientable fatgraph .",
    "this is obtained by replacing vertices by discs and edges by ribbons in the diagram representation .",
    "gluing the sides of these ribbons , creates a closed , orientable surface of genus @xmath5 , which is a connected sum of @xmath5 tori ( see section  [ s : back ] ) .",
    "as topological genus completely characterizes any closed , orientable surface  @xcite , rna structures are filtered by just one parameter , the genus of their associated fatgraphs and rna secondary structures are exactly structures of genus zero .",
    "the genus of a structure is not affected by removing noncrossing arcs or collapsing a stack into a singleton .",

    "a shape can be constructed by nesting and concatenating irreducible shadows .",
    "the generating function of irreducible shadows is computed in  @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper we study properties of topological rna structures , i.e.  rna contact structures with cross - serial interactions that are filtered by their topological genus . </S>",
    "<S> rna secondary structures within this framework are topological structures having genus zero . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a new bivariate generating function whose singular expansion allows us to analyze the distributions of arcs , stacks , hairpin- , interior- and multi - loops . </S>",
    "<S> we then extend this analysis to h - type pseudoknots , kissing hairpins as well as @xmath0-knots and compute their respective expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss our results and put them into context with data obtained by uniform sampling structures of fixed genus . </S>"
