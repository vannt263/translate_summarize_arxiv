    "in september 2013 , we stumbled upon networks generated by finitely many maps @xmath0 on a ring @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the rule is that two different points @xmath2 in @xmath1 are connected if there is a map @xmath0 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "some constructions of finite simple graphs can be seen below in this document .",
    "the idea is based on the old concept of * cayley graphs * which visualizes finitely presented groups equipped with finitely many generators @xmath5 on groups . for a single transformation @xmath6 on a ring @xmath1 , one has a dynamical system : @xmath7 .",
    "the networks visualize the orbit structure of these systems if we think of the monoid generated by @xmath6 as  time \" .",
    "we disregard here however the digraph structure , self - loops and multiple connections and look at finite simple graphs only . as in complex dynamics , where the simplest polynomial maps already produce a rich variety of fractals , the discrete structures can be complex .",
    "the maps @xmath0 on the ring do not have to be algebraic , they could be any permutation on a finite set .",
    "one can see these networks as graph homomorphic images of cayley graphs generated by the transformations in the permutation groups of the vertex set .",
    "an other motivation comes from dynamical systems theory : since a computer always simulates a system on a finite set , it is interesting to see what the relation between this discrete and continuum is .",
    "the relation between the continuum and arithmetic systems have been investigated for example in @xcite ; a dynamical system like @xmath8 on the interval @xmath9 $ ] is realized on the computer as a map on a finite set leading to finitely many cyclic attractors . for two or more maps ,",
    "this can become a rather complex and geometric network .",
    "+ the fact that simple polynomial maps produce arithmetic chaos is exploited by * pseudo random number generators*. there is a mild justification in that random variables like @xmath10 are asymptotically independent @xcite on @xmath11 in the limit @xmath12 . while the pseudo random nature given by the quadratic map @xmath11 is unclear , the orbits are sufficiently random to be exploited or example in the  pollard rho method \" for integer factorization @xcite .",
    "maps like @xmath13 modulo @xmath14 or cellular automata maps were visualized in @xcite using state transition digraphs .",
    "+ what is new ?",
    "by allowing more transformations , we can get more structure and more variety .",
    "our point of view is motivated heavily from the study of deterministic and random networks .",
    "the generalization from groups to monoids and by looking at the state space instead of the group itself , we break symmetries : while cayley graphs look more like rigid crystals , the monoid graphs tend to produce rather organic structures resembling networks we see in social networks , computer networks , synapses , chemical or biological networks and especially in peer to peer networks .",
    "this happens already in the simplest cases : we can for example take quadratic maps @xmath15 or affine maps like @xmath16 and @xmath17 on @xmath11 . whether we take affine , or nonlinear or arithmetic functions , the networks obtained in such a dynamical way can be intriguing : + * a ) * the dynamical graphs show * visually interesting structures * which bring arithmetic relations to live . * b ) * their * statistical properties * of path length , global cluster and vertex degree are interesting .",

    "are two experimental observations : + * a ) * ( @xcite ) we measure that the mean length @xmath18 and the global clustering coefficient @xmath19 have the property that @xmath20 often has a compact limit set if the number of nodes go to infinity .",
    "when choosing random permutations and averaging , we see actual convergence in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "the two quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19 are essential to see small world phenomena as seen in @xcite .",
    "a reasonable conjecture is that in the probability space of all pairs of random permutations @xmath21 on @xmath11 , the random variable @xmath22 has an expectation which converges for @xmath12 .",
    "there is strong numerical evidence for that . in @xcite",
    "we also showed how one can naturally construct large bipartite or multipartite graphs using dynamical constructions .",
    "+ * b ) * ( @xcite ) we get deterministic examples of networks which feature all the statistical properties of watts - strogatz @xcite in the sense that @xmath23 and vertex distributions behave in the same way .",
    "the statistic is almost indistinguishable from w - s .",
    "these examples are of the form @xmath24 $ ] , where at least one @xmath25 is @xmath26 and the others are equal to @xmath14 , a permutation parameter . for @xmath27 and @xmath28 maps , we have the initial wiring setup of watts - strogatz for @xmath29 . while in watts - strogatz",

    "+ in this paper , we prove a couple of elementary which indicate how these graphs can relate to elementary number theory .",
    "to do so , we have questions from dynamical systems as a guide .",
    "the subject of networks has exploded in the last decade , as a look onto the library shows @xcite .",
    "it has been made accessible to a larger audience in books like @xcite .",
    "+ the topics in the next sections are in an obvious way motivated from corresponding problems in complex dynamics , where the question of connectivity and dimension of the julia sets is of interest .",
    "one can also look at the analogue of the mandelbrot set , the set of parameters for which graphs are connected .",
    "if we have a class of dynamically generated graphs , we can ask how the clique size is distributed on the parameter space . as in dynamical system terminology",

    "this example is inspired by the famous collatz @xmath123 problem , a `` prototypical example of an extremely simple to state , extremely hard to solve , problem '' to cite @xcite .",

    "the graphs look surprisingly random .",
    "it is the non - commutativity of the monoid generated by @xmath127 as well as the conditional application of these two maps which makes the original collatz problem difficult .",

    "we see experimentally that all networks @xmath129 on @xmath41 generated by the dynamical system @xmath130 are connected .",

    "we appear to have connectivity for all primes .",
    "+ the connectivity question can be seen as a non - commutative chinese remainder theorem problem because we want to solve @xmath136 . in the commutative case , this reduces to @xmath137 .",
    "an example is @xmath138 and @xmath139 where the maps commute .",
    "it is enough to assure that for every @xmath3 we can find @xmath140 such that @xmath141 . if either @xmath49 or @xmath82 is a primitive root of unity , then @xmath142 and we have the problem to solve @xmath143 , which is no problem already for @xmath144 . + here is an amusing fact for collatz networks :    all collatz networks @xmath145 have exactly @xmath78 triangles if @xmath33 is prime and larger than @xmath146 .    since @xmath147 is a field",

    "? it can be subtle for @xmath91 already , where we can see different numbers of triangles .",
    "+ the statistics of the collatz networks on @xmath11 generated by @xmath176 is typical among other dynamical networks .",
    "we see that the mean path length - mean cluster coefficient relation @xmath177 converges for @xmath12 .",
    "the dimension of the collatz graphs converges to @xmath95 for @xmath12 as the number of triangles are rare .",
    "it would be nice to know the exact number of triangles in the general case ( not only for primes ) .",

    "we can now play with other graphs like graphs generated by @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "as the dickson dynamical system illustrates , questions involving the iteration of arithmetic functions can be difficult .",
    "the oldest known open problem in mathematics is related to it .",
    "one of the simplest nonlinear cases with two dimensional time is @xmath182 and @xmath183 on @xmath11 .",
    "this is a case where the monoid is commutative .",
    "one can ask , for which @xmath33 , the graph on @xmath184 generated by @xmath185 is connected .",
    "this can be answered because @xmath182 and @xmath186 commute .",
