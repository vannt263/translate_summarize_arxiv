    "having reached its one hundredth anniversary the theory of relativity has become a cornerstone of modern physics .",
    "one of the earliest challenges to this theory was the clock paradox or twin paradox .",
    "while this paradox has long been resolved it remains an excellent vehicle for the study of relativity and in particular of the relationship between special and general relativity .",
    "the clock paradox is described by a _",
    "gedanken _ experiment using identical twins with the first twin remaining at home and the second twin accelerating away and later returning . in order to describe a physically realistic trip",
    "the accelerating twin s journey will consist of four legs . during the first leg",
    "the twin travels in a space vehicle at a constant acceleration towards a distant star .",
    "the second leg begins where the traveling twin reverses thrust with constant deceleration .",

    "the stay at home twin is moving in a static and homogeneous gravitational field ( shf ) .",
    "the equations of motion for a freely falling clock in this shf , can be solved in terms of the coordinate distance of the accelerated twin for both leg 1 and 2 of the out going trip . with the destination distance in the shf as a parameter",
    ", the two solutions can then be connected to obtain the elapsed time for a complete trip . using coordinate distance as the parameter a coordinate transformation to a lorentz inertial frame",
    "makes it possible to evaluate elapsed times and distances for realistic trips to the stars .",
    "following einstein s development of the equivalence principle@xcite@xcite the acceleration experienced by the traveling twin is indistinguishable from station keeping ( remaining motionless ) in a gravitational field . from this perspective",
    "the traveling twin is station keeping while the stay at home twin falls freely in the field .",
    "consider an orthogonal coordinate system with the gravitational field parallel to the @xmath0-axis . during the first and forth legs of the trip the field points in the negative direction . during the second and third legs the field",

    "the metric of a homogeneous field will be static and unchanged by coordinate transformations in any plane perpendicular to the acceleration . under these conditions",
    "all derivatives in the field equations are zero except those parallel to the acceleration ( @xmath0 axis ) .",
    "this allows the metric for a shf to be written in the form ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the proper time ( time on a freely falling clock ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the coordinate time and spatial coordinates of the station keeping twin .",

    "two examples that exist in the literature are illustrated in the lass@xcite line element    @xmath21    and the rindler@xcite line element    @xmath22    these line elements describe the special case in which motion occurs parallel to the @xmath0-axis only . due to the invariance of proper time any metric consistent with eq .",

    "( [ 18 ] ) to obtain    @xmath35    it is noteworthy that this solution to the field equations has a vanishing riemann tensor as shown by desloge@xcite .",
    "this vanishing of the riemann tensor would be expected from the symmetry of the rindler line element@xcite , which is indistinguishable from a 2-dimensional problem , and following weinberg@xcite can not be associated with a  true gravitational field  . from physical considerations",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since there can be no physically real source for a homogeneous gravitational field .",
    "in order to calculate the full round - trip time the equations of motion for the second leg must be obtained .",

    "( [ 27 ] ) are mathematically equal due to a hyperbolic functional identity .",
    "the return trip time is equal to the outbound trip time because there is a one - to - one correspondence between velocity and position for the outbound and inbound trips , thus the total round - trip time is twice these values .",
    "the _ gedanken _ experiment of the clock paradox can also be solved within the formalism of special relativity@xcite@xcite . following misner et al@xcite",
    "assign to the accelerating twin a 4-space velocity @xmath44 and 4-space acceleration @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 or in terms of our dimensionless parameters @xmath48 .",
    "the invariance of the square of the 4-space acceleration and the orthogonality of the 4-space velocity and 4-space acceleration @xmath49 leads to a set of differential equations with solution    @xmath50    and    @xmath51    capital letters are used for the coordinates to distinguish these from the general relativity solution .",
