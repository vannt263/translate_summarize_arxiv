    "representing about 90% of the agn population , the presence of rapid x - ray flux variations and iron emission line ( fe k@xmath2 ) indicates that most of the soft x - ray emission originates from the accretion disk @xcite . in radio - loud agn ,",

    "the doppler boosted continuum emission from the relativistic jet may dominate at all energies in bl lacs ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , suggesting that the continuum variability in radio - loud agn is related to both the jet and the instabilities of accretion - disk flows @xcite . in radio - loud quasars ,",

    "the emission from accretion disk or hot corona can be hidden by an obscuring torus , and hence , the bulk of the optical continuum and broad - line emission in radio galaxies can be attributed to the relativistic jet rather than the central engine if the boosted jet - emission is still strong , i.e. the jet is intrinsically luminous and highly relativistic .",
