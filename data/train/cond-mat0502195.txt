    "our present analysis of the binary disordered case raises the question of the dependence of the critical behavior on the disorder distribution .",
    "indeed , we have obtained that the critical loop distribution @xmath203 varies continuously with the dilution fraction @xmath22 of the binary distribution .",
    "more generally , we might expect that @xmath203 could depend upon the disorder distribution itself .",
    "if this is the case , do the critical exponents differ from those of the binary case ?",
    "since the example of gaussian disorder @xcite has been interpreted in terms of essential singularities of the kosterlitz - thouless type , we intend to study other types of disorder distributions to clarify this issue .",
    "another interesting direction concerns the effect of disorder when the a priori loop entropy ( [ asymp ] ) in the poland - scheraga formulation has an exponent @xmath269 , in which case the pure transition is first - order @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the context of the dna denaturation transition , the binding transition between two pure self - avoiding chains on a cubic lattice was found to be first order @xcite .",
    "the theoretical explanation that has been proposed @xcite , is that the self - avoidance constraint between denaturated loops and the rest of the chain actually induces an exponent @xmath269 for the loop weight ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "the value @xmath270 has been since measured in monte - carlo simulations @xcite . in the future",
    ", we hope to apply our method to the disordered poland - scheraga model for the case @xmath269 , and to compare with the results recently obtained by b. coluzzi @xcite via monte - carlo simulations of self avoiding walks .",

    "<S> our study is based on the statistics of loops between two contacts with the substrate , from which we define binder - like parameters : their crossings for various sizes @xmath4 allow a precise determination of the critical temperature , and their finite size properties yields a crossover exponent @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyse at criticality the distribution of loop length @xmath6 in both regimes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as the finite - size properties of the contact density and energy . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that the critical exponents for the thermodynamics are the same as those of the pure case , except for strong logarithmic corrections to scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these logarithmic corrections in the thermodynamics is related to a disorder - dependent logarithmic singularity that appears in the critical loop distribution in the rescaled variable @xmath9 as @xmath10 . </S>"
