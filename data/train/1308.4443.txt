    "a key goal for observational studies of galaxy formation has been to build a complete picture of star formation over cosmic time .",
    "much of the effort in the last two decades has been focused on tracers in two distinct wavelength ranges : the near - to - far ultraviolet ( uv ) and the far - infrared / submm .",
    "these wavelengths are excellent tracers of star formation in distant galaxies ; the uv continuum originates primarily from massive , short - lived stars , and the far - infrared ( ir ) from dust that envelops star forming regions and re - processes this uv continuum .    despite this close physical connection ,",
    "these tracers have so far offered somewhat different views of the high redshift ( @xmath15 ) universe .",
    "star - forming galaxies identified in the rest - frame uv are numerous , with moderate star - formation rates ( sfrs @xmath16m@xmath9yr@xmath17 ; madau et al .  1996 ; reddy et al .",
    "2006 ) while those detected in the submm ( submm galaxies ; smgs ) are rarer ( by a factor of around @xmath18 in surface density ) and have extremely high sfrs ( @xmath19@xmath20m@xmath9yr@xmath17 ; smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; barger et al .  1998 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; chapman et al .  2005 ; michaowski , hjorth & watson 2010 ) .",
    "traditionally , these disparate properties have been interpreted as a natural extension of the behaviour seen in the local universe , where uv - bright galaxies are common and typically star - forming disks , while the most ir - luminous galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath21 ) are rare and mostly the result of major mergers ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "farrah et al .  2001 )    in recent years it has become clear that this single definition for smgs can not be completely accurate . while some smgs are associated with merger events ( e.g.  swinbank et al .  2009 ;",
    "alaghband - zadeh et al .  2012 ) , it appears that a significant fraction of smgs have disk - like morphologies ( targett et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "however , morphological studies of galaxies in the distant universe require high resolution and sensitivity , restricting the size of samples studied in this way , and are difficult to interpret given the redshift ( k - correction ) and other selection effects .",
    "meanwhile , the role of smgs in galaxy formation has been brought into focus by the emerging notion of a so - called `` main sequence '' for star forming galaxies .",
    "large - scale studies of uv - selected samples have shown that , for a given redshift , the ratio of the sfr to the stellar mass ( often referred to as the specific sfr ) is roughly constant ( noeske et al .  2007 ;",
    "elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ; daddi et al .  2007 ; karim et al .",
    "this main - sequence has been taken as strong evidence of in - situ star formation ( as opposed to mergers ) being the dominant process in building stellar mass in galaxies at @xmath15 ( rodighiero et al .",
    "2011 ) , as mergers are thought to greatly enhance the specific sfr ( e.g. mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "the specific star formation rate of smgs has thus become of much interest , with variations in stellar mass estimates leading to opposing claims of smgs lying off ( hainline et al .",
    "2011 ) and on the main sequence ( michaowski et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "interestingly , simulations of galaxies at @xmath22 suggest that this dichotomous behaviour is to be expected , as the typical sensitivity and beam size of submm surveys ( e.g.  shades , less ; @xmath23mjy ; mortier et al .",
    "2005 ; weiss et al .",
    "2009 ) is such that they should be sensitive to both merger - induced starbursts and the massive end of the star - forming disk population ( hayward et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "thus , while smgs may not form a single homogenous population , submm surveys are able to trace the most highly star forming galaxies at @xmath22 in a way not currently possible at other wavelengths . with the advent of _ herschel_(pilbratt et al . 2010 ) , large scale ( @xmath24deg.@xmath2 ) multi - band submm surveys have become possible for the first time ( e.g hermes , h - atlas ; oliver et al .  2012 ; eales et al .",
    "the scientific yield from these surveys has been revolutionary in two ways .",
    "firstly , the massive increase in survey volume ( from increases in both depth and area ) over existing submm datasets has produced a significant leap in our knowledge of the aggregate properties of the submm population , e.g. their number density ( oliver et al .",
    "2010 ; clements et al .",
    "2010 ; glenn et al .",
    "2010 ; bthermin et al .",
    "2011 , 2012a ) and clustering properties ( cooray et al .  2010 ; maddox et al .  2010",
    "; amblard et al .  2011 ;",
    "viero et al .  2012 ; van kampen et al .",
    "secondly , the multi - band nature of the _ herschel _ data , with six far - ir / submm bands covering the observed frame 70500@xmath5 m range , has meant that the physical information contained in the far - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be probed for the first time ( e.g. elbaz et al .",
    "2010 ; hwang et al .",
    "2010 ; magdis et al .  2010",
    "; smith et al .  2012a ; symeonidis et al .  2013 ) .",
    "however , the interpretation of the _ herschel _ data sets has been hampered by the large beam size of _ herschel _ at submm wavelengths ( @xmath25 arcsec ) .",
    "the resulting confusion noise ( @xmath266mjy 1@xmath1 ; nguyen et al .",
    "2010 ) for spire imaging has meant that for the faintest spire sources ( i.e. @xmath27mjy ) both accurate cross - identifications and flux densities require the use of ancillary data at ir or radio wavelengths ( e.g. roseboom et al .",
    "2010 ; 2012a ) .",
    "this dependence on ancillary data has meant that the _ herschel _ surveys have struggled to significantly increase the observable parameter space , in terms of @xmath13@xmath28 , for ir galaxies .    while alma will eventually produce deep , high resolution , blank field submm imaging , its limited field of view ( @xmath29 arcmin at 450@xmath5 m ) means that even moderately wide - area surveys ( e.g. @xmath30arcmin.@xmath2 ) would be very observationally expensive .",
    "for this reason , scuba-2 on the 15-m jcmt occupies a unique niche in submm imaging capability ( holland et al .",
    "2013 ) . with a mapping speed more than @xmath31 faster than the original scuba and a beam size of @xmath32 arcsec at 450@xmath5 m , scuba-2 offers for the first time both the sensitivity and angular resolution required to perform sensitive studies of individual galaxies at @xmath15 without concerns about source confusion .",
    "the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey ( s2cls ) is the largest programme that will be undertaken with scuba-2 , aiming to map @xmath33 deg.@xmath2 of the best extragalactic survey fields at 450 ( 850 ) @xmath5 m to a depth of @xmath34mjy .",
    "twelve months of s2cls observing , equating to over @xmath19hrs on - sky , have now been obtained , with the first results on the deep number counts at 450@xmath5 m presented by geach et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . here",

    "finally , we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout",

    "all sfr and stellar mass estimates presented assume , or have been converted to , a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "the starting point for this study is the 450 and 850@xmath5 m imaging taken as part of the s2cls in the deep extragalactic cosmos and uds fields .",
    "observations were taken with scuba-2 on the 15-m jcmt between october 2011 and july 2012 .",
    "for these deep fields only the best observing conditions were used , i.e. @xmath39 . the standard `` daisy '' mapping pattern ( holland et al .",
    "2013 ) was used , with observations broken into 30min scans .",
    "all data are reduced using the smurf package v1.4.0 ( chapin et al .",
    "the default `` blank field '' configuration was used , although with the fourier filtering increased to 1.3hz ( equivalent to 120 arcsec at the scuba-2 scan rate ) .",
    "flux calibration between pw and jy is performed using the scuba-2 flux calibration factors ( fcfs ) appropriate for this version of smurf ; 606jypw@xmath17beam@xmath17 for 450@xmath0 m and 556jypw@xmath17beam@xmath17 for 850@xmath0 m",
    "( dempsey et al .  2013 ) .",
    "table [ tab : clsobs ] details the number of scans taken in each field and the corresponding depths .",
    "noise - only maps of our scuba-2 images are produced from the data themselves , by inverting a random half of the individual scans before combining ( austermann et al .",
    "2010 ; weiss et al .",
    "these noise - only maps are used to estimate the completeness and reliability for our source detection algorithm .",
    ".details of deep scuba-2 cls fields used in this paper . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the likelihood is estimated via use of the @xmath40 statistic .",
    "ten parallel mcmc chains are run , with convergence checks performed every 400 iterations , after an initial burn - in of 2000 iterations .",
    "convergence is assessed using the method of gelman & rubin ( 1992 ) .",
    "after convergence is achieved a further 2000 iterations are performed , with inference performed on the last 2200 iterations from each chain .",
    "as multi - wavelength coverage of extra - galactic survey fields has become common - place , the practice of stacking images based on a selection at another , potentially deeper , wavelength has become popular .",
    "however , a major difficulty in this approach is the mis - matched resolution between data sets , e.g. the optical and submm datasets used in this work have angular resolutions that are different by a factor of roughly @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the `` raw '' stacked signal ( i.e. just the pixels combined together ) may not only contain signal from the sources in the input list , but also those that are correlated spatially with them .",
    "it is important to note that the corruption of the stacking signal is solely due to these correlations ; if galaxies were purely poisson distributed then simply measuring the co - variance between the pixels coincident with sources would give an unbiased estimate of their mean flux density ( e.g.  marsden et al .",
    "2009 ) .    recently",
    ", a number of authors have presented methods to deal with these correlations .",
    "bthermin et al .",
    "( 2012a ) use a traditional stacking method , but correct for the clustering signal via the use of simulations .",
    "meanwhile kurczynski & gawiser ( 2010 ; kg10 ) offer an approach which uses linear algebra to account for the correlations between sources in the input list .",
    "other methodologies exist but mainly fall into these two categories .",
    "both of these methods have significant drawbacks . in principle",
    "the bthermin et al .",
    "( 2012a ) method can completely correct for the clustered signal , but it requires perfect knowledge of the clustering properties of the galaxies in the stacking list , something which is difficult to obtain given that we know clustering is a function of intrinsic galaxy properties ( e.g. star formation rate , stellar mass , morphology , etc ) .",
    "the kg10 approach again offers the ability to completely correct the estimates , but this time requires the stacking input list to be complete ; only correlations with galaxies in the input list can be taken into account .",
    "thus the two approaches suit different applications ; if the source list to be stacked is incomplete but homogeneous then the first approach is better , if it is quite complete but potentially heterogenous then the second approach should be used .    as an aside , a small number of papers have suggested that the best method to remove correlations is to fit for bright sources and then stack `` source - free '' maps ( e.g. chary , cooray & sullivan 2008 ) .",
    "however , this approach requires perfect knowledge of the source photometry , otherwise it is likely to introduce artifacts that can become significant if correlations between the bright sources and faint stacking list exist .      to begin , we assume that the prf is circularly symmetric and so can be described in one dimension as a function of the radial distance from the source position .",
    "this assumption is for simplicity and to reduce the computational expense of the stacking calculation ; all the following formalism can be easily expanded to consider the full 2d stacked image . for a 1d stack the flux density for a single source @xmath41 at a distance @xmath42 is given by ,    @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the image , and the sum runs over the @xmath45 pixels that lie at a separation @xmath42 from the source position .",
    "it is clear that the simplest 1d stack for a list of source positions @xmath46 is then , @xmath47    if image pixels in @xmath44 appear more than once in the summation then this estimation for the stacked 1d source profile will be biased , giving erroneously high values of @xmath48 and broader source profiles . to correct this we need to include information about the correlations between the pixels to be stacked .",
    "we can re - write the above equation in matrix notation as ,      where @xmath50 is a @xmath51 matrix which contains the value @xmath52 at the pixel coordinate that corresponds to a source @xmath41 and separation @xmath42 . for a source list without correlations ,",
    "the columns of @xmath50 would contain at most one non - zero value .",
    "this means that for an uncorrelated source list @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the identity matrix .",
    "if correlations between sources in the list exist then @xmath55 will be a symmetric matrix that describes these correlations .",
    "thus it can be shown that an unbiased estimate of the mean 1d profile is given by      letting @xmath57 and @xmath58 , this is now a linear equation of the form @xmath59 , which can be solved efficiently via conjugate gradient methods ( as the matrix @xmath60 is non - negative and symmetric ) . in this formalism @xmath61",
    "can be interpreted as the `` naive stack '' i.e. the stack we would get by simply adding up the pixel flux from the map for each source , while @xmath60 is the fisher information matrix . measurement errors in the image can be included naturally by re - writing @xmath60 and @xmath61 as , @xmath62    for stacking to give interpretable results the source lists that go into the stack must be reasonably homogenous .",
    "this creates a tension with our desire to stack as complete a sample as possible to account for all the correlations that may be present .",
    "fortunately the stacking methodology can be expanded so that any number of independent source lists can be stacked simultaneously to account for the correlations both within lists and between them .",
    "assuming now we have a set of source positions to be stacked @xmath63 , we can create matrices @xmath64 that map the @xmath44 into these @xmath65 stacks",
    ". we can then re - write eq .",
