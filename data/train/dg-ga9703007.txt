    "the goal of this paper is to understand representation varieties of artin and shephard groups and thereby obtain information on serre s problem of determining which finitely - presented groups are fundamental groups of smooth complex ( not necessarily compact ) algebraic varieties .",
    "the first examples of finitely - presented groups which are not fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties were given by j.  morgan @xcite , @xcite . we find a new class of such examples which consists of certain artin and shephard groups .",
    "since all artin and shephard groups have quadratically presented malcev algebras , morgan s test does not suffice to distinguish artin groups from fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties or even from fundamental groups of compact khler manifolds , see  [ completion ] .",
    "our main results are the following theorems ( artin and shephard groups are defined in  [ groups ] below ) :    [ moremorgan ] there are infinitely many distinct artin groups that are not isomorphic to fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties .",
    "[ morereps ] for any affine variety @xmath0 defined over @xmath1 there are shephard and artin groups @xmath2 such that a zariski open subset @xmath3 of @xmath0 is biregular isomorphic to zariski open subsets of the character varieties @xmath4 . the subset @xmath3 contains all real points of @xmath0 .",
    "the surprising thing about theorem [ moremorgan ] is that artin groups look very similar to the fundamental groups of smooth complex quasi - projective varieties .",
    "for example the free group on @xmath5 letters is the fundamental group of @xmath6 with @xmath5 points removed and it is the artin group associated with the graph with @xmath5 vertices and no edges . on the other extreme ,",
    "take a finite complete graph where each edge has the label @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding artin group is free abelian , hence it is the fundamental group of the quasi - projective variety @xmath8 .",
    "yet another example is the braid group which is the artin group associated with the permutation group @xmath9 .",
    "theorem [ moremorgan ] is a consequence of theorems [ moremnev ] , [ t3 ] , [ t4 ] , [ t6 ] , [ t7 ] and corollary [ c5 ] below .",
    "the main body of this paper is concerned with a study of the following diagram :    @xmath10    the arrow @xmath11 is tautological , the arrow @xmath12 is pull - back . the arrows @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined below . in   [ abstract arrangements ] , [ projective arrangements ] we define _ abstract arrangements _ ( essentially bipartite graphs ) and their projective realizations .",
    "the space @xmath15 of projective realizations of a given abstract arrangement has a canonical structure of a projective variety ( i.e. projective scheme , see the preceeding footnote ) over @xmath1 .",
    "in fact we refine the notion of projective arrangement to obtain the affine variety @xmath16 of _ finite based realizations_. the variety @xmath16 injects as an open subvariety into the _ moduli space",
    "_ @xmath17 of the arrangement @xmath18 .",
    "our version of mnev s theorem @xcite is then    [ moremnev ] for any affine algebraic variety @xmath0 defined over @xmath1 there is a marked based abstract arrangement @xmath18 such that the varieties @xmath16 , @xmath0 are isomorphic .",
    "it appears that mnev s theorem @xcite implies only that there is a stable homeomorphism between the sets of real points of @xmath16 and @xmath0 .",
    "in addition mnev gives only an outline of the proof .",
    "for our application to serre s problem it is critical to prove an isomorphism on the scheme level .",
    "the key idea in proving theorem [ moremnev ] is to construct a cross - section @xmath13 to @xmath11 ( over the category of affine varieties ) by showing that one can do `` algebra via geometry '' , that is one can describe elementary algebraic operations over any commutative ring using projective arrangements ( see  [ algebraic operations ] ) .",
    "this idea actually goes back to the work of von staudt @xcite ( the `` fundamental theorem of the projective geometry '' ) .",
    "the abstract arrangement @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath0 under @xmath13 depends upon a choice of affine embedding @xmath19 ( i.e. defining equations ) for @xmath0 and upon a choice of particular formulae describing these equations .",
    "moreover we obtain isomorphism @xmath20 of affine schemes over @xmath1 .",
    "we will abuse notation and use @xmath13 to denote this isomorphism as well .",
    "thus the symbol @xmath13 has two meanings : @xmath21 is the arrangement determined by the above data , but if @xmath22 then @xmath23 is a point in @xmath16 .",
    "the meaning to be assigned to @xmath24 will be clear from its argument .",
    "we make analogous abuses of notation with mappings @xmath11 and @xmath14 below .",
    "the arrow _ alg _ encodes the points and lines of an _ anisotropic projective realization _",
    "( see  [ s14 ] for the definition ) @xmath25 of the abstract arrangement @xmath18 into a representation @xmath26 of the shephard group @xmath27 associated to the abstract arrangement @xmath18 .",
    "a choice of a nondegenerate bilinear form on @xmath28 determines anisotropic points and lines in @xmath29 ( we choose the bilinear form so that all real points of @xmath29 are anisotropic ) . each anisotropic point in @xmath29 determines the cartan involution in @xmath30 around this point or the rotation of order @xmath31 having this point as neutral fixed point ( i.e. a fixed point where the differential of the rotation has determinant 1 ) .",
    "there are two such rotations of order @xmath31 , we choose one of them .",
    "similarly every anisotropic line @xmath32 uniquely determines the reflection in @xmath30 which keeps @xmath32 pointwise fixed .",
    "finally one can encode the incidence relation between points and lines in @xmath29 using algebra : two involutions generate the subgroup @xmath33 in @xmath34 iff the neutral fixed point of one belongs to the fixed line of the other , rotations of orders @xmath7 and @xmath31 anticommute iff the neutral fixed point of the rotation of order @xmath31 belongs to the fixed line of the involution , etc .",
    "we get a morphism @xmath35 in the following theorem we shall identify @xmath36 with its projection to the character variety @xmath37    [ t3 ] the mapping @xmath38 is a biregular isomorphism onto a zariski open ( and closed ) subvariety @xmath39 .",
    "the mapping @xmath14 has the following important property : let @xmath0 be an affine variety defined over @xmath1 and @xmath40 be a rational point .",
    "then we can choose an arrangement @xmath18 so that @xmath41 corresponds to a realization @xmath42 under the mapping @xmath43 such that the image of the representation @xmath44 is a finite subgroup of @xmath34 with trivial centralizer .",
    "there is an artin group @xmath45 and a canonical epimorphism @xmath46 associated with the shephard group @xmath27 .",
    "it remains to examine the morphism @xmath47 given by pull - back of homomorphisms .",
    "[ t4 ] suppose that @xmath18 is an admissible based arrangement .",
    "then the morphism @xmath12 is an isomorphism onto a union of zariski connected components .",
    "[ c5 ] the variety @xmath48 inherits all the singularities of the representation variety @xmath49 corresponding to points of @xmath50 , whence ( since all real points of @xmath51 are anisotropic ) to all singularities of @xmath51 at real points .",
    "combining corollary [ c5 ] with theorem [ moremnev ] we obtain    [ t6 ] let @xmath0 be an affine algebraic variety defined over @xmath1 and @xmath40 be a rational point .",
    "then there exists an admissible based arrangement @xmath18 and a representation @xmath52 with finite image such that the ( analytical ) germ @xmath53)$ ] is isomorphic to @xmath54 .",
    "thus the singularities of representation varieties of artin groups at representations with finite image are at least as bad as germs of affine varieties defined over @xmath1 at rational points .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath55 is a ( connected ) smooth complex algebraic variety and @xmath2 is an algebraic lie group , the singularities of @xmath56 at representations with finite image are severely limited by theorem [ t7 ] below .",
    "we will need the following    let @xmath57 be a real or complex analytic space , @xmath58 and @xmath2 a lie group acting on @xmath57 .",
    "we say that there is a local _ cross - section _ through @xmath59 to the @xmath2-orbits if there is a @xmath2-invariant open @xmath3 of @xmath59 and a closed analytic subspace @xmath60 such that the natural map @xmath61 is an isomorphicm of analytic spaces .",

    "thus theorem [ t7 ] implies that the group @xmath45 is not the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety .",
    "our convention for coxeter graphs is different from the standard convention for dynkin diagrams .",
    "namely , if two vertices are not connected by an edge * it does not mean that corresponding generators commute*. if on our diagram an edge has no label , we assume that the edge has the label @xmath7 . on the diagram for a * shephard group *",
    "if a vertex has no label this means that the corresponding generator has * infinite order*.    there is a local cross - section to the @xmath77-orbit through the representation @xmath78 ( that appears is theorem [ t6 ] ) , hence we apply theorem [ t7 ] and conclude that @xmath45 is not the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety . to see that there are infinitely many distinct examples we may proceed as follows .",
    "take the varieties @xmath79 , @xmath80 are prime numbers .",
    "clearly @xmath81 is not analytically isomorphic to @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "thus for all @xmath84 the varieties @xmath81 are not analytically isomorphic to quasi - homogeneous varieties described in the theorem [ t7 ] .",
    "hence the artin groups @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath81 are not fundamental groups of smooth complex quasi - projective varieties .",
    "note that among the groups @xmath85 we have infinitely many ones which are not mutually isomorphic .",
    "the reason is that for any finitely - generated group @xmath86 the character variety @xmath87 has only finite number of isolated singular points whose germs are isomorphic to one of @xmath81 .",
    "this proves theorem [ moremorgan ] .    in  [ triv ]",
