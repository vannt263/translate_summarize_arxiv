    "deep submillimeter surveys provide a probe of galaxies which is almost independent of luminosity for a wide redshift range @xmath13 , because of the negative k - correction in the infrared ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) and max - planck millimeter bolometer ( mambo , @xcite ) have now discovered several hundred submillimeter galaxies ( smgs : e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our knowledge of smgs has been hampered by the large beamsize of the submm telescopes , which makes it difficult to identify counterparts in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "for example , in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) north field there are typically @xmath14 _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) optical galaxies within a single scuba 15 arcsec beam .",
    "deep radio surveys have proven to be one of the best ways to identify the counterparts to smgs ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation processes that heat the dust responsible for the submm light also produce radio emission , as evidenced by the well known far - infrared  radio correlation . taking advantage of this ,",
    "smgs have been matched to radio sources , which have much better positional accuracy , and the optical / near - ir counterparts can then be found after the radio identification has been made .",
    "this is possible because the density of sources in the deepest radio images is much less than that of optical galaxies , so the probability of a chance coincidence is lower .",
    "the current knowledge of smgs is biased towards the radio identified sources .",
    "the smgs have a median redshift of about 2.2 and bolometric infrared ( ir ) luminosities @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the optically identified smgs are faint optically , ( @xmath16 ) , and red ( @xmath17 in ab magnitudes ) , with about 30% having colors consistent with extremely red objects ( eros , @xcite ) .",
    "thus smgs are thought to be high redshift , dusty analogs of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of smgs have traditionally been fit with local ulirgs as templates , and in particular arp220 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which has an effective dust temperature of about 4247@xmath18k ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a typical dust temperature of @xmath19k and a median @xmath20 for their smg sample .",
    "this is cooler than local ulirgs , which have an average dust temperature of @xmath21k ( based on the dunne et al .  2000 sample ) .",
    "the far - ir background ( firback ) study of 170@xmath0 m selected galaxies found two ulirgs between @xmath22 which have seds cooler and less luminous than arp220 @xcite .",
    "a 350@xmath0 m study of radio - detected smgs found temperatures of @xmath23k ( kovacs et al .",
    "2006 ) . using the @xmath24 m imaging from the _ spitzer _ legacy project goods , @xcite",
    "securely identify 60% of smgs in this field in the mid - infrared ( mir ) , and have tentative counterparts for another 34% .",
    "it was found that the observed mir  submm ",
    "radio sed of the smgs peak at longer wavelengths than local ulirgs and are best fit by models with temperatures of about @xmath25k ( pope et al .",
    "there is thus an emerging picture that smgs are cooler than previously thought .",
    "dust temperature affects the inferred ir luminosity , and hence star formation rate ( sfr ) , that is derived for these galaxies .",
    "studies of smgs have often assumed dust temperatures of @xmath26k ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a drop from @xmath26k to @xmath27k in temperature decreases the ir luminosity by about a factor of two .",
    "better knowledge of the temperature of smgs is thus crucial for more accurate luminosity estimates .",
    "the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ makes it possible to study the mir and fir properties of smgs in detail for the first time . at the median smg redshift of @xmath28 ,",
    "pah and silicate features fall into the rest - frame wavelength of the 24@xmath0 m band .",
    "this can make it difficult to determine the total infrared luminosities and to fit model seds well to the fir , which does not always correlate with the mir .",
    "the 70@xmath0 m band of the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) instrument is not affected by pah or silicate features for redshifts less than about 3 , while the 160@xmath0 m band is not affected at all .",
    "moreover , these mips bands are closer to the fir peak than the mir data points used in previous studies .",
    "the longer wavelength mips bands should therefore be extremely useful for studying smgs .",
    "the sensitivities and confusion limits at 70@xmath0 m make this feasible , but difficult , and hence only the deepest mips data are likely to lead to smg detections .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of the fir properties and seds of submm galaxies using the deepest 70 and 160@xmath0 m data available for the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "in particular , we use the 70 and 160@xmath0 m data to check if the seds of distant smgs are consistent with those of local ulirgs .",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath29 , together with matter and cosmological constant density parameters of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in this paper .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 etc .  throughout for the flux densities at @xmath35 m , @xmath36 m and @xmath37ghz .",
    "the scuba ` super - map ' of goods - n contains 35 robust 850@xmath0 m detections .",
    "details of the data reduction and source extraction can be found in borys et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and pope et al .",
    "this submm image contains all publicly available scuba mapping data in this field taken up until 2004 .",
    "although @xmath38 m data were also taken , they unfortunately have essentially no constraining power . of the 35 scuba sources ,",
    "33 have likely radio and/or _ spitzer _ counterparts using the very large array ( vla ) , infrared array camera ( irac ) and mips 24@xmath0 m data in goods - n ( see pope et al .",
    "thirty of these scuba galaxies are within the ultra - deep 70@xmath0 m image area .",
    "scuba sources with low signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) may have true flux densities which are boosted by a factor which depends on the source brightness and the local noise in the scuba map , and can be estimated if the source counts are known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore in this study we use the deboosted 850@xmath0 m flux densities given in pope et al .",
    "the mips 70@xmath0 m observations were carried out during cycle 1 of the general observer program ( _ spitzer _ program i d 3325 , frayer et al .",
    "the inner @xmath39 of goods - n was mapped to a depth of @xmath40ksec .",
    "the data were taken in the small - field photometry mode of mips with 10-second data collection events ( dces ) . each astronomical observation request ( aor ) consisted of an 8-position cluster map , and the observations were completed with 12 aors in total .",
    "in addition to our go data , we used the mips guaranteed time observers ( gto ) data ( program i d 81 , @xcite ) .",
    "these gto data have an integration time of @xmath41sec .",
    "the raw data were processed off - line using the germanium reprocessing tools ( gert , version s13.1 ) , following the algorithms derived by the mips team @xcite .",
    "instrumental artifacts in the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) were removed using the filtering techniques adopted for the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls , @xcite ) .",
    "the data were calibrated assuming an absolute flux calibration factor of @xmath42 per mips-70@xmath43 m unit for stellar seds .",
    "the flux densities were multiplied by 1.09 to apply a galactic sed color correction .",
    "this assumes a power law sed of the form @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but the color corrections are similar for @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final image achieves a sensitivity of @xmath48mjy rms and we have cataloged 101 sources ( over @xmath49 ) with @xmath50mjy ( snr@xmath51 ) .",
    "we catalog a region slightly larger than the area of deepest coverage to include some relatively bright 70 @xmath43 m sources and improve statistics .",
    "the source counts are presented in @xcite and a full catalog will be presented in huynh et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the 70@xmath0 m image has a beam size of 185 fwhm , and in the presence of gaussian noise the 1@xmath52 positional error of sources is of the order @xmath53 , i.e. 3   for the faintest sources .",
    "the 160@xmath0 m observations of the goods - n region were taken as part of the mips gto program in 2004 .",
    "these data were taken in the scan mode of mips and we applied the standard filtering techniques to the 160@xmath0 m bcds similar to what was used for the xfls @xcite .",
    "the data were calibrated using a factor of @xmath54 per mips-160@xmath0 m unit .",
    "the 160@xmath0 m data have an effective integration time of 120 seconds and the 160@xmath0 m image reaches a sensitivity of @xmath55mjy rms .",
    "a multiplication of 1.04 was applied to the 160@xmath0 m flux densities to color correct for galaxy seds .",
    "we also note that the 160 @xmath43 m light leak from 1  1.6 @xmath43 m is not a problem for this data because there are no blue sources with m@xmath56  @xmath57  5.5 in the field .",
    "the negative k - correction at submillimeter wavelengths means that smgs are detectable in deep scuba images over a wide redshift range , @xmath13 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , at 70 and 160@xmath0 m , the k - correction does not compensate for the distance dimming , and the flux density of a galaxy with a given intrinsic luminosity drops steeply as a function of redshift ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is reflected in the high median redshifts of the smgs ( @xmath58 , pope et al .",
    "2006 ) compared to the 70@xmath0 m sources ( @xmath59 , huynh et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "hence the smg and 70@xmath0 m samples are unlikely to have much overlap , and we only expect to detect the low redshift smgs in deep 70@xmath0 m imaging .",
    "we examined the 70@xmath0 m image for counterparts to the scuba sources . to do this",
    "the 70@xmath0 m catalogue positions were compared to irac positions of the scuba counterparts ( pope et al .",
    "2006 ) , searching within 10  of each submm counterpart .",
    "this search radius was chosen in order to take into account the typical positional uncertainties of low snr 70@xmath0 m and scuba sources added in quadrature .",
    "this procedure uncovered two secure identifications of smgs at 70@xmath0 m , gn26 and gn13 ( following the naming convention of pope et al .",
    "these sources have 70@xmath0 m snrs of 12 and 8 , respectively , and hence 70@xmath0 m positional uncertainties of about 13 and 15 ( including the _ spitzer _ 1  pointing uncertainty ) .",
    "the positional offset of the 70@xmath0 m source relative to the irac position is 0.6 and 0.3 arcsec for gn26 and gn13 , respectively , which is well within the positional uncertainty .",
    "the probability that one or more 70@xmath0 m sources lies randomly within a distance @xmath60 of a scuba counterpart is : @xmath61 given a surface density @xmath62 of 70@xmath0 m sources ( often called the @xmath63-statistic , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence the probability of any 70@xmath0 m source lying within 1  of a scuba counterpart is 0.07% , using the 70@xmath0 m source density of 101 sources over 120 arcmin@xmath64 , and hence the 70@xmath0 m matches to gn13 and gn26 are likely to be real .",
    "two more smgs ( gn12 and gn32 ) have a nearby 70@xmath0 m source at distances of 4.7and 9.5 , respectively .",
    "the 70@xmath0 m sources near gn12 and gn32 have irac and 24@xmath0 m counterparts which do not match the identifications for the scuba source ( pope et al .",
    "although it is likely that some fraction of the 70@xmath0 m flux density is associated with the submm galaxy , it is difficult to determine this fraction because of the other 24@xmath0 m sources in the vicinity . using equation  ( 1 ) , the random probability that 2/30 scuba sources have a 70@xmath0 m source within a distance of 10  can be determined to be 28% .",
    "this is consistent with the 70@xmath0 m sources near gn12 and gn32 being random matches .    at 160@xmath0 m",
    "the only smg detected is gn26 .",
    "the beamsize at 160@xmath0 m is 40 , so 70@xmath0 m and/or scuba sources which are close together may be blended into one 160@xmath0 m source .",
    "examination of the 70@xmath0 m mips image suggests that the 160@xmath0 m flux density of gn26 has some contribution from another 70@xmath0 m source ( at @xmath65 ) not associated with gn26 .",
    "we therefore deblended gn26 with a double gaussian fit , fixing positions to the irac counterparts of the two 70@xmath0 m sources which contribute to the 160@xmath0 m flux density .",
    "we find that gn26 has @xmath66mjy , which is 60% of the flux density of the 160@xmath0 m complex . the uncertainty at 160@xmath0 m is conservatively estimated to be 25% , taking into account absolute calibration , fitting errors , and deblending issues .",
    "we also examined the sed of the source near gn26 to check the accuracy of the deblending .",
    "the @xmath67 ratio of the second source at @xmath65 is well fit by the quiescently star - forming galaxy sed templates of @xcite , so the deblending at 160@xmath0 m seems reasonable .",
    "the multi - wavelength properties of the two smgs which are detected at 70@xmath0 m ( figure  1 and table  1 ) are described in detail in pope et al .",
    "as expected , both sources ( gn26 and gn13 ) are in the low redshift tail of the submm redshift distribution .",
    "furthermore , we notice that these two sources are among the faintest at 850@xmath0 m in the submm sample ( both have @xmath68mjy ) and therefore they are not typical of the full submm sample presented in pope et al .",
    "( 2006 ) or indeed other samples of smgs .",
    "gn13 and gn26 have 70@xmath0 m flux densities of 6.5 and @xmath69mjy , respectively , while the full 70@xmath0 m catalog has a median flux density of @xmath70mjy .",
    "about 80% of the 70@xmath0 m sources have spectroscopic redshifts , and the median redshift of these sources is @xmath65 ( huynh et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "thus the 70@xmath0 m counterpart to gn13 is typical of the full 70@xmath0 m sample , but gn26 is unusual in that it has a bright 70@xmath0 m counterpart , and is one of only seven 70@xmath0 m sources in our sample currently confirmed to be at @xmath71 .",
    "we performed a stacking analysis to derive an average 70@xmath0 m flux density for the smg population in the goods",
    "- n field . to begin with",
    ", we stacked the _",
    "spitzer _ data at the positions of all smgs , including sources with 70@xmath0 m matches or with coincident flux . for each smg",
    "a square image 132  on a side ( approximately 7 mips beams ) was extracted .",
    "we rotated each image by @xmath72 with respect to the previous one before co - adding to remove any large - scale background effects .",
    "the median level of the individual extracted images was subtracted to remove any small scale offsets and yield better background removal .",
    "flux densities were determined using an aperture of 12  radius , and we applied an aperture correction of 2.0 , which was calculated empirically from bright sources in the image .",
    "the aperture photometry was done after the background was subtracted from the stacked images , and the results were verified by making measurements with different size sky annuli .    to estimate the expected scatter , offset",
    "stacked images were generated by randomly choosing a position in the 70@xmath0 m image for each stacked source .",
    "five hundred such random stacks were generated , and the uncertainty in the stacked flux density is taken to be the standard deviation of these 500 measured values .    the average 70@xmath0 m flux density ( @xmath73 ) for all 30 smgs is @xmath74mjy , and hence the stacked signal is detected at over @xmath75 .",
    "the contribution from smgs to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) at 70@xmath0 m can be estimated from this stacked signal by multiplying by the appropriate source density . assuming the smg integrated source count of @xmath76 for @xmath1mjy @xcite",
    ", we estimate the contribution to the 70@xmath0 m ebl from smgs to be @xmath77 . from an extrapolation of the source counts @xcite",
    "find that the total 70@xmath0 m ebl is @xmath78 , so smgs ( @xmath1mjy ) make up about @xmath6% of the 70@xmath0 m ebl .",
    "the 70@xmath0 m stacked signal from all 30 smgs is dominated by the 4 low redshift sources with coincident 70@xmath0 m flux density . to determine the average properties of the smgs _",
    "not _ detected at 70@xmath0 m , which is more representative of the general smg population , we also stacked the 26 sources without coincident 70@xmath0 m flux density .",
    "this time we stacked the residual 70@xmath0 m image , which was obtained by removing all sources brighter than 3@xmath52 at 70@xmath0 m .",
    "sources were removed by subtracting their fitted point spread functions from the image .",
    "the residual image was used to obtain a better signal to noise ratio in the stacked image and in the measured stacked flux density . for these 26 sources",
    "we find @xmath79mjy , and so this stacked signal has an snr of about 3 .    to test whether the majority of the stacked 70@xmath0 m flux density is from the lower redshift smgs , we also looked at low and high redshift sub - samples .",
    "the low redshift sub - sample consists of 12 smgs out of the 26 with @xmath80 , and the remaining 14 smgs with @xmath81 make up the high redshift sub - sample .",
    "for redshift completeness we included irac photometric redshifts from pope et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for 8/26 smgs , and these all have @xmath82 ( and estimated accuracy of @xmath83 ) .",
    "the aperture flux density in the central region of the high redshift stack is @xmath84mjy , while for the low redshift stack it is more positive at @xmath85mjy .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the majority of the flux density from the full sample is coming from the lower redshift sources , although the measurements are too noisy to make a definitive statement .    similarly , we stacked the 160@xmath0 m image at all smg positions , excluding the one detected source , gn26 .",
    "there is no significant flux density in the stacked image and the 3@xmath52 upper limit is @xmath86mjy .",
    "a stack of the 12 low redshift smgs gives a 3@xmath52 upper limit at 160@xmath0 m of @xmath87mjy .    to study the fir properties of smgs we could use the average flux densities of the full sample of smgs",
    "however , the stacked 70@xmath0 m flux density from the separate high- and low-@xmath8 sub - samples clearly show that most of the signal is coming from @xmath80 sources ( as expected from the k - correction ) .",
    "we therefore limit our analyses to the average properties of the low-@xmath8 sub - sample in the following sections .",
    "the average ir colors , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are shown in figure  2 as a function of redshift .",
    "gn26 , at @xmath88 is consistent with a more active dale & helou ( 2002 , hereafter dh02 ) model , with dust intensity index @xmath89 , whereas gn13 has cooler colors , corresponding to @xmath90 . in the dh02 models",
    "@xmath91 defines the amount of dust as a function of heating intensity @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the dust mass heated by a radiation field of intensity @xmath94 .",
    "these @xmath91 values span the range expected for infrared luminous galaxies  a low value around 1 implies a high contribution from photo - dissociation regions in an actively star - forming galaxy , while a significantly higher value represents the cirrus - dominated interstellar medium of a more quiescent or cooler galaxy .",
    "the infrared colors of the average low-@xmath8 smg are consistent with @xmath952.5 dh02 seds .",
    "the average @xmath3 ratio of smgs from the stacking analysis indicates that the smgs are relatively cool galaxies for their high ir luminosities , which is consistent with pope et al .",
    "we also calculated upper limits to the @xmath3 ratio for smgs _ not _ detected individually at 70@xmath0 m ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the lower redshift smgs are clearly inconsistent with lower values of @xmath91 .",
    "for the higher redshift sources we expect much lower @xmath3 ratios , but with the current observational limits these sources can still be actively star - forming .    for gn13 ,",
    "figure  2 shows that the @xmath4 ratio is that of an actively star - forming galaxy , with @xmath961.5 , while the @xmath3 ratio indicates it is a cooler galaxy .",
    "this may be due to broad silicate absorption falling into the 24@xmath0 m band ; the @xmath4 ratio can be strongly affected by pah features and silicate absorption , which are not fully accounted for in the models .",
    "we find that the colors of gn26 are consistent with dh02 models with @xmath97 and @xmath982 ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the colors of gn13 place it at @xmath992 if a @xmath100 model is assumed ( figure  3 ) .",
    "however , gn13 is at @xmath101 and so this smg has a warmer @xmath4 ratio than that suggested by its @xmath3 ratio , as mentioned earlier .",
    "the average colors of low-@xmath8 smgs are also plotted in figure  3 .",
    "we find that the average ir colors are best represented with a dh02 model having @xmath952.5 at @xmath992 .",
    "this is consistent with the median redshift of the low-@xmath8 smg sub - sample , and suggests the color - color plot can be used as a crude redshift indicator .",
    "the fir photometry at 70 and 160@xmath0 m provides valuable data points for constraining the fir peak .",
    "combined with the 850@xmath0 m observations , the photometry spans both sides of the peak .",
    "previous estimates of the sed of smgs have relied on extrapolating the mir or radio to fit the fir peak  at the redshifts of smgs , the mir can be affected by complex emission and absorption features , so this method may not be reliable .",
    "we fit a variety of models to the data . these include four dh02 models with @xmath91 = 1 , 1.5 , 2 , and 2.5 , as well as the chary & elbaz ( 2001 , hereafter ce01 ) seds , which are templates derived from isocam , _ iras _ and scuba data of nearby galaxies .",
    "the ce01 models have luminosity dependent shapes , but since the local luminosity  temperature relation found for nearby galaxies may not hold for high-@xmath8 smgs ( e.g.  pope et al .",
    "2006 ) , we fit ce01 models allowing them to scale arbitrarily in luminosity .    for gn13 and for the low-@xmath8 smg sub - sample ,",
    "we constrain the fit with the 70 and 850@xmath0 m observations only , since they are not detected at 160@xmath0 m ( although the 160@xmath0 m data provide a useful upper limit ) . for gn26 , the 70 , 160 and 850@xmath0 m observations",
    "are all used to constrain the fit .",
    "we summarize the fitting results in table  2 , while figures  4 and 5 show the best fit seds for gn13 , gn26 , and the average low-@xmath8 smg .",
    "fitting ce01 seds without allowing the luminosity to vary freely results in relatively poor fits , so we exclude these from the table .",

    "the models provide good fits to the 70 and 850@xmath0 m data for gn13 and for the low-@xmath8 average smg , but they do not typically fit the 24@xmath0 m ( observed ) data point , although it has been shown that the 24@xmath0 m flux density can often be fit with additional extinction ( pope et al .",
    "the models do not provide a similarly good fit in the fir for gn26 ; the 70 and 850@xmath0 m data points of gn26 are well fit , but the 160@xmath0 m measurement is underestimated by the models . hence the luminosity for gn26 is probably higher than given by these models .",
    "nevertheless , our derived ir luminosity for gn26 is 3 times greater than that estimated by pope et al .",

    "this demonstrates the power of 160@xmath0 m photometry in constraining the total infrared luminosity of galaxies , but shows that higher resolution is required to study such faint sources individually .",
    "the smgs have high luminosities , but their fir spectral shape is different from local ulirgs of the same luminosity .",
    "we find that the average low-@xmath8 smg has a total ir luminosity of about @xmath105 .",

    "if the 24@xmath0 m data point is included in the fitting of gn13 along with the 70 and 850@xmath0 m data , we find the best fit dh02 sed peaks at shorter wavelength , corresponding to warmer dust temperatures , and the total ir luminosity is decreased by a factor of about 2 . there is no significant difference in the ce01 fits to gn13 with and without the 24@xmath0 m data point . for gn26",
    "we find the 24@xmath0 m data point makes no significant difference to the best fit dh02 sed , while the best fit ce01 model is slightly warmer and 3 times less luminous .",
    "the fit to the average smg including the 24@xmath0 m data point is warmer than that with only the longer wavelength data , and the best fit dh02 and ce01 seds are about 2 times more luminous . at the median redshift of the average low-@xmath8 smg , @xmath113 , pah and silicate features fall into into the 24@xmath0 m band , and",
    "our fit here is driven by these features in the model seds .",
    "the dh02 and ce01 seds certainly contain pah features , but it is not clear whether smgs at this redshift have strong or weak pah features , if any . therefore we would argue that the fit to the 850 and 70@xmath0 m flux densities alone gives a more reliable result for the average smg total luminosity , at least for the moment , until we learn more about the mir spectra of smgs .",
    "as a phenomenological alternative , we also adopt a modified blackbody sed model to fit the temperature of these smgs .",
    "the sed is described by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the blackbody function for dust of temperature @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the dust emissivity index .",

    "although this simple phenomenological model can not describe the full complex dust properties of a galaxy , it can provide a good description of the general behavior of the sed . the range of parameters we consider is @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which is representative of galaxies ranging from normal spirals to agn .",

    "the results are summarized in table  3 . when fitting only two data points ( and allowing the normalization to also be free ) there is a strong degeneracy between @xmath123 and @xmath116 ( which would be complete except for the boundaries of the parameter ranges )  so the fit parameters must be interpreted with caution . in the case of gn13",
    ", the full range of @xmath123 is allowed by the 70 and 850@xmath0 m data , with low values of @xmath123 corresponding to low values of @xmath116 .",

    "this implies that the average low-@xmath8 smg in our sample has a relatively steep mid - ir sed , since our model fits with @xmath137k require @xmath138 .",
    "this suggests that the smgs are star - forming galaxies , because large @xmath123 implies cool mid - ir colors , which are inconsistent with agn - dominated sources .    assuming that the submm light is thermal emission from dust which is optically thin at @xmath139 m , with a single dust temperature @xmath116",

    "this does not take into account the uncertainties in @xmath143 and @xmath33 ; the dust mass uncertainty is about 50% when these are added in quadrature .",
    "these dust masses are consistent , within uncertainties , with the molecular gas mass derived from co observations ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , assuming a typical galactic gas mass to dust mass ratio @xmath149 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "these values are consistent with the local value of @xmath154 , suggesting that these two sources follow the local fir  radio correlation .",
    "as mentioned in section 8 , the inferred high values of @xmath123 suggest that agn do not dominate the bolometric luminosity in our sample of smgs . to quantify the contribution of agn to the infrared luminosity of smgs",
    ", we adopt the simple modified blackbody approach as described in section  8 . for our agn model",
    "we use @xmath157 , @xmath158k , and @xmath159 , as found for the xfls agn population ( frayer et al .",
    "we subtract this agn component from the observed 70 and 850@xmath0 m flux densities of the average smg , and then repeat the fitting procedure with the dh02 and ce01 models , increasing the agn component until the best fit @xmath103 value exceeds the previous minimum by @xmath160 .",
    "this allows us to estimate the maximum agn contribution to the fir luminosity , with the results shown in figure  5 .",
    "it could be argued that the mir waveband is the best discriminator of agn , and therefore we should be focussing on the 24@xmath0 m data point ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are here calculating the percentage contribution of agn to the @xmath102 , which is dominated by the fir peak , and the contribution from agn emission in the mir is only a very small proportion of the total ir luminosity .",
    "for the average low-@xmath8 smg , an agn which contributes up to 14% of the ir luminosity is allowed , using only the previous best fit ce01 sed model . if all ce01 models are used in the refitting , an agn component of up to 23% contribution is allowed . together",
    "these fitting procedures imply that the average ( low-@xmath8 sub - sample ) smg is dominated by a starburst .",
    "this is consistent with x - ray studies which find that agn contribute on average 10% to the infrared luminosity of smgs @xcite .    for the 70@xmath0 m detected smgs , gn13 and gn26",
    ", we find that 32% and 21% , respectively , of the total ir luminosity can be attributed to an agn from the same analysis applied to the best fit templates .",
    "however , if the whole suite of ce01 seds are used , a larger proportion of the ir luminosity can be subtracted off the observed data points , with lower luminosity ce01 models still fitting .",
    "this shows that with the current data a low luminosity starburst model from ce01 with an additional dominant agn component is indistinguishable from a high luminosity ce01 ulirg model , and that further photometry ( or spectroscopy ) is needed .",
    "another method to estimate the agn contribution is to make use of the 24@xmath0 m data . here , we consider the extreme case where all the 24@xmath0 m flux density is due to an agn , and determine its contribution to the total ir luminosity",
    ". for gn13 and gn26 such an agn would contribute 11% and 5% , respectively , to the total ir luminosity , assuming the @xmath158k , @xmath159 agn model used above , and the ce01 best fit seds .",
    "for the average low-@xmath8 smg , 21% of the total ir luminosity could be attributed to an agn in this extreme case .",
