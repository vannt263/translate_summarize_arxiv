    "calculations of the contributions of high - redshift agn to the ionizing flux in the universe must therefore rely on large extrapolations ( e.g. , madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ) , and deeper observations of the lf are needed to constrain this quantity directly .",

    "we can efficiently search for faint , high - redshift agn using combined ultradeep x - ray and optical imaging .",
    "since at high redshifts observed - frame x - ray bands correspond to very high rest - frame energies , we can obtain a relatively complete sample of agn , including sources surrounded by very high column densities of gas and dust .",

    "if the rest - frame optical to rest - frame x - ray flux ratios of high - redshift , low - luminosity sources are similar to those of the high - redshift , high - luminosity sources in the sdss sample , then the magnitudes of the optical counterparts to the low - luminosity sources would go as faint as @xmath50 , which is well - matched to our @xmath43 color - selection limit .",
    "however , if instead high - redshift , low - luminosity sources have lower rest - frame optical to x - ray flux ratios ( green et al .  1995 ; vignali , brandt , & schneider 2003 ) , then the counterparts could be fainter than @xmath50 .",
    "high - redshift sources in the x - ray sample are easily identified because the increasing line blanketing of the lyman forest at high redshifts produces extremely large breaks across redshifted ly@xmath51 ( e.g. , fan et al .",

    "2001 ) , then the break is extremely large at redshifts higher than this . the ly@xmath51 line moves through our longest wavelength ( @xmath29 ) band at @xmath57 , which is the largest redshift where a source would be seen in our optical data .",

    "many of these faint sources may lie at lower redshifts ( e.g. , yan et al .",
    "2002 ) , and some may be false x - ray detections ; about half lie within a factor of 2 of the flux limit at their off - axis radius , so this is an upper bound . within a @xmath67 off - axis radius where the sensitivity is relatively uniform",
    ", 9 of these optically faint sources could have rest - frame @xmath22  kev luminosities in excess of @xmath68 erg  s@xmath15 , if they were placed in the @xmath9 redshift range .",
    "only 7 of these are not detected in @xmath27 or @xmath28 and could lie beyond @xmath55 .",
    "the cumulative surface density of field sources to @xmath43 is @xmath69  deg@xmath70 , so we expect that about 30 of our sources with bright optical identifications may be chance projections , with the true optical counterparts being fainter .",
    "if we assume that these 30 sources are similar to the 77 isolated faint sources discussed above , then we can include these sources in our candidate @xmath0 population with a scaling factor of 1.4 .",
    "haiman & loeb ( 1999 ) predicted a surface density of @xmath71 @xmath0 sources in a @xmath67 radius circle above a flux of @xmath72  erg  @xmath19  s@xmath15 ( observed @xmath73  kev ) .",
    "we find less than four such @xmath0 objects , or a maximum of 5.6 if we use the 1.4 scale factor discussed above .",
    "the surface density is at least an order of magnitude lower than the haiman & loeb estimate , strengthening the similar conclusion reached by alexander et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hasinger ( 2002 ) by about a factor of three .",

    "( 2002b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a we show the number density obtained using only the one @xmath0 spectroscopic identification ( solid diamond ) .",
    "we also computed an upper limit to this number density by assigning all the optically faint sources that could lie in the redshift interval redshifts at the center of the interval ; the horizontal bar corresponds to those with @xmath75 in the specified luminosity range . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a we compare our @xmath9 number density with the lower redshift number densities from cowie et al .",

    "again , the symbols denote the number densities obtained from only the spectroscopically identified agn , while the horizontal bars show the upper limits .",
    "the bars are not consistent with one another because all the unidentified sources are included in each redshift bin if they lie in the specified luminosity range . to compare with the optically - selected samples of boyle et al .",

    "[ fig4 ] , but the number densities in the @xmath68 to @xmath74  erg  s@xmath15 range ( agn whose luminosities would classify them as seyferts ) show a slow decrease with increasing redshift from @xmath79 to @xmath55 .",
    "this result holds even within the systematic uncertainties shown by the the horizontal bars .",
    "in contrast , the number densities in the @xmath74 to @xmath47  erg  s@xmath15 range ( agn with quasar luminosities ) peak at @xmath80 and closely match in shape the evolution of the optically - selected samples .",
    "figures  [ fig4]a and b show that this conclusion does not depend on the cosmological geometry .    the number density at @xmath9 for @xmath81 to @xmath74  erg  s@xmath15 is about three orders of magnitude higher than the optically - selected sdss sample at @xmath82  erg  s@xmath15 .",
    "while this conclusion is based on the single @xmath0 object , the fact that other high - redshift agn have also been found in the relatively small _ chandra _ fields ( silverman et al .",

    "if we use our spectroscopically identified point , the slope @xmath85 of the lf ( @xmath86 ) would be about @xmath87 , which is similar to the bright end slope at lower redshifts in both the optical ( pei 1995 ) and x - ray ( miyaji et al .",
    "if we include the unidentified objects , the maximum value of @xmath85 would be about 3 . a detailed lf determination for this redshift interval will require much larger area x - ray samples .",

    "a power - law with our observed slope of @xmath88 matched to the sdss data fails by more than an order of magnitude to ionize the intergalactic medium at these high redshifts , even extrapolating to faint magnitudes ( their fig .",
    "we may derive this result more directly by calculating the number of ionizing photons ( @xmath89 ) per baryon ( @xmath90 ) produced in the redshift interval by the observed agn .",
    "we first sum the @xmath91-corrected fluxes of the sources to determine the rest - frame @xmath10    background light they produce and then convert this to the number density of ionizing photons using the form of the near - ultraviolet agn spectrum given in madau , haardt , & rees ( 1999 ) , which gives a ratio @xmath92 ionizing photons per erg  hz@xmath15 at @xmath10   .",
