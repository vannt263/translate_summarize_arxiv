    "<S> measurements of de haas - van alphen oscillations in both the normal and mixed states have revealed the quasi two - dimensional nature of the fermi surface and the presence of a small number of electrons exhibiting 3d behavior.@xcite through point - contact spectroscopy measurement , rourke et al.@xcite found that in cecoin@xmath0 there are two coexisting order parameter components with amplitudes @xmath15 = 0.95 @xmath16 0.15 mev and @xmath17 = 2.4 @xmath16 0.3 mev , which indicate a highly unconventional pairing mechanism , possibly involving multiple bands . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , in the multiband scenario proposed by rourke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and tanatar et al.,@xcite different gaps may behave differently in magnetic field , which may lead to a field dependent @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> also an anisotropic gap may result in a temperature dependent @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> reports up to date give values of the anisotropy of cecoin@xmath0 in the range 1.5 to 2.47 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , petrovic et al . have reported an anisotropy of at least 2 , as estimated from the ratio of the upper critical fields h@xmath23 along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite measurements of h@xmath24 at 20 mk give a value for the anisotropy of about 2.47.@xcite magnetization measurements of the lower critical field for temperatures between 1.5 and 2.1 k give the ratio of the out - of - plane and in - plane penetration depth @xmath25 and of the in - plane and out - of - plane coherence length @xmath26 , which gives an anisotropy of 2.3 and 1.5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    magnetic torque is a sensitive tool for probing the anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been successfully applied to investigate the highly anisotropic high temperature superconductors and also the less anisotropic materials such as mgb@xmath11 . @xcite but all these previous torque measurements were made on materials which have negligible paramagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , cecoin@xmath0 is a magnetic superconductor , so it may have large paramagnetism which can not be ignored in the study of the mixed state . here , we report torque measurements on single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 both in the normal state and the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> our results show large paramagnetism in this material in the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we assume that there are two contributions to the torque signal in the mixed state of cecoin@xmath0 single crystals : one coming from paramagnetism and the other one coming from vortices . </S>",
    "<S> we determined @xmath9 from the reversible part of the vortex signal and found that @xmath9 is not a constant , instead , it is field and temperature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this provides evidence that the picture in this unconventional superconductor is not a simple single band scenario , supporting the conclusions of rourke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and tanatar et al.@xcite      high quality single crystals of cecoin@xmath0 were grown using a flux method . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperature @xmath13 , defined as the value of @xmath2 at zero resistivity , is 2.3 k. the surfaces of the single crystals were etched in concentrated hcl for several hours and then thoroughly rinsed in ethanol in order to remove the indium present on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the single crystal for which the data are shown is 0.75 mg . </S>",
    "<S> angular dependent measurements of the magnetic torque experienced by the sample of magnetic moment @xmath27 in an applied magnetic field @xmath4 , were performed over a temperature range 1.9 k @xmath28 20 k and applied magnetic field range 0.1 t @xmath29 14 t using a piezoresistive torque magnetometer . in this technique , </S>",
    "<S> a piezoresistor measures the torsion , or twisting , of the torque lever about its symmetry axis as a result of the magnetic moment of the single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was rotated in the applied magnetic field between @xmath30-axis ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32-axis ( @xmath33 and the torques @xmath34 and @xmath35 were measured as a function of increasing and decreasing angle , respectively , under various temperature - field conditions .    the contributions of the gravity and puck to the total torque signal were measured and subtracted from it . to measure the background torque due to gravity , we measured the torque signal at different temperatures in zero applied magnetic field with the sample mounted on the puck . </S>",
    "<S> the gravity torque is almost temperature independent and it is negligible at high applied magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the applied magnetic field decreases , the total torque signal becomes smaller and the effect of gravity becomes important , hence should be subtracted from the measured torque . </S>",
    "<S> to determine the contribution of the puck to the measured torque , we measured the torque without the single crystal on the puck at different magnetic fields and temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the torque of the puck increases with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> also , the contribution of the puck to the measured torque is much larger than the contribution of the gravity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the former contribution should always be subtracted from the total measured torque signal .      </S>",
    "<S> previous torque studies of tl@xmath11ba@xmath11cuo@xmath36 @xcite and mgb@xmath11@xcite systems have shown that the normal state torque coming from paramagnetism is small compared with the flux - vortex torque , therefore , one could neglect the former contribution to the total torque signal measured in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not the case for cecoin@xmath0 , for which the paramagnetic torque signal in the normal state is comparable with the total torque signal measured in the superconducting state , as shown below . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one needs to subtract the former signal from the latter one in order to determine the torque due to vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the case of the electron - doped high - t@xmath37 cuprate nd@xmath38ce@xmath39cuo@xmath40 , where a large paramagnetic contribution from nd ions is discussed seperately from a superconducting contribution.@xcite therefore , we first discuss the field and temperature dependence of the magnetic torque in the normal state and show how we subtract this contribution from the measured torque in the mixed state , and then we return to the discussion of the torque signal in the mixed state and to the determination of the field and temperature dependence of the bulk anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> all the torque curves measured in the normal state , some of which are shown in fig 1 , are perfectly sinusoidal and can be well fitted with    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is a temperature and field dependent fitting parameter . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , note the excellent fit of the data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) ( solid lines in the figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the field dependence of @xmath43 at 1.9 , 6 , 10 and 20 k is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the solid lines are linear fits to the data , which show that @xmath43 is linear in @xmath4 with a negligible @xmath44-intercept and a slope which increases with decreasing @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 with c a temperature dependent fitting parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> next we show that the torque measured in the normal state and given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) is a result of the paramagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the torque of a sample of magnetic moment @xmath27 placed in a magnetic field @xmath4 is given by @xmath47 the resultant magnetic moment @xmath48 can always be decomposed into a component parallel @xmath49 and one perpendicular @xmath50 to the @xmath51plane of the single crystal . with the magnetic field @xmath4 making an angle @xmath6 with the @xmath7axis of the single crystal , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) becomes :    @xmath52\\hat{k}.\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the experimental relationship of the torque , given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) with the fitting parameter @xmath42 given by eq . ( 2 ) , becomes @xmath53 therefore , with @xmath54 , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) give @xmath55 where @xmath56 , the @xmath20-axis susceptibility , and @xmath57 where @xmath58 , the @xmath19-axis susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the torque measured experimentally is of the form : @xmath59 the fact that @xmath60 [ see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) ] shows that @xmath43 plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 reflects the anisotropy of the magnetic moments along the two crystallographic directions , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , while its linear field dependence shows that the magnetic moments are linear in @xmath4 , hence the susceptibilities along these two directions are field independent . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the magnetic moments is given by the temperature dependence of the parameter @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , eq . ( 7 ) shows that the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 dependences of the torque measured in the normal state of cecoin@xmath0 reflect its paramagnetism and the anisotropy of its susceptibility @xmath62 along the @xmath20 and @xmath19 directions .    to further check the consistency of the data and to precisely determine the paramagnetic value of the torque </S>",
    "<S> , we also measured the magnetic moment @xmath27 of the same single crystal of cecoin@xmath0 using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moments measured at 4 , 6 , 10 , 15 , and 20 k are plotted in the main panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 as a function of the applied magnetic field for both @xmath63-axis ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 @xmath20-axis ( @xmath5 ) . the magnetic moments for both field orientations are linear in @xmath4 with @xmath66 for all temperatures measured , consistent with the torque data of fig . 2 and with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the units for the magnetic moments of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2 and 3 are different . </S>",
    "<S> we change the units and compare the results of the two types of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the torque measured at 6 k and 5 t gives @xmath67 am@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath69 , @xmath70 am@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the squid measurements give at the same temperature and applied magnetic field @xmath71 emu = @xmath72 am@xmath68 and @xmath73 emu = @xmath74 am@xmath68 ; hence , an anisotropy @xmath75 am@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the values of the magnetic moments obtained in the two types of measurements are within @xmath76 of each other , an error well within our experimental error .    the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 is a plot of the susceptibilities along the two directions , calculated from the slopes of @xmath77 of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . clearly @xmath78 shows anisotropy with respect to the field orientation . note that the susceptibilities for both directions increase with decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous increase of @xmath78 in the investigated temperature range may be related with the non - fermi liquid behavior due to the proximity to the quantum critical field . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite these values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are consistent with the ones reported by other groups . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the above study of the magnetic torque in the normal state has shown that the contribution of paramagnetism to the torque signal is very large , it has a quadratic @xmath4 dependence , and also a @xmath2 dependence [ see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ] . therefore , to extract the vortex torque in the mixed state </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to account for this paramagnetic contribution and subtract the two background contributions from the measured torque . </S>",
    "<S> the gravity and puck contributions to the measured torque were determined and subtracted as explained in the experimental details section . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant torque includes the paramagnetic @xmath81 and the vortex @xmath82 contributions and is plotted in the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . we need to mention here that the vortex and paramagnetic torque contributions have opposite signs since the magnetic moment representing the vortex torque is diamagnetic .    </S>",
    "<S> the inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 is the angular dependent torque measured in the mixed state at 1.9 k and 0.3 t in increasing and decreasing angles . </S>",
    "<S> again , this torque includes @xmath81 and @xmath82 . note that @xmath83 displays hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> this hysteretic behavior is similar to the behavior in high @xmath14 superconductors and is a result of intrinsic pinning . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the reversible component of the torque is determined as the average of the torques measured in increasing and decreasing angle ; i.e. , @xmath84 a plot of @xmath85 , obtained from @xmath86 and @xmath87 data is shown in the main panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the reversible component of the torque reflects equilibrium states , hence it allows the determination of thermodynamic parameters . in the three - dimensional anisotropic london model in the mixed state , the vortex torque @xmath82 is given by kogan s model.@xcite we assume that the paramagnetic contribution in the mixed state is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath88 where @xmath20 is a fitting parameter , @xmath89 is the volume of the sample , @xmath90 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath91 is the penetration depth in the @xmath51plane , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 is a numerical parameter of the order of unity , and @xmath95 is the upper critical field parallel to the @xmath19-axis [ @xmath96 k@xmath97 t ] . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath98 .    to obtain the field dependence of the anisotropy @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , we fit the torque data with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) , with @xmath20 , @xmath99 , and @xmath9 as three fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line in the main panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 is the fitting result for @xmath2 = 1.9 k and @xmath4 = 0.3 t. we need to mention here that the value of the fitting paramter @xmath20 is 20@xmath100 smaller than what we would expect from the extrapolation of the normal state paramangetic torque data . also , @xmath20 has an @xmath4 dependence with an exponent of 2.3 instead of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> so , either there is extra contribution from other physics which has a weak field dependence , in addition to the paramagnetism contribution , or maybe the paramagnetic contribution becomes smaller in the mixed state of cecoin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further experiments are needed to clarify this issue .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 is a plot of the field dependence of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset is an enlarged plot of the low field region . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath99 displays linear behavior up to a certain field with no y - intercept , then it deviates from linearity at @xmath101 t , and it increases fast in the high field region . since , on one hand @xmath102 should be field independent , and on the other hand eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) is valid only for applied magnetic fields much smaller than the upper critical field , i.e. @xmath103 for a given temperature , we assume that @xmath104 t , the field at which @xmath105 deviates from linearity , is the cutoff field @xmath106 for the applicability of the above theory . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of @xmath105 in the linear @xmath4 regime gives @xmath102 ( @xmath2 = 1.9 k ) = 787 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this value is larger than previous reports , which give @xmath91 = 600 nm from measurements using a tunnel diode oscillator @xcite and @xmath91 = 330 nm from magnetization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    next , we fix @xmath102 to the three values given above and fit the @xmath85 data with only two fitting parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> . the resultant field dependence of @xmath9 is shown in fig . 6 for the different @xmath102 values . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath9 is first decreasing with increasing @xmath4 , reaches a minimum at @xmath4 = 0.5 t , and then increases with further increasing field . as mentioned above , the cutoff field is 0.5 t. the data for @xmath107 are not reliable due to the failure of kogan s theory in this @xmath4 region . </S>",
    "<S> so we conclude that the anisotropy @xmath9 decreases with increasing field . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this field dependence of @xmath9 in cecoin@xmath0 is opposite with the one for mgb@xmath11 , @xcite in which @xmath9 increases with increasing field . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the value of @xmath9 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath102 , i.e. , the larger the value of @xmath102 , the larger the value of @xmath9 , with no effect however on its @xmath4 dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> to study the temperature dependence of @xmath9 , we performed torque measurements in the mixed state at 1.9 k , 1.95 , 2.00 k in an applied magnetic field of 0.3 t , and determined @xmath9 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 7 is a composite plot of the temperature dependence of the anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the squares give @xmath108 determined from torque measurements as discussed above [ with @xmath109 ( 1.9 k ) = 600 nm , @xmath109 ( 1.95 k ) = 670 nm , and @xmath109 ( 2 k ) = 740 nm taken from ref ( 25 ) ] , the solid circles give @xmath108 calculated from the ratio of @xmath110 taken from previous reports,@xcite while the triangles give @xmath108 determined from @xmath111 measured in zero field [ see @xmath112 and @xmath113 in inset to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the overall trend is a decrease of the anisotropy with increasing @xmath2 , with a stronger dependence around @xmath114 t@xmath115 k. the values of @xmath9 obtained from torque measurements are well within the range previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the anisotropy depends both on temperature and magnetic field could explain its relatively wide range of values reported in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> the field and temperature dependence of the anisotropy implies the breakdown of the standard anisotropic gl theory , which assumes a single band anisotropic system with a temperature and field independent effective - mass anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a temperature and field dependent anisotropy was previously observed in nbse@xmath11,@xcite luni@xmath11b@xmath11c,@xcite and mgb@xmath11 , the latter one having a value of @xmath9 similar with cecoin@xmath0 . very recently , fletcher et al . reported measurements of the temperature - dependent anisotropies ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) of both the london penetration depth @xmath102 and the upper critical field of mgb@xmath11.@xcite their main result is that the anisotropies of the penetration depth and @xmath118 in mgb@xmath11 have opposite temperature dependences , but close to @xmath14 they tend to a common value [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 of ref ( 30 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result confirms nicely the theoretical calculation of anisotropy based on a two - gap scenario.@xcite so , the temperature dependence of @xmath9 in cecoin@xmath0 and mgb@xmath11 could have a similar origin . the field dependence of @xmath9 could also be related with a multiband structure . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the response to an applied magnetic field may be different in the case of the d - wave superconducting gap on the heavy - electron sheets of the fermi surface and the negligible gap on the light , three - dimensional pockets .      </S>",
    "<S> torque measurements were performed on cecoin@xmath0 single crystals in both the superconducting and normal states . </S>",
    "<S> two contributions to the torque signal in the mixed state were identified : one from paramagnetism and the other one from the vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the torque curves show sharp hysteresis peaks at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the angle between @xmath4 and the @xmath7axis of the crystal ) when the measurements are done in clockwise and counterclockwise directions . </S>",
    "<S> this hysteresis is a result of the intrinsic pinning of vortices , a behavior very similar to high transition temperature cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the anisotropy @xmath9 is obtained from the reversible part of the vortex torque . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath9 decreases with increasing magnetic field and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates the breakdown of the ginzburg - landau theory , which is based on a single band model and provides evidence for a multiband picture for cecoin@xmath0 , which is highly possible due to its complex fermi topology . </S>",
