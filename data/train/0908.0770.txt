    "newtonian gravitation has been shown to describe the motions of bodies with intermediate accelerations ( e.g. solar system bodies ) very accurately .",
    "the newtonian theory of gravity breaks down in the presence of strong gravitational fields , where it has been successfully superseded by general relativity , but there is evidence that there are also discrepancies in the low - acceleration regime .",
    "spiral galaxies , for example , require the invocation of dark matter ( dm ) to reconcile the discrepancy between their rotational velocities and our understanding of newtonian gravity .",
    "another indication is the so - called `` pioneer anomaly '' : radiometric data from pioneers 10 and 11 have shown that both are experiencing an unexplained constant acceleration of @xmath0ms@xmath1 toward the sun ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , all spacecraft in the outer solar system seem to be experiencing this anomalous acceleration ( e.g. @xcite ) , potentially indicating a deviation from newtonian gravity at low accelerations .",
    "it has been claimed that one of the leading versions of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can predict the kinematic properties of galaxies without invoking dm .",
    "mond predicts a breakdown of newtonian gravity at an acceleration scale @xmath2ms@xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this is approximately the acceleration regime where dm becomes necessary to reconcile theoretical velocity profiles of galaxies with observation .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are the ideal test bed for this divergence from newtonian predictions , since they are thought to contain little or no dm .",
    "this is based on evidence from dynamical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ n_-body simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observations of gc tidal tails ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dynamical and luminous masses of gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lack of microlensing events from gc - mass dark haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , gcs at different distances from the galactic centre experience differing gravitational attractions from the galaxy , so that any galactic influence can be ruled out if all exhibit similar behaviour .",
    "furthermore , the accelerations experienced by stars in gcs drop below @xmath3 well inside the tidal radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite showed that there may be a flattening of the velocity profiles of several gcs in the galactic halo ( @xmath4 centauri , m15 , m30 , m92 and m107 ) , at or about the acceleration where dm is invoked to maintain stability in rotating galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite overlaid the @xcite results with a modified gravity ( mog ) model and found little , or no , deviation from newtonian gravity , for gcs with masses less than a few times @xmath5m@xmath6 . because both groups used an identical set of measured velocity dispersions",
    ", there is an obvious discrepancy .",
    "if mond were correct , it would mean that all gravitational interactions would diverge from newtonian gravitation in the predicted regime .",
    "irrespective of mond itself , testing the gravitational interaction at low accelerations is extremely important in the overall understanding of gravity .",
    "this paper continues this test , with four galactic halo gcs , namely m22 ( ngc 6656 ) , m30 ( ngc 7099 ) , m53 ( ngc 5024 ) and m68 ( ngc 4590 ) .",
    "we used the multi - object , double - beam spectrograph ( aaomega ) on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope at siding spring observatory in new south wales , australia , to obtain the spectra for this survey .",
    "aaomega has 392 fibres covering a 2 square degree field of view with each fibre capable of obtaining a single spectrum from a single star in this field .",
    "the 1500v grating ( with a resolution of @xmath7 ) was used in the blue arm and the 1700d grating ( @xmath8 ) was used in the red arm , with the central wavelengths set to 5200  and 8640 , respectively .",
    "this configuration was chosen to include the calcium triplet lines at 8498 , 8542  and 8662 , for accurate velocity determination and proxy metallicities , as well as the swathe of iron and magnesium lines around 5200  for accurate metallicity measurements .",
    "the astrometric positions of the targets , taken from the 2mass point source catalogue , have accuracies of @xmath9 .",
    "the observations were taken over two observing runs , on 58 and 1419 june 2008 , with an average seeing of @xmath10 .",
    "we obtained 3@xmath111200-second exposures per fibre configuration , to obtain s / n@xmath12 , with several configurations per cluster ( see table [ observed stars ] for actual numbers of spectra obtained for each cluster  note that for m68 , 3 configurations were obtained in june 2008 , and 5 further configurations were obtained during a separate service run in may 2009 ) . in this study",
    "we also made use of data for m30 obtained in a previous observing run in 2006 ( originally published by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "flat fields , arc lamp exposures and @xmath1325 dedicated sky fibres were used for data reduction and calibration .",
    "fear , cuar , cuhe , cune and thar arc lamps were used to ensure accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "data reduction was performed using the 2dfdr pipeline , designed specifically for the reduction of aaomega data .",
    "the efficacy of the pipeline has been checked with a comparison of individual stellar spectra .",
    "we aimed to observe several hundred stars from each of four gcs , namely m22 ( ngc 6656 ) , m30 ( ngc 7099 ) , m53 ( ngc 5024 ) and m68 ( ngc 4590 ) .",
    "these four targets were selected by several criteria : they are bright ( @xmath14 ) , nearby ( @xmath15kpc ) and have radial velocities @xmath16@xmath17 from the peak velocity given by the besanon galaxy model in that direction , for ease of extracting the cluster members from galactic contaminants .",
    "one cluster ( m30 ) was included specifically because it was one of the targets of @xcite , and it satisfied all other selection criteria .",
    "this allows a comparison with the results of that study .",
    ".clusters selected for the current survey , based on the criteria outlined in the text , with the total number of fibre configurations , and spectra , obtained during the run .",
    "note that the number of spectra quoted here is the total number of spectra obtained before galactic contaminants were removed .",
    "for m68 , 3 configurations were observed on the two observing runs in june 2008 and 5 subsequent configurations were observed during a service run in may 2009 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one important indicator of large quantities of dm in a dynamical system is a large mass - to - light ratio ( i.e. m / l@xmath181 ) .",
    "furthermore , this dm will cause the stars to have large accelerations , and therefore inherently higher maximal velocities , and hence a larger velocity dispersion . an obvious way to determine whether or not a pressure - supported object like a gc is dark matter dominated is to measure its m / l@xmath19 .",
    "of course , this requires a surface brightness profile , for which we have used those by @xcite .",
    "these profiles were converted to solar luminosities per square parsec .",
    "the density profile was then calculated using ( again , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath20    the m / l@xmath21 profiles are shown in figure [ m / l ] , along with the m / l@xmath21 ratios .",
    "the vertical line shows the value of @xmath22 . because the central regions of gcs are highly concentrated , particularly in post - core - collapsed clusters , it is difficult to accurately determine the mass in the core .",
    "the m / l@xmath21 ratios have , therefore , only been calculated for radii greater than @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite showed that ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) follow the same luminosity  velocity dispersion relation as old gcs . since it has also been shown that ucds with a dynamical m / l@xmath21 up to 5 do not require dark matter to explain these mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we see no requirement for any of our clusters , apart from m53 , to contain any dark matter component .",
    "@xcite determined that a m / l@xmath23 for ucds may indicate some dark matter content , and since we estimate m / l@xmath24 for m53 , this may indicate a small dark matter component in this cluster .",
    "note that if we take the lower limit of our uncertainties for the mass - to - light ratio of m53 we reach the regime where dark matter is not required , and none of our clusters show m / l@xmath25 , indicating dm is not dominant .",
    "note that we have produced m / l@xmath21 _ profiles _ rather than simply deriving a single m / l@xmath21 value from the central velocity dispersion and central surface brightness .",
    "we suggest that determining m / l@xmath21 profiles is preferable because it describes the m / l@xmath21 of the entire cluster outside the core , rather than just its core .",
    "this is especially true for post - core - collapse clusters , such as m30 , in which the core masses are highly uncertain .",
    "furthermore , m30 is the only cluster in our sample known to have a collapsed core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this cluster also has a maximum in its m / l@xmath21 profile at about the scale radius @xmath22 , which may be due to mass segregation .",
    "the most massive stars are known to fall toward the core during the evolution of the cluster ( see * ? ? ? * for a review of mass segregation processes in gcs ) .",
    "the somewhat less pronounced maximum in the m / l@xmath19 profile of m68 may be the first evidence that this cluster is currently undergoing core collapse .",
    "it has been argued that a central concentration parameter @xmath26 may indicate a collapsed core in certain gcs , and for m68 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "note that , despite our calculation of the m / l@xmath21 ratio being restricted to @xmath28 , the profiles should be accurate for @xmath29 , the core radius , or @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we argue that the peak in m / l@xmath21 is real , although a larger sample of cluster members for @xmath31 will be required to test this and , therefore , to show whether m68 is truly undergoing core collapse .",
    "we have studied four gcs to determine their velocity dispersion profiles , and found that neither dm nor modified gravity are required to reconcile the kinematic properties of these particular clusters .",
    "m53 may contain a small dm component , indicated by a m / l@xmath23 , but it is not dominant . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the m / l@xmath21 ratio of m53 is still consistent with little , or no , dm content .",
    "the dynamics of all four clusters are well described by a purely analytic @xcite model , which indicates that newtonian gravity adequately describes their velocity dispersions , and shows no breakdown of newtonian gravity at @xmath2ms@xmath1 , as has been claimed in previous studies .",
    "furthermore , the plummer model was used to determine the total mass , scale radius ( the radius at which half the mass is contained ) , and the m / l@xmath19 profile for each cluster .",
    "we find that none of our clusters have m / l@xmath25 , another indication that dm is not dominant . within the uncertainties ,",
    "our estimated cluster masses all match those in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the same is true for the m / l@xmath21 ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have produced m / l@xmath19 _ profiles _ , rather than quoting a single value based on the central velocity dispersion and central surface brightness .",
    "this method is preferred because it describes the m / l@xmath21 of the entire cluster , rather than only its core ; this is particularly important for post - core - collapsed gcs for which the central mass is highly uncertain .",
    "because the only known of our clusters to have a collapsed core ( m30 ) shows a peak in its m / l@xmath21 profile at approximately @xmath22 , this may be an indication of the resulting mass segregation . if this is the case , then we may have the first evidence that m68 , which also exhibits a m / l@xmath32 peak near @xmath22 and has a central concentration of 1.91 @xcite , is currently undergoing core collapse .",
    "further observations are required , both photometric and kinematic , to confirm this .",
    "another important result from this study is the measured rotations of our clusters . of the four clusters studied here ,",
    "one exhibits an obvious rotation , namely m22 , with an axis of rotation approximately north - south .",
    "m68 may be rotating as well and additional data are required to confirm this .",
    "m53 and m30 do not show any rotation to the level of 0.5kms@xmath33 and 0.8kms@xmath33 respectively .",
    "while these results are strongly indicative of the current picture of globular clusters being dark matter poor , and their dynamics can be explained by standard newtonian theory , we are currently undertaking robust dynamical modelling of gc systems to fully address the question of the influence of non - newtonian physics in explaining our observations .",
