    "dissipation in high - tc superconductors caused by motion of vortex lines has become one of the richest fields in the phenomenology of these new materials.@xcite from the point of view of applications this dissipation is one of the principal limiting factors when trying to achieve high critical currents . from a purely theoretical point of view , due to the high critical temperatures and to the layered structure , the physics of the vortex structure becomes qualitatively different to that in the low - tc materials . the magnetic field - temperature ( @xmath3 ) phase diagram is not well described by a mean field approximation .",
    "an estimation of the fluctuation - dominated region around the mean field phase transitions in the @xmath3 diagram shows that this is quite accessible experimentally .",
    "one of the new phases of the system that has been observed in the high tc s is the so - called liquid phase .",
    "this phase is characterized by the fact that the vortex lines are easily movable by applying an external force on them by putting a current @xmath4 , i.e. , the resistance of the system , defined as @xmath5 is different from zero .",
    "this liquid phase is found for high enough temperatures , whereas for @xmath6 lower than a well defined value @xmath7 , the resistance becomes zero .",
    "@xmath7 is the superconducting transition temperature in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the nature of the transition at @xmath7 depends on the disorder present on the system .",
    "when the amount of disorder is very small , the low temperature phase is an abrikosov solid phase and the transition at @xmath7 is a first order melting transition , with the resistivity having a jump at @xmath7.@xcite for higher disorder a vortex glass phase has been proposed for @xmath8.@xcite in this case the transition at @xmath7 is second order and the resistivity displays critical scaling for @xmath6 close to @xmath9 . in some cases",
    "a crossover due to thermal depinning of vortices occurs.@xcite    all these features correspond to the case when the magnetic field ( which we always supposed applied along the _ c _ axis of the material ) and the external current are perpendicular to each other .",
    "when the current is parallel to the magnetic field a naive argument would say that the dissipation is zero ( up to the zero field transition temperature @xmath10 ) because the lorentz force on the vortices is zero .",
    "however , it has been found experimentally that the transition temperature in this case -which we will call @xmath0- is lower than @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior is related to the thermal fluctuations of the vortex lines .",
    "the point of wether @xmath0 coincides or is higher than @xmath7 has been highly controversial .",
    "it has been found experimentally that for twinned ybacuo samples @xmath0 turns out to be higher than @xmath11@xcite in other words , the superconducting coherence is lost in two steps when raising the temperature : along the _ ab _ plane at @xmath7 and along the _ c _ axis a @xmath12 . in addition , @xmath0 seems to approach @xmath7 when increasing the thickness of the sample.@xcite theoretically , there have been much discussion about the possibility of the loose of coherence in two successive steps , although the results are not conclusive .",
    "@xcite numerical simulations give support to the picture of one @xcite or two @xcite transitions depending on the model and the parameters used to describe the problem .",
    "it has been realized that a non - zero dissipation for an arbitrary small applied current parallel to the field -i.e .",
    ", a non - zero resistivity- would require the existence of arbitrary large loops parallel to the _ ab _ planes .",
    "@xcite arbitrary large isolated loops have infinite energy , and thus the thermal energy which is necessary to create them is infinite .",
    "however , the superposition of a large amount of small loops could generate an arbitrarily large one at finite temperatures .",
    "the question arises of wether the generation of these large loops is a thermal crossover or a real phase transition occurring at temperature @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we will try to clarify these points , by performing numerical simulations on the three dimensional ( 3d ) josephson junction array ( jja ) model , which has been used previously to study thermodynamical as well as transport properties of high tc superconductors .",
    "@xcite as the whole problem is too broad , we will concentrate here on the properties of samples with disorder and not too high anisotropies , leaving the study of the dependence on the amount of disorder for another work.@xcite it will be shown than in this case -in coincidence with experiments- the 3d jja model _ for finite values of the thickness _ has two different transition temperatures @xmath7 and @xmath0 for the onset of the resistivity in the _ ab _ plane and along the _ c _ axis , respectively .",
    "the transition at @xmath7 is -in the case of our model and for the values of paramenters used- a thermal depinning of vortex lines , but in a real materials corresponds to a second order phase transition -the vortex glass transition , which has been extensively studied before .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 corresponds to the onset of the resistivity along the _ c _ axis .",
    "we will show @xcite that @xmath0 is the threshold value of a percolation phase transition perpendicularly to the applied field .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 is a well defined thermodynamical temperature for any value of the thickness of the sample , as long as the _ ab _ plane can be considered as infinite .",
    "the precise value of @xmath0 decreases when increasing the thickness , suggesting that the two transitions collapse onto a single one for a bulk 3d sample .    in order to show these properties of the transition at @xmath0",
    ", we perform finite size scaling on the three 3d jja model .",
    "we find that the system exhibits critical behavior around @xmath0 , which reflects , in particular , in a critical scaling of the @xmath2 curves .",
    "the values of the critical exponents are different to those find for the vortex glass transition at @xmath7 and agree with those found for the _ c _ axis @xmath13 curves of real materials .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the 3d jja model that we use for a detailed investigation of the finite size scaling of the transition at @xmath0 . in section",
    "iii a simplified model for the percolation transition is introduced .",
    "this model allows to derive quantitative expressions for the finite size scaling that can be checked against the numerical simulations , and we do that in section iv , showing that the numerical data scale as expected for a percolation transition . in section",
    "v we focus on the consequences of a percolation transition on the experiments , and indicate that this consequences are indeed observed .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize and conclude .",
    "for the numerical simulations , we have worked on the isotropic three dimensional - resistively shunted - josephson junction array model @xcite on a cubic lattice .",
    "this model has been extensively used to derive sensible results for thermodynamical as well as transport properties of the vortex structure in high - tc superconductors . when looking at equilibrium properties it reduces to the 3d uniformly frustrated xy model .",
    "the 3d - jja is conformed by a set of josephson junctions connecting nearest neighbor nodes of -in our case- a cubic lattice .",
    "each junction consists of an ideal josephson junction of critical current @xmath14 , shunted by a normal resistance @xmath15 , and a johnson noise generator , which accounts for the temperature .",
    "thus , the current @xmath16 through each junction is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the difference between the superconducting phases on the two nodes connected by the link .",
    "a vortex in a given plaquette of the model is characterized by a value of @xmath19 when following the variation of the superconducting phase around this plaquette .",
    "an external current applied between two opposite sides of the sample produces a lorentz force on the vortices of the system , and may give rise to dissipation , which is characterized by a finite value of the potential difference @xmath20 between the two contacts .",
    "this potential difference is calculated in terms of the phases of the system by using the josephson equation @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the phases of the contacts , and @xmath24 indicating a time average .",
    "the system of equations ( [ i ] ) are complemented by the condition of conservation of currents on each node .",
    "the equations are numerically integrated in time @xcite and different magnitudes are calculated after thermalization at each temperature .    the boundary conditions ( bc )",
    "are taken open in the _ ab _ plane . however ,",
    "if open bc in the _ c _ axis are used , there will be a finite force on an isolated vortex at finite temperature if the top and bottom ends of the vortex are not aligned .",
    "the dissipation -that is non - zero even in the linear regime- caused by this net force turns out to be independent of the thickness of the sample , and in this sense , it is only a surface effect.@xcite in order to eliminate this spurious surface effect it is crucial to use bc for the _ c _ direction that assure that each vortex line leaving the sample at a given point of the bottom plane re - enters at the same point of the top plane .",
    "strict periodic bc on the phases @xmath25 have this property , however we would obtain that the voltage difference between top and bottom planes is identically zero .",
    "we use boundary conditions in the _ c _ direction that reduce the surfaces effects drastically -although _ does not _ eliminate them completely .",
    "we proceed as follows : we numerically integrate the equations of motion for an open system one time step , and find the value of the phases in the bottom and top plane @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then the phases in this two planes are modified to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the mean difference between the phases of top and bottom planes . at this stage",
    "the equations are integrated another time step .",
    "this process guarantees that the vortex configuration is periodic along the _ c _ axis , allowing at the same time to calculate the voltage difference when we apply a current . the relation between _ c",
    "_ axis resistivity and percolation described in section iv would not be observable if open boundary conditions were used .",
    "flux conservation implies that every flux line going into a unit cell of our lattice also goes out of the cell .",
    "when two vortices go into the same elemental cell we can not tell which one of the two outgoing vortices correspond to each one of the ongoing vortices .",
    "we interpret this situation as the meeting of two vortex lines . in a real material",
    "this corresponds to two vortex lines being at a distance lower than the core size of the vortex . at high enough temperatures the vortex structure",
    "is heavily interconnected , and we can follow a vortex line starting from one side of the sample and arriving to the opposite side . in this case",
    "we will say that the vortex structure has percolated perpendicularly to the applied field . due to the finite size of the systems used , and to the dynamical evolution",
    ", percolation is not expected to occur at every time , but only at a given fraction of the total time , which depends on temperature .",
    "we evaluate the probability @xmath31 that there exists a vortex line crossing the system from one side to the opposite as a function of temperature .",
    "this probability @xmath31 will be one of the most important variables in our analysis .    the ideal abrikosov ( triangular ) vortex lattice is frustrated on the subyacent square lattice .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the uniformly frustrated xy model on a square lattice have strong and non - monotonic variations as a function of the field , due to commensurability effects.@xcite this is a spurious effect for us , because we are interested in the simulation of systems as close to the real samples as possible . in this work we concentrate on the case of disordered samples ,",
    "in which an abrikosov -or any ordered- lattice does not exist at all , even at low temperatures . in real samples this may be due to the existence of twinned boundaries or point defects , and the physics of the low temperature phase may be that of a vortex glass or simply a frozen ( disordered ) set of flux lines .    in the numerical calculations we simulate the disorder by considering the 3d jja system with a random (",
    "non - correlated ) distribution of critical currents of the junctions .",
    "the energy of a vortex in a single loop with one josephson junction of critical current @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath14 , so when taking a random distribution of critical currents the links with lowest @xmath14 act as pinning centers of vortices .",
    "if the disorder -i.e , the dispersion of @xmath14- is high enough , then the configuration of the ground state will be disordered , and not related to the commensurability of the vortex lattice parameter and the subyacent square lattice . in fig .",
    "[ t0 ] we show a top view of the vortex lattice at zero temperature , as obtained when slowly cooling down the system in the presence of an external field of value @xmath32 in units of flux quanta per plaquette .",
    "two different results after the annealing process for the same distribution of disorder are shown .",
    "they correspond to a system of @xmath33 sites , with a squared random distribution of critical currents ranged between @xmath32 and @xmath34 , which is the same distribution that we use throughout the paper .",
    "as can be seen , the vortex structure is not the corresponding to an ordered system , and moreover the vortex lines are not necessarily straight . using this disordered jja system we have checked we obtain a quite smooth behavior of the quantities we calculate ( for example the resistivities ) as a function of the field .",
    "it must be keep in mind that the situation for samples without defects , especially in the case of a triangular lattice of josephson junctions , is different to the one described here , @xcite and will be addressed in another work.@xcite",
    "the transition at @xmath7 of our model corresponds to a depinning of vortex lines from their equilibrium positions due to thermal activation .",
    "this reflects in the form of the resistivity vs temperature curves ( current along the _ ab _ plane ) which show a typical thermally activated behavior.@xcite in addition , the process is well described by a single vortex model , indicating that collective effects are of minor importance .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , the transition at @xmath0 is a collective effect . as we said before , for @xmath35 there",
    "exist some paths crossing the sample perpendicularly to the applied field , that are free to move when a current parallel to the field is applied .",
    "we will show now that these paths appear at @xmath0 due to a percolation phase transition of vortex lines .",
    "we start by introducing a simple model which will allow us to check the proposed percolation phase transition by using standard finite size scaling .",
    "let us consider the bond percolation problem on a cubic structure of size @xmath36 , but with one important modification : the vertical bonds are supposed to be present with probability one , whereas the horizontal bonds are present with probability @xmath37 .",
    "this means that in all cases ( for all values of @xmath37 ) a rigid squared lattice of lines piercing the sample along the _ c _ axis ( representing the vortex lines at @xmath38 ) is present .",
    "we will consider the value of @xmath37 as a function of temperature ( see below ) , and look for the probability @xmath31 that there exists a path connecting two opposite sides of the sample perpendicularly to the rigid lines .",
    "this model has a percolation phase transition that can be easily characterized in terms of the percolation transition of the corresponding two dimensional bond percolation problem on the square lattice .",
    "for example , if we look at the percolation probability @xmath39 on a two  dimensional sample of size @xmath40 , it satisfies ( in the limit of large @xmath41 ) a scaling relation of the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a universal function.@xcite the values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are known to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the exponent @xmath45 is the one controlling the divergency of a correlation length @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "this correlation length measures the typical size of a cluster in the system .",
    "the value of @xmath31 for our model can be read out from the solution for the percolation probability of the two dimensional case , simply noting that two neighbor rigid lines are connected if there is at least one horizontal segment between them .",
    "this corresponds to replace @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ p2d ] ) by @xmath51 .",
    "so , we obtain @xmath52 with @xmath53 similar scaling expressions for other quantities are readily derived .",
    "we will tentatively apply these scaling expressions to the vortex structure . before showing the results ,",
    "it is important to point out the differences between the two situations : the percolation of a real vortex structure is a complicated interacting percolation problem , which proceeds via thermal fluctuations of vortex lines and thermally generated loops of different sizes and energy scales .",
    "moreover , only paths which conserve the direction of the magnetic flux has to be considered . in the simplify model , instead , we use a single probability @xmath37 , which is related to the temperature by a boltzmann factor , i.e. , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being a energy scale that is roughly given by the energy of a vortex loop connecting two nearest vortices in the real system . in terms of the temperature",
    ", the scaling variable @xmath56 reads @xmath57",
    "we first show in fig . [ pnoesc ] the results for the percolation probability @xmath31 obtained for the jja model as a function of temperature -in units of the mean josephson energy of each junction- for an external magnetic field @xmath58 flux quanta per plaquette , which is the value that we used in all simulations . the results for different values of @xmath41 and @xmath59 , as well as the best fitting to equations ( [ scale ] ) and ( [ variable ] ) are shown .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath44 , @xmath55 , and @xmath45 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pnoesc](c ) , the scaling is quite good in spite of the approximations involved , giving confidence on the correctness of our ideas .",
    "the values obtained for the parameters are @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "although these parameters were considered as free variables , the relation of @xmath44 and @xmath45 with the values corresponding to the 2d model ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) is noteworthy .",
    "the size effects due to the finite values of @xmath41 and @xmath63 have very different effects that can be read out from the plots in fig .",
    "[ pnoesc ] ( a ) and ( b ) : when @xmath41 increases for a given value of @xmath63 , the percolation transition as a function of temperature becomes steeper , indicating that we have a well defined percolation transition in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "this is the usual finite size effect of a two - dimensional second order phase transition .",
    "note that this occurs for a fixed ( finite ) value of the thicknesses @xmath63 , and that the transition temperature @xmath0 -defined as the temperature at which there is a jump in the percolation probability for @xmath65- is well defined .",
    "the threshold value @xmath0 depends on the thickness @xmath63 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pnoesc](b ) @xmath0 decreases as @xmath63 increases . for @xmath66",
    "the form of this dependence can be inferred by putting @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ variable ] ) : @xmath68    this indicates a weak decrease of the transition temperature for thicker samples .",
    "this is easy to understand : the thicker the sample , the probability of having a vortex loop connecting two nearest vortices increases due to the fact that there are more places for creating the loop , the mathematical expression for this fact being contained in equation ( [ variable ] ) .",
    "it should be keep in mind that the dependence of the transition temperature on thickness _ is not _ the usual dependence of a pseudo - critical temperature on the system size , because here we _ do _ have a sharp percolation transition at any @xmath63 ( as long as @xmath65 ) , and in fact the transition is of a two dimensional character .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", it would be interesting to have a relation between the percolation transition and some directly accessible quantity .",
    "this quantity turns out to be the _ c _ axis resistivity of the sample .",
    "the relation between percolation and _ c _ axis resistivity is more clearly seen in the model in which the cosine interactions of the josephson junctions are replaced by villain interactions . in this case , the model can be exactly mapped onto a problem in which -after integrating out a gaussian part , related to spin waves- the only degrees of freedom that remain correspond to the positions of the vortex lines.@xcite moreover , the voltage between two points @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the sample is due to the vortex movement and can be calculated in the following way : each time a vortex line crosses a path joining @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the phase difference @xmath71 between points @xmath69 and @xmath70 changes in @xmath72 , the sign depending on the sign of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 represents the direction of the magnetic field within the vortex , and @xmath75 is its velocity .",
    "the mean voltage between @xmath69 and @xmath70 is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the time of measurement .",
    "( nota : the argument is asintotically correct only when @xmath78 , in other case the result may depend on the chosen path joining @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .    the relation between percolation and _ c _ axis dissipation can now be understood in the following way : if there are mobile vortex lines crossing the sample perpendicularly to the _ c _ axis , any current along this axis dissipates , i.e. , percolation of mobile vortex lines is a sufficient condition for dissipation .",
    "if there are no stationary vortex lines percolationg perpendicularly to the _ c _ axis , still vortex loops can be thermally generated in the sample .",
    "these loops can cut and reconnect and also blow out and leave the sample .",
    "the movement of a vortex loop will generate a net voltage only in the case in which the loop is blown out of the sample , in any other case only fluctuations in the voltage are possible .",
    "if a vortex loop grow to infinity , it implies that it generated during some time interval a percolation path across the sample , so percolation is a necessary condition for dissipation .",
    "note that the argument is not true in the case of using open boundary condition along the _ c _ direction , because in this case a single vortex can give rise to dissipation performing only slight displacements from its equilibrium position.@xcite    the relation between percolation and _ c _ axis resistivity was shown before in ref .",
    "it was argued that the behavior of @xmath79 vs @xmath80 near the threshold is similar to that of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the volume of the percolation cluster ( the percolation cluster @xmath82 is defines as the number of elemental segments of vortex lines which are linked to ( at least ) one percolation path ) .",
    "the argument that led to this conclusion was a counting of the vortex lines that are involved in the dissipation process , as well as the assumption of the validity of a viscous motion description of the vortex lines .",
    "here we put it in the language of scaling near the transition temperature . in the same way as we derived expression ( [ scale ] ) , we can write a scaled relation for the _ c _ axis resistivity which reads @xmath83 with @xmath84 a new universal function , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 being new critical exponents ( the value of @xmath45 in this equation should be the same as in eq .",

    "( [ tp2 ] ) . as we said above , all the results presented here",
    "correspond to the case where the percolation temperature @xmath0 is greater than @xmath7 , and in fact this is a condition for the previous scaling expressions to be valid .",
    "this is because , in order to have dissipation along the _ c _ direction we must have a percolation path across the sample , but it is also necessary that this path is free to move .",
    "as the path consists of segments that go through the horizontal planes , this implies that the temperature should be greater than the value @xmath7 for the thermal depinning of vortices in the planes .",

    "however , when changing the anisotropy , a new feature appears : if there is no correlated disorder in the planes , the vortex configuration in the limit @xmath105 will be dominated by the independent pinning on each planes , with the josephson vortices between planes -which in this limit have an energy @xmath106- forming an entangled set of vortex lines .",

[ titp ] for @xmath111 , although more precise experimental as well as numerical work is needed in order to make the point clearer .    in what follows we discuss some experiments that can be used to discriminate between a crossover or a real phase transition occurring at @xmath0 .",
    "a percolation transition at @xmath0 should reflect in the fact that the @xmath2 curves scale onto two universal curves for @xmath6 higher or lower than @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of scaling has been a convincing proof of the vortex glass phase transition at @xmath7 .    in our picture of a percolation transition",
    "we expect -according to scaling arguments near a second order phase transition-@xcite that the @xmath2 curves for different temperatures plotted as @xmath117 vs @xmath118 show a universal behavior -i.e . , independent of the particular value of @xmath6- , depending only on wether @xmath6 is greater or lower than @xmath0 .",
    "the exponents @xmath92 and @xmath119 can be extracted from the results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "the value at which @xmath120 tends for @xmath121 when @xmath35 should be independent of temperature , so @xmath122 for low currents .",
    "thus we see that @xmath92 is the critical exponent for the resistivity as defined in eq .",
    "( [ ro de t ] ) .",
    "we now show that @xmath45 is the same exponent defined in section iii .",
    "the value of @xmath118 for which the dissipation starts to be appreciable when @xmath123 should again be temperature independent .",
    "this value corresponds to the minimum current @xmath124 that is necessary to blow out the largest vortex loops perpendicular to the applied current that are present in thermal equilibrium .",
    "if these largest loops have linear dimensions @xmath125 , and thus an area @xmath126 , the energy @xmath127 of this loops in the presence of the current @xmath4 is roughly given by @xmath128 , with @xmath98 and @xmath129 numerical constants , and it has a maximum of value @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "the energy @xmath132 when there is no current is simply @xmath133 .",
    "the loop will blow out when @xmath134 , and we get @xmath135cte . as the typical length @xmath48 scales as @xmath136",
    "we conclude that @xmath118 is the appropriate scaling combination , thus justifying the use of @xmath45 for the exponent .",
    "it should be noticed that the same conclusion can be obtained using dimensional analysis,@xcite just keeping in mind that in our case the relevant dimensionality of our diverging clusters is two , instead of three .    if the proposed mechanism for the transition at @xmath0 in the 3d jja model is in fact the one occurring in experiments , the values obtained for the exponents @xmath45 and @xmath92 in both cases should be similar .",
    "preliminary results in ybacuo samples@xcite indicate that this scaling is rather good with values for the exponents that agree with ours .",
    "note that the values @xmath137 and @xmath138 that we found for the exponents are certainly different than those obtained for the vortex - glass transition along the _ ab _ plane ( @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) .",
    "in addition to the experimental investigation of the scaling of the @xmath2 curves , it would be interesting to study the same scaling numerically in the 3d jja model . however , this is a difficult task because of the size effects due to the finite value of @xmath41 .",
    "we have done only two partial checks of the scaling : we found that the current @xmath124 for which the dissipation starts to be appreciable scales as @xmath141 , with the value of @xmath45 in agreement with the value obtained _ independently _ before .",
    "in addition , right at @xmath0 and for intermediate values of the current , the @xmath13 characteristics show a power law behavior @xmath142 with @xmath143 , as expected from the scaling analysis.@xcite    the last point we will discuss in order to check our percolation theory deals with the behavior of the in - plane resistivity @xmath144 as a function of the _ c _ axis resistivity @xmath79 for different values of the external magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that the form of the @xmath144 vs @xmath79 curves for different fields can be used to distinguish experimentally between a second order phase transition at @xmath0 or a crossover due to finite thickness of the samples .",
    "if there were only a unique phase transition at @xmath7 , and the effects seen at @xmath0 were only due to the finite thickness of the sample , the situation would be as follows : the resistivity would be controlled by an anisotropic correlation volume of dimensions @xmath145 and @xmath146 . close to @xmath7 we would have @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( notice that the numerical factor may be different in both cases ) , and thus at @xmath7 we have @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( we suppose that @xmath41 can be considered as infinite in the real samples ) .",
    "the resistivity along the _ c _ axis will be zero as long as @xmath151 , and due to the very thin samples used , the temperature @xmath0 at which @xmath152 , turns out to be higher than @xmath7 .",
    "if the relation @xmath153 is field independent , then the form of the curves @xmath144 vs @xmath79 will not depend on field at all . otherwise , if @xmath153 depends on the actual value of the field , then @xmath144 vs @xmath79 for different fields will not have any constraining relation .",
    "if the system has a percolation phase transition at @xmath0 , at which a correlation length @xmath48 diverges , the situation will be the following : the curves @xmath144 vs @xmath79 may depend in a complicated way on field , except at the point at which @xmath79 becomes zero . at this point",
    "the value of @xmath144 should be independent of the field , the coincidence of @xmath154 for different fields can be explained within our proposed percolation transition scheme : the value of the _ ab _ plane resistivity can be calculated using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . for a single vortex",
    "this dissipation is proportional to the typical lateral squared displacement of vortices divided by the temperature : @xmath155 . for the whole system",
    "the dissipation is proportional to @xmath156 , with @xmath157 the vortex density , which is proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "so we get @xmath158 . at the temperature",
    "at which @xmath79 becomes zero , the displacement @xmath159 is roughly given by the distance between vortices , and goes as @xmath160 , and we obtain that @xmath154 is field independent.@xcite    experimental results indicate that the second possibility is the one that is realized in high - tc materials.@xcite it is observed that the point at which @xmath79 becomes zero corresponds to the same value of @xmath144 irrespective of the field , whereas the part of the curves for @xmath161 does depend on field .",
    "this favors our proposal of a real phase transition occurring at @xmath0 , against the possibility of a crossover due to the matching of a correlation length with the thickness of the sample .",
    "in this paper we presented a description of the _ c _ axis - resistive transition in the mixed state of high - tc superconductors for the case of samples where ( due to disorder and for no so high values of anisotropy ) the superconducting coherence is lost along the _ c _ axis at a temperature @xmath12 _  higher _ than the corresponding to the _ ab _ plane .",
    "we showed that the idea of a percolation phase transition perpendicularly to the applied field as the mechanism driving the _ c _ axis to a linearly dissipative ( resistive ) state is supported by finite size scaling in the 3d jja model as well as transport measurements in ybacuo samples .",
    "the transition is a well defined thermodynamic transition as long as @xmath64 , irrespective of the value of the thickness @xmath63 .",
    "however , the threshold value @xmath0 decreases logarithmically with @xmath63 .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath144 vs @xmath79 curves give support to the idea of a real phase transition at @xmath0 , against the possibility of a crossover due to finite thickness with only one single transition at @xmath7 . also , preliminary results for the critical scaling of the @xmath2 curves are consistent with a phase transition at @xmath0 , the critical exponents being close to those found in the numerical simulations , and certainly different than those found for the vortex glass transition .    as pointed out before , the case corresponding to clean samples ( that can be numerically simulated using triangular lattices ) gives results qualitatively different to the ones described here .",
    "in particular , the interplay between the transitions for the _ c _ axis and for the _ ab _ plane gives rise , in some cases , to a single first order transition . if disorder is then put into the system , the transition remains first order up to a critical value of the disorder .",
    "if the disorder is increased further then two separate transitions ( with @xmath104 if the anisotropy is weak ) are recovered.@xcite    the case of very anisotropic samples , where possibly @xmath115 , still needs further experimental as well as theoretical clarification .",
    "resistivity measurements in bisrcacuo samples have not been able to detect a region where @xmath161 , and at the same time @xmath162 .",
    "however this could be due to the very high aspect ratio of the samples , which prevents an accurate determination of @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , our simulations in the 3d jja model suggest that the case @xmath115 is obtained _ only _ in the case where the vortex lattice -due to the effects of disorder- has percolated even for @xmath107 . for samples without disorder simulations",
    "suggest @xmath163 for very anisotropic samples .",
