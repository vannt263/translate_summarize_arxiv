    "two major aspects of the phenomenology of disk galaxies , with relevant implications on the theory of galaxy formation and evolution , are still hotly debated among the scientific community : ( i ) whether the color - luminosity relation , well established among late - type galaxies , follows from a population sequence , as proposed by gavazzi , pierini & boselli ( 1996 ) ( hereafter gpb96 ) and by gavazzi & scodeggio ( 1996 ) ( hereafter gs96 ) , as opposite to a metallicity sequence ( see visvanathan 1991 ; bothun et al . 1984 ) , which appears to be the case in elliptical galaxies ( see arimoto & kodama , 1997 ) ; ( ii ) whether the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of spiral galaxies belonging to a rich cluster is significantly lower than that of isolated galaxies of similar morphological type , as expected if either formation or evolutionary processes ( e.g. ram - pressure ) would contribute depleting the gaseous content of spiral galaxies in clusters , thus reducing the gaseous reservoir necessary to feed their star formation .",
    "kennicutt s pioneering work in this field helped to establish that the massive ( @xmath7 ) , current ( @xmath8 ) star formation rate of disk galaxies is accurately traced by the integrated @xmath0 + [ nii ] line intensity ( kennicutt 1983a ) normalized to the underlying continuum intensity ( kennicutt 1989 , 1990 ) , i.e. by the line equivalent width ( e.w . ) .",
    "more recently kennicutt , tamblyn & congdon ( 1994 , hereafter ktc94 ) determined that the ratio of the present to past rate increases from 0.01 to 1 along the hubble sequence ( from sa to irr ) , reflecting a change in the star formation properties of disks , and only secondarily a change in the bulge - to - disk ratio .    to investigate the hypothesis i ) , in section 5.1 of this paper we study the dependence of the @xmath0 e.w . on near - infrared h band luminosity . our large ( although not - complete ) sample of galaxies spans a broad range of luminosities for which @xmath0 e.w . and",
    "h band photometry are available .",
    "following gpb96 we assume that the h band luminosity is proportional to the galaxy dynamical mass .    to discuss point ii ) ,",
    "we compare the systematic ( i.e. derived from a survey having the character of completeness ) @xmath0 properties of spiral galaxies as a function of some indicator of their environmental conditions , e.g. their local galaxy density or the projected radial distance from the cluster centers . to this purpose kennicutt & kent ( 1983 ,",
    "kk83 hereafter ) carried out an @xmath0 survey of galaxies belonging to the virgo cluster and compared them with isolated objects .",
    "kennicutt ( 1983b ) tentatively concluded that galaxies belonging to the core of this cluster have a sfr significantly quenched in comparison to normal galaxies .",
    "kennicutt , bothun & schommer ( 1984 , kbs84 hereafter ) extended this study to other dynamical entities , such as the cancer cluster , coma and a1367 . the sample they collected , however , was not sufficient to derive general conclusions .",
    "neither sufficiently complete was the @xmath0 study by gavazzi , boselli & kennicutt ( 1991 , gbk91 hereafter ) who carried out an aperture photometry , narrow band survey of another 55 late - type galaxies in the coma ridge .",
    "they found that a significant number of s+irr galaxies projected onto the two clusters have surprisingly strong @xmath0 emission .",
    "these include the blue galaxies found in the coma cluster by bothun & dressler ( 1986 ) .",
    "a problem affecting these early studies was the lack of a well defined zero point for their environmental comparison , i.e. the properties of isolated galaxies were not known with sufficient accuracy . with the aim of establishing the present high mass sfr of spiral galaxies in the universe and of comparing these properties in environments that differ by an order of magnitude in local galaxy density we undertook the present @xmath0 imaging survey .",
    "the coma supercluster offers a unique test - bed for such systematic study since it contains a filament of galaxies at constant distance from us ( the `` great wall '' ) , thus a volume limited sample can be extracted from a magnitude limited sample .",
    "moreover the properties of galaxies in two rich clusters such as coma and a1367 ( with a density of about 3 galaxies @xmath9 brighter than 15.7 ) can be compared with those of relatively isolated galaxies ( environments with about 10% of the cluster density ) , lying in the bridge between the two clusters at a similar distance from us , thus suffering from similar distance biases .",
    "imaging in the light of the @xmath0+[nii ] line of galaxies selected primarily in the region of the coma supercluster is reported in this work . out of the 262 spiral galaxies brighter than @xmath10 belonging to the `` great wall '' , listed in the catalogue of gavazzi & boselli ( 1996 ) , we observed 90 objects ( 8 additional early - type galaxies were observed serendipitously in the target fields .",
    "these will be not used in the following analysis ) . by themselves these objects do not constitute a complete sample . however , from the observations presented in this paper in conjunction with the @xmath0 aperture photometry measurements taken from the literature ( kk83 , kbs84 , moss , whittle & irwin 1988 ( mwi88 ) , romanishin 1990 , gbk91 ) , two complete subsamples can be extracted :    the `` cluster '' sample contains 40 ( 28 imaged in this work + 12 from the literature ) spiral galaxies with @xmath11 , belonging to either a1367 or to the coma cluster ( a1656 ) ;    the `` isolated '' sample contains 66 ( 44 imaged in this work + 22 from the literature ) galaxies with @xmath11 in the `` great wall '' defined as isolated , i.e. those whose nearest companion lies at a projected distance of more than 300 kpc .",
    "these two samples are used in the present investigation to derive frequency distributions which need to be extracted from a magnitude complete sample ( sects .",

    "the remaining objects observed in this work and/or found in the literature will be used only in those analysis which do not depend upon completeness ( sect .",

    "in this section we use the @xmath0 e.w .",
    "reported in tables 3 and 4 in order to study the relationship between the current star formation and other photometric properties of disk galaxies .",
    "first we show in fig . 5a the relation between the @xmath0 e.w . and the morphological type",

    ", we added to each class a random number between -0.3 and 0.3 .",
    "the majority of galaxies in our sample have small angular size ( 1 - 2 arcmin ) , thus the classification error is probably up to 2 bin in hubble type . in particular , due to the adopted classification scheme ( see column 12 of table 1 ) the pec objects might in fact belong to any of the earlier - type bins . nevertheless , in spite of the uncertainty on our classification , fig .",
    "5a shows a definite trend of @xmath0 e.w . with type .",
    "in fact the average @xmath0 e.w . among types",
    "sa is 5.3 @xmath34 1.9 @xmath35 , significantly lower than 24.5 @xmath34 3.3 @xmath35 found among types sc ( see also roberts & haynes 1994 and ktc94 ) .    to further investigate the reasons for the residual scatter found within each individual morphological class ( see fig .",
    "5a ) , we analyze the dependence of the @xmath0 e.w . on the galaxy s mass , a quantity carrying a more direct physical meaning than the hubble type .",
    "following gpb96 , we use the h band luminosity as a tracer of the dynamical mass of disk galaxies ( @xmath36 , solar units ) to show in fig . 5b that the @xmath0 e.w .",
    "decreases significantly with increasing mass .",
    "although the relation appears noisy and non - linear , low mass systems ( @xmath37 ) show high ( 40 @xmath17 ) average e.w .",
    ", weakly decreasing with mass . the one order of magnitude scatter found in this interval probably reflects the presence or the absence of episods of star formation of short duration which is governed primarily by the local gas instability ( see kennicutt , 1989 ) . at ( @xmath38 )",
    "the @xmath0 e.w .",
    "drops to zero , with an even higher scatter than in low mass regime .",
    "if one divides the data in 3 bins of decreasing @xmath0 ( @xmath39 ; @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ) the corresponding average @xmath42 are : 10.9 ; 10.4 ; 10.0 @xmath43 , i.e. an approximately inverse linear proportionality",
    ".      one of the most clear - cut results of gpb96 is that the presence in the near - infrared of centrally peaked structures ( bulges - nuclei ) strongly correlates with the total h ( 1.65 @xmath44 m ) luminosity or mass ( see their fig .",
    "these authors used the model - independent parameter @xmath45 , defined as the ratio of the radii containing respectively 75% and 25% of the total h band light , and found @xmath45 in the range 1 - 3 for pure disk objects , and @xmath46 in galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "given this result , it is important to investigate whether or not the inverse correlation between sfr and mass , reported in the previous section , follows from the anti - correlation between @xmath0 e.w . and @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , whether or not the @xmath0 e.w . is strong in pure disk galaxies and weak in bulge dominated galaxies , as claimed by devereux & young ( 1991 ) .",
    "however ktc94 showed that variations of @xmath0 e.w .",
    "do not simply reflect different contributions of bulge light to the continuum , but real variations of the disk sfr .",
    "points in fig . 5 a and b ( and in the following figures , unless otherwise specified )",
    "are coded according to @xmath45 : filled dots are pure disks , open symbols are bulge dominated systems and crosses indicate those objects for which no structural information is available .",
    "pure disks dominate the low @xmath47 - high @xmath0 - late - type regime .",
    "also in fig .",
    "6 ( a , b , c ) , where we plot the @xmath0 - @xmath47 relation in separate morphological type bins , the segregation according to @xmath45 is apparent , and enhanced in panels d and e.    it is evident that the quantities @xmath45 , @xmath0 , @xmath47 and morphological type are not independent of one another , as illustrated in fig .",
    ". however , while both @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "7a , extracted from fig .",
    "5b ) and @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "7b ) are strongly related with @xmath47 , the correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "7c ) is poorer : most disk galaxies ( @xmath483 ) have high sfr , but a significant fraction of them have @xmath491 .",
    "any value of @xmath0 e.w .",
    "is found among bulge - dominated objects .    in conclusion , we claim that the dependence of @xmath0 e.w . on mass ( h luminosity ) is not entirely induced by the dependence of the bulge - to - disk ratio on luminosity .",
    "the primary dependences are those of @xmath45 and of @xmath0 e.w . on mass , and the one of @xmath0 e.w .",
    "on @xmath45 follows as a consequence .    the secondary , marginal correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath45 implies , however , that in bulge - dominated systems the @xmath0 e.w .",
    "might not provide a reliable estimate of the disk sfr , as argued by devereux & young ( 1991 ) . since by definition the e.w .",
    "is computed from the @xmath0 net flux normalized to the red continuum , it would result artificially reduced by a strong contribution of the bulge to the continuum . to assess this important point we investigate the correlation between the @xmath0 e.w . and another sfr indicator , namely the @xmath0 surface brightness ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the latter parameter is defined as the ratio of the @xmath0 net line flux to the disk area ( computed using @xmath51 , the diameter measured in the b band at the 25  isophote ) .",
    "the normalizing area is independent of the bulge properties , thus @xmath50 should give a reliable estimate of the disk sfr . in fig .",
    "8 we plot ( adopting the usual symbols coded according to the bulge - to - disk ratio ) the two sfr parameters one against the other ( panel a ) : the two quantities are linearly correlated and disks and bulges are nicely segregated along the diagonal line . furthermore we show in fig .",
    "8b that the correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath47 is qualitatively similar to the one found between @xmath0 e.w . and @xmath47 ( fig",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 e.w .",
    "is marginally affected by the bulge contribution , thus it can be used as a reliable estimate of the integrated sfr .",
    "moreover another advantage of using @xmath0 e.w . over @xmath50",
    "is that the accuracy of the former is about 10% , while the uncertainty on the area determination , up to 100% , reflects into a similar uncertainty on @xmath50 .",
    "the analysis carried out in the previous section has shown that the sfr in disk galaxies is anti - correlated with their luminosity ( mass ) .",
    "this finding makes the determination of the characteristic sfr properties of galaxies meaningless , unless a luminosity range is specified , i.e. if samples selected according to well defined completeness criteria are used .",
    "the @xmath0 survey presented in this paper contains in fact a subsample complete to @xmath52 , being selected from a magnitude limited subsample complete down to @xmath1 , entirely composed of objects lying at a constant distance ( 70 mpc ) ( containing both isolated and cluster members ) . with these data",
    "we construct the frequency distribution of the @xmath0 e.w . in bins of log e.w.=0.4 , as given in fig .",
    "it appears that , for galaxies brighter than @xmath52 , the average @xmath0 e.w . is 22 @xmath34 2 @xmath17 .",
    "this value would increase if an intrinsically fainter sample was selected .",
    "the distribution peaks at e.w.=25 @xmath17 . over 40 % of galaxies have their e.w . in the range 16 - 40",
    "less than 15 % galaxies have null e.w .",
    ": these are either s0/s0a galaxies misclassified as spirals or high mass systems .",
    "given the conclusions of the previous sections , it also follows that the comparison between the sfr properties of galaxies found in and outside clusters is meaningful only for samples with equal limiting optical luminosity .",
    "the frequency distributions for two different samples , one consisting of 40 cluster members , the other of 66 isolated galaxies , both with a limiting magnitude @xmath1 , are compared in fig . 9b and c. in fig . 9b",
    "the membership is according to the criterion of column 10 of table 1 ( `` caustics '' ) , while in fig .",
    "9c the membership is according to the criterion of column 9 ( angular separation ) . as we can see from the latter figures , the distributions are insensitive to the adopted membership criterion .",
    "moreover no significant difference is found between the cluster distribution and that for the isolated galaxies , as derived using the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( the probability that the cluster and isolated distributions derive from the same parent population is 2.5 % ) .",
    "this indicates , contrary to common believe , that cluster spiral+irr galaxies have mean sfr values indistinguishable from those of the isolated objects .",
    "the histograms in fig .",
    "9 b and c suggest , however , that the cluster sample has a less pronounced peak at log @xmath0 e.w .",
    "= 1.4 than the isolated one .",
    "conversely there is a marginal evidence for an overabundance of intermediate @xmath0 e.w .",
    "( 0 - 10 @xmath17 ) among cluster objects . however , based upon the data in our possession , these differences are not statistically significant .    it is well known that late - type galaxies avoid the central regions of rich clusters .",
    "this is clearly the case in the coma cluster ( see andreon 1996 ) , and to a lesser extent in a1367 . it has been claimed that spirals at the periphery of the coma cluster have bluer than average color indices .",

    "if this reflects an enhanced sfr , it is expected that a similar pattern should show up in our data .",

    "points are coded according to @xmath47 to stress once more the inverse proportionality between sfr and mass .",

    "the shell contained between 1 and 2 degrees of projected radii around coma .",
    "however , we suggest that this effect is due to a mass segregation instead of a real enhancement of the sfr .",
    "in fact if we remove , to the first order , the luminosity ( mass ) dependence , by multiplying @xmath0 e.w . by the corresponding @xmath47 ( as derived in three intervals in section 5.1 ) , any evidence for radial gradients is canceled .",

    "the main results of the present work can be summarized as follows : i ) the present sfr properties of spiral galaxies , as derived from a representative sample of the local universe , increase with increasing hubble type.ii ) these properties do not show a significant dependence on the explored range of local galaxy density , spanning one order of magnitude between isolated supercluster objects and members of coma - like clusters .",
    "iii ) the present sfr shows a definite negative trend with the h band luminosity .",
    "the average @xmath0 e.w .",
    "increases from 0 to about 30 @xmath17 with decreasing log @xmath47 from 11 to 9 @xmath43 , i.e. with decreasing dynamical mass from log m = 11.5 to 9.5 @xmath54 .",
    "this statement holds strictely for disk galaxies included in the present analysis .",
    "nothing can be concluded about the mass dependence in e+s0s .",
    "@xmath0 e.w . depends also marginally on the bulge - to - disk ratio , but this comes as a consequence of a primary dependence of the bulge - to - disk ratio on @xmath47 .",
    "point ii ) does not mean that the environment is playing no role in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the existence of a strong morphology - density relation , i.e. the environmental dependence of the fraction of early to late - type galaxies , is out of question .",
    "the conclusion of the present work is that galaxies which retain a spiral - irr morphology at the present cosmological epoch have star formation properties which do not differ in and outside rich clusters .",
    "our observations do not rule out the possibility that galaxies in clusters form primarily as e+so and that spiral galaxies have only recently entered the dense cluster environment , falling inward .",
    "if @xmath55 is the time since their infall , @xmath56 is the hi depletion time - scale for ram - pressure ( estimated to few @xmath57 yrs by gavazzi 1989 ) and @xmath58 is the time - scale of the transformation from the atomic to the molecular phase , then we can only conclude that @xmath59 yrs , i.e. that these systems are still `` burning '' the molecular gas which was formed before they entered the cluster environment .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence that the molecular gas content of hi deficient galaxies in rich clusters is normal ( see e.g. boselli et al .",
    "it can not be excluded , however , that on a time - scale longer than @xmath58 these galaxies will run out of gas to fuel a substantial star formation rate , and hence they will progressively evolve into anemic systems .",
    "the result of point iii ) has deep implications on the models of galaxy evolution , following the line traced by gpb96 and gs96 and the seminal work of sandage ( 1986 ) .",
    "gpb96 and gs96 argued that the correlation found between the b - v , u - b , b - h and uv - v color indices , other population i indicators , and the galaxy mass follows from a basic dependence of galaxy evolution on the mass of their progenitor protogalaxies . adopting a closed - box model ( galaxies evolve out of the primeval gas , with some contribution from recycled gas ) these authors claim that the presently observed color indices are consistent with the idea that galaxies are coeval systems ( consistent with an age of 6.5 - 10 gyrs ) , and that the time dependence of their initial collapse ( sfr ) follows an exponential with the time constant @xmath26 inversely proportional to their mass , as @xmath60 .",
    "massive disk galaxies ( @xmath61 ) have a time constant as short as @xmath62 yrs , while low mass systems ( @xmath63 ) are consistent with a star formation history of @xmath64 yrs duration . adapting the model of gs96 to an age of 10 gyrs ( consistently with ktc94 ) the dependence of @xmath26 on mass :",
    "@xmath65 requires @xmath66=2.5 . combining this key argument with the model of ktc94 , which predicts the present sfr as a function of @xmath26",
    ", we can derive sfr as a function of mass , as represented with the broken line in fig .",
    "5b , 6 and 7a .",
    "we use the model of ktc94 restricted to the case of an exponentially declining sfr with time ( case b@xmath671 ) , assuming a salpeter imf and solar metallicity ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "the model @xmath0 e.w .",
    "are multiplied by 1.5 to account for the fact that the observed ones contain an equal contribution from the satellite [ nii ] lines ( kennicutt 1992 ) . the model prediction and the data are in good agreement .",
    "the sfr predicted by the model , instead , would fall short with respect to the observed values by a factor of 2 if a scalo instead of a salpeter imf was assumed , or if an extinction correction of about 1 mag , as discussed by ktc94 , was applyed .",
    "altogether we claim that the observed @xmath0 values are found in satisfactory agreement with those predicted by using the simple ( perhaps simplistic ) assumption that the time - scale of the single episode of star formation depends on the system mass as @xmath68 , without invoking recent bursts of star formation ( case b@xmath61 ) . in other words ,",
    "the best known pop i indicator , namely the present massive sfr , is predicted by means of a simple evolutionary model where the mass is the principal parameter governing the collapse time - scale of protogalaxies .",
    "massive galaxies had a short , intense burst of star formation shortly after their collapse , thus retaining little gas to fuel the present star formation .",
    "low - mass systems underwent a much longer , less spectacular episode of star formation , which is still transforming a significant fraction of gas into stars at the present cosmological epoch .",
    "we emphasize that the above argument applies strictly to disk ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "our evolutionary scenario has been confirmed by observations of faint galaxies at high redshift .",
    "quoting cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : `` the more massive forming galaxies seen at @xmath69 to 3 are identified as earlier type spirals , whose star formation rates are initially high and then decline rapidly at @xmath70 , while for later type spirals and smaller mass irregulars the star formation rates at @xmath70 are lower , and the formation process persists to redshifts much closer to the present epoch '' .",
    "togheter with gs96 we stress that from the present observations there is no compelling evidence that galaxies are not coeval systems , i.e. the epoch of their formation is a function of their mass , but that the duration of their collapse is inversely proportional to their mass .",
