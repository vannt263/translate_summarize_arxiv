    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are the primary sites of star birth in the galaxy . in particular , they appear essential for the formation of massive stars in ob associations . the rosette molecular cloud ( rmc ) , residing in the constellation of monoceros , is situated in the perseus arm of the galaxy .",
    "it has an extent of around 100pc ( dorland & montmerle 1987 ) and contains @xmath0  10@xmath1  m@xmath2 of gas & dust ( blitz & thaddeus 1980 ) .",
    "it is among the most massive gmcs in the galaxy and is associated with one of the most outstanding regions of massive star formation .",
    "the rosette nebula is located at the north - west tip of the gmc .",
    "it is a spectacular hii region of @xmath0  30pc in scale , famous for harboring one of the youngest ( @xmath0 3@xmath310@xmath4 yrs , ogura & ishida 1981 ) open clusters , ngc  2244 , and is itself being excavated by the strong stellar winds from the immersed ob stars at the center .",
    "the favorable orientation of the rosette nebula , perpendicular to the line of sight , and its prominent interaction with the ambient molecular cloud , provides an excellent opportunity to test the theory of sequential formation of ob clusters in gmcs ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ; lada 1987 ) .",
    "ngc  2244 is , on the other hand , located roughly at the center of the mon  ob2 association , which has a physical scale of up to 280pc ( blaauw 1964 ; singh & naranan 1979 ) .",
    "it represents the youngest subgroup of the ob association and extends @xmath0  20pc .",
    "another two subgroups of ob stars were identified and ages of the order of @xmath05 x 10@xmath5 yrs and a few 10@xmath6 yrs suggested ( turner 1976 ) .",
    "one of their members could have exploded into a type ii supernova and formed a supernova remnant ( snr ) , the monoceros loop ( davies , 1963 ; aharonian et al .",
    "however , the snr has a dynamical age of only 3 - 15 x 10@xmath7 yrs , and the shock front has probably just reached the edge of the rosette nebula and is , therefore , unlikely to be responsible for any on - going star formation activity in the rmc ( blitz & thaddeus 1980 ; townsley et al .",
    "nevertheless , the overall picture is that gmcs in the galactic disk are transitory objects , subject to sequential cluster formation .",
    "the rmc is highly clumped , as has been established through various observations from mid - infrared to radio wavelengths ( cox , deharveng & lenne 1990 ; blitz & stark 1986 ; williams , blitz & stark 1995 ; shipman & carey 1996 ; kuchar & bania 1993 ; celnik 1985 ) .",
    "it could be producing new generations of young stars and embedded clusters in its densest rim ( cox et al .",
    "1990 ; block , geballe & dyson 1993 ; carpenter , snell & schloerb et al . 1993 ; hanson , geballe & conti et al . 1993",
    "; phelps 1994 ) .",
    "patches of intensive x - ray emission spatially associated with the dense clumps , which is indicative of active star formation , were detected by gregorio - hetem , montmerle and casanova et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "phelps & lada ( 1997 ) have spotted , via visual inspection of near - infrared images , 7 aggregates of infrared stars , each associated with an iras point source .",
    "this demonstrated that star formation is continuing in this area in a distributed manner and different star formation mechanisms may be at work .",
    "unfortunately , a complete , unbiased census of star formation over the entire spatial extent of the rmc is not yet available .",
    "however , the 2mass jhks data permit us to identify and analyze considerably more embedded objects . a detailed , in - depth",
    "study will help to elucidate to what extent star or cluster formation is proceeding and provide clues as to what mechanisms are governing the star birth processes across this exceptional area .",
    "this letter explores a panorama of clustered star formation in the rmc .",
    "detailed studies of each well - defined region of cluster formation will be presented in a forthcoming series . in addition",
    ", the first infrared study of the young massive cluster , ngc 2244 , resolved into a combination of a twin cluster and a relic arc of slightly reddened young stars , will be discussed elsewhere ( li 2005 ) .",
    "archived data from the 2mass point source catalog ( psc ) and iras sky survey atlases ( issa ) were retrieved via irsa ( http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/ ) .",
    "iras hires images of the rmc were subsequently obtained by the email requesting system running at the ipac data center .",
    "the following sample selection criteria were employed to guarantee the reliability of the 2mass data in use .",
    "( 1 ) each source extracted from the 2mass psc must have a certain detection in all three of the j , h , and ks bands .",
    "( 2 ) we restrict the ks band signal to noise ratio to values above 15 to tightly constraint field stars in the control field to the main sequence loci on the ( j - h ) to ( h - ks ) diagram ( li & smith 2005a ) .",
    "however , the flux and resolution limited 2mass survey , and our stringent selection criteria , will in combination result in drawbacks .",
    "firstly , the number of proto - ob stars that are deeply embedded can be underestimated .",
    "this is likely to occur in the densest regions with the highest extinction .",
    "secondly , this work is limited to the study of comparatively high mass cloud members . with a 90@xmath8 completeness limit to @xmath0",
    "0.8  m@xmath2 objects , many disk stars with masses above this limit can be trimmed off .",
    "even in a single near - infrared band , two separate regions of significant stellar density enhancement are readily identified .",
    "one of these stellar concentrations coincides with the young open cluster ngc 2244 and the other corresponds spatially to the densest rim of the rmc .",
    "the latter has no known optical counterparts and is therefore likely to be a recently formed embedded , compact cluster .    however , when this distribution is plotted as a function of h - ks color , fine structure signifying large scale clustering becomes evident throughout the south - east quadrant ( fig .",
    "positions of previously identified embedded clusters and young massive stars are overplotted in fig .  1 . these are spatially associated with the majority of the stellar concentrations in the plot , indicating the young , embedded nature of the clustering of reddened sources .",
    "the candidate embedded clusters are further divided into four major groups a , b , c & d , partially according to their distinct concentrated appearance and their association with dense clumps as outlined by the iras 100 @xmath9 m emission ( cox et al .",
    "1990 ) and co detections ( blitz & thaddeus 1980 ; williams et al .",
    "the majority of the candidate young stars are either congregated within the outlined regions in fig .  1 or appear as minor stellar aggregates not identified in this paper .",
    "only a small fraction of the sources identified here with heavy line of sight extinction are found to be in a wide scattered distribution and are to be attributed to isolated formation .",
    "color - color diagrams of each of the four regions are presented in fig .",
    "2 . about one sixth to a fourth of the 2mass sources in each region are found to be located to the right of the reddening band of normal field stars .",
    "these sources thus possess intrinsic color excesses originating from emission from circumstellar dust , commensurate with their embedded nature .",
    "a concentration of background giants along the left edge of the reddening band directly above the giants track is apparent on the color - color diagram for at least region d , which covers the largest area in the rmc .",
    "this indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of extinction for the cloud that ranges mainly between 210  mag . in the densest clumps ,",
    "however , visual extinction can even exceed 25  mag .",
    "this confirms the very clumpy nature of the molecular cloud and is consistent with a high clump to interclump density contrast ( schneider et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we attempt to eliminate foreground sources , which possess a typical color of ( h - ks ) @xmath0 0.2 mag based on a detailed investigation of the reference fields ( li & smith 2005a ) .",
    "apparent background giants concentrated within an elliptical area on the color - color diagrams can also be excluded .",
    "the fraction of excess emission sources then remaining in each region amounts to between one third and a half .",
    "this provides convincing evidence that the majority of the reddened sources are embedded young stars still associated with their parental clouds .",
    "we thus confirm the unprecedented widespread presence of forming clusters embedded in the rmc .    a close correspondence of the compact subclusters in each region with the distribution of the most luminous iras sources ( cox et al . 1990 ) and the densest clumps ( williams et al .",
    "1995 ) is clearly shown in fig .",
    "1 . this suggests a ` multi - seeded ' origin of the embedded clusters in the fragmented interaction layer of the hii region and at various places deep into the molecular complex .",
    "the term multi - seeded is introduced to describe a situation in which the formation of clusters in distinct clumps in a distributed manner is proceeding in parallel . on the other hand ,",
    "clustered star formation is taking place both in isolation in the swept - up shells and in a more structured mode further away from ngc  2244 .",
    "the structured mode surprisingly continues down to the south - east boundary of the rmc .",
    "the embedded nature of a source is thought to be fully substantiated if it meets the following two criteria .",
    "these are ( 1 ) an intrinsic color excess in the near infrared i.e. e(h - ks ) @xmath10 0 and ( 2 ) a ( h - ks ) color of greater than 0.2 .",
    "this again helps to exclude possible contamination from the foreground . in this manner ,",
    "some 30 excessive emission sources were removed from our sample .",
    "a clear density enhancement of embedded young stars toward the outlined regions remains as evidence for a non - random distribution of young stellar objects across the extincted areas .",
    "in addition , the surface density of excess emission sources ranges from an average of 0.55 pc@xmath11 over the entire extent of the rmc to @xmath0 23 pc@xmath11 for the compact subclusters in region c where the process of star formation is probably still going on .",
    "an investigation of the properties of each embedded cluster was carried out and the results are summarized in table 1 . the analysis included the construction of near infrared color - color and color - magnitude diagrams and the calculation of the ks luminosity function ( klf ) . an example color - magnitude diagram for objects in the region c cluster",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "both components of the known binary system afgl 961 are identified as candidate proto - o stars ( for a detailed analysis , see li & smith , 2005b ) and are indicated with asterisks .",
    "the east component of afgl 961 , presumably a single object , is shown to have a possible mass of up to @xmath0 130 m@xmath2 .",
    "it is probably one of the most massive protostars forming in the complex .",
    "a nearby progenitor o star , represented on the diagram with a solid square , may prove to be a third component of the system because of its close proximity to afgl  961 within a projected distance of 0.2 pc ( li & smith 2005b ) .",
    "the clusters embedded in regions a & b are spatially coincident with the fragmented arcs of the swept - up layer ( fig . 1 & 4a ) of the hii region associated with ngc  2244 , an emerging young open cluster known to have a turn - off age of @xmath0 2  myrs ( park & sung 2002 ) .",
    "based on a klf study of the regions a & b clusters , an age estimate of @xmath0 1  myr is obtained by comparing to klfs of embedded clusters with known ages ( lada & lada 1995 ) . at a distance of @xmath0 20 pc away from the center of ngc  2244 ,",
    "the age of the shell clusters in regions a & b is consistent with probably their triggered nature by the shocked wave associated with the ionization front of the hii region , which propagates at a velocity of @xmath0 20 km  s@xmath12 ( smith 1973 ) .",
    "no prominent age spread between the sub - clusters or aggregates in regions c & d can be quantitatively addressed based on a study of the klf .",
    "however , we suggest that the group of proto - o stars associated with afgl 961 , situated in the south - east of region c ( fig .",
    "1 ) , is probably among the latest episodes of star and cluster formation . due to their estimated high masses and their protostellar origin",
    ", this proto - o star system may have ages of less than a few 10@xmath7 yrs ( hanson et al .",
    "1993 ) . at a distance of @xmath0 15 pc from the interface with the rosette nebula",
    ", its location in the densest ridge of the rmc probably signifies the gestation of new generation ob clusters following the emergence of ngc  2244 .",
    "as a comparison , we have derived the distributions of optical depth at 100 @xmath9 m and color temperature based on the iras issa ( fig . 4a & b , for an introduction of the methods used , see li & chen 1996 ) .",
    "the outlined regions a & b are spatially coincident with the swept - up layer of the rosette nebula , and region c with the densest rim of the rmc .",
    "however , region d is found through the plots to have comparatively lower extinction ( fig .",
    "4a ) , in agreement with results from the co & c@xmath13o detections ( blitz & stark 1986 ; williams et al .",
    "1995 ) . the dust temperatures , however , are between 25 and 41  k ( fig .",
    "4b ) , comparable to other regions of cluster formation .",
    "star formation is evidenced by our study to be occurring in an extensive and regulated way across the south - east section of the rmc .",
    "this refines the picture introduced by cox et al .",
    "it is taking place within a selected spread but not all of the clumpy area of region d ( fig .",
    "4a ) , as is illustrated by the stellar distribution and the overplotted continuous lines in fig .  5",
    "nevertheless , it follows a structured pattern that first developed along the major axis of the rmc , in parallel to the perseus arm in the galactic plane ( fig .",
    "the pattern , resembling a tree in structure , is related to the gas filaments of the cloud ( williams et al .",
    "1995 ) , but does not seem to break where the clumps or filaments do . this indicates the existence of some underlining tracks .",
    "a schematic model is thus invoked to interpret the widespread star and cluster formation activity in regions c & d of the rmc and , perhaps , the south - east half of the complex as a whole .",
    "large scale turbulence is suggested to originate from the spiral density wave of the galaxy ( woodward 1976 ) or tidal force dissipation of the clouds in the perseus arm .",
    "additional turbulence is injected from internal sources , through a combination of feedback effects from the young massive stars in ngc 2244 and region c , especially the violent outflow activity related to the formation of the proto - o stars associated with afgl 961 ( lada & gautier 1982 ) .",
    "the perturbations trigger the collapse of clumps , and star formation consequently occurs along tracks following the decay of the macroturbulence , tracing out a tree pattern .    in the frame of the proposed tree model ,",
    "the rich massive cluster embedded in region c is spatially coincident with the bulk of the co emission of the complex ( blitz & thaddeus 1980 ; blitz & stark 1986 ; williams et al .",
    "1995 ) and constitutes the root of the tree .",
    "it harbors the most massive protostars in the complex and perhaps also among those known in the galaxy .",
    "medium mass clusters and loose aggregates with stellar masses of up to @xmath0 50 m@xmath2 are developing down to the south - east boundary of the complex .",
    "these correspond to the branches .",
    "this scenario is supported by simulations of decaying supersonic turbulence , in which the decay follows a period of energy pumping and compression ( mac low & klessen 2004 ) , but in this case it corresponds to wider or even galactic scales .",
    "this extensive study of the rmc has , for the first time , incorporated into the scenario of sequential formation of ob clusters in gmcs the involvement of medium to low mass stars which , in combination , reveal a more complex nature .",
    "we argue that the history of cluster formation associated with the rmc , though in a sequential manner both in space and time , is better interpreted in terms of sequential collapse of dense clumps along the major axis of the gmc .",
    "the collapsed regions outline tracks of the decay of macroturbulence rather than having been exclusively triggered by the interference of former generations of ob clusters of the mon ob2 association .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for constructive comments which improved the scientific presentation of the paper .",
    "we thank prof .",
