    "entanglement constitutes the single most characteristic property that makes quantum mechanics distinct from any classical theory @xcite .",

    "it has been recognized that entanglement forms a fundamental resource for quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite . for application s purposes",
    ", it became essential to quantify entanglement and , accordingly , a number of useful measures of the degree of entanglement have been introduced @xcite .",
    "one of them , the _ entanglement of formation _",
    "@xcite , is the subject of this paper .",
    "the entanglement of formation quantifies the resources needed to create a given entangled state .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of the entanglement of formation in a quantum measurement model which is a slightly modified version of our model , proposed previously @xcite .",
    "we are interested in how the entanglement of formation is created and lost during the course of the measurement .",
    "environmentally induced decoherence prevents us from observing quantum effects in the macroscopic world @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown that it is possible to greatly reduce the decoherence rate by assuming the environment to be a squeezed reservoir @xcite .",
    "this enables us to observe violations of bell - type inequalities in phase space even when the meter is already in the macroscopic domain .",
    "the entanglement of formation and , in particular , the closely related concurrence allows us to find the full time - dependence of the maximum possible violation of bell - type inequalities .",
    "we will show how the dynamics of the concurrence is affected by coupling to a squeezed reservoir and present an analytical study of the dynamics of the entanglement of formation of decoherent , non - orthogonal and mixed qubits exposed to an open environment .",
    "we also address the question as to what extent violations of the bell inequalities represent a good measure of the degree of entanglement .",
    "we find that not only the degree of mixture of bipartite qubits plays a role but also the degree of overlap between them .",
    "in particular , the meter generates a non - orthogonal and mixed qubit which can be rewritten as a superposition of orthogonal qubit states .",
    "surprisingly , in this context , violations of the bell inequalities can be stronger in a system which , compared to other systems , has a larger degree of mixture but the same amount of entanglement of formation .",
    "we explain this apparently contradictory behavior on the basis of the measurement model .",

    ".  [ sec.3 ] , we derive the concurrence and the entanglement of formation and discuss the time evolution of these quantities for different squeezing parameters of the environment .",

    "the trapped four - level atom is driven in a raman configuration with two classical , @xmath2-polarized laser fields of frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the laser frequencies are off - resonant with respect to the electronic @xmath2-transitions @xmath15 and @xmath16 by a detuning of @xmath11 ( @xmath17 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig . 2 ] .",
    "a similar `` system - meter '' interaction was investigated by wallentowitz and vogel @xcite , in order to realize the quantum - mechanical counterpart of nonlinear optical phenomena in the motional ( mechanical ) degrees of freedom .",

    "since the lasers are strongly detuned from the atomic transition frequencies the atom stays in its ground states during the interaction .",
    "further , if we assume the resolved sideband limit , we are able to influence the motional quantum state of the atom in a controlled manner .",
    "in particular , the system - meter interaction hamiltonian , @xmath20 , for the given geometry and frequencies of the lasers in the vibrational rotating - wave approximation is given as @xcite @xmath21 here , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lamb - dicke parameter , @xmath24 is the dipole moment which we assume to be the same for all possible dipole transitions in the four - level atom , and @xmath25 are the electric field amplitudes of the applied lasers .",

    "the replacement of the optical meter by the mechanical one in the system - meter interaction has considerable advantages in the realization of the measurement model .",
    "in particular , the experimental progress in reservoir engineering for trapped ions @xcite makes this measurement model a feasible testing ground of decoherence effects in engineered reservoirs .",

    "there are several good measures of the degree of entanglement for both pure and mixed quantum states @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most seminal one is the _ entanglement of formation _ which quantifies the resources needed to _ create _ an entangled state @xcite .",

    "based on the previous considerations , a number of interesting questions arise with respect to our measurement model concerning the generation of the entanglement of formation and its dynamical properties . among them",

    "another one is the determination of the maximum possible violation of the bell inequality ( [ eq2.14 ] ) and the time when it is achieved in the measurement .    to answer these questions",
    "it is essential to recognize that the potentially entangled system - meter state consists of _ nonorthogonal _ `` qubits '' . in particular , the squeezed coherent states @xmath46 of the meter are not completely orthogonal during the course of the measurement process .",
    "it is , however , possible to define concurrence and , consequently , entanglement of formation for nonorthogonal bipartite systems by introducing an orthonormal basis in the two subsystems of the bipartite state @xcite . in the measurement model under consideration the orthonormal , time - dependent basis for the meter is formed by @xmath88 \\left(1-e^{-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}}\\right ) , \\label{eq2.18 } \\\\",

    "one can get some insight as to what extent a violation of the bell inequality tells us something about the nature of entanglement @xcite .",

    "3 ] ) . thus , this system contradicts the statement by munro _",
    "we get a larger violation of the bell inequality in a system having the same degree of entanglement but , at the same time , more mixedness than the other system .",
    "we suggest the following explanation for this apparently peculiar behavior .",
    "it is the overlap between the nonorthogonal meter states that reduces the maximum possible violation , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.22a ] ) . in order to violate the bell inequality it is necessary for the components of the state of the composite system to be distinguishable .",
    "when the degree of distinguishability gets smaller the amount of the maximum possible violation of the bell inequality will also be reduced .",
    "this explains why the difference of the maximum possible violations of the bell inequality in fig .",
    "5 ] is slightly larger than zero in spite of the fact that system @xmath99 is more mixed but has the same amount of entanglement as system @xmath107 .",
    "obviously , the overlap of the meter states of system @xmath107 at this particular time is much larger than that of system @xmath99",
    ". this observation can give a novel direction to investigations of the problem as to what extent the bell inequality is a measure of entanglement and connects it not only with mixedness but also with the degree of indistinguishability of nonorthogonal qubits .",
    "in summary , we have investigated dynamical properties of the entanglement of formation in a measurement model .",
    "we have also demonstrated the ability to influence the time evolution of the entanglement of formation by a squeezed reservoir and found a way to maintain this nonclassical property in a macroscopic domain of the meter , in spite of it being monitored by the environment .",
    "furthermore , this model gives some insight into dynamical properties of the entanglement of decoherent and nonorthogonal entangled qubits which is of central interest in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that it is possible to implement this measurement model with a trapped `` four - level '' @xmath8-ion @xcite which is exposed to engineered reservoirs @xcite .",
    "in addition , it seems , at least in principle , possible to directly measure the concurrence with time - dependent pauli spin - flip operators .",
    "the present measurement model is well suited to study the entanglement of formation in dissipative environments and helps to clarify some of the underlying physical principles . in particular , it gives new insights into the question as to what extent the bell inequality is a measure of entanglement and explains how to get larger amounts of violation in a system with more mixedness but the same amount of entanglement as a reference system .",

    "<S> a similar measurement model was employed to test decoherence effects on quantum nonlocality in phase space on the basis of coincidence measurements of the entangled system - meter scheme . here , we study the effects of decoherence on the entanglement of formation characterized by the concurrence . </S>",
    "<S> the concurrence of the system enables to find the maximum possible violation of the bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this model gives illustrative insights into the question to what extend the bell inequality can be considered as a measure of entanglement . </S>"
