    "asking two distant parties that do not communicate for certain set of answers is the well known scenario for a non - local game @xcite . depending on the resource the parties share ,",
    "they can obtain higher or lower probability of success in winning the game .",
    "sharing a quantum state can allow for the probability higher with respect to classical resources , and sharing arbitrary non - local but not - signaling system can make it sometimes even equal to 1 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , among others , the non - locality represented by the so called box ( a conditional probability distribution ) has been treated as a resource in recent years @xcite .",
    "the world of non - signaling , non - local boxes bares analogy with the world of entangled states @xcite .",
    "therefore it is clear , that investigation of non - locality and entanglement can help each other .",
    "we develop this analogy , in the scenario of distinguishing between systems ( see in this context @xcite ) . namely we consider scenario in which two distant parties know that they share a box drawn from some ensemble .",
    "their task is to tell the box they share with as high probability as it is possible , using allowed class of operations . in our case , these operations will be such that transform local boxes into local ones and has this property even when tensored with identity operation .    an analogous scenario in entanglement theory",
    "was considered in recent years ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , where one asks about discriminating orthogonal quantum states by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) . in our method , we base on one of the first results on this subject @xcite , where it was shown that one can not distinguish between 4 bell states @xmath1 indeed , if alice and bob could distinguish the bell states on system ab , they could transform the states on cd into the singlet state by local control operations , that transform each of @xmath2 into @xmath3 which would mean that distillable entanglement of @xmath4 is at least 1 e - bit .",
    "this contradicts the fact that the state @xmath4 is separable as it can be written as @xmath5 .",
    "hence the states @xmath6 can not be perfectly distinguishable .    in what follows , we consider an analogue of the above state ( [ eq:4bells ] ) , based on the so called isotropic boxes @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , i.e. boxes that are mixtures of popescu - rohrlich ( pr ) boxes and anti pr box with probability @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "i=0^n-1 p_i b_ab^_ib_cd^_i .",
    "a class of operations we consider is similar to that of locality preserving @xcite but we demand also completeness i.e. that the operations should be locality preserving even when tensored with identity operation on some part of a box .",
    "moreover we demand that they have special output i.e. that they are _ discriminating _ operations . as a monotone",
    "we choose a _ nonlocal cost _ of a box @xcite .",
    "we also show that with help of these operations one can distinguish any 2 extremal boxes in @xmath0 case and any local extremal bipartite box with 2 inputs and 2 outputs from any other extremal box of this form for arbitrary cardinalities of inputs and outputs .",
    "this partially resembles result of @xcite from entanglement theory where it is proven that any two orthogonal ( multipartite ) states can be perfectly distinguished .",

    "in this section , we apply the _ comparing operations _ to distinguish some boxes perfectly , i.e. with @xmath197 .",

    "we also prove , that in case of 2 inputs and 2 outputs , whatever the cardinality of inputs and outputs , any local extremal box is distinguishable from any extremal box , by these operations .    for any two bipartite boxes",
    "@xmath198 compatible with each other , there is a lower bound on probability of success in distinguishing them when provided with equal probabilities , via clp operation : + 14_x , y[_a , b |p_x_1(a , b|x , y ) - p_x_2(a , b|x , y)| ]    _ proof_. the proof is due to the fact that comparing operations given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exclp ] ) of appendix , are clp .",
    "this means that the parties can choose the best measurement @xmath199 and then group the results according to helstrom optimal measurement @xcite , which attains the variational distance between the conditional probability distributions @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "we now turn to special case , where we discriminate only between extremal boxes .",
    "the intuition is that they should be to some extent distinguishable , and this is the case as we show below .",
    "we first focus on @xmath0 case because they are extremal ( similarly like pure quantum states ) . in what follows , by support of a box @xmath202",
    ", we will mean the following set : e \\{(a , b , x , y ) : p_e(a , b|x , y ) > 0}.    any two @xmath0 extremal boxes are perfectly distinguishable by some clp operation .    _",
    "proof_.    it is easy to see that each local boxes are distinguishable among others since by locality they need to have disjoined support of some probability distributions , and measuring this probability distribution determines which local box we have . for other cases",
    "the proof boils down to checking that there always exists a pair of entries @xmath203 and @xmath204 such that the resulting probability distributions for two extremal boxes have disjoined support .",
    "hence , upon a _ comparing operation _ which starts from measuring this pair of entries , the boxes are perfectly distinguishable .",
    "in order to partially generalize this result to the case of larger dimensions , we now observe general property of extremal boxes : support of one can not be contained in the support of the other or else the latter would not be extremal .    for any two extremal @xmath16-partite boxes @xmath205 of the same dimensionality , there is @xmath206 .",
    "[ lem : ext - dis ]    _",
    "proof_. for clarity , we state the proof for a bipartite boxes , since that for @xmath16-partite , following similar lines .",
    "suppose by contradiction , that @xmath207 . then if all probabilities of @xmath208 are less than or equal to corresponding probabilities of @xmath209 ( for every measurement )",
    ", then @xmath210 .",
    "if there was some @xmath211 such that p_e_1(a_0,b_0|x_0,y_0 ) < p_e_2(a_0,b_0|x_0,y_0 ) , then _ a , b p_e_1(a , b|x_0,y_0 ) < _ a , b p_e_2(a , b|x_0,y_0 ) = 1 , which is a contradiction since @xmath212 is a probability distribution .",
    "thus we may safely assume that there exists @xmath211 such that p_e_1(a_0,b_0|x_0,y_0 ) >",
    "p_e_2(a_0,b_0|x_0,y_0 ) . let us denote @xmath213 , and @xmath214 by the above consideration we have that r_1_(a , b , x , y ) e_2 t is well defined , and by definition satisfies @xmath215 .",
    "moreover , for r_2_(a , b , x , y ) e_1 s there is @xmath216 as it follows from : @xmath217 . by positivity of @xmath218 and from the above inequality we have @xmath219 satisfies",
    "@xmath220 i.e. it can be interpreted as non - trivial probability .",
    "this however gives , that is a valid box .",
    "indeed , for all @xmath221 there is p_e_1(a , b|x , y ) r_1r_2 p_e_2(a , b|x , y ) [ eq : order ] since either @xmath222 , and then @xmath223 gives the above inequality , or @xmath224 and then @xmath225 and @xmath226 . in the latter case , by definition of @xmath227",
    "there is @xmath228 , while @xmath229 by definition of @xmath230 , which proves ( [ eq : order ] ) .",
    "the box @xmath231 is also non - signaling , as a difference of two ( unnormalized ) non - singalling boxes .",
    "in turn , there is : e_2 = p e_1 + ( 1-p ) hence @xmath209 is a non - trivial mixture of two non - signaling boxes .",
    "this is desired contradiction , since @xmath209 is by assumption an extremal box , hence the assertion follows .    to state the result that follows from the above lemma",
    ", we need a definition of conclusive distinguishing :    we say that a multipartite box @xmath14 can be conclusively distinguished from a multipartite box @xmath232 compatible with @xmath14 , with nonzero probability if for there exists measurement @xmath233 such that there exist(s ) outcome(s ) @xmath234 for which @xmath235 but @xmath236 for all @xmath61 .",
    "we then say that @xmath14 is conclusively distinguishable from @xmath232 with at least probability @xmath108 .    from lemma [ lem : ext - dis ]",
    "it direcly follows that    for any two extremal multipartite boxes @xmath205 of the same dimensions , @xmath208 can be conclusively distinguished from @xmath209 with nonzero probability .",
    "note , that the above theorem is symmetric in a sense that @xmath209 can also be conclusively distinguished from @xmath208 with nonzero probability , but there may be no common measurement that allows for simultaneous conclusive distinguishing @xmath208 from @xmath209 and @xmath209 from @xmath208 with nonzero probability .",
    "in special case when at least one of the extremal boxes is local in case of 2 inputs and 2 outputs , again using lemma [ lem : ext - dis ] we obtain the following fact :    any extremal bipartite box with two inputs of arbitrary cardinalities @xmath237 and @xmath238 and two outputs of arbitrary cardinalities @xmath239 and @xmath240 is perfectly distinguishable from any extremal local bipartite box of the same dimensions by clp operation .    _",
    "proof_. fix arbitrarily a pair : an extremal box @xmath202 and a local extremal box @xmath119 .",
    "note , that in bipartite case of 2 inputs and 2 outputs any extremal local box is deterministic i.e. is a family of @xmath241 distributions with single entry equal to 1 , and all others zero . by lemma [ lem : ext - dis ] for some measurement @xmath242 , the support of distribution @xmath243 is not contained within the support of @xmath244 which means in this case , that these supports are disjoined .",
    "this implies that @xmath119 is conclusively distinguishable from @xmath202 and vice versa for the same measurement with probability 1 , hence the probability of success of discrimination between them equals 1 .",
    "we have extended a paradigm of distinguishing entangled states to the world of boxes .",
    "we have considered distinguishing of isotropic boxes , and provided easy linear program that gives the bound on the probability of success of discrimination among them by means of completely locality preserving operations which discriminates the ensemble . as a corollary we obtained bounds for the probability of success of discrimination of maximally nonlocal boxes as well as isotropic boxes with the same parameter .",
    "the bound is obtained in terms non - local cost of special input box : the mixture of classically correlated copies of boxes that are to be discriminated . the key argument in this result was monotonicity of non - local cost under clp operations .",
    "we have shown also an example of useful clp operation which is the _ comparing operation _ : local measurement followed by communication of the results , grouping them according to some partition and tracing out the results .",
    "we proved that it can help in discriminating between pairs of extremal boxes in bipartite case for any pairs in @xmath0 case , or between any local extremal box and any other extremal local boxes in bipartite case of boxes with 2 inputs and 2 outputs of arbitrary cardinalities",
    ". it would be interesting if application of other monotone then non - locality cost would give better upper bounds .",
    "note , that comparing operation is not the only one possible for boxes , as e.g. one could apply wiring between the parties @xcite .",
    "finally , we have to stress , that presented upper bounds on probability of success should be considered rather as a demonstration of analogy between entanglement and non - locality - two resource theories .",
    "this is because the bounds seems to be very rough , as most probably discriminating between two boxes perfectly by means of clp e.g. between pr box and anti pr box , is the best strategy when one is given mixture of more than two maximally non - local boxes",
    ". this strategy yields probability of success equal to @xmath245 when @xmath246 , which is far from obtained bounds .",
    "it would be then interesting if one could find more tight ones , perhaps using more direct approach by considering general form of lp operations @xcite than via monotones presented here .",

    "we first need to check that control-@xmath161 operation preserves locality on special class of local boxes , that appear in our considerations .",
    "namely , consider a local box _",
    "i p_i p_i(a , c|x , u)p_i(b , d|y , v ) where inputs @xmath203 and @xmath204 are unary .",

    "a(u))p_i(b , g_b(d)|y,_b(v ) ) where functions @xmath247 are either identity or a bitflip respectively .",
    "hence , the output box is a mixture of local boxes , we only need to check that @xmath248 and @xmath249 are fully non - signaling .",
    "it holds , indeed , as unary input can not signal ,",
    "while _ c p_i(a , h_a(c)|x,_a(u_0 ) ) = p_i(a , h_a(c)|x,_a(u_1 ) ) for any @xmath250 and values @xmath251 and @xmath252 , as for fixed @xmath250 @xmath253 just permutes the inputs , while @xmath254 changes order of summation , keeping the range of @xmath255 , hence the thesis follows from non - signaling of box @xmath256 .",
    "next step is to show that control-@xmath161 operation transforms non - signaling boxes into non - signaling ones .",
    "there are 5 inequivalent ways to distinguish a subsystem out of a box of the form _",
