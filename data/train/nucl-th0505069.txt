    "the statistical hadron gas approach to nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and recent review @xcite ) is rather successful in describing the data on particle multiplicities in a wide range of the collision energies .",
    "usually one considers a thermal system created in a+a collision in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "the canonical ensemble ( ce ) @xcite or even the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) @xcite has been used in order to describe the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions when a small number of secondary particles are produced . in all these cases ,",
    "the statistical systems are far away from the thermodynamic limit , so the statistical ensembles are not equivalent and exact charge conservation or both energy and charge conservation laws have to be taken into account .",
    "the ce is relevant also for systems with a large number of produced particles , e.g. , a large number of resultant pions or large nucleon number in p+a collisions , but a small ( of the order of 1 or smaller ) number of carriers of conserved charges , such as strange hadrons @xcite , antibaryons @xcite or charmed hadrons @xcite .",
    "this may happen not only in elementary but also in p+a or even a+a collisions .",
    "the analysis of the fluctuations is a useful tool to study the properties of the system created during high energy particle and nuclear collisions ( see , e.g .",
    ", refs . @xcite and the review papers @xcite ) . in a+a collisions",
    "one prefers to use the gce because it is the most convenient one from the technical point of view and due to the fact that both the ce and mce are equivalent to the gce in the thermodynamic limit when the size of the system tends to infinity .",
    "however , the thermodynamic equivalence of ensembles means only that the _ average values _ of physical quantities calculated in different ensembles are equal to each other in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it was demonstrated for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite that _ multiplicity fluctuations _ are different in the ce and gce even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these results have been then verified and extended in refs .",
    "the particle number fluctuations in the mce have been considered in our paper @xcite and they have been shown to be different from the gce results even in the thermodynamic limit .    in this paper",
    "we present a new method for the study of particle number distribution in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the method is based on the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of moments of the particle number distribution .",
    "in contrast to the previously used microscopic correlator approach @xcite , the new method is more rigorous , consistent and mathematically justified .",
    "it elucidates some subtleties . along with fluctuations",

    "expressions ( [ np - aver ] ) and ( [ np - fluc ] ) are microscopic in a sense that they describe the average values and fluctuation of a single mode with momentum @xmath3 .",
    "however , the fluctuations of macroscopic quantities of the system can be determined through the fluctuations of these single modes . to be more precise",
    ", we will demonstrate that the fluctuations can be written in terms of the microscopic correlator @xmath24 .",
    "this correlator can be presented as : @xmath25 the variance @xmath26 of the total number of particles , @xmath27 , equals to : @xmath28 we have assumed above that the quantum @xmath3-levels are non - degenerate .",

    "this does not change the above formulation because of statistical independence of these quantum sub - levels .",

    "it then follows that the probability distribution for the fluctuations inside @xmath48 should be gaussian .",
    "in fact , we always convolve @xmath46 with some smooth function of @xmath3 , so instead of writing the gaussian distribution for the sum of @xmath46 in @xmath48 we can use it directly for @xmath43",

    "the conserved quantity @xmath53 ( the energy and/or conserved charge ) can be written in the form @xmath54 .",
    "an exact conservation law means the restriction on the set of occupation numbers @xmath42 : only those which satisfy the condition @xmath55 can be realized .",
    "let us consider exact energy conservation .",

    "the method considered above has several serious limitations    * the probability distribution for @xmath85 was replaced by the gaussian distribution ( [ gauss ] ) , but in fact , this two distributions are very different .",
    "it is enough to mention that the real distribution is a discrete , and the gaussian one is continuous .",
    "although the arguments given after the equation ( [ gauss ] ) suggest that this replacement does not influence the final result in the thermodynamic limit , still , it would be nice to have a more rigorous justification of this fact as well as a recipe for the treatment of finite - size corrections in quantum systems . *",
    "the exact energy conservation influences not only fluctuations , but also the average values @xmath51 and @xmath86 , and this should result in microcanonical corrections to @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the case of finite - volume systems .",

    "<S> a new method is proposed for a treatment of ideal quantum gases in the microcanonical ensemble near the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the method allows rigorous asymptotic calculations of the average number of particles and particle number fluctuations in the microcanonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> it gives also the finite - volume corrections due to exact energy conservation for the total average number of particles and for higher moments of the particle number distribution in a system approaching the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> a present consideration confirms our previous findings that the scaled variance for particle number fluctuations in the microcanonical ensemble is different from that in the grand canonical ensemble even in the thermodynamic limit . </S>"
