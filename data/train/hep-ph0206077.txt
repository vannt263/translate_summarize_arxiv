    "there is by now convincing evidence , from the experimental study of atmospheric and solar neutrinos @xcite , for the existence of at least two distinct frequencies of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this in turn implies non vanishing neutrino masses and a mixing matrix , in analogy with the quark sector and the ckm matrix .",
    "so apriori the study of masses and mixings in the lepton sector should be considered at least as important as that in the quark sector .",
    "but actually there are a number of features that make neutrinos especially interesting .",
    "in fact the smallness of neutrino masses is probably related to the fact that @xmath0 are completely neutral ( i.e. they carry no charge which is exactly conserved ) and are majorana particles with masses inversely proportional to the large scale where lepton number ( l ) conservation is violated .",
    "majorana masses can arise from the see - saw mechanism @xcite , in which case there is some relation with the dirac masses , or from higher - dimensional non - renormalisable operators which come from a different sector of the lagrangian density than any other fermion mass terms .",
    "the relation with l non conservation and the fact that the observed neutrino oscillation frequencies are well compatible with a large scale for l non - conservation , points to a tantalizing connection with grand unified theories ( cut s ) .",
    "so neutrino masses and mixings can represent a probe into the physics at gut energy scales and offer a different perspective on the problem of flavour and the origin of fermion masses .",
    "there are also direct connections with important issues in astrophysics and cosmology as for example baryogenesis through leptogenesis @xcite and the possibly non - negligible contribution of neutrinos to hot dark matter in the universe .    at present",
    "there are many alternative models of neutrino masses .",
    "this variety is mostly due to the considerable experimental ambiguities that still exist .",
    "the most crucial questions to be clarified by experiment are whether the lsnd signal @xcite will be confirmed or will be excluded and which solar neutrino solution will eventually be established .",
    "if lsnd is right we probably need at least four light neutrinos , if not we can do with only the three known ones .",
    "which solar solution is correct fixes the corresponding mass squared difference and the associated mixing angle .",
    "another crucial unknown is the absolute scale of neutrino masses .",
    "this is in turn related to as diverse physical questions as the possible cosmological relevance of neutrinos as hot dark matter or the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "if neutrinos are an important fraction of the cosmological density , say @xmath2 , then the average neutrino mass must be considerably heavier than the splittings that are indicated by the observed atmospheric and solar oscillation frequencies .",
    "for example , for three light neutrinos , only models with almost degenerate neutrinos , with common mass @xmath3 ev , are compatible with a large hot dark matter component , but in this case the existing bounds on @xmath1 decay represent an important constraint . on the contrary hierarchical three neutrino models ( with both signs of @xmath4 ) have the largest neutrino mass fixed by @xmath5 ev . in view of all these important questions still pending",
    "it is no wonder that many different theoretical avenues are open and have been explored in the vast literature on the subject .    here",
    "we will briefly summarize the main categories of neutrino mass models , discuss their respective advantages and difficulties and give a number of examples .",
    "we illustrate how forthcoming experiments can discriminate among the various alternatives .",
    "we will devote a special attention to the most constrained set of models , those with only three widely split neutrinos , with masses dominated by the see - saw mechanism and inversely proportional to a large mass close to the grand unification scale @xmath6 . in this case",
    "one can aim at a comprehensive discussion in a gut framework of all fermion masses .",
    "this is to some extent possible in models based on su(5)@xmath7 u(1)@xmath8 or on so(10 ) ( we always consider susy gut s ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations imply neutrino masses which in turn demand either the existence of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos ( dirac masses ) or lepton number l violation ( majorana masses ) or both . given that neutrino masses are certainly extremely small , it is really difficult from the theory point of view to avoid the conclusion that l conservation must be violated .",
    "in fact , in terms of lepton number violation the smallness of neutrino masses can be explained as inversely proportional to the very large scale where l is violated , of order @xmath6 or even @xmath9 .",
    "once we accept l non - conservation we gain an elegant explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "if l is not conserved , even in the absence of heavy rh neutrinos , majorana masses can be generated for neutrinos by dimension five operators @xcite of the form    o_5=+  h.c .  , [ o5 ] with @xmath10 being the ordinary higgs doublet , @xmath11 the su(2 ) lepton doublets , @xmath12 a matrix in flavour space and @xmath13 a large scale of mass , of order @xmath6 or @xmath9 .",
    "neutrino masses generated by @xmath14 are of the order @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value of the ordinary higgs .",
    "we consider that the existence of rh neutrinos @xmath18 is quite plausible because all gut groups larger than su(5 ) require them .",
    "in particular the fact that @xmath18 completes the representation 16 of so(10 ) : 16=@xmath19 + 10 + 1 , so that all fermions of each family are contained in a single representation of the unifying group , is too impressive not to be significant .",
    "at least as a classification group so(10 ) must be of some relevance .",
    "thus in the following we assume that there are both @xmath18 and l non - conservation . with these assumptions",
    "the see - saw mechanism @xcite is possible . also to fix notations",
    "we recall that in its simplest form it arises as follows .",
    "consider the su(3 ) @xmath7 su(2 ) @xmath7 u(1 ) invariant lagrangian giving rise to dirac and @xmath18 majorana masses ( for the time being we consider the @xmath20 majorana mass terms as comparatively negligible ) : l=-^c^t y_(h l)+^t m ^c +  h.c .",
    "[ lag ] the dirac mass matrix @xmath21 , originating from electroweak symmetry breaking , is , in general , non - hermitian and non - symmetric , while the majorana mass matrix @xmath22 is symmetric , @xmath23 .",
    "we expect the eigenvalues of @xmath22 to be of order @xmath6 or more because @xmath18 majorana masses are su(3)@xmath7 su(2)@xmath7 u(1 ) invariant , hence unprotected and naturally of the order of the cutoff of the low - energy theory .",
    "since all @xmath18 are very heavy we can integrate them away .",
    "for this purpose we write down the equations of motion for @xmath18 in the static limit , @xmath24 neglecting their kinetic terms : -=y_(h l)- m ^c= 0  . [ eulag ] from this , by solving for @xmath18 , we obtain : ^c= m^-1 y_(h",
    "l )  . [ r ]",
    "we now replace in the lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) , this expression for @xmath18 and we get the operator @xmath14 of eq .",
    "( [ o5 ] ) with = -y_^t m^-1 y _  , and the resulting neutrino mass matrix reads : m_=m_d^t m^-1m_d  .",
    "this is the well known see - saw mechanism result @xcite : the light neutrino masses are quadratic in the dirac masses and inversely proportional to the large majorana mass .",
    "if some @xmath18 are massless or light they would not be integrated away but simply added to the light neutrinos .",
    "notice that the above results hold true for any number @xmath25 of heavy neutral fermions @xmath26 coupled to the 3 known neutrinos . in this more general case",
    "@xmath22 is an @xmath25 by @xmath25 symmetric matrix and the coupling between heavy and light fields is described by the rectangular @xmath25 by 3 matrix @xmath27 .",
    "note that for @xmath28 ev and @xmath29 with @xmath30 we find @xmath31 which indeed is an impressive indication for @xmath6 .",
    "if additional non - renormalisable contributions to @xmath14 , eq . [ o5 ] , are comparatively non - negligible , they should simply be added .",
    "after elimination of the heavy right - handed fields , at the level of the effective low - energy theory , the two types of terms are equivalent .",
    "in particular they have identical transformation properties under a chiral change of basis in flavour space .",
    "the difference is , however , that in the see - saw mechanism , the dirac matrix @xmath27 is presumably related to ordinary fermion masses because they are both generated by the higgs mechanism and both must obey gut - induced constraints .",
    "thus if we assume the see - saw mechanism more constraints are implied .",
    "in the universe we observe an apparent excess of baryons over antibaryons .",
    "it is appealing that one can explain the observed baryon asymmetry by dynamical evolution starting from an initial state of the universe with zero baryon number ( baryogenesis ) .",
    "for baryogenesis one needs the three famous sakharov conditions : b violation , cp violation and no thermal equilibrium . in the history of the universe these necessary requirements can have occurred at different epochs .",
    "note however that the asymmetry generated by one epoch could be erased at following epochs if not protected by some dynamical reason . in principle",
    "these conditions could be verified in the sm at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "b is violated by instantons when kt is of the order of the weak scale ( but b - l is conserved ) , cp is violated by the ckm phase and sufficiently marked out - of- equilibrium conditions could be realized during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "so the conditions for baryogenesis at the weak scale in the sm superficially appear to be present .",
    "however , a more quantitative analysis @xcite , shows that baryogenesis is not possible in the sm because there is not enough cp violation and the phase transition is not sufficiently strong first order , unless @xmath32 , which is by now completely excluded by lep . in susy extensions of the sm ,",
    "in particular in the mssm , there are additional sources of cp violations and the bound on @xmath33 is modified by a sufficient amount by the presence of scalars with large couplings to the higgs sector , typically the s - top .",
    "what is required is that @xmath34 , a s - top not heavier than the top quark and , preferentially , a small @xmath35 .",
    "this possibility has by now become very marginal with the results of the lep2 running .",
    "if baryogenesis at the weak scale is excluded by the data it can occur at or just below the gut scale , after inflation .",
    "but only that part with @xmath36 would survive and not be erased at the weak scale by instanton effects .",
    "thus baryogenesis at @xmath37 needs b - l violation at some stage like for @xmath38 if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the two effects could be related if baryogenesis arises from leptogenesis then converted into baryogenesis by instantons @xcite .",
    "recent results on neutrino masses are compatible with this elegant possibility @xcite .",
    "thus the case of baryogenesis through leptogenesis has been boosted by the recent results on neutrinos @xcite .    in leptogenesis the departure from equilibrium",
    "is determined by the deviation from the average number density induced by the decay of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "the yukawa interactions of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath18 lead to the decays @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 a lepton ) and @xmath41 with cp violation .",
    "the violation of l conservation arises from the @xmath42 terms that produce the majorana mass terms .",
    "the rates of the various interaction processes involved are temperature dependent with different powers of @xmath43 , so that the equilibrium densities and the temperatures of decoupling from equilibrium during the universe expansion are different for different particles and interactions .",
    "the rates @xmath44 of @xmath42 processes depend also on the neutrino masses and mixings , so that the observed values of the baryon asymmetry are related to neutrino processes . precisely , @xmath45 where @xmath13 is the large scale that appears in eq .",
    "( [ o5 ] ) and also in the expression of light neutrino masses @xmath46 .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium condition @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the expansion rate of the universe , leads to @xmath49 which then implies the relation ( when correct proportionality factors and sum over flavours are included ) : _ i m__i^2 ^ 2 [ limit ] what exactly is the temperature @xmath43 which is relevant for leptogenesis depends on the thermal history of the early universe and goes beyond the realm of neutrino physics .",
    "but if @xmath49 and @xmath50 then the upper limit is significant and compatible with present neutrino data .",
    "if the rh neutrinos are thermally produced , then the mass of the rh neutrino that drives l violation is limited by the reheat temperature after inflation , which in turn is typically required not to exceed @xmath51 gev .",
    "this limit can be evaded if the rh neutrinos are instead produced by large inflaton oscillations during the preheating stage @xcite .",
    "the lsnd signal @xcite has not been confirmed by karmen @xcite .",
    "it will be soon double - checked by miniboone @xcite .",
    "perhaps it will fade away .",
    "but if an oscillation with @xmath52 is confirmed then , in presence of three distinct frequencies for lsnd , atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino oscillations , the simplest possibility is to introduce at least four light neutrinos .",
    "since lep has limited to three the number of `` active '' neutrinos ( that is with weak interactions , or equivalently with non - vanishing weak isospin , the only possible gauge charge of neutrinos ) the additional light neutrino(s ) @xmath53 must be `` sterile '' , i.e. with vanishing weak isospin .",
    "note that @xmath18 that appears in the see - saw mechanism , if it exists , is indeed a sterile neutrino , but a heavy one .",
    "a possibility to accommodate atmospheric , solar and lsnd evidences for neutrino oscillations without introducing one or more sterile neutrinos is to invoke cpt violation @xcite .",
    "the required independent frequencies are provided by different neutrino and anti - neutrino masses and the fit to the present data has a good quality @xcite .",
    "a typical pattern of masses that works for 4-@xmath20 models consists of two pairs of neutrinos @xcite with mass separation between the two pairs , of order @xmath54 , corresponding to the lsnd frequency .",
    "the upper doublet is almost degenerate at @xmath55 of order @xmath56 being only split by ( the mass squared difference corresponding to ) the atmospheric ( solar ) @xmath20 frequency , while the lower doublet is split by the solar ( atmospheric ) @xmath20 frequency .",
    "an alternative to this 2 - 2 spectrum is given by a 3 - 1 pattern with 1 being a nearly pure sterile neutrino separated by the lsnd frequency from the 3 .",
    "the 3 - 1 spectrum leads to a comparable ( poor ) overall quality of fit as the 2 - 2 pattern .",
    "these mass configurations can be compatible with an important fraction of hot dark matter in the universe .",
    "a complication is that the data appear to be incompatible with pure 2-@xmath20 oscillations for @xmath57 oscillations for solar neutrinos @xcite and for @xmath58 oscillations for atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "there are however ( after sno , marginally ) viable alternatives .",
    "one possibility is obtained by using the large freedom allowed by the presence of 6 mixing angles in the most general 4-@xmath20 mixing matrix .",
    "if at least 4 angles are significantly different from zero , one can go beyond pure 2-@xmath20 oscillations and , for example , for solar neutrino oscillations @xmath59 can transform into a mixture of @xmath60 and @xmath53 , where @xmath60 is an active neutrino , itself a superposition of @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( mainly @xmath62 ) @xcite .",
    "a different alternative is to have many interfering sterile neutrinos : this is the case in the interesting class of models with large extra dimensions , where a whole tower of kaluza - klein neutrinos is introduced .",
    "this picture of sterile neutrinos from extra dimensions appears exciting and we now discuss it in some detail @xcite .    the context is theories with large extra dimensions .",
    "gravity propagates in all @xmath63 dimensions ( bulk ) , while sm particles live on a 4d brane .",
    "as well known @xcite , this can make the fundamental scale of gravity @xmath64 much smaller than the planck mass @xmath9 .",
    "in fact for @xmath65 we have a geometrical factor @xmath66 , the volume of the compact dimensions , that suppresses gravity , so that ( m_d)^  v _  =  ( m_pl / m_d)^2  , [ exd1 ] and , as a result , @xmath64 can be as small as @xmath67 . for neutrino phenomenology",
    "we need a really large extra dimension , with a radius @xmath26 at least of the order of the scale set by the observed solar oscillation frequencies , @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "if we insist on having @xmath64 around @xmath70 we can assume , for instance , one compact dimension with radius @xmath26 and @xmath71 dimensions with a common radius @xmath72 , such that the volume @xmath73 fits eq .",
    "( [ exd1 ] ) . in string theories of gravity",
    "there are always scalar fields associated with gravity together with their susy fermionic partners ( dilatini , modulini ) @xcite .",
    "these are particles that propagate in the bulk , have no gauge interactions and can well play the role of sterile neutrinos .",
    "the models based on this framework @xcite have some good features that make them very appealing at first sight .",
    "they provide a `` physical '' picture for @xmath53 . in the simplest case",
    "the theory includes a 5d fermion @xmath74 , which decomposes into two 4d weyl spinors @xmath75 and @xmath76 and contains a kk tower of recurrences of sterile neutrinos : _",
    "s(x , y )  =  _ n  _",
    "s^(n)(x ) e^i  .",
    "[ 4nu1 ] the tower mixes with the ordinary light active neutrinos in the lepton doublet @xmath40 : s_mix = d^4 x _ s(x,0 ) h(x ) l(x )  .",
    "[ 4nu2 ] the interaction is restricted to the 4d brane at @xmath77 where sm fields live .",
    "since the 5d spinor @xmath75 has mass dimension 2 , we need the mass parameter @xmath78 to keep the yukawa coupling constant dimensionless . from eqs .",
    "( [ exd1],[4nu1],[4nu2 ] ) , after electroweak symmetry breaking , we find : s_mix = d^4 x _ n _ s^(n)(x ) _",
    "a(x )  , [ 4nu3 ] where @xmath79 and @xmath60 is the active neutrino embedded in @xmath40 .",
    "note that the geometrical factor @xmath80 , which automatically suppresses the yukawa coupling @xmath81 , arises naturally from the fact that the sterile neutrino tower lives in the bulk .",
    "an additional mass parameter @xmath82 , related to a possible bulk mass term for the 5d fermion @xmath74 is also allowed ( in more realistic realizations , more 5d fields and l - violating interactions can be present ) .    the pattern of oscillations results from the superposition of infinite components with increasing frequencies @xmath83 and decreasing amplitudes @xmath84 .",
    "the leading oscillation frequency , @xmath85 , and the dominant mixing angle are determined by @xmath82 and @xmath86 , whereas the number of kk excitations that effectively take part in the oscillation is controlled by @xmath87 . indeed , if @xmath88 , the kk modes , whose masses are approximately given by @xmath89 , decouple , with the possible exception of the lightest mode .",
    "if on the contrary @xmath90 , then several kk levels participate to the oscillation and the resulting energy dependence of the survival / conversion probability can appreciably differ from that of the two level case .",
    "indeed the contribution of a few kk states makes the solar oscillation spectrum more compatible with the data .",
    "note in passing that @xmath53 mixings must be small due to existing limits from weak processes , supernovae and nucleosynthesis @xcite , so that the preferred solution for this kk @xmath20 model is msw sa .",
    "instead the kk states should decouple in the case of atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "these constraints fix the range of admissible values of r as specified above .    in spite of its good properties",
    "there are problems with this picture , in our opinion .",
    "the first property that we do not like of models with large extra dimensions is that the connection with gut s is lost .",
    "in particular the elegant explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses in terms of the large scale where the l conservation is violated in general evaporates . since @xmath91 is small , what forbids on the brane an operator of the form @xmath92 which would lead to by far too large @xmath20 masses ?",
    "one must impose by hand l conservation on the brane and that it is only broken by some majorana masses of sterile @xmath20 s in the bulk , which we find somewhat ad hoc .",
    "another problem is that we would expect gravity to know nothing about flavour , but here we would need rh partners for @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "also a single large extra dimension has problems , because it implies @xcite a linear evolution of the gauge couplings with energy from @xmath93 to @xmath91 . but",
    "for more large extra dimensions the kk recurrences do not decouple fast enough .",
    "perhaps a compromise at d=2 is possible . in conclusion",
    "the models with large extra dimension are interesting because they are speculative and fascinating but the more conventional framework still appears more plausible at closer inspection .",
    "we now assume that the lsnd signal will not be confirmed , so that there are only two distinct neutrino oscillation frequencies , the atmospheric and the solar frequencies .",
    "these two can be reproduced with the known three light neutrino species ( for other reviews of three neutrino models see @xcite ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations are due to a misalignment between the flavour basis , @xmath94 , where @xmath59 is the partner of the mass and flavour eigenstate @xmath95 in a left - handed ( lh ) weak isospin su(2 ) doublet ( similarly for @xmath61 and @xmath96 ) and the mass eigenstates @xmath97 @xcite :  = u  , [ u ] where @xmath98 is the unitary 3 by 3 mixing matrix . given the definition of @xmath98 and the transformation properties of the effective light neutrino mass matrix @xmath99 : [ tr ] ^t m _ &= & ^t u^t m_u + u^t m _ u & = & diag(m_1,m_2,m_3)m_diag  , we obtain the general form of @xmath99 ( i.e. of the light @xmath20 mass matrix in the basis where the charged lepton mass is a diagonal matrix ) : m_=u m_diag u^t  .",
    "[ gen ] the matrix @xmath98 can be parameterized in terms of three mixing angles @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and one phase @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) @xcite , exactly as for the quark mixing matrix @xmath106 .",
    "the following definition of mixing angles can be adopted : u  =   ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ufi ] where @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",

    "many effects can perturb this limit , such as small symmetry breaking terms , radiative corrections , effects coming from residual rotations needed to diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix , or to render canonical the leptonic kinetic terms .",
    "some of these will be discussed more in detail in the next sections .",
    "it turns out that in most of the existing models the leading textures are modified by small perturbations having a simple structure , such as those called d1 , d2 ,",
    "i and n in eqs .",
    "( [ deg4 ] ) , ( [ deg2 ] ) , ( [ invh1 ] ) and ( [ hier1 ] ) .    we have analyzed these perturbations , with the hope that the results are sufficiently representative of the many existing models . of course there is no guarantee that this discussion can cover all theoretical possibilities",
    ". moreover , if @xmath117 and @xmath102 were as large as experimentally allowed , the perturbations would become large , the whole approach could become questionable and the data would be more appropriately described by an anarchical framework .",
    "a remarkable feature is that most models continue to predict an almost maximal solar angle , even after inclusion of the perturbations .",
    "this is often due to an approximate pseudo - dirac structure in the 12 sector , which , at leading order , forces @xmath118 .",
    "exceptions to this trend are given by some of the possibilities offered by the normal hierarchy , for which @xmath100 is undetermined at leading order .",
    "it is also apparent that , apart from the case of degenerate spectrum realized with a texture similar to the one of flavor democracy ( d2 ) , the possibility of measuring @xmath119 with the next generation of experiments seems to be significant only if the solar oscillation frequency is very close to the upper part of the range allowed by the msw la solution .",
    "the discovery of @xmath120 decay would be very important because it would establish lepton number violation and the majorana nature of @xmath20 s .",
    "indeed oscillation experiments can not distinguish between pure dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "moreover , the search for @xmath121 decay provides information about the absolute spectrum , while neutrino oscillations are only sensitive to mass differences .",
    "complementary information on the sum of neutrino masses is also provided by the galaxy power spectrum combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite . as already mentioned",
    "the present limit from @xmath120 is @xmath122 ev or to be more conservative @xmath123 ev @xcite . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to see what is the level at which a signal can be expected or at least not excluded in the different classes of models @xcite . for 3-neutrino models with degenerate , inverse hierarchy or normal hierarchy mass patterns , starting from the general formula in eq .",
