    "we have previously pointed out ( stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ( hereafter , sds92 ) ) that very high energy @xmath0-ray  beams from blazars can be used to measure the intergalactic infrared radiation field , since pair - production interactions of @xmath0-rays  with intergalactic ir photons will attenuate the high - energy ends of blazar spectra . determining the intergalactic ir field , in turn ,",

    "as energy thresholds are lowered in both existing and planned ground - based air cherenkov light detectors ( cresti 1996 ) , cutoffs in the @xmath0-ray  spectra of more distant blazars are expected , owing to extinction by the iirf .",
    "these can be used to explore the redshift dependence of the iirf ( stecker & salamon 1997 ; salamon & stecker 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , by using blazars for a determination of attenuation as a function of redshift , combined with a direct observation of the ir background from the _ dirbe _ detector on _ cobe _ , one can , in principle , measure of the hubble constant @xmath3 at truly cosmological distances ( salamon , stecker & de jager 1994 ) .",

    "of all of the blazars detected by _ egret _ , only the low - redshift bl lac , mrk 421 , has been seen by the whipple telescope .",

    "egret_.    in this paper , we calculate the absorption coefficient of intergalactic space using a new , empirically based calculation of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of intergalactic low energy photons ( malkan & stecker 1998 ; hereafter ms98 ) obtained by integrating luminosity dependent infrared spectra of galaxies over their luminosity and redshift distributions . after giving our results on the @xmath0-ray  optical depth as a function of energy and",
    "redshift out to a redshift of 0.3 , we apply our calculations by comparing our results with recent spectral data on mrk 421 as reported by mcenery , _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) and spectral data on mrk 501 given by aharonian , _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the results presented here supercede those of our previous calculations ( stecker & de jager 1997 ) , which were based more on theoretical models ( see discussion in ms98 ) .",
    "we consider the results presented here to be considerably more reliable than any presented previously .",
    "the formulae relevant to absorption calculations involving pair - production are given and discussed in sds92 . for @xmath0-rays in the tev energy range , the pair - production cross section is maximized when the soft photon energy is in the infrared range : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the compton wavelength of the electron . for a 1 tev @xmath0-ray",
    ", this corresponds to a soft photon having a wavelength near the k - band ( 2.2@xmath7 m ) .",
    "( pair - production interactions actually take place with photons over a range of wavelengths around the optimal value as determined by the energy dependence of the cross section . )",
    "if the emission spectrum of an extragalactic source extends beyond 20 tev , then the extragalactic infrared field should cut off the _ observed _ spectrum between @xmath8 gev and @xmath2 tev , depending on the redshift of the source ( stecker & salamon 1997 ; salamon & stecker 1998 , and this paper ) .    in our calculations",
    ", we make the reasonable simplifying assumption that the iirf is basically in place at redshifts @xmath9 0.3 , having been produced primarily at higher redshifts ( madau 1996 ; stecker & salamon 1997 ; salamon & stecker 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore limited our calculations to @xmath10 . for a treatment of intergalactic absorption at higher redshifts by optical and uv photons using recent data on galaxy evolution at moderate and high redshifts ,",
    "see stecker & salamon ( 1997 ) and salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) .",
    "we assume for the iirf , two of the seds given in ms98 ( shown in figure 1 ) ; the lower curve in figure 1 assumes evolution out to @xmath11 , whereas the upper curve assumes evolution out to @xmath12 .",
    "evolution in stellar emissivity is expected to level off or decrease at redshifts greater than @xmath13 ( fall , charlot & pei 1996 , madau 1996 ) , so that the two curves in fig .",
    "1 may be considered to be lower and upper limits , bounding the expected ir flux ( ms98 ) .",
    "using these two seds for the iirf , we have obtained parametric expressions for @xmath14 for @xmath10 , taking a hubble constant of @xmath15 km s@xmath16mpc@xmath16 ( gratton , _ et al . _",
    "the double - peaked form of the sed of the iirf requires a 3rd order polynomial to reproduce parametrically .",

    "the numbers before the brackets are obtained using the lower iirf sed shown in figure 1 ; the numbers in the brackets are obtained using the higher iirf sed . because we are using real iras data to give more accurate estimates of the iirf , we do not give values of @xmath22 for e @xmath9 1 tev and for larger redshifts , which would involve interactions with starlight photons of wavelengths @xmath23 m . equation",

    "this result implies that the _ intrinsic _ spectra of the sources should be harder by @xmath34 0.25 in the lower irrf case , and @xmath1 0.45 in the higher iirf case .",
    "we have calculated the absorption coefficient of intergalactic space from pair - production interactions with low energy photons of the iirf , both as a function of energy and redshift , using new , more reliable estimates of the sed for the iirf which were obtained by ms98 .",
    "our results predict less absorption than we obtained previously ( stecker & de jager 1997 ) , because the ms98 iirf is lower than our previous estimate .",
    "one reason for this difference is that our previous iirf spectrum was normalized partly to reflect the estimate of gregorich , _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) of the iirf at 60 @xmath7 m .",
    "according to bertin , dennefeld & moshir ( 1997 ) , that estimate may have been based on the inclusion of false detections in their analysis of the iras data . for absorption calculations ,",
    "it is important to use the most reliable estimate of the iirf avaliable , since the absorption effect depends exponentially on the magnitude of the iirf . while we do not claim that our new results for the absorption coeeficient as a function of energy differ dramatically from those obtained previously ( macminn & primack 1996 ; stecker & de jager 1997 )",
    ", we _ do _ claim that they are more reliable because they are based on the empirically derived iirf given by ms98 , whereas all previous calculations of tev @xmath0-ray absorption were based on theoretical modeling of the iirf .",
    "the ms98 calculation was based on data from nearly 3000 iras galaxies .",
    "these data included ( 1 ) the luminosity dependent infrared seds of galaxies , ( 2 ) the 60@xmath7 m luminosity function of galaxies and , ( 3 ) the redshift distribution of galaxies .",
    "we have applied our absorption calculations to recent flaring spectra of the nearby bl lac objects mrk 421 and mrk 501 .",
    "the spectral calculations given here are in good agreement with the recent observations that indicate no significant curvature in the spectra of mrk 421 and mrk 501 .",
    "the observations are also consistent with our calculated steepening of 0.25 to 0.45 in the spectral index of these sources in the 1 - 10 tev range .",
    "our new calculations predict a significant intergalactic absorption effect which should cut off the spectra of mrk 421 and mrk 501 at energies greater than @xmath120 tev .",
    "observations of these objects at large zenith angles , which give large effective threshold energies , may thus demonstrate the effect of intergalactic absorption .",
    "our new calculations confirm the conclusion in sds92 that tev spectra of sources at redshifts higher than 0.1 should suffer significant absorption .",

    "_ , 1es2344 + 514 ( catanese , _ et al . _",
