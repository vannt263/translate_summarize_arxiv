    "an important prediction of quantum theory is the existence of irreducible fluctuations of electromagnetic fields in vacuum . besides their numerous observable consequences in microscopic physics",
    ", vacuum fluctuations also have observable effects in macroscopic physics , for example the casimir force they exert on mirrors @xcite .",
    "casimir calculated this force in a geometrical configuration where two plane mirrors are placed a distance @xmath0 apart and parallel to each other , the area @xmath1 of the mirrors being much larger than the squared distance @xmath2 .",
    "he considered the ideal case of perfectly reflecting mirrors and obtained an expression which , remarkably , depends only on the geometrical quantities @xmath1 and @xmath0 and on the fundamental constants @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5    this attractive force has been observed in a number of ` historical ' experiments @xcite which confirmed its existence and main properties @xcite .",
    "several recent experiments reached an accuracy in the % range by measuring the force between a plane and a sphere @xcite or two cylinders @xcite .",
    "similar experiments were also performed with mems @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an experiment studied the plane - plane configuration considered by casimir @xcite but , as a consequence of the difficulties associated with this geometry , reached only a 15% accuracy ( see reviews of recent experiments in @xcite ) .",
    "the casimir force is the most accessible experimental consequence of vacuum fluctuations in the macroscopic world while vacuum energy is known to raise a serious problem with respect to gravity and cosmology ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "this is a reason for testing the predictions of quantum field theory concerning the casimir effect with the greatest care and accuracy .",
    "the theory of the casimir force is also a key point for the experiments searching for the new weak forces predicted by theoretical unification models to arise at distances between nanometer and millimeter @xcite .",
    "the casimir force is indeed the dominant effect between two neutral objects at @xmath6 m or sub@xmath6 m distances so that an accurate knowledge of its theoretical expectation is as crucial as the precision of measurements in such experiments @xcite .    in this context",
    ", it is essential to account for the differences between the ideal case considered by casimir and the real experimental situation .",
    "recent experiments use metallic mirrors which show perfect reflection only at frequencies below their plasma frequency .",
    "they are performed at room temperature , with the effect of thermal fluctuations superimposed to that of vacuum fluctuations . in the most accurate experiments",
    ", the force is measured between a plane and a sphere , and not between two parallel planes .",
    "the surface state of the plates , in particular their roughness , should also affect the force .",
    "a large number of works have been devoted to the study of these effects and we refer the reader to @xcite for a bibliography .    the evaluation of the casimir force between imperfect lossy mirrors at non zero temperature has given rise to a burst of controversial results @xcite which constitutes a part of the motivations for the present work .",
    "for the sake of comparing experimental measurements and theoretical expectations , it is necessary to have at one s disposal a reliable expression of the casimir force in the experimental situation . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our attention on the effect of imperfect reflection of the mirrors .",
    "other effects , in particular the effect of temperature , will be addressed in follow - on papers .",
    "we consider the original casimir geometry with two perfectly plane and parallel mirrors . except for these assumptions",
    ", we consider arbitrary frequency dependences for the mirrors which , in particular , may be lossy .",
    "we evaluate the casimir force as the effect of vacuum radiation pressure on the fabry - perot cavity formed by the two mirrors .",
    "the net force results from the balance between the repulsive and attractive contributions associated respectively with resonant or antiresonant frequencies . it is obtained as an integral over the axis of real frequencies , including the contribution of evanescent waves besides that of ordinary waves .",
    "it is then transformed into an integral over imaginary frequencies by using physical properties fulfilled by all real mirrors .",
    "the formula obtained here for the casimir force turns out to be identical to the expression already published in @xcite but the new derivation has a wider scope of validity than the previous one since it remains valid for lossy mirrors .",
    "the fact that the formula keeps the same form despite the widening of the assumptions is intimately related to a theorem which relates the spectral density of the fields inside the cavity to the reflection amplitudes seen by the same fields .",
    "this theorem was demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite in specific cases and we prove it in the present paper without any restriction . to this aim , we introduce a systematic treatment of lossy mirrors and cavities as dissipative networks @xcite .",
    "we define scattering and transfer matrices for elementary networks like the interface between two media or the propagation over a given length in a medium .",
    "we then deduce the matrices associated with composed networks , like the optical slab or the multilayer mirror .",
    "the results obtained in this manner are therefore applicable to a large variety of mirrors , still with the assumption of perfect plane geometry . in the particular case of a slab with a large width",
    ", the lifshitz expression @xcite is recovered . at the limit of perfectly reflectors , the ideal casimir formula ( [ eqcasimir ] )",
    "is obtained .",
    "more generally , the expression gives the casimir force as an integral written in terms of the reflection amplitudes characterizing the two mirrors .",
    "this integral is finite as soon as the amplitudes obey the general properties of scattering theory already alluded to . in other words ,",
    "the difficulties usually associated with the infiniteness of vacuum energy are solved by using the properties of real mirrors themselves rather than through an additional formal regularization technique .",
    "we finally show that the same physical properties constrain the variation of the casimir force .",
    "in particular , they invalidate proposals which has been done for ` tayloring ' the force at will by using mirrors with specially designed scattering amplitudes @xcite . in these proposals ,",
    "the balance between attractive and repulsive contributions to the force is change , leading to the hope that the casimir force could reach large or have its sign changed from an attractive force to a repulsive one @xcite . using the simple model of a one - dimensional space , it has already been shown @xcite that these hopes can not be met for arbitrary mirrors built up with dielectric layers . here ,",
    "the argument is generalized to the casimir geometry in three - dimensional space with the following conclusions  : the casimir force can not exceed the value obtained for perfect mirrors , it remains attractive for any cavity length and its value is a decreasing function of the cavity length .",
    "this is true for any mirror obtained by piling up layers of media described by dielectric functions .",
    "this definition of multilayer dielectric mirrors includes the case of metallic layers , provided that magnetic effects play a negligible role in the optical response .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we consider in this paper the original casimir geometry with perfectly plane and parallel mirrors aligned along the directions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this configuration obeys a symmetry with respect to time translation as well as transverse space translations along these directions .",
    "we use bold letters for two - dimensional vectors along these directions and denote @xmath9 the transverse position . as a consequence of this symmetry , the frequency @xmath10 , the transverse vector @xmath11 and the polarization @xmath12 are preserved throughout the scattering processes on a mirror or a cavity . the scattering couples only the free vacuum modes which have the same values for the preserved quantum numbers and differ by the sign of the longitudinal component @xmath13 of the wavevector .",
    "in the present section , we introduce notations for the vacuum field modes , first in empty space and then in a dielectric medium .",
    "these notations are chosen to be well - adapted to the symmetry of the problem .      in empty space ,",
    "the components of the wavevector are given for each field mode by the frequency @xmath14 , the incidence angle @xmath15 and the azimuthal angle @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 is the modulus of the transverse wavevector and the longitudinal component @xmath13 may be expressed in terms of the preserved quantities @xmath14 and @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 is defined as the sign of @xmath22 and represents the direction of propagation with @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding respectively to rightward and leftward propagation .",
    "the two polarizations @xmath12 are defined by the transversality with the incidence plane of electric and magnetic fields respectively .",
    "they are given by the unit electric vectors @xmath25 @xmath26 or , equivalently , the unit magnetic vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for each mode ,",
    "the wavevector and polarization vectors form an orthogonal spatial basis .",
    "we have chosen linear polarizations described by real components ; hence the unit vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not affected by the complex conjugation appearing below in the relation between positive and negative frequencies .",
    "the two modes corresponding to the same values of @xmath14 , @xmath19 and @xmath31 but opposite values of @xmath21 are coupled by scattering on a mirror .",
    "for this reason , we introduce a label @xmath32 gathering the values of @xmath10 , @xmath19 and @xmath31 .",
    "a mode freely propagating in vacuum is thus labeled by @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the summation over modes is described by the symbols @xmath35 note that @xmath34 appears implicitly as the sign of @xmath13 in the first form whereas it appears explicitly in the second one .",
    "the free vacuum fields are then written as linear superpositions of modes @xmath36 the vacuum impedance @xmath37 describes the electromagnetic constants in vacuum . in the following ,",

    "this simple model is not sufficient for an accurate evaluation of the casimir force between real mirrors @xcite . to this aim , it is necessary to describe the optical response of metals with a dissipative part associated with electronic relaxation processes . as a consequence of causality ,",

    "we now introduce the description of mirrors as optical networks .",
    "we present the scattering and transfer representations and the relations between them . the transfer approach is well adapted to the composition of networks which are piled up .",

    "we only consider classical fields or , equivalently , mean quantum fields .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the full quantum treatment including the addition of noise associated with the losses inside the mirror .",
    "we first introduce the scattering and transfer representations for an arbitrary network represented with two ports and four fields .",
    "these fields are identified as lefthand / righthand ( symbols ` l ' and ` r ' ) , rightward / leftward ( arrows @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) or input / output fields ( labels ` in ' and ` out ' ) , as shown on figure [ fignetwork ] .",
    "let us emphasize that the arrows are a symbolic representation of the two modes coupled by the network which correspond to the same label @xmath33 and to the two opposite signs @xmath74 .",

    ", the network is described by lefthand and righthand columns related by a @xmath82matrix @xmath83    the matrix @xmath84 introduced in ( [ smatrixtilde ] ) exchanges the two directions of propagation .",
    "we also use in the following the matrices @xmath85 which project onto each direction @xmath86 these matrices obey simple rules which define an algebraic calculus in the space @xmath87 of @xmath88 matrices with complex coefficients @xmath89    the identification of figure ( [ fignetwork ] ) is written as @xmath90 it relates the transfer and scattering amplitudes .",
    "we decompose the scattering equations ( [ smatrix ] ) on the two components and use ( [ identify ] ) to rewrite them as @xmath91 this linear system may be put under a matrix form @xmath92 it is equivalent to the transfer equation ( [ tmatrix ] ) with the @xmath82matrix obtained as @xmath93    the converse transformation is obtained by performing the same manipulations in the reverse order . starting from the transfer equation ( [ tmatrix ] ) and using ( [ identify ] ) , one obtains a linear system which is equivalent to the scattering equation ( [ smatrixtilde ] ) with @xmath94 the relations ( [ stot ] ) and ( [ ttos ] ) have the same form .",
    "they represent an idempotent homographic transformation in the space @xmath95 , care being taken for the non - commutativity of multiplications in this space . when inverting algebraically the homographic relations ( [ stot ] ) and ( [ ttos ] ) , one obtains equivalent expressions @xmath96 other equivalent expressions are obtained from the equalities @xmath97    all these expressions",
    "may be written in terms of the scattering and transfer amplitudes @xmath98 the more formal homographic transformations written above are nevertheless useful , as it will become clear in forthcoming calculations .",
    "the @xmath82matrices are perfectly adapted to the composition of optical networks corresponding to a piling up process ( see figure [ figcomposition ] ) .    on each network ,",
    "the transfer equations are written as @xmath99 the brackets @xmath100 specify the network for which the @xmath82matrix or field column is written . identifying the fields according to figure ( [ figcomposition ] )",
    "@xmath101 we deduce that the piling up process is equivalent to the product of @xmath102-matrices",
    "@xmath103 we have assumed the two networks to be in the immediate vicinity of each other but without any electronic exchange between them , which again corresponds to the assumption of thick enough layers .",
    "we now study two elementary networks , that is the traversal of an interface and the propagation over a given length inside a dielectric medium .",
    "for the scattering at the plane interface between two media with indices @xmath104 and @xmath105 , we write the reflection and transmission amplitudes as the fresnel scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "reflection amplitudes @xmath106 are obtained from characteristic impedances @xmath107 defined for plane waves with polarization @xmath31 in each medium and from the continuity equations at the interface @xmath108 then the transmission amplitudes are obtained as @xmath109 we deduce the expression of the transfer matrix @xmath110    we now consider the process of field propagation over a propagation length @xmath111 inside a dielectric medium characterized by a permittivity @xmath112 . for this elementary network , the @xmath82matrix has the simple form @xmath113 the optical depth @xmath114 does not depend on the polarization .",
    "note that the composition is commutative within the class of interfaces or that of propagations  : it corresponds to the multiplication of the @xmath115parameters for interfaces and to the addition of @xmath116parameters for propagations .",
    "but the composition is no longer commutative when interfaces and propagations are piled up .",
    "we now prove a reciprocity theorem obeyed by arbitrary dielectric multilayers , _",
    "i.e. _ networks obtained by piling up interfaces and propagations .",
    "to this aim , we first remark that the ratio of the two transmission amplitudes is related to the determinant of the @xmath82matrix @xmath117 this follows from the relations ( [ sandtamplitudes ] ) between @xmath75 and @xmath82amplitudes for an arbitrary network .",
    "then , it is clear from ( [ compot ] ) that the determinant of @xmath102 is simply multiplied under composition @xmath118 for the two kinds of elementary networks studied previously ( see eqs [ tint]-[tprop ] ) , the determinant of @xmath102 is the ratio of the values of @xmath69 at the right and left sides of the network @xmath119 it follows that this relation is valid for any optical network composed by piling up interfaces and propagations .",
    "in the particular case where the network has its two ports corresponding to vacuum , which is the case for a mirror , the values of @xmath69 are equal on its two sides and the @xmath82matrix has a unit determinant @xmath120 note that reciprocity corresponds to a symmetrical @xmath75matrix and has to be distinguished from the spatial symmetry of the network with respect to its mediane plane which entails @xmath121 .",
    "this theorem is the specific form , when the symmetry of plane mirrors is assumed , of the general reciprocity theorem demonstrated by casimir @xcite as an extension to electromagnetism of onsager s microreversibility theorem @xcite .",
    "we have disregarded any static magnetic field which could affect these reciprocity relations .",
    "we now consider the dielectric slabs and multilayers as composed networks and we deduce their transfer and scattering amplitudes from the preceding results .    the slab is obtained by piling up a vacuum / matter interface with indices @xmath122 and @xmath123 at its left and righthand sides , propagation over a length @xmath124 inside matter , and a matter / vacuum interface with now @xmath123 and @xmath122 at its left and righthand sides .",
    "we denote @xmath125 the @xmath82matrix associated with the first interface and obtain the @xmath82matrix associated with the second interface as the inverse of @xmath125 . as a consequence of the composition law ( [ compot ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath82matrix associated with the slab is obtained as @xmath126    using the expressions ( [ tint],[tprop ] ) of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we evaluate @xmath129 as @xmath130 we deduce the form of the @xmath75matrix which is simultaneously reciprocal ( @xmath131 ) and symmetrical in the exchange of its two ports ( @xmath121 ) @xmath132 in the limiting case of a small thickness @xmath133 , we find @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which means that the slab tends to become transparent . in this case",
    "indeed , the propagation can be forgotten and the two inverse interfaces have their effects cancelled by each other .    the opposite limiting case of a large thickness is often considered since it fits the usual experimental situations . more precisely ,",
    "experiments are performed with metallic mirrors having a thickness much larger than the plasma wavelength .",
    "this is why the limit of a total extinction of the field through the medium is assumed in most calculations .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called ` bulk limit ' with @xmath136 and @xmath137 in eq.([slab ] )  : the reflection amplitude is determined entirely by the first interface .",
    "let us emphasize however that the bulk limit raises several delicate problems .",
    "first , the transmission amplitude @xmath138 vanishes in this limit so that the @xmath82matrix is not defined , with the drawback of invalidating the general method used in the present paper .",
    "then , the bulk limit can not be met in the case of non absorbing media where @xmath139 remains a complex number with unit modulus for any value of @xmath124 . even in the presence of absorption ,",
    "a large value of the width @xmath124 does not necessarily imply a large value of the optical thickness @xmath114 since @xmath69 may go to zero at normal incidence and zero frequency , leading to a transparent slab in contrast with the results of the bulk limit .",
    "therefore a reliable calculation must consider the experimental situation of mirrors with a large but finite thickness .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the general case of arbitrary mirrors and test the reliability of the bulk limit in the end of the calculations .",
    "we can deal with the case of dielectric multilayers similarly .",
    "if we consider as an example the multilayer obtained by piling up a vacuum / matter interface with indices @xmath122 and @xmath123 at its left and righthand sides , propagation over a length @xmath140 inside the medium 1 , an interface between media 1 and 2 , propagation over a length @xmath141 inside the medium 2 , and an interface between medium 2 and vacuum , its @xmath82matrix is obtained as the product @xmath142 alternatively , the same multilayer may be obtained by piling up two slabs each corresponding to one of the layers @xmath143 in the last two equations , the indices specify the different interfaces , propagations or slabs using an obvious convention .",
    "since any multilayer mirror is obtained by piling up slabs connecting two vacuum ports and thus obeying the reciprocity relation @xmath131 , we can use a simple form of the composition law written in terms of scattering amplitudes @xcite @xmath144 for readibility , we have specified the networks by using subscripts rather than brackets .",
    "we will proceed similarly in forthcoming specific computations .",
    "iterating this composition law , we can compute the scattering amplitudes for any dielectric multilayer .",
    "this systematic technique is quite similar to the classical computation techniques used for studying multilayers @xcite .",
    "it is generalized to the full quantum treatment in the next section .",
    "it also leads in the following to general results constraining the variation of the casimir force for arbitrary dielectric mirrors .",
    "it reproduces the known results for the multilayer systems which have already been studied @xcite .",
    "up to now , we have performed a classical analysis which is not sufficient for the purpose of describing the scattering of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "real mirrors consist of absorbing media which scatter incident fields to spontaneous emission modes and reciprocally scatter fluctuations from noise modes to the modes of interest",
    ". the @xmath75matrix calculated previously can not be unitary for a lossy mirror but it should be the restriction to the modes of interest of a larger @xmath75matrix which includes the noise modes and obeys unitarity . in the present section ,",
    "we characterize the additional fluctuations for a lossy mirror by using the corresponding ` optical theorem ' , that is also the unitarity of the larger @xmath75matrix ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we assume that the scattering restricted to the modes of interest still fulfills the symmetry of plane mirrors considered in the previous classical calculations .",
    "this amounts to neglect multiple scattering processes which could couple different modes through their coupling with noise modes . except for this assumption",
    ", we consider arbitrary dissipative media and discuss the optical theorem in the scattering and transfer points of view .",
    "we use the latter one to deal with composition of additional fluctuations when lossy mirrors are piled up .",
    "should we use the previous classical equations for the quantum amplitudes , we would find that the output fields can not obey the canonical commutators , except in the particular case of lossless mirrors .",
    "this implies that the input / output transformation for quantum field must include additional fluctuations superimposed to the classical equations @xmath145 @xmath146 and @xmath147 are defined as in ( [ smatrix ] ) with the quantum amplitudes @xmath148 in place of the classical fields @xmath149 , @xmath150 is the same matrix as previously and @xmath151 is a twofold column matrix describing the additional fluctuations .",
    "all these quantities depend on the quantum number @xmath33 which is common to all fields coupled in the scattering process .",
    "the additional fluctuations are linear superpositions of all modes coupled to the main modes @xmath152 by the microscopic couplings which cause absorption . as an example , the atoms constituting a dielectric medium couple the main modes to all electromagnetic modes through spontaneous emission processes , represented symbolically by the wavy arrows on figure [ figaddfluct ] .",
    "the stationarity assumption implies that only modes having the same frequencies are coupled . in particular",
    ", it forbids parametric couplings which could couple modes with different frequencies and ` squeeze ' the vacuum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the whole scattering matrix which takes into account all coupled field modes is unitary and this basic property makes the canonical commutation relations compatible for input and output fields . in contrast , the reduced scattering matrix containing only the classical scattering amplitudes coupling the main modes @xmath152 is not unitary , except in the particular case of lossless mirrors .    in order to write the unitarity property of the whole scattering matrix , it is convenient to represent the additional fluctuations @xmath151 by introducing auxiliary noise modes @xmath153 and auxiliary noise amplitudes gathered in a noise matrix @xmath154 @xmath155 the components of the twofold column @xmath156 are defined to have the same canonical commutators as the input fields in the main modes .",

    "the reflection amplitude is even known to reach large resonant values at the plasmon resonances @xcite .",
    "of course , this does not prevent the stability property to be fulfilled  : the fabry - perot cavity is in this case a stable closed loop built on an open loop exceeding the unit modulus but with a phase such that the oscillation threshold is not reached .",
    "we stress again that the stability property is necessary in the derivation of the casimir force since it entails that the closed loop function is properly defined in the evanescent sector .",
    "when the more stringent property @xmath300 is also obeyed , it follows from expression ( [ loopfunctions ] ) that the airy function , which has been defined with the significance of a positive spectral density on ordinary waves , remains positive in the evanescent sector .",
    "when the property @xmath300 fails , the airy function can no longer be thought of as a spectral density in the whole physical domain , but this does not invalidate the derivation of the casimir force .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss the related but not identical properties corresponding to positivity of dissipation and passivity .",
    "we consider an arbitrary mirror , that is a reciprocal network connecting two vacuum ports .",
    "for ordinary waves , we define the power dissipated by the mirror @xmath301 where we have introduced row vectors conjugated to the column vectors @xmath302 this power is positive as a consequence of unitarity @xmath303 which corresponds to the positivity of the matrix @xmath304 @xmath305 where @xmath306 represents arbitrary input fields .",
    "positivity can also be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath111 of @xmath307 @xmath308 these eigenvalues are always real and positivity of dissipation is equivalent to the fact that they are smaller than unity @xmath309    passivity is a property directly related to positivity of dissipation but defined more generally for complex frequencies in the physical domain . in order to discuss it , we extend the matrix @xmath150 from the sector of ordinary waves through the analytical continuation already discussed . we extend @xmath310 similarly , with the complex conjugation cautiously defined since it involves complex frequencies  : conjugation corresponds to @xmath311 and @xmath312 and it preserves the physical domain @xmath313 ; the derivations performed for an amplitude in the domain @xmath314 are thus translated to similar derivations for the conjugated amplitude in the quarter plane @xmath315 .",
    "then , the domain of passivity of @xmath150 is defined by the domain of @xmath63 for which @xmath316 is a positive matrix ( eq.[defpassiv ] ) that is also for which the eigenvalues @xmath124 of @xmath307 are smaller than unity ( eq.[def2passiv ] ) .",
    "an important feature of this property is that it is stable under composition  : when two networks a and b are piled up as in figure [ figcomposition ] , the quadratic forms appearing in ( [ defpassiv ] ) simply add up so that passivity of the network ab follows from passivity of the two networks a and b. this is a special case of a general theorem @xcite which states that networks built up with passive elements are passive .",
    "passivity means that the eigenvalues @xmath317 of the matrix @xmath316 are both positive , which is equivalent to the following inequalities @xmath318 it may be written in terms of the scattering amplitudes @xmath319 passivity implies that the scattering amplitudes have a modulus smaller than unity @xmath320 conversely , the latter conditions are necessary but not sufficient for passivity .    for a mirror symmetrical in the exchange of its two ports , a slab for example ,",
    "the passivity conditions take the simple form @xmath321 .",
    "the results of appendix [ appslab ] thus entail that the domain of passivity always includes the sectors of ordinary waves and imaginary frequencies , for arbitrary slabs ( eq.[bounds ] ) . using the stability of passivity under composition",
    ", we deduce that this is also the case for arbitrary multilayers .",
    "it follows that the reflection amplitudes always have a modulus smaller than unity for imaginary frequencies ( @xmath63 real ) @xmath322 \\right| \\leq 1   \\label{passivimaginary}\\ ] ]"
