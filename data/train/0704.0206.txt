    "more recently , the phenomenon has been shown to occur also for the case in which the barrier oscillates periodically @xcite .    to our knowledge , experimental evidences of resonant activation",

    "for example , when @xmath118 the barrier fluctuations @xmath119 is hardly affected by a change in @xmath70 and the renormalization of spontaneous noise can not be neglected .",
