    "many years ago the duality of resonances at low energies and regge poles at high energies was found .",
    "the term `` duality '' means here that an amplitude can be described either by the resonances or by the reggeons .",
    "veneziano amplitude was the first example of successful implementation of hadron - reggeon duality .",
    "another example is a dual amplitude with mandelstam analyticity ( dama ) , in which the complex non - linear regge trajectories with correct thresholds can be introduced .",
    "a little bit later the quark - hadron duality was discovered by bloom and gilman .",
    "they analyzed nucleon structure function @xmath2 and have found that structure function in the nucleon resonance excitation region , averaged over resonances , with good accuracy coincides with the structure function in the deep inelastic region .",
    "the exact mathematical formulation of the duality ( both resonance - reggeon and quark - hadron ) was given on the basis of the finite - energy sum rules , formulated independently in the works .",
    "the investigation of the quark - hadron duality can improve our understanding of the structure and interaction of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "quark and gluon degrees of freedom are convenient basis for the gauge invariant theory of strong interaction  quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "hadronic degrees of freedom form other basis . since all physical quantities must not depend on the choice of the basis",
    ", the descriptions of processes in terms of quark - gluon and hadronic degrees of freedom must be equivalent .",
    "the choice of degrees of freedom for the description of hadron processes depends on specific kinematic conditions .",
    "for instance , in lepton - nucleon scattering the resonance production region is usually described using hadronic degrees of freedom , whereas the deep inelastic region is naturally described in terms of quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "formally , the quark - hadron duality is exact , but practically the necessity to cut the expansion of any fock state leads to different manifestations of the duality under various kinematic conditions and in various reactions .",
    "the duality offers additional possibilities for the investigation of nucleon structure using the data on the properties of nucleon resonances .",
    "for example , the corrections to scaling behavior of the structure function @xmath1 , calculated in qcd and measured during the last decade , can be extracted from the resonance data .    for theoretical description of the duality it s necessary to construct the structure functions in the resonance region ( threshold energies and small photon virtualities ) .",
    "for this purpose the dependence of resonance production form factors @xmath3 on photon virtuality @xmath0 must be known . in this article",
    "we construct the form factors and study the quark - hadron duality .    the experimental data , obtained in jefferson lab , served as a good incentive for this work .",
    "lepton - hadron scattering in the lowest order on electromagnetic coupling constant is described as an exchange of virtual photon with virtuality @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is four - dimensional momentum of photon ) and energy ( in nucleon rest frame ) @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is four - dimensional momentum of nucleon , @xmath8 is nucleon mass ) . in this case",
    "@xmath9 serves the role of squared momentum transferred from lepton to nucleon .",
    "the mechanism of virtual photon and nucleon interaction depends on the quantity of transferred momentum @xmath0 and photon energy . at high @xmath0 and @xmath10 noncoherent scattering of virtual photon on nucleon",
    "quarks takes place , and huge amount of hadrons is produced .    at moderate @xmath0 ( @xmath11 gev@xmath12 ) and @xmath10 internal nucleon spin states are excited , which leads to the resonance production ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    below",
    "we introduce main notations and define necessary quantities .",
    "four - dimensional momentum of nucleon , photon and resonance are denoted as @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath13 respectively . at the resonance rest frame components of this",
    "vectors read : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the mass of resonance .",
    "the vertex of virtual photon absorption by nucleon @xmath18 is described by three independent form factors @xmath19 ( or by two , when a spin of resonance equals to @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) , which are ( in the resonance rest frame)helicity amplitudes of the transition @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the helicity of resonance , nucleon and photon respectively ; @xmath27 is current operator ; @xmath26 takes values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "nucleon structure functions can be expressed in terms of form factors ( [ gspiral ] ) as follows : @xmath31\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath32\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath33\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath34\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the spin and parity of resonance respectively ; @xmath37 is the square of total energy of photon and nucleon in the c.m .",
    "frame ; @xmath38 is bjorken variable .",
    "just to remind , the structure functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are related to @xmath41 and @xmath42 by the relations @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "now , it s easy to derive the relation between structure functions @xmath45 and @xmath1 : @xmath46 this relation in the scaling limit @xmath47 under assumption @xmath48 transforms to well known callan - gross relation valid in parton model for quarks with spin 1/2",
    ".    formulae ( [ f1])([g2 ] ) determine a contribution of one infinitely narrow resonance into nucleon structure functions .",
    "for a resonance with width @xmath49 in the expressions ( [ f1])([g2 ] ) we change delta - function @xmath50 to @xmath51 in principle , this expression is not unique approximation of resonance shape .",
    "but now the particular choice of resonance contribution is not very significant .",
    "it s worth mentioning here that the expression ( [ resonance ] ) originates from the propagator of a resonance .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is to take contributions of all resonances , which data is published in literature @xcite , into account .",
    "if we let @xmath52 and @xmath53 to denote the contribution of resonance @xmath54 into spin - independent and spin - dependent structure function respectively , then the contribution of only resonances to the structure functions will be written in the form of the sum : @xmath55    to calculate resonance contribution to the structure function one must construct the form factors of resonance production as functions of photon virtuality @xmath0 . note that experimentally the dependence of form factors of known resonances @xcite on @xmath0 practically is not studied . in tables",
    "@xcite only their values at @xmath56 are listed .",
    "the transitions @xmath3 by the parity may be of two types : normal , i.e. @xmath57 and abnormal : @xmath58    about corresponding form factors @xmath19 it s known : a ) form factor threshold behavior at @xmath59 , b ) form factor asymptotic behavior at high @xmath0 , c ) form factor value at @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "so , as it was shown in , form factors of production of resonance with spin @xmath35 in case of normal parity transition @xmath3 ( [ n ] ) have the following threshold behavior : @xmath60 @xmath61 in case of abnormal parity transitions ( [ a ] ) : @xmath62 @xmath63    special case is transitions @xmath64 , which are determined by only two form factors @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 corresponds to resonance helicity @xmath68 and thus is absent for resonances with spin @xmath20 ) . their threshold behavior for the transition @xmath64 is as follows : @xmath69 @xmath70 the form factors of transition @xmath71 are determined by the expression ( [ a_g ] ) at @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath73 @xmath74    the behavior of form factors at high @xmath0 is determined by quark counting rules , according to which @xmath75    so , we suggest the expressions for form factors , possessing all the above - mentioned properties , to be written in the following form : @xmath76 for normal parity transitions and @xmath77 for abnormal parity transitions , where @xmath78 , @xmath79",
    ".    form factors of transition @xmath64 are written as : @xmath80 @xmath81    in the expressions ( [ ff_n])-([ff_a ] ) the quantities @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are free parameters , which could be determined by fitting to experimental data .",
    "the coefficient @xmath86 could be determined when the experimental data on the ratio of longitudinal and transverse cross sections of virtual photon absorption @xmath87 will become available , because of the following relation : @xmath88 by the way , the expression ( [ r ] ) together with ( [ ff_n])-([ff_a ] ) allows to determine the behavior of @xmath54 , which may be used for the experimental data analysis .",
    "the values of form factors at @xmath56 are related to helicity amplitudes of photoproduction @xmath89 and @xmath90 , listed in @xcite , as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is electron charge .",
    "note , that longitudinal form factor at @xmath56 turns to zero : @xmath93 .    substituting expressions ( [ f1])-([g2 ] ) , written for each particular resonance , taking into account parity of the transition and using proper expressions for form factors , to ( [ strfun_sum ] ) , we get the structure functions in the resonance region :    @xmath94\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    @xmath95\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    @xmath96\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 , @xmath98 for normal parity transitions and @xmath99 , @xmath100 for abnormal parity transitions , and the sum is over the resonances .",
    "we take into account the contributions of the following resonances : @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "the above expressions determine resonance contribution into nucleon structure functions .",
    "it s obvious that the production of resonances in electron - nucleon scattering is not the only process , contributing to structure functions .",
    "the production of mesons and other hadrons forms non - resonant background , which also must be taken into account .",
    "non - resonant background could be parameterized @xcite as : @xmath122^{n-1/2}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 , @xmath124 are fitting coefficients , @xmath125 is threshold energy .",
    "so finally we obtained nucleon structure functions in the resonance region , dependent on bjorken variable and photon virtuality .",
    "let s consider , following , how the expressions for structure functions ( [ f1_res_fin])-([g2_res_fin ] ) , which contain resonance terms , which have strong dependence on @xmath0 ( because of form factors ) , change over in the limit of high @xmath0 to scaling expressions , which weakly depend on @xmath0 .",
    "we change over to the variable @xmath126 , which is related to bjorken @xmath38 as follows : @xmath127    let s consider the case of infinitely narrow resonances , i.e. @xmath128 . at that ,",
    "structure function will be nonzero only at those values of @xmath129 , at which @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 .",
    "one may easily see , that the resonance shifts to the region @xmath132 as @xmath0 increases . at that , as experimental data indicate , the resonance follows the scaling curve .",
    "the form of this curve can be evidently derived from the expressions for structure functions in resonance region by the substitution @xmath133 .    in the case of resonances with finite width",
    "the equality @xmath130 is approximate , which leads to corrections to scaling behavior , which are proportional to @xmath134 .    in this paper",
    "we restrict the consideration to the structure function @xmath1 .",
    "it s worth mentioning that structure function @xmath135 is sensitive , unlike the @xmath1 , to longitudinal form factor and relative values of @xmath65 and @xmath67 , because they are included in ( [ g2_res_fin ] ) as a difference .    in ( [ f2_res_fin ] )",
    "we change over to the variable @xmath129 and at high @xmath0 get : @xmath136\\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] it follows from ( [ scalex ] ) that as @xmath137 the structure function @xmath138 .",
    "often ,   in the resonance region , nachtmann variable @xmath139 is used ( variable @xmath140 is not convenient for the analysis of structure function in resonance region , because all resonances are densely situated in region @xmath141 ) . from the inequality @xmath142 , it s easy to derive that @xmath143 .",
    "the dependence of resonance part of the structure function @xmath1 on nahtmann variable @xmath144 at various values of @xmath0 is shown on fig .",
    "specific values of @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , used to plot fig",
    ". 2 , are not significant at this point .",
    "solid line corresponds to the fit to deep inelastic data for @xmath148 .",
    "one can see , that @xmath111-isobar makes the largest contribution to the structure function .",
    "non - resonant background in this region appears to be relatively small , unlike the regions corresponding to more massive resonances .",
    "one can also see that the @xmath111 peak exactly follows the scaling curve as @xmath0 changes , which is a manifestation of the duality .    for the comparison with experimental data",
    "the parametrization of non - resonant background contribution must be carried out .",
    "however now this problem has no unique solution .",
    "taking the non - resonant background into account must lead to the rise of the structure function in the region of higher resonances the way it follows the scaling curve ( in varying @xmath0 ) in broad region of @xmath144 .",
    "the equality , discovered by bloom and gilman , of nucleon structure function @xmath1 , averaged over big enough domain of scaling variable , in resonance region and in deep inelastic region confirmed the existence of quark - hadron duality , i.e. the possibility of the description of processes using the language of either only hadronic or quark degrees of freedom .",
    "expressions for form factors of nucleon resonance production , obtained in this work , taking into account correct threshold behavior and experimental data on resonance decays , may serve as starting ones for the investigation on nucleon properties in the language of hadronic degrees of freedom .      in future , we plan to investigate structure function @xmath135 , which gets essential contribution from the longitudinal form factor . numerical verification of our model is also interesting and will be carried out as new experimental data become available .",
