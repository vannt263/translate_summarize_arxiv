    "<S> , it has been realized that the effect of geometrical frustration is a potentially fruitful but relatively unexplored frontier in this context . from a theoretical perspective </S>",

    "<S> ( [ fig : ahe1 ] ) ) and @xmath111 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : ahe2 ] ) ) . in the @xmath9 phase , @xmath112 is monotonic , and increases with increasing kondo coupling strength @xmath3 , whereas in the @xmath10 phase , @xmath109 generally is not monotonic .    </S>",
    "<S> our results display an additional key feature , namely @xmath109 jumps across the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> even though in the streda formula , @xmath113 is computed as a bulk integral , it is intrinsically a fermi surface property @xcite ( other than contributions from fully occupied bands ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the nonanalytic reconstruction of the total berry curvature distribution @xmath114 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : bc ] ) . across the qcp , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi - surface jump is accompanied by a non - analytic reconstruction of the quasiparticle wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that , in both cases , the berry curvature distribution is concentrated near their respective fermi surfaces .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussion_. in the kondo - destroyed @xmath9 phase , the @xmath7-moments chirality acts as an external `` source field '' inducing a mirror spin chirality in the conduction electrons sector , with @xmath3 being the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting zero field ahe , @xmath113 , naturally grows with the increasing @xmath3 . across the qcp </S>",
    "<S> , the continuous onset of the kondo resonance leads to a singular reconstruction of the fermi surfaces and berry curvatures , yielding a jump of @xmath113 across the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> this bears a similarity with the normal hall effect of a conventional antiferromagnetic heavy fermion material , which was shown to jump in the zero - temperature limit as a consequence of a sudden change of the fermi surface volume @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be tested in pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , once a control parameter is identified to tune across the zero - field qcp @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the anomalous hall conductance from the mechanism advanced here is typically on the order of a few percent of the quantum unit @xmath115 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : ahe ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to that observed in pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , in which the maximal sheet @xmath113 can be estimated to be about 0.7% of @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have emphasized the role of the kondo effect ( and its destruction ) . </S>",
    "<S> more realistically , future work should go beyond the lattice we have studied which , while featuring geometrical frustration , is simplified compared with that of pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , as well as incorporate the non - kramers nature of the ground - state crystal - field level of the pr ions @xcite and more realistic forms of the conduction - electron bandstructure . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect our conclusion to remain qualitatively valid in the more realistic settings , given the substantial evidence for the kondo effect in pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 , including from the large entropy observed in the pertinent low - temperature regime @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it may also be instructive to explore related effects in other @xmath7-electron systems with geometrical frustration , such as ucu@xmath117 at the ambient condition @xcite and when suitably tuned through a qcp .    </S>",
    "<S> we close by proposing an engineered kondo - insulator interface as a model material for the frustrated kondo lattice hamiltonian studied here . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for the proposed setting comes from recent advances in the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) of kondo systems @xcite . as a promising candidate material </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the golden phase of sms ( @xmath85-sms ) . in bulk samples this phase is stable under pressures between about 0.65gpa @xcite and 2gpa @xcite . as mbe thin - film </S>",
    "<S> the phase might be stabilized by lattice mismatch with an appropriate substrate . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85-sms crystallizes in a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) structure of rock - salt ( nacl ) type . </S>",
    "<S> a lattice plane is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sms ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85-sms shows characteristics of a kondo insulating state in transport @xcite , thermodynamics @xcite , and point contact spectroscopy @xcite . from thermal expansion and heat capacity measurements </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap was estimated to be 90k on the low - pressure side of the @xmath85-sms phase @xcite . at temperatures low compared to this scale </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed lattice plane could then serve as a setting to realize the frustrated @xmath2 kondo lattice and study the anomalous hall effect .     </S>",
