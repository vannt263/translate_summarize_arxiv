    "the coexistence of competing selfish individuals is an ubiquitous issue in the study of systems described by the modern darwinian paradigm , known as the `` evolutionary synthesis '' @xcite . in the context of prebiotic or chemical evolution , this matter surfaced with the observation by @xcite that , due to the finite fidelity of replication , the information content of a single self - replicating macromolecule ( a template for short ) is far too few to permit the coding of macromolecules with any functional complexity .",
    "a way out of this difficulty , so - called the information crisis of prebiotic evolution , is to assume the information is distributed among a number of distinct template types and enforce cyclic cooperative interactions among them  the hypercycle  to guarantee coexistence @xcite .",
    "alternatively , coexistence between distinct template types can be achieved by confining the templates in packages or protocells and requiring that the survival or the reproduction chances of a protocell be dependent on its template composition @xcite .",
    "the study of this two - level selection problem can be carried out by introducing minor changes on the mathematical models developed to address the efficiency of group selection to maintain an altruistic trait @xcite . in particular , in a recent paper we have used a diffusion model of group selection @xcite to study analytically the conditions for the coexistence of two template types which differ on their replication rates @xcite . however , that study left out a crucial characteristic of the primitive protocell populations , namely , the elevated exchange flux of templates among protocells , known as lateral or horizontal gene transfer .",
    "in fact , the acceptance of the operation of this process in the early history of microbial life has wiped out completely the familiar darwinian notion of a universal ancestor @xcite .    here",
    "we model the process of template swapping among protocells by the classic migration process of wright s island model @xcite .",
    "we find that introduction of migration renders the evolutionary process ergodic in the sense that the steady state does not depend on the initial set - up of the population .",
    "in addition , migration allows a steady - state solution corresponding to protocells carrying both template types ( coexistence regime ) or a solution where the more efficient template type is fixed in all protocells ( homogeneous regime ) .",
    "there is a smooth transition between these two regimes provided that the two template types exhibit distinct replication rates . in the degenerate case , where the template types have identical replication efficiencies , only the coexistence regime is stable",
    "this contrasts with the results obtained in the absence of migration , for which there is a non - ergodic segregation regime characterized by a mixture of two types of protocells , each type carrying solely one of the template types @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the three evolutionary processes  template competition , migration and intercell competition  that comprise the dynamics of our two - level selection model , and derive the partial differential equation that governs the time evolution of the fraction of protocells carrying a given template composition .",
    "[ sec : steady ] is devoted to the numerical and analytical study of the steady - state solutions of that equation .",
    "in particular , our numerical approach relies on the interpretation of the steady - state ordinary differential equation as an eigenvalue problem whose eigenvalue corresponds to the mean group selection pressure .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] . in appendix",
    "a we present the analytical calculation of the probability that a template type fixates in a given protocell in the non - ergodic segregation regime for the case migration is not allowed .",
    "this calculation generalizes that presented in @xcite by taking into account the different replication efficiencies of the template types .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a hypothetical population divided into an infinite number of competing protocells , each of which containing exactly @xmath0 templates .",
    "there are two types of templates which differ only by their replication efficiency : type 1 templates have a selective disadvantage @xmath1 relative to type 2 templates , where @xmath2 is a parameter on the order of @xmath3 . more pointedly , type 1 templates are assigned fitness @xmath4 and type 2 templates fitness @xmath5 . in addition , we assume that @xmath0 is large enough so that the frequency of type 1 templates within a protocell , denoted by @xmath6 , can be viewed as a continuous variable in the interval @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "of course , the frequency of type 2 templates within the same protocell is @xmath8 .",
    "the population is described by the fraction of protocells @xmath9 whose frequency of type 1 templates lies in the range @xmath10 at time @xmath11 .",
    "our goal is to determine how the probability density @xmath12 is affected by the three evolutionary processes : individual template competition within a protocell , migration of templates between protocells and competition between protocells .",
    "the template competition process within each protocell takes place according to the rules of the standard wright - fisher model of population genetics @xcite .",
    "in particular , assuming that a protocell contains @xmath13 type 1 templates and @xmath14 type 2 templates , the probability that there will be exactly @xmath15 type 1 templates after template competition is given by the wright - fisher process @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the relative fitness of the subpopulation of type 1 templates in the protocell . to determine how this process affects the probability density @xmath12 we resort to the diffusion approximation of population genetics @xcite , which consists essentially on the calculation of the jump moments @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the frequencies of type 1 templates before and after template competition , respectively .",
    "here @xmath22 stands for an average using the transition probability @xmath23 .",
    "these moments contribute to the drift and the diffusion terms of a forward kolmogorov - like equation for @xmath12 .",
    "more pointedly , direct evaluation of the jump moments to first order in @xmath3 using the transition probability ( [ rij ] ) yields @xmath24 and @xmath25 where we have used that the fitness disadvantage @xmath1 of the type 1 templates is on the order of @xmath3 .",
    "migration follows wright s island model @xcite that posits that @xmath26 templates of each protocell are replaced by migrants in the time interval @xmath27 and that the frequency of type 1 templates among the migrants is equal to the average frequency of type 1 templates in the entire protocell population , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the probability that a protocell with @xmath13 type 1 templates ( @xmath20 ) becomes a protocell with @xmath15 type 1 templates ( @xmath29 ) due to the migration process is then @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "here the hyper - geometric component yields the probability that exactly @xmath33 type 1 templates and @xmath34 type 2 templates are eliminated from the protocell to make room for the @xmath26 migrants , whereas the binomial part yields the probability that there are exactly @xmath35 type 1 templates among the @xmath26 migrants .",
    "after migration the number of type 1 templates in the protocell is given by the sum of the type 1 templates originally in the protocell @xmath36 and the number of type 1 templates among the migrants @xmath37 .",
    "the first two jump moments are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for an average using the transition probability @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the fraction of the protocell population that is replaced by migrants . assuming that @xmath43 is on the order of @xmath3 , i.e. , that the number of migrants @xmath26 remains finite and limited when @xmath0 grows large , we can neglect the second jump moment which is @xmath44 .",

    "we note that whereas the linear forward kolmogorov equation is the standard output in the case of random drift and individual selection @xcite , eq .  ( [ eqphi ] )",
    "is nonlinear because of the presence of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are associated to migration and group selection .",
    "in addition , the singularities ( if any ) of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqphi ] ) must be integrable so as to guarantee that it is normalizable for all times .",
    "kimura s choice for the intercell selection coefficient , @xmath66 , aimed at exploring the efficiency of group selection to maintain an altruistic character  the type 1 template in that case  which has a selective disadvantage @xmath1 relative to its competitor but whose presence would boost the protocell reproduction rate , which increases linearly with the frequency of altruists inside it .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a rigorous analysis of the linear intercell selection model introduced by @xcite and to @xcite for the analysis of the nonlinear variant of kimura s model . here",
    "we consider the coexistence problem instead , which is more burdensome to group selection than the altruistic version , since the fixation of a template type through the effect of random drift , regardless of its selective advantage or disadvantage , acts against coexistence @xcite .",

    "@xmath69 is a parameter on the order of @xmath5 that measures the intensity of the group selection pressure towards coexistence .",
    "the idea behind eq .",
    "( [ presc ] ) is that the two functional template types coded for a small piece of a modular enzyme which then promoted protocell replication @xcite . since the hookup of the replicase requires products from the two template types , its production rate is proportional to the concentration of the rare type , hence the requirement that @xmath45 is maximized by well - balanced protocells .",
    "the model has three parameters , namely , @xmath70 that measures the selective disadvantage of type 1 templates in the within cell competition process , @xmath71 that measures the strength of migration , and @xmath69 that measures the strength of the group selection pressure towards template coexistence .",

    "we note that in the absence of the coexistence pressure @xmath86 , the regular solution is missing @xcite .",
    "however , one can easily verify that the migration term prohibits solutions which are combinations of the three possibilities ( i.e. , the deltas at @xmath87 and @xmath88 and the regular solution ) , since in that case eq .",

    "hence , in spite of the fact that @xmath81 describes a regime of coexistence , this coexistence can be very unbalanced in the sense that the majority of the protocells may be populated by essentially a single template type .",
    "this unbalance is typical in the case @xmath95 .",
    "the steady - state solutions of a diffusion model of intergroup selection for the maintenance of an altruistic trait were obtained numerically by @xcite in the simple case of a linear group selection pressure @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath97 . in that case eq .",
    "( [ stat1 ] ) exhibits only one non - local term and a straightforward self - consistent iterative approach yields the correct solution . in our case",

    "we should mention , however , that within the context of the maintenance of cooperation the group selection or , more generally , the multilevel selection approach has been applied to the study of the dynamics of cancer , which may be viewed as a result of the breakdown of cooperation between cells in the body @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we build on the seminal paper by @xcite , which presented a diffusion model incorporating group selection , and study a group selection pressure towards the coexistence of two types of templates that are differentiated by their replication rates .",
    "our focus is on the effect of template swapping ( migration ) among protocells .",
    "this is a key process within the modern prebiotic scenario , which is based on the radical notion of an ancestral community of cell lines lacking long - term genetic history and individuality , rather than of a single ancestral organism @xcite .",
    "we find that the progression of the template type that exhibits the selective advantage at the individual level is greatly promoted by migration , in the same manner that an antibiotic resistant gene spreads among a population comprising different bacterial species . in that sense",
    ", migration hinders coexistence .",
    "nevertheless , migration is very effective to counterweight the homogenizing effect of random drift ( i.e. , the fixation of a template type ) so that in the degenerate case , where there is no selective advantage at the individual level , coexistence is the only possible outcome of the evolutionary process .",
    "in addition , even in the non - degenerate case , a small amount of template swapping increases greatly the parameter range for which coexistence is stable in comparison with the case where there is no migration at all .",
    "an interesting aspect of the diffusion model of group selection is the existence of a continuous transition between a homogeneous regime dominated by the more efficient template type and a coexistence regime where the two template types cohabit a same protocell .",
    "the order parameter that characterizes these regimes is the eigenvalue @xmath108 of the eigenvalue problem ( [ stat1 ] ) , whose eigenfunction is the fraction of protocells with a given template composition at the the steady state . in particular , we find @xmath177 in the coexistence regime , and @xmath178 in the homogeneous regime with @xmath108 vanishing linearly with the distance to the critical line that separates those regimes .",
    "a simplifying feature of the model with migration is that the evolutionary dynamics is ergodic , i.e. , the steady - state solution does not depend on the details of the initial distribution of templates among the protocells , provided the two template types are present in the population at the initial time .",
    "in fact , in the homogeneous phase the more efficient template type fixates in all protocells with probability one , whereas in the coexistence phase the distribution of template compositions inside the protocells are described univocally by the regular solution of eq .",
    "( [ stat1 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics is non - ergodic only in the segregating phase that appears for low coexistence pressure values in the case migration is not allowed @xcite . for that case , we derive in appendix a exact analytical expressions for the probability that one of the two template types fixates in a given protocell .",
    "most interestingly , this kind of local fixation occurs both in the ergodic and in the non - ergodic phases of the model in the absence of migration and so this model offers a rare instance of subdivided population where the ( local ) fixation probabilities can be calculated exactly @xcite .    to conclude , a word is in order about the stability of the steady - state solutions of the non - linear ( and non - local ) partial differential equation that determines the time evolution of the protocell population , eq .",
    "( [ eqphi ] ) . on physical grounds",
    "one expects the existence of a coexistence regime for large values of the coexistence group selection pressure @xmath69 and so the stability of the steady - state regular solution @xmath179 , which satisfies eq .  ( [ stat1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , in the absence of the coexistence pressure ( @xmath86 ) the only steady - state solution is the homogeneous one , i.e. , @xmath180 . whereas the regular solution exists for @xmath181 only , the homogeneous solution exists for all @xmath182 and so a possible instability of the regular solution at a finite value of @xmath161 would shift the transition point as well as turn the transition from continuous to discontinuous , in the sense that the eigenvalue @xmath108 would jump to zero at the new hypothetical transition point .",
    "the analysis of the stability of the steady - state solutions by techniques such as the spectral theory in infinite dimensions @xcite is a most interesting and challenging enterprise that could reveal the influence of the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath71 on the relaxation time to equilibrium as well as confirm the steady - state prediction of the critical point @xmath183 separating the homogeneous and coexistence regimes .",
    "we hope our paper will motivate further studies on this research line .",
    "as shown by @xcite , setting @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ stat1 ] ) yields two possible steady - state solutions : the solution corresponding to the ergodic coexistence phase , which is a combination of two delta functions and a regular function , @xmath184 , with @xmath185 , and the solution corresponding to the non - ergodic segregation phase , which is a combination of the two delta functions , @xmath186 , with @xmath143 .",
    "the non - ergodic regime , which is our focus here , occurs for @xmath173 .",
    "note that in both regimes @xmath187 may be interpreted as the probability that the type 1 template fixates in a given protocell and a similar interpretation holds for @xmath188 as well .",
