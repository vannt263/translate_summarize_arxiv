    "the idea of a negative - pressure dark component which accounts for @xmath1 of the critical density seems to be strongly supported by the current cosmological observations . very little",
    ", however , is known about the nature of this extra component , a fact that has opened the possibility for many speculations on its fundamental origin and has also given rise to the so - called dark energy problem .",
    "these speculations are usually based either on a particular choice of the equation of state ( eos ) characterizing the dark energy ( @xmath2 ) @xcite or on modifications of gravity at very large scales @xcite .",
    "however , irrespective of the choice made , a consensus is being reached nowadays on the fact that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to single out the best - fit model of dark energy on the basis only of observational data ( see @xcite for some attempts to physically constrain the nature of the dark energy ) .",
    "the above conclusion , in turn , leads inevitably to a pessimist attitute towards the observational investigation of dark energy . however , as well observed by kratochvil _",
    "@xcite , one may , instead of trying to find which dark energy scenario is correct , test which models can be ruled out by the available observations .",
    "this , of course , will not unveil the nature of the dark energy but may , with the current and upcoming observational data , diminish considerably the range of possibilitites .",
    "an interesting example involves two of the favorite candidates for dark energy , namely , the vacuum energy density or the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) and a dynamical scalar field ( @xmath3 ) , usually called _",
    "quintessence_. among other things , what observationally differs these two candidates for dark energy is that , in the former case , the eos associated with @xmath0 is constant along the evolution of the universe ( @xmath4 ) whereas in generic quintessence scenarios @xmath5 is a function of the scalar field @xmath6 as well as of its potential @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , taking this small but important difference into account , one may conclude that if any observable deviation from a constant equation of state is consistently found , this naturally poses a problem for any model based on this assumption , which includes our current concordance scenario ( @xmath0cdm ) .    following this reasoning",
    ", we aim , in this paper , to explore the prospects for constraining possible time dependence of dark energy from a joint analysis involving radio - selected gravitational lens statistics and supernova ( sne ia ) data . to this end",
    ", we use the most recent radio sources gravitational lensing sample , namely , the cosmic all sky survey ( class ) statistical data which consist of 8958 radio sources out of which 13 sources are multiply imaged @xcite and the recently published sne ia data set with a total of 157 events @xcite .",
    "this particular combination of lensing statistics and sne ia data has been used by some authors to this very same end @xcite ( and also to place limits on constant eos models @xcite ) and constitutes a potential probe for possible variations of the dark energy eos since it covers a considerable interval of redshift , which is a necessary condition to properly distinguish redshift - dependent equation of states from models with constant @xmath5 . by considering three different parametrizations for the time - dependence of the dark energy",
    ", it is shown that this combination of observational data restricts considerably the dark energy parameter space , which enables possible distinctions between time - dependent and constant eos s .",
    "in this work , we are particularly interested in three specific parametrizations for the variation of @xmath5 with redshift , i.e. , @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the current value of the equation - of - state parameter , and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are free parameters quantifying the time - dependence of the dark energy eos , which must be adjusted by the observational data .",
    "note that the eos of the cosmological constant can be always recovered by taking @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the taylor expansion ( p1 ) was firstly suggested in ref . @xcite . constraints on ( p1 ) were firstly studied by cooray & huterer @xcite by using sne ia data , gravitational lensing statistics and globular clusters ages and also by goliath _",
    "@xcite who investigated limits to this parametrization from future sne ia experiments . as commented in ref .",
    "@xcite , p1 is a good approximation for most quintessence models out to redshift of a few and it is exact for models where the equation of state is a constant or changing slowly .",
    "p1 , however , has serious problems to explain age estimates of high-@xmath17 objects since it predictes very small ages at @xmath18 @xcite ( in reality , p1 blows up at high - redshifts as @xmath19 for values of @xmath20  see eq .",
    "( 4 ) below ) .",
    "the empirical fit p2 was introduced by efstathiou @xcite who argued that for a wide class of potentials associated to dynamical scalar field models the evolution of @xmath8 at @xmath21 is well approximated by eq .",
    "p3 was recently proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) aiming at solving undesirable behaviours of p1 at high redshifts . according to @xcite , this parametrization is a good fit for many theoretically conceivable scalar field potentials , as well as for small recent deviations from a pure cosmological constant behaviour ( @xmath4 ) [ see also @xcite for other parametrizations ] .    since eqs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) represent separately conserved components , it is straightforward to show from the energy conservation law [ @xmath22 that the ratio @xmath23 for ( p1)-(p3 ) evolves , respectively , as @xmath24 , \\ ] ] @xmath25 } , \\ ] ] @xmath26,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath27 denotes present day quantities and @xmath28 is the cosmological scale factor .",

    "we fix @xmath32 , in accordance with several dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "in our search to constrain a possible time - dependence of the dark energy , we adopt a joint analysis involving the so far largest lensing sample suitable for statistical analysis along with the latest sne ia data , as provided by riess _",
    "_ @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we discuss both the lensing and sne ia samples used as well as the main assumptions on which we performed our joint analysis .",
    "the final class well - defined statistical sample consists of 8958 radio sources out of which 13 sources are multiply imaged .",
    "here we work only with those multiply imaged sources whose image - splittings are known ( or likely ) to be caused by single galaxies .",
    "there are 9 such radio sources : 0218 + 357 , 0445 + 123 , 0631 + 519 , 0712 + 472 , 0850 + 054 , 1152 + 199 , 1422 + 231 , 1933 + 503 , 2319 + 051 .",
    "we thus work with a total of 8954 radio sources @xcite .",
    "the sources probed by class at @xmath33 ghz are well represented by power - law differential number - flux density relation : @xmath34 with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) where @xmath39 mjy @xcite .",
    "the class unlensed sources can be adequately described by a gaussian model with mean redshift , @xmath40 and a dispersion of @xmath41 .",
    "we start our analysis by assuming the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model for the lens mass distribution .",
    "as has been discussed elsewhere this assumption represents a good approximation to the real mass distribution in galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the present analysis",
    "we also ignore the evolution of the number density of galaxies and assume that the comoving number density is conserved . the present day comoving number density of galaxies is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the well known schechter luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the differential optical depth of lensing in traversing @xmath44 with angular separation between @xmath3 and @xmath45 is @xcite : @xmath46\\frac{d\\phi}{\\phi } dz_{l } , \\label{diff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 the quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent , respectively , the angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source and between the lens and the source . in order to relate the characteristic luminosity @xmath52 to the characteristic velocity dispersion @xmath53",
    ", we use the faber - jackson relation @xcite for early - type galaxies ( @xmath54 ) , with @xmath55 . for the analysis presented here we neglect the contribution of spirals as lenses because their velocity dispersion is small when compared to ellipticals .    0.1 in    the two large - scale galaxy surveys , namely",
    ", the 2dfgrs and the sdss have produced converging results on the total lf .",
    "the surveys determined the schechter parameters for galaxies ( all types ) at @xmath56 .",
    "chae @xcite has worked extensively on the information provided by these recent galaxy surveys to extract the local type - specific lfs . for our analysis here , we adopt the normalization corrected schechter parameters of the 2dfgrs survey @xcite : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    the normalized image angular separation distribution for a source at @xmath61",
    "is obtained by integrating @xmath62 over @xmath63 :    @xmath64    the corrected ( for magnification and selection effects ) image separation distribution function for a single source at redshift @xmath61 is given by @xcite @xmath65^{{\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}(\\alpha + 1 + { \\frac{4}{\\gamma } } ) }   \\,f^{*}\\,{cdt\\over dz_{l } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\exp\\left[- \\,\\left({d_{os}\\over{d_{ls } } } \\phi\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{2}}\\right ] { ( 1 + z_{l})^{3 } \\over \\gamma\\left(\\alpha + { 4\\over\\gamma } + 1\\right ) }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left[\\,\\left ( { d_{ol}d_{ls}\\over r_0    d_{os}}\\right)^{2}\\,{1\\over r_0}\\right ] \\,\\,{dz_{l}}. \\label{dist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , the corrected lensing probability for a given source at redshift @xmath17 is given by @xmath66 here @xmath3 and @xmath67 are related to as @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the magnification bias .",
    "this is considered because , as is widely known , gravitational lensing causes a magnification of images and this transfers the lensed sources to higher flux density bins .",
    "in other words , the lensed sources are over - represented in a flux - limited sample .",
    "the magnification bias @xmath70 increases the lensing probability significantly in a bin of total flux density ( @xmath71 ) by a factor @xmath72 in the above expression , @xmath73 is the intrinsic flux density relation for the source population at redshift @xmath61 . @xmath73 gives the number of sources at redshift @xmath61 having flux greater than @xmath71 . for the sis model ,",
    "the magnification probability distribution is @xmath74 .",
    "the minimum and maximum total magnifications @xmath75 and @xmath76 in equation ( [ b2 ] ) depend on the observational characteristics as well as on the lens model . for the sis model ,",
    "the minimum total magnification is @xmath77 and the maximum total magnification is @xmath78 .",
    "the magnification bias @xmath79 depends on the differential number - flux density relation @xmath80 .",
    "the differential number - flux relation needs to be known as a function of the source redshift . at present redshifts of only a few class sources",
    "are known .",
    "we , therefore , ignore redshift dependence of the differential number - flux density relation .",
    "following chae @xcite , we further ignore the dependence of the differential number - flux density relation on the spectral index of the source .",
    "two important selection criteria for class statistical sample are ( i ) that the ratio of the flux densities of the fainter to the brighter images @xmath81 is @xmath82 .",
    "given such an observational limit , the minimum total magnification for double imaging the adopted model of the lens is @xmath83 @xcite ; ( ii ) that the image components in lens systems must have separations @xmath84  arcsec .",
    "we incorporate this selection criterion by setting the lower limit of @xmath85 in equation ( [ prob ] ) as @xmath86 arcsec .      the sne ia sample of riess _",
    "_ @xcite consists of 186 events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath87 and constitutes the compilation of the best observations made so far by the two supernova search teams plus 16 new events observed by _",
    "this total data - set was divided into `` high - confidence '' ( _ gold _ ) and `` likely but not certain '' ( _ silver _ ) subsets . here",
    ", we will consider only the 157 events that constitute the so - called _ gold _ sample .",
    "the best fit to the set of parameters @xmath88 is obtained by using a @xmath89 statistics , i.e. , @xmath90^{2}}{\\sigma_i^{2}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the predicted distance modulus for a supernova at redshift @xmath17 , @xmath92 is the extinction corrected distance modulus for a given sne ia at @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the uncertainty in the individual distance moduli , which includes uncertainties in galaxy redshift due to a peculiar velocity of 400 km / s .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath95 is considered a  nuisance \" parameter so that we marginalize over it ( for some recent sne ia studies , see @xcite ) .      the main results of our joint analysis are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "panels 1a-1c show the confidence regions ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) in the @xmath98 plane for p1 , p2 and p3 , respectively . as stated earlier ,",
    "the matter density parameter has been fixed in all analyses at @xmath99 , in agreement with some clustering estimates @xcite .",
    "the contours are defined by the conventional two - parameter @xmath100 levels ( 2.30 and 6.17 ) , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the normalized likelihood for lenses . from this combination of observational data we find that the best - fit parameters for p1 are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which corresponds to an accelerating scenario with transition redshift ( at which the universe switches from acceleration to acceleration ) @xmath105 and a total expanding age of @xmath106 gyr . for parametrizations 2 and 3",
    "the best - fit scenarios occur at @xmath107 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 and @xmath110 , corresponding to a @xmath111-gyr - old and @xmath112-gyr - old universes with transition redshifts at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "note that the estimates of @xmath115 for p2 and p3 are inside the 1@xmath116 interval inferred for the transition redshift from the current sne ia data @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit values for each parametrization also imply a beginning of a phantom behavior at @xmath117 ( p1 ) , @xmath118 ( p2 ) and @xmath119 ( p3 ) .    from the above figures , however , it is clear the most important conclusion one may reach resides on the fact that for the three parametrizations considered in this paper the joint class + sne ia analysis clearly prefers the regions where @xmath120 , i.e. , a time - dependent eos . in particular , note that the point @xmath15 , which means a time - independent eos , is at least 2@xmath116 off from the central values obtained for this parameter .",
    "such a result seems to be more restrictive than that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which a combination of the latest sne ia , cosmic microwave background and large - scale structure data showed no hint of departures from the model corresponding to einstein s cosmological constant ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is possible that this particular preference for a time - dependent eos changes if the current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data were included in the analysis . as discussed in @xcite , an evolving dark energy eos affects the features of temperature anisotropies in cmb in at least two ways , namely , the position of the acoustic peaks as well as the integrated sachs - wolf efect",
    "however , if independent analyses involving a more significant number of different data sets confirm this preference of the observational data for values of @xmath120 , these results surely will bring to light a new consistency problem for our current standard cosmological model since for this case @xmath13 is necessarily null .",
    "very recently , the field of cosmology has entered a golden era .",
    "an era where new and revolutionary concepts were introduced with the support of a plethora of high - quality observational data . surely , the most remarkable among these concepts is the idea of a dark energy - dominated universe , which is motivated from an impressive convergence of independent observational results .",
    "this idea in turn gave rise to the so - called dark energy problem since the nature of this dark component is completely unknown at present .",
    "in this paper , although aware of the impossibility of determining the nature of the dark energy on the basis only of observational data , we have considered the possibility of discriminating two of our favorite candidates for this mysterious component , namely , the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) and a dynamical scalar field ( @xmath3 ) [ 33 ] . by considering three different parametrizations for the dark enegy eos , we have placed limits on the time - dependent term of these parametrizations ( @xmath13 ) from a joint analysis involving the most recent radio sources gravitational lensing sample and sne ia data .",
    "we have shown that this particular combination of observational data prefer values of @xmath120 , i.e. , a time - dependent eos .",
    "we believe that if such a result is confirmed by the upcoming observations , it may shed some light on our search for a better understanding of the nature of the so - called dark energy .",
