    "the three - body continuum coulomb problem is one of the fundamental unresolved problems of theoretical physics . in atomic physics ,",
    "a prototype example is a two - electron continuum which arises as a final state in electron - impact ionization and double photoionization of atomic systems .",
    "several discrete - basis - set methods for the calculation of such processes have recently been developed including convergent close coupling ( ccc ) @xcite , the coulomb - sturmian separable expansion method @xcite , the j - matrix method @xcite . in all these approaches ( see also @xcite ) the continuous hamiltonian spectrum is represented in the context of complete square integrable bases . despite the enormous progress made so far in discretization and subsequent numerical solutions of three - body differential and integral equations of the coulomb scattering theory , a number of related mathematical problems remain open",
    ". actually , the use of a product of two fixed charge coulomb waves for the two outgoing electrons as an approximation to the three - body continuum state is typical of these approaches . as a consequence , a long - range potential appears in the kernel of the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "since this integral equation is non - compact , its solution therefore is divergent as the size of a @xmath1 basis used to describe the potential is increased .",
    "note that a renormalization approach can not cure this problem .    a theoretical treatment of coulomb breakup problems ( which does not require screening or any regularization ) has been recently suggested by kadyrov et al .",
    "@xcite .    in several papers @xcite a new approach for solution of the three - body continuum coulomb problem was introduced .",
    "the development of the method is chiefly based upon the fact that the asymptotic wave operator , which determines the wave function behavior when all interparticle distances are large ( in the @xmath2 domain ) , is separable in terms of generalized parabolic coordinates @xcite .",
    "the parabolic coordinate eigenfunctions of the asymptotic wave operator which satisfy the redmond s conditions @xcite in the asymptotic domain @xmath2 are expressed in terms of a product of three two - body coulomb functions , each depending of one parabolic coordinate . these functions ,",
    "often called the c3 ( or bbk ) wave functions @xcite , are successfully used as the final - state wave functions for calculating cross sections for electron - impact ionization and double photoionization of helium @xcite . in @xcite it has been proposed to use an integral equation of a lippmann - schwinger type to construct an approximate solution that describe three charged particles moving in the three - body continuum . in this integral equation",
    "the green s function in the whole configuration space ( and not just in the domain @xmath2 ) is approximated by the inverse of the asymptotic wave operator . in turn ,",
    "the well - known non - orthogonal part of the kinetic energy operator , which represents the difference between the total and asymptotic wave operators , plays the role of the potential .",
    "asymptotic behavior of solutions is determined by the inhomogeneous term which is given by the c3 wave function .    to test the practicality of the lippmann - schwinger equation approach , we restrict ourselves to the so - called outgoing approximation @xcite , which assumes that the sought - for solution ( as well as the inhomogeneity ) depends only on the parabolic coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and therefore the approximate potential operator contains only the terms which involve the mixed derivatives @xmath5 , @xmath6 . in this work",
    "we address the question of compactness of the kernel of the integral equation .",
    "any compact operator may be approximated arbitrary closely by an operator of finite rank . in order to study the properties of the kernel we choose the parabolic sturmian basis set @xcite and construct a sequence of separable kernels .",
    "then to check the existence of a limit of this sequence we examine the convergence behavior of the first few expansion coefficients of the solution as the basis set is increased .",
    "the coefficients are found to exhibit oscillations whose amplitude does not decrease as the number of terms in the representation of the potential grows .",
    "this result is similar to the gibbs phenomenon known from fourier analysis ( see , e. g. , @xcite ) , where the oscillation of an approximant about the exact function ( which possesses a discontinuity ) is a consequence of the abrupt truncation of the fourier sum . in order to avoid or at least to reduce the gibbs phenomenon ,",
    "smoothing procedures are used that attenuate the higher order coefficients @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the lanczos smoothing factors , introduced in the potential separable expansion ( pse ) method @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) , in constructing the basis set representations of the potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the notations , recall the generalized parabolic coordinates definition and express a formal solution for the three - body coulomb problem in the form of the lippmann - schwinger - type equation . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly outline the parabolic sturmians approach .",
    "in particular , we present the matrix representation of the three - body coulomb green function and consider the potential operator approximation . in sec .  iv calculations of the continuum state of the @xmath7 system , where both electrons recede from the residual ion in opposite directions with equal energies , are described .",
    "our aim is to study the rate of convergence as the basis set used to describe the potential operator is enlarged .",
    "if the same number of basis functions for each parabolic coordinate is used , the problem of numerical solution rapidly gets out of hand .",
    "thus , in the separable expansion of the potential , the number of basis functions for the three chosen curvilinear parabolic coordinates @xmath8 is increased , whereas a single basis function is taken for each of the remaining three coordinates @xmath9 .",
    "the calculations show that the convergence on a basis of reasonable size can be obtained by using the lanczos smoothing factors .",
    "v contains a brief discussion of the overall results .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .",
