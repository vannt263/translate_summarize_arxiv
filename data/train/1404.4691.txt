    "within the standard model , the short - distance contribution to @xmath14-@xmath13 oscillations is highly suppressed by the gim mechanism  @xcite and by the magnitude of the ckm matrix elements  @xcite involved .",
    "however , long distance effects , which can not be reliably calculated , will also affect the size of mixing .",
    "studies of @xmath14-@xmath13 oscillation provide knowledge of the size of these long - distance effects and , given improved calculations , can contribute to searches for new physics  @xcite .",
    "in addition , improved constraints on charm mixing are important for studies of @xmath6 violation ( @xmath15 ) in charm physics .",
    "charm mixing is described by two dimensionless parameters @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the masses and widths of the two mass eigenstates in the @xmath12-@xmath19 system .",

    "these analyses are sensitive to @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite , where @xmath23 is the strong phase difference between the doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) amplitude for @xmath24 and the corresponding cabibbo - favored ( cf ) amplitude for @xmath25 .",

    "@xmath14 and @xmath13 are in a @xmath34-odd quantum - coherent state where the two mesons necessarily have opposite @xmath6 eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "thus , threshold production provides a unique way to identify the @xmath6 of one neutral @xmath35 by probing the decay of the partner @xmath35 .",
