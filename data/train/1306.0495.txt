    "the science of quantum information has attracted tremendous interest over the last twenty years after it was realized that certain computational tasks might be solvable more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical computer @xcite .",
    "for example , a quantum algorithm exists that can factorize a large integer in a time polynomial in the number of digits , whereas no such classical algorithm is known @xcite .",
    "other examples of quantum speed - up include algorithms for searching an unsorted database @xcite , the hidden subgroup problem @xcite , the approximation of jones polynomials @xcite , or the solution of linear systems of equations @xcite with a recent application to data fitting @xcite .",
    "traditionally , quantum information science was mostly concerned with unitary time evolution , which is appropriate for well isolated quantum systems .",
    "an important step in the development of quantum information theory was the realization that all unitary operations in the exponentially large hilbert space of many qubits can be broken down into elementary unitary operations that act on only one or two qubits at the same time @xcite .",
    "in fact , the combination of a single fixed entangling unitary gate that can be applied on any two qubits and the continuous set of all unitary operations on all single qubits form a `` universal gate set '' , which is at the heart of the circuit paradigm of quantum computing @xcite .",
    "however , in reality no quantum system is perfectly isolated from its environment . at the very least ,",
    "the need of state - preparation and the read - out of the results require interaction with the external world .",
    "interactions with the environment lead typically to decoherence and destroy the quantum effects such as interference @xcite and entanglement which are vital for the quantum computational speed - up @xcite . but couplings to the environment can also have beneficial effects .",
    "in particular , it is possible to create entanglement through purely dissipative processes @xcite .",
    "dissipative processes may be used to effectively confine the dynamics to a part of hilbert space where decoherence is strongly reduced ( `` decoherence - free subspaces '' , see @xcite ) and at the same time enable entangling quantum gates in a simple fashion @xcite .",
    "indeed , non - unitary propagation of quantum states opens up a much larger field of operations , and it is desirable to achieve a thorough understanding of the set of these `` quantum channels '' , defined quite generally as linear , completely positive trace preserving maps of a density matrix @xcite .",
    "quantum channels have also played an important role in terms of error models and for the development of quantum error correction @xcite .    given the importance of universal unitary gate sets for unitary quantum computation",
    ", one might expect that simple universal sets of quantum channels might become equally important for exploring the full power of the most general quantum operations allowed by nature .",
    "however , the set of quantum channels is much larger and has more complicated geometry than the set of unitary operations @xcite .",
    "important early work , long before the rise of quantum information theory , has provided us with powerful tools that allow us to assess the crucial complete positivity of a channel , such as the kraus decomposition @xcite , the choi matrix @xcite , or the lindblad form of markovian equations of motion @xcite .",
    "but the full understanding of completely positive maps , especially with respect to composition , remains a formidable mathematical problem .    here",
    "we will restrict ourselves largely to single qubit channels .",
    "ruskai and co - workers @xcite , and wolf and cirac @xcite have made important contributions which we will heavily use .",
    "fujiwara and algoet provided simple inequalities that characterize the set of all unital qubit channels , i.e.  qubit channels that map the identity matrix on itself @xcite .",
    "we provide a compact generalization of these conditions to the general non - unital case where the bloch sphere is mapped to an ellipsoid contained in the bloch sphere .",
    "these new conditions have more natural geometric interpretation than ( equivalent ) conditions presented in @xcite and allow us to classify qubit channels in terms of their pure output ( po ) .",
    "we show in particular that a po in the form of a circle of non - zero radius on the bloch sphere is forbidden by the requirement of complete positivity . for unital qubit channels",
    "we derive a universal set of qubit channels in the sense that all unital qubit channels can be obtained by concatenation of channels from the universal set .",
    "furthermore , we provide a set of universal channels for extremal ( but not necessarily unital ) qubit channels .",
    "since all qubit channels can be obtained by simple convex combination ( i.e.  random classical sampling ) of extremal ones , this essentially solves the problem of a universal channel set for a single qubit .",
    "very recently , a different approach to universal families of qubit quantum channels has been pursued in @xcite .",
    "the authors use universal unitary gates to approximate the unitary appearing in the stinespring dilation of a qubit channel ( realizing the channel as a unitary evolution on a larger space ) .",
    "our approach is more intrinsic , since we do not refer to any dilations of channels .",
    "our universal set contains only single qubit operations , whereas the @xmath0 gate , acting on 2 qubits , is used in @xcite .",
    "however , the mathematical objects used in @xcite are similar to ours : the superoperator matrix @xmath1 and the description of extreme channels , see proposition [ prop : extremal - channels ] .    we begin with the introductory section ii . and iii.a , where we recall well - known facts about qubit channels and their geometry .",
    "in sections iii.b and iii.c we present new results about the minimal set of universal channels for all unital qubit channels . in section",
    "iv.a we derive an alternative necessary and sufficient inequality that characterizes all non - unital qubit channels . in section iv.b we classify all qubit channels by the number of po that they have  . in section v. we present new results on universal sets of channels for all extremal qubit channels .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of complex @xmath3 matrices , and @xmath4 the set of density matrices , that is , positive hermitian @xmath3 matrices with trace one .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the set of pure states ( density matrices of rank one ) , and by @xmath6 the set of all @xmath3 unitary matrices .",
    "a channel @xmath7 is a _ completely positive _ and _ trace preserving _ linear map ; in particular , it maps density matrices to density matrices .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the set of channels acting on a @xmath9-dimensional quantum system .",
    "an important class of channels is the class of unitary channels .",
    "these are linear mappings @xmath10 which map @xmath11 by a unitary conjugation to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . slightly abusing notation ,",
    "we shall write @xmath6 for the set of unitary channels .    it is known that for a @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space ( of , say , @xmath14 qubits , @xmath15 ) , an arbitrary unitary operation can be obtained by concatenation of the controlled - not ( cnot)-gate and the continuous set of all single qubit unitaries @xcite .",
    "our aim is to find a minimal set such that any channel can be realized by iterated application of channels from that minimal set .",
    "more specifically , we have the following definition .",
    "a set of quantum channels @xmath16 is said to be _",
    "universal _ for a set of channels @xmath17 if for all channels @xmath18 there exist channels @xmath19 such that @xmath20    the two subsets @xmath21 that we will investigate are unital qubit channels and extremal qubit channels , to be defined below .",
    "the cnot gate together with single qubit unitaries form a universal set of _ unitary _ quantum channels in the case @xmath22 .    for any set of channels",
    "@xmath23 , we denote by @xmath24 the set of channels generated by @xmath25 concatenations of elements from @xmath23 ( as in ) , and by @xmath26 the set of all channels generated by @xmath23 , with no restriction on the number of concatenations . our aim is to find a set @xmath23 , as small as possible , such that @xmath27 .",
    "from now on we fix @xmath28 and we consider qubit channels @xmath29 .",
    "any state @xmath30 can be expanded in the basis of pauli matrices @xmath31 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the identity matrix in @xmath35 .",
    "normalization of the trace @xmath36 implies @xmath37 .",
    "the components @xmath38 , @xmath39 , form the bloch vector @xmath40 .",
    "pure states have @xmath41 and form the bloch sphere , whereas the set of all other states inside the bloch sphere correspond to mixed states ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "any linear map @xmath29 acting on @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , can be represented by a real @xmath45 matrix @xmath1 that maps the components of @xmath38 to new ones , @xmath46 the most general linear completely positive map of @xmath47 is then given by @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a real @xmath51 matrix , and @xmath52 a vector .",
    "it induces an affine map @xmath53 on the bloch vector .",
    "composition of two channels , @xmath54 , implies @xmath55 in the following we drop the index @xmath56 when it is clear what channel @xmath57 and @xmath50 refer to .",
    "qubit channels can thus be seen as maps acting on bloch vectors thanks to the isomorphism @xmath58 in particular , the channel @xmath59 corresponding to unitary conjugation with @xmath60 is equivalent to a rotation @xmath61 of the bloch vector about axis @xmath62 by an angle @xmath63 .",
    "complete positivity of a qubit channel can be characterized by the positivity of its choi matrix @xmath64 .",
    "choi matrix _ of a channel @xmath56 is defined by @xmath65(|\\mathrm{bell } \\rangle \\langle \\mathrm{bell } |),\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is one of the bell states for two qubits .",
    "alternatively , the choi matrix can be defined by a reshuffling of the indices of the propagator in the computational basis @xcite .",
    "a channel is completely positive , if and only if the choi matrix is non - negative @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of the choi matrix yield , after reshaping them to a matrix and multiplication with the square root of the corresponding eigenvalue , the kraus operators @xmath67 of the channel , defined through @xmath68 .",
    "the minimal number @xmath69 of kraus operators is equal to the number of non - zero eigenvalues of the choi matrix and is called the kraus rank @xcite .      for any matrix @xmath50 , there exist two orthogonal matrices @xmath70 such that the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath50 reads @xmath71 , with @xmath72 a diagonal matrix with non - negative entries .",
    "any orthogonal matrix @xmath73 is such that either @xmath73 or @xmath74 is in @xmath75 ( in the latter case @xmath73 corresponds to an improper rotation , i.e.  a concatenation of a proper rotation with a central inversion ) .",
    "let @xmath76 be a unitary matrix corresponding to @xmath77 via the isomorphism if @xmath78 , or corresponding to @xmath79 otherwise",
    ". then @xmath80 with @xmath81 if both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are in @xmath75 or @xmath84 if exactly one of the @xmath77 is in @xmath75 .",
    "the channel @xmath56 can thus be decomposed into @xmath85 , where @xmath86 are unitary conjugations and @xmath87 a channel whose matrix @xmath88 is diagonal .",
    "we call the diagonal values of @xmath89 the `` signed singular values '' of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "there is of course arbitrariness in the order in which the signed singular values are labeled .",
    "changing the order of the @xmath90 just amounts to changing the order in which the eigenvectors of @xmath50 appear in matrices @xmath91 .",
    "more precisely , for a permutation of three elements , say @xmath92 , we consider the permutation channel @xmath93 defined by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this channel allows to permute the eigenvalues of a matrix @xmath73 .",
    "namely , if @xmath96 , we get @xmath97 . moreover , one can simultaneously change the signs of ( exactly ) two singular values of @xmath72 by concatenating with a unitary channel .",
    "for example , concatenation with @xmath98 changes the signs of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    summarizing , up to unitary rotations",
    ", any qubit channel can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the vector of ( signed ) singular values of the matrix @xmath73 from and @xmath103 are the coordinates ( in the pauli basis ) of @xmath104 . in the next section",
    "we consider the simpler case of unital qubit channels , for which @xmath105 .",
    "we shall turn to non - unital channels in section [ nonunital ] .",
    "unital qubit channels @xmath56 are defined as channels which leave the fully mixed state @xmath106 invariant . in the representation , a channel @xmath56 is unital if and only if @xmath107 . using @xmath108 for @xmath109 with @xmath110 , we obtain the choi matrix in the computational basis for unital qubit channels , @xmath111 using the obvious block - structure of @xmath64 , its eigenvalues @xmath112 are easily computed as @xmath113 according to choi s theorem @xcite , the linear map @xmath56 is completely positive iff its choi matrix @xmath64 is positive , i.e. @xmath114 , @xmath109 .",
    "these four inequalities are exactly equivalent to the celebrated fujiwara - algoet conditions ( fac ) for the complete positivity of a unital qubit channel @xcite , @xmath115 the fac provide four inequalities ; equality in any one of them is equivalent to @xmath116 for some @xmath117 .",
    "note that similar conditions were obtained in @xcite for a particular subclass of non - unital channels , but we shall address this question in section [ sec : generalized - fac ] .    to each channel of the form",
    "one can associate a point in @xmath118 specified by its coordinates @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 be four points in @xmath118 .",
    "point @xmath124 corresponds to the identity channel ; points @xmath125 , @xmath126 , correspond respectively to deterministic bit flip , bit - phase flip , and phase flip @xcite .",
    "the vertices @xmath127 define a regular tetrahedron @xmath128 . rewriting relations - as @xmath129 one can interpret the fac geometrically by saying that the signed singular values @xmath90 of a quantum channel @xmath56 must lie inside the tetrahedron @xmath128 . equality in one of the four inequalities defines a face of @xmath128 .    because of the arbitrariness in the ordering of the @xmath90 mentioned in the previous section , distinct points of @xmath128",
    "can be exchanged with one another via permutation channels .",
    "moreover , rotation by an angle @xmath130 about any of the three coordinate axes @xmath131",
    ", @xmath132 or @xmath133 flips the signs of the two coordinates corresponding to the directions perpendicular to the rotation axis .",
    "starting from the identity channel represented by @xmath124 , concatenations with unitary channels allow to reach the channels @xmath134 represented by points @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the four vertices of @xmath128 are equivalent up to unitary transformations .",
    "note that an  inversion channel  with @xmath135 can not exist , since the corresponding choi matrix is not positive . however , there are channels with all entries negative , e.g.  the one with @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "there is a connection between the kraus rank of a channel @xmath56 , defined in [ sec.quch ] , and the dimension of the boundary on which its representing point lies :    for all _ unital _ qubit channels @xmath56 , the kraus rank of @xmath56 is one plus the dimension of the face of the tetrahedron @xmath128 to which the point @xmath137 belongs .",
    "namely , rank - one channels ( unitary conjugations ) correspond to the vertices of @xmath128 , rank-2 channels correspond to interior of edges , rank-3 channels correspond to interior of faces and full - rank channels to the interior of @xmath128 .",
    "since positivity of the choi matrix is equivalent to complete positivity of the qubit channel , a single vanishing @xmath138 defines a face of the tetrahedron .",
    "two vanishing @xmath138s give the intersection of the corresponding two faces , i.e.  an edge , and three vanishing @xmath138s a vertex .",
    "if no @xmath138 is zero , we have a generic point inside the tetrahedron .",
    "since at the same time the number of non - vanishing @xmath138s is the kraus rank of the channel ( the rank of its choi matrix ) the result holds .    in the following subsections , we investigate the decomposition of qubit channels with given kraus rank .",
    "as mentioned above , all edges of @xmath128 are equivalent up to permutation of the vertices .",
    "therefore we only need to consider one of the edges , e.g.  the edge @xmath139 .",
    "points belonging to this edge correspond to channels @xmath140 given by @xmath141 , @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "these are phase flip channels , where the probability for a phase flip ( conjugation with @xmath143 ) is equal to @xmath144 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the vertex @xmath124 corresponds to the identity channel , whereas the vertex @xmath145 corresponds to a unitary conjugation by the @xmath143 pauli matrix , giving @xmath146 the entire edge represents the set @xmath147\\}$ ] .",

    "since unitary channels are included in our minimal set @xmath23 , it suffices to generate channels corresponding to the half - axis @xmath153 . in the case of phase flip channels",
    ", we have the following technical result .    [ lemtopedge ] for any fixed @xmath148 and a given maximum number @xmath25 of concatenations",
    ", one has @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "concatenation of @xmath25 phase flips , @xmath156 , leads to the @xmath73 matrix @xmath157 .",
    "for any fixed @xmath1 with @xmath158 , the first two entries are equal to @xmath159 when @xmath155 . since this is an increasing function of @xmath1 , for any @xmath160 $ ] there exists a @xmath161 such that @xmath162 .",
    "if one does not place any limit on the number of concatenations , the situation is much simpler : for any @xmath163 , we have @xmath164 together with unitary channels , this set generates all phase flips along the edge @xmath139 , apart from the 1/2-phase flip channel .",
    "in fact , @xmath165 must necessarily be included in the universal channel set , because of the following result .",
    "[ propfp ] for any decomposition @xmath166 , at least one of @xmath167 or @xmath168 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath165 .",
    "let @xmath166 be such a decomposition , and let @xmath169 be the @xmath170 matrices defining the channels @xmath171 .",
    "one has @xmath172 and thus @xmath173 , where @xmath174 denotes the usual operator norm @xmath175 .",
    "since both norms of @xmath169 are smaller than or equal to 1 , it must be that @xmath176 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath177 .",
    "using the fujiwara - algoet conditions , this implies that the signed singular values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are of the form @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively , for some @xmath180 . taking the determinant in eq .",
    ", one gets @xmath181 , so that one of @xmath82 or @xmath83 must be equal to the initial phase flip channel @xmath165 , up to unitary conjugation .",
    "as mentioned , all the edges are obtained by switching the signs of eigenvalues , permuting the eigenvalues , or by combination of the two procedures . this way , we only need to include @xmath182 in our universal set of quantum channels .",
    "we gather the results in this subsection in the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : universal - edge ] the unital qubit channels situated on the edges of the tetrahedron @xmath183 can be obtained by the concatenation of channels from the following _ edge - universal set _ ( @xmath184 is an arbitrarily small positive constant ) : @xmath185      in the seminal paper @xcite , the divisibility of quantum channels was investigated .",
    "a quantum channel @xmath186 was called _ indivisible _ if every possible decomposition of the form @xmath187 is such that one of the @xmath134 is a unitary conjugation .",
    "we recall one of the main results from @xcite .",
    "[ propindv ] a non - unitary qubit quantum channel @xmath188 is indivisible if and only if it has kraus rank 3 .",
    "therefore , _ any _ universal set of qubit channels must include the indivisible channels represented by the faces of the tetrahedron .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath189 the set of all indivisible qubit channels @xmath190    according to proposition [ propindv ] , all channels on the edges of the tetrahedron are divisible . however , divisibility does not guarantee reduction to a more basic set of channels .",
    "for instance , the phase flip channel @xmath165 is divisible in the sense of proposition [ propindv ] , as @xmath191 .",
    "we now state the main result of this section , an @xmath184-small universal set of unital qubit channels .",
    "[ thm : universal - unital - qubit ] for any @xmath163 , the set @xmath192 is a _",

    "let us make now some remarks on the conditions appearing in the theorem above .",
    "first , note that we exclude unital channels ( @xmath222 ) , since in that case the vector @xmath277 is not defined ; one can use the usual fujiwara - algoet conditions in that case . also , note that for any fixed set of @xmath284 , the condition @xmath316 is necessary , but not sufficient .",
    "the set of translation vectors @xmath248 satisfying @xmath316 is composed of a bounded part corresponding to @xmath312 , and an unbounded part with @xmath317 .",
    "the second condition @xmath283 then selects @xmath312 as the one resulting in a completely positive map .",
    "conditions equivalent to were already found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2 ) , in the form of three inequalities .",
    "inequality gives the maximal modulus square of the translation vector @xmath318 of the ellipsoid compatible with positivity of @xmath64 .",
    "this has a very natural geometric interpretation : it gives the maximum displacement of a given ellipsoid in a given direction such that the corresponding linear map is completely positive .",
    "in particular , if one of the @xmath138 is zero ( i.e. , the corresponding channel is represented by a point on a face of the tetrahedron ) , then @xmath319 and the condition implies that one must have @xmath320 .",
    "the implication holds in the opposite direction , namely , if the gfa conditions only allow @xmath320 , then @xmath319 .",
    "thus , one of the @xmath138 vanishes , implying that @xmath321 is a point on the surface of the tetrahedron .",
    "as soon as @xmath321 is within the tetrahedron the right - hand side of the gfa condition ( [ descartes5 ] ) is nonzero and also non - unital channels with such @xmath322s exist .",
    "note also that in the particular case discussed in @xcite , where @xmath323 ( so that , in our notation , @xmath324 and @xmath325 ) , the quantity @xmath326 appearing in the second equation in simplifies to @xmath327 in such a way that is equivalent to the ( generalized ) fac @xmath328      the goal of this subsection is to classify all qubit channels by the number of pure outputs that they can have .",
    "our main result , theorem  [ thm : pure - output - alternative ] , prohibits qubit channels ( apart from unitary conjugations ) that would have more than 2 pure outputs .",
    "we prove the theorem by elementary geometric means , however , note that it follows also from the results presented in  @xcite .",
    "namely , it has been shown  @xcite that extreme or quasi - extreme channels ( i.e. , those from the interior of tetrahedron edges ) that are not unitary conjugations can have at most 2 pure outputs . because every channel can be written as a convex combination of extremal channels , as soon as one of the channels in the convex sum is not a unitary conjugation , at most 2 pure outputs are possible .",
    "if we have a convex combination of unitary conjugations only , then we know that a convex combination of two unitary conjugations is a quasi - extremal channel , again having at most 2 pure outputs , leading to the same conclusion .",
    "the _ pure output _ ( po ) of a quantum channel @xmath56 is the set of pure states in the image of @xmath56 : @xmath329    recall that @xmath330 is the set of density matrices and @xmath331 the set of pure states .",
    "the pure output of a unital channel inherits the central symmetry of the output ellipsoid in the following precise sense :    [ lem : po - symmetry ] the pure output of a unital channel @xmath56 is centrally symmetric , i.e. @xmath332    since both @xmath333 and @xmath334 are centrally symmetric , so is their intersection .    in the following",
