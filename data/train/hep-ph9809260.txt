    "it is now about four years that the non - relativistic qcd approach for the description of phenomena involving quarkonium production and decays , has been introduced  @xcite . without any doubt ,",
    "bodwin , braaten and lepage have provided us with a powerful and rigorous framework where calculations can be undertaken both at perturbative and non - perturbative level . within this approach",
    ", the factorization between short - distance and long - distance physics allows to express physical quantities as inclusive decay widths or cross sections as : @xmath4 where in @xmath5 are encoded the high - energy modes of the theory and so can be calculated perturbatively in qcd , while the matrix elements ( mes ) are non - perturbative and can be either obtained by lattice simulation  @xcite or by comparison with experimental data .",
    "moreover , by means of the power counting rules of nrqcd , it is possible to organize the mes in a hierarchy based on the relative velocity @xmath6 of the heavy - quarks in the bound state . in the end",
    "one is able to organize all these terms in a double expansion in @xmath7 and in @xmath8 and to make predictions , in principle , at any given order of accuracy .",
    "with nrqcd in hands , much of the effort of the last years ( for very nice reviews on more recent developments see for example @xcite ) has been devoted mainly to improve at nlo in @xmath7 the determination of the short distance coefficient @xmath5 for the most relevant terms in the @xmath8 expansion and use the data available on quarkonium production and decays to extract information on the non - perturbative mes .",
    "the aim of the game has been to check the cornerstone of the predictive power of the theory : the mes should be insensitive to the details of the hard processes and depend in a universal way only on the bound state physics .",
    "this allows , in principle , to extract the values of the non - perturbative parameters from the experimental data on one process and then to use them to make predictions for others .    in the following sections i will discuss the necessity of including the colour octet contributions at nlo to correctly predict and/or explain experimental data for two cases of interest",
    "a consistent description of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath9 decay requires the inclusion of the fragmentation components within the nrqcd factorization approach@xcite .",
    "the differential photon decay can be expressed in terms of a convolution between partonic kernels @xmath10 and the fragmentation functions @xmath11 : & & = c_(z ) + + & & _ a= q , q , g_z^1 c_a(x , ) d_a ( , ) where @xmath12 is the rescaled energy of the photon (  @xmath13 is the heavy quark mass  ) .",
    "the first term corresponds to what is usually called the ` prompt ' or direct photon production where the photon is produced directly in the hard interaction while the second one corresponds to the long distance fragmentation process where one of the partons fragments and transfers a fraction of its momentum to the photon .",
    "the nrqcd expansion for the coefficients @xmath14 reads : c_i&= & _ c_i[]((m_q ) ) , [ cexpt ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16(x,\\as(m_q),)$ ] are the perturbative coefficients .",
    "the nrqcd sum is performed over all the relevant @xmath17 states that contribute at a desired order @xmath8 .",
    "the perturbative coefficients for the colour octet states are now known at nlo  @xcite .",
    "we can then investigate the phenomenological applications of colour octet states , if information on the nrqcd mes can be obtained .",
    "to this aim we proceed in two steps : first we obtain estimates by solving the renormalization group ( rg ) equations  @xcite and then we test the reliability of these estimates analyzing their impact on the observable @xmath18 , whose value is well - known both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically at nlo ( both for singlet and octet contributions",
    "@xcite ) . as a result",
    "the rg estimates turn out to be smaller that one could expect form the nave velocity scaling rules and so legitimate doubts on their reliability arise .",
    "nevertheless the above mentioned analysis shows that on one hand rg estimates are to be thought as lower limit while on the other , consistency between theory and experiment in total decay rates , strongly disfavor much larger colour octet mes .",
    "i remark here that these conclusions strongly rely on our present knowledge of the theoretical expression which is only at nlo .",
    "as a recent calculation shows  @xcite , nnlo corrections can be very large . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot - res2 ] are shown the various contributions to the spectrum . at low values of @xmath19",
    "the fragmentation from octets is of the same order of magnitude of the lo colour singlet one .",
    "contrary to lo expectations in the framework of csm  @xcite , we conclude that the decay of @xmath0 into a photon would not be useful for estimating photon fragmentation functions . for values of @xmath19 near the end - point , breaking of the fixed - order calculation is manifest and the resummation of both short - distance coefficient in @xmath3 and the non - perturbative mes in v , is called for .",
    "finally we notice that the overall effect of octet states is at its minimum in the central region of the spectrum ( exactly where the singlet lo direct contribution dominates ) and so it should be used to make comparison with experimental data .",
    "finally it has to be stressed that relativistic and higher order strong corrections to the singlet should be included to have a consistent theoretical picture at nlo } \\to gg\\gamma$ ] are in progress  @xcite . ] .",
    "in the case of a inclusive b decay into a charmonium state the following factorization formula holds  @xcite : @xmath21+x)\\,\\langle { \\cal o}^h[n]\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ] which is valid up to power corrections of order @xmath22 .",
    "( to this accuracy it is justified to treat the @xmath2 meson as a free @xmath23 quark . )",

    "the terms of interest in the @xmath31 effective weak hamiltonian h_eff = _ q = s , d v_cb^v_cq [ eq : heff ] contain the ` current - current ' operators @xmath32 \\ ,   [ \\bar{b } \\gamma^{\\mu } ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) q ]",

    "the spin - triplet @xmath33-wave charmonium states are produced directly from a @xmath26 pair with the same quantum numbers , i.e. @xmath35 . at order @xmath36 relative to this colour singlet contribution",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that even if the colour octet contributions are suppressed by @xmath36 they must be included because the weak effective hamiltonian favours the production of colour octet @xmath26 pairs .",

    "we use @xmath43 and the determination of @xmath44 from direct @xmath1 production at large transverse momentum in @xmath45 collisions @xcite .",
    "the other two colour octet mes are not yet well determined separately . defining @xmath46 we can reproduce the cleo data @xmath47 , with : @xmath48 where a conservative choice for the errors has been made .",
    "it is interesting to compare the central values in ( [ range ] ) and the upper limits with other determinations of the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "this is summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : compare ] .",
    "the central value in the first line is about a factor 3 larger than the central values obtained in  [ eq : final ] . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite the tevatron extraction is very sensitive to various effects that affect the transverse momentum distribution .",
    "indeed , refs .",
    "@xcite quote smaller values compatible with , or smaller than the central values above .",
    "the total production cross section in fixed target collisions probes @xmath50 ( assuming the validity of nrqcd factorization , which may be controversial ) .",
    "given that a different combination of mes enters , the values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are certainly consistent with the above central value .",
    "considering the uncertainties involved in charmonium production in hadron collisions , the above upper limit on @xmath51 is the most stringent one existing at present .",
    "we have shown , by discussing both a decay and a production process , that the effects of including colour octet states contributions are relevant . in particular",
    "we have given examples on how information on non - perturbative mes can be obtained by the comparison between theoretical quantities ( where short distance coefficients have been calculated at nlo ) and available experimental data .",
    "this procedure has allowed us ( a ) to make predictions for photon energy spectrum in the @xmath0 decays gaining information from the total and leptonic decay rates ; ( b ) to give an estimate for some of colour octet mes relevant for the @xmath1 production in b decays and so to check the `` universality '' by comparison with the values extracted from other processes . as a final comment",
    "i would like to note that in both the above analysis we have found values of the mes _ smaller _ than one could expect from the na \" i ve power counting of nrqcd . whether this is a general feature of nlo calculations ( as a preliminary analysis for fixed - target hadroproduction and photoproduction indeed shows ) and",
    "how this can be reconciled with the scaling rules is under study .",
