    "the group - theoretic methods are a modern mathematical apparatus widely used to investigation of different mathematical models based both on the ordinary and partial differential equations .",
    "the sources of the group analysis of differential equations are found in the fundamental papers of sophus lie @xcite .",
    "however , only after the classical works of g. birkhoff @xcite and l.v .",
    "ovsiannikov @xcite have been published , the group - theoretical methods would have been widely used in applications . to the present day , the symmetry properties of many well - known equations from mechanics , hydrodynamics , quantum physics etc .",
    "have been studied in detail ( see the monographs @xcite and the papers sited therein ) .",
    "this notwithstanding , it should be stressed that only a few papers consider differential equations with initial and boundary conditions .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , first works in this direction were published only at the end of 60 s years of the last century @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , interest to the group - theoretic analysis of bvps have been growing only in the 90 s of the twentieth century ( see the monographs @xcite and the papers sited therein ) . at present",
    ", the generally - accepted view is that a symmetry ( in lie s sense ) of a boundary - value problem must satisfy such three criteria @xcite :    * a symmetry of the governing differential equation ; * a smooth bijective mapping of the domain to itself ; * a mapping of the set of boundary data to itself .    if a differential equation contains as coefficients arbitrary functions ( formally speaking , they can be constants ) then the group classification problem springs up .",
    "such kind of problems was formulated and solved for a class of non - linear heat equations in the pioneering work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . at the present time",
    ", there are algorithms for rigorous solving group classification problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the papers cited therein ) , which were successfully applied to different classes of partial differential equations .",
    "thus , if a governing equation and/or auxiliary ( initial or boundary ) conditions contain as coefficients arbitrary functions then one should formulate and solve the group classification problem for such class of bvps . in this paper",
    "we consider from group - theoretic point of view a class of ( 1 + 1)dimensional nonlinear bvps modeling the processes of heat transfer in the semi - infinity conductive domain occupying the region @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the unknown temperature field , @xmath3 is the nonlinear coefficient of thermal conductivity , @xmath4 is the some known function describing the heat flux of energy absorbing ( or radiating ) at the surface @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the some known temperature at infinity .",
    "additionally , we will assume that all functions arising in problem ( [ 0.1])([0.4 ] ) are sufficiently smooth .",
    "it should be noted that bvps with governing heat conduction equation have a wide field of applications in various branches of science and technology . that is why the problems of this type were a subject of especial attention of researchers throughout the history of development of the heat conduction theory . in the case of linear heat equation ( [ 0.1 ] ) , the problems of the type ( [ 0.1])([0.4 ] ) can be easy solved @xcite . if the equation is nonlinear than an analysis of the problems like ( [ 0.1])([0.4 ] ) is very complicated , and each such a problem requires special investigation .",
    "starting from the classical works of ya.b . zeldovich and g.i .",
    "barenblatt ( see the monograph @xcite ) , the bvps for nonlinear heat conduction have been intensively studied by different both exact and approximate methods ( see @xcite and the paper sited therein ) . however , to the beast of our knowledge , there are a few papers dealing with group - theoretic investigation of problems for nonlinear heat equation and its generalizations @xcite , but class ( [ 0.1])([0.4 ] ) has not yet been the subject of study by researchers working in the field of symmetry analysis of differential equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we formulate a definition of invariance in lie s sense for a wide class of bvps . the problem of group classification in classes of bvps parameterized by arbitrary elements is studied and an algorithm for its solution is also formulated . in section 3 ,",
    "we perform the complete group classification of the class of bvps ( [ 0.1])([0.4 ] ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we carry out the reduction of the bvp in question in the special case when @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 to a bvp of lower dimensionality , and an example of its exact solution is constructed . finally , we present some conclusions in the last section .",
    "let us consider a bvp of @xmath10th  order ( @xmath11 ) for a system of @xmath12 evolution equations with @xmath13 independent @xmath14 ( hereafter @xmath15 ) and @xmath12 dependent @xmath16 variables .",
