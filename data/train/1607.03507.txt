    "<S> , we discuss some interesting features related to the motion of particles near myers - perry black hole with arbitrary extra dimensions as well as single non - zero spin parameter . assuming it as a supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy , we calculate red - blue shifts in the equatorial plane for the far away observer as well as corresponding black hole parameters of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the penrose process and find that the energy gain of particle depends on the variation of black hole dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the center of mass energy for eleven dimensions which indicates similar behavior as that of four dimensions but it is higher in four dimensions than five or more dimensions . we conclude that higher dimensions have a great impact on the particle dynamics .    * </S>",
