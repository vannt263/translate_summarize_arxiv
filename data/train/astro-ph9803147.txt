    "one of the main uncertainties is the co to h@xmath2 conversion factor .",
    "wilson ( 1995 ) and arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto ( 1996 ) have found an empirical relationship indicating an increase in the co to h@xmath2 conversion factor with decreasing metallicity .",
    "however , detailed studies of the molecular clouds in the lmc and smc suggest other factors , besides metallicity , have an important role on the co to h@xmath2 conversion factor ( rubio 1997 ; israel 1997 ) .",
    "although significant questions remain in our understanding of the co to h@xmath2 factor , the molecular chemistry that occurs in metal ",
    "deficient galaxies is even more uncertain .",
    "molecular chemistry calculations are quite complicated and typically involve networks of hundreds to several thousand reactions ( graedel , langer , & frerking 1982 ; herbst & leung 1989 [ hl89 ] ; langer & graedel 1989 [ lg89 ] ; bergin , langer , & goldsmith 1995 [ blg95 ] ) . since the chemistry models still have difficulties in explaining several of the observed abundance ratios in galactic molecular clouds , very little modeling has been devoted to metal  poor galaxies .",
    "one notable exception is the theoretical study of the chemistry in lmc and smc molecular clouds by millar & herbst ( 1990 ) [ mh90 ] . in general ,",
    "the molecular chemistry models are sensitive to a variety of parameters , such as the density , temperature , and ionization field , but the dominant parameter for determining the relative molecular abundances of the carbon and oxygen species is the carbon to oxygen ratio ( lg89 ) .",
    "the models predict that the o@xmath2/co ratio decreases exponentially with increases in the c / o ratio ( lg89 ) .",
    "this could have interesting ramifications on the molecular abundances in chemically young galaxies .",
    "observations with the hubble space telescope have shown that the c / o abundance ratio increases with increasing metallicity in hii galaxies ( garnett et al .",
    "therefore , we could expect to find lower c / o ratios and correspondingly larger o@xmath2/co ratios within dark molecular clouds in chemically young galaxies .",
    "based on these simple ideas , the evolution of the o@xmath2/co abundance ratio as a function of metallicity in galaxies has been recently quantified for a variety of conditions and parameters governing the imf and star formation histories ( frayer & brown 1997 [ fb97 ] ) . at low metallicities , fb97",

    "molecular oxygen has yet to be detected conclusively outside our solar system . due to atmospheric attenuation ,",

    "all of these previous searches for o@xmath2 have concentrated on chemically rich systems , or molecular clouds of unknown metallicity .",

    "deficient galaxies .    from the literature",
    ", we have compiled a list of metal  poor ( @xmath17 ) iras galaxies with redshifts of @xmath18 .",
    "there are only about 20 galaxies satisfying these constraints , which were primarily drawn from the samples of salzer & macalpine ( 1988 ) and dultzin  hacyan , masegosa , & moles ( 1990 ) .",
    "unfortunately , most of these galaxies are relatively weak iras sources @xmath19  jy , and none have reported co detections .",
    "this is not terribly surprising since metal  deficient galaxies have lower amounts of dust .",
    "the metallicities for the galaxies in our sample were derived from their oxygen abundances calculated using standard hii region analysis techniques whenever the 4363[oiii ] line was observed ( osterbrock 1989 , case b ) . for galaxies with no 4363line , the techniques of mcgaugh ( 1991 )",
    "were used to estimate the oxygen abundance . in this initial study",
    ", we observed the strongest iras sources satisfying the metallicity and redshift constraints .",
    "in april 1996 we observed five of the strongest iras galaxies which are known to be metal deficient and are at redshifts @xmath18 with the nrao 12 m telescope .",
    "the redshift constraint was required to permit the observations of the ground state transition of @xmath20 n , j@xmath21 at a rest frequency of 118.7503 ghz .",
    "for all five of the galaxies , we first searched for @xmath0co(1@xmath10 ) line emission .    with the 12 m telescope system",
    ", we used dual polarization sis mixer receivers tuned to the frequency of the redshifted lines .",
    "the spectra were formed as total power differences between the source and a reference position 4@xmath22 away in azimuth using a nutating subreflector to switch at a rate of 1.25 hz .",
    "each polarization was recorded using a @xmath23 mhz filter bank spectrometer .",
    "the frequency setups were checked with observations of lines in orion - kl and sag  b2 ( turner 1989 ) .",
    "pointing was checked every 24 hours and was found to be accurate to within @xmath24 . based on observations of mars",
    ", we derived a conversion factor of @xmath25 jy / k for the @xmath26 temperature scale .",
    "this conversion factor assumes that the source is smaller than the @xmath27 beam , which is valid for our sample of galaxies .",
    "table  1 shows the co(1@xmath10 ) results of the 12 m observations .",
    "we detected co(1@xmath10 ) emission only in mrk  109 .",

    "this feature was seen in both polarizations and in different subsets of the data .",
    "interestingly , at the distance of mrk  109 the o@xmath29 line is redshifted to 115.22 ghz , which is very near the co(1@xmath10 ) rest frequency",
    ". however , the broad line  width ( @xmath30 ) rules out galactic clouds as a possible origin of the 115.22 ghz feature , and there are no known low  redshift galaxies within or near the beam of the 12 m observations .",
    "the velocity agreement for both features is encouraging ( fig . 1 ) and is consistent with both lines being associated with mrk  109 .",
    "although 12 hours of source integration time were invested for each of these lines , the co(1@xmath10 ) and o@xmath29 lines could only be considered tentatively detected with the 12 m data .",
    "follow  up",
    "observations with more sensitive telescopes were required to confirm the presence of these lines .",
    "in july 1997 we obtained follow  up observations of mrk  109 with the iram 30 m telescope . with the 30 m telescope system ,",
    "we simultaneously observed the redshifted co(1@xmath10 ) and o@xmath29 lines .",
    "each line was observed using a @xmath31 mhz filter bank detector .",
    "the pointing of the telescope was checked every 2 hours with observations of 0923 + 392 and was found to have an accuracy of better than @xmath32 .",
    "the frequency setup of the observations was confirmed by test observations of irc+10216 . in three evenings we collected 6.3 hours of integration time on mrk  109 . based on measurements of mars taken each day , we derived a conversion factor of @xmath33 jy / k for the observed @xmath34 temperature scale .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectra for the redshifted co(1@xmath10 ) and o@xmath29 lines .",
    "the co(1@xmath10 ) line was clearly detected , while the o@xmath29 line was not . since the optical size of mrk  109 is less than the 30 m beam size of @xmath35",
    ", we conclude that the 115.22 ghz feature apparent in the 12 m data does not arise from mrk  109 .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that this feature is associated with molecular gas outside the beam of the 30 m , but within the 12 m beam .",
    "one possibility , albeit improbable , is that the 12 m feature is due to co(1@xmath10 ) emission from a previously undetected galaxy at @xmath36 .",
    "most likely the 115.22 ghz feature seen in the 12 m data is spurious .",
    "based on the 30 m data , we measure an integrated co(1@xmath10 ) line strength of @xmath37 over @xmath38 for mrk  109 , which is 10 times larger than the integrated rms noise across the profile .",
    "the uncertainty in this measurement is dominated by the absolute flux calibration uncertainty of 18% . the @xmath16 upper limit to the o@xmath29 line strength is @xmath39 .",
    "we discuss the significance of this upper limit in  [ sec - o2co ] .      in january 1997",
    ", we obtained co(1@xmath10 ) and o@xmath29 imaging observations of mrk  109 with the six element owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) array .",
    "the co(1@xmath10 ) line was observed in the lower side  band , while the o@xmath29 line was observed simultaneously in the upper side  band .",
    "each line was observed using a @xmath40  mhz digital correlator spectrometer centered on the redshifted frequencies of the lines .",
    "the phase center of the interferometric observations was the optical position of @xmath41(b1950 ) = @xmath42 ; @xmath43(b1950 ) = @xmath44 .",
    "these observations were carried out in a low resolution configuration ( baselines ranging from 15115 m ) , which provided a resolution of @xmath45 using natural weighting .",
    "we obtained 20 hours of effective integration time on mrk  109 spread over 4 separate nights .",
    "observations of 3c  273 were used for passband and flux calibration .",
    "the observations of the nearby radio source 0923 + 392 were made every 20 minutes for gain calibration .",
    "the data were calibrated using the ovro mma software package , and the data analysis was accomplished using the nrao aips software package .",
    "figure  3 shows a natural  weighted map of the co(1@xmath10 ) emission in mrk  109 averaged over the velocity range showing co emission in the 30 m data .",
    "the co(1@xmath10 ) emission was unresolved and is spatially and kinematically consistent with the optical regions in mrk  109 ( mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) .",
    "we measure an integrated co(1@xmath10 ) line strength of @xmath46 from the ovro data which is consistent within uncertainties with the single  dish measurements .",
    "the line was detected at the @xmath47 level in the ovro data , and a major contributor to the uncertainty of the co line flux comes from the 20% flux calibration uncertainty .",
    "figure  4 shows the co(1@xmath10 ) and o@xmath29 spectra taken along the velocity axis of the data cubes at the peak position in the integrated co map .",
    "the ovro co(1@xmath10 ) line profile is very similar to that of the 30 m .",
    "we find no evidence of a o@xmath2 line in mrk  109 from the ovro data .",
    "no other features , besides co(1@xmath10 ) emission at the position of mrk  109 , were detected in the ovro data cubes .",
    "in this paper we report the detection of co(1@xmath10 ) emission in mrk  109 as well as the nondetection of co in four distant metal  deficient galaxies ( table  1 ) .",
    "we estimate the amount of molecular gas implied by these observations using the metallicity dependent relationship derived empirically by wilson ( 1995 ) .",
    "wilson finds that the co to h@xmath2 conversion factor increases with decreasing metallicity as a @xmath48 power law .",
    "we adopt this power law and calculate the molecular gas mass ( including he ) using @xmath49 where s@xmath50 is the co flux in @xmath51(wilson 1995 ) .",
    "this relationship is consistent with simple theoretical arguments . in the low metallicity limit",
    "in which the co emission becomes optically thin , we would expect the conversion factor to increase roughly linearly with decreasing metallicity ( sakamoto 1996 ) .",
    "as the metallicity reaches the solar value , the co emission becomes optically thick , and the conversion factor becomes independent of metallicity , ignoring other physical parameters . for global observations of metal  deficient galaxies , we could expect a mixture of co optical depths and an effective power law for the conversion factor between 0 and @xmath52 .",
    "the s(co)/s(100@xmath53 ) ratio for this sample of galaxies is significantly smaller than that for normal elliptical and spiral galaxies . by using the co to iras flux correlation derived for normal galaxies ( bregman , hogg , & roberts 1992 )",
    ", we would expect co(1@xmath10 ) fluxes of @xmath54 , which are much larger than those found for these galaxies .",
    "this is not a new observational result for metal  deficient galaxies ( e.g. , sage et al . 1992 ) .",
    "metallicity by itself , however , does not appear to explain this discrepancy .",
    "assuming an intrinsic gas to dust ratio which increases linearly with decreasing metallicity ( issa , maclaren , & wolfendale 1990 ) and using the metallicity  corrected co to h@xmath2 conversion factor ( as in eq.[1 ] ) , we would expect the s(co)/s(100@xmath53 ) ratio to vary with @xmath55 .",
    "this dependence is much weaker than that which is observed .",
    "clearly , more work is needed before we can gain a complete understanding of the low s(co)/s(100@xmath53 ) ratios in metal  deficient galaxies . for the remaining of the paper ,",
    "we focus on mrk  109 .",
    "the galaxy mrk  109 is one of the more luminous metal ",
    "deficient starburst galaxies .",
    "it has an absolute magnitude of @xmath56 which places it apart from the more typical low  luminosity metal  poor dwarf galaxies with @xmath57 ( french 1980 ) .",
    "mrk  109 appears to be interacting with a nearby companion located approximately @xmath24 west of mrk  109 . both mrk  109 and its companion are spectroscopically classified as hii galaxies and are separated by only @xmath28 in radial velocity ( mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the velocities of the optical knots in mrk  109 ( labeled a , b , c , & d ) and that of the companion galaxy ( labeled a ) .",
    "the co emission spans the full range of velocities given by the optical components , which is consistent with the interaction between mrk  109 and the companion galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the co(1@xmath10 ) profile peaks at the velocity of the companion galaxy , while the co emission is spatially consistent with the brightest central optical knot ( b ) in mrk  109 . the interpretation of these results is not clear . it is possible that the kinematic center of mrk  109 is offset from the brightest optical region and",
    "is more consistent with the average velocity of knots ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "alternatively , the bulk of the gas observed may have been stripped from the companion galaxy ( a ) .",
    "unfortunately , we lack the sensitivity and resolution to provide a detailed kinematic study of the molecular gas in this system .",
    "however , we can deduce general characteristics such as the star  formation efficiency ( sfe ) and the gas fraction for this merger / starburst system .    based on the 30 m data ,",
    "we derive a molecular gas mass of @xmath58 for mrk  109 , using equation  ( 1 ) where @xmath59 .",
    "this is a relatively large amount of molecular gas for a metal  deficient galaxy and is similar to the total amount of molecular gas estimated for the milky way ( @xmath60 , solomon & rivolo 1987 ) .",
    "the dynamical mass contained within the co emission regions is @xmath61)^2/g $ ] , where @xmath62 is the observed fwzi line width of @xmath63 .",
    "the resolution of the ovro data places an upper limit on the size of the co emission region of @xmath64 .",
    "the inclination of mrk  109 is unknown .",
    "assuming an intrinsic axial ratio of one , the observed optical axial ratio ( mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) implies an inclination of @xmath65 . using the above numbers , we calculate a dynamical mass of @xmath66 .",
    "these results suggest a gas fraction of approximately unity within the central regions of mrk  109 .",
    "granted , given the uncertainties in the co to h@xmath2 conversion factor and inclination , the gas fraction may be lower . if we , nevertheless , take these results at face value , the large calculated gas fraction is consistent with a young starburst , where the majority of the gas has yet to be consumed by the ongoing star formation .    by using the h@xmath41 line luminosity of mrk  109 ( mazzarella , bothun , & boroson 1991 )",
    ", we estimate a total star  formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath67 ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the sfr expected from its far infrared luminosity , assuming the relationship given by sage et al .",
    "in addition , the derived sfr is also consistent with the upper limit implied from the radio data .",
    "mrk  109 has not been detected at cm wavelengths .",
    "the data from the nrao vla sky survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) implies a flux density of less than 1  mjy ( @xmath68 ) at 1.4  ghz . using this value we derive an upper limit to the total sfr of approximately @xmath69 , assuming non  thermal radio emission from supernovae remnants and renormalizing the formulae of condon ( 1992 ) to match the imf of kennicutt ( 1983 ) .",
    "the consistency of the radio , infrared , and optical data indicates that the sfr has not been seriously underestimated due to high  extinction regions that are hidden at optical wavelengths .    the star ",
    "formation efficiency can be defined as the the ratio of the sfr to the amount of molecular gas . for mrk  109",
    ", we find an implied efficiency of only sfe@xmath70 gyr@xmath71 , which is an order of magnitude lower than that typically found for starburst galaxies ( sage et al .",
    "1992 ) . assuming a constant sfr",
    ", this would translate into a gas depletion time scale of 2  gyr for mrk  109 .",
    "the sfr , sfe , and gas depletion time scale of mrk  109 are , hence , more similar to those found for normal spiral galaxies than starburst systems . at first glance",
    ", these results could appear contradictory with a merger scenario where we expect to typically find high sfrs ( e.g. , mihos , richstone , & bothun 1992 ) .",
    "however , most previously studied merger systems are older metal  rich , iras luminous starbursts ( e.g. , sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ) .",
    "mrk  109 is a low metallicity system whose ism has undergone significantly less processing .",
    "it is possible that mrk  109 is a young interacting system still in the process of gaseous infall into the central starburst region which could explain its current low sfe .",
    "the major goal of this study is to constrain the o@xmath2/co abundance ratio for chemically young systems .",
    "previous searches for o@xmath2 emission have been directed toward co bright sources , such as nearby giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) cores or the centers of bright iras galaxies (  1 ) . in this paper , we present the first o@xmath2/co abundance limit for a metal  deficient galaxy .    the observed intensity limit for the o@xmath29 line in mrk  109 is @xmath72 (  2.2 ) . by combining equation  ( 1 ) with the expression given by liszt ( 1992 ) , we can relate the observed intensity ratio to a column density abundance ratio with the following expression ( fb97 ) : @xmath73 the @xmath74 ratio is the column density abundance ratio averaged over the telescope beam .",
    "it is related to the intrinsic o@xmath2/co abundance ratio by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the ratio of the filling factors of the o@xmath2 and co emission regions within the telescope beam .",
    "if the co and o@xmath2 emission regions are coextensive , then @xmath77 .",
    "although this has been assumed for all previous o@xmath2 studies , it may not be valid .",
    "for now we adopt @xmath77 and discuss the applicability of this assumption later .    by adopting @xmath78  k and using equation  ( 2 )",
    ", we calculate @xmath79 ( @xmath16 ) for mrk  109 . to determine the significance of this upper limit",

    "figure  5 compares the observational upper limits of the o@xmath2/co ratio with theoretical expectations as a function of the o / c ratio .",
    "we first summarize the data displayed in figure  5 , and then we discuss several implications of the data .    the analytical fits in figure  5 were made to the steady  state and early  time solutions of lg89 and mh90 ( fb97 ) .",
    "the steady  state solutions represent the equilibrium values achieved in the chemistry models after @xmath80 , while the early  time solutions are for @xmath81 .",
    "the lg89 solutions are for galactic clouds , and the mh90 solutions are for clouds in the lmc and smc .",

    "most of the previous searches for o@xmath2 have been made for regions of unknown o / c abundance ratios and uncertain metallicities , and the previous comparisons between the observational limits of the o@xmath2/co ratio and the theoretical calculations generally assume a solar o / c abundance ratio . since the o@xmath2/co ratio is strongly nonlinear with the o / c ratio near solar metallicities , accurate estimates of the o / c ratio",

    "the observations of mrk  109 provide us with the first probe of a metal  deficient system .",
    "the o@xmath2/co upper limit for mrk  109 is lower than the expected steady  state solutions ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "as stated earlier , the theoretical solutions were derived assuming dark molecular clouds .",
    "since the photodissociation rate for o@xmath2 is larger than that for co ( van dishoeck 1988 ) , the global averaged o@xmath2/co abundance ratios could be significantly lower than the dark cloud solutions ( fb97 ) .",
    "therefore , at low metallicities we have two competing tendencies affecting the global o@xmath2/co ratio . on one hand , the production of o@xmath2 is enhanced due to the higher o / c ratios , but on the other hand the o@xmath2 molecules are more susceptible to photodissociation . the effect that photodissociation has on the global o@xmath2/co abundance ratio depends on the fraction of the molecular gas residing in dark clouds .",
    "significant o@xmath2 emission is only expected from regions with @xmath97 , while co emission can arise from regions with lower values of extinction ( fb97 ) .",
    "since the co emission is thought to be more pervasive than the o@xmath2 emission , we would expect relative filling factors of @xmath98 for extragalactic observations of a collection of clouds .",
    "hence , the standard assumption of @xmath99 is not valid in general . assuming spherical molecular clouds",
    ", we estimate that @xmath100 based on the work of fb97 .",
    "if we use the steady  state theoretical solutions , we would expect o@xmath2/co @xmath101 for the dark cloud regions ( @xmath102 ) in mrk  109 .",
    "the @xmath16 upper limit on the @xmath74 ratio for mrk  109 would then suggest @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in summary , either most of the molecular gas does not reside in dark clouds in mrk  109 , or the steady  state solutions do not apply for mrk  109 .    by using the models of fb97 which assume the size  density relationship and the gmc mass function found for galactic clouds",
    ", we estimate @xmath105 for regions with a metallicity similar to that of mrk  109 . this value is calculated from the ratio of the volume  weighted mass fractions of molecular hydrogen traced by the o@xmath2 and co molecules ; @xmath106^{{{\\rm o}_2}}/m[{{\\rm h}_2}]^{{\\rm co}})^{2/3}$ ] ( fb97 ) .",
    "arguably , molecular clouds at low metallicities may be comprised of higher density clumps than those found for galactic gmcs , given the studies of the lmc and smc ( lequeux et al .",
    "in such a case , the above value for the @xmath76 ratio should be thought of as a lower limit .",
    "the likely value of @xmath76 for mrk  109 is , therefore , @xmath107 . in this context , the observational o@xmath2/co limit for mrk  109 is not that restrictive on the models of molecular gas  phase chemistry in dark clouds .",
    "both the steady  state and early  time solutions are possible for values of @xmath108 .",
    "in this paper , we report the nondetection of co(1@xmath10 ) emission in four distant metal  deficient galaxies and the detection of co emission in mrk  109 .",
    "the co(1@xmath10 ) observations of mrk  109 imply the presence of @xmath109 of molecular gas within the central few kpc of mrk  109 .",
    "the observational data favor a recent interaction of mrk  109 with a nearby companion which has induced a starburst in the central regions of mrk  109 .",
    "the low metallicity , high gas fraction , and the kinematics are consistent with a young starburst .    based on the competing photodissociation and chemistry effects",
    ", we expect the largest global o@xmath2/co ratios for systems with metallicities in the range of @xmath110 ( fb97 ) .",
    "although the metallicity of mrk  109 falls within this optimal range , we fail to detect o@xmath2 emission in mrk  109 .",
    "the observed intensity upper limit is @xmath39 .",
    "these observations provide the first constraint on the abundance of o@xmath2 in a metal  deficient galaxy .",
    "we derive a column density abundance limit of @xmath111 for mrk  109 .",
    "these results suggest that most of the molecular gas in mrk  109 does not reside in dark clouds , and/or that the gas  phase steady  state chemistry models do not apply for mrk  109 .",
    "it would be challenging to significantly improve the o@xmath2/co limit for chemically young environments derived from this work with current ground  based instrumentation .",
    "future observations with satellites , such as odin ( hjalmarson 1997 ) , of the lmc and smc should provide more useful limits .",
