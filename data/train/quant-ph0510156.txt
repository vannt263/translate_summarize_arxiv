    "quantum states are described by vectors in a hilbert space @xcite , or wave functions @xcite , in the case of pure states . in the case of mixed states , the density operators @xcite",
    "are used instead to describe quantum states . on the other hand ,",
    "different other tools have been introduced to describe quantum states by means of functions on phase space .",
    "these functions , like wigner function @xcite , husimi - kano q - quasidistribution @xcite , sudarshan - glauber diagonal ( singular ) p - quasidistribution @xcite , contain informations about the quantum state which amount to the informations carried by the density matrix in an arbitrary representation .",
    "in fact , these different quasidistributions are alternative , essentially equivalent forms of representing the density operators .",
    "these quasidistributions have some properties similar to those of classical probability distributions on phase space , but they are not fair joint probability distributions since the uncertainty relation of position and momentum is incompatible with the existence of such probability density .",
    "recently a tomographic approach to reconstruct wigner functions from optical tomograms was suggested @xcite .",
    "the optical tomography approach was generalized to provide symplectic tomography @xcite . in the tomographic approach",
    "the quantum state is associated to a probability distribution depending on some extra parameters .",
    "this observation was used to develop a probability representation of quantum mechanics in which the tomographic probability distribution ( tomogram ) is considered as the primary object obeying an evolution equation of generalized fokker - planck type @xcite and containing all informations on quantum state . thus it is possible to formulate quantum mechanics by describing a quantum state by fair probability distribution instead of wave functions or density matrices . by reading this chain of associations backwards , it is quite natural to ask if it is possible to provide an interpretation of tomograms directly at the level of the abstract hilbert space . in particular this interpretation should work equally well for finite level systems ( spin tomography ) and generic systems .",
    "the interpretation can make obvious the mechanism of description of quantum states by fair probabilities instead of wave functions and density matrices .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to show how to provide such an interpretation without , however , indulging on more technical aspects ( these will be considered elsewhere ) .",
    "the main idea consists of expressing the tomogram in terms of a scalar product in the space @xmath0 of rank - one projectors , that is in the linear space of operators acting on the space of quantum states .",
    "these projectors are connected with special families of vectors in the hilbert space @xmath1 of quantum states .",
    "the vectors are eigenvectors of families of operators depending on some extra parameters .",
    "we will obtain a decomposition of the identity operator in terms of a weighted sum of the projectors depending on the extra parameter and determining the tomogram , so that any matrix and in particular the density matrix can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of the basis vectors in the space @xmath2 .",
    "this explains why the inversion formula ( reconstruction formula ) works for the tomographic maps .",
    "the tomograms can be constructed also for spin states @xcite .",
    "the relation between tomographic maps and star - product quantization schemes was clarified in ref .",
    "we develop our theory bearing in mind the case of spin tomography",
    ". however , that general picture of tomographic map is applicable to other kinds of tomographies too , e.g. to photon number tomography @xcite and symplectic tomography . to demonstrate the results we review the approach in which an @xmath3matrix is considered as an @xmath4vector , used for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section 2 we review the picture where a matrix is regarded as a vector . in section 3",
    "we define the tomography in abstract finite dimensional hilbert spaces and give new interpretation to the tomograms , both in terms of sets of rank - one projectors and of  families of unitary , or hermitian , operators . in section 4",
    "we discuss in the light of our picture some known examples as the spin tomography for the finite dimensional case , the photon number and the symplectic tomographies for the infinite dimensional case , deriving new identity decompositions in terms of rank - one projectors in hilbert space of bounded hermitian operators .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are discussed in section 5 .",
    "in order to make clear how the tomographic approach provides relations connecting probability distribution with density matrix elements we start with a very elementary example .",
    "we consider two hilbert spaces @xmath1 and @xmath5 for simplicity we first identify the hilbert spaces @xmath6 with the qu - bit ( i.e. spin 1/2 ) quantum state set , i.e. with vectors @xmath7 .\\ ] ] then the density matrix ( density operator ) for this pure state has the form @xmath8 .",
    "\\label{matrix}\\ ] ] it is well known ( e.g. , see @xcite ) that the set of operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath1 is a linear space .",
    "this space is a hilbert space @xmath0 since one has the scalar product of two operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 acting on the space @xmath1 given by the formula @xmath11 we use here the dirac s notation for the scalar product .",
    "in fact , to write an operator ( a matrix ) as a vector , being very simple , is convenient .",
    "thus the matrix of eq.([matrix ] ) can be mapped onto a 4-vector using the rule @xmath12\\ ] ] this rule allows to reconstruct a matrix if the corresponding 4-vector is given . for example , given a 4-vector @xmath13 , one obtains the matrix @xmath9 as : @xmath14 \\longrightarrow \\hat{a}=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } a_{1 } & a_{2 } \\\\",
    "a_{3 } & a_{4 } \\end{array } \\right ]   \\label{vecmatrix}\\ ] ]    of course",
    "other `` reconstructions '' would be possible , and indeed this possibility has been exploited to consider alternative associative products on the vector space of matrices.@xcite    the scalar product of eq.([scal prod ] ) expressed in terms of matrices @xmath15 and @xmath10 is nothing but the standard vector scalar product given by @xmath16 the set of 4-vectors equipped with this scalar product is the hilbert space @xmath17 thus , having an initial hilbert space of vectors @xmath1 of two - dimensional qu - bit , we have also the four - dimensional hilbert space of 4-vectors @xmath18 the linear operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath19 the orthogonal basis in the space @xmath1 of spin up and down states ( standard basis ) @xmath20 ; \\left| e_{2}\\right\\rangle = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] for instance , is complete .",
    "the completeness relation can be given in the form of an equality valid in the hilbert space @xmath18 namely @xmath21 here the orthogonal projectors @xmath22 ; \\hat{p}_{2}=\\left| e_{2}\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle e_{2}\\right| = % \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] satisfying the relation ( [ projecomplet ] ) corresponds to the possibility to decompose each vector of @xmath1 in terms of the basis vector @xmath23 and @xmath24 that is @xmath25 we considered in such details very simple properties of the linear spaces @xmath6 and @xmath0 , because essentially they are the basis of our considerations on the possibility to construct tomographic probabilities and to guarantee the existence of an inversion formula yielding the operator from its tomogram . in general , the completeness relation of a basis @xmath26 of @xmath1 can be represented in the form @xmath27 the rank - one projectors @xmath28 depend on a set of parameters @xmath29 ( discrete or continuous , as well as finite or infinite ) and , being in general non - orthogonal : @xmath30 they form a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the four - dimensional space @xmath0 one has the standard basis @xmath31 , \\left| b_{2}\\right\\rangle = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\left| b_{3}\\right\\rangle = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\left| b_{4}\\right\\rangle = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] so that each vector @xmath13 may be decomposed as @xmath32 this decomposition of the vector @xmath13 corresponds to the decomposition of the matrix @xmath9 of eq.([vecmatrix ] ) in the form @xmath33 = a_{1}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] + a_{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] + a_{3}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] + a_{4}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] with respect to a basis of non - hermitian operators .",
    "however , it is always possible to use a basis of hermitian operators , for instance the unit matrix @xmath34 together with the pauli matrices @xmath35 .",
    "then  : @xmath36 , \\left| \\sigma _ { 1}\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\left| \\sigma _ { 2}\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ -i \\\\ i \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\left| \\sigma _ { 3}\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{array } \\right ] , \\ ] ] so that @xmath37 the relation between old and new components is @xmath38 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } a_{1}+a_{4 } & a_{2}+a_{3 } \\\\ i\\left ( a_{2}-a_{3}\\right )   & a_{1}-a_{4 } \\end{array } \\right ] ; \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } a_{1 } & a_{2 } \\\\",
    "a_{3 } & a_{4 }",
    "\\end{array } \\right ] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\alpha _ { 0}+\\alpha _ { 3 } & \\alpha _ { 1}-i\\alpha _ { 2 } \\\\ \\alpha _ { 1}+i\\alpha _ { 2 } & \\alpha _ { 0}-\\alpha _ { 3 } \\end{array } \\right ] .\\ ] ]    so , in general , if we were to use the coefficient of expansion in terms of a hermitian set of @xmath39 basis matrices , vectors corresponding to hermitian operators would be real and the hermitian conjugation would act on them as the identity . in the case of non - hermitian basis ,",
    "those vectors are not real , in general , and belong to a real linear @xmath4dimensional submanifold of @xmath40 which is invariant under hermitian conjugation .",
    "now we transfer our discussion of the completeness relation of a basis of vectors , given for the two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 , to the case of the four - dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "thus we get 4-projectors @xmath41 the completeness relation in @xmath0 reads @xmath42 where @xmath43  is the four - dimensional unit matrix . alternatively , in the four - dimensional space , one can have a povm @xmath44  with a set of parameters such that @xmath45 this property means that one can decompose any @xmath46 matrix in terms of the @xmath46 matrices corresponding to the projectors @xmath47  . in matrix form the previous eq.([decom4 ] ) reads @xmath48 that means that the index @xmath49 in eq.([baspro ] ) is considered a double index in labelling the elements of two by two matrices . in principle",
    "one can have more complicated conditions of completeness when the projectors @xmath50 are not orthogonal and have trace different from unity .",
    "then a gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure can be encoded by an extra kernel in the relation ( [ famidec ] ) .",
    "we will see that precisely this situation takes place in some of the examples considered later on .",
    "in general , any kind of tomogram of a pure state @xmath51 is the positive real number @xmath52 depending on a set of parameters @xmath53 which label a set of states @xmath54 defined as : @xmath55 at a first glance , it seems quite difficult to read the tomogram as a scalar product , rather than a square modulus . nevertheless , this is possible by thinking in terms of rank - one projectors rather than of ( pure ) states .",
    "in fact , by using the density operator @xmath56 and the projectors @xmath57 we may interpret the tomogram as a scalar product on the space of rank - one projectors : @xmath58 this definition may be applied also in the case of an arbitrary density operator @xmath59    in the following we wish to characterize the sets of vectors @xmath60 which allow for a complete reconstruction of the state @xmath51 , or an arbitrary density operator @xmath61 from the knowledge of its tomograms @xmath62 these sets will be called _ tomographic sets_. in the light of our interpretation of the tomogram , the meaning of such a reconstruction is nothing but a consequence of a decomposition of identity in the space of rank - one projectors in terms of the family @xmath63 after taking into account that the projectors @xmath64 in general are not orthogonal .",
    "we will discuss our interpretation in the finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "our construction essentially goes along the following lines .",
    "suppose a set @xmath65  of @xmath66  vectors of @xmath67  is found in such a way that the respective projectors @xmath68  are a basis @xmath69  of@xmath70 _ _  _ _ we use here a collective index @xmath49 instead of @xmath71 , e.g. @xmath72 . by means of the gram - schmidt procedure , for instance",
    ", we may convert the basis @xmath69  into an orthonormal basis @xmath73 @xmath74 in general , every element of the orthonormal basis @xmath75 is a linear combination of projectors , rather than a single projector like @xmath76  associated to a vector of @xmath77    there exists a decomposition of the identity on @xmath78@xmath79 where the gram - schmidt kernel @xmath80 has been introduced @xmath81 we observe that @xmath80 is a nonlinear function of the projectors @xmath82 , because also the coefficients @xmath83 s depend on the projectors .",
    "we define the set @xmath65 of @xmath66 vectors of @xmath84 a _ minimal tomographic set_. the tomogram of a density matrix @xmath85 with respect to this minimal tomographic set is defined by @xmath86 then , from the decomposition of identity in terms of the tomographic projectors , we get an inversion formula for the density matrix @xmath85 or any other operator on @xmath87@xmath88 ( \\hat{\\rho})_{\\mu \\nu } .\\ ] ] in other words , writing the previous equation in terms of matrix elements : @xmath89 ( % \\hat{\\rho})_{\\mu \\nu } \\ ] ] we have the corresponding expression for the decomposition of the identity : @xmath90    a set containing more than @xmath66 vectors of @xmath84 is a tomographic set when it contains a minimal set .",
    "in other words , a tomographic set is such that any vector belongs to a ( minimal ) tomographic subset of @xmath66 vectors . in particular ,",
    "a set is tomographic if any subset of @xmath66 vectors is a ( minimal ) tomographic set .",
    "now , a basis of @xmath66  rank - one projectors can always be found .",
    "in fact , an orthonormal basis of @xmath91 containing @xmath66 hermitian operators is associated with the generators @xmath92 of the group @xmath93 , multiplying each element by the imaginary unit @xmath94 .",
    "each generator , using its spectral decomposition , can be written in terms of projectors . moreover ,",
    "each projector can be expressed by means of rank - one projectors .",
    "so , from the spectral decompositions of the generators of @xmath95 we may extract a basis of @xmath66 rank - one projectors .    alternatively , using an orthonormal basis @xmath96 of @xmath39 vectors of @xmath84",
    ", we may define in @xmath97 an orthogonal basis of @xmath66 hermitian operators given by : @xmath98 then , from their spectral decompositions we may extract @xmath99a basis of @xmath100 rank - one projectors .",
    "for example , starting from a fiducial ( orthonormal ) basis of @xmath101 two different suitable unitary operators @xmath102 are needed to generate other two different basis of @xmath103 and obtain a tomographic set of six vectors containing three different minimal tomographic sets .",
    "in fact , starting from the standard basis of @xmath104 , the matrix of 4-vectors @xmath105\\ ] ] has maximal rank , when the two different operators satisfy some extra condition such as , for instance , @xmath106 this condition shows that the two complex numbers @xmath107 and @xmath108 can not be proportional on the reals or , equivalently , they have different phases .",
    "let us characterize more closely the manifold of rank - one projectors in the real space @xmath109of hermitian operators .",
    "using the basis of the generators @xmath92 of @xmath93 , with @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 we may express any hermitian operator @xmath113 as @xmath114 the manifold of rank - one projectors is given by the vectors whose components @xmath115 fulfill the conditions @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( which implies @xmath118 ) . in the dual space @xmath119 of the lie algebra of the generators @xmath120",
    "this manifold is an orbit @xmath121 of the co - adjoint action of the group @xmath93 . as the set of rank - one projectors",
    "may be identified with the projective space @xmath122 with @xmath123 real dimensions , the orbit @xmath124 is the only orbit with the same dimensions placed in the plane @xmath125 among the orbits , @xmath121 is the one with lowest dimensionality , as the stability group of its points is just @xmath126 @xmath127 for instance , for @xmath128 the rank - one projector set is the bloch sphere @xmath129 placed in the plane @xmath130 .",
    "a minimal tomographic set therefore is a set of @xmath66 projectors @xmath131 , where @xmath132 , such that the linear span of @xmath133 is the entire @xmath134 , that is @xmath135 of course , @xmath121 is a maximal tomographic set .",
    "an interesting question is how to find a way to construct tomographic sets .",
    "this question may be answered in different but equivalent ways .",
    "we consider some of them here and provide a few well known examples to show how our proposal works .    the first way consists in taking a fiducial rank - one projector @xmath136 and acting on it with a suitable family of ( at least @xmath137 unitary operators @xmath138 , depending on some parameters @xmath139 .",
    "the family has to be chosen in such a manner that the set of projectors @xmath140 results into a tomographic one .",
    "this is granted only if the family @xmath138 is not contained in any proper subgroup of @xmath93 or , equivalently , if the group generated by the family @xmath141 is @xmath93 .",
    "this condition is also sufficient if , moreover , from the family of unitary operators it is possible to extract , _ via _ the cayley map , for instance , a basis for the lie algebra @xmath142 .",
    "then , a family which is `` skew '' in the group @xmath93 is a suitable _ tomographic family of unitary operators_.    alternatively , it is possible to start with a fiducial hermitian operator @xmath143 and to act on it with a `` skew '' family of unitary operators @xmath138 , generating a family of ( iso - spectral)@xmath99hermitian operators @xmath144 choosing @xmath145 to be generic , i.e. with simple eigenvalues , the action of @xmath141 on the rank - one projectors associated with the eigenstates of @xmath145 gives rise to a tomographic set of projectors .",
    "in other words , we may obtain a tomographic set from a suitable family of hermitian operators .",
    "taking @xmath93 as a tomographic family we obtain a ( maximal ) decomposition of the identity , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ identity ] ) .",
    "however , integrating all projectors @xmath146 over the symplectic orbit @xmath121 and using the volume @xmath147 constructed with the canonical symplectic form @xmath148we have to use a hermitian kernel @xmath149 which is an operator valued function of the point @xmath150 on the orbit @xmath151 that plays the same role of the gram - schmidt kernel in the minimal case : @xmath152 for instance , in the @xmath153 case , we have @xmath154\\label{decompspinker}\\ ] ] so that , for any operator @xmath155it results @xmath156    by using eq .",
    "( [ fullidentity ] ) in the scalar product of any pair of operators @xmath157 we obtain @xmath158 so , at least in a `` weak sense '' , @xmath159 finally , substituting the previous expression of @xmath160 in eq .",
    "( [ fullidentity ] ) , we obtain @xmath161 \\mathrm{tr}(p(m)\\cdot ) \\omega\\ ] ] in full analogy with eq .",
    "( [ identity ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath160 is just a gram - schmidt kernel , at least in a `` weak sense '' .    in general a tomographic family of unitary operators",
    "ranges between a minimal family and a maximal family , and is representative of the whole group @xmath93 , so that necessarily the commutant of the family must be the identity .",
    "then , a decomposition of unity must be available by integrating on the space of parameters of the family with a suitable kernel @xmath162",

    "so , as well known @xcite , only three independent directions of @xmath183  are needed to reconstruct a spin 1/2 state , because the fourth projector is along any direction orthogonal to one of the first three directions",
    ".    however , a decomposition of identity involving the whole family exists and is given by ( see the previous eq.s ( [ decompspinker ] ) , ( [ decompspin ] ) ) @xmath184 we observe that the kernel @xmath185 is the simplest , the only one containing the same few spherical functions which appear in the projectors @xmath186 , but it is not unique .",
    "in fact , a family of equivalent kernels can be obtained by adding to @xmath187  any other kernel @xmath188 , containing only superpositions of spherical functions orthogonal to those of @xmath189    as a matter of fact , in the qu - bit case the equation @xmath190 holds in a strong sense .",

    "the answer to the question is obviously negative @xcite .",
    "the example of two squeezed states described by gaussian wave functions , @xmath261 , \\quad \\psi _ { 2}\\left ( x\\right ) = n\\exp \\left [ -\\alpha ^{\\ast } x^{2}+i\\beta x\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath262 and @xmath263 , demonstrates readily this negative answer .",
    "the moduli of the functions are equal , and also the moduli of their fourier transforms are equal .",
    "but the states are different since the scalar product of the two wave functions gives the fidelity which is not equal to one .",
    "so , different wave functions have the same marginal probability distributions of position and momentum .",
    "now we are able to understand why the answer must be negative : in fact , the family containing only the operators position and momentum is not tomographic because it is too small and can not generate an inversion formula .      finally , we discuss an example where an inversion formula is still lacking : the squeeze tomography @xcite .",
    "the tomogram is defined using the same unitary operators @xmath264 of the symplectic tomography , which acting on the fiducial basis @xmath198 of the photon number tomography generate a basis of squeezed eigenvectors @xmath265 of the squeezed tomographic family @xmath266@xmath267    in this case , however , the commutant of the family @xmath268 contains the parity operator and is nontrivial .",
    "then the family is not a tomographic family _",
    "strictu senso_. nevertheless , we get a true tomographic family by a restriction to the subspace of even wave functions .",
    "then the existence of an inversion formula is granted .",
    "we summarize the main results of the paper . the mechanism why quantum states can be described by fair tomographic probabilities instead of wave functions or density matrices",
    "was clarified .",
    "the mathematical reason for the possibility to express the pure state projector @xmath269 ( or density operator @xmath85 ) in terms of tomograms is based on the simple observation that any kind of tomogram is just a scalar product of the projector , treated as a vector in the hilbert space of operators , and a basis vector in this hilbert space .",
    "the only property to be fulfilled is that the basis vectors in that hilbert space are a complete ( or even an overcomplete ) set . for known examples of tomographies",
    "we have shown that it is always so . in view of this very elementary property",
    "it is even mysterious why the finding of the tomographic probability description of quantum states was done only relatively recently .",
    "consideration of tomograms of quantum states can be conceptually extended to the case of many degrees of freedom and even for the quantum field theory .",
    "in fact one needs only a pair of hilbert spaces , @xmath1 and @xmath270 and constructing a tomographic basis in @xmath271 . in principle",
    ", this consideration is extensible to infinite dimensional case ( fields ) : one only has to add some extra ingredients to take into account the existence of different non - unique representations of the infinite heisenberg - weyl algebra and to use extra topological arguments .",
    "another obvious possibility consists in constructing the basis vectors to provide tomographies by means of the eigenstates of quantum group operators . for the @xmath272 case it only needs the introduction of operators dependent on the casimir ."
