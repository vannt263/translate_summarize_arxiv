    "for some special cases such as @xmath16 , there are various proposals on the field theory duals @xcite .",
    "a subtlety is that r - charges of the matters in such theories can have different values from the canonical one .",

    "also , for a special class of theories such as @xmath18 , the superconformal index is computed and comparison is made with the gravity index @xcite .",
    "a curious technical aspect in computing the index and the partition function is that it is much easier to work out non - chiral theories in 4d sense .",
    "we call 3d theories ` chiral - like theories ' if the matter fields are inherited from chiral matters in 4d .",
    "these chiral - like theories could suffer from parity anomalies and the right index computation needs to take care of this issue properly . in the large @xmath19 computation of the partition function on @xmath17 ,",
