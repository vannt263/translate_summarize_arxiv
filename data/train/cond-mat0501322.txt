    "the purpose of this contribution is to present an overview of the approach to statistical mechanics based on information theory .",
    "the concept of information , intimately connected with that of probability , gives indeed insight on questions of statistical mechanics such as the meaning of irreversibility .",
    "this concept was introduced in statistical physics by brillouin ( 1956 ) and jaynes ( 1957 ) soon after its discovery by shannon in 1948 ( shannon and weaver , 1949 ) . an immense literature has since then been published , ranging from research articles to textbooks .",
    "the variety of topics that belong to this field of science makes it impossible to give here a bibliography , and special searches are necessary for deepening the understanding of one or another aspect . for tutorial introductions ,",
    "somewhat more detailed than the present one , see r. balian ( 1991 - 92 ; 2004 ) .",
    "the meaning of probabilities , on which the concept of information relies , has long been a subject of controversy ( cox , 1946 ) .",
    "they were introduced in the theory of games as frequencies of occurrence , directly related to the counting of configurations , and could be viewed in this framework as properties of the system _ in itself_. this objective interpretation contrasts with the so - called subjective interpretation , which was initiated by bayes and laplace , and later on advocated by jaynes ( 1957 ) and de finetti ( 1974 ) .    while the mathematicians who focus on the structure of the theory of probabilities do not adopt a definite position on their objective or subjective meaning",
    ", the physicists who apply them should worry about their interpretation .",
    "most physicists have reached a spontaneous , often implicit , philosophical position inspired by their daily practice , which combines subjectivism and materialism . during the xixth century , science was generally considered as a discovery of laws of nature existing outside us ; in such an activity the observer can be disregarded once the exploration stage is over .  the development of microphysics during the xxth century has led the physicists to lay more emphasis on the role of the observer . theory is generally regarded as the construction of a partly imperfect image of the external world in our minds , which however becomes less and less blurred , more and more faithful as science progresses .",
    "mathematics provide the precise language which allows us to build this image ; among mathematics , probabilities are the tool on which we rely to make quantitative predictions in a consistent and rational way , starting from the available information , in spite of various uncertainties .",
    "it is remarkable that the introduction of probabilities in our most fundamental theories has not prevented physics to become more and more efficient .",
    "the existence of barriers between the reality and us , which can not be overcome at least at the present stage of physics , has become manifest in two different theoretical frameworks . on the one hand , the unification and",
    "the simplicity of the laws of microphysics have led to a considerable development of _ statistical mechanics_. it has become clear that all properties of materials at the macroscopic scale , whether mechanical , thermal or electromagnetic , can _ in principle _ be explained by starting from their microscopic structure .",
    "macroscopic theories are then reduced to a phenomenological status .",
    "even the laws of thermodynamics have now lost their status of fundamental science since they can be derived from microphysics . however , describing fully a macroscopic object in terms of its microscopic constituents would require to deal with an inaccessibly large number of degrees of freedom . neither can we control them experimentally nor even can we handle them numerically .",
    "our only issue is a probabilistic treatment , where probabilities account for our lack of knowledge about , for instance , the positions and velocities of the molecules in a classical gas .    on the other hand ,",
    "microscopic systems are governed by _",
    "quantum mechanics_. there , physical quantities are mathematically represented as recalled in section 2 by elements of a non - commutative algebra .",
    "this feature implies , in particular , heisenberg s inequality which expresses that two non - commuting variables ( such as the position and the momentum of a particle , the three components of its angular momentum , the electromagnetic field and the number of photons , or the electric and magnetic fields at the same point ) necessarily display statistical fluctuations : the values of such variables can not be specified simultaneously .",
    "here we need probabilities not only for practical reasons as in classical statistical mechanics , but because the fundamental theory itself implies _",
    "intrinsic fluctuations_. it is not simply the _ values _ of the physical variables which are incompletely known , but it is the very _ concept _ of physical quantities which , as a matter of principle , makes them simultaneously inaccessible .",
    "their non - commutative nature forbids us to imagine that we might fully determine them .",
    "it is impossible to assume that , underlying our probabilistic description , the state of a microscopic system at a given time could be characterized by the values of its full set of physical variables .",
    "this impossibility , which contrasts with the use of probabilities in the description of systems in classical statistical mechanics , is exemplified by bell s inequalities and by the ghz paradox ( greenberger et al , 1990 ) that we shall briefly review at the end of section 2 .    in both cases , and a fortiori in quantum statistical mechanics ,",
    "we are led to always treat physical quantities as random .",
    "the probabilities that govern them occur either for practical reasons because we can not hope to describe in full detail a macroscopic system , or for theoretical reasons because quantum fluctuations prevent us from thinking that the whole set of physical quantities needed to describe a system in the quantum formalism may take well - defined values .",
    "thus the probabilities of quantum statistical physics can not be regarded as properties of a system as such , but they characterize the knowledge about this system of its observers in the considered conditions .",
    "the probability law adequately describing the system depends on the information available to the observer or on the number of variables that he may control .",
    "probabilities therefore appear as having a partly subjective nature , on rather inter - subjective since two observers placed in the same conditions will assign the same probability law to a system .",
    "moreover , such a probabilistic description does not refer to a single object .",
    "explicitly or implicitly we regard this object as belonging to a statistical _ ensemble _ of similar objects , all prepared under similar conditions and characterized by the same set of given data .",
    "this ensemble may be real , if we deal with predictions about repeated experiments , or gedanken , if we deal with a single event .    even though quantum mechanics requires the use of probabilities to describe systems at the microscopic scale , and even though these probabilities characterize the knowledge of observers about such systems",
    ", the theory also displays _",
    "objective features _ that depend on the systems only . indeed , as we shall recall below , the microscopic equations of motion of an isolated system are fully deterministic since the hamiltonian operator is exactly known .",
    "( for most properties of atoms , molecules and macroscopic materials , only the very simple kinetic energy and electromagnetic interactions of the elementary constituents , the nuclei and the electrons , are relevant . ) whereas at each time the statistics of the physical quantities are accounted for by a probability law , the _ evolution _ of this law is governed at the microscopic scale by the reversible equation ( [ 002 ] ) below , which depends only on the object studied .",
    "the probability distribution , which characterizes our knowledge , is transferred from one time to another in a deterministic way  unless we drop information or unless part of the hamiltonian is ill - known .",
    "other objective features can also emerge at the macroscopic scale .",
    "owing to the large number of constituents , the probability distribution for many macroscopic variables can be sharply peaked .",
    "the uncertainties of the observers and the subjective aspect of probabilities can then be disregarded , and statistical predictions are replaced by objective assertions , which hold even for a single object .",
    "the first stage of an inference consists in assigning to the system a probability distribution that accounts for the available data but is otherwise unbiased .",
    "then , predictions are derived from this distribution by means of standard techniques of statistical physics . for instance",
    ", we may wish to predict the two - particle correlation function in a simple liquid at equilibrium , so as to understand how it scatters light ; in this problem the data which characterize the macroscopic equilibrium state are the energy and particle number per unit volume .",
    "this correlation function can be deduced from the density in phase , that is , the probability distribution of the @xmath1 particles of the liquid in the @xmath2-dimensional phase space .",
    "however a preliminary question should be solved : from the sole knowledge of the energy and the particle number , how should we reasonably choose this probability distribution ?",
    "we shall work within the framework of quantum statistical mechanics ( thirring , 1981 , 1983 ; balian , 1989 ) , which is conceptually somewhat simpler than classical statistical mechanics . to avoid mathematical complications , we consider finite systems only and assume that the thermodynamic limit for extensive systems is taken in the end .",
    "the discreteness of spectra is then a feature which allows to by - pass some difficulties arising in classical statistical mechanics from the continuity of the variables .",
    "for instance , the classical limit of quantum statistical mechanics generates the suitable measure in the @xmath2-dimensional phase space ; this measure includes a factor @xmath3 issued from the pauli principle for indistinguishable particles , which ensures the extensivity of entropy and solves the gibbs paradox .",
    "these facts can be explained in the framework of classical statistical mechanics ( van kampen , 1984 ) , but less automatically . obtaining the third law of thermodynamics as a consequence of statistical mechanics also requires quantization , since the behaviour at low temperatures of the entropy of a macroscopic system is governed by the low energy behaviour of its level density .",
    "the mathematical description of a physical system in quantum mechanics involves a hilbert space , and the physical quantities are represented by the hermitean operators @xmath4 in this space . as indicated in the introduction",
    ", these operators , termed _ observables _ , play the rle of random variables but constitute a non - commutative algebra .",
    "for instance , the three components of the spin @xmath5 of a fermion are described in a @xmath6-dimensional hilbert space by the pauli operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , which are characterized by the algebra @xmath10 ; for a particle on a line , the algebra is generated by the position and momentum operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the hilbert space of wavefunctions , with @xmath13   = i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "the specific features of quantum physics , compared to the standard probability theory or to the classical statistical mechanics , lie in this non - commutation of the observables .    in quantum mechanics , the state of a system , whatever formalism",
    "is used to characterize it ( wavefunction , state vector , density matrix , etc ) , is an irreducibly probabilistic concept . as stressed in the introduction",
    ", one can not imagine the existence of an underlying , purely objective description in terms of the values of all the physical quantities attached to the system .",
    "we are led to adhere to the bayesian or laplacian subjective conception of probabilities , and to regard the state  as the best possible description of the system , which allows us to make any possible probabilistic prediction about it  or rather about the statistical ensemble to which it belongs .",
    "a set of probabilities is equivalent to the collection of expectation values that they allow us to evaluate .",
    "quantum state _ is thus characterized by the _ correspondence _",
    "@xmath14 which associates with _ any observable _ @xmath15 _",
    "its expectation value _ @xmath16 in the considered situation .",
    "this correspondence has a few natural properties .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath17 entails that @xmath16 is real ( quantum mechanics involves complex numbers , but physical predictions yield real numbers ) . for the unit operator , @xmath18 .",
    "the correspondence is linear ; in fact , the linearity @xmath19 for any pair of _ commuting _ observables @xmath4 and @xmath20 is sufficient to imply linearity for the whole set of observables ( provided the dimension of the hilbert space is larger than @xmath6 : gleason s theorem ) .",
    "finally the statistical fluctuation of a physical quantity is expressed as @xmath21 in terms of the expectation values ( [ 001 ] ) . imposing that @xmath22 is non - negative for any hermitean",
    "@xmath4 expresses that a variance can not be negative .    for finite systems these properties",
    "are implemented through the existence of a _ density operator _ @xmath23 in hilbert space which represents the state .",
    "the above correspondence from observables to their expectation values is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath23 is a hermitean positive operator with unit trace .",
    "the density operator thus gathers our whole probabilistic information about the full set of observables of the system .",
    "it plays with respect to observables the same rle as a usual probability distribution does with respect to random variables . a wavefunction or",
    "a state vector @xmath25 appears as nothing but a special case of density operator ; in this case @xmath26 reduces to a projection on the considered pure state and the expectation values ( [ 001 ] ) read @xmath27 .",
    "note that , due to the irreducibly probabilistic nature of the quantum theory , there is no conceptual difference between quantum mechanics  and quantum statistical mechanics , since a wavefunction is nothing but a means for evaluating probabilities .    for time - dependent problems ,",
    "we need in order to make predictions to express how this information ( [ 001 ] ) , given at some time , is transformed at later times .",
    "this is expressed in the schrdinger picture by letting @xmath23 depend on time while the observables @xmath4 remain fixed .",
    "for an isolated system , with given hamiltonian @xmath28 , the evolution of @xmath29 is governed by the _ liouville ",
    "von  neumann equation _ of motion : @xmath30   \\text{\\ .}% \\tag{2}\\label{002}%\\ ] ]    whereas the definition of quantum states involves both the system and the observers and has a subjective aspect because the density operator appears as a tool to make consistent predictions from the available information , the evolution refers to the system only .",
    "this purely objective nature of the evolution is made clear in the alternative heisenberg picture , where the density operator @xmath23 remains fixed while the observables change in time according to heisenberg s equation of motion @xmath31   \\text { , } % \\tag{3}\\label{003}%\\ ] ] which is deterministic and reversible .",
    "equations ( [ 002 ] ) and ( [ 003 ] ) are equivalent as regards the evolution of the expectation values ( [ 001 ] ) .",
    "heisenberg s equation ( [ 003 ] ) exhibits better the fact that the dynamics is a property of the considered system , since it deals with the observables which represent mathematically the physical quantities belonging to this system , independently of observation .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ 003 ] ) simply expresses that the operator _",
    "algebra remains unchanged _ in time while the various observables @xmath4 evolve ; this property is equivalent to the unitary of the evolution , with the hamiltonian as generator of the unitary motion . as another advantage , heisenberg s",
    "picture allows us to evaluate correlations between observables of the same system taken at different times .",
    "however , because we focus below on information , we shall start from schrdinger s picture rather than heisenberg s . when expressed by means of ( [ 002 ] ) instead of ( [ 003 ] ) , the evolution takes a subjective aspect , since ( [ 002 ] ) describes the transfer of information from some observables to other ones generated by a completely known dynamics .",
    "we can then modify eq .",
    "( [ 002 ] ) so as to account for losses of information that may take place during a dynamical process .",
    "in the _ classical limit _ , observables @xmath4  are replaced by commuting random variables , which are functions of the positions and momenta of the @xmath1  particles .",
    "density operators @xmath23  are replaced by probability densities @xmath32  in the @xmath2-dimensional phase space , and the trace in ( [ 001 ] ) by an integration over this space .",
    "the evolution of @xmath32 is governed by the liouville equation .    to conclude this section , we show how the _ irreducibly probabilistic _ nature of quantum states follows from the non - commutation of the observables .",
    "consider first two physical quantities represented by two observables @xmath15 and @xmath20 which do not commute , @xmath33 = 2i\\hat{c}$ ] .",
    "since for any @xmath34 the operator @xmath35 can be regarded as the square of a hermitean operator ( as obvious by diagonalization ) , its expectation value is non - negative , which implies @xmath36 .",
    "this heisenberg s inequality sets a lower bound to statistical fluctuations ( for instance , @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 yields @xmath40 ) .",
    "accordingly , non - commuting physical quantities are _ incompatible _ : they can not be measured nor even specified simultaneously .",
    "bell s inequalities and the ghz paradox ( greenberger et al , 1990 ) also arise from non - commutation .",
    "consider , for instance , three spins * * * * @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath6 , @xmath43 ; define the observables @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 by cyclic permutation .",
    "all of them have @xmath50 and @xmath51 as eigenvalues , the @xmath4 s commute with one another as well as the @xmath20 s and @xmath52 commutes with @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , @xmath47 and @xmath55 anticommute , so that the three observables @xmath56 commute with one another .",
    "hence , we can imagine that the @xmath43-spin system is prepared in a pure state @xmath57 which is the common eigenvector of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 characterized by their eigenvalues @xmath61",
    ", @xmath62 , @xmath63 all equal to @xmath50 . in this state",
    ", the fact that @xmath64 takes the value @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 ; more precisely , if we were to measure @xmath67 and @xmath68 simultaneously ( they commute ) , we would find for them either the values @xmath69 or the values @xmath70 ( with equal probabilities since the expectation value of @xmath67 or @xmath71 vanishes ) .",
    "likewise we can assert the complete correlations @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "however the above definitions and algebraic relations imply the operator identities @xmath74 and @xmath75 . hence , although the three statements @xmath66 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( in the above sense ) are _ separately true _ , they can not be true _ together _ : since the product @xmath78 takes the value @xmath79 in the considered state @xmath25 , the simultaneous measurement of @xmath67 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( which commute ) is expected to yield values @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 equal to @xmath50 or @xmath51 , but necessarily with a product @xmath85 , in contradiction to the naive prediction @xmath86 which would result from @xmath87 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath88 .",
    "this has been experimentally confirmed .",
    "thus , everyday s logics is violated .",
    "the only issue is to regard the state  not as a property of the system alone , but as a probabilistic means for prediction .",
    "the current expression the state of the system  that we used ( and that we may still use for convenience below ) is improper ; it is meant as the probability distribution ( for non - commuting physical quantities ) which allows us to predict the properties of the statistical ensemble in which the system is embedded .",
    "indeed , we can safely predict that a measurement of @xmath67 and @xmath89 will give @xmath66 for any element of the ensemble , and likewise for @xmath80 and @xmath90 .",
    "however , such measurements must be performed with _",
    "different apparatuses _ on _ different samples _",
    "( described by the same state vector @xmath25 ) , because @xmath91 and @xmath92 do not commute and hence can not be measured nor even specified simultaneously .",
    "we can not find in the ensemble any system for which @xmath67 takes with certainty , say , the value @xmath93 and @xmath94 the value @xmath95 : the assertion that _ both _",
    "@xmath66 _ and _ @xmath72 is meaningless .",
    "the contradiction existing between the equalities @xmath96 , @xmath72 , @xmath77 , @xmath97 and @xmath85 implies that we should _ not _ regard the two correlations @xmath87 and @xmath72 as _ intrinsic properties _ of the system , but rather consider _ each one as an exact prediction about a specific measurement _ , namely that of @xmath67 and @xmath98 in one case , that of @xmath80 and @xmath92 in the other case , the measurements of @xmath67 and @xmath92 being incompatible .",
    "the state vector @xmath25 itself , which synthesizes all such information , does not describe intrinsic properties of the systems belonging to the considered ensemble , but rather tells us how they would behave in some experiment or another .",
    "each assertion such as @xmath96 ( which to be tested would require an interaction of a system with an apparatus measuring @xmath67 and @xmath98 ) , is true _ only in a given context _",
    ", which should be specified even if the measurement is not actually performed .",
    "the interpretation of quantum mechanics is thus tightly connected with measurement theory .",
    "the type of correlations that it involves can not be accounted for in terms of hidden variables .",
    "the knowledge embodied in a density operator @xmath23 is always probabilistic , since @xmath23 provides us only with the expectation values ( [ 001 ] ) . at least some among the variances evaluated from ( [ 001 ] ) must be finite , due to non - commutation , because there exists no common eigenvector for the whole set of observables .",
    "it is therefore natural to wonder whether one density operator is more informative than another ( thirring , 1983 ; balian , 1991 ) . to this aim",
    "we associate with each @xmath23 a number , the _ von  neumann entropy _ @xmath99 which measures in dimensionless units our uncertainty when @xmath23 summarizes our statistical knowledge on the system .",
    "this quantity is the quantum analogue of shannon s entropy @xmath100 ; the latter number measures the amount of _ information which is missing _ on average when we wait for the reception of some message belonging to a set @xmath101 , if each message @xmath102 is expected to occur with a probability @xmath103 ( shannon and weaver , 1949 ) .",
    "however , here , there will be no reception of a message since we shall never observe fully the system at the microscopic scale .",
    "the quantity @xmath104 qualifies merely our present knowledge through @xmath23 , without reference to future observations which can change our information .",
    "we may also interpret @xmath104 as a measure of the _ disorder _ that we are facing when our information is characterized by @xmath23 .",
    "this identification of the concept of disorder with a lack of knowledge may seem questionable , since disorder seems an objective property of the system whereas information is attached to the observer .",
    "however , even in everyday s life , we can recognize that disorder is a relative property .",
    "my desk may look quite disordered to a visitor , but it is _ for me _ in perfect order , if i am able to retrieve immediately any one of the many files that lie scattered on it .",
    "likewise , a pack of cards fully mixed by a conjurer is disordered for the audience , but not for him , if he has kept knowledge of the ordering of the cards .",
    "information theory allows us to make quantitative maxwell s remark about the concept of order : `` confusion , like the correlative term order , is not a property of material things in themselves , but only in relation to the mind who perceives them '' .    historically , boltzmann was the first to identify , in many successive works , the entropy of thermodynamics with a functional of the distribution in phase space of classical statistical mechanics  even though the concept of probability was not yet fully settled .",
    "von  neumann extended this idea to quantum physics by introducing the definition ( [ 004 ] ) .",
    "the existence of these expressions inspired shannon ( 1949 ) when he created the theory of communication , which is based on the possibility of assigning numbers to amounts of information . in this context , the subjective nature of entropy is manifest . from the fact that it measures the missing information associated with the probability distribution for the considered set of messages , it appeared that it was a general concept complementing probability . with this new interpretation as lack of information at the microscopic scale ,",
    "the concept has returned to statistical physics ( brillouin , 1956 ; jaynes , 1957 ) , throwing new lights on entropy .",
    "the von  neumann entropy is characterized by many properties which confirm its interpretation as a measure of _ uncertainty_. it is _ additive _ for uncorrelated systems , _ subadditive _ for correlated ones ( which means that suppressing correlations raises the uncertainty ) , _ concave _ ( which means that putting together two different statistical ensembles for the same system produces a mixed ensemble which has a larger uncertainty than the average of the uncertainties of the original ensembles ) .",
    "the _ maximum _",
    "@xmath105 of ( [ 004 ] ) is obtained , for a finite hilbert space with dimension @xmath106 when @xmath107 .",
    "its _ minimum _ @xmath108 is obtained for pure states @xmath23 , which are the least uncertain states that quantum mechanics allows , although they are still probabilistic .",
    "the availability of the density operator @xmath23 at a given time @xmath109 allows us to make any statistical prediction on the considered system ( or more precisely on a statistical ensemble to which it belongs ) , either at the same time through ( [ 001 ] ) , or at later times through ( [ 002 ] ) .",
    "however , a preliminary problem arises . during the preparation of the system , before the time @xmath109",
    ", only a small set of data are controlled .",
    "let us denote as @xmath110 the observables that are controlled , and as @xmath111 their expectation values for the considered set of repeated experiments . from this",
    "_ partial information _ we wish to _ infer _ other quantities . in other words",
    ", we wish to assign to the system a density operator @xmath23 , by relying on the sole knowledge of the set @xmath112    the maximum entropy criterion consists in selecting , among all the density operators subject to the _ constraints _ ( [ 005 ] ) , the one , @xmath113 , which renders the _ von  neumann entropy _ ( [ 004 ] ) _ maximum _ ( jaynes , 1957 ) .",
    "an intuitive justification is the following : for any other @xmath23 compatible with ( [ 005 ] ) , we have by construction @xmath114 .",
    "the choice of @xmath115 thus ensures that our description involves _ no more information _ than the minimum needed to account for the only available information ( [ 005 ] ) . the difference @xmath116 measures some extra information included in @xmath23 , but not in @xmath113 , and hence , not in the only known expectation values @xmath117",
    ". selecting @xmath115 rather than any other @xmath23 which satisfies ( [ 005 ] ) is therefore the _ least biased choice _ , the one that allows the most reasonable predictions drawn from the known set @xmath111 about other arbitrary quantities ( [ 001 ] ) .",
    "we may also interpret the maximum entropy criterion as the choice of the _ most uncertain _ state among those which satisfy the constraints ( [ 005 ] ) imposed by the data @xmath111 , or equivalently of the _ most disordered _ one .",
    "this criterion may be regarded as a generalization of laplace s _ principle of insufficient reason _ ( or bayes s principle ) , which states that equal probabilities should be assigned to all possible events in case nothing is known about the occurrence of these events .",
    "indeed , if the hilbert space associated with the system has a finite dimension @xmath106 , the entropy is largest when @xmath23 is proportional to the unit matrix @xmath118 , so that the criterion yields @xmath119 , describing equiprobability , in case there are no constraints ( [ 005 ] ) on expectation values .",
    "this use of the lack of information as a tool for statistical inference has a weakness : it relies on the assumption that @xmath120 is the adequate measure of bias in statistical physics .",
    "direct justifications of the outcome of the maximum entropy criterion , based on some requirements of consistency of the inference procedure , have therefore been given .",
    "they are discussed in detail by uffink ( 1995 ) .",
    "an alternative direct justification relies on the introduction of a supersystem , made of a large number @xmath121 of mental copies @xmath122 of the system in hand .",
    "the statistical data are the same for all individual systems @xmath123 , i.e. , the observables @xmath124 have the same _ expectation _ value @xmath111 .",
    "this value is identified with the value of the _ average _ observable @xmath125 pertaining to the supersystem , which has weak statistical fluctuations ( at most in @xmath126 , due to non - commutation of the observables @xmath110 ) .",
    "such an identification throws a bridge between the subjective and frequencial interpretations of probabilities .",
    "the maximum entropy criterion then arises merely as a consequence of the principle of insufficient reason applied to the supersystem .",
    "this idea was introduced by gibbs in the case where the only datum ( [ 005 ] ) is the energy : he showed that , for large @xmath121 , each system @xmath123 is in canonical equilibrium if a microcanonical distribution is assigned to the supersystem .",
    "the extension to quantum statistical mechanics , with non - commuting observables @xmath110 , was worked out by balian and balazs ( 1987 ) .",
    "for any given set of _ relevant observables _",
    "@xmath110 , the expectation values @xmath111 of which are known , the maximum of the von  neumann entropy ( [ 004 ] ) under the constraints ( [ 005 ] ) is readily found by introducing lagrangian multipliers , @xmath127 associated with each equation ( [ 005 ] ) and @xmath128 associated with the normalization of @xmath23 . its value , @xmath129 , is reached for a density operator of the form @xmath130 \\text{\\ , } \\tag{6}\\label{006}%\\ ] ] where the multipliers are determined by @xmath131 this least biased density operator has an exponential form , which generalizes the usual gibbs distributions and which arises from the logarithm in the definition of the von  neumann entropy .",

    "the longer time - scale which characterizes the motion of the relevant set @xmath111 , including the experimentally accessible variables , is associated with some specificities of the dynamics : local conservation laws for the thermodynamic regime , large ratio between the interparticle distance and the range of forces for gases in the ballistic regime .",

    "nevertheless , similar paradoxical evolutions which violate at a macroscopic scale the laws of thermodynamics have been built up , through subtle experiments of nuclear magnetism ( abragam and goldman , 1982 ) .",

    "likewise , the spins that precess slower have been brought forward by the pulse . hence , after a second time lapse @xmath266 , during which the precession goes on with the same local frequency , all the spins reach the initial direction along @xmath285 , and the total magnetization @xmath282 _ returns to its largest possible value _",

    "this paradoxical evolution can be understood only by keeping track of _ all _ the microscopic spin degrees of freedom .    in this spin echo experiment ,",
    "the order about @xmath282 , lost between the time @xmath108 and @xmath266 and recovered between @xmath266 and @xmath267 , is associated with the _ correlation for each spin _ , which during the motion is established  between the direction of the vector @xmath322 in the @xmath286-plane and the value @xmath288 of the @xmath271-component of the local magnetic field .",

    "even if we are given the full available information , to wit , the seemingly dead density operator @xmath324 issued from @xmath303 and the hamiltonian @xmath28 that generated the evolution , we would have an extreme difficulty to uncover , among this huge amount of data , the crucial correlations between @xmath322 and @xmath288 .",

    "he succeeds in this task owing to a specificity of the motion : it is two - dimensional except during a pulse , and we can see that the rotation @xmath327 around the @xmath285-axis has an effect akin to a time reversal .",
    "indeed , noting that the final state is invariant under the rotation @xmath328 around @xmath285 , we can write the evolution operator between the times @xmath108 and @xmath267 as @xmath329 since the components @xmath330 of the field have little effect , we can write @xmath331 this change of sign has the same effect as a _ time - reversal _ taking place during the second part of the process , which therefore brings us back to the initial states at the time @xmath267 .",
    "after the time @xmath267 , the evolution is exactly the same as after the initial time @xmath108 and @xmath273 returns to zero .",
    "the operation can then be _ iterated _ , and the measurement of the length of @xmath332 provides a sequence of peaks .",
    "their height slowly decreases due to the other relaxation mechanisms that we have neglected on the time scale @xmath289 .",
    "spin echoes have thus become a current technique in nuclear magnetic resonance to determine relaxation times with precision and thus explore matter .    at the epoch of their discovery",
    ", these spin echoes were regarded as somewhat miraculous since they violated thermodynamics : they appeared as an exceptional macroscopic phenomenon that can be explained only through the microscopic dynamics .",
    "full knowledge of @xmath324 and of @xmath28 is needed here , whereas the thermodynamic phenomena can be described in terms of the reduced state @xmath333 and of @xmath28 only .",
    "we may , however , argue that the order which is retrieved was not very deeply hidden .",
    "it lay at the time @xmath266 in the rather trivial set of correlations between the orientation of each spin and the size of the corresponding local field .",
    "it is natural to think that the relaxation induced by the _ spin - spin interactions _ should in actual fact be incurable , in the same way as the collision - induced relaxation in a gas .",
    "nevertheless , quite surprisingly , spin - echo experiments of a different type have been performed , in which the _ death _  of spins ( @xmath334 ) caused after the relaxation time @xmath297 by the term @xmath300 of ( [ 029 ] ) is followed by their _ resurrection _  ( abragam and goldman , 1982 ) .",
    "we only sketch here the basic ideas .",
    "the considered experiments are performed on solids , for which @xmath290 is significant .",
    "the applied field is sufficiently uniform so that the duration of the experiment is much shorter than @xmath289 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 029 ] ) can therefore be simplified into @xmath335 .",
    "the experiment begins as in hahn s spin echoes by the preparation of an initial state with @xmath336 , @xmath306 , then during the larmor precession by its decay , taking now place under the effect of @xmath290 . at a time @xmath266 larger than @xmath297 ,",
    "the magnetization is lost as above , but now the relaxation has taken place ( as in the case of gases ) through a cascade of flip - flop transitions involving more and more spins .",
    "the initial order has dissolved into complicated many - spin correlations , and the density operator @xmath337 is equivalent , as regards observables involving a finite number of spins , to a dead  equilibrium state with large temperature .",
    "after the time @xmath266 , a sequence of suitably chosen brief pulses and lasting time - dependent fields referred to as a `` _ _ magic sandwich _ _ '' , is applied for a duration @xmath338 .",
    "thus , during this period , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath339 where @xmath340 is proportional to the time - dependent applied field .",
    "the remarkable fact is the possibility of choosing @xmath340 in such a way that the unitary operator which describes the evolution between the times @xmath266 and @xmath341 has approximately the form @xmath342",
    "\\right\\ }   \\simeq\\exp\\left [   i\\lambda\\hat{h}\\tau^{\\prime}% /\\hbar\\right ] \\tag{33}\\label{033}%\\ ] ] ( @xmath343 denotes time - ordering ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath34 is positive , so that , as in eqs .",
    "( [ 030 ] ) ( [ 031 ] ) , the effect of the magic sandwich @xmath340 is to replace @xmath338 by @xmath344 , thus _ changing effectively the arrow of time _ in the considered interval .",
    "the actual realization of eq .",
    "( [ 033 ] ) has needed great ingenuity , because the dipolar interactions contained in @xmath28  involve pairwise interactions whereas the external operations are represented by a mere field coupled to @xmath275  only .    as an example , in one of the experiments performed , @xmath340  in ( [ 033 ] ) describes a magic sandwich consisting of three successive operations : ( i ) at the time @xmath266 , a pulse @xmath301  along @xmath302 is exerted , represented by the operator @xmath345 ; ( ii ) between the times @xmath266  and @xmath341 , a radiofrequency field along @xmath285 , with a frequency @xmath291  and an intensity @xmath346  is applied ; in the larmor rotating frame , it provides a contribution @xmath347  to the hamiltonian ; ( iii ) at the time @xmath341  a pulse @xmath348  is applied along @xmath302 .",
    "the evolution operator ( [ 033 ] ) , written in the rotating frame , is thus @xmath349   \\hat{u}=\\exp\\left ( -i\\hat{u}^{\\dagger}\\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{ss}}\\hat{u}\\tau^{\\prime}/\\hbar -i\\omega^{\\prime}\\hat{m}_{z}\\tau^{\\prime}\\right )   \\text { .}\\tag{34}\\label{034}%\\ ] ] if @xmath350  is sufficiently large , the part of @xmath351  which does not commute with @xmath352  is negligible , and one finds @xmath353 which replaces here ( [ 031 ] )",
    ". the last term in ( [ 034 ] ) amounts to a trivial larmor rotation . thus ( [ 033 ] ) is satisfied ( in the rotating frame ) with @xmath354 .    after the time @xmath341  the evolution",
    "is again governed by the sole hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "hence , provided @xmath338  is larger than @xmath355 , we can introduce a delay @xmath356  such that @xmath357 , for which the full evolution operator from @xmath358 to @xmath359 , found from ( [ 032 ] ) and ( [ 033 ] ) is nearly the unit operator .",
    "the magnetization @xmath360  thus returns to its initial value @xmath361  although it had previously decayed to zero during the time @xmath266 . here",
    "again the arrow of time is challenged .",
    "the features of this process are the same as in hahn s echoes , in particular the _ recovery of hidden order _ and the need for explaining this phenomenon to rely on _ all the microscopic degrees of freedom _ , although the observations and the manipulations concern only the macroscopic quantities @xmath282 .",
    "however , here , the order that is experimentally retrieved had been transferred by the evolution towards extremely complicated correlations of large numbers of spins , and the initial decay seemed genuinely irreversible as in the case of a gas . indeed , for nearly all experiments which can be realized in practice , the state @xmath324 which involves these special correlations keeping memory of @xmath362 gives the same predictions as the reduced equilibrium state @xmath115 .",
    "nevertheless , the magic sandwich manipulation , which is rather tricky , transforms back these special correlations of @xmath363 into the initial order restored in @xmath364 .",
    "the magic sandwich experiments achieve , for spins , the analogue of the hypothetical reversal of velocities for a gas ; quite remarkably , it is simply the application of some special uniform time - dependent magnetic fields which overcomes here the apparent disorder generated by the interactions .",
    "an analysis of various physical processes where we made use of the information concept has led us to stress the _ relative _ nature of entropy , identified with missing information .",
    "depending on the circumstances , macroscopic phenomena should be described in terms of different sets of relevant variables .",
    "different associated entropies are thus introduced , even for the same system .",
    "the entropy of thermodynamics is only one of them .",
    "dissipation , which is also relative , is measured by the increase of some relevant entropy .",
    "it characterizes the irreversibility of a macroscopic process , and can be interpreted as an irretrievable leak of information towards inaccessible degrees of freedom . since information , as well as probability , is a concept associated with the knowledge of observers about an object rather than with the object in itself , thermodynamic notions such as entropy and dissipation have at the microscopic level a _ subjective _ aspect .",
    "this subjective character is exemplified by the spin - echo experiments , which show that _ irreversibility itself is relative_. in such circumstances the loss of memory which accompanies an irreversibility may be overcome and a hidden order , which keeps track of the initial state , may come into view .    however , in less exotic circumstances , for instance , for systems displaying a collective motion or for materials that can be described by thermodynamics , it is possible to select among the huge set of microscopic variables some subset of relevant variables which obey autonomous equations of motion .",
    "the latter dynamical equations are often identified with phenomenological equations .",
    "their establishment from microphysics involves approximations , such as the short - memory approximation , but they can hold with a high precision if there is a clear - cut separation of time - scales which allows the elimination of irrelevant variables .",
    "the existence of these variables manifests itself through quasi - instantaneous dissipative effects .",
    "such a reduction of the description brings in new features , which differ _ qualitatively _ from those of microphysics , especially for macroscopic systems : continuity and extensivity of matter at our scale , irreversibility and non - linearity of the equations of motion , existence of phase transitions , enormous variety of behaviours in spite of the simplicity of the elementary constituents and in spite of the unicity of the microscopic laws . due to the change of scale , the statistical fluctuations of the relevant observables are small compared to experimental or computational errors .",
    "the _ very nature of our description _ is thus changed .",
    "although the underlying , more fundamental description yields predictions having subjective features due to the necessary use of probabilities , it gives way to a reduced description that no longer involves the observer .",
    "since the variances are negligible , the physical quantities do not need to be regarded as random variables .",
    "the expectation values @xmath365 which obey the reduced dynamics can be interpreted merely as values actually taken in a given system .",
    "their equations of motion then directly apply to individual objects , without reference to a statistical ensemble . in spite of the disappearance of probabilities at the macroscopic scale ,",
    "the relevant entropy survives as a quantity measurable indirectly through its variations ( [ 011 ] ) and characterizing equilibrium , as well known in thermodynamics .",
    "its probabilistic and subjective origin , its interpretation as missing information are not apparent ; neither are they for the other variables , the expectations @xmath111 and the parameters @xmath127 of the microscopic probability law .",
    "actually all these quantities had already been introduced in thermodynamics at the macroscopic level , but the advent of statistical mechanics gave us a deeper understanding .",
    "indeed , statistical mechanics is a major tool of reductionism ; its use explains the _ emergence _ at a larger scale of new properties , new concepts and even different interpretations of physical statements , such as here the emergence of objectivity from a microscopic theory based on the subjective concepts of probability and information .",
    "likewise , treating quantum measurements as a problem of statistical mechanics ( allahverdyan et al , 2003 ) shows how ordinary probabilities emerge from the underlying irreducible extension of probabilities which accounts for the non - commutation of quantum observables .",
    "let us finally recall that the identification of entropy with a lack of information or equivalently with disorder has contributed to the elucidation of the paradox of _",
    "maxwell s demon _ , which gave rise to discussions for more than one century .",
    "an important step was the recognition of the equivalence between information and negentropy ( brillouin , 1956 ) .",
    "the entropy of a system spontaneously increases ; however it may be lowered by some amount , provided the demon  or the experimentalist who acts upon this system makes use of some amount of information at least equal to the decrease of the entropy .",
    "conversely , in order to acquire some information , we need to raise the entropy of some system by a quantity at least equal to the amount of information gained .",
    "information theory thus enlightens many aspects of statistical physics .",
