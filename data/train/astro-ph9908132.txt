    "during the so - called kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the lepton number decreases in the pns due to the loss of neutrinos and consequently the pns evolves in about 10 to 30 seconds into a hot , lepton poor neutron star ( hns ) with an entropy per baryon , @xmath11 , depending on the model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "after several minutes this hns cools to a cold neutron star ( cns ) with temperatures @xmath12 mev throughout the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pns is in @xmath14-equilibrium during its lifetime , since the time scale of the weak - interaction is much smaller than the evolutionary time scale , i.e. the neutrino diffusion time scale or the neutrino cooling time scale , respectively .",
    "hence the evolution of a pns can be studied by considering quasi - stationary models at different times .",
    "the properties of pns s were investigated by different authors .",
    "for example , the case of non - rotating pns s was studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the case of rotating pns s was treated by @xcite and @xcite by means of an empirical formula for the kepler frequency which was developed for cns s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite account for rapid rotation by using an exact , general relativistic approach .",
    "finally , @xcite have performed the case of differential rotation of pns s .",
    "most of these authors did not utilize an equation of state ( eos ) of hot matter throughout the whole star ( except * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but used an eos of cold matter for the envelope of the star instead .",
    "as we will show , this simplification leads to radii ( kepler frequencies ) which are too small ( large ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the properties of non - rotating and rapidly , uniformly rotating pns s .",
    "we use an exact , general relativistic approach to rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "the hot dense matter is described by a recently devolped eos @xcite , which is based on a modern parametrisation of the thomas - fermi approach for finite nuclei and cold nuclear matter performed by @xcite .",
    "we generalize this approach to hot dense matter by taking the thermal effects on both the kinetic and the interaction energy into account . in this way",
    ", we construct a set of eos s with different profiles of the entropy per baryon and different lepton numbers .",
    "we can follow the evolution of the pns into a cns , by means of this set , at different evolutionary stages .",
    "we also investigate the influence of the location and the shape of the neutrino sphere as well as the influence of the value of the temperature in the star s envelope .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , in sect .  [ sec2 ] we will briefly review the physics in the interior of pns s and describe the different evolutionary stages of pns s and ns s .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the location and the shape of the neutrino sphere .",
    "the eos s of pns and ns matter are described in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where we emphasize the influence of finite temperature and trapped lepton number .",
    "the properties of rotating and non - rotating pns s and ns s are presented in sect .",
    "finally , discussion of our results and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "a pns differs in several respects from a cns : at the beginning of its lifetime the pns contains a high lepton number , @xmath15 , since the core is opaque with respect to neutrinos .",
    "a further difference is the high temperature which can not be neglected with respect to the fermi temperature throughout the whole pns .",
    "we define , as usual , the lepton number , @xmath16 , as the sum of the net electron fraction , @xmath17 , ( where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the baryon number density , the electron number density , and the positron number density , respectively ) and the net electron neutrino fraction , @xmath21 , ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electron neutrino number density and the electron anti - neutrino number density , respectively ) .",
    "since the muon number density is small in a pns , they are neglected here .",
    "the reason for the small muon number is that the muon lepton family number is conserved , @xmath24 , while the neutrinos are trapped .",
    "relativistic calculations lead to the conclusion that ns s and pns s are composed not only of nucleons and leptons but also of hyperons and , possibly , of nucleon isobars ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "nevertheless , we shall not take these particle species into account . in view of the rather large uncertainties of the hyperon couplings",
    ", we shall , as a first approach to this problem , neglect these additional degrees of freedom . in the following we select four different stages in the evolution of pns s and ns s , namely at times @xmath25 ms , @xmath26 s , @xmath27 s , and @xmath28 some minutes after core bounce .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the minimum baryonic mass of our non - rotating epns sequences is in the range @xmath29 . the minimum mass is increased in the case of kepler rotating stars to @xmath30 . if accretion is neglected the baryonic mass is conserved during the evolution of the epns to the cns .",
    "we follow the evolution of the minimum mass epns@xmath31 and epns@xmath32 model to a cns via the lpns and the hns stage ( see table [ evolvmin ] ) .",
    "the minimum mass of a cns born in a supernova is therefore determined by the minimum mass model of the epns sequence .",
    "the above ranges of baryonic mass correspond to a lower limit of the gravitational cns s mass in the range @xmath33 .",
    "this is by a factor of ten larger than the minimum mass of the cns sequence .",
    "this property of epns s was also recently found by @xcite .",
    "variations of the location of the transition region between the envelope ( high entropy per baryon ) and the core ( low entropy per baryon ) of the epns s do not change the minimum mass considerably .",
    "starting the transition region at lower densities will lead to smaller minimum masses of the epns s , but the lower the initial mass of the epns is , the higher is the entropy per baryon in the envelope and in the core ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect drives the minimum mass back to higher values , so that our results of the minimum mass range is a good approximation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite examine the most likely masses of ns s using the numerical data of @xcite who simulated type - ii supernovae with progenitor stars in the mass range between 11 and 40@xmath34 .",
    "they obtain a lower limit of the ns mass , which depends on the mass and the composition of the progenitor , of @xmath35  @xmath34 .",
    "this lower limit is comparable to our results .      in table",
    "[ neutrinosphere ] , we compare the properties of our pns and ns models for a fixed baryonic mass , @xmath36 .",
    "this canonical value corresponds to the measured gravitational masses , @xmath37 , of neutron stars in binary systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as can be inferred by comparing the lpns models lpns@xmath38 , lpns@xmath39 , and lpns@xmath40 with the model lpns@xmath41 ( see sect .  [ sec22 ] ) , the location of the neutrino sphere has nearly no effect on the gravitational mass and the central density .",
    "however , the circumferential radius and the kepler frequency vary by up to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .    the use of an isothermal , instead of an isentropic , eos in the envelope of the hns models hns@xmath44 and hns@xmath45 has only small effects on the properties of the hns s ( see table [ neutrinosphere ] ) . if thermal effects in the envelope are however neglected ( models hns@xmath46 and hns@xmath47 ) , the circumferential radius is reduced by @xmath48 .",
    "this yields to an increase of the kepler frequency by @xmath49 .",
    "though the assumption of zero temperature in the envelope does not change the resulting mass and central densities , the error made in the circumferential radius and in the kepler frequency might be rather large .",
    "the aim of this paper was the investigation of the properties of rapidly rotating pns s consisting of nuclear matter ( n , p , e@xmath50 , @xmath51 ) under the influence of trapped neutrinos .",
    "we used a recently developed nuclear eos for hot , dense matter in the nuclear thomas - fermi approach @xcite .",
    "the nuclear eos was extended in this paper to subnuclear densities and to different compositions of pns and hns matter ( i.e. trapped neutrinos , constant entropy per baryon , @xmath52 ) .",
    "our results for subnuclear densities are comparable to the results derived by @xcite used in the investigations of @xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , considerable deviations occur at densities around and above nuclear matter density , since the eos of @xcite shows a smaller temperature dependence . in general ,",
    "this difference to our results has only a small impact on the properties of pns s , but impacts on hns s with canonical mass .",
    "the impact becomes considerable for more massive stars .",
    "an investigation of this kind should investigate the properties of pns s and hns s for the whole range of possible masses .",
    "so far lepton concentration profiles and entropy per baryon profiles were derived only for one fixed mass in simulations of pns evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our calculation , the extension to the whole range of masses was done by assuming that the lepton concentration and the entropy per baryon does not depend on the mass of the pns .    as a result",
    "we find that the minimum gravitational mass of a ns is determined at the earliest stage of a pns , so that the mass of a ns formed in a type - ii supernova is larger than 0.89 - 1.13@xmath34 , which confirms similar results of a recent investigation by @xcite .",
    "the exact lower limit of the ns mass depends on the used entropy per baryon in the epns model .",
    "the quoted mass range was obtained by using @xmath53 and @xmath54 as lower and upper limit of the entropy per baryon in the envelope of the epns @xcite .",
    "the minimum mass of epns s is approximately by a factor of ten larger than the minimum stable mass of cns s .",
    "the maximum possible baryonic mass of a cns is always larger than the maximum possible baryonic mass of the pns s , this means that once a pns was formed , it can not collapse into a black hole , if further accretion is neglected ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one exception is the case of the most massive stars rotating near or at its kepler frequency , which possibly collapse to a black hole during their time evolution , for a discussion , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this statement holds for stars with a pure nucleonic / leptonic composition . if one includes hyperons and/or quarks , the maximum baryonic mass of a cns decreases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may be smaller than the maximum baryonic mass of a pns . then , a sufficiently massive pns may collapse to a black hole during deloptonization @xcite .",
    "the maximum gravitational mass increases slightly with increasing entropy per baryon in contrast to the maximum baryonic mass ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as it was pointed out , @xcite got a different result due to the use of the eos derived by @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the influence of rotation has several impacts on properties of pns s and ns s .",
    "whereas the minimum mass changes only slightly due to rotation , the effect on the maximum mass is rather large , particularly for cns s .",
    "the central baryon density is nearly unaffected by rotation at the early stages of the evolution , whereas the impact on the the later stages is rather large .",
    "the effect on the circumferential radius decreases with increasing mass and the impact on epns s and lpns s is slightly larger than the impact on cns s .",
    "we investigated the influence of different shapes of the neutrino sphere on the structure of lpns s .",
    "as expected , we obtained considerable differences ( up to 10% ) in the circumferential radii and , due to this , in the kepler frequency .",
    "other properties , as the central density , are barely changed by the location of the neutrino sphere . we have also considered different temperatures in the envelope of lpns s and hns s . if a very high temperature of 0.6 mev is used in the envelope instead of a constant entropy per baryon , the gross properties of the lpns change by less than 1% .",
    "larger deviations were obtained if the envelope is assumed to be cold .",
    "the finite temperature effects should therefore not be neglected in the envelope .",
    "furthermore , we obtain that the thermal effects are comparable to the effects due to trapped neutrinos .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of @xcite , who found the thermal effects to be much smaller than the effect of high lepton numbers .",
    "in our model we assumed that accretion onto the emerging ns stopped after the formation of the epns ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , we kept the angular momentum constant during the deleptonization and the thermal cooling period . under these presumptions , we obtain a lower limit on the periods of young ns s with a typical baryonic mass of 1.5 @xmath34 between 1.56 and 2.22ms , which is in accordance with similar values obtained by @xcite .",
    "these results support strongly the hypothesis that millisecond pulsars were accelerated due to accretion . with the same reasoning ,",
    "one obtains an upper limit of the stability parameter @xmath55 , which is smaller , for almost all ns s , than the critical value for the onset of dynamical and secular instabilities .",
    "kepler rotating massive cns s possess stability parameter values up to @xmath56 and might therefore be secular unstable against @xmath57 and @xmath58 non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "though we have assumed uniform rotation , it seems to be very reasonable that pns s and young ns s rotate differentially ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as it was found by @xcite and @xcite , differential rotation may considerably effect the structure of pns s and ns s , and we will pursue our investigations to differential rotation in the future . another issue that will be addressed in a future work is the effect of additional degrees of freedom ( e.g. hyperons ) on the evolution of pns s .",
