    "[ sec1 ] the realization of mixtures of trapped ultracold atomic gases  @xcite has opened new paths towards the formation of ultracold diatomic molecules  @xcite , quantum - state control of chemical reactions  @xcite , prospects for quantum computing with polar molecules  @xcite , tests of fundamental symmetries  @xcite and studies of fundamental aspects of correlated many - body systems  @xcite , and dilute quantum degenerate systems  @xcite .",
    "co - trapped diamagnetic - paramagnetic mixtures have also made possible experimental realization of interspecies feshbach resonances  @xcite , two - species bose - einstein condensates and mixed bose - fermi and fermi - fermi degenerate gases  @xcite .    in an optical lattice",
    ", atoms can be trapped in the intensity maxima or minima of the light field by the optical dipole force  @xcite .",
    "this force arises from the dispersive interaction of the induced atomic dipole moment with the intensity gradient of the light field , and is proportional to the ac polarizability of the atom .",
    "when its ac polarizability vanishes , as can happen at certain wavelengths , an atom experiences no dipole force and thus is unaffected by the presence of an optical lattice .",
    "our present work provides accurate predictions of the `` magic - zero wavelengths '' @xmath0 which lead to zero stark shifts for alkali - metal atoms .",
    "these wavelengths have also been designated as `` tune - out wavelengths '' by leblanc and thywissen @xcite .",
    "we suggest some possible uses for such wavelengths , all of which take advantage of the fact ( demonstrated below ) , that magic - zero wavelengths are highly dependent upon atomic species and state . for a given atomic species and state",
    "a , let @xmath1 designate an optical lattice or trap made with light at one of the magic - zero wavelengths of a. we start with a model configuration consisting of the gas a embedded in @xmath1 and confined by another trap , t. some process is performed on the gas , after which t is turned off .",
    "members of a will depart and @xmath1 may confine whatever is left .",
    "for example , one might photoassociate some a atoms into dimers during the initial period , and thereby be left with a nearly pure population of dimers trapped in @xmath1 at the end . leblanc and thywissen @xcite have pointed out the advantage of magic - zero wavelengths for traps containing two species .",
    "if another species , b , is added to the model configuration , it will ordinarily be affected by @xmath1 , so b can be moved by shifting @xmath1 , while a remains unaffected .",
    "schemes of this type have been used for entropy transfer and controlled collisions between @xmath2rb and @xmath3k @xcite . for bichromatic optical lattice schemes , such as those discussed by brickman soderberg , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , it could be useful to incorporate @xmath4 into the model configuration , so as to be able to move a and b completely independently .",
    "in another application , a sr lattice at a @xmath5p@xmath6 magic - zero wavelength was suggested for realization of quantum information processing @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the calculation of frequency - dependent polarizabilities of alkali - metal atoms . in section  [ sec3 ] , we present the magic - zero wavelengths for the alkalis from li to cs and discuss some of their applications .",
    "[ sec2 ]    the background to our approach to calculation of atomic polarizabilities is treated in a recent review article  @xcite . here",
    "we summarize points salient to the present work .",
    "the frequency - dependent scalar polarizability , @xmath7 , of an alkali - metal atom in its ground state @xmath8 may be separated into a contribution from the core electrons , @xmath9 , a core modification due to the valence electron , @xmath10 , and a contribution from the valence electron , @xmath11 .",
    "since core electrons have excitation energies in the far - ultraviolet region of the spectrum , the core polarizability dependends weakly on @xmath12 for the optical frequencies treated here .",
    "therefore , we approximate the core polarizability by its dc value as calculated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite , an approach that has been quite successful in previous applications .",
    "the core polarizability is corrected for pauli blocking of core - valence excitations by introducing an extra term @xmath10 . for consistency , this is also calculated in rpa . therefore , the ground state polarizability may be separated as @xmath13 the valence contribution to the static ac polarizability is calculated using the sum - over - states approach  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the reduced electric - dipole ( e1 ) matrix element . in this equation , @xmath12 is assumed to be at least several linewidths off resonance with the corresponding transitions . unless stated otherwise , we use the conventional system of atomic units , a.u .",
    ", in which @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the reduced planck constant @xmath18 have the numerical value 1 .",
    "polarizability in a.u . has the dimension of volume , and its numerical values presented here are expressed in units of @xmath19 , where @xmath20  nm is the bohr radius .",
    "the atomic units for @xmath21 can be converted to si units via @xmath22  [ hz/(v / m)@xmath23=2.48832@xmath24  [ a.u .",
    "] , where the conversion coefficient is @xmath25 and the planck constant @xmath26 is factored out .",
    ".@xmath27 contributions to the frequency - dependent polarizability of the ground state of rb at @xmath28  nm = 1/(23638.16 @xmath29 ) .",
    "absolute values of electric - dipole matrix elements are expressed in a.u .",
    "( @xmath30 ) , and the corresponding energy differences are expressed in conventional wavenumber units ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ , > \" , ]     we illustrate the cancellation of all contributions to @xmath31 rb polarizability at @xmath0=423.0448  nm in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "since this wavelength is between @xmath32 and @xmath33 resonances , the contributions of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 terms strongly dominate .",
    "however , the contribution from the core is significant ( 11% of the largest valence term ) .",
    "this table shows that @xmath0 is located where the valence contribution to the polarizability cancels the adjusted core contribution , a feature that is common to all the cases treated here .",
    "the zero crossing point is in the close vicinity of the @xmath33 resonance owing to the relative size of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 reduced electric - dipole matrix elements given in the second column of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the @xmath38 matrix elements are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath39 matrix elements .",
    "since polarizability contributions are proportional to the square of the matrix element , the denominators of the @xmath35 terms have to become very small to cancel out the @xmath40 contributions .",
    "this magic - zero wavelength is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where we plot ground - state polarizability of rb atom in a.u . in the vicinity of the @xmath37 resonances .",
    "another zero crossing point shown in the figure is located between @xmath33 and @xmath41 resonances , as expected .",
    "the next magic - zero wavelength will be located close to the @xmath42 resonance since the values of the matrix elements continue to decrease with @xmath43 .",
    "[ sec3 ]    in table  [ tab2 ] , we list the vacuum @xmath0 wavelengths for alkali - metal atoms from li to cs . for convenience of presentation",
    ", we also list the resonant wavelength @xmath44 in vacuum in the relevant range of wavelengths .",
    "we order the lists of the resonant wavelengths and @xmath0 to indicate the respective placements of @xmath0 and their distances from resonances .",
    "the resonant vacuum wavelength values are obtained from energy levels from national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) database  @xcite with the exception of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 transition wavelengths for @xmath47li and @xmath48li that are taken from recent measurements @xcite .",
    "since alkali ground states have electric dipole transitions only to @xmath49 states , their polarizabilities will cross zero only between two @xmath50 resonances .",
    "we set the wavelength of the @xmath51 resonance as a lower wavelength bound for our search .",
    "the fine structure of the @xmath52 level is sufficiently small for all alkalis to make the zero point between @xmath51 and @xmath53 relatively difficult to use in practice , so we do not list it .",
    "we omit the @xmath0 between @xmath54 resonances for the same reason .",
    "the wavelengths of the next zero - crossing near the @xmath55 resonances are in the ultraviolet , and not as readily accessible in most laboratories , so we have not calculated them .",
    "however , this would be a routine matter for future work .",
    "there are no @xmath0 at wavelengths greater than those of the primary @xmath56 resonances . within these constraints , we have found four @xmath0 for na , k , rb , and cs and three @xmath0 for li , as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the stated uncertainties in the @xmath0 values are taken to be the maximum difference between the central value and the crossing of the @xmath57 with zero , where @xmath58 is the uncertainty in the ground state polarizability value at that wavelength .",
    "the uncertainties in the values of polarizabilities are obtained by adding uncertainties in the individual polarizability contributions in quadrature .",
    "we find small but significant differences in the first magic wavelengths of @xmath47li and @xmath48li due to the isotope shift .",
    "these values refer to the centers of gravity of all hyperfine states and do not take into account the hyperfine structure .",
    "therefore , this @xmath0 and the corresponding @xmath59 resonance wavelengths are listed separately .",
    "we verified that isotope shift of the @xmath60 traditions in li does not affect the next magic wavelength , 324.18(6)nm , so we use nist data for the other transitions .",
    "we also investigated possible dependence of the first magic - zero wavelengths on the isotope shift for @xmath61k , @xmath62k , @xmath3k and @xmath63rb , @xmath2rb .",
    "the d1 ( @xmath64 ) and d2 ( @xmath65 ) line wavelengths for @xmath61k , @xmath62k , and @xmath3k have been measured using a femtosecond laser frequency comb by falke _",
    "we carry out three calculations of the first magic - zero wavelength using d1 , d2 wavelengths for the specific isotope in our calculations .",
    "the resulting value for @xmath61k and @xmath62k , 768.971(3)nm , is the same as the value quoted in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the @xmath3k value is 768.970(3)nm , with the difference being well below our quoted uncertainty .",
    "the calculations of the first magic wavelength in rb using d1 and d2 frequencies for @xmath63rb and @xmath2rb listed in @xcite gave results identical to result from table  [ tab2 ] , 790.034(7)nm that was obtained using nist data .",
    "we note that our values for the first magic wavelengths are in good agreement with leblanc and thywissen @xcite calculations with the exception of their value for @xmath62k .    the first magic - zero wavelength in rb has been measured to be 789.85(1)nm in @xcite .",
    "some discrepancy with our result is most likely due to approximate linear polarization of the beam in @xcite .",
    "the difference is compatible with a shift in the magic zero wavelength caused by few percent spurious @xmath66 polarization component @xcite .",
    "below , we identify two main applications of magic - zero wavelengths .",
    "first , these wavelengths are advantageous for cooling of group - ii and other more complicated atoms , by sympathetic cooling using an accompanying alkali atom .",
    "recently , group ii atoms have been the subject of various experiments and proposals in atomic clock research and quantum information .",
    "bec of @xmath67sr has been reported recently by two groups @xcite .",
    "the element yb has four boson and two fermion isotopes , all of which have been cooled into the microkelvin range .",
    "several exciting new prospects for quantum information processing with the ground state nuclear spin have recently been identified in group ii elements @xcite .",
    "also , sr or yb are useful for polarized mixtures of fermions , or bose - fermi mixtures , where isotopic mixtures can be studied .",
    "more complex systems have become of interest in the development of frequency standards and quantum information processing schemes .",
    "for example , the rare earth holmium is a candidate for quantum information applications @xcite due to its rich ground - state hyperfine structure .",
    "erbium has been a subject of recent experimental work @xcite , stimulated by its possible use in a variety of applications , including narrow linewidth laser cooling and spectroscopy , unique collision studies , and degenerate bosonic and fermionic gases with long - range magnetic dipole coupling .",
    "some species , particularly fermions , are difficult to cool by themselves due to unfavorable ultracold collisional dynamics . in such cases , it may be possible to use sympathetic cooling in a mixture of the target species and one of the alkalis , where the alkali - metal atom is cooled directly by standard techniques .",
    "this has recently been demonstrated in yb : rb mixtures @xcite .",
    "use of @xmath0 trap wavelengths could allow one to release alkali atoms after the target atoms of the other species are sufficiently cold , in a hybrid trap configuration that combines optical and magnetic traps or bichromatic optical traps .",
    "if the final trap configuration utilizes a @xmath0 wavelength , strong trapping of the target atom is possible while alkali atoms will be released by turning off its separate trapping potential . since placement of the resonances varies significantly among the alkali - metal atoms , a wide range of @xmath0 is available as shown in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "we list the resonant wavelengths for variety of atomic systems in table  [ tab3 ] . for consistency with the other tables , we list vacuum wavelengths obtained from the nist energy levels database  @xcite . comparing tables  [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] yields many instances of resonant transitions that are very close to @xmath0 . here",
    "are few of the very close cases : mg  285.3 - na  285.6 , sr  460.9 - cs  460.2 , dy  421.3 - rb  421.1 , ho  598.5 - na  589.6 .",
    "magic - zero wavelength laser light may be also useful in three - species cooling schemes such as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite by allowing easy release of one of the species from the trap . the work @xcite demonstrated that the efficiency of sympathetic cooling of the @xmath47li gas by @xmath2rb was increased by the presence of @xmath62k through catalytic cooling",
    ".    measurements of the magic - zero wavelengths may be used as high - precision benchmark tests of theory and determination of the excited - state matrix elements that are difficult to measure by other methods .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath50 transitions of alkali - metal atoms , where @xmath68 is the ground state , are difficult to calculate accurately owing to large correlation corrections and small values of the final numbers .",
    "experimental measurements of the @xmath69 predicted in this work will serve an an excellent benchmark test of the all - order calculations .",
    "moreover , it will be possible to combine these measurements with theoretical calculations to infer the values of these small matrix elements .",
    "only one high - precision measurement of such matrix elements ( @xmath70 transitions in cs ) has been carried out to date  @xcite .",
    "[ sec4 ] in summary , we calculate magic - zero wavelengths in alkali - metal atoms from li to cs and estimate their uncertainties",
    ". applications of these magic wavelengths to sympathetic cooling of group - ii and other more complicated atoms with alkalis are discussed .",
    "special cases where these wavelengths coincide with strong resonance transition in group - ii atoms , yb , dy , ho , and er are identified .",
    "measurements of the magic - zero wavelengths for benchmark tests of theory and experiment are proposed .",
    "this research was performed under the sponsorship of the us department of commerce , national institute of standards and technology , and was supported by the national science foundation under physics frontiers center grant phy-0822671 .",
