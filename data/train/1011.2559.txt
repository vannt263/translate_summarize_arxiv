    "lasrcoruo@xmath10 is a double perovskite whose magnetic properties critically depend on cationic order , charge balance and complex magnetic interactions between two transition metal ions @xcite .",
    "its crystal structure is composed of corner - shared coo@xmath10 and ruo@xmath10 octahedra arranged in a pseudocubic array in the rocksalt arrangement .",
    "it is a semiconductor with ideal valence states hs co@xmath6 ( 3d@xmath11 high - spin configuration ) and ru@xmath9 ( 4d@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "magnetically these compounds are reported to be antiferromagnetic with two magnetic face centered cubic ( fcc ) sublattices consisting of co and ru .",
    "both the sublattices order with type ii antiferromagnetic structure which would mean that the spins in [ 111 ] planes in succession co - ru - co - ru alternate as + /+/-/ - .",
    "this marginalizes the co - o - ru nearest neighbor interactions and the ordering is governed by a competition between linear co - o - ru - o - co and 90@xmath13 co - o - o - co antiferromagnetic exchange paths @xcite .",
    "the degree of ordering is known to affect the magnetic and transport properties due to changes in magnetic interactions and in cationic valence .",
    "effects of anti - site disorder on the magnetic and transport properties due to la or sr doping in lasrcoruo@xmath10 have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the change of composition ( la or sr doping ) introduces mobile electrons in la richer samples or holes in sr richer samples .",
    "another possible way of modifying magnetic and transport properties is by forming the solid solutions of antiferromagnetic lacoo@xmath14 and ferromagnetic srruo@xmath14 .",
    "these perovskite solid solutions of the form sr@xmath15la@xmath16ru@xmath15co@xmath16o@xmath14 will have a strong interplay of cationic order , charge balance and complex magnetic interactions between the two b - site cations . in srruo@xmath14",
    "the @xmath17 electrons of the low spin ru@xmath8 ions occupy the narrow @xmath18 band near fermi level @xcite .",
    "the lower @xmath19 energy levels of co@xmath7 causes a charge transfer from @xmath17 ru@xmath8 to @xmath19 co@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , co can have various electronic states including high spin ( hs ) co@xmath6 , co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 , intermediate spin ( is ) co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 and low spin ( ls ) co@xmath7 and co@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this complicates the situation giving rise properties like localized magnetic moment of co @xcite , negative magnetoresistance @xcite . in case of sr@xmath15la@xmath16ru@xmath15co@xmath16o@xmath14",

    "align themselves in a pseudocubic array in the rocksalt arrangement forming the arch - type `` double perovskite '' structure .",
    "the charge transfer between ru and co in lasrcoruo@xmath10 is very sensitive to local atomic structure such as cation order @xcite .",
    "any disturbance in this cation order leads to compensation of antiferromagnetic interactions by the ferromagnetic interactions most likely associated with ru - o - ru interactions .",
    "the lacoo@xmath20 substituted srruo@xmath20 , has been known to exhibit large local magnetic moment arising due to co spin polarizing the itinerant electrons of srruo@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , the delicate charge balance achieved in solid solutions by conversion of co@xmath7 to co@xmath6 and oxidation ru@xmath8 to ru@xmath9 due to formation of double perovskite structure has not been addressed .",
    "more importantly the magnetic interactions at play as the system transforms from a ferromagnetic ground state to an antiferromagnetic one is far from being clearly understood .",
    "it is with this aim the present investigation is proposed .",
    "this paper describes detailed investigations carried out on the structural , magnetic and transport properties of solid solutions of srruo@xmath14 and lacoo@xmath14 which form double perovskite compounds of the type la@xmath0sr@xmath1co@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 , where 0.25 @xmath21 x @xmath4 0.75 .",
    "polycrystalline samples of la@xmath0sr@xmath1co@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 , @xmath22 were synthesized by solid state reaction method by taking pre - dried stoichiometric amounts of la@xmath23o@xmath20 , srco@xmath20 , co(no@xmath20)@xmath23.6h@xmath23o and ruo@xmath23 .",
    "these starting powders were ground thoroughly , pressed into pellets and heated for a total of 48 hrs , at 1300@xmath13c with three intermediate regrinding steps .",
    "all samples were deemed to be phase pure , as x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) data collected on a rigaku x - ray diffractometer in the range of @xmath24 using cuk@xmath25 radiation showed no impurity reflections .",
    "the diffraction patterns were rietveld refined using fullprof suite and structural parameters were obtained .",
    "dc magnetization ( m ) was measured , both as a function of temperature and magnetic field using the quantum design squid magnetometer ( mpms-5s ) .",
    "magnetization as a function of temperature , m(t ) was measured in an applied field of 50 oe and 1000 oe in the temperature range of 5k to 300k .",
    "the sample was initially cooled from 300k to 5k in zero applied field and the data was recorded while warming up to 300k in the applied magnetic field ( referred to as zfc curve ) and subsequent cooling ( referred to as fc curve ) back to 5k .",
    "magnetization as a function of field was measured under sweep magnetic fields up to @xmath265 t at various temperatures . before each m(h ) was recorded , the sample was warmed to 300k and cooled back to the desired temperature .",
    "neutron diffraction ( nd ) measurements were performed at room temperature ( rt ) and 20k and a wavelength of 1.24   using powder diffractometer at dhruva , trombay .",
    "x - ray photoelectron spectra at co ( 2p ) and ru ( 3d ) levels were recorded using thermo fisher scientific multilab 2000 ( england ) instrument with al k@xmath27 radiation ( 1486.6 ev ) .",

    "it may be mentioned here that the compounds with values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 have pbnm and r@xmath31c structures respectively and hence were not studied as they can not be classified as double perovskites .",
    "rietveld refinement of the xrd patterns were carried out with the p2@xmath28 space group wherein the la / sr occupy the 4e site with the fractional coordinates ( 0.00125,0.00774 , 0.2463 ) , co is at 2c ( 0.5 , 0 , 0.5 ) , ru is at 2d ( 0.5 , 0 , 0 ) and the oxygen atoms occupy three sites , viz,(0.2491 , 0.2566 , 0.0295 ) ; ( 0.2207 , -0.2233 , 0.0295 ) and ( -0.06418 , 0.4995 , 0.2507 ) .",
    "the scale factor , back ground parameters , cell parameters , co and ru site occupancies along with instrumental broadening , totalling 17 parameters were refined in that order to obtain a good fit .",
    "as can be seen from table [ as ] the b - site disorder was found to be least for @xmath5 = 0.5 which also happens to be the stoichiometric double perovskite lasrcoruo@xmath10 .",
    "interestingly the disorder or the deviation from expected occupancy is highest for @xmath5 = 0.4 and 0.6 .",
    "this aspect needs more attention and perhaps magnetic and transport properties will shed light on this .",
    "the crystallographic parameters obtained from the above refinements along with the curie - weiss parameters calculated from magnetization measurements are all summarized in table [ riet ] .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     magnetization measurements performed in applied fields of 1000 oe and 50 oe during the zfc and fc cycles for @xmath5 = 0.25 , 0.4 , 0.6 and 0.75 samples are presented in fig .",
    "[ seriesiimt ] . in the case of @xmath5",
    "= 0.25 , 0.4 and 0.6 there is a wide difference in magnetization recorded during the zfc and fc cycles .",
    "the zfc magnetization for these three samples , with increasing temperature increases sharply culminating into a broad hump centered around 50k .",
    "it decreases slightly with further rise in temperature before increasing sharply resulting in a peak at about 150k .",
    "the fc magnetization , on the other hand decreases continuously to about 167k and then settles down into a low value giving an impression of a ferro to para transition .",
    "the wide difference in the magnetization between the zfc and fc cycle indicates a complex magnetic ground state .",
    "it may also be noted that the magnetization ( emu / mole ) value at 5k decreases with increasing la and co content .",
    "further with increasing @xmath5 the irreversibility between the zfc and fc curves is also seen to decrease until at @xmath5 = 0.75 . for this composition",
    "there is a very little difference between zfc and fc magnetization curves and the sample seems to order antiferromagnetically at t@xmath32 = 34 k.    the low field magnetization measurements are also in agreement with the above .",
    "the interesting point however is the observation of negative values of magnetization for three compositions viz , @xmath5 = 0.25 , 0.4 and 0.75 during zfc cycle .",
    "such negative values of magnetization were also seen in case of thermally disordered lasrcoruo@xmath10 @xcite . it may be noted here that all precautions were taken to ensure that negative values of magnetization are not due to remanent field of superconducting magnet of the squid magnetometer and this procedure has been described earlier @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as has been described later , the initial magnetization curves recorded for these samples at 5k also exhibit negative magnetization for lower values of field ( see insets of fig .",
    "[ seriesiimh ] ) . in case of @xmath5 = 0.75 however , the magnetization was all along positive even during the zfc cycle .",
    "the negative magnetization could be ascribed to presence of two magnetic sub - lattices which order in such a way as to cancel the magnetization of each other and in low fields align the net magnetic moment in a direction opposite to the applied field .",
    "the two magnetic sublattices could be conjunctured to be ferromagnetic ru@xmath8-o - ru@xmath8 and antiferromagnetic co@xmath6-o - ru@xmath9 and/or co@xmath7-o - co@xmath7",
    ".    this fact will be more clear from the values of effective paramagnetic moment @xmath33 and curie - weiss temperature @xmath34 obtained from the high temperature magnetization behaviour .",
    "curie - weiss analysis has been employed to examine the behaviour of high temperature magnetization .",
    "the plots of the inverse susceptibility ( 1/@xmath35 = h / m ) versus temperature are presented in fig [ suscp ] . for x = 0.75 , the inverse susceptibility appears to vary linearly with temperature in the range 40k @xmath36 t @xmath36 300k but a curie - weiss fit to the data indicates that there is a deviation from the linear fit below 160k .",
    "this is a characteristic progressive suppression of the spin - spin interactions as temperature decreases due to spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order below 34k can then be attributed to ordering of co spins via non - magnetic ruo@xmath37 bridges @xcite .",
    "therefore the data in the range 180k @xmath36 t @xmath36 300k was fitted to the curie - weiss law and the values of @xmath38 and @xmath34 were obtained .",
    "likewise for all the other compounds too curie - weiss fitting was performed in the high temperature range ( 180k to 300k ) and @xmath38 and @xmath34 were calculated .",
    "these parameters are listed in table [ riet ] .",
    "it can be seen that while the @xmath38 varies only in a small range between 3.44 to 3.87 @xmath39 , @xmath34 shows a parabolic variation with @xmath5 and changes its sign from negative for co rich compounds to positive for ru rich compositions .",
    "negative @xmath34 indicates presence of stronger antiferromagnetic interactions while positive @xmath34 means stronger ferromagnetic interactions . in case of @xmath5",
    "= 0.5 , the @xmath38 value agrees very well with the calculated spin only moment value of co@xmath6 and ru@xmath9 indicating formation of a well ordered double perovskite .",
    "another point to be noted is very large negative value of @xmath34 .",
    "this is an indicator of strong antiferromagnetic interactions and indeed this compound is reported to order antiferromagnetically at @xmath40 = 80k @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "the ru rich compositions obviously have higher amount of ru@xmath8/ru@xmath9 leading to stronger ferromagnetic interactions and positive @xmath34 while the co rich compounds have stronger antiferromagnetic interactions arising from higher amounts of co@xmath6/co@xmath7 ions .",
    "however , for all these compositions , @xmath38 values reported in table [ riet ] can only be obtained by considering the presence of ru@xmath8/ru@xmath9 and co@xmath6/co@xmath7 redox couples . even in case of @xmath5 = 0.75 small deviation between zfc and fc curves",
    "is seen below 160k ( see fig . [ seriesiimt ] ) .",
    "the presence of these magnetic ions results in formation of more than one magnetic sublattices giving rise to complex magnetic behaviour .    to establish the nature of magnetic order ,",
    "nd patterns were recorded at low temperature ( 20k ) and 300k for the two end members @xmath5 = 0.75 and 0.25 .",
    "the rietveld refined nd patterns at 300k for both these compounds are presented in fig .",
    "the parameters obtained from rietveld refinement agree well with those obtained from xrd studies . the low temperature ( 20k ) data shown in limited range in fig .",
    "[ nd ] indicates extra superlattice reflections due to antiferromagnetic ordering in @xmath5 = 0.75 .",
    "these reflections can be accounted for by an antiferromagnetic alignment of co and ru spins with a propagation vector along the @xmath41 with respect to crystallographic axis .",
    "the magnetic arrangement is the same as determined for @xmath5 = 0.5 in ref .",
    "@xcite . as per this model ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic alignment is of type ii which means that antiparallel spins are related by ( @xmath42 ) translation operation .",
    "the refined spin moments for ru and co which were taken to be equal , were @xmath43 = 0.67(3)@xmath39 , @xmath44 = 0.36(6)@xmath39 and resultant @xmath45 = 0.69(2)@xmath39 .",
    "no long range magnetic order is visible in case of ru rich composition ( @xmath5 = 0.25 ) indicating that the sharp rise in magnetization at about 160k is due to short range ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the short range ferromagnetic correlations could be due to ru - o - ru linkages intervened by co ions .",
    "these ferromagnetic correlations are present along with antiferromagnetic interactions as evidenced by the wide separation between zfc and fc curves for this sample .",
    "a further confirmation of the presence of competing magnetic interactions is obtained from isothermal magnetic response recorded for all the samples at various temperatures in the field range of @xmath2650koe .",
    "[ seriesiimh ] presents the isothermal magnetization curves for four samples ( @xmath5 = 0.25 , 0.4 , 0.6 and 0,75 ) at 5k .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that for @xmath5 = 0.75 , the magnetization exhibits a strong field dependency and almost no hysteresis which is typical of an antiferromagnet .",
    "this is in agreement with antiferromagnetic ordering seen in m v / s t and nd measurements . on the other hand for all other compositions the isothermal magnetization exhibits a clear ferromagnetic hysteresis loop that rides on an antiferromagnetic ( linear ) background .",
    "therefore the observed magnetic behavior can be ascribed to the presence of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "it is also be noticed that with increase in ru content , the area under the hysteresis loop increases implying the strengthening of ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the initial magnetization curves shown as insets in fig .",
    "[ seriesiimh ] make it clear that the negative magnetization seen in the low field zfc curves is indeed an intrinsic property of the materials studied here .",
    "further it can also be seen that with the increase in @xmath5 , magnetization turns positive at lower and lower values of applied field .",
    "presence of co@xmath46 and ru@xmath47 redox couples that give rise to complex magnetic behaviour will also affect the transport properties of the compounds .",
    "it may be mentioned here that while srruo@xmath14 has metallic conductivity @xcite , lacoo@xmath14 exhibits semiconducting behaviour at temperatures below 300k @xcite . a plot of @xmath48 versus temperature for la@xmath0sr@xmath1co@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath49",
    "is presented in fig.[seriesiirest ] .",
    "all the samples show semiconducting behaviour . it may be noted that the ordered composition ( @xmath5 = 0.5 ) has the highest magnitude of resistivity due to absence of any ru - o - ru type conducting paths . since the resistivity of this ordered sample follows mott s variable range hopping ( vrh ) behaviour , @xmath50 versus t@xmath51 has been plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ seriesiirest ] for all compositions .",
    "it can be seen that along with @xmath5 = 0.5 , @xmath5 = 0.25 and 0.75 samples show a linear behaviour indicating conduction to be in accordance with mott s vrh law .",
    "resistivity behaviour for @xmath5 = 0.4 and 0.6 compounds however , is quite different . here",
    "the @xmath48 varies in a very narrow range and exhibits a hump at about 160k which coincides with the sharp rise in magnetization data of these samples .",
    "rietveld analysis have also shown maximum b - site occupancy disorder for the same two compositions and therefore could be linked to the presence of more number of ru - o - ru conducting paths .",
    "all the above properties hint at presence of co@xmath6/co@xmath7 and ru@xmath8/ru@xmath9 pairs in la@xmath0sr@xmath1co@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath10 compounds in different proportion .",
    "core level xps of co and ru can give an indication of valency of these ions and therefore a measure of such proportion .",
    "fig [ xps ] presents the background subtracted co and ru core level spectra for @xmath5 = 0.25 , 0.5 and 0.75 . both co @xmath52 and ru @xmath53 spectra show two clear peaks due to spin orbit splitting and the associated satellite peaks ( marked as * ) . in the case of co ,",
    "the main peaks are separated by a spin orbit splitting of about 15ev while in the case of ru this splitting is about 22ev @xcite . in the case of @xmath5",
    "= 0.25 and 0.75 , the main peaks are broadened as compared to @xmath5 = 0.5 and show considerable spectral weight on the higher energy side especially in case of co @xmath52 .",
    "therefore the spectra have been fitted with two gaussians perhaps corresponding to co@xmath6 and co@xmath7 species .",
    "likewise the ru @xmath53 spectra also shows a presence of two types of ru ions which are most likely to be ru@xmath8 and ru@xmath9 species . in case of @xmath5",
    "= 0.5 , co @xmath52 and ru @xmath53 spectra can be well represented by a single gaussian which can be attributed to divalent co and pentavalent ru respectively .",
    "further in case of @xmath5 = 0.25 which has majority ru content , the intensity of the peak corresponding to ru@xmath8 is higher than that of the peak corresponding to ru@xmath9 while the @xmath5 = 0.75 sample shows higher amounts of co@xmath7 species as compared to co@xmath6 .",
    "this is as expected , the unexpected however is the corresponding contents of co@xmath6/co@xmath7 in @xmath5 = 0.25 and ru@xmath8/ru@xmath9 in @xmath5 = 0.75 .",
    "using the percentage concentration ratios of co@xmath6/co@xmath7 and ru@xmath8/ru@xmath9 obtained from area under the respective gaussian s an attempt was made to calculate the spin only magnetic moments for the two compositions .",
    "the calculations were made assuming s = 3/2 for co@xmath6 and ru@xmath9 , s = 1 for co@xmath7 and s = 2 for ru@xmath8 .",
    "the calculated values were found to be @xmath54 in case of @xmath5 = 0.75 and @xmath55 in case of @xmath5 = 0.25 . although slightly lower , they seem to agree with the trend reported in table [ riet ] .",
    "in the case of ordered double perovskite , lasrcoruo@xmath10 , the presence of highly acidic ru@xmath9 stabilizes the high spin co@xmath6 and thereby suppressing various electronic transitions that co ion can have . however , when the order is disturbed , co - o - co and ru - o - ru linkages are formed and the trivalent state of co and tetravalent state of ru are favoured .",
    "such has been the case in la@xmath56sr@xmath57coruo@xmath10 @xcite .    in la@xmath0sr@xmath1co@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "present studies indicate that with the addition of lacoo@xmath14 to srruo@xmath14 leads to stabilization of double perovskite phase is seen in a broad concentration region of @xmath58 .",
    "these double perovskites , apart from co@xmath6-o - ru@xmath9 interactions will also contain co - o - co and ru - o - ru linkages .",
    "this is amply clear from the magnetic and transport properties described above . as mentioned above",
    ", these linkages favour trivalent and tetravalent states for co and ru respectively .",
    "further , under such conditions it is well known that hs and is states of co@xmath7 are promoted @xcite .",
    "presence of hs / is co@xmath7 ions will give rise to additional magnetic interactions . further ru@xmath8-o - ru@xmath8 is known to be ferromagnetic and metallic in conduction @xcite .",
    "the observed competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions can be therefore attributed to presence of ru@xmath8 and co@xmath7 ions .",
    "the presence of these ions along with occupancy disorder leads to formation of ru rich and co rich magnetic sublattices which order ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically respectively .",
    "this is well supported by the decrease in magnetization values with increasing co content and sharper rise of magnetization in case of ru rich compositions .",
    "only when there is a complete ordering of the b - site cations , co@xmath6 and ru@xmath9 ions are stabilized as nearest neighbours and long range antiferromagnetic order is established . the antiferromagnetic order seen in @xmath5 = 0.75",
    "can be attributed to antiferromagnetic cobalt ordering via non - magnetic ruo@xmath59 bridges @xcite .",
    "the presence of more than one magnetic sublattices also explains the negative magnetization observed in zfc cycle of low field magnetization data .",
    "the ferromagnetic sublattice formed due to presence of tetravalent ru ions orders at around 160k .",
    "this polarizes the paramagnetic co spins in a direction opposite to the applied field leading to magnetic compensation and negative values of magnetization . with a decrease in ru content ,",
    "the ferromagnetic sublattice becomes weaker and the field required to reverse the magnetization to positive values also decreases .",
    "this can be very clearly seen from the initial magnetization curves presented in fig .",
    "[ seriesiimh ] .",
    "in summary , the structural , transport and magnetic properties in la@xmath0sr@xmath1co@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 have been studied .",
    "double perovskite structure with space group p2@xmath28 is stabilized over a wide composition range from @xmath5 = 0.25 to 0.75 . with the increase in co content ,",
    "ferromagnetic interactions are found to weaken and at @xmath5 = 0.75 the compound orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath40 = 34k .",
    "this interplay of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions is attributed to presence of ru@xmath8/ru@xmath9 and co@xmath6/co@xmath7 redox couple in all the compounds .",
    "the only exception to this is the ordered compound @xmath5 = 0.5 wherein co and ru exist in divalent and pentavalent states respectively representing an archtype double perovskite .",
    "the presence of different magnetic sublattices leads to magnetic compensation and negative magnetization .",
    "this can be explained by polarization of paramagnetic co spins by the ferromagnetic ru@xmath8 sublattice in a direction opposite to applied field .",
