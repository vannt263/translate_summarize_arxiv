    "in 1957 bardeen , cooper and schrieffer  @xcite provided , at a stroke , the essentials of a complete theory of the phenomenon of superconductivity as it was known then and for the next thirty years .",
    "however since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials  @xcite it has been generally , although not universally , believed that a new mechanism is operating in these systems .",
    "it was established early on that one key element of the bcs mechanism , electron pairing , remains.@xcite however there is mounting evidence that the symmetry of the pairs is @xmath2  @xcite rather than @xmath9-wave and this suggests an electronic mechanism for pairing rather than the original bcs phonon - mediated one .    the common element in all the cuprate superconductors is the @xmath10 plane in which the @xmath11 atoms form a square lattice with an @xmath12 atom at the midpoint of each pair of nearest - neighbour @xmath11 atoms . in the simplest case of @xmath13 , with the assumption of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ions , the @xmath11 charge is 2 + corresponding to a @xmath16 configuration . in the presence of crystal field splitting one expects doubly occupied @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals and a singly - occupied @xmath2 orbital . in the absence of interaction between the electrons the undoped system @xmath21 would therefore be a metal whereas it is observed to be an antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of strong repulsive coulomb interaction on the @xmath11 site which tends to localize the @xmath22 electrons and produces a mott insulator . in the doped system @xmath23 , where @xmath14 ions are replaced by @xmath24 , the nominal occupation of the @xmath25 @xmath11 orbital",
    "is reduced to @xmath26 and with @xmath27 the system is metallic and superconducting with @xmath28k .",
    "anderson  @xcite was the first to propose that the essence of high temperature superconductivity is contained in the two dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice hubbard model  @xcite with repulsive on - site interaction @xmath29 .",
    "the atomic orbital in the model may be regarded as a @xmath11 @xmath2 orbital hybridized with @xmath12 @xmath30 and @xmath31 orbitals on neighbouring sites.@xcite in his recent work anderson  @xcite attributes the existence of superconductivity to electron transfer @xmath10 planes .",
    "he proposes that electrons in the @xmath10 plane separate into uncharged spinons and charged holons , as they do in the dimensional hubbard model , where the electrons form a luttinger liquid .",
    "this spin - charge separation inhibits the transfer of unpaired electrons between planes , but in anderson s theory this constraint is removed upon pairing .",
    "the resultant decrease in total kinetic energy favours pairing and drives superconductivity .",
    "a difficulty with anderson s theory is the absence of convincing evidence for spin - charge separation in two dimensions .    from the experimental point of view",
    "it is true that the critical temperature @xmath3 tends to increase with the number of adjacent @xmath10 planes , although @xmath32 with rather isolated @xmath10 planes has @xmath33k.@xcite some interplanar interaction is presumably essential to stabilize superconductivity at finite @xmath34 even when the primary mechanism , which sets the scale of the resultant @xmath3 , operates within a plane .",
    "an analogous situation is a quasi-2d ferromagnet without magnetic anisotropy in which the scale of the curie temperature is set by in - plane exchange interaction , although weak interplanar exchange is required to stabilize ferromagnetism at finite @xmath34 .",
    "an in - plane mechanism which is advocated by pines and co - workers , @xcite scalapino,@xcite and moriya@xcite is based on electron pairing due to exchange of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "this type interaction leads inevitably to @xmath2 pairing and much of the experimental evidence cited in its favour is evidence for @xmath2 pairing rather than for the spin fluctuation mechanism itself . in this paper",
    "we show how @xmath2 pairing arises in the 2d hubbard model in a way which is not obviously related to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , although antiferromagnetic correlations between neighbouring sites are clearly present .",
    "the spin fluctuation mechanism has been strongly criticized by anderson,@xcite who emphasizes the heuristic nature of pines s model .",
    "the published ab initio monte carlo calculations on the 2d hubbard model have not produced any evidence of superconductivity.@xcite however for the small finite size systems considered the electron density can not be varied continuously and it is possible that the favourable case of optimal doping is missed .",
    "very recently husslein _",
    "et al._@xcite have addressed this question by implementing projector monte carlo calculations for the 2d hubbard model with nearest and next - nearest neighbour hopping parameters @xmath35 .",
    "this work was motivated by the ` van hove scenario '  @xcite in which , given a suitable interaction between electrons , a high @xmath3 may emerge from the large density of states at the van hove singularity associated with saddle - points in the band structure . to model a particular system @xmath36 is tuned so that for optimal doping , i.e. with a convenient electron density close to that with the highest observed @xmath3 , the singularity occurs at the fermi energy . in earlier work  @xcite on the ` van hove scenario ' explicitly attractive electron interactions , such as the phonon mediated one , were considered and consequently the pairing was @xmath9-wave .",
    "the remarkable result of the new monte carlo calculations  @xcite is that @xmath2 pairing emerges in the repulsive @xmath29 hubbard model , but only when , for a given @xmath36 , the doping level is tuned to within @xmath37% of the optimum one .",
    "it is clear why superconductivity was missed in earlier monte carlo calculations .",
    "the new monte carlo results provide very satisfying confirmation of some of the results reported in this paper , which are obtained by a more analytical green s function method",
    ". we will show how a combination of on - site electron repulsion and the band structure saddle - point leads to @xmath2 pairing and a fairly high @xmath3 .",
    "our approach gives a unified theory of quasiparticles in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "a slight surprise about the work of husslein _ _ et al_. _",
    "@xcite is that their modest interaction strength @xmath38 leads to sufficient correlation to give the effect .",

    "the details are given in roth s",
    "paper.@xcite    thus to investigate the normal state of the 2d hubbard model we follow precisely the method roth  @xcite originally applied to the three dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the use of two operators , @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponds to a two - pole approximation to the green s function .",
    "the resulting green s function therefore consists of two terms , each corresponding to a quasiparticle band : @xmath102 with @xmath103 + @xmath104 and @xmath105 it has been shown that this green s function conserves the first four moments of the spectral density.@xcite the quasiparticle bands @xmath106 and @xmath107 satisfy @xmath108 .",

    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "the agreement with the monte carlo results is remarkable and this is a strong indication that the roth two - pole approximation represents the green s function rather well .",
    "this is reasonable since the spectral functions of bulut _",
    "et al_.@xcite are dominated by two peaks which define the quasiparticle energies for each @xmath111 .",
    "near @xmath112 there is also an additional broad bump at lower energy , but its weight is very small .",
    "one striking feature is the flattening at the top of the lower band around @xmath112 , extending to the saddle - point at @xmath113 and halfway to @xmath114 .",
    "very flat bands have also been observed near the @xmath0 point in recent angular resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments on hole doped cuprate superconductors such as @xmath115 ( bi 2212),@xcite @xmath116 ( bi2201),@xcite @xmath117 ( ybco 124),@xcite and @xmath118 ( ybco 123).@xcite it is clear from our calculations that this feature is associated to a large extent with nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic correlations @xmath119 .",
    "because @xmath120 is by far the most important contributor to @xmath97 for the occupations shown , @xmath97 will be negative , so that @xmath79 decreases with increasing @xmath77 .",
    "this leads to a narrowing and , near the top , a flattening of the lower band .",
    "@xmath120 increases with occupation , so the effect is pronounced when approaching half - filling .",
    "the flattening near the top is also responsible for a clear gap between the upper and lower band , even for @xmath29 no larger than the unperturbed bandwidth .",
    "the densities of states calculated from the one - particle green s function are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : dos ] .",
    "one feature that the quantum monte carlo results appears to share with our results is an anomalous fermi surface volume for @xmath121 . in fig .",
    "[ figure : fs ] we plot the fermi surfaces associated with our calculated bands and the non - interacting bands of fig .",
    "[ figure : bands ] .",
    "it is clear that the volume , or area in two dimensions , of the calculated fermi surface is always larger than the non - interacting one .",
    "since the quantum monte carlo bands agree well with ours along symmetry lines , the corresponding fermi surfaces may be expected to be similar .",
    "certainly for @xmath122 it seems that the quantum monte carlo data are definitely incompatible with a fermi surface of normal volume .",
    "however , according to luttinger s theorem  @xcite the volume enclosed by the fermi surface of an interacting fermi liquid is equal to that of the non - interacting system .",
    "we would not want to conclude that there is a breakdown of fermi liquid theory on the basis of our own calculations , because , as will be discussed below , the two - pole approximation will always lead to a fermi surface enclosing an enlarged volume when only the lower band is occupied .",
    "but the monte carlo method in principle yields exact results for the model , so the apparent anomalous fermi surface volume must be taken seriously .",
    "it must be remembered however that the quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite were executed at a finite temperature , @xmath123 in this case .",
    "a possibility is that the enlarged fermi surface volume is a temperature effect and that the volume shrinks to its normal volume as @xmath124 , although this means that the form of the fermi surface and the bands would change considerably in the process . in order that the chemical potential moves in the right direction with increasing temperature , the fermi level at @xmath125 would have to lie above the van hove singularity where the density of states has a negative gradient .",
    "thus electron interaction would have produced a strong distortion of the fermi surface which , although conserving the enclosed volume , changes the topology .",
    "another explanation might be that a transition from a fermi liquid to a non - fermi liquid , of the type predicted by edwards and hertz , @xcite is occurring as @xmath126 increases through a critical value @xmath127 . in the edwards - hertz theory , based on a modified hubbard alloy analogy ,",
    "a @xmath125 phase transition occurs at a value of @xmath128 when @xmath29 is larger than the bandwidth .",
    "for @xmath129 we have a normal fermi liquid with a fermi surface of normal volume defined by a finite migdal discontinuity associated with quasiparticles of infinite lifetime .",
    "for @xmath130 there is no migdal discontinuity since all quasiparticles have a finite lifetime , attributed by edwards and hertz to very strong spin disorder scattering .",
    "however clear quasiparticle peaks in the spectral functions still exist , just as in the monte carlo data , and the points in @xmath131 space where they cross the chemical potential define a ` fermi surface ' .",
    "it is found @xcite that for @xmath132 the volume of this fermi surface is enlarged compared with the non - interacting one and spectral functions and quasiparticle bands have been calculated for the 2d hubbard model within the edwards - hertz approach so that a detailed comparison with the monte carlo data can be made .",
    "it is clear on general grounds that , if the ` fermi surface ' volume is indeed anomalous , one would not expect a migdal discontinuity with sharp quasiparticles because this is a vestige of the non - interacting situation and would only occur at a surface of normal volume .",
    "we now return to the present roth approach which can not describe a sharp transition at a critical @xmath127 but which gives a smooth crossover from fermi surfaces of almost normal volume at smaller @xmath126 to enlarged surfaces at @xmath133 closer to 1 .",
    "the major defect of the two - hole approximation is that the quasiparticles , whose energies appear to be given rather accurately , are not subject to any lifetime broadening . the origin of the enlarged fermi surface within this approximation is seen most clearly in the limit of very large @xmath29 where the effect is most pronounced . for @xmath134 the one - electron green s function @xmath95",
    "is easily found from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g11])-([eq : x ] ) to take the form @xmath135 for @xmath136 only the lower band , associated with the pole of the first term , is occupied . since each state in this band",
    "has weight @xmath137 , whereas for a non - interacting case each state has weight @xmath138 , the fermi surface volume is increased relative to the non - interacting one by a factor @xmath139 .",
    "for example if @xmath140 , the enlargement factor is @xmath141 and the fermi surface volume corresponds to a half - filled ( @xmath142 ) non - interacting situation . since @xmath143 depends on @xmath144 only through @xmath145 , as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi12 ] ) that a quasiparticle constant energy surface enclosing a given volume coincides with the non - interacting energy surface enclosing the same volume .",
    "thus , with @xmath134 , for @xmath140 we have the square fermi surface @xmath146 , but for finite @xmath29 , with a less pronounced enlargement factor , the square fermi surface occurs for larger @xmath126 .",
    "the square fermi surface plays an important role in the superconducting state described in the following sections because , for given @xmath29 , optimum doping ( highest @xmath3 ) occurs with the occupation @xmath126 corresponding to the square fermi surface .",
    "this corresponds to having a van hove singularity at the fermi level for some doping and we have argued above that this must be the case at @xmath125 to be consistent with the high temperature monte carlo data . thus even if the anomalous fermi surface of the roth method is spurious we believe the of the fermi surface is described quite well .",
    "we wish to emphasize again the remarkable agreement shown in fig.1 between the quasiparticle bands calculated by the roth two - pole approximation , using precisely her method of evaluating various correlation functions which occur , and those given by the monte carlo calculations of bulut _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "our calculations agree with the monte carlo data not only for the location of the bands , but also for the spectral weight distribution over the two bands .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : weights ] where we show , for several points along the @xmath147 line in the brillouin zone , our two delta functions with weights @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "these weights compare well with the areas under the peaks of the spectral functions found by bulut _",
    "et al_.  @xcite while the spectral weight distribution is dispersionless for @xmath150 , for intermediate @xmath29 ( @xmath109 ) we find a strong dispersion .",
    "we also find that there is a strong weight transfer upon doping from the upper band @xmath151 to the lower band @xmath106 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : weighttransfer ] .",
    "this weight transfer is particularly strong around the ( @xmath152 ) point for intermediate @xmath29 .",
    "a strong weight transfer from high energy scale to low energy scale upon doping has been observed in electron loss experiments  @xcite and optical spectroscopy experiments  @xcite on high temperature cuprate superconductors . applying strong - coupling perturbation theory , eskes _",
    "et al_.  @xcite find a similar weight transfer .",
    "we may mention here that the roth procedure , again followed precisely , also gives a good description of the occurence of ferromagnetism in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "the ferromagnetic region of the ( @xmath153 ) plane is found to be @xcite somewhat larger than the best variational estimates,@xcite but the result is again remarkably good considering the subtlety of the energy balance in this problem and the simplicity of the method .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the hubbard i approach ,  @xcite which corresponds to setting @xmath154 .",
    "roth  @xcite pointed out that the constant shift @xmath94 in @xmath143 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) ] for the minority spin band is essential to stabilize the state of complete spin allignment for large @xmath29 near half - filling .",
    "recently hewson and wasserman  @xcite showed how an approach equivalent to the roth one leads to the results of slave - boson mean field theory in the anderson impurity model ; here again the shift in the impurity arising from @xmath94 is essential to place the resonant state correctly near the fermi level .",
    "these successes of the present approach encourage us to consider another subtle problem , superconductivity , in the next section .",
    "we shall see that an anomalous correlation function which characterizes the superconducting state is generated automatically , just like the correlation functions in @xmath143 .",
    "to discuss superconductivity we need to mix electron and hole operators and evaluate anomalous correlation functions in which particle number is not conserved . in this context",
    "we note that the procedure described in sec .",

    "the upper left 2x2 matrices are just @xmath73 and @xmath74 , given by eqs . ( [ eq : e2 ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) , and the lower right 2x2 matrices are easily shown to be @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the elements of the off - diagonal blocks involve anomalous correlation functions and are as follows : @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166 these expressions simplify considerably when we introduce the symmetry associated with either singlet or triplet pairing .",
    "the anomalous correlation functions are matrix elements between states which differ by the addition of one pair and the spin function associated with a pair is symmetric or antisymmetric for triplet or singlet pairing respectively .",
    "it follows that if all spin labels in the correlation function are reversed , i.e. @xmath167 , the sign changes in the singlet case but not in the triplet case .",
    "we first consider triplet pairing .",
    "owing to the spin symmetry the second terms in @xmath168 and @xmath169 vanish and @xmath170 .",
    "similarly all the elements of the off - diagonal blocks in @xmath157 vanish .",
    "furthermore , denoting the correlation function in the first term of @xmath168 by @xmath171 , we have @xmath172 using this symmetry we write : @xmath173 thus @xmath174 where @xmath175 similarly @xmath176 it will be seen shortly that @xmath177 is essentially the gap function and the nodes at @xmath178 indicate @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "this is as expected for triplet pairing .",
    "it is very interesting that the gap is determined not by a simple pair wave function @xmath179 , but by the more subtle correlation function @xmath171 .",
    "this quantity can not be evaluated directly from our green s functions . the simplest way to evaluate it , and",
    "hence obtain a gap equation , is by a factorization procedure described in sec .",
    "[ section : gap ] for the case of singlet @xmath22-wave pairing .",

    "the reason for this will be pointed out in sec .",
    "[ section : gap ] .",
    "we therefore find that @xmath1-wave superconductivity does not occur in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "we now turn to singlet pairing and discuss particularly the case of @xmath22-wave symmetry .",
    "we defer a discussion of @xmath9-wave symmetry to another occasion , partly because we believe it is less likely and partly because the possibility of on - site pairing @xmath180 means that all elements @xmath64 in the off - diagonal blocks are non - zero .",
    "the @xmath22-wave case is simpler because the @xmath22-symmetry of the pair wave function ensures that @xmath181 and that the summations of the pair wave function @xmath182 and of @xmath183 over sites @xmath184 , which are nearest neighbours of site @xmath86 , give zero .",
    "the consistency of these assertions can be checked by expressing these correlation functions in terms of the resultant green s function .",
    "thus @xmath170 and , as in the @xmath1-wave case , all elements of the off - diagonal blocks in @xmath157 vanish . in a similar way the second terms in @xmath168 and @xmath169 vanish and",

    "correlation helps by flattening the bands , accentuating the singularity , but must not be allowed to reduce site double occupation too markedly .",
    "nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic correlations are particularly important both in flattening the bands and in promoting double occupation .",
    "the correlations important for superconductivity in the present model are local ones and the mechanism is different from spin - fluctuation - exchange models .    in future work",
    "we propose to explore the possibility of @xmath9-wave pairing , particularly its degree of anisotropy if it is found to occur .",
    "work is in progress on extending the roth method consistently to two - particle green s functions , particularly with the aim of calculating the dynamical susceptibility @xmath364 and investigating the spin dynamics of the system .",
