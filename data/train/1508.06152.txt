    "the anais ( annual modulation with nai(tl ) scintillators ) experiment  @xcite is intended to confirm the dama / libra signal  @xcite using the same target and technique at the canfranc underground laboratory .",
    "the anais-25 set - up consisted of two nai(tl ) detectors of 12.5 kg each manufactured by alpha spectra ( named d0 and d1 in this work ) .",
    "it has been taking data since december 2012 in order to measure the internal contamination of the nai(tl ) crystals and assess the performance of the detectors .",
    "a new alpha spectra detector ( named d2 in this work ) with lower internal background  @xcite was received in march 2015 , which added to anais-25 modules formed the anais-37 set - up .",
    "every detector has been coupled to two hamamatsu r12669sel2 pmts , the anais selected model  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will report on the pmt single electron response ( ser ) data extracted from both set - ups on underground site and along normal operation which have been compared with the ser characterization of the pmts previously performed at zaragoza ( section 2 ) and on the estimates of the total light collection for all the available detectors ( sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "first , the pmts ser was measured at the zaragoza test bench using uv led illumination of very low intensity , and triggering in the excitation led signal .",
    "this characterization was done for each pmt unit before mounting anais detectors , and allowed to validate the ser determination onsite along normal operation of anais detectors at the lsc .",
    "the latter was performed applying a peak identification algorithm to the data taken at the lsc , building the ser by selecting peaks at the end of the pulse of each pmt in order to avoid trigger bias in pulses having a low number of peaks to prevent the pile - up of several photoelectrons ( phe ) .",
    "an example of a pulse fulfilling these conditions can be seen in figure [ fig : lp ] and the mean pulse of a selection of this kind of events is shown in figure [ fig : lpmean ] . the phe area ( proportional to charge ) is integrated in a fixed time window around the peak maximum in order to obtain the single electron response charge distribution .",
    "the ser charge distribution extracted for the same pmt by these two methods is compared in figure [ fig : ser_lp_led ] showing full agreement between both .",

    "the light collected by each of the pmts coupled to the anais-25 modules was calculated by dividing the mean value of the charge distribution associated to a known energy deposition in the nai crystal and the mean value of the ser charge distribution derived as aforementioned .",
    "the 22.6 kev line from a @xmath0 calibration source was used for this study .",
    "the result of the ser charge spectrum and the @xmath0 line gaussian fits can be seen in table  [ tab : a25_fits ] ( pmt ij corresponds to pmt j of detector di ) .",
    "these results and the global light collection of the two anais-25 detectors are summarized in table [ tab : a25ly ] .",
    "the @xmath0 line resolution is also calculated and is shown in table [ tab : a25cdres ] .",
    "these results confirm the prototypes outstanding light collection and its impact in resolution .",
    "the very good optical performance of the alpha spectra modules evidenced by these figures is very promising in order to reduce the energy threshold below 2 kevee  @xcite .",

    "the pmts single electron response was characterized along detectors normal operation and compared with the previous pmts measurements showing a full compatibility among them . using this extraction ,",
    "an excellent light collection for the three anais detectors , of the order of @xmath2515 phe / kev , has been measured .",
    "thanks to this , an energy threshold for the anais experiment at 1 kevee is at reach , depending now on improving the filtering protocols for pmt origin coincident events , which would significantly improve the sensitivity of the anais project in the search for the annual modulation effect in the wimps signal  @xcite .",
