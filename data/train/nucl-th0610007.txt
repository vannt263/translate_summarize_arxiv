    "nuclear matter present in compact and hot astrophysical objects generated in a gravitational collapse suffers from high thermal excursions.in the accessible range of temperature and densities , nuclear matter presents phase transitions characterized by density fluctuations . because of the presence of the long range coulomb interaction , those charge fluctuations give rise to so called `` frustration effects ''  @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the system organises in inhomogeneous phases , named `` pasta phases '' due to their unusual topologies  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of these structures with density is expected to be connected to the properties of the inner neutron - star crust.the survival of pasta - phases at finite temperature has been inferred from recent molecular - dynamics simulations  @xcite . as these complex structures are related to coherent neutrino scattering  @xcite , their evolution with density and temperature or , more generally , the underlying equation of state , becomes a key quest for exploring several interconnected astrophysical phenomena , like the dynamics of supernova explosion and the thermodynamics of proto - neutron - stars cooling .",
    "a tempting connection can be searched with the physics of atomic nuclei , which are experimentally accessible .",
    "comparable conditions of temperature and density can be probed in rather violent processes like nuclear multifragmentation . however , compact - star matter differs from normal nuclear matter due to the presence of electrons .",
    "they constitute an incompressible degenerated gas , which establishes a condition of global charge neutrality at large scale .",
    "to understand the phenomenology of phase transitions in compact stars , we consider an ising model .",
    "indeed widely used mean - field approximations  @xcite are known to fail to describe critical phenomena in 3d .",
    "the ising model is specifically suited for the analysis of charge fluctuations by exact calculations , since phase transitions are universal phenomena .",
    "moreover , it was largely employed in the study of ferromagnetic systems subjected to frustration  @xcite as well as for nuclear matter  @xcite where , in the form of the lattice - gas model , magnetic spins are replaced by site occupations .",
    "we construct a cubic periodic lattice composed of @xmath0 sites , each characterised by a position @xmath1 and an occupation number @xmath2 or @xmath3 , to indicate the presence or the absence of positive charge , respectively .",
    "this distribution of positive charge simulates the distribution of nuclear - matter charge ( neutron and protons without distinction are considered as nucleons with an effective charge z / a ) .",
    "the strongly incompressible gas of electrons is represented by a uniform distribution of negative charge  @xcite imposing a strict condition of neutrality . in any site",
    "we find therefore an effective charge @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the charge per site of the background of negative charge .",
    "the schematic hamiltonian @xmath6 with @xmath7 is introduced to study the interplay of nuclear - like ( @xmath8 ) and coulomb - like forces ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath10 is a sum extended over closest neighbors , and @xmath11 is the distance between sites @xmath1 and @xmath12 . the short - range and long - range interactions are characterized by the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , where @xmath15 is the nuclear saturation density , and @xmath16 is the proton fraction .",
    "the ratio of the two coupling constants @xmath17 measures the strength of frustration . in the sequel ,",
    "@xmath16 is fixed to @xmath18 , a value expected for proto - neutron stars .",
    "@xmath9 can be rewritten in terms of occupation products times the geometric constants @xmath19 as @xmath20 translational invariance , which is ensured by imposing the distance @xmath21 to be the shortest between @xmath1 and @xmath12 in the periodic space , imposes @xmath22 .",
    "hence , @xmath19 can be calculated by adopting periodic boundary conditions in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 if @xmath25 , and @xmath26 otherwise ; @xmath27 is calculated with respect to any position @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath9 preserves all the characteristic symmetries of the ising model and the coulomb energy is therefore invariant for lattice - occupation reversal .",
    "we should also point out that , despite some tempting similarities , the correspondent of eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) in spin variable @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the magnetization @xmath31 is not identical to the hamiltonian of the frustrated ising ferromagnet  @xcite , defined by @xmath32 indeed , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related by@xmath35 this connection includes a term in @xmath36 , scaling with @xmath37 .",
    "such term deeply modifies the thermodynamics in a finite system , and imposes @xmath38 at the thermodynamic limit for @xmath33 .",
    "the strict constraint @xmath38 on the order parameter @xmath39 leads to a substantial modification of the thermodynamics of the system@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the frustrated ferromagnet  @xcite , where , as in nuclei , the coulomb interaction reduces the phase - coexistence region ( i.e. decreases the limiting temperature ) , can not be directly exported to our system @xmath34 .",
    "example of a metropolis calculation ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "density distribution for a fixed value of @xmath41 and a series of temperatures , each one associated to one spectrum .",
    "the ensemble of explored temperatures and densities defines the phase diagram .",

    "is specifically suited .",
    "it consists in associating a lagrange multiplier to each component of the hamiltonian that we want to treat as a separate observable .",
    "in particular , it makes possible to construct one single phase diagram for both neutral and charged matter by associating one lagrange multiplier , @xmath46 , to the nuclear energy ( related to @xmath8 ) and another , @xmath41 , to the coulomb energy @xmath47 ( related to @xmath9 ) .",
    "the multi - canonical partition sum reads : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of states . for any finite value of @xmath41",
    ", we treat the system as equilibrated at the temperature @xmath50 and described by an equivalent effective charge @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath52 , the coulomb energy @xmath47 does no more influence the partition sum and the system behaves as uncharged , reducing to the standard ising model .",
    "the generalised grand potential is defined as @xmath53 where the fugacity is linked to the chemical potential by @xmath54 . when @xmath55 the ensemble coincides with the conventional grand - canonical form .",
    "we sampled the density distribution from eq.([macro ] ) for a chemical potential value @xmath56 , by employing a standard metropolis technique  @xcite .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] where , for a fixed value of @xmath41 , several density distributions are calculated for different temperatures @xmath57 .",
    "all bimodal distributions present a peak for the gas phase ( low - density ) and one for the liquid ( high - density ) phase .",
    "their height is equal because of the choice of @xmath40 .",
    "all distributions are composed together to draw a phase diagram : the ridge of the overall distribution of density and temperature delimits with its gas branch and liquid branch the phase coexistence .",
    "the two branches join at the limiting temperature .",
    "for two cases , either @xmath58 ( corresponding to the standard ising model ) , or @xmath59 , and for a series of different lattice sizes @xmath60 , we collected a series of calculations of the phase diagram .",
    "the results are schematized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the phase - coexistence region in the system @xmath58 shrinks for progressively larger lattice sizes according to the characteristic finite - size scaling behaviour of the ising system .",
    "in particular , since the asymptotic value of the limiting temperature @xmath61 corresponds to a critical point , finite - size scaling requires that @xmath62 evolves as @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "this is comfirmed by the calculated values of the critical exponent @xmath64 and the critical point @xmath65 , which correspond to the ising values .",
    "* left panel*. calculations of phase diagrams for the systems @xmath58 ( ising - like ) and @xmath59 ( frustrated ) .",
    "calculations for a series of different lattice sizes @xmath60 are associated to different limiting temperatures for the system @xmath58 ; they overlap for the system @xmath59 . *",
    "right panel*. for the system @xmath58 the test of the finite - size scaling law @xmath63 gives ising values for the critical exponent @xmath64 and the critical temperature @xmath66 .",
    "no scaling is observed for the system @xmath59 : this is a first indication of the quench of criticality in presence of a coulomb field . ]    at variance with the ising behaviour , the phase diagram of the system @xmath59 does however not vary with the lattice size .",
    "this first sign of incompatibility of the frustrated system with the ising model , is also a first indication of quenching of the critical behaviour .",
    "@xmath64 rules in fact the divergence of the correlation length at the critical point , which evolves as @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "if a critical point existed , it would correspond to a very large value for @xmath64 , which would then be hardly compatible with a diverging correlation length .",
    "the major result we infer from comparing the two systems and the corresponding asymptotic limiting temperature , is that the coexistence region expands under the action of a coulomb field .     *",
    "( a ) * increase of the limiting point and expansion of the phase - coexistence region with increasing frustration ( i.e. for higher @xmath69 ratios ) .",
    "four points determine different thermodynamical situations : points ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) belong to the coexistence region , points ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are at the limiting temperature ; while points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) refer to the system @xmath70 ( ising - like ) , points ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) refer to the system @xmath71 ( frustrated ) .",
    "the calculation refers to @xmath72 ; * ( b ) * in correspondence with the points marked in panel ( a ) , the probability distribution is evaluated for the two hamiltonian components , @xmath73 , which corresponds to the nuclear - energy density @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , representing the coulomb - energy density @xmath76 in the case of the frustrated system .",
    "contour plots refer to @xmath72 ; logarithmic cluster plots refer to @xmath77 .",
    "points ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) manifest bimodal patterns .",
    "the critical scaling effect exhibited at point ( 2 ) quenches at point ( 4 ) . ]",
    "the connection between the increase of the limiting point and charge fluctuations can be searched in the evolution of the event distribution with temperature and coulomb - field strength .",
    "[ fig : fig3]a illustrates the evolution of the limiting temperature with the strength of the coulomb field and the phase coexistence is indicated for the uncharged system @xmath70 and the frustrated system @xmath71 , in correspondence with the phase diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "we analyzed the event distribution along the path 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 , determined by four different thermodynamic situations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b the distributions are shown , as a function of the two hamiltonian components , @xmath73 and @xmath75 .",
    "point ( 1 ) belongs to the region of phase coexistence sampled for the uncharged system @xmath70 and presents a bimodal pattern with respect to the abscissa , which corresponds to the nuclear - energy density @xmath74 , so that pure liquid or gas partitions are preferred to mixed events .",
    "point ( 2 ) corresponds to the limiting temperature of the uncharged system @xmath70 , where mixed partitions are favoured . to pass from point ( 2 ) to point ( 3 ) the temperature is left unchanged while @xmath41 is increased from @xmath3 till it equals @xmath46 .",
    "once introduced the coulomb field , @xmath75 represents the coulomb - energy density @xmath76 , which should be minimized in the frustrated system . in order to satisfy this constraint ,",
    "the positive - charge distribution searches uniform patterns , which are better compensated by the uniform background of negative charges . as a result",
    ", the system moves to the phase - coexistence region to search pure partitions , and bimodality appears . in the frustrated system , the temperature should be further increased with respect to the limiting temperature of the system @xmath70 , point ( 3 ) , in order to find the limiting temperature , as indicated at point ( 4 ) .",
    "[ fig : fig3]b presents the event distributions sampled for two different lattice sizes , in order to test scaling effects which could indicate the presence of critical points . at a critical point",
    "the correlation length @xmath78 diverges and determines the exponential decay of the correlation function @xmath79 according to the expression @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the space dimension and @xmath82 is a critical exponent .",
    "on the basis of the properties of the @xmath19 matrix , @xmath83 is related to the mean coulomb - energy density by @xmath84 it is therefore typical of a critical point to exhibit a divergence of the quantity @xmath85 for progressively larger lattice sizes .",
    "this indicates that , at point ( 2 ) , the limiting point is compatible with a critical point , as we already expected from the finite - size scaling law tested in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] for the critical exponent @xmath64 . on the contrary ,",
    "no scaling is observed at the point ( 4 ) .",
    "indeed , as indicated by eq.([eq : energydens ] ) , when the coulomb field is introduced in the system , the diverging quantity would be the coulomb - energy density @xmath76 .",
    "to avoid such a singularity , the correlation length keeps a finite value at the limiting temperature and the critical character of the limiting temperature is lost  @xcite .",
    "a more formal discussion on the suppression of criticality on the basis of finite - size - scaling analysis is presented in ref .",
    "by employing a specific model for studying the thermodynamical features of a frustrated system , we could define general properties of a neutral system in presence of charge fluctuations , in analogy to compact - star matter .",
    "the study of the phase diagram and the phase - transition phenomenology indicated that the introduction of a coulomb field has the effect of increasing the limiting temperature without preserving any critical character .",
    "this result is the opposite as found for many other physical systems subject to coulomb frustration in the absence of global charge neutrality , from hot atomic nuclei to frustrated ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy with the phase - transition phenomenology characteristic of atomic nuclei , indicates that a connection between compact - star matter and nuclei is not trivial .",
    "conversely a widening of the density range connected to the pasta phases was found  @xcite within the rmf model , when the coulomb field is included under the constraint of global charge neutrality over the wigner - seitz cells .",
    "such a finding is directly compatible with the thermodynamic phenomenology we are drawing .",
    "it was also discussed  @xcite that neutrino propagation can be highly concerned by the presence of pasta phases and characterizes the process of neutron - star formation and cooling . with respect to homogeneous phases , the inhomogeneous phases ( like pasta phases ) present in the coexistence region",
    "are characterized by a larger opalescence to neutrino propagation . in the presence of a critical point",
    "the opalescence would diverge as a direct consequence of the divergence of the correlation length , and neutrinos would be trapped . on the contrary , we conclude that the medium stays `` grey '' at any temperature .",
    "this result seems also connected to the observation of small opacity for the transport of neutrinos discussed in ref .",
