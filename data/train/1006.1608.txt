    "transfer matrix method allows to find thermodynamic properties for many low - dimensional models @xcite , @xcite and shows thermodynamic equivalence for many of them @xcite , @xcite .",
    "important feature of the method is the possibility to establish a relation between thermodynamic of @xmath2-dimensional classical models and ground state of @xmath3-dimensional quantum models @xcite under the assumption of strongly anisotropic interactions in a classical system .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the conditions which are imposed on a classical system within strong - anisotropy approximation .",
    "besides that , a new strong - interaction approximation which requires weaker conditions is introduced . for the new approximation",
    "the transfer matrix is written in the symmetric form @xmath4 , see , and the expansion in nested commutators similar to the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula is performed .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian can be found explicitly only if the nested commutator of an arbitrary order @xmath5\\ldots]$ ] can be written in a specific form , ( see [ eqn : z_commutatorexplicitly ] ) .",
    "the strong - interaction limit reduces to the strong - anisotropy limit if we assume @xmath6=0 $ ] .",
    "the strong - anisotropy limit also can be obtained by applying the exponential operator decomposition technique @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the operator decomposition technique and the strong - interaction limit is that in the latter case we must calculate nested commutators instead of assuming that @xmath7 . for the @xmath0 spin-@xmath8 classical ising model",
    "the strong - interaction limit leads to the appearance of three - spin interactions in the resulting quantum chain .",
    "for the six - vertex model the new approximation gives the @xmath9 chain with four - spin interactions .",
    "we will use the transfer matrix method for classical @xmath0 models @xcite with the total energy that can be represented as a sum over rows @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a variable defined on the row @xmath12 with @xmath13 possible values .",
    "the free energy of the classical @xmath0 model ( per row ) can be written in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the transfer matrix with elements @xmath16 and the maximal eigenvalue @xmath17 which is real , unique and positive according to the perron - frobenius theorem @xcite for the positive symmetric matrix @xmath15 .",
    "we can consider @xmath13 configurations as orthonormal basis @xmath18 of @xmath13-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "each configuration @xmath19 corresponds to a base - vector in the hilbert space .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath15 corresponds to some operator @xmath20 .",
    "let us introduce the hamiltonian of a quantum system , which is defined by the logarithm of the operator @xmath21 @xmath22 the ground state energy for the quantum system described by hamiltonian is equal to the free energy , @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the inverse temperature of quantum system and it must be distinguished from the inverse temperature of classical system @xmath25 .",
    "we will elaborate approximate method which allow to find hamiltonian for @xmath0 classical systems at low temperatures or with strong interaction in one spatial dimension .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in the next ( second )",
    "section the strong - anisotropy and the strong - interaction approximations in general for a @xmath0 classical system are presented . in the third and fourth sections",
    "the methods are applied for the @xmath0 ising model and the six - vertex model respectively .",
    "quantum hamiltonians are obtained there .",
    "finally , in section five we compare the approximations by calculating critical temperatures for classical models .",
    "important calculations which we use for the strong - interaction approximation are collected in appendix .",
    "in general , for an arbitrary @xmath0 classical system with the total energy it is impossible to find the transfer matrix logarithm and write down the hamiltonian explicitly . in this section",
    "we consider two approximate methods used to find the quantum system hamiltonian . both of them are based on division of energy @xmath26 into two parts , @xmath27 which depends on configuration @xmath19 of single row only and @xmath28 which depends on two configurations @xmath19 and @xmath29 of successive rows .",
    "there are many possible divisions , but we choose the division symmetric with respect to two neighboring rows @xmath30 here @xmath27 is the energy of a single row with configuration @xmath19 and @xmath31 is the energy of the interaction between two rows with configurations @xmath19 and @xmath29 .",
    "division allows us to write @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "accordingly we can rewrite @xmath15 as a matrix product , @xmath35 , and @xmath21 as an operator product , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the diagonal operator and @xmath38 is the off - diagonal operator .    for further progress we have to rewrite operator @xmath39 in a slightly different form .",
    "it is convenient to assume @xmath40 ( that can be always achieved by including nonzero value @xmath41 into @xmath42 or by shifting all energies by a constant value ) .",
    "that makes diagonal elements of @xmath43 equal to unity , @xmath44 . among all off - diagonal elements of @xmath39",
    "we distinguish the elements which are proportional to some parameter @xmath45 ( which we will demand later to be small ) and collect these elements in operator @xmath46 @xmath47 all another off - diagonal elements which are @xmath48 we collect in operator @xmath49 .",
    "summing up @xmath50 where diagonal part @xmath51 is rewritten in the form @xmath52 until now no approximation has been made .",
    "we only assume that the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath45 exist",
    ". for both approaches , i.e. , strong - anisotropy limit and strong - interaction limit it will be later required that @xmath45 is small and we will neglect the terms @xmath48 . for each specific model",
    "the individual operator @xmath46 should be constructed bearing this requirement in mind . + * .1 the strong - anisotropy limit * can be introduced by neglecting the terms @xmath48 and by a naive assumption - commutativity of @xmath54 and @xmath46 in the expression for @xmath21 : @xmath55=0}}{\\approx } { \\mbox{e}^{2t_x { \\vec{x}}+ t_y { \\vec{y}}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more precisely , the last approximation in can be obtained by series expansions of the exponents and neglecting the terms @xmath56 and @xmath48 , @xmath57 finally , the hamiltonian in the strong - anisotropy limit has the form @xmath58    for the strong - anisotropy approximation it is often assumed that @xmath7 and @xmath59 .",
    "this conditions impose some relations on the classical system parameters .",
    "assumption @xmath7 is good to explain why approximation is called _ strong - anisotropy _ limit . if we consider the simplest case for model with all in - row energies proportional to @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and all inter - row interaction energies for different configurations not smaller than @xmath62 , @xmath63 , then the condition @xmath7 reads @xmath64 by demanding @xmath65 to be small we suppose @xmath62 to be large and @xmath60 to be small .",
    "it should be noted that by demanding @xmath65 to be small we also assume that @xmath66 .",
    "conditions @xmath67 , @xmath59 is weakest from a set of assumptions @xmath68 , @xmath59 which allow to apply strong - anisotropy approach .",
    "+ * .2 the strong - interaction limit * , in contrast to the strong - anisotropy limit , demands only @xmath45 to be small and does not put any restrictions on @xmath53 .",
    "we can rewrite the expression for transfer matrix in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an unknown operator defined by the function @xmath71 . the function z can be expand as series in the nested commutators of operators @xmath54 and @xmath46 ( see appendix ) . if a general nested commutator @xmath72_n=[{\\vec{x}},[{\\vec{x}},{\\vec{y}}]_{n-1}]$ ] can be presented explicitly via some operators @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( see [ eqn : z_commutatorexplicitly ] )",
    ", all calculations can be performed to the very end and @xmath70 can be found explicitly .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian in the strong - interaction limit takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the strong - anisotropy limit follows from the strong - interaction limit as expected .",
    "if we assume @xmath7 and neglect the terms @xmath79 the last term in vanishes since @xmath80 .",
    "in this section both approximations will be used for the @xmath0 classical ising model in order to find the corresponding @xmath1 quantum system .",
    "the classical @xmath0 ising model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath81 where @xmath82 assumes two values @xmath83 . a configuration in each row @xmath12",
    "is defined by a set of variables @xmath84 and it takes @xmath85 possible values .",
    "we will denote the configurations on two successive rows by @xmath86 and @xmath87 and use the following notation @xmath88 the hilbert space can be spanned by the basis @xmath89 .",
    "we can establish a correspondence between the states @xmath90 , @xmath91 and the eigenvectors of the spin operator @xmath92 . here and further on",
    "@xmath93 denotes @xmath94 .",
    "the diagonal part of the transfer matrix @xmath54 has the form @xmath95 where we omitted the direct products of the identity operators .",
    "the off - diagonal operator @xmath39 takes the form @xmath96 in contrast to the case of diagonal operator @xmath51 , eq .",
    ", we can not bring the direct products under the exponent . to construct the operator @xmath46 , we classify all matrix elements @xmath97 into three groups depending upon a number of different variables in @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the first group",
    "we collect all elements for which the rows @xmath98 are the same , i.e. the diagonal elements of @xmath39 .",
    "diagonal elements are equal to @xmath99 , as it was discussed above , we can obtain @xmath100 after shifting the energies by an appropriate quantity .",
    "all the matrix elements where the variables only on one cite differ , i.e. , @xmath101 will form the second group . in this case the interaction energy increases by @xmath102 and the matrix element of @xmath39 after energy shifting is equal to @xmath103 .",
    "the third group consists of all other matrix elements for the states @xmath86 , @xmath87 which are different on two or more sites .",
    "these elements are equal to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the number of sites with different variables @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "now , it can be seen how the small parameter @xmath45 should be set .",
    "if @xmath108 is small , we can construct an operator @xmath46 which has all matrix elements equal to zero except the elements between the states which differ by one variable @xmath109 ( second group ) .",
    "all other matrix elements ( third group ) which are of order @xmath48 may be included into a non - important operator @xmath110 .",
    "formally it can be done by rewriting the sum as follows : @xmath111 ( we notice that in order to calculate higher approximations with respect to @xmath45 operator @xmath110 should be presented as series with respect to @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",

    "in this section we will find the quantum hamiltonian in two approximations for the six - vertex model @xcite .",
    "the model consists of arrows on a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "arrows are associated to each link between the nearest lattice sites .",
    "the total energy is the sum over the lattice vertex energies .",
    "each vertex energy depends on configurations of four neighboring arrows .",
    "moreover , only six of such configurations are allowed . in fig.1",
    "the vertex configurations and the appropriate energies are shown .",
    "not all possible arrow configurations are allowed : for each vertex the arrow configuration must be one of a set depicted in fig.1 by bold solid arrows . in this paper",
    "we will consider a lattice `` rotated '' by @xmath129 with periodic boundary conditions imposed .",
    "the total energy has the form @xmath130 where the sum runs over all vertices .",
