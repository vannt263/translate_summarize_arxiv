    "diffusion in the presence of a point sink has always been a problem of great interest as it allows for the evaluation of important quantities like the survival probability and the first - passage time distribution .",

    "brownian motion in the presence of a point sink is a very well - studied , classic problem @xcite and has often been used to model chemical reactions in solution which are triggered by a first - passage event , in particular , the problem of electronic relaxation in solution @xcite .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equation for this problem is given by @xmath0p(x , t),\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the potential , @xmath2 is the sink strength ( with dimensions @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the position of the sink , @xmath5 is the diffusion constant , @xmath6 is the friction constant , and @xmath7 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the above reaction - diffusion equation is in the overdamped limit including the effect of a sink .",
    "one should note that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : brownian_smoluchowski ] ) , @xmath8 , is not a normalized quantity as the particle number is not conserved due to absorption .",
    "the probability of absorption of the particle on arrival at the sink is determined by @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath9 , the diffusing particle is completely annihilated when it reaches @xmath4 and its solution is widely given using the method of images @xcite which suggests that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the propagator in the absence of a sink .",
    "this solution results in ( i ) the density to be exactly equal to zero at @xmath4 and ( ii ) provides the correct @xmath8 for @xmath12 , i.e. for all final positions on the same side of the sink as the initial position . for @xmath13 , the method of images does not hold and the correct solution in this regime , @xmath14 in the case of brownian motion , is obtained from physical reasoning .    for a sink of finite strength , @xmath2 , the solution from the method of images can no longer be applied .",
    "this problem was studied in detail by @xcite and it was found that the laplace transform of the green s function corresponding to the motion in the presence of a finite sink can be given in terms of the laplace transform of the green s function in the absence of a sink as @xmath15 the derivation for the above expression , as given in @xcite , is provided in appendix [ app : greens_func ] .",
    "the importance of this result stems from ( i ) it is an exact result in the laplace doamain , ( ii ) provides a generalized solution for diffusive motion in the presence of a delta function sink of arbitrary strength ( @xmath2 ) and position ( @xmath4 ) , and ( iii ) in the time domain , it gives the correct solution for @xmath16 for all values of @xmath17 , unlike the method of images .",
    "though this result was derived in the context of brownian motion , it can be applied to any diffusive motion that is markovian .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study lvy flights in the presence of a delta function sink .",
    "lvy flights is a class of anomalous diffusion where the diffusing particle takes short steps at each interval of time interspersed by occasional , very long _ flights_. these step lengths are taken from a lvy distribution . a symmetric lvy distribution @xcite is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lvy index .",
    "when @xmath20 , the distribution reduces to a gaussian which is the step length distribution for brownian motion .",
    "lvy distributions are characterized by their fat tails and the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath21 , resulting in a diverging second moment as opposed to a finite variance for a gaussian .",
    "lvy motion can be described by a generalization of the fokker - planck equation , referred to as the fractional fokker - planck equation @xcite which is @xmath22 the fractional derivative operator accounts for long flights in the particle trajectory .",
    "the effect of a point sink on lvy flights can be captured using a modified fractional fokker - planck equation as it was done for brownian motion and is given by @xmath23 due to the non - local jumps @xcite , a lvy particle can leap over the sink without actually visiting it .",
    "this is fundamentally different from a brownian particle which , due to its finite variance , necessarily visits the sink before crossing it .",
    "the point sink can therefore play two distinct roles on lvy motion :    case 1 : _ the sink serves as a perfectly absorptive wall _ and the particle does not cross @xmath4 .",
    "this is the problem of lvy flights on a semi - infinite line @xcite for which the long - time behaviour of the first - passage time distribution ( fptd ) is given by the sparre andersen theorem @xcite . according to the theorem , the asymptotic behaviour of fptd for any markov process where the step sizes are chosen from an arbitrary continuous",
    ", symmetric distribution behaves as @xmath24 which is similar to that for brownian motion .",
    "this theorem goes to suggest that fptd shows a universal long - time behaviour , completely independent of the lvy index ; its coefficient however , depends on @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "case 2 : _ the point sink absorbs the particle only when it arrives exactly at @xmath4 , allowing for leaps over the sink .",
    "_ as a result of the non - local jumps , passage across the sink does not imply arrival at the sink .",
    "in such a situation , one has to be concerned about the _ first - arrival time distribution _ ( fatd ) and not fptd .",
    "( it must be noted that fptd and fatd are identical for brownian motion ) the green s function for this problem is zero only at the sink and non - zero on its either sides even if the sink strength is infinite . a naive approach to finding the propagator for",
    "this problem would be to use the method of images .",
    "however , as discussed for brownian motion , this would give incorrect results for @xmath13 .",
    "the long - time behaviour of fatd for free lvy flight with a perfectly absorbing sink was found to be @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 further , it was found that the solution obtained from the method of images has a @xmath28 which is neither consistent with the above fatd nor with the sparre - anderson theorem .    in this paper ,",
    "the effect of a point sink on lvy flights as described in _ case 2 _ , is studied .",
    "this work goes beyond the finding in eq .",
    "( [ eq : levy_free_sink ] ) to include delta function sinks of finite strength ( @xmath2 ) at arbitrary locations ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "for this purpose , the prescription for the green s function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : greens_function_laplace ] ) is used . in the presence of a sink of finite strength ,",
    "the probability of absorption of the particle upon its first - arrival at the sink is lesser than unity ( see eq . [ eq : prob_abs ] ) and therefore , the quantity of interest will be the _ absorption time distribution _ and not fatd . for a sink of infinite strength , the absorption time distribution will reduce to fatd .",
    "several situations of physical interest can be studied using fractional diffusion in the presence of a finite sink .",
    "one such example is polymer surface diffusion .",
    "single - molecule fluorescence experiments suggest that if the surface contains only a limited number of adsorption sites , the polymers are not completely adsorbed at all times and the diffusion does not occur by polymer - crawling on the surface .",
    "the diffusion proceeds via a repeated adsorption - desorption mechanism mediated by diffusion into the bulk @xcite . due to this mechanism ,",
    "the trajectories of polymer segments on the surface show long jumps which are modeled using a truncated lvy flight with @xmath30 for the case studied in @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the adsorption sites are not identical ; some sites allow for desorption more readily than the others @xcite and these ` weakly ' adsorbing sites may be modeled using finite sinks .",
    "though the problem dealt with in this paper has only one finite point sink , it can be easily extended to an array of finite sinks ( like it is in the polymer surface diffusion problem ) .    protein diffusion on dna offers yet another interesting application .",
    "dna being a polymer , has its loop - size distribution given by a fat - tailed lvy distribution @xcite .",
    "an enzyme such as the dna polymerase diffuses on the dna in search of a particular to codon and binds to this site triggering the unzipping process . due to the presence of loops , the protein could diffuse across to the neck of the loop , referred to as the intersegmental transfer , and the diffusion when viewed from the topology of the dna , appears to be a lvy flight @xcite .",
    "the binding to the target site can be modeled by the delta function sink and the error induced in biological processes due to improper binding can be given by a finite @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that encounters in biology such as foraging , predator - prey dynamics and pollination have significant advantages by adopting lvy strategies for their search @xcite , and they can be studied using a fractional reaction - diffusion equation @xcite . with a finite sink as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : levy_smoluchowski_sink ] ) , one can include ` non - reactive ' encounters , i.e. those encounters which do not halt the diffusive search .",
    "several other examples such as dynamics of infection - transfer , motion of the eye microsaccade which is essential for visual fixation @xcite , foraging activity by the human brain and memory retrieval @xcite , and activity in stock markets resulting after the stocks hit a threshold value for the first time @xcite are potential applications of the problem discussed in this paper .    in section [ sec : sink_diff_pot ] of this paper , the role of an absorbing sink on the propagator and absorption time distribution is studied for ( i ) free particle , ( ii ) particle subjected to linear potential , and ( iii ) harmonic potential .",
