    "one of the well - studied but still challenging equations in nonlinear dynamics is the duffing - van der pol oscillator equation @xcite . its autonomous version ( force - free ) is @xmath0 where over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time and @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary parameters . equation ( [ eq1 ] ) arises in a model describing the propagation of voltage pulses along a neuronal axon and has received a lot of attention recently by many authors .",
    "a vast amount of literature exists on this equation , for details see for example @xcite and references therein . in most of the works non - integrability properties",
    "have been considered primarily since the forced version of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) exhibits a rich variety of bifurcations and chaotic phenomena .",
    "when @xmath3 , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes the ( force - free ) duffing oscillator whose integrability and non - integrability properties are well - known @xcite , while when the cubic term is absent it is the standard van der pol equation .",
    "as far as the integrability properties of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) are concerned not much progress has been made mainly due to the fact that it does not pass the painlev test as it admits a movable algebraic branch point and a local laurent expansion in the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants .",
    "however , it is known that the system ( [ eq1 ] ) admits nontrivial symmetries and a first integral for a specific parametric choice @xcite @xmath8 the associated first integral reads @xmath9 rewriting ( [ eq4 ] ) we get @xmath10 which is nothing but a special case of the abel s equation of the first kind @xcite.however , it has not been explicitly integrated directly due to the explicit time dependent part in the first integral and so the complete integrability of ( [ eq1 ] ) for the choice ( [ eq3 ] ) remains unclear till date . in this work ,",
    "we integrate the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) explicitly for the parametric choice ( [ eq3 ] ) and provide a general solution for the above specific parametric choice of the duffing - van der pol nonlinear oscillator , thereby establishing its complete integrability .",
    "further , we show that our procedure has a wider applicability , including linearization , through additional examples .",
    "rewriting ( [ eq1 ] ) with the specific parametric choice ( [ eq3 ] ) we get @xmath11 now introducing a transformation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are new dependent and independent variables respectively , equation ( [ eq5 ] ) can be transformed to @xmath15 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "equation ( [ eq7a ] ) can be integrated trivially to yield @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the integration constant .",
    "equivalently , the transformation ( [ eq6 ] ) reduces ( [ eq4 ] ) to this form . solving ( [ eq7 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath18 , \\label { eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19{\\frac { 6i}{\\beta ^2}}$ ] and @xmath20 is the second integration constant ( see figure 1 for a plot of the solution @xmath21 ) . replacing the second term inside the square bracket in ( [ eq8 ] ) in terms of logarithmic function we get @xmath22=\\frac { 3i}{a}(z - z_0 ) , \\label { eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 .",
    "this can be further simplified to @xmath24^{i\\sqrt{3 } } \\left[\\frac{\\bar{w}+1}{(\\bar{w}^2-\\bar{w}+1)}\\right]=\\frac{1}{a } e^{\\frac { 6i}{a}(z - z_0)}.\\label { eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] rewriting @xmath25 and @xmath14 in terms of old variables one can get the explicit solution for the equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "one may note that a simple solution for equation ( [ eq5 ] ) can also be built from the first integral ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "restricting @xmath26 in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) yields @xmath27 rewriting ( [ eq10a ] ) in terms of the old coordinates we get a particular solution for ( [ eq5 ] ) in the form @xmath28",
    "one can construct the transformation ( [ eq6 ] ) systematically from the first integral ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "for example , let us split the functional form of the first integral @xmath17 into two terms such that one involves all the variables @xmath29 while the other excludes @xmath30 , that is , @xmath31 now let us split the function @xmath32 further in terms of two functions such that @xmath32 itself is a function of the product of the two functions , say , a perfect differentiable function @xmath33 and another function @xmath34 , that is , @xmath35 we note that while rewriting equation ( [ eq11 ] ) in the form ( [ eq12 ] ) , we demand the function @xmath36 in ( [ eq11 ] ) automatically to be a function of @xmath37 . now identifying the function @xmath38 as the new dependent variable and the integral of @xmath39 over time as the new independent variable , that is , @xmath40 one indeed obtains an explicit transformation to remove the time dependent part in the first integral ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we note here that the integration on the right hand side of ( [ eq13 ] ) leading to @xmath14 can be performed provided the function @xmath39 is an exact derivative of @xmath41 , that is , @xmath42 , so that @xmath14 turns out to be a function @xmath41 and @xmath43 alone . in terms of the new variables , equation ( [ eq12 ] ) can be modified to the form @xmath44 in other words @xmath45 now rewriting equation ( [ eq13a ] ) one obtains a separable equation @xmath46 which can be integrated by quadrature .",
    "for the special case of the duffing - van der pol oscillator equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , by following the procedure given above , we can deduce the transformation ( [ eq6 ] ) systematically from the first integral ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we rewrite equation ( [ eq4a ] ) as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "equation ( [ eq14 ] ) can be further split into @xmath49 comparing equation ( [ eq14a ] ) with ( [ eq12 ] ) we get @xmath50 which in turn provides the transformation coordinates , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , through the relation ( [ eq13 ] ) of the form @xmath51",
    "we observe that the above procedure can be extended to solve a class of equations . in the following",
    "we briefly describe the applicability of this method to duffing oscillator and the equation describing the motion of a gaseous general - relativistic fluid sphere .",
    "a detailed connection between the integrating factors , integrals of motion and the transformation coordinates will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us consider the duffing oscillator @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are arbitrary parameters . in the absence of the external forcing @xmath55 ,",
    "equation ( [ eq15 ] ) has been shown to be integrable for a specific parametric choice @xcite , namely , @xmath56 .",
    "the first integral for this parametric choice has been constructed in the form @xmath57.\\label { eq16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq16 ] ) is a complicated nonlinear first order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) with explicit time dependent coefficients and so can not be integrated directly . a usual way to overcome",
    "this problem is to transform equation ( [ eq16 ] ) to an autonomous equation and integrate it .",
    "using our procedure one can construct the required transformations systematically .",
    "for example , rewriting equation ( [ eq16 ] ) in the form ( [ eq11 ] ) we get @xmath58 now splitting the first term in equation ( [ eq17 ] ) further in the form of ( [ eq12 ] ) , @xmath59 ^ 2 + \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2 } } e^{\\frac { \\alpha}{3}t}\\right)^4 , \\label { eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and identifying the dependent and independent variables from ( [ eq18 ] ) using the relations ( [ eq13 ] ) , we obtain the transformation @xmath60 one can easily check that equation ( [ eq16 ] ) can be transformed into the autonomous form with the help of the transformation ( [ eq19 ] ) and the latter can be integrated in terms of jacobian elliptic function @xcite .",
    "we note that the transformation ( [ eq19 ] ) exactly coincides with the one known in the literature which has been constructed in an ad hoc way .",
    "recently , duarte etal @xcite have constructed the first integral for an equation describing the static gaseous general relativistic fluid sphere @xcite , @xmath61 through the so called prelle - singer procedure , in the form @xmath62 we note that unlike the earlier two examples , namely duffing and duffing- van der pol oscillators , we have no exponential function in the first integral . also the first integral",
    "is a rational function .",
    "however , in the following we show that one can integrate it and obtain a general solution for this problem . by following our procedure , equation ( [ eq21 ] ) can be recast in the form @xmath63 one may note that the first term in ( [ eq21a ] ) can be written in terms of a perfect differential form , that is , @xmath64)^2 $ ] so that @xmath65 and the function @xmath39 turns out to be a constant , @xmath66 , in the present example . as a consequence",
    "we obtain a transformation @xmath67 which can be utilized to rewrite equation ( [ eq21 ] ) in the autonomous form @xmath68 equation ( [ eq23 ] ) can be integrated under two different choices @xcite , namely , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the respective solutions are @xmath71 where @xmath20 is the second integration constant . rewriting equation ( [ eq23b ] ) we get @xmath72 utilizing ( [ eq22 ] ) in ( [ eq23d ] )",
    "one can write down the solution for the static gaseous general relativistic fluid sphere of the form @xmath73 to our knowledge this solution is new to this problem .",
    "interestingly , our method not only helps to integrate the first integral and gives the complete solution for a class of second order nonlinear odes but it also helps to deduce the transformations which can be used to linearize the given nonlinear odes in a very systematic way .",
    "for example , let us consider the modified emden equation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are arbitrary parameters . mahomed and leach @xcite have shown that equation ( [ eq24 ] ) is linearizable through point transformations for a particular parametric choice , namely , @xmath77 .",
    "the linearizing transformation and the first integral are known to be @xmath78 and",
    "@xmath79 substituting ( [ eq25 ] ) into ( [ eq24 ] ) one can transform the latter into the free particle equation , that is , @xmath80 the authors have derived the linearizing transformation through lie symmetry analysis @xcite . however , in the following we show that the linearizing transformation ( [ eq25 ] ) can also be derived from the first integral itself through our method .    rewriting the first integral ( [ eq26 ] ) in the form @xmath81 , \\label { eq28 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and identifying ( [ eq28 ] ) with ( [ eq12 ] ) we get",
    "@xmath82 one can see that , unlike the earlier examples discussed so far , in the present example @xmath39 depends both on @xmath43 and @xmath30 .",
    "however , as we noted earlier the new variable @xmath14 can be obtained once the function @xmath39 is a perfect derivative of @xmath41 , that is , @xmath83 so that ( [ eq13 ] ) gives @xmath84 which is nothing but the linearizing transformation .",
    "one may note that in this case while rewriting the first integral @xmath17 ( equation ( [ eq26 ] ) ) in the form ( [ eq11 ] ) , the function @xmath85 disappears , that is @xmath86 , and as a consequence we arrive at ( vide equation ( [ eq13a ] ) ) @xmath87 which in turn gives ( [ eq27 ] ) by differentiation or leads to the solution by an integration . on the other hand vanishing of the function @xmath85 in this analysis",
    "is precisely the condition for the system to be transformed into the free particle equation @xcite .",
    "one of the common problems in solving second order nonlinear odes is how to solve the time dependent first integral and obtain a general solution associated with the given equation .",
    "in fact most of the methods available to tackle the second order nonlinear odes provide first integrals only . in this work ,",
    "we have proposed a novel method to identify transformation coordinates which can be used to rewrite the first integral without explicit time dependence so that it can be integrated by quadrature .",
    "interestingly , we showed that the transformation coordinates can be constructed from the first integral itself . with this choice",
    ", the above procedure can be augmented with other existing methods to obtain a complete solution for a given problem .",
    "we have also shown the applicability of our method in constructing linearizing transformations as well in a simple and straightforward way .",
    "finally , we mention that the proposed method can also be used to study certain coupled nonlinear oscillators , the details of which will be presented separately @xcite .",
