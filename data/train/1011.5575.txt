    "the compact muon solenoid  ( cms )  [ 1 ] is one of two general - purpose particle physics detectors built at the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the detector has been designed to study various aspects of proton - proton ( @xmath6 ) collisions at @xmath714  tev and heavy - ion(pb - pb ) collisions at @xmath75.5  tev , that will be provided by the lhc at a design luminosity of @xmath8 and of @xmath9 , correspondingly . to enhance the physics reach of the experiment",
    "the cms subcomponents must provide high - precision measurements of the momentum and the energy of collision - products .",
    "the cms detector comprises the tracking system covering the pseudorapidyty range @xmath10 and the calorimetry system covering the pseudorapity range @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to that , cms includes several very forward calorimeters , whose design and physics potential will be described later in this article .",
    "it should be emphasized that the cms detector is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built .",
    "it comprises about @xmath12 millions of readout channels in total .",
    "the detector has been designed , constructed and currently operated by the collaboration consisting of more than @xmath13 scientists from @xmath14 countries .",
    "first collision data taking at cms took place in november 2009 . since then and by the end of may 2010",
    ", cms has collected around @xmath15  @xmath16 of collision data .",
    "it should be noted that the quality of collected data is rather good : more than @xmath17 of cms readout channels are operational and the cms data taking efficiency is above @xmath18 .",
    "several tens of @xmath19 of the @xmath6 collision data are expected to be collected by the end of 2010 .",
    "the maximum possible rapidity at the lhc in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath20  tev is @xmath21 and one of the great features of the cms experiment is that it includes several subdetectors covering the kinematic region at very small polar angles and so , large values of rapidity .",
    "a schematic view of cms forward detectors is shown in figure  1 . as can be seen",
    ", the cms forward instrumentation consists of the hadronic forward calorimeter  ( hf ) , the castor and zdc calorimeters .",
    "all of them are sampling calorimeters .",
    "that is , they are made of repeating layers of a dense absorber and tiles of scintillator .",
    "a separate experiment totem as well as proton detectors fp420 are additional forward detectors around the cms interaction point  ( ip5 ) .",
    "they further extend the forward reach available around ip5 .",
    "[ [ hf ] ] hf ~~    the cms hf detector  [ 2 ] includes two calorimeters hf+ and hf , which are located at a distance of @xmath22  m on the both sides from the ip5 covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath23 .",
    "the detector is designed to carry out the measurements of the forward energy flow and forward jets .",
    "the hf is a cerenkov sampling calorimeter which uses radiation hard quartz fibers as the active material and steel plates as the absorber .",
    "the signal in the hf is produced when charged shower particles pass through the quartz fibers with the energy above the cerenkov threshold ( @xmath24  kev for electrons ) .",
    "the generated cerenkov light is then collected by air - code light guides , which are connected to photo - multipliers tubes pmts .",
    "the detector fibers run parallel to the beamline and are bundled to form @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) towers .",
    "half of the fibers run over the full depth of the absorber , whereas the other half starts at a depth of @xmath27  cm from the front of the detector .",
    "these two sets of fibers are read out separately .",
    "such a structure allows to distinguish showers generated by electrons and photons , which deposit a large fraction of their energy in the first @xmath27  cm , from those generated by hadrons , which produce signals in both calorimeter segments .",
    "the detector is embedded into a cylindrical steel structure with the outer radius of @xmath28  cm and the inner radius of @xmath29  cm to accommodate the beam pipe .",
    "it is azimuthally subdivided into @xmath30 modular wedges , each of which consists of two azimuthal sectors of @xmath31 .",
    "the detector extends over @xmath15 interaction lengths and includes @xmath32 towers in total .",
    "the castor ( centauro and strange object reseacrh ) detector  [ 3 ] is a quartz - tungsten cerenkov sampling calorimeter , which is located at a distance of @xmath33  m from the ip5 and covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath34 .",
    "the tungsten metal has been chosen as the absorber medium in castor , since it provides the smallest possible shower size . in this detector ,",
    "the radiation hard quartz plates used as the active medium are tilted at @xmath35 to efficiently capture the cerenkov light produced by relativistic particles passing the detector . as in the case of the hf ,",
    "the produced cerenkov light is collected by air - code light guides that are connected to pmts , which produce signals proportional to the amount of light collected .",
    "the castor detector is a compact calorimeter with the physical size of about @xmath36 and having no segmentation in @xmath37 .",
    "it is embedded into a skeleton , which is made of stainless steel .",
    "the detector consists of @xmath38 longitudinal modules , each of which comprises @xmath39 azimuthal sectors that are mechanically organized in two half calorimeters .",
    "first @xmath40 longitudinal modules form the electromagnetic section , while the other @xmath41 modules form the hadronic section . in the electromagnetic section ,",
    "the thicknesses of the tungsten and quartz plates are @xmath42 and @xmath43  mm respectively , whereas in the hadronic section the corresponding thicknesses are @xmath44 and @xmath45  mm . with this design ,",
    "the diameter of the showers of electrons and positrons produced by hadrons is about one cm , which is an order of magnitude smaller than in other types of calorimeters .",
    "the detector has a total depth of @xmath46 interaction lengths and includes @xmath47 readout channels .",
    "the cms zdc  ( zero degree calorimeter ) detector  [ 4 ] consists of two calorimeters that are located inside the tan absorbers at the ends of the straight section of the lhc beampipe at a distance of 140  m on both sides from the ip5 .",
    "these are cerenkov sampling calorimeters with quarz fibers as the active material and tungsten plates as the absorber material .",
    "the zdc detector is designed to measure neutrons and very forward photons providing detection coverage in the pseudorapidity region @xmath48 .",
    "each zdc is made up of separate electromagnetic and hadronic sections .",
    "the electromagnetic section consists of @xmath49 layers of @xmath40  mm thick tungsten plates and @xmath49 layers of @xmath50  mm thick quartz fibers .",

    "the electromagnetic section is segmented into @xmath53 horizontal individual readout towers , whereas the hadronic section is longitudinally segmented into @xmath54 readout segments .",
    "the tungsten plates are oriented vertically in the electromagnetic section whereas they are tilted by @xmath35 in the hadronic section .",
    "the detector is read out via aircore light guides and pmts .",
    "it has a total depth of @xmath55 interaction length .",
    "totem  [ 5 ] is an independent experiment at the cms interaction point whose main objectives are the precise measurement of the total @xmath6 cross - section and a study of elastic and diffractive scattering at the lhc . to achieve optimum forward coverage for charged particles ,",
    "totem comprises two tracking telescopes , t1 and t2 , that are installed on both sides from the ip5 in the pseudorapidity region @xmath56 , and roman pot stations that are located at distances of @xmath57  m and @xmath58  m from the ip5 .",
    "the t1 telescope is located in front of hf and consists of @xmath53 planes of cathode strip chambers , while the t2 telescope is located in front of castor and comprises @xmath15 planes of gas electron multipliers .",
    "for efficient reconstruction of very forward protons , silicon strip detectors are housed in the roman pot stations .",
    "fp420  [ 6 ] is a proposed detector system , which is supposed to provide proton detection at a distance of @xmath59  m from the ip5 .",
    "the fp420 detector comprises a silicon tracking system that can be moved transversely and measure the spatial position of protons , which have been bent out by the lhc magnets due to the loss of a small fraction of their initial momentum .",
    "the potential physics topics that can be studied with this detector system include higgs central exclusive production as well as a rich qcd and electroweak program .",
    "extending the physics reach of cms , the program for forward physics includes studies of low-@xmath0 qcd and diffractive scattering , multi - parton interactions and underlying event structure , @xmath1mediated processes and luminosity determination .",
    "it is also supposed to contribute to the discovery physics via searches of mssm higgs in central exclusive production .",
    "a study of qcd processes at a very low parton momentum fraction @xmath60 is a key to understand the structure of the proton , whose gluon density is poorly known at very low values of @xmath0 .",
    "low-@xmath0 qcd dynamics can be studied in @xmath6 collisions if the parton momentum fraction of one of the colliding protons @xmath61 is significantly larger than the parton momentum fraction of the other colliding proton @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the result of such a collision is a creation of either jets , prompt-@xmath1 or drell - yan electron pairs at very low polar angles in the very forward region of the detector .",
    "low-@xmath0 qcd studies at cms will be a continuation of studies of deep inelastic scattering in electron - proton collisions at hera , where low-@xmath0 qcd dynamics has been explored down to values of @xmath64 .",
    "measurements at hera have shown that the gluon density in the proton rises rapidly with decreasing values of @xmath0 . as long as the densities are not too high this rise",
    "can either be described by the dglap model  [ 7 ] that assumes strong ordering in the transverse momentum @xmath65 or by the bfkl model  [ 8 ] that assumes strong ordering in @xmath0 and random walk in @xmath65 . eventually at low enough @xmath0 ,",
    "the gluon - gluon fusion effects become important saturating the growth of the parton densities .    at the lhc the minimum accessible @xmath0 in @xmath6 collisions decreases by a factor of about @xmath15 for each @xmath40 units of rapidity .",
    "this implies that a process with a hard scale of @xmath66  gev and within the castor / t2 detector acceptance can probe quark densities down @xmath67 .",
    "such processes include the production of forward jets and drell - yan electron pairs .",
    "a low-@xmath0 parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the proton can be constrained by measuring single inclusive jet cross - section in hf .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the @xmath68 distribution for parton - parton scattering in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath20  tev requiring at least one jet with the transverse energy above @xmath69  gev in the hf acceptance . as can be seen , by measuring forward jets in hf one can probe @xmath0 values as low as @xmath64 .    a detailed analysis of fully simulated and reconstructed qcd jet events generated with pythia in the range @xmath70  gev / c@xmath71",
    "gev / c in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath20  tev for an integrated luminosity of @xmath72  @xmath19 shows that the momentum resolution for forward jets in hf is about @xmath73 at @xmath70  gev / c and is gradually decreasing to @xmath74 at @xmath75  gev / c  [ 9 ] . a possibility to gain information on the full qcd evolution to study high order qcd reactions can be provided by measuring forward jets in the castor calorimeter , that will allow to probe the parton densities down @xmath76 . apart from that , it has been found that a bfkl like simulation predicts more hard jets in the castor acceptance than the dglap model .",
    "therefore , measurements of forward jets in castor can be used as a good tool to distinguish between dglap and non - dglap type of qcd evolution .",
    "further studies of low-@xmath0 qcd can be made with mueller - navalet dijet events , which are characterized by two jets with similar @xmath77 but large rapidity separation . by measuring mueller - navalet dijets in castor and hf one",
    "can probe bfkl - like dynamics and small-@xmath0 evolution .",
    "low-@xmath0 proton pdfs can also be constructed by measuring electron pairs produced via the drell - yan process @xmath78 within the acceptance of castor and totem - t2 station , whose usage is essential for detecting these events .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath79 of the @xmath80 system against the parton momentum fraction @xmath62 of one of the quarks , where @xmath62 is chosen such that @xmath81 . in this figure",
    ", the solid line indicates the kinematic limit , whereas the region between the dotted lines is the acceptance window for both electrons to be detectable in castor / t2 .",
    "the green points show the events with at least one electron lying in castor / t2 acceptance and the blue points indicate the events with both electrons present within the castor / t2 acceptance , while the black points correspond to any of the drell - yan events generated with pythia .",
    "as can be seen , by measuring two electrons in the castor / t2 acceptance one can access @xmath0 values down to @xmath76 for @xmath82  gev  [ 10 ] .",
    "futhermore , measurements of drell - yan events in the castor / t2 acceptance can be used to study qcd saturation effects .",
    "it has been found that the drell - yan production cross section is suppressed roughly by a factor of @xmath40 when using a pdf with saturation effects compared to one without .      in @xmath6 collisions",
    "a diffractive process is a reaction @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 can either be protons or low - mass systems which may be a resonance or a continuum state . in all cases , the final states",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 acquire the energy approximately equal to that of the incoming protons and carry the quantum numbers of the proton as well as are separated by a large rapidity gap  ( lrg ) .",
    "diffraction in the presence of a hard scale can be described with perturbative qcd by the exchange of a colourless state of quarks or gluons , whereas soft diffraction at high energies is described in the regge theory  [ 11 ] as a colourless exchange mediated by the pomeron having the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "the cross section of hard diffractive processes can be factorized into generalized parton distributions and diffractive parton distributions functions  ( dpdf ) , which contain a valuable information about low-@xmath0 partons .",
    "however , the factorization becomes broken when scattering between spectator partons takes place .",
    "this effect is quantified by the so - called rapidity gap survival probability that can be probed by measuring the ratio of diffractive to inclusive processes with the same hard scale . at the tevatron",
    ", the ratio is found to be @xmath86 , whereas theoretical expectations at the lhc vary from a fraction of a percent to up to @xmath87  [ 12 ] .",
    "the two main types of diffractive processes occurring in @xmath6 collisions are the single diffractive dissociation  ( sd ) where one of the protons dissociates and the double diffractive dissociation  ( dd ) where both protons are scattered into a low - mass system .",
    "the single - diffractive productions of @xmath88 and dijets are in particular very interesting processes to study , since they are sensitive to the quark and gluon content of the pdfs , correspondingly .",
    "they both are hard diffractive processes that can provide information on the rapidity gap survival probability .",
    "a selection of such events can be performed using the multiplicity distributions of tracks in the central tracker and calorimeter towers in hf plus castor exploiting the fact that diffractive events on average have lower multiplicity in the central region and in the @xmath89gap side@xmath89 than non - difractive ones .",
    "feasibility studies to detect the sd productions of @xmath88  [ 13 ] and dijets  [ 14 ] have shown that the diffractive events peak in the regions of no activity in hf and castor .",
    "another interesting topic that is going to be studied at cms is the exclusive dilepton production @xmath90 , which can either occur via @xmath91 photoproduction @xmath92 or via the pure qed process @xmath93 that has been observed by the cdf experiment at the tevatron  [ 15 ] .",
    "the latter is an elastic process whose production cross section is precisely known . as a result , it can potentially serve as an ideal calibration channel and is going to be used for measuring the luminosity at the lhc . using this process",
    "an absolute luminosity calibration with the accuracy of @xmath94 is feasible with @xmath95  @xmath19 of data  [ 16 ] .",
    "the dominant background source for this mode is inelastic processes , where one of the proton in the process does not stay intact but dissociates .",
    "it can be significantly suppressed by applying a veto condition on activity in castor and zdc .",
    "exclusive dilepton production occurring via @xmath91 photoproduction is also a mode of interest , since the cross section of the @xmath91 photoproduction process is sensitive to the generaliszed pdf for gluons in the proton .",
    "finally , it should be noted that exclusive dimuon production is an ideal alignment channel for the proposed fp420 proton detectors .",
    "multi - parton interactions  ( mpi ) arise in the region of small-@xmath0 where parton densities are large so that the likelihood of more than one parton interaction per event is high . according to all qcd models , the larger the collision energy the greater the contribution from multiple parton interactions to the hard scattering process .",
    "however , the dependence of the mpi cross section on the collision energy is not well known and needs to be studied . a good way to study multiple parton interactions",
    "is provided by the energy flow in the forward region , which is directly sensitive to the amount of parton radiation and mpi .",
    "measurements of the forward energy flow will allow to discriminate between different mpi models , which vary quite a lot , and provide additional input to the determination of the parameters of the existing mpi models .",
    "furthermore , measurements of forward particle production in @xmath6 and pb - pb collisions at lhc energies should help to significantly improve the existing constraints on ultra - high energy cosmic ray models .",
    "the primary energy and composition of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays are currently determined from monte carlo simulations using regge - gribov - based approaches  [ 17 ] ( where the primary particle production is dominated by forward and soft qcd interactions ) with parameters constrained by the existing collider data at the @xmath96  ev , whereas the measured energies of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays extend up to @xmath97  ev and even beyond . at the lhc energy of @xmath98  ev",
    ", a more reliable determination of the cosmic ray energy and composition becomes possible .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that the forward energy flow has never previously been measured at a hadron collider .",
    "a search for forward jets in the pseudorapidity range @xmath23 has been made as soon as the cms detector has started to take collision data  [ 18 ] .",
    "one of the first candidates of a forward dijet event recorded by cms at @xmath3  tev is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the displayed event includes one forward jet and one backward jet both with a corrected @xmath77 above @xmath15  gev / c .",
    "early measurements of the energy flow in the forward region of the cms detector have been made with minimum bias events using the @xmath6 collision data sets collected at @xmath3  tev and @xmath4  tev in the fall of 2009 and at @xmath99  tev in march 2010  [ 19 ] . to select the events of interest the following conditions were imposed .",
    "first , the beam scintillator counters  ( bsc ) and the beam pick - up timing for the experiments  ( bptx ) , both are elements of the cms detector monitoring system , were used to trigger the detector readout .",
    "the bsc devices are located at a distance of @xmath100  m on both sides from the interaction point covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath101 and providing hit and coincidence signals with a time resolution of about @xmath102  ns .",
    "each bsc comprises @xmath39 scintillator tiles .",
    "the two bptx elements are located around the beam pipe at a distance of @xmath103  m from the interaction point providing precise information on the bunch structure and timing of the incoming beam with a time resolution better than @xmath104  ns . to select the minimum bias events with activity in the forward regions , the coincidence between a trigger signal in the bsc scintillators and bptx signals",
    "was required for both beams .",
    "next , to ensure that the selected event is a collision candidate , the events were required to have at least one primary vertex reconstructed from at least @xmath102 tracks with a @xmath105 distance to the interaction point below @xmath106  cm and a transverse distance from the @xmath105-axis smaller than @xmath40  cm .",
    "further cuts were applied to reject beam - scrapping and beam - halo events .",
    "finally , the energy threshold of @xmath54  gev has been imposed to suppress electronic noise in hf .    in this study ,",
    "the measurement of energy flow has been made at detector level in the pseudorapidity range @xmath2 covered by the hf calorimeters .",
    "the energy flow ratio , estimated in this analysis , is defined as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the number of selected events , @xmath109 is the energy deposition integrated over @xmath110 in the region @xmath111 , @xmath112 refers to either @xmath4  tev or @xmath5  tev , whereas @xmath113 refers to @xmath114  tev .",
    "the pseudorapidity range is divided into five bins with a size of @xmath115 in units of @xmath37 following the transverse segmentation of the hf calorimeters . in figures  5 and 6 ,",
    "the energy flow ratio is shown for different collision energies as the average of the hf(+ ) and hf( ) responses .    in these plots , uncorrected data without systematic uncertainties are compared to simulated events obtained from pythia tune d6 t . as can be clearly seen , the energy flow gets larger at forward rapidities and with increasing centre - of - mass energy .",
    "apart from that , it should be noted that the obtained results do approximately agree with the monte carlo predictions .",
    "however , no conclusions on the quality of the description can be drawn in this early study due to the missing systematic effects .",
    "a very rich forward physics program can be made with the cms detector at the lhc due to the unprecedented kinematic coverage of the forward region .",
    "all the cms forward detectors have been successfully commissioned in 2009 and currently take collision data .",
    "the first measurement of the forward energy flow has been performed and forward jets at @xmath116 have been observed for the first time at hadron colliders .",
