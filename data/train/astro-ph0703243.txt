    "it is well - known that the rcs of spiral galaxies show a non - keplerian circular velocity profile which can not be explained by considering a newtonian gravitational potential generated by the baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "current possible explanation of this controversy includes , among others , the postulate of a new yet not detected state of matter , the dark matter @xcite , a phenomenological modification of the newtonian dynamics @xcite , and higher order gravitational theories ( originally devoted to solve the dark energy issue , see e.g. , @xcite ) .    the recent theory proposed by capozziello",
    ", cardone @xmath1 troisi 2007 ( hereafter cct ) , modifies the usual newtonian potential generated by baryonic matter in such a way that the predicted galaxy kinematics and the observed one have a much better agreement .",
    "they consider power - law fourth order theories of gravity obtained by replacing in the gravity action the ricci scalar @xmath2 with a function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a slope parameter .",
    "the idea is that the newtonian potential generated by a point - like source gets modified in to @xmath5\\ } \\label{eq : phi},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a function of the slope @xmath4 , and @xmath7 is a scale length parameter .",
    "it turns out that in this theory @xmath8 is a universal constant while @xmath7 depends on the particular gravitating system being studied . in a virialized system",
    "the circular velocity is related to the derivative of the potential through @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear that ( [ eq : phi ] ) may help in the explanation of the circular velocity observed in spirals .",
    "we remark that any proposed solution to the galaxy rc phenomenon must not only fit well the kinematics but , equally important , also have best - fit values of the mass model parameters that are consistent with well studied global properties of galaxies .    for a sample of 15 low surface brightness galaxies",
    "the model described in cct was fairly able to fit the rcs .",
    "however , in our view , the relevance of their finding is limited by the following considerations :    * the sample contains several objects whose rcs are not smooth , symmetric and extended to large radii * the sample contains only low surface brightness galaxies while a wider sample is desirable * the universal parameter @xmath4 is not estimated by the analysis itself but it is taken from other observations .    in the present work",
    "we generalize the results of capozziello _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 and test a wider and fairer sample of spirals , improving the analysis methodology .",
    "our goal is to perform a check of their model on galactic scales in order to investigate its consistency and universality .",
    "the plan of this article is the following : in sect.2 we briefly summarize the main theoretical results described in cct relevant for the analysis of our sample . in sect.3",
    "we present our sample and methodology of analysis . in sect.4",
    "the results are presented and finally the conclusions in sect.5 .",
    "the theory proposed by capozziello _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 is an example of @xmath10 theory of gravity @xcite . in these theories",
    "the gravitational action is defined to be : @xmath11 \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the metric determinant , @xmath2 is the ricci scalar and @xmath13 is the matter lagrangian . they consider : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant to give correct dimensions to the action and @xmath4 is the slope parameter .",
    "the modified einstein equation is obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric components .    solving the vacuum field equations for a schwarzschild - like metric in the newtonian limit of weak gravitational fields and low velocities , the modified gravitational potential for the case of a point - like source of mass @xmath16 ,",
    "is given by ( [ eq : phi ] ) , where the relation between the slope parameter @xmath4 and @xmath8 ( see detailed calculation in cct ) is given by : @xmath17 note that for @xmath18 the usual newtonian potential is recovered .",
    "the large and small scale behavior of the total potential constrain the parameter @xmath8 to be @xmath19 .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : phi ] ) can be generalized to extended systems with a given density distribution @xmath20 by simply writing : @xmath21\\}\\nonumber\\\\ ~ & = & \\phi_{n}(r)+\\phi_{c}(r ) \\label{eq : tot},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 represents the usual newtonian potential and @xmath23 the additional correction . in this way",
    ", the newtonian potential can be recuperated when @xmath24 the solution for the specific density distribution relevant for spiral galaxies is described in the following paragraph .",
    "we selected two samples of galaxies : a first with 15 galaxies , called _ sample a _ , that represents the best available rcs to study the mass distribution of luminous and/or dark matter , and it has been used in works concerning modifications of gravity and the core / cusp controversy @xcite .",
    "this sample includes nearby galaxies of different surface brightness : ddo 47 @xcite ; eso 116-g12 , eso 287-g13 , ngc 7339 , ngc 1090 @xcite ; ugc 8017 , ugc 10981 , ugc 11455 @xcite ; m 31 , m 33 @xcite ; ic 2574 @xcite , ngc 5585 @xcite , ngc 6503 @xcite , ngc 2403 @xcite , ngc 55 @xcite .",
    "this sample is the most suitable for a fair test of theories like the one of capozziello _ et al . _",
    "2007 :    * the rcs are smooth , symmetric and extended to large radii . *",
    "the galaxies present a very small bulge so that it can be neglected in the mass model to a good approximation . *",
    "the luminosity profile is well measured and presents a smooth behavior * the data are uniform in quality up to the maximal radii of each galaxy .",
    "let us notice that in some of these galaxies h@xmath25 and hi rcs are both available and in these cases they agree well where they coexist .",
    "we also considered a second sample called _ sample b _ consisting of 15 selected objects from sanders & mcgaugh 2002 that has been used to test mond .",
    "this sample consists of the following galaxies : ugc 6399 , ugc 6983 , ugc 6917 , ngc 3972 , ngc 4085 , ngc 4183 , ngc 3917 , ngc 3949 , ngc 4217 , ngc 3877 , ngc 4157 , ngc 3953 , ngc 4100 @xcite ; ngc 300 @xcite ; ugc 128 @xcite .",
    "although these galaxies do not fulfill all the requirements of _ sample a _ we have analyzed them for completeness sake .",
    "the properties of the galaxies of the two samples are listed in table 1 .",
    "notice that the theory of capozziello _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 requires an analysis with a sample of high quality galaxies , as described above , where each luminous profile plays an important role , whereas this is not the case in mond .",
    "we decompose the total circular velocity into stellar and gaseous contributions .",
    "available photometry and radio observations show that the stars and the gas in our sample of galaxies are distributed in an infinitesimal thin and circular symmetric disk .",
    "while the hi surface luminosity density distribution @xmath26 gives a direct measurement of the gas mass , optical observations show that the stars have an exponential distribution : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the disk mass and @xmath29 is the scale length , the latter being measured directly from the optical observations , while @xmath30 is kept as a free parameter of our analysis .",
    "the distribution of the luminous matter in spiral galaxies has to a good extend cylindrical symmetry , hence using cylindrical coordinates , the potential ( [ eq : tot ] ) reads @xmath31\\}.\\label{eq : cyl}\\ ] ] @xmath32 is the surface density distribution of the stars , given by ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , or of the gas , given by an interpolation of the hi data points up to the last measured point . @xmath8 and @xmath7 are free parameters of the theory , with the latter galaxy dependent .",
    "we neglected the gas contribution to the mass density for radii larger than the last measured point , however we checked the goodness of this approximation by extending the distribution with a different kind of decreasing smooth curves and realized that error made in the truncated approximation is small enough to be neglected .    defining @xmath33 , we can express the distance between two points in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath34 .",
    "the derivation of the circular velocity due to the marked term of equation ( [ eq : cyl ] ) , that we call @xmath35 , is now direct : @xmath36 where the integral is defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 written in terms of confluent hyper - geometric function : @xmath39+[(k^{2}-2)r'+k^2 r]\\:_{2 } f_{1}[{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3-\\beta}{2}},{2},k^{2}]$ ] .",
    "the total circular velocity is the sum of each squared contribution : @xmath40 where the @xmath41 and @xmath42 subscripts refer to the different contributions of luminous matter to the total potential ( [ eq : tot ] ) .",
    "n _ and _ c _ subscripts refer to the newtonian and the additional correction potentials .",
    "let us recall that we can write @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the gravitational constant and the quantity @xmath46 is a combination of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "galaxies ugc 8017 , m 31 , ugc 11455 and ugc 10981 presents a very small amount of gas and for this reason it has been neglected in the analysis .",
    "notice that the correction to the newtonian potential in equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) may be negative and this would lead to a negative value of @xmath47 . in figures 1 and 2 however the velocities @xmath48 are shown only in the ranges of @xmath49 where their square are positive .    in a first step ,",
    "the rcs are @xmath50 best - fitted with the following free parameters : the slope ( @xmath8 ) and the scale length ( @xmath51 ) of the theory , and the gas mass fraction ( @xmath52 ) related to the disk mass simply by @xmath53 .",
    "the errors for the best fit values of the free parameters are calculated at one standard deviation with the @xmath54 rule . from the results of these fits we get a mean value of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . in the second step",
    "we redo the best - fit fixing the slope parameter at @xmath57 keeping as free parameters only @xmath7 and @xmath52 .",
    "notice that in a previous paper @xcite , a mean value of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) has been obtained , perfectly compatible with our result .",
    "this parameter however , is well constrained from sneia observations to be @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , also compatible with our measurements . in our analysis",
    "the value @xmath62 is the most favorable for explaining the rcs : different values of @xmath8 from the one we adopt here lead to worse performance .",
    "we summarize the results of our analysis in figures 1 and 2 and table 1martins / home.html ] . in general",
    "we find for all galaxies :    * the velocity model @xmath63 well fitting the rcs * acceptable values for the stellar mass - to - light ratio * too vast range for values of the gas fraction ( 0@xmath64 ) * not clear comprehension for the big variation of values for the scale length parameter ( 0.005 kpc@xmath651.53 kpc ) .",
    "the residuals of the measurements with respect to the best - fit mass model are in most of the cases compatible with the error - bars , see figures 1 and 2 , though three galaxies show significant deviations : ngc 6503 , ngc 2403 and m 33 .",
    "we also find acceptable values for the b - band mass - to - light ratio parameter for most of the galaxies , for which we should have approximately @xmath66 and a positive correlation between b - luminosity ; @xmath30 is the disk mass and @xmath67 is the b - band galaxy luminosity ] and @xmath68 @xcite : @xmath69m_{\\odot}\\label{eq : salucci99},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 $ ] . in detail",

    "the model analyzed in this article yields better results on galactic scales than @xmath72 cold dark matter models , where in the latter these galaxies have serious problems like marginal fits and unreasonable values for the stellar mass - to - light ratio , see e.g. , frigerio martins & salucci 2007 and gentile _ et al .",
