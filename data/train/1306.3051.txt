    "the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation has been a great success in understanding interacting many - body quantum systems in all fields of physics .",
    "however , the beyond mean - field effects ( e.g. , the nuclear vibration and rotation ) are missing in the hfb calculations .",
    "methods that go beyond mean - field , such as the generator coordinate method(gcm ) and the projection method , are expected to take those missing effects into consideration and present better description of the many - body quantum system . in the beyond mean - field calculations ,",
    "operator matrix elements and overlaps between multi - quasiparticle hfb states are basic blocks .",
    "these matrix elements and overlaps can be evaluated using the generalized wick s theorem ( gwt)@xcite , or equivalently using pfaffian @xcite , or using the compact formula in ref.@xcite . however , in the efficient calculations ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , all of the matrix elements and overlaps require the value of the overlap between hfb vacua .    thus , the reliable and accurate evaluation of the overlap between hfb vacua is very important for the stability and the efficiency of the beyond mean - field calculations . especially in cases near to the egido pole @xcite , the overlap between hfb vacua is very tiny , and a small error could lead to a large uncertainty of the matrix elements . in the past , numerical calculations of the overlap were performed with the onishi formula @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the onishi formula leaves the sign of the overlap undefined due to the square root of a determinant .",
    "several efforts have been made to overcome this sign problem @xcite . in 2009 , robledo proposed a different overlap formula with the pfaffian rather than the determinant @xcite .",
    "this formula completely solves the sign problem but requires the inversion of the matrix @xmath8 in the bogoliubov transformation . to avoid the singularity of @xmath8 , the formula for the limit when several orbits are fully occupied",
    "is given in ref .",
    "simultaneously , the limit when some orbits are exact empty was also considered to reduce the computational cost .",
    "meanwhile , various pfaffian formulae for the overlap between hfb vacua have been proposed by several authors @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the overlap formula does not require the inversion of @xmath8 , but the empty orbits in the fock space should be omitted .    in practical calculation , one should first identify the singularity of the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "this can be easily tested with the bloch - messiah theorem ( see details in ref .",
    "the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be decomposed as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are unitary matrices . @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to the bcs - transformation and",
    "are constructed from the occupation numbers @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( 7.9 ) and eq . ( 7.12 ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the limits of fully occupied ( @xmath19 ) and fully empty ( @xmath20 ) levels have been carefully treated in refs .",
    "@xcite to avoid the collapse of the overlap computation .",
    "however , we note that in most realistic cases the @xmath21 s can be extremely close to 0 or 1 but not exact 0 or 1 . strictly speaking ,",
    "these levels with such extreme emptiness or occupation should be considered but may lead to exotic values ( extremely huge or extremely tiny ) of the pfaffian in the proposed formulae . what is worse , the pfaffian values are easily out of the scope of the double precision data type and cause the computation collapsed .",
    "careful treatment must be made to avoid such data overflow . in this paper , we implement an accurate and reliable calculation for the overlap between arbitrary hfb vacua in a unified way .",
    "for the cases of ( @xmath20 ) and ( @xmath19 ) , we treat them as the cases of ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath23 ) , respectively .",
    "the tiny quantity @xmath24 is chosen such that @xmath25 should be numerical zero relative to 1 in the practical calculation .",
    "in other words , @xmath26 should numerically satisfy @xmath5 . under this condition",
    ", @xmath26 may be chosen as large as possible so that the calculated pfaffian values are not necessarily too huge or too tiny .",
    "for instance , one can choose @xmath6 when using double precision . because @xmath27 is actually zero relative to @xmath28 in practical calculations , this treatment does not change the hfb vacuum at all . therefore , without losing the generality , we assume that all levels in the fock space are partly occupied , but some of their @xmath3 values are allowed to be extremely close to 0 or 1 . ideally , @xmath29 are nonsingular in our assumption , and we can derive a new formula for the overlap between the hfb vacua based on the work of bertsch and robledo @xcite . this formula is especially convenient for the symmetry restoration .",
    "numerical calculations have been carried out for heavy nuclear system to test the precision of the new formula by comparing with the onishi formula .    in section [ theory ] , the formalism of the new overlap formula is given .",
    "section [ calculation ] provides an example of numerical calculation .",
    "a summary is given in section [ summary ] .",
    "we denote @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the creation and annihilation operators defined in an @xmath32-dimensional fock - space .",

    "let us present a brief introduction of the overlap of the onishi formula @xcite .",
    "the unitary transformation of the quasi - particles under rotation @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 the onishi formula is then expressed as ( see ref.@xcite ) , @xmath93}e^{-i(m_n\\phi_n+m_p\\phi_p)/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the numbers of neutron and proton orbits in the fock space , respectively . the value of @xmath96 $ ] is a complex number , and the sign of the square root",
    "is left undefined .",
    "extra efforts must be made to determine the sign before the application of the onishi formula .",
    "for instance , in the projected shell model @xcite without particle number projection , the overlap between the bcs vacua is real and positive , thus there is no sign ambiguity and the onishi formula works .",
    "although the sign problem is solved in eq.([overlap2 ] ) and eq.([n3 ] ) , one can imagine that @xmath48 , @xmath97 are extremely tiny numbers by definition .",
    "thus @xmath98 $ ] is also very tiny , but @xmath99 $ ] should be huge .",
    "numerical accuracy of eqs .",
    "( [ overlap2 ] ) and ( [ n3 ] ) needs to be carefully tested .",
    "it is believed that the onishi formula is accurate except for its undetermined sign .",
    "so , it is helpful to compare the numerical values of the overlaps using eq.([overlap2 ] ) , eq.([n3 ] ) and eq.([onishi ] ) .    to demonstrate the accuracy and the reliability of the eqs .",
    "( [ overlap2 ] ) and ( [ n3 ] ) , numerical calculations are performed for the typical example of the deformed heavy nucleus @xmath100th . for projection , we should take @xmath101 , and then @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath0 matrices are obtained from the nilsson+bcs method .",
    "the single particle levels are generated from the nilsson hamiltonian with the standard parameters @xcite .",
    "the single - particle model space contains 5 neutron major shells with @xmath1034 - 8 and 5 proton major shells with @xmath1033 - 7 , i.e. , the fock space has 145 neutron levels ( @xmath104 ) and 110 proton levels ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the numbers of the active neutrons and protons are 96 and 70 , respectively .",
    "the quadrupole deformation is taken to be @xmath106 . here",
    ", we only consider the axial symmetry for simplicity .    in the no pairing case , the bcs vacuum becomes a pure slater determinant , which is a challenge for eq.([n3 ] ) because all @xmath21 s above the fermi surface are zero .",
    "consequently , @xmath107 and @xmath108 is meaningless due to the singularity of @xmath9 . here",
    ", we use the double precision data type and set @xmath109 for those @xmath1 orbits to avoid the collapse of calculation .",
    "therefore we have @xmath110 where , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are bcs vacua for neutrons and protons , respectively , and @xmath113 .",
    "the tiny numbers @xmath114 and @xmath115 are too far out of the scope of the double precision data ( @xmath116 ) . to avoid the data overflow ,",
    "we multiply the tiny variable by @xmath117 several times until the scaled absolute value falls into the interval @xmath118 $ ] . in other words",

    "th as functions of @xmath60 with euler angles @xmath123 , calculated with present formula [ eq.([n3 ] ) ] and the onishi formula [ eq.([onishi ] ) with ` + ' sign ] .",
    "re@xmath124 $ ] and im@xmath124 $ ] are the real and imaginary parts of the overlap . , width=288 ]    however , for the onishi formula of eq.([onishi ] ) , we do not need to change @xmath1 to @xmath125 .",
    "the overlaps for the neutron part , calculated with eq.([n3 ] ) and eq.([onishi ] ) , are compared in fig.[ov1 ] .",
    "the curves of eq.([n3 ] ) are continuous , but the sign uncertainty of eq.([onishi ] ) causes the discontinuity . however , if one copies the sign of eq.([n3 ] ) to eq.([onishi ] ) , one can compare numerical difference between eq.([n3 ] ) and eq.([onishi ] ) using the following quantity , @xmath126 , @xmath127 in all calculations , we found that @xmath128 with double precision .",
    "this confirms that a small change of @xmath21 from zero to @xmath26 almost does not affect numerical accuracy .",
    "however , it is crucial to keep eq.([n3 ] ) valid . yet",
    "notice that @xmath129 in eq.([n3 ] ) is obtained from a product of tiny and giant numbers .",
    "the same calculations have also been done with eq.([overlap2 ] ) , and we also get @xmath128 .",
    "thus we have presented an alternative way of using eq.([overlap2 ] ) , where we set @xmath125 for those empty orbits rather than omitting them@xcite .",
    "once the overlap is available , it is straightforward to perform the symmetry restoration .",
    "the deformed bcs vacuum of @xmath100th has been projected onto good particle number and spin .",
    "therefore , one can test how precise the numerical calculations with eq.([n3 ] ) satisfy @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 are neutron - number , proton - number , and spin projection operators , respectively . for the above vacuum state without pairing ( i.e. the ground state slater determinant ) ,",
    "the particle numbers of both neutrons and protons are good .",
    "indeed , our particle number projection ( using 16 mesh points in the integral ) shows that @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) , or 0 ( @xmath136 ) with numerical errors less than @xmath137 .",
    "calculations for the protons also have the same accuracy .",
    "this again shows the reliability of eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) .",
    "angular momentum projection is also performed on the same state in addition to the particle number projection .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath138 with ( @xmath139 ) is plotted as a function of spin @xmath140 in fig.[am ] . in the integral of the spin projection ,",
    "100 mesh points are taken , and the range of spin is @xmath141 , and we indeed reproduced eq.([sum ] ) with numerical error around @xmath142 .",
    ", as a function of spin @xmath140 at @xmath135 and @xmath143 using eq.([n3 ] ) .",

    ", similar accuracy has also been achieved .",
    "following the strategy of bertsch and robledo @xcite , we have proposed a new formula of the overlap between hfb vacua by using the pfaffian identity and assuming that the inverse of the @xmath9 matrix exists .",
    "this formula is especially convenient and efficient in the symmetry restoration , and has the same high accuracy as the onishi formula as well as the correct sign .",
    "the reliability of the present formula has been tested by carrying out the calculations of the overlap and the quantum number projection for the heavy nucleus @xmath100th . in the testing calculations",
    ", one has to be faced with two numerical problems : ( 1 ) the extreme ( huge or tiny ) quantities are certainly encountered , and we have properly treated this situation to avoid data overflow ( see the text ) .",
    "( 2 ) for those empty orbits with @xmath1 , which make eq.([n3 ] ) invalid , one can change @xmath21 to a small quantity @xmath4 to avoid the singularity of @xmath9 matrix .",
