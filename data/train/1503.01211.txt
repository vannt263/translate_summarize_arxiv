    "since the discovery of the first exoplanet system in the 1990s , planetary systems have been found in an increasingly varied array of architectures . with this variety has come an increasing number of models and theories to explain these systems .",
    "it has also been realized that stellar companions play a key role in the evolution of the planetary dynamics for some systems .",
    "there are several proposed ways in which binary stars can influence the orbital properties of exoplanets .",
    "one of these is kozai migration @xcite where the mutual torques between the binary and the planet transfer angular momentum , causing the orbit of the planet to become more eccentric .",
    "eventually the eccentricity becomes high enough that the planet approaches the star , which then tidally circularizes the orbit .",
    "not all exoplanets in binary systems undergo kozai migration , as it depends on the mutual inclination of the orbits as well as the architecture of the planetary system .",
    "@xcite found that it can account for about 30% of the observed hot jupiter planets , which matches well with the projected spin - orbit angle distribution of hot jupiters .",
    "the stellar companion can also interact with the protoplanetary disk .",
    "@xcite proposed that the stellar companion effects the protoplanetary disk by slowing the planetesimals in the disk and allowing the formation of planets .",
    "this requires a relatively massive disk , but can produce systems such as @xmath0 cep and @xmath1 cen @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest an alternative method in which an eccentric stellar companion leads to a strong periodic disturbance in the disk whenever the companion is at periastron .",
    "this leads to an eccentric disk that changes over time due to the interactions with the stellar companion .",
    "this can produce massive eccentric planets , depending on the initial position of the planetesimal .",
    "their modeling did not consider the initial creation of the planetesimals .",
    "circumbinary planets have also been discovered , where the planet orbits both stars in a short - period orbit , on the order of tens of days @xcite . in these systems",
    "the planet(s ) and the stellar companion are all co - planar implying that they formed from flat circumbinary disks . since their discovery there is considerable effort to model the formation and dynamics of these systems @xcite .    in the case of multiple stellar systems ,",
    "coplanar systems are rare . of the 2413 systems cataloged in the _ sixth catalog of orbits of visual binary stars _",
    "@xcite 48 systems have orbit solutions with all seven campbell elements for both inner and outer systems in hierarchical arrangements . of these ,",
    "only four have the possibility of being coplanar according to the precepts of @xcite .",
    "the various models of exoplanet formation in binary systems can only be fully tested when there are sufficient numbers of known systems , especially systems with relatively short binary periods .",
    "there have been a number of surveys to measure the duplicity rates among the exoplanet hosts @xcite .",
    "these surveys have revealed several interesting features .",
    "the frequencies of exoplanets among single stars and components of wide binaries ( semi - major axis larger than  100 au ) are indistinguishable @xcite . also , the population of exoplanets in wide binaries is essentially the same as the population around single stars , indicating that wider binaries have minimal impact on dynamics of the exoplanets @xcite .",
    "the population of exoplanets in binaries with semi - major axis smaller than 100 au is statistically different than those orbiting single stars @xcite .",
    "there are fewer exoplanets in tight stellar binary systems , but the exoplanets tend to be more massive @xcite .",
    "no planet has been detected in stellar binaries that have a separation of less than 10 au @xcite .",
    "that same paper also determined that multi - exoplanet systems have only been detected in binary stars with a projected separation larger than 100au .",
    "known close visual binaries are traditionally excluded from radial - velocity ( rv ) exoplanet programs because the presence of a visual companion degrades the rv precision .",
    "this intrinsic bias complicates statistical inferences about exoplanets in binaries .",
    "moreover , a faint visual companion that is itself a close ( spectroscopic ) binary pair can produce periodic low - amplitude rv modulation in the combined light that can be mistaken for an exoplanet .",
    "false positive exoplanet detections caused by unrecognized hierarchical multiplicity of their hosts may reach 12 percent @xcite of the total exoplanet sample .",
    "this is yet another reason to observe exo - hosts with high angular resolution and deep dynamical range .",
    "in addition to dynamical interactions , exoplanets and their host stars share a common origin , and determining the properties of that local environment for the star leads to information about the exoplanet .",
    "examples of this include metallicity correlations ( e.g. 16 cyg ab , @xcite ) , stellar rotation , and activity .",
    "this paper details two multiple star systems that host known exoplanets : hd 2638 and 30 ari b. additional stellar components were found in each of these systems by @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the systems and those newly discovered components systems in depth .",
    "the observations of the systems are covered in section [ observations ] .",
    "section [ hd2638 ] discusses the hd 2638 system and section [ 30arib ] discusses the 30 ari system .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ summary ] .",
    "the companions to hd 2638 and 30 ari b were first detected using the robo - ao system as part of a survey of nearby binaries with solar type components @xcite .",
    "we have copied the astrometry and photometry from that paper in order to do a more in - depth analysis of these two stars . for those unfamiliar with robo - ao , we provide a brief introduction to the system . robo - ao is a robotic laser guide star adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xcite that operates automatically in order to carry out high efficiency observing programs .",
    "robo - ao is currently deployed on the palomar observatory 60-inch telescope .",
    "robo - ao uses rayleigh scattering from a uv laser focused at 10 km from the telescope as the wavefront reference , and generates diffraction limited images with strehl ratios of 4 - 26% in the @xmath2 filter .",
    "the ao system corrects the high order wavefront aberrations with automated software that operates at a rate of 1.2 khz , sharpening the instantaneous point spread function across the science camera field of view ( fov ) . a bright star within the fov",
    "is still required to correct the tip - tilt motion , which is corrected by the automated data processing software .",
    "the robo - ao science camera is an electron multiplying ccd ( emccd ) detector with 1024@xmath31024 pixels ; the pixel scale is 43.1 mas / pixel , with a total fov of 44@xmath344 .",
    "the emccd is operated at 8.6 frames per second in science mode , with an exposure time of 0.115 s each .",
    "a total of 516 frames are gathered during each 60 s exposure , which are then combined into a single image for further analysis by the automated data processing software .",
    "both targets were observed with the sdss _ i ' _ filter @xcite , and additionally hd 2638 was observed with the sdss _ r ' _ and _ z ' _ bands .",
    "the data were collected during multiple observing runs in 2012 and 2013 .",
    "see sections [ hd2638 ] and [ 30arib ] for details .",
    "the robo - ao data are procesed by the standard pipeline , which is discussed in @xcite . that paper did not publish error bars for the astrometry measured using speckle processing .",
    "it did give mean errors on measurements of control binaries .",
    "these companions are fainter than the control binaries , so to be conservative we have set the error bars as 10 mas , which translates to 11 in position angle at 05 separation .      in order to confirm and further characterize the companions , we observed both stars on 2013 september 28 ut with the palomar observatory hale 5 m telescope using the palm-3000 ao system and the pharo near - ir camera .",
    "the palm-3000 ao system is a natural guide star system using two deformable mirrors @xcite .",
    "one corrects low - amplitude high spatial frequency aberrations , while the other corrects the higher - amplitude low spatial frequency aberrations .",
    "it is optimized for high contrast observations and routinely produces strehl ratios greater than 80% in _ ks _ band .",
    "the pharo camera uses a hgcdte hawaii detector for observations between 1 and 2.5  wavelength @xcite .",
    "the camera has multiple filters in two filter wheels . for hd 2683 we collected 100 frames in both",
    "the _ j _ and _ ks _ filters , while we collected 50 frames of 30 ari b in the same filters .",
    "after debiasing , flat fielding , bad pixel correction and background subtraction , the frames were coadded .",
    "after the individual frames were calibrated , we created multiple images , by coadding 10 frames into each image .",
    "the iterative blind deconvolution algorithm , _ fitstars _ , was used to measure the astrometry and photometry of the objects @xcite .",
    "photometric error bars were assigned using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "for the astrometric error analysis , we computed the standard deviation of the astrometric measurements .",
    "analysis of simulated binaries created using the technique of @xcite showed that this error is almost entirely measurement error .",
    "the other major sources of astrometric error are the errors in the calibration of the plate scale and the position angle offset .",
    "the pharo pixel scale has been measured many times with a combination of an astrometric mask and binary star measurements @xcite .",
    "the changes between observing runs are small . on the night",
    "these data were acquired , there was not enough time to repeat the lengthly astrometric mask calibration process , but we observed six calibration binaries and updated the plate scale and the orientation angle offset .",
    "this resulted in a plate scale of 0025@xmath400005 and a position angle offset of 07@xmath405 .",
    "the final error bar on the astrometry was the root sum square ( rss ) of the calibration errors and the scatter in the astrometric measurements .",
    "hd 2638 ( hip 2350 = wds 002930555 ) is a nearby solar type star with an estimated age of 3 gyr @xcite .",
    "it is paired with hd 2567 ( hip 2292 ) , another solar type star , in a wide ( 839 ) common - proper - motion binary .",
    "@xcite determined that the pair had a 99% chance of being true companions through a bayesian analysis of the measured astrometry .",
    "the astronomical details of the hd 2638 system are given in table [ tab : objects ] .",
    "the measured parallaxes from hipparcos of the two stars are slightly different . for hd 2638",
    "it is 20.03@xmath41.49 mas and for hd 2567 it is 17.63@xmath40.79 mas @xcite . if the parallaxes are correct , it would mean that the stars are separated by 6.8 pc , which would mean they are not physically bound",
    ". this would disagree with the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "independent confirmation that a and b are physical comes from their measured rvs being almost identical .",
    "+ 9.60@xmath40.3 km / s for a @xcite , and + 9.61@xmath40.01 for b @xcite . for the distance to the system",
    ", we will use the value for hd 2567 since it has the lower error bar .",
    "unresolved binary stars , such as turns out to be the case with hd 2638 ( see below ) , can cause errors in parallaxes and proper motions measured by hipparcos due to orbital motion in the case of close pairs @xcite and due to a cross - talk with the scanning law for wider pairs @xcite .",
    "this most likely explains the difference .",

    "we will need to monitor the system to eventually compute an orbit of the stellar system . also continued rv monitoring",
    "is needed to identify any additional planets in long periods or highly inclined orbits .",
    "continued monitoring would allow the measurement of the rv signature of the companion star which will allow a more complete orbit to be determined .",
    "it is conceivable that the newly discovered component , c , is a close binary masquerading as an exo - planet .",
    "we estimate that c is fainter than b by about 4 mag in the visible , so the observed rv amplitude of 67.4 m  s@xmath28 in the combined light of b+c corresponds to the 2.7 km  s@xmath28 amplitude in the velocity of c. the minimum mass of the hypothetic binary companion cb is then 0.012 solar , so it could be a 0.1 @xmath29 dwarf in a 3.44-day orbit with a @xmath30 inclination .",
    "this is possible , although statistically unlikely ( probability 0.13 ) . if , on the other hand , ca and cb had comparable masses , the rv amplitude of this putative binary would be about 70 km  s@xmath28 , and an orbital inclination of @xmath31 would suffice for blending with the lines of b and producing the fake exo - planet rv signal . in the light of the discovery of c ,",

    "hd 2638 bc and 30 ari bc both have projected separations of less than 30 au and add to the rather small number of systems with such low separations .",
    "the stellar companions have the potential to have been a key part of the dynamical evolution of the exoplanets . however , the veracity of these exoplanets has to be addressed in light of the new companions , to eliminate the possibility that these rv discoveries are false positives caused by hierarchical multiplicity .",
    "these systems strengthen the link between massive planets and binary stars .",
    "the astrometry of these binaries should continued to be monitored . in the near future",
    "this will hopefully detect orbital motion and provide an indication to the period of the objects . with a long enough span of observations , an orbit can be computed , which will provide a more complete picture of the nature of the dynamical interaction between the binary companion and the exoplanet .",
    "in addition to the system s astrometry , their radial velocities should also be monitored .",
    "this may reveal a trend in the rv caused by the stellar companion .",
    "knowledge of the rv trend coupled with measured astrometry will enable the computation of the full orbital solution .",
    "we thank the staff of the palomar observatory for their invaluable assistance in collecting these data .",
