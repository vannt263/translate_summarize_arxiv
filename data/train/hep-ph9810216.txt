    "standard electroweak theory violates baryon number via non - perturbative processes involving the electroweak anomaly .",
    "such processes are exponentially suppressed under normal conditions , but are unsuppressed at very high temperatures in the early universe .",
    "non - perturbative baryon number violation is a key ingredient in scenarios for electroweak baryogenesis , which attempt to explain the matter / anti - matter asymmetry of the universe in terms of the physics of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "such scenarios typically depend on ( among other things ) the equilibrium rate of baryon number violation in the hot , symmetry - restored phase of electroweak theory . , which is the case either ( a ) far above the electroweak phase transition or `` crossover , '' or ( b ) in the symmetric phase at the transition in cases where there is a first - order transition and the transition is not exceedingly weak .",
    "] the rate of baryon number violation  and more generally the rate of any generic non - perturbative process in high - temperature non - abelian plasmas  has long been a source of theoretical confusion .",
    "in fact , it is only recently becoming clear how the rate scales with the fine structure constant @xmath1 of the relevant gauge interactions in the arbitrarily weak coupling limit .    for non - abelian plasmas at ultra - relativistic temperatures , non - perturbative fluctuations of the gauge field",
    "are associated with magnetic fluctuations over distance scales @xmath2 ( to be reviewed momentarily ) . for a long time in the literature , it was assumed that the time scale @xmath3 of non - perturbative processes was also of order @xmath4 , and that the rate @xmath5 per unit volume was therefore of order @xmath6 .",
    "two years ago , we argued @xcite that damping effects in the plasma slow the time scale down to @xmath7 , giving a rate of @xmath8 .",
    "( see also refs .  .",
    ") more recently , bdeker @xcite has claimed that there is an additional logarithmic suppression of the time scale , so that @xmath9 bdeker has also proposed an effective theory for the relevant distance and time scales in the form of simple stochastic dynamics for the gauge fields .",
    "numerical simulation of this effective theory would give the non - perturbative numerical coefficient @xmath10 of the logarithm : @xmath11 for small @xmath1 .",
    "( no one has yet proposed an explicit way to calculate the constant @xmath12 under the log , and one should expect there to be sub - leading corrections suppressed only by powers of @xmath13 . ) the goal of the present work is to show that bdeker s results can be reproduced and interpreted through a simple argument based on the fact that plasmas are conductive .    before presenting the essential argument , let us take a moment to review the physical origin of the length scale @xmath4 associated with non - perturbative fluctuations .",
    "( for more formal arguments , see @xcite . )",
    "imagine a fluctuation of the gauge field of spatial size @xmath14 and amplitude @xmath15 .",
    "non - perturbative means that , for example , @xmath16 is not a perturbation in the covariant derivative @xmath17 .",
    "so non - perturbative means @xmath18 , and hence the energy @xmath19 of this fluctuation is @xmath20 .",
    "the probability of such a fluctuation in energy is exponentially suppressed by the maxwell - boltzmann factor @xmath21 $ ] unless @xmath22 . because of entropy effects , non - perturbative processes will be dominated by the smallest size scale for which the probability is unsuppressed ( since there are more small - wavelength degrees of freedom than large - wavelength ones ) , and so the characteristic length scale of non - perturbative physics is @xmath2 .",
    "static electric fields are screened by the debye effect on smaller distance scales , of order @xmath23 .",
    "for this reason , non - perturbative physics in the hot plasma is essentially magnetic .",
    "more technically , it is only the transverse degrees of freedom of the gauge field which are important .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the simple relationship between the color conductivity and non - perturbative dynamics at leading - log order , and reproduce bdeker s effective theory for the non - perturbative dynamics . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the somewhat confusing literature on color conductivity and present our own calculation based on the boltzmann equation with a collision term .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we argue that bdeker s effective theory is ultraviolet insensitive  a crucial property for numerical simulations .",
    "we now turn to the essence of the argument , which is quite short .",
    "it is based on realizing that the dynamics of magnetic fluctuations in plasmas is slowed down by lenz s law : conducting media resist changes in magnetic field . in the context of high temperature baryon number violation , this qualitative explanation of the slow time scale for non - perturbative processes is due to guy moore @xcite .",
    "let s make it quantitative .",
    "this derivation will be a little fast and loose , but its advantage is that the physics is very simple .",
    "imagine splitting the gauge field into soft degrees of freedom ",
    "those associated with momenta of order @xmath24 , and hard degrees of freedom  those associated with much higher momenta such as @xmath25 .",
    "the details of exactly how this split is made will not be relevant at the order we shall consider .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations is non - perturbative for the soft modes but perturbative for the hard ones .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the soft modes are also effectively classical  there are a large number of quanta in each mode because of bose statistics .",
    "now , treating the soft modes classically , start with the maxwell equation @xmath26 for the soft degrees of freedom , where @xmath27 and where all covariant derivatives are to be understood as only involving the soft gauge field degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath28 is the color current due to the hard degrees of freedom , which we shall later see is dominated by excitations with momenta of order @xmath25 .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the hard momenta of the particles which contribute to @xmath28 and the momentum components of @xmath28 itself ( which is bilinear in the fundamental fields ) .",
    "it is the soft momentum components of @xmath28 which are relevant in the context of ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) .",
    "plasmas are conductors .",
    "hence , for sufficiently small momentum and frequency ( exactly how small will be discussed later ) , we have @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the color analog of conductivity . the maxwell equation then becomes @xmath31 let us assume that non - perturbative processes will be slow enough ( which we will verify _ a posteriori _ ) that we can neglect the time derivative term .",
    "then the maxwell equation becomes simply @xmath32 in @xmath33 gauge , this is a simple first - order equation of motion : @xmath34    this equation is dissipative and describes the relaxation of fluctuations of the soft fields away from equilibrium .",
    "the dissipation results from interactions of the soft modes with the hard degrees of freedom , which are accelerated by and steal energy from the soft fields .",
    "interactions with the hard modes , however , not only provide dissipation for the soft modes ; they also serve as a source of thermal noise . in the above analysis",
    ", the noise has been implicitly disregarded , and we will need to put it in if we wish to describe equilibrium fluctuations . fortunately , this is simple to do after the fact because noise and dissipation are intimately related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in the language of an effective theory of the soft modes",
    ", equilibrium requires a delicate balance between the soft modes excitation from thermal noise and their dissipative decay .    to be more specific , note that ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) has the general form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the potential energy of the degrees of freedom @xmath37 ( which in our case is the non - abelian magnetic energy @xmath38 ) .",
    "such systems are common in physics , and a simple way to incorporate thermal noise is to include a random force @xmath39 : @xmath40 this is a typical example of a langevin equation .",
    "the simplest possible choice of thermal noise , gaussian white noise , reproduces the correct equilibrium distribution @xmath41 if the noise variance is suitably scaled with the amount of dissipation , @xmath42 this well - known result can be verified by converting the langevin equation ( [ eq : toy ] ) into a fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution .",
    "( see , for example , chapter 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "why should one believe the noise distribution is so simple ?",
    "first , the noise can be treated as gaussian if the soft dynamics of interest has a time scale large compared to the decorrelation time of the noise , which is caused by fluctuations of the hard modes . averaging the noise over time scales small compared to the soft dynamics scale but large compared to the noise decorrelation time , the central limit theorem implies that the resulting distribution will approach a gaussian shape .",
    "we will see later ( sec .",
    "[ sec : roughsig ] ) that in our case the relevant decorrelation time for hard fluctuations is @xmath43 whereas the time scale for soft dynamics is the longer scale @xmath44 asserted earlier .",
    "second , if the theory were linearized , then the fact that the spectrum of this gaussian noise is white noise would follow rigorously from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . more generally , any noise spectrum @xmath45 may be regarded as frequency - independent ( _ i.e. _ , white noise ) at sufficiently small frequency @xmath46 provided @xmath47 is finite and non - zero .",
    "so effective theories for long time scales can generally be expected to have gaussian white noise . finally",
    ", one might wonder why there could not be some non - linear coupling to the noise , in the form of a function @xmath48 multiplying the noise term @xmath39 in ( [ eq : toy ] ) .",
    "generically , the introduction of such a @xmath37-dependence would change the equilibrium distribution produced by ( [ eq : toy ] ) so that it would not correctly reproduce @xmath41 .    based on the above discussion ,",
    "let us introduce noise as in ( [ eq : toy ] ) .",
    "translating back to our particular system ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) , we obtain the following effective theory for the soft modes :    [ eq : eff]@xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are spatial vector and adjoint color indices , respectively .",
    "those readers interested in a more technical derivation of the noise term starting somewhat closer to first principles should consult bdeker @xcite .",
    "astute readers may notice a peculiarity of ( [ eq : eff ] ) : it introduces noise for the longitudinal as well as transverse modes of @xmath52 , whereas the effective theory is only meant to describe the transverse modes .",
    "( the longitudinal modes are the pieces of @xmath53 which contribute to @xmath54 and perturbatively correspond to polarizations parallel to the spatial momentum @xmath55 . )",
    "the noise - driven longitudinal dynamics generated by ( [ eq : eff ] ) is nothing more than a convenient fiction which simplifies the description of the effective theory and which does not affect the transverse dynamics of interest .",
    "we shall henceforth ignore this issue in the present paper and instead discuss it in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the effective equation ( [ eq : eff ] ) turns out to have the wonderful property that it is insensitive to how the soft modes are cut off at large momentum .",
    "( we will discuss this in greater depth in section [ sec : uv ] . )",
    "it means that one can ignore the soft / hard separation that was necessary to write ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) but which was never specified in detail .",
    "it means that ( [ eq : eff ] ) will be insensitive to short - distance lattice cut - offs used in numerical simulations .",
    "finally , it also means that such simulations will not be plagued by lattice artifacts , such as loss of rotational invariance , that were thought to arise in other approaches @xcite .    from ( [ eq : effa ] ) and @xmath27 , one can immediately see that the time scale of non - perturbative dynamics is given by @xmath56 so that @xmath57 thus , one need only know the color conductivity @xmath30 .",
    "there has been some confusion in the literature ( described later ) about this quantity , but the correct value was first presented by selikhov and gyulassy @xcite . the color conductivity is of order @xmath58 we will review later how to understand this physically .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : roughsigma ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : tscale ] ) then gives the time scale @xmath59 and so @xmath60 , which has the logarithmic enhancement claimed by bdeker .",
    "later , we will see that earlier estimates @xcite of the time scale as @xmath61 correspond to ignoring the effects of collisions on the conductivity .",
    "note that ignoring the time derivative term in ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) was justified since the characteristic time scale ( [ eq : tscale2 ] ) is much greater than the inverse conductivity @xmath62 determined by ( [ eq : roughsigma ] ) .    on a more quantitative level ,",

    "is defined ( in one - loop perturbation theory ) as the imaginary part of the pole energy for a propagating gauge boson . in particular , it is defined so that the _ amplitudes _ of plasma waves decay as @xmath66 .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard usage of the `` width '' @xmath5 of a resonance ( for example , of the z boson at zero temperature ) , which is defined so that the probability ( or equivalently the intensity or particle number ) associated with the resonance decays as @xmath67 .",
    "the relation is simply @xmath68 .",
    "] here , @xmath69 is the adjoint casimir , conventionally normalized as @xmath70 for the gauge group su@xmath71 , and `` @xmath72 '' means equality up to relative corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath73 .",
    "that is , no claim is made about discriminating @xmath73 from @xmath74 .",

    "the langevin equation ( [ eq : eff ] ) with the value ( [ eq : sigma ] ) of @xmath30 precisely reproduces the effective theory derived by bdeker @xcite .",
    "it s interesting to note that , if the time is rescaled , the langevin eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff ] ) is equivalent to the stochastic quantization of three - dimensional euclidean gauge theory . in that context , the time @xmath3",
    "is usually considered a fictitious additional variable , corresponding in simulations to monte carlo time .",
    "amusingly , the present application provides an instance where monte carlo time for gauge theories is actually real time , up to a calculable rescaling .",
    "we now review why the color conductivity depends on coupling as in ( [ eq : roughsigma ] ) , and show how earlier estimates of the time scale for non - perturbative processes as @xmath61 correspond to ignoring collision effects .",
    "begin by considering the current response to an external electric field in a _ collisionless",
    "_ ultra - relativistic plasma . for simplicity of notation , consider a qed plasma for the moment rather than a non - abelian one . if the external field were static and homogeneous , particles in the plasma with charge @xmath77 would respond to the field by a change in momentum @xmath78 over a time @xmath79 . for small deviations",
    ", the change in velocity of a typical particle whose energy is order @xmath25 would then be @xmath80 and the resulting current would be @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the density of hard particles .",
    "the current is dominated by the most prevalent particles in the plasma : those with momentum of order @xmath25 . the current ( [ eq : j1 ] ) grows indefinitely with the length of time the electric field is applied .",
    "there are two things which can cut off this growth of the current : ( a ) collisions , and ( b ) temporal or spatial oscillation of the electric field .",
    "stick with the collisionless plasma for a moment and consider oscillations of @xmath53 . as we ve discussed , the time scale for non - perturbative processes turns out to be slow .",
    "so suppose , for example , that the electric field varies in the @xmath83 direction as @xmath84 but not significantly in time .",
    "then current carriers , which have an rms @xmath83 velocity of @xmath85 , will move from regions of positive @xmath86 to regions of negative @xmath86 in a time of order @xmath87 this change in direction of the electric field felt by the charge carriers then limits the average current response to a magnitude @xmath88 if we identify the ( @xmath89-dependent ) conductivity as @xmath90 and take @xmath89 to be the inverse spatial scale @xmath24 for non - perturbative physics , then the time scale @xmath3 for non - perturbative physics would be @xmath91 provided we could indeed ignore the effects of collisions on the conductivity .",
    "this is the qualitative physics behind the more formal and quantitative discussions of refs .",
    ". corresponds exactly to the damping coefficient @xmath92 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "the divergence of the conductivity ( [ eq : sigmak ] ) as @xmath93 is cut off in real physical systems by the effects of collisions , as pointed out by drude in 1900 .",
    "let s continue to focus on a qed plasma for the moment .",
    "a charge accelerated by the electric field eventually experiences a collision with other particles in the plasma which changes the charged particle s direction by a large angle .",
    "such collisions randomize the direction of the particle and so randomize its contribution to the current . so the relevant time @xmath79 determining the conductivity ( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) becomes the mean collision time @xmath94 for large angle scatterings : @xmath95 the @xmath96 above just comes from the square of the scattering matrix element .",
    "the logarithm arises because the randomization of the velocity can occur either through a single large - angle scattering or through the cumulative effect of many ( individually more probable ) small - angle scatterings .",
    "is also known as the `` momentum relaxation '' time ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "if @xmath94 were the relevant mean free time in the non - abelian case , then the effects of collisions on the conductivity @xmath97 could safely be ignored when investigating non - perturbative fluctuations . that s because @xmath98 , and so it would be the collisionless time scale @xmath99 instead of @xmath94 that determines @xmath79 and hence @xmath97 .",
    "however , selikhov and gyulassy @xcite have pointed out that @xmath94 is not the relevant mean free time in the non - abelian case . in the non - abelian case , even arbitrarily small angle scatterings can randomize the current , not by randomizing the velocity of the current carriers , but by randomizing their color charge . the crucial difference with qed is that an exchanged non - abelian gauge boson , no matter how soft , carries color and so changes the color charge of the scatterers , whereas an exchanged photon is neutral .",
    "the relevant time scale for the non - abelian case is then the mean free time @xmath100 for _ any_-angle scattering , which is much shorter than the mean free time for large - angle scattering . specifically , @xmath3-channel gauge boson exchange , shown in fig .",

    "the result is then that @xmath108 where the scale @xmath109 of non - perturbative physics has been used as an infrared cut - off . using ( [ eq : sigma1 ] ) and comparing @xmath100 to the collisionless time scale @xmath99",
    ", the zero - frequency conductivity @xmath110 is then @xmath111 @xmath100 wins by a logarithm for @xmath109 .",
    "this means that , in the small coupling , large logarithm limit , the @xmath93 value of the conductivity , namely @xmath112 , is what is relevant to non - perturbative physics in non - abelian plasmas .",
    "some readers may want to know what feynman diagrams , in the underlying , fundamental quantum field theory , correspond to the color conductivity discussed above . in the next section ,",
    "we formulate a leading - log calculation of the conductivity in terms of the boltzmann equation . based on ( a ) the analogy of qcd with scalar @xmath113 theory ( both have 3- and 4-point interactions ) , ( b ) the diagrammatic analysis of transport coefficients for the latter theory and its equivalence to the boltzmann equation as explained in refs . , and ( c ) the fact that , in the gauge theory case , only @xmath3-channel scattering processes are relevant at the order of interest , we believe that the relevant series of feynman diagrams are the ladder diagrams shown in fig .  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "this is similar to the class of diagrams considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for qed .",
    "diagrammatic perturbation theory in this form is awkward and cumbersome , however , and we shall avoid it .",
    "the original calculation of the color conductivity by selikhov and gyulassy @xcite was clever but not absolutely convincing .",
    "for one thing , it was based on an approximation to the evolution of color distribution functions which assumes that there is no coupling between the different velocity components of a fluctuation .",
    "( we shall explain more clearly what this means below . )",
    "the approximation is incorrect in general but , as we shall see , does not affect the calculation of the color conductivity in particular .",
    "subsequently , heiselberg @xcite analyzed the quark contribution to the conductivity by starting with a boltzmann equation with an appropriate collision term .",
    "he obtained the same dependence on coupling @xmath77 as selikhov and gyulassy but a different numerical coefficient . as we shall later explain , this difference was primarily due to the use of a plausible but inadequate variational ansatz .",
    "selikhov and gyulassy @xcite subsequently published an alternative derivation of the color conductivity that also started from the boltzmann equation with a collision term @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the collision term they used did not account for quantum statistics of the hard particles and , as a result , they were unable to obtain a final answer without making some very rough approximations along the way .",
    "indirectly , therefore , bdeker s @xcite results seem to be the first complete ( albeit terse ) analysis of the color conductivity , even though that is not the language he uses .",
    "we present here our own direct derivation of the conductivity , based on the collision term approach , which will be more familiar to some readers ( and so perhaps more comforting ) than bdeker s methods .",
    "there are three scales relevant to understanding the conductivity at leading - log order .",
    "following bdeker , we will label them as ( a ) the hard scale , corresponding to momentum @xmath25 , and characteristic of the charges which carry the current , ( b ) the soft scale , corresponding to momentum @xmath24 , characteristic of the non - perturbative electric fields that the hard charge carriers respond to , and ( c ) the _ semi - hard _ scale , corresponding to momenta @xmath114 in the range @xmath115 , which ( at leading - log order ) is the momentum scale of the @xmath3-channel gauge bosons that mediate color randomization of the hard charge carriers .",
    "remember that the logarithm in the conductivity is a logarithm of the plasma frequency scale @xmath116 over the soft scale @xmath24 .",
    "if we tried to go beyond leading - log order , then the distinction between semi - hard and soft would blur , because soft gauge bosons can also mediate color - randomizing processes .",
    "we will describe the hard , perturbative modes of the theory by a boltzmann equation .",
    "this is well known to reproduce exactly ( at leading order in coupling ) a large variety of thermal results obtained by a more fundamental analysis of diagrammatic perturbation theory .",
    "this kinetic description is valid whenever the mean free time is long enough that the hard particles can be treated as propagating classically ( _ i.e. _ , on - shell ) between collisions ",
    "a condition to be discussed momentarily .",
    "we will couple the hard particles to a soft electric field , and we will incorporate the semi - hard mediated scattering processes into the collision term .    the requirement that particles propagate classically between collisions means that the de broglie wavelength and the collision times must be small compared to the mean free path and mean free time , respectively .",
