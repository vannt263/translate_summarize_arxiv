    "the gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are intense flashes of soft @xmath0-rays , serendipitously discovered by the vela test ban treaty @xcite and immediately confirmed by the soviet konus satellites @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of grb s has been discussed in several reviews ( see e.g. and references therein ) .",
    "the most important breakthrough in the grb s observations has been the discovery in 1997 of a long lasting x - ray `` afterglow '' of the burst grb970228 by the beppo - sax italian - dutch satellite ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) , which has allowed the identification of its host galaxy @xcite , making the study of grb s a `` multi - wavelengths adventure '' @xcite .",
    "according to a widely accepted ( and acceptable ) interpretation , the prompt @xmath0-rays burst and the delayed afterglow , are both powered by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of a relativistically expanding `` fireball '' ( or jet ) , whose primal cause is not known .",
    "this mechanism , qualitatively suggested by , has been refined by and put in its final form of a standard model by ( for a recent review see e.g. and references therein ) .",
    "the obvious expectation is that such a powerful highly relativistic explosion should be accompanied by emission of neutrinos and gravitational waves , thus becoming the herald of the new astronomy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review and update the current predictions about the intensity of emission in this two forms to be expected from grb s . in the following",
    "i will first review in  [ sect : energy ] and  [ sect : large ] the essential quantitative information on the energetics and the large scale distribution of the sources , which has been obtained from prompt and afterglows observations . in  [",
    "sect : neutrino ] i present a new calculation of the photohadronic neutrino emissivity in the fireball / jet system from which predictions about the observability of the diffuse neutrino background can be derived . in  [ sect : gw ] i reexamine the possibility that a similar stochastic background could be observed as an additional noise component in the long term integration of the signal from gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the total energetics involved in the grb s is the most important parameter for my subsequent emissivity estimate . a direct estimate of the rest frame energy output can be obtained only for bursts with known redshift . according to a compilation by j. greiner , available at ` http://www.mpe.mpg.de/\\simjcg/grbrsh.html ` , the number of grb with reliable redshift measurement of the host galaxy redshift , is about 20 .    the intrinsic isotropic bolometric ( from 0.1 kev to 10 mev )",
    "energy release , estimated from the fluence of 17 burst in the 30 kev -2 mev range , spans from @xmath1 ( grb990712 ) to @xmath2 ( grb990123 ) , with a median of @xmath3 and a dispersion of @xmath4(r.m.s . )",
    "however , it is to be emphasized that this value applies only to grbs with measured redshift .",
    "therefore observational biases in burst detection and redshift determination , might obscure the true underlying average energy output of the typical grb .",
    "however , keeping in mind this caveat , one can assume that the kinetic energy input to the expanding relativistic fireball is of the order of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fraction of the fireball kinetic energy that is converted into @xmath0rays @xcite .",
    "the afterglow light curve of many bursts shows an achromatic break , currently interpreted as the evidence for a beamed emission @xcite . in this case",
    "the emitted @xmath0-ray energy @xmath7 is obviously reduced by the factor @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 . in a recent paper @xcite present a complete sample of 29 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) for which it has been possible to determine temporal breaks ( or limits ) from their afterglow light curves",
    ". incorporating realistic estimates of the ambient density and propagating error estimates on the measured quantities , in agreement with the previous analysis of a smaller sample , the derived jet opening angles of those 29 bursts result in a narrow clustering of geometrically corrected gamma - ray energies about @xmath10 , with a burst - to - burst variance of @xmath11 .",
    "three consequences can be drawn , if this is true :    1 .",
    "the central engines of grbs release energies of the order of @xmath12 this value is indeed comparable to the kinetic energy output of ordinary sne , suggesting a connection between the two phenomena , also supported by the observation of bumps in the afterglows light curves @xcite ; 2 .   the large spread in observed fluence and peak luminosity of grbs is mostly due to a spread in the opening angle of the beam ; 3 .",
    "only a small fraction of grb s are visible to a given observer and the true grb s rate is @xmath13 in practice from table 2 of the paper by one can guess that the true grb s rate should be about 300 times larger than the observed one .",
    "it is clear that such a radical descoping of the energetics associated with the grb s explosion , has a fundamental impact on the physical interpretation , but has little or no impact , at the first order , in the predictions of their high energy neutrino emission .",
    "in fact we expect that the aperture of the beam of neutrinos emitted by photohadronic processes will be the same of the beam of @xmath0-rays emitted by electrons",
    ".    on the contrary the gravitational wave emission by grb , if present , will be in any case isotropic .",
    "we observe that the beaming could reduce the probability of detecting individual events , because the amount of energy to be radiated is strongly reduced . but this should have no impact on the prediction of a possible cosmological background originated by the grb , because in case of beaming we should assume that the rate of events is increased by the same factor .",
    "therefore we have that the total energy released is in the case of beaming will be in the average @xmath14    as we said already the above given estimate can be applied , only to the bursts with observed afterglow .",
    "since afterglows have been observed only for long lasting bursts with duration @xmath15 , it could be argued that the short bursts could be powered by a totally different central engine , whose energetic could be on a lower scale .",
    "some indications in this direction is given by the fact that the observed fluence of the short bursts is significantly lower then the one of long bursts @xcite .",
    "however one could argue back that the difference in the average fluence could be due to a markedly different large scale distribution of the two classes of bursts . in the absence of a any direct distance estimator , only statistical indicators of the spatial distribution of grb can be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "a recent analysis of the 4b burst catalog @xcite shows that the short bursts have essentially the same characteristic peak luminosity of the long ones , but their local space density is around three times lower .",
    "this applies to bursts shorter then 0.25 s , therefore the total energy output of the short bursts should be 1 - 2 order of magnitude lower then the one of the long burst .",
    "the common wisdom about the large scale distribution of the bursts is that , being a phenomenon originated by the collapse of short lived massive stars , they should track closely the star formation rate ( sfr ) cosmological distribution . in a recent paper have used three different sfr derived from other astronomical data to fit the observed log n - log p distribution for the bursts .",
    "their results imply about 1 - 2 grb s per million sn type ii and a characteristic isotropic luminosity of the bursts in the range @xmath16 .",
    "the best fitted models of the rate per unit comoving volume are shown in fig.[fig : rate ] .",
    "the luminosity - variability relation@xcite is a new entirely empirical connection , which has been proposed in analogy to the well understood luminosity - period relationship of the cepheids . having calibrated over a sample of 8 grb s with known redshift",
    ", the authors have applied this fit to derive the redshifts for 220 bursts . applying non - parametric statistical techniques to the 220 gamma - ray burst ( grb ) redshifts and luminosities derived in this way",
    ", it has been proposed @xcite that there exists a significant correlation between the grb intrinsic luminosity and redshift , which can be parameterized as @xmath17 , where z is the burst redshift .",
    "in addition , this analysis supports a co - moving rate density of grbs that continues to increase for @xmath18 .",
    "we have plotted in the fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] the different possible large scale distribution of the grb s , which is compatible with the observed log n - log p distribution .",
    "in the general framework of the relativistic fireball model of grb s , the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is originated by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons accelerated at the internal shocks , while the afterglow is due to the interaction of the external shock with the ambient material @xcite .",
    "the radius of the inner shock ( or shocks in case of multi - peaked emission ) should be of the order of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the smallest timescale observed in the burst emission , usually in the range 1 - 10 ms .",
    "a lower limit to the bulk lorentz factor of the expanding fireball can be derived from the @xmath21 self absorption in the burst at the highest observed @xmath0-ray energy @xmath22 .",
    "in fact given the threshold of the reaction @xmath23 we must have @xmath24 .",
    "a more detailed calculation @xcite shows that the optical depth is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the low energy spectral index of the prompt @xmath0-ray emissioin .",
    "therefore a bulk lorentz factor @xmath27 is required for the emission of @xmath28 @xmath0-rays .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the high magnetic fields and relativistic velocities of the internal shocks , can accelerate protons up to @xmath29 , corresponding to the range of the uhe cosmic rays . from first principles",
    "one can derive the rate of acceleration from the relativistic shock @xmath30 , thus even in a very short time , smaller than the coherence time of the @xmath0-ray emission , a huge maximum energy @xmath31 can be reached .",
    "however the shock acceleration mechanism is efficient only when the radius of the shock is larger then the larmor radius @xmath32 of the accelerated particle .",
    "therefore the more stringent limit will be @xmath33 , that assuming @xmath34 gives @xmath35 .",
    "but even in this case one can get @xmath36 with field of the order @xmath37 .",
    "the typical fields required in the burst for electron synchrotron emission peaked in @xmath38 range are @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "therefore the maximum energy imparted to the proton will be limited , in practice , by proton synchrotron radiation and inelastic scattering over the radiation field . the latter interaction will copiously produce pions , that subsequently decay into neutrinos and tev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the pion yield for the reaction @xmath40 at the internal shock has been calculated , under simplifying assumptions , by several authors ( see e.g. and references therein ) .",
    "all this previous calculations have included only the photohadronic production near threshold , where the photon scatters quasi - elastically with the nucleon that is pushed into an excited state corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath42 baryonic resonances : @xmath43 these resonances are produced with high cross sections ( @xmath44 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to these resonant channels , pions will be also produced at intermediate energies by the hadronization of the photon @xmath45 .",
    "the reaction proceed in practice as @xmath46 the importance of considering both processes , and not only the resonant channels , in photohadronic pion production calculations has been already stressed in the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition to the arguments given in that paper , one should consider that the photons which interact via the resonant channel should have energies in the range @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : kine ] we have plotted the cross section versus the energies , in the observer s frame , of the photon and the @xmath0-ray . if the low - energy spectral index is @xmath48 , protons with @xmath49 will produce baryonic resonances scattering on photons with @xmath50 .",
    "therefore we expect that the resonant photoproduction at high energies will depend strongly on the shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum , in a range well below the observed one .",
    "the theoretical expectation from the electron synchrotron emission @xcite is that the spectrum will level off due to electron cooling at energies @xmath51 and be strongly suppressed by self - absorption for @xmath52 . following this indication we have assumed a photon energy distribution given by the form empirically proposed by , modified to take into account the cooling : @xmath53     \\epsilon_\\gamma^\\alpha\\,e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)\\epsilon_\\gamma / e_b } & \\mathrm{if}\\ ; \\epsilon_\\gamma < e_b \\\\[6pt ]      \\epsilon_\\gamma^\\beta\\,e_b^{\\alpha-\\beta}\\,e^{\\beta-\\alpha } & \\mathrm{if}\\ ; \\epsilon_\\gamma\\ge e_b \\\\",

    "for the sake of simplicity we have calculated the combined neutrinos and anti - neutrinos flux , because in the multiple pion production it can be assumed that positive and negative pions are equally produced .",
    "the marked difference between the spectrum of muon neutrinos and the one of the electronic neutrinos is due to the fact that the first type of neutrinos are directly produced in the pion s decay , while the electronic ones are produced only in the muon s decay , which have suffered a larger energy loss . in fig.[fig : typ_nu_spect ] we show for comparison the neutrino flux calculated by , which is also in good agreement with this result . in fig .",

    "it is worth noticing that if the jets are accelerated by poynting flux @xcite the amount of kinetic energy going into the burst @xmath128 and the energy radiated in gravitational waves are strictly related , because the gw luminosity will be @xmath129 , being @xmath130 the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution of the torus , while the poynting flux will be @xmath131 being in this case @xmath132 the quadrupole moment of the magnetic field embedded in the torus .",
